PREFACE.

   In the Christian Psalmist, compiled twenty-five years ago, by the
   Author of the present Volume, he became known as a Hymn-Writer; and,
   since then, having frequently exercised his vein in like manner, a
   considerable number of his compositions have been republished (with or
   without leave) by Editors of similar Miscellanies, or in authorized
   Hymn-Books. Of this he has never complained, being rather humbly
   thankful, that any imperfect strains of his should be thus employed in
   giving "Glory to God in the highest," promoting "On earth peace," and
   diffusing "Good will toward men." But of the liberties taken by some of
   these borrowers of his effusions, to modify certain passages, according
   to their peculiar taste and notions, he must avail himself of the
   present opportunity to remind them, that if good people (and such he
   verily believes them to be) cannot conscientiously adopt his diction
   and doctrine, it is a little questionable in them to impose upon him
   theirs, which he may as honestly hesitate to receive. Yet this is the
   Cross, by which every Author of a hymn, who hopes to be useful in his
   generation, may expect to be tested, at the pleasure of any Christian
   brother, however incompetent or little qualified to amend what he may
   deem amiss in one of the most delicate and difficult exercises of a
   tender heart and an enlightened understanding. This indeed is "a thorn
   in the flesh," which the sufferer must learn to bear with meekness,
   and, if possible, to profit by the humiliation; though a versifier of
   any other class might, perhaps, be forgiven, if he indignantly resented
   it. It has been, on this account, that the individual (who now presents
   himself for judgment at a tribunal from which there is no infallible
   appeal,) has emphatically entitled his lucubrations,--"Original Hymns,
   by J. M., meaning only thereby, that they are now given to the world in
   that form of words, for which he can, at present, hold himself
   responsible; being persuaded, that they will be generally accepted with
   the same candour and indulgence with which a few of them have been
   extensively read by private persons, and introduced to churches and
   congregations by faithful and true ministers of Christ's Gospel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Having, on three former occasions, expatiated freely on Hymnology and
   Sacred Poesy, [1] I will close this egotistical preamble to the most
   serious work of my long life (now passing fourscore years), with a
   brief quotation from what may be esteemed a sainted authority on such a
   subject. Bishop Ken, somewhere, says, beautifully, humbly, and
   poetically,--


     "And should the well-meant song I leave behind,

     With Jesus' lovers some acceptance find,

     'Twill heighten even the joys of heaven to know,

     That in my verse saints sing God's praise below."

   And was not this hope prophetic! fulfilling continually to this day,
   nor ever likely to fail while the Gospel is preached throughout the
   whole world in the language of Britain! It may even be doubted whether
   there is a stanza of four lines in the compass of our literature, which
   has been so often remembered, repeated and sung, as the Doxology,
   appended to each of the good prelate's inestimable Triad of Hymns, for
   Morning, Evening, and Night.


     "Praise God, from whom all blessings flow,

     Praise Him, all creatures here below;

     Praise Him above, ye heavenly host,

     Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."

   And who that has learned this rapturous strain on earth, can be
   presumed to forget it in heaven, if he reaches that consummation of
   glory, and of bliss?

   JAMES MONTGOMERY.

INTRODUCTION.

   Twenty-five years ago, it was my happiness to be commended to the
   good-will of American readers in their own country, [2] by my honoured
   friend, James Montgomery: it was one of a thousand acts of unsolicited
   kindness for which I have been indebted to him during the period of
   more than a quarter of a century that I have enjoyed his confidence and
   his counsel. It is now my privilege, publicly,--not to return, but--to
   acknowledge the obligation "in kind," by presuming, without authority,
   and mea periculo, to prefix an Introduction to a work of his. I must,
   however, at the outset, utterly repudiate the possibility of a notion
   on my part, that any thing from the pen of Montgomery, and least of all
   such a volume as this, can require to be either introduced or advocated
   in any place where his mother tongue is spoken, where the love of
   English poetry is enjoyed, and where the influence of Christianity is
   recognized as leading not less to the refinement of the intellectual,
   than to the purification of the moral character of man.

   To the literary and educated circles of society in the United States,
   therefore, on the foregoing as well as on other grounds of universally
   acknowledged sympathy, the author of "The Wanderer of Switzerland,"
   "The West Indies," "The World [no entity: &] before the Flood," "The
   Pelican Island," c., has long been as familiar--may I not say always as
   welcome?--as to similar classes of readers in his own country. It is
   not, then, with any design of bespeaking for my revered friend a more
   hearty welcome, much less in any hope of sharing in that welcome, that
   I venture to present myself in his eompany on the present occasion. For
   however little any of his former works might have been presumed to
   require adventitious introduction, the volume now in the reader's hand
   stands least in need of it. For, to any people keenly alive to the
   importance of an orthodox expression of evangelical truth, in any form,
   or through whatever instrumentality, and who are, at the same time,
   sufficiently free from sectarian trammels to be allowed to welcome it,
   every new and happy embodiment of a precious Scriptural sentiment,
   wbether in prose or verse, becomes a fresh and, if not a social, at
   least a personal source of spiritual enjoyment and edification. I
   record this opinion the more willingly and distinctly here, because, if
   it applies generally wherever the mind of the true believer and the
   Word of God are alike "unfettered," it may perhaps be urged with a more
   especial and happy significance among a people whose sacred literature
   is remarkable for its sound, expansive, and practical character. For I
   entirely agree with Montgomery, that, "In no walk of literature have
   our trans-atlantic kindred so worthily rivalled, and so nearly
   equalled, the writers of the parent country as in works of divinity."
   [3]

   It may be objected,--the recognized importance, the influence, and the
   praise of sermons, whether as delivered from the pulpit or the press,
   must not be allowed to be tacitly transferred to compositions in rhyme.
   Perhaps not; and yet the taste for good poetry, the appreciation of
   congregational singing, and the consequent requirement and requital of
   the services of the minstrel or the vocalist--not more surely in the
   saloon than in the sanctuary--are sufficient evidences that the good
   people of the trans-atlantic cities and villages, have at least the
   same feelings and enjoyments as those of the "old country" in these
   matters.

   It may also, I presume, be affirmed of the leading orthodox communities
   of Christians in the United States, as of those in Great Britain, that
   they generally use in their public worship either some metrical version
   of the Psalms of David, the Hymns of Dr. Watts, the collection made by
   the Rev. John Wesley, or selections from some of these, with more or
   less admixture of "original matter." Into the relative merits or
   comparative importance of the works here named, or alluded to, it is
   not my present intention to enter; and this would the less become me,
   as I shall have occasion to cite higher authority than my own on this
   subject, in the course of this Preface. With respect to rhythmical
   versions of the Psalms for choral uses, I may mention, in passing, that
   having several years ago published a particular work on this subject,
   [4] I am prepared to assert that while certain adventitious versifiers
   of the United States, early and late, must be content to share with the
   elders of their language in Europe the moderate praise of having rather
   laudably aimed at, than of having perfectly succeeded in the hopeless
   attempt at giving to the sentiments of the inspired penmen the same
   impressive tone in the choir service-book that they possess in the
   "authorized version" of the Bible, they have, nevertheless, exhibited
   some specimens of a metrical rendering of the sacred songs of the sweet
   singer of Israel, which are not inferior to the best of those produced
   in the mother country.

   To come now more immediately to the author of the work before us, it
   may be proper to show what are his qualifications for the attempt to
   add "new strings to the celestial lyre"--new strains of sacred harmony
   to those which the church has so long possessed and approved, and this
   without the risk on his part of lessening a well-earned poetical
   reputation, by an ill-timed contest for the cheap distinction of a
   merely religious versifier. Those persons who know any thing of the
   early life and education of James Montgomery, as sketched by himself in
   the Preface to his Collected Poems, will remember that he was born and
   brought up among the Moravians, a people in whose public worship and
   private devotions singing, whether aided by instrumental accompaniment
   or not, always formed a large and delightful element. In this branch of
   divine service, as maintained in the church of his fathers, the
   youthful poet took an early and an abiding interest; and, as might be
   expected, in imitations of the simple but heart-touching compositions
   of the Hymn Book then in use among the Brethren, and long afterwards
   revised by him, the earliest kindlings of his genius manifested
   themselves. Soon after he came to reside in Sheffield, some years
   before the commencement of the present century, and thenceforward, as
   his poetical reputation increased, and his religious character
   developed itself, with a singular freedom from sectarian exclusiveness,
   and coincidently with the origin of those various institutions of piety
   which have so greatly distinguished our times, he was often called upon
   to render his rhythmical skill tributary to devotion, by the production
   of hymns for occasional purposes. Among the welcome, or, at least,
   willingly gratified petitioners for services of this kind were not
   merely the managers of Sunday-school, Missionary, and [no entity: &]
   Bible-Society anniversaries, c., in the town where he resided, and who
   could urge the local plea of religious citizenship, but the compilers
   of Hymn Books in every part of the United Kingdom. To such an extent
   had the taste of the Poet, and the solicitations of his admirers,
   concurred in this heavenward direction, that, in 1825, he comprised, in
   a published work, which I shall presently more particularly describe,
   one hundred Original Hymns. He also tried his hand upon compositions in
   metre founded on the Psalms; the result of which experiment he
   published, in 1822, under the title of "Songs of Zion." To these
   "Imitations," as the author called them--sixty-seven in number--he
   affixed a very brief preface, in which he says, "he would venture to
   hope that, by avoiding the rugged literality of some, and the diffusive
   paraphrases of others, he may, in a few instances, have approached
   nearer than either of them have generally done to the ideal model of
   what devotional poems, in a modern tongue, grounded upon the subjects
   of ancient psalms, yet suited for Christian edification, ought to be."
   The success and the value of this experiment will, no doubt, be
   variously estimated by different readers, as they privately peruse, or
   publicly sing the several specimens of the "Songs of Zion" which are
   comprised in the contents of the present Hymn Book.

   But Mr. Montgomery's connection with hymnology has not been confined to
   his own metrical achievements in the service of the sanctuary. Willing
   to impart to others, so far as "the art unteachable, untaught," can be
   communicated or improved by precept, the secret of his own successful
   practice, he has, in public lectures, printed essays, prefaces to
   books, and in private conversations, advocated the claims and explained
   the relations of sacred literature--and, in his hands, almost all
   literature became sacred--under the various forms which poetry may
   assume. At present, however, our concern is mainly with his opinions as
   they relate to such lyric compositions as are adapted to the
   elucidation or adornment of religious themes, the exhibition of
   Scripture facts and doctrines, or most chiefly to the expression of
   devotional sentiments and feelings in private, social, or public
   worship. Distributing the matter here alluded to under four heads, we
   shall have:--

   [2]1. An examination of the prejudicial opinion, grounded on some
   remarks by Dr. Johnson, to the effect that sacred subjects are unfit
   for poetry, nay, generally incapable of being combined with it.

   [3]2. The qualities requisite to give to authors and hymns a title to
   acknowledged excellence.

   [4]3. An estimate of the comparative merits of some of the more
   celebrated composers of this class; and,

   [5]4. A consideration of the claims of Montgomery to his recognised
   rank as a hymnologist.

   I. In proceeding to rebut the ignorant assumption of the
   incompatibility of poetry with devotion, Montgomery says:--"It is true
   that there is a great deal of religious verse, which, as poetry, is
   worthless; but it is equally true that there is a great deal of genuine
   poetry associated with pure and undefiled religion. With men of the
   world, however, to whom religion is an abomination, all poetry
   associated with it loses caste, and becomes degraded beyond redemption
   by that which most exalts it in the esteem of those who really know
   what they judge.

   "But the prejudice alluded to is not confined to skeptics and
   profligates; many well-meaning people, who never took the trouble to
   inquire anything about the matter, in perfect simplicity believe this
   slander against the two most excellent gifts which God has conferred on
   intelligent and immortal man, upon the authority of Dr. Johnson. Let us
   see what that authority is. In his Life of Waller occurs the following
   passage:--'It has been the frequent lamentation of good men that verse
   has been too little applied to the purposes of worship, and many
   attempts have been made to animate devotion by pious poetry; that they
   have very seldom attained their end is sufficiently known, and it may
   not be improper to inquire why they have miscarried. Let no pious ear
   be offended if I advance, in opposition to many authorities, that
   poetical devotion cannot often please. The doctrines of religion may
   indeed be defended in a didactic poem; and he who has the happy power
   of arguing in verse, will not lose it because his subject is sacred. A
   poet may describe the beauty and grandeur of nature, the flowers of the
   spring, and the harvests of autumn, the vicissitudes of the tide, and
   the revolutions of the sky, and praise his Maker in lines which no
   reader shall lay aside. The subject of the disputation is not piety,
   but the motives to piety; that of the description is not God, but the
   works of God. Contemplative piety, or the intercourse between God and
   the human soul, cannot be poetical. Man admitted to implore the mercy
   of his Creator, and plead the merits of his Redeemer, is already in a
   higher state than poetry can confer.

   'The essence of poetry is invention; such invention as, by producing
   something unexpected, surprises and delights. The topics of devotion
   are few, and, being few, are universally known; but few as they are,
   they can be made no more; they can receive no grace from novelty of
   sentiment, and very little from novelty of expression. Poetry pleases
   by exhibiting an idea more grateful in the mind than things themselves
   afford. This effect proceeds from the display of those parts of nature
   which attract, and the concealment of those that repel the imagination;
   but religion must be shown as it is; suppression and addition equally
   corrupt it; and such as it is, it is known already. From poetry the
   reader justly expects, and from good poetry always obtains, the
   enlargement of his comprehension and the elevation of his fancy; but
   this is rarely to be hoped for by Christians from metrical devotion.
   Whatever is great, desirable, or tremendous, is comprised in the name
   of the Supreme Being. Omnipotence cannot exalted; infinity cannot be
   amplified; perfection cannot be improved. The employments of pious
   meditation are faith, thanksgiving, repentance, and supplication.
   Faith, invariably uniform, cannot be invested by fancy with
   decorations. Thanksgiving, though the most joyful of all holy
   effusions, yet addressed to a Being without passions, is confined to
   few modes, and is to be felt rather than expressed. Repentance,
   trembling in the presence of the Judge, is not at leisure for cadences
   and epithets. Supplication to man may diffuse itself through many
   topics of persuasion; but supplication to God can only cry for mercy.
   Of sentiments purely religious, it will be found that the most simple
   expression is the most sublime. Poetry loses its lustre and its power,
   because it is applied to the decoration of something more excellent
   than itself. All that pious verse can do is to help the memory, and
   delight the ear: and for these purposes it may be very useful; but it
   supplies nothing to the mind. The ideas of Christian theology are too
   simple for eloquence, too sacred for fiction, and too majestic for
   ornament; to recommend them by tropes and figures, is to modify by a
   concave mirror the sidereal hemisphere.'

   One cannot but be amused to imagine how indignantly this wisp of
   dazzling fallacies and solemn truisms would have been dispersed, had
   they been brought within the scope of the powerful apprehension of the
   critic by any other person. Nor can we fail to remember, that the
   persons who were formerly most prone to adduce the dogmata against the
   alliance of Religion with "Poetry, the eldest, the rarest, and the most
   excellent of the fine arts," were almost as commonly the stoutest
   advocates for the influence of rhetoric and music--if not also for the
   merely esthetic achievements of architure, statuary, and painting, as
   auxiliaries to Religion; and this even when they did not also avow
   their own sources of Polyhymnic idolatry in the inharmonious and
   unedifying strains of Sternhold and Hopkins. And "the sum of Dr.
   Johnson's argument," says Montgomery, "amounts to this, 'that
   contemplative piety, or the intercourse between God and the human soul,
   cannot be poetical;' and in the sense in which he employs the words
   poetry and poetical, this may be readily admitted; but that sense is
   imperfect; for it is limited to the style, rather than comprehending
   the spirit, of poetry, a distinction quite as allowable as his own,
   between poetry and motives to piety. He says, 'the essence of poetry is
   invention;' his own romance of Rasselas is a poem on this vague
   principle. Poetry must be verse, and all the ingenuity of man cannot
   say a better definition. Every thing else that may be claimed as
   essential to good poetry, is not peculiar to it, but may be associated,
   occasionally at least, with prose. Prose, on the other hand, cannot be
   changed into verse, without ceasing to be prose. It is true, according
   to common parlance, that poetry may be prosaic, that is, it may have
   the ordinary qualities of prose, though it be in metre; and prose may
   be poetical, that is, it may be invested with all the ordinary
   qualities of poetry, except metre. There is reason, as well as usage,
   in the conventional simplicity which distinguishes prose, and the
   conventional ornament which is allowed to verse; but gorgeous ornament
   is no more essential to verse, than naked simplicity is essential to
   prose. This, however, is a subject which cannot be discussed here; the
   assertion of the fact (and it cannot be contradicted), is sufficient to
   prove that there must be, in the compass of human language, a style
   suitable for 'contemplative piety' in verse, as well as in prose;
   consequently, there may be devotional poetry, capable of animating the
   soul in its intercourse with God, and suitable for expressing its
   feelings, its fears, its hopes, and its desires. Of course, this
   species of poetry will not parade invention, for the purpose of
   'producing something unexpected, which surprises and delights;' it will
   not be 'invested by fancy with decorations;' it will not attempt to
   exalt Omnipotence, amplify infinity, or improve perfection; but to
   'sentiments purely religious', it will give 'the most simple
   expression,' which will also be 'the most sublime,' and certainly not
   the less poetical on that account. Its topics will be 'few, and, being
   few,' will be 'universally known,'--an inestimable advantage in this
   kind of verse, because, if properly worded (and more is not required),
   they will be instantly understood, and impressively felt, according to
   the predisposition of the reader's mind, in all their force and
   tenderness of meaning. If nothing can be poetry which is not elevated
   above pure prose, by 'decorations of fancy, tropes, figures, and
   epithets,' many of the finest passages, in the finest poems which the
   world has ever seen, must be outlawed, and branded with the ignominy of
   being prose."

   "It is begging the question," continues Montgomery, "to say, that 'man
   admitted to implore the mercy of his Creator, and plead the merits of
   his Redeemer, is already in a higher state than poetry can confer.' He
   is; but what of that? he must follow the counsel of the prophet: 'Take
   with you words, and turn unto the Lord: say unto Him, Take away all
   iniquity, and receive us graciously, so will we render the calves of
   our lips. Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses,
   neither will we say any more to the work of our hands--Ye are our gods:
   for in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy' (Hosea, xiv., 2-3). Here is a
   prayer, dictated by the Spirit of God Himself, which is verse in the
   original, and ought to be rendered into verse when it would appear to
   be poetry, not of the simplest and severest, but of the loftiest and
   most embellished style: and does poetry here 'lose its lustre and
   power, because it is applied to the decoration of something better than
   itself?' Our critic says, 'The employments of pious meditation are
   faith, thanksgiving, repentance, and supplication.' He who denies that
   there can be a strain of poetry suited to the expression of each of
   these, in the most perfect manner, without either extravagance or
   impiety, must be prepared to deny that there is poetry in those very
   passages of the Psalms, in which, according to the judgment of all ages
   since they were written, there may be found the greatest sublimity and
   pathos." [5]

   The volume to which these sentiments are prefixed, comprises
   "selections in verse on sacred subjects," from one hundred and fifty
   English poets, many of whom, it must be admitted, have no other title
   to the special epithet of "Christian," than because they have
   occasionally shown themselves well aware that their best strains might
   be surely derived from, and, as certainly, elevated by, religious
   subjects: but, of course, many others have holier and higher aims; and
   have succeeded accordingly.

   II. But from the Christian Poet's defence of the use of verse in the
   service of religion in general, we proceed to his remarks on that form
   of it which is more particularly adapted to the service of the
   sanctuary. "A hymn," says Montgomery, "ought to be as regular in its
   structure as any other poem; it should have a distinct subject, and
   that subject should be simple, not complicated: so that whatever skill
   or labour might be required in the author to develope his plan, there
   should be little or none required on the part of the reader to
   understand it. Consequently, a hymn must have a beginning, middle, and
   end. There should be a manifest gradation in the thoughts, and their
   mutual dependence should be so perceptible, that they could not be
   transposed without injuring the unity of the piece; every line carrying
   forward the connection, and every verse adding a well-proportioned limb
   to a symmetrical body. The reader should know when the strain is
   complete, and be satisfied, as at the close of an air in music; while
   defects and superfluities should be felt by him as annoyances in
   whatever part they might occur. The practice of many good men in
   framing hymns, has been quite the contrary. They have begun apparently
   with the only idea in their mind at the time; another, with little
   relationship to the former, has been forced upon them by a refractory
   rhyme; a third became necessary to eke out a verse, a fourth to begin
   one, and so on, till having compiled a sufficient number of stanzas of
   so many lines, and lines of so many syllables, the operation has been
   suspended; whereas it might, with equal consistency, have been
   continued to any imaginable length, and the tenth or ten thousandth
   link might have been struck out, or changed places with any other,
   without the slightest infraction of the chain; the whole being a series
   of independent verses, collocated as they came, and the burden a canto
   of phrases, figures, and ideas, the common property of every writer who
   had none of his own, and, therefore, found in the works of each,
   unimproved, if not unimpaired, from generation to generation. Such
   rhapsodies may be sung from time to time, and keep alive devotion
   already kindled, but they leave no trace in the memory, make no
   impression on the heart, and fall through the mind as sounds glide
   through the ear,--pleasant it may be in their passage, but never
   returning to haunt the imagination in retirement, or in the multitude
   of the thoughts to refresh the soul. Of how contrary a character, how
   transcendently superior in value, as well as influence, are those
   hymns, which, once heard, are remembered without effort, remembered
   involuntarily, yet remembered with renewed and increasing delight at
   every revival! It may be safely affirmed, that the permanent favorites
   in every collection are those which, in the requisites before
   mentioned, or for some other peculiar excellence, are distinguished
   from the rest. Authors who devote their talents to the glory of God and
   the salvation of men, ought surely to take as much pains to polish and
   perfect their offerings of this kind, as secular and profane poets
   bestow upon their works. "The faults in ordinary hymns, are vulgar
   phrases, low words, hard words, technical terms, inverted construction,
   broken syntax, barbarous abbreviations that make our beautiful English
   horrid even to the eye, bad rhymes, or no rhymes where rhymes are
   expected, but above all, numbers without cadence. A line is no more
   metre because it contains a certain concatenation of syllables, than so
   many crotchets and quavers pricked at random, would constitute a bar of
   music. The syllables in every division ought to 'ripple like a
   rivulet,' one producing another as its natural effect, while the rhythm
   of each line, falling into the general stream at its proper place,
   should cause the verse to flow in progressive melody, deepening and
   expanding like a river to the close; or, to change the figure, each
   stanza should be a poetical tune, played down to the last note. Such
   subservience of every part to the harmony of the whole is required in
   all other legitimate poetry, and why it should not be observed in that
   which is worthiest of all possible pre-eminence, it would be difficult
   to say; why it is so rarely found in hymns, may be accounted for from
   the circumstances already stated, that few accomplished poets have
   enriched their mother tongue with strains of this description." [6]

   III. Among English hymnologists the two most prominent names are
   undoubtedly those of Watts and Wesley; though there are others that
   enjoy a proximate, and perhaps a few, in connection with single
   compositions, even a higher celebrity. "Dr. Watts," says Montgomery,
   "may almost be called the inventor of hymns in our language; for he so
   far departed from all precedent, that few of his compositions resemble
   those of his forerunners; while he so far established a precedent to
   all his successors, that none have departed from it otherwise than
   according to the peculiar turn of mind in the writer, and the style of
   expressing Christian truths employed by the denomination to which he
   belonged. Dr. Watts himself, though a conscientious dissenter, is so
   entirely catholic in his hymns, that it cannot be discovered from any
   of these, so far as we can recollect, that he belonged to any
   particular sect; hence, happily for his fame--or rather, it ought to be
   said, happily for the Church of Christ--portions of his psalms and
   hymns have been adopted in most places of worship where congregational
   singing prevails. It might be expected that, in the first models of a
   new species of poetry, there would be many flaws and imperfections,
   which later practitioners would discern and avoid. Such, indeed, are
   too abundant in Dr. Watts' psalms and hymns, and the worst of all is,
   that his authority stands so high with many of his imitators, that,
   while his faults and defects are most faithfully adopted, his merits
   are unapproachable by them. The faults are principally prosaic
   phraseology, rhymes worse than none, and none where good ones are
   absolutely wanted to raise the verse upon its feet, and make it go,
   according to the saying, 'on all-fours;' though, to do the Doctor
   justice, the metre is generally free and natural, when his lines want
   every other qualification of poetry. It is a great temptation to the
   indolence of hymn-writers, that the quartrain measures have been so
   often used by Dr. Watts, without rhyme in the first and third lines. He
   himself confessed that this was a defect; and though some of the most
   beautiful hymns are upon this model, if the thing itself be not a
   fault, it is the cause of half the faults that may be found in inferior
   compositions--negligence, feebleness, and prosing.

   "Next to Dr. Watts, as a hymn-writer, undoubtedly stands the Rev.
   Charles Wesley. He was probably the author of a greater number of
   compositions of this kind, with less variety of matter and manner, than
   any other man of genius that can be named. Excepting his 'Short Hymns
   on Passages of Scripture,' which of course make the whole tour of Bible
   literature, and are of very unequal merit--Christian experience, from
   the deeps of affliction, through all the gradations of doubt, fear,
   desire, faith, hope, expectation, to the transports of perfect love, in
   the very beams of the beatific vision--Christian experience furnishes
   him with everlasting and inexhaustible themes; and it must be confessed
   that he has celebrated them with an affluence of diction and a
   splendour of colouring rarely surpassed. At the same time, he has
   invested them with a power of truth, and endeared them both to the
   imagination and the affections, with a pathos which makes feeling
   conviction, and leaves the understanding little to do but to acquiesce
   in the decisions of the heart. As the poet of Methodism, he has sung
   the doctrines of the gospel, as they are expounded among that people,
   dwelling especially on the personal appropriation of the words of
   eternal life to the sinner, or the saint, as the test of his actual
   state before God, and admitting nothing less than the full assurance of
   faith as the privilege of believers." [7]

   This is just and generous praise; but it has always struck me as being
   less than its subject is fairly entitled to, in two or three
   particulars. In the first place, it may be questioned whether or not
   the wider prevalence of the hymns of Dr. Watts, as compared with those
   of Charles Wesley, be mainly due to the more unsectarian character of
   the former--may it not possibly be that they rather coincide,
   negatively at least, with the doctrines of a much larger sect, or with
   those of several sects? In the second place, the merit attributed to
   "the poet of Methodism," as having sung, however successfully, "the
   doctrines of the gospel, as they are expounded among that people," is
   liable to be taken equivocally, as meaning something that may be more
   or less than exactly scriptural. I merely hint at these points. But
   there is a third; I mean the poetical superiority of the hymns of
   Charles Wesley to those of Dr. Watts, whether we take for comparison
   the whole of them, as they appear in ordinary collections, or select
   single specimens from each, upon which it would be cowardice in me not
   to insist. But both these "sweet singers" have faults of versification,
   and some epithets and expressions of questionable propriety. Is it
   proper to point out these imperfections? Ought they to be removed? Both
   these questions are important. The worse than thankless reception of
   the Wesleyan Hymn Book by one of the preachers of the connexion in
   England [8] affords small encouragement to answer the first question
   with a practical affirmative; while, in the preface to the very volume
   now in the reader's hand, we have something like a formal and
   authoritative negative reply to the latter question.

   As it is one main object of this Introduction to present an abstract of
   the opinions of our author, as enunciated in three essays which are
   merely named in the Preface to his "Original Hymns," I must briefly
   allude to Montgomery's estimate of the metrical piety of another of his
   predecessors. No two individuals could be more unlike in their origin,
   or more dissimilar in their natural character, and their early history,
   than the Rev. John Newton and William Cowper; and yet, through the
   signal operation of divine grace, they not only became, after their
   equally remarkable conversion to God, singularly of one spirit in their
   life and doctrine--"one in Christ Jesus"--but they have left, in the
   "[6]Olney Hymns," an enduring monument of their friendship and piety.
   These earnest productions, even where most clearly marked by the strong
   opinions of the poet-preacher, or most deeply tinged with the morbid
   melancholy of the preacher-poet, are justly regarded as a precious
   legacy to the Church of Christ; and few are the modern collections of
   verse adapted for congregational singing which do not contain some
   specimens of them. In allusion to two large classes of these hymns,
   viz., those on portions of the Old and New Testaments, and those of an
   experimental character, the essayist anticipates and answers a question
   which must often have presented itself to others--"Are such
   compositions fit to be sung in great congregations, consisting of all
   classes of saints and sinners?" "It must be frankly answered with
   respect to the far greater proportion--No! except, upon the principle,
   that whatever may be read by such an assembly may also be sung. On no
   ground can either the reading or chaunting of the Psalms from the
   Common Prayer Book of the Church of England, or the singing of
   authorised versions of the same be justified, except on this--namely,
   that these are subjects to be impressed upon the minds and memories of
   the people, for individual application by themselves (when they can be
   persuaded to make it); but generally, for instruction, warning,
   reproof, correction, and example--in reality as means of grace. The
   part which a congregation of professing Christians can generally take
   in the routine of divine service--in reading, praying, responding, or
   singing--is a subject (considering what the real usage is) almost too
   awful to think upon in any other view than the foregoing. Confining
   himself to this point of justification alone, the writer of these
   remarks ventures to add, that, whereas singing is only one of the forms
   of utterance which God has given to man, not which man has invented,
   any otherwise than he may be said to have invented speech by the
   faculty which God gave him to do so--whatever a man may without sin,
   recite with his lips, in the house of God, he may also sing, when the
   same subjects or sentiments are modelled into verse, or set forth in
   numerous poems like the translated Psalms and other poetical parts of
   Holy Writ suitable for chaunting." * * * "This volume of Olney Hymns
   ought to be for ever dear to the Christian public as an unprecedented
   memorial in respect to its authors of the power of divine grace. Those
   may disparage the poetry of Cowper's Hymns who hate or despise the
   doctrines of the Gospel; they are, however, worthy of him, and
   honourable to his Christian profession. These first-fruits of his muse,
   after she had been baptized--but we must drop the fictitious being, and
   say rather, after he had been baptized 'with the Holy Ghost and with
   fire,' will ever be precious (independent of their other merits) as the
   transcripts of his happiest feelings, the memorials of his walk with
   God, and his daily experience (amidst conflict and discouragements), of
   the consoling power of that religion, in which he had found peace, and
   often enjoyed peace to a degree that passed understanding." [9] How
   exactly do these terms also characterise the author of these "Original
   Hymns." Indeed, I have transcribed the closing portion of the foregoing
   extract for the purpose of adding that there has been no man of genius
   between whom and Montgomery the resemblance is so strong as the bard of
   Olney. "Lamented Cowper! in thy steps I tread," [no entity: &] c., was
   the apostrophic language of the author of the "West Indies;" and,
   assuredly, not only in their common abhorrence of slavery, and their
   similar exemplification of the influences of evangelical religion, but
   in the Christian tone of their larger works, the simplicity and purity
   of their lives, and especially in the chaste and spiritual character of
   their beautiful hymns, the two Christian poets alike demonstrate that
   their inspiration flowed from the source indicated by the angelic
   messenger "who touch'd Isaiah's hallowed lips with fire."

   On grounds like those indicated in the foregoing remarks, not only have
   the hymns to which they specifically refer, but those in other
   collections, been exposed to the emendations of editors. Among the most
   obviously defensible of these interferences with an author's genuine
   text, are those which go to remove or qualify expressions which stretch
   perilously near, even if they lie really within the bounds of allowable
   phraseology. And here, I allude not to the assertion of those
   transcendant attainments of Christian assurance, holiness, and
   exaltation, about which the soberest professors of religion sometimes
   differ, but rather to those bold appropriations of the sensuous
   language of Solomon's Song on the one hand, and of the mysterious
   symbolisms of the Revelation of St. John on the other, which none but
   the most fanciful or the most fearless versifiers would nowadays adopt.
   At the same time, the unwarrantable liberties sometimes taken with
   favourite hymns, by incompetent parties, should suggest caution in this
   kind of dealing. [10]

   Notwithstanding, however, some discouraging indications, and the
   conviction that most parties would much sooner assent to a proposed
   revisal of the "authorised version" of the Holy Scriptures than to any
   alteration in the text of their repective Hymn Books, I humbly submit
   that the right of any man, or any sect of men, to adopt their own
   phraseology in devotional singing, is indisputable, at least under the
   following limitations:--

   1. Parties adopting the compositions of a living author, are plainly
   bound to conform to the terms on which he may choose to permit such
   use, either during his own lifetime, or so long as his copyright
   exists.

   2. The publication of an altered hymn, under the name of the original
   author, and without acknowledgement of such alteration, is worse than
   dishonest. It is the clandestine insertion of a spurious bud in a stalk
   of reputed excellence.

   3. Emendations of a literary nature ought generally to coincide with
   the original sentiment: in other words--should be what it may be
   presumed would have been the expression of the author himself had he
   possessed the abilities, or could he have anticipated the position of
   his editor. Hence, the most allowable alterations in old hymns, are the
   correction of obvious mistakes, and the supplantation of harsh or
   obsolete terms: the most reprehensible, those which purposely vitiate
   or subvert the primary meaning of the poet. These remarks are, of
   course, made with special reference to the unauthorised version of
   compositions intended to be sung; in other respects, the rights and
   usages of editorial interference apply to hymns as to other kinds of
   verse.

   The least hazardous way of dealing with unacceptable passages in an
   otherwise favourite hymn, is undoubtedly by simply omitting the verses
   in which they occur. This, I believe, would be the direction of
   Montgomery himself in such cases. He has indeed acted largely upon this
   principle in "The Christian Psalmist," where, it must be admitted, he
   has not less frequently exercised that reformatory process so
   emphatically deprecated in the Preface to his own Hymns. The plea of
   correction and improvement, irrefragable as it may be, when applied to
   his judicious touch, is very liable to be urged or assumed with equal
   success by the most dishonest or incompetent emendators. Still, as I
   have said, since every person ought to be allowed to use, and in a
   country where the exercise of opinion and action in this matter is so
   little restricted as in the United States, will select the most
   agreeable phraseology, even the perilous privilege of altering
   accredited hymns, as the alternative of losing for a single expression,
   or perhaps a single word, the pleasure and the profit of singing a
   strain which is at once elegant, instructive, and devotional.

   IV. We must now advert to the claims of Montgomery to the title and
   reputation of a hymnologist. In the work last quoted, he says, "One of
   the most precious uses of the sacred oracles is their infinite
   capability of personal application to the mind and the heart, the
   circumstances and duties of the Christian in every state of life and
   every frame of spirit." Hence, "The most illiterate person, who
   understands his Bible, will easily understand the most elegant or
   emphatic expression of all the feelings which are common to all; and,
   instead of being passive under them, when they are excited at
   particular seasons, he will avail himself of the songs put into his
   mouth, and sing them with gladness and refreshment, as if they were his
   own. Then, though like Milton's, his genius can ascend to the heaven of
   heavens, or, like Shakspeare's, search out the secrets of Nature
   through all her living combinations, blessed is the bard who employs
   his resources thus; who, from the fulness of his own bosom, pours his
   divinest thoughts, in his selectest words, into the bosoms of his
   readers, and enables them to appreciate the rich communications to
   their personal exigencies, without robbing him or hindering others from
   partaking of the same abundant fountain of human inspiration--a
   fountain flowing like the oil, at the command of the prophet, from one
   vessel into as many as could be borrowed, without exhausting the first,
   though the whole were filled. If he who pens these sentiments knows his
   own heart, though it has deceived him too often to be trusted without
   jealousy, he would rather be the anonymous author of a few hymns, which
   should thus become an imperishable inheritance to the people of God,
   than bequeathe another epic poem to the world, which should rank his
   name with Homer, Virgil, and 'our greater Milton.' After these strong
   words, but more especially after the freedom and severity which he has
   exercised in judging the performances of his predecessors, the author
   may offer, with many misgivings, the hymns in the following collection
   as his own. Tried by the standard which he has himself set up, every
   one of them would be found wanting." [11] The modest ambition and
   humble disclaimer embodied in the preceding sentences, characteristic
   as they are of the writer, will not be allowed to outweigh the estimate
   which the world and the church have long since formed of the man of
   genius and the Christian poet.

   In reference to the metrical compositions used in Christian worship,
   the poorest of them are generally as good as the taste of those who
   sing them; indeed, paradoxical as it may seem, more persons may easily
   be found capable of writing middling hymns than of appreciating
   excellence in the best. Ministers of religion themselves, when not
   compilers, [12] are frequently among the stiffest advocates for a
   severe sentence on him who shall venture to think out the meaning of
   the words of what he sings, as if the piety were in the tune, and the
   edification in the aim of this elevating act of devotion. Let, however,
   any competent person carefully and candidly collate these "Original
   Hymns," with the stringent canons of composition promulgated by the
   author in the passages above cited, and then let him try by the same
   test an equal number of the compositions of a similar character by
   other modern poets; the result will probably be both instructive and
   conclusive.

   Although labour is not genius, even in literature, and Montgomery would
   probably be among the foremost to deny that any one could acquire the
   "faculty divine" of the true poet by a mere apprenticeship to
   verse-making, he would, I am sure, be equally the first to lay stress
   on the supreme importance of cultivating any talent in order to its
   complete efficiency. Many persons who read his hymns, and other pieces,
   so smooth in metre, so sweet in their cadences, so natural and exact in
   phraseology, may suppose they are struck off at a beat, in moments of
   inspiration--in plain terms, that they are produced with as little
   labour as they are read. Nothing can be farther from the fact; for,
   whatever may have been the mode of catching and fixing first thoughts,
   the whole has been submitted to frequent and careful elaboration or
   revision. As it was my privilege to transcribe for the press the
   greater part of the matter of the following pages (of course, without
   the alteration of a single word of the author's final corrections), I
   may be presumed to know something of the process alluded to, from the
   character of his manuscripts, most of which presented abundant evidence
   of the limae labor; and in addition to this palimpsest appearance of
   the original copies, they were sometimes multiplied in variorum forms,
   one hymn, I recollect, existing in not fewer than ten different
   versions! I mention this fact to show to young persons, especially such
   as may happen to be gifted with the "fatal facility" of religious
   verse-making, how great a price even a veteran hymnologist feels
   himself bound to pay for distinguished success.

   In the language, not of hyperbole but of truth, it may be said that the
   hymns of the Sheffield poet present evidence of every variety of the
   excellence which he has pointed out in others. In "catholicity," they
   are not inferior to those of Dr. Watts; in "daring and victorious
   flights" of spiritual aspiration, they sometimes rival those of Charles
   Wesley; they are "very pleasing," like Addison's, not only when, like
   his, they celebrate the blessings of "the God of Providence," but
   because "the God of Grace" is "more distinctly recognised in them;"
   equally with Doddridge's "they shine in the heauty of holiness;" with
   Toplady's, "there is, in some of them a peculiarly ethereal spirit;"
   while often, like Beddome's, a single idea is ingeniously brought out,
   "not with a mere point at the end, but with the terseness and
   simplicity of a Greek epigram;" and all this is heightened and deepened
   by the affecting conviction that the best compositions of Montgomery,
   as of Cowper, "are principally communings with his own heart, or
   avowals of Christian experience; as such, they are frequently
   applicable to every believer's feelings, and touch unexpectedly the
   most secret springs of joy and sorrow, faith, fear, hope, love, trial,
   despondency, and triumph."

   It would be easy to adduce, from the book before us, examples of each
   of the foregoing forms of hymnic excellence, and perhaps also
   occasional instances of failure; for what human production is perfect?
   But I am--and without hesitation I confess it--too genuine and generous
   an admirer of the poetry of my venerable friend, to be implicitly
   trusted either as a discriminating or an impartial eclectic in such an
   undertaking. I shall therefore conclude this essay with a few
   miscellaneous remarks. Allusion has already been made to the "Songs of
   Zion;" one of these, commencing "[7]Hail to the Lord's annointed!" will
   be found at page 276 of this volume; it is perhaps one of the most
   elegant and mellifluous imitations of a psalm in the English language.
   Dr. Adam Clarke, who has quoted it at length in his learned Commentary
   on the Holy Scriptures, says the author "has seized the spirit and
   exhibited some of the principal beauties of the Hebrew bard." The
   solemn sentiments condensed in [8]Hymn 238, point to the fact that
   "Eternity!" whether the direct or casual subject of the poet's verse,
   seems to have been an ever-present reality to his mind, influencing by
   the awfulness of its collateral bearings and its final meditations. The
   several hymns on the Bible, the Sabbath, the advent of the Messiah, and
   the preaching of the Gospel, are exceedingly appropriate and beautiful.
   The same may be said of several of the compositions which are rather of
   a didactic, exegetical, or apostrophic, than of a strictly devotional
   character, and which are better adapted to be silently treasured up in
   the memory than uttered in vocal harmony. Of these, the verses on
   "Prayer," [9]Hymn 62, have probably been more admired by religious
   people in England, and form to a greater extent one of the "Pleasures
   of Memory," among old and young, than any modern essay of rhyme of a
   similar class. A considerable number were, as already intimated,
   composed on special occasions. If any apology were necessary for the
   perpetuation of these, it might surely be found in their titles
   respectively; for, however "few and far between" in their anticipated
   recurrence jubilees and centenaries may be, these exquisite mementos of
   their having been, will only be repudiated, if at all, by sterner heads
   and harder hearts than those which were in the first instance
   gratefully affected by them; to say nothing of the fact, familiar to
   most pious people, that poetical forms of "sound words," when embodying
   portions of scripture truth, even for fugitive purposes, are rarely
   allowed to perish in the first using.

   It need scarcely be added that the entire matter of this book, from the
   first page to the last--from the opening hymn of praise to the "Thrice
   Holy" Lord God of Hosts, to the corresponding aspirations of the
   closing Doxology--is strikingly evangelical; indeed, so complete is the
   inter-penetration of this hallowing element, that while there is hardly
   a single verse which may not be consistently appropriated by any
   denomination of orthodox Christian worshippers, there is not one that
   can be fairly pressed into any service incompatible with the doctrine
   of "salvation through the blood of the Lamb."

   I owe it to the delicacy of the gentleman with whose name and works I
   have dealt so freely, but not inconsiderately, in the foregoing pages,
   to say that, should this Introduction ever meet his eye in print, that
   will be the first intimation he will have of its existence.

   not only superseded the use of the old and new versions of the Psalms,

   made and printed selections suited to their own tastes respectively;

   The Creation and Dissolution of all Things.


   In the beginning, God said "Be!"

   And all things were,--heaven, earth, and sea:

   God, in the end, once more will say,

   "Perish!" and all shall pass away.


   But Thou, O Lord! for ever art:

   The orb of Thine eternity

   Is one great whole, without a part;

   Past, present, future, meet in Thee.


   Convinced of sin, my soul would bend

   Before Thee in the lowest dust;

   Yet to Thy Throne by prayer ascend,

   With trembling awe and childlike trust.


   O look in loving-kindness down

   On a frail worm with Thee at strife;

   Eternal death were in Thy frown,

   Thy smile will be eternal life!

   God the Creator.


   Praise the High, the Holy One!

   God o'er all, the first, the last:

   For He spake, and it was done;

   He commanded, it stood fast.


   At His word, from darkness light,

   Harmony from discord broke;

   Weakness started into might,

   Beauty out of dust awoke:


   Fire and water, air and earth,

   Heard His voice and hush'd their strife:

   Death itself, by wondrous birth,

   Grew the parent of all life.


   Plant and flower, and herb and tree,

   Sprang spontaneous from the sod;

   Sun and moon, and land and sea,

   Day and night, beheld their God.


   Fishes, fowls upon the wing,

   Beasts, and all that creep or fly,

   Every breathing, moving thing,

   Peopled forest, flood, and sky.


   But while all was fair and good,

   All accordant to His will,

   None their Maker understood,

   Mind and thought were wanting still.


   God, His glory to display,

   With His image crown'd the whole,

   Breath'd His Spirit into clay,

   And made man a living soul.


   Hallelujah, praise the One

   God o'er all, the first, the last:

   For He spake, and it was done;

   He commanded, it stood fast.

   The Glory of God in Creation.


   The God of nature and of grace

   In all His works appears;

   His goodness through the earth we trace,

   His grandeur in the spheres.


   Behold this fair and fertile globe

   By Him in wisdom plann'd;

   'Twas He who girded, like a robe,

   The ocean round the land.


   Lift to the arch of heaven your eye

   Thither His path pursue;

   His glory, boundless as the sky,

   O'erwhelms the wondering view.


   How excellent, O Lord, Thy name

   In all creation's lines!

   Spread through eternity, Thy fame

   With rising lustre shines.


   These lower works, that swell Thy praise

   High as man's thoughts can tower,

   Are but a portion of Thy ways,

   The hiding of Thy power.


   O shouldst Thou rend aside the veil,

   And show thy dwelling-place,

   The souls which thou hast made would fail

   'Twere death to see Thy face.


   Can none behold that face and live?

   Yea, sinners may draw near:

   The Lord is kind, and will forgive,

   His love shall cast out fear.


   Millions amidst His presence stand,

   Who feel, while they adore,

   Fulness of joy at His right hand,

   And pleasures evermore.

   By whose will, whose word, all things

   Are, and were, and yet shall be.


   Hail Him, all that move and breathe,

   On His throne of Providence;

   To His family beneath,

   Life and health diffusing thence.


   Hail Him on His throne of grace,

   God our Father reconciled,

   Changing, from our fallen race,

   Many a foe into a child.


   Hail Him on His throne of light,

   O'er His family above,

   From the beatific sight,

   Sending peace, and joy, and love.


   Hail, all hail, the King of kings,

   When on earth He deigns to dwell,

   Heaven into the soul He brings,

   God with us, Immanuel.


   Come, O come! and for Thy throne,

   King of kings, each heart prepare;

   Reign triumphant, reign alone,

   Lord of lords, for ever there.

HYMN VI.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   The Guilt and Folly of denying God.


   "There is a God," all Nature cries,

   All Knowledge proves "there is a God:"

   "There is no God," the Fool replies,

   Whose heart is duller than the clod.


   The grateful clod, refresh'd with rains,

   Pours flowers along its Maker's path;

   But the Fool's heart a Fool's remains,

   Untouch'd by love, unmoved by wrath.


   And yet the wretch himself deceives;

   While fiends believe, and trembling fly,

   He trembles though he disbelieves;

   And conscience gives his life the lie.


   Can guilt, can madness further go?

   Yes, his who God in works denies,

   Whose creed saith "Yes," whose life says "No:"

   Am I more holy, just, and wise?


   My soul, sink down in shame and grief;

   So fair without, so foul within;

   Thy faith is specious unbelief,

   Thy righteousness, self-righteous sin.


   O God! Thou art, Thou surely art,

   And those who truly seek Thee find;

   Put Thou Thy laws into my heart,

   In mercy write them on my mind.


   Light in Thy light I long to see,

   Thy glory in Thy goodness trace;

   Ah! then reveal Thy Son in me,

   Through faith may I be saved by grace.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   The Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.


   The glorious universe around,

   The heavens with all their train,

   Sun, moon, and stars, are firmly bound,

   In one mysterious chain.


   The earth, the ocean, and the sky,

   To form one world agree,

   Where all that walk, or swim, or fly,

   Compose one family.


   God in creation thus displays

   His wisdom and His might,

   While all His works with all His ways

   Harmoniously unite.


   In one fraternal bond of love,

   One fellowship of mind,

   The saints below, and saints above,

   Their bliss and glory find.


   Here, in their house of pilgrimage,

   Thy statutes are their song;

   There, through one bright eternal age,

   Thy praises they prolong.


   Lord, may our union form a part

   Of that thrice happy whole,

   Derive its pulse from Thee the Heart,

   Its life from Thee the Soul.

HYMN VIII.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   The Soul.


   What is the thing of greatest price,

   The whole creation round?

   That, which was lost in Paradise,

   That, which in Christ is found.


   The soul of man,--Jehovah's breath!

   That keeps two worlds at strife;

   Hell moves beneath to work its death,

   Heaven stoops to give it life.


   God, to reclaim it, did not spare

   His well-beloved Son;

   Jesus, to save it, deign'd to bear

   The Sins of all in One.


   The Holy Spirit sealed the plan,

   And pledged the blood divine,

   To ransom every soul of man;

   That price was paid for mine.


   And is this treasure borne below

   In earthly vessels frail;

   Can none its utmost value know,

   Till flesh and spirit fail?


   Then let us gather round the Cross,

   This knowledge to obtain,

   Not by the soul's eternal loss,

   But everlasting gain.

   The Temple of the Soul.


   Thus saith the high and lofty One,

   Inhabiting eternity;

   Earth is My footstool, Heaven My throne,

   What temple will ye build for Me?

   Restore Me now Mine own.


   Behold the temple of My choice;

   My dwelling is the humble soul;

   To make the broken heart rejoice,

   The wounded spirit to make whole;

   Then hearken to My voice.


   Here, O Thou high and lofty One,

   Bow down Thine heavens to dwell with me;

   Here plant Thy footstool, raise Thy throne,

   Rebuild Thy fallen sanctuary;

   I yield Thee back Thine own.


   Behold the temple of Thy choice,

   Eternity within my soul;

   Now make the broken heart rejoice,

   The wounded spirit now make whole;

   Lord! I have heard Thy voice.

HYMN X.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   The Earth full of the Goodness of God.


   God, in the high and holy place,

   Looks down upon the spheres;

   Yet in His providence and grace

   To every eye appears.


   He bows the heavens; the mountains stand,

   A highway for our God;

   He walks amidst the desert-sand,

   'Tis Eden where He trod


   The forests in His strength rejoice;

   Hark! on the evening breeze,

   As once of old, the Lord God's voice

   Is heard among the trees.


   Here, on the hills, He feeds His herds,

   His flocks on yonder plains;

   His praise is warbled by the birds,

   O could we catch their strains!


   Mount with the lark, and bear our song

   Up to the gates of light;

   Or, with the nightingale, prolong

   Our numbers through the night!


   In every stream His bounty flows,

   Diffusing joy and wealth;

   In every breeze His Spirit blows

   The breath of life and health.


   His blessings fall in plenteous showers

   Upon the lap of earth,

   That teems with foliage, fruits, and flowers,

   And rings with infant mirth.


   If God hath made this world so fair,

   Where sin and death abound;

   How beautiful, beyond compare,

   Will Paradise be found!

   James Montgomery

   The Sabbath.


   God the Creator bless'd

   The Sabbath of His rest;

   His six days' work had brought

   The universe from nought;

   The heavens and earth before Him stood,

   He saw them, and pronounced them good.


   God the Redeemer bless'd

   The Sabbath of His rest,

   When, all His sufferings done,

   The Cross's victory won,

   In Joseph's sepulchre He lay,

   And rested on the Sabbath Day.


   And God the Spirit bless'd

   The Christian Day of rest,

   Where (met with one accord)

   The servants of the Lord,

   To whom the Father's promise came,

   Like rushing wind and living flame.


   The Church below hath bless'd

   Her own sweet Day of rest,

   When, in her spousal dress

   Of blood-bought righteousness,

   Her happy spirit can rejoice

   To hear her heavenly Bridegroom's voice.


   They love the Sabbath Day,

   Who love to sing and pray;

   The Day of rest they love,

   Who seek their rest above;

   They love the Day of God in seven,

   Who prize an antepast of heaven.


   My God, the Day is Thine;

   O may I make it mine!

   By hallowing it to Thee,

   'Tis hallow'd twice to me;

   And when with Thee my heart is right,

   I call it holy--a delight.

   Universal Worship.--Ps. cxlviii.


   Heralds of creation! cry,--

   Praise the Lord, the Lord most high!

   Heaven and earth! obey the call,

   Praise the Lord, the Lord of all.


   For He spake, and forth from night

   Sprang the universe to light:

   He commanded,--Nature heard,

   And stood fast upon his word.


   Praise Him, all ye hosts above,

   Spirits perfected in love;

   Sun and Moon! your voices raise,

   Sing, ye stars! your Maker's praise.


   Earth! from all thy depths below,

   Ocean's hallelujahs flow,

   Lightning, Vapour, Wind and Storm,

   Hail and Snow! His will perform.


   Vales and Mountains! burst in song;

   Rivers! roll his praise along;

   Clap your hands, ye Trees! and hail

   God, who comes in every gale.


   Birds! on wings of rapture soar,

   Warble at His Temple door,

   Joyful sounds from Herds and Flocks,

   Echo back, ye Caves and Rocks!


   Kings! your Sovereign serve with awe;

   Judges! own His righteous law;

   Princes! worship Him with fear;

   Bow the knee, all People! here.


   Let His truth by Babes be told,

   And His wonders by the old;

   Youths and maidens! in your prime,

   Learn the lays of heaven betime.


   High above all height His throne,

   Excellent His name alone;

   Him let all His works confess,

   Him let every Being bless.

HYMN XIII.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   The various Lots of Man in Life.


   One human pair, and only one,

   Were form'd in youthful prime,

   All else that e'er beheld the sun,

   Were children in their time.


   For each a mother's pangs were borne,

   And many a father's eye

   Wept o'er his infant born to mourn,

   His infant born to die.


   With millions life was but a spark,

   Extinct as soon as fired;

   Others, just glancing from the dark,

   Wept, smiled, look'd round, retired.


   Millions and millions more have pass'd

   Life's various pilgrimage,

   While Death at all his arrows cast,

   And slew of every age.


   Of these what multitudes untold

   Have never known their God,

   But blind, and ignorant, and bold,

   In paths of ruin trod.


   What guiltier multitudes have known,

   Yet scorn'd Him or denied,

   Lived to themselves and sin alone;

   And as they lived they died.


   We may not wander like the first;

   Then, lest we share the lot

   Of those more awfully accurst,

   Who knew, but loved, Him not,--


   May we hold fast the faithful word,

   Our future time redeem,

   Live, while we live, unto the Lord,

   Die, when we die, to Him.

HYMN XIV.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   Man's Fall and Restoration.


   The days of Paradise were few,

   Man lived not long in innocence;

   He sinn'd, and sin his offspring slew,

   Death pass'd on all for his offence.


   Adam survives throughout his race,

   We do our father's deeds by choice;

   Like him, we shun our Maker's face,

   And tremble at our Judge's voice.


   Yet is our Maker still our Friend;

   Man yet may meet his Judge with joy;

   God, in our nature, did not send

   His Son to punish and destoy.


   He sent Him forth to seek and save

   The lost, the dying, and the dead,

   Cancel the curse, despoil the grave,

   And bruise for ever Satan's head.


   Thou, who thy Son to us didst give,

   That none who trust in Him should die;

   Give us to Him that we may live;--

   To His atoning blood we fly.


   Behold His sacrifice of love,

   So freely offer'd in our stead;

   Behold Him at the throne above,

   And save the souls for whom He bled.

   The Heavens declare the Glory of God.--Ps. xix.


   Thy glory, Lord, the heavens declare,

   The firmament displays Thy skill;

   The changing clouds, the viewless air,

   Tempest and calm Thy word fulfil;

   Day unto day doth utter speech,

   And night to night Thy knowledge teach.


   Though voice nor sound inform the ear,

   Well-known the language of their song,

   When one by one the stars appear,

   Led by the silent moon along,

   Till round the earth, from all the sky,

   Thy beauty beams on every eye.


   Waked by Thy touch, the shining sun

   Comes like a bridegroom from his bower,

   And, like a giant, glad to run

   His bright career with speed and power--

   Thy flaming messenger, to dart

   Life through the depth of Nature's heart.


   While these transporting visions shine

   Along the path of Providence,

   Glory eternal, joy divine,

   Thy word reveals, transcending sense;

   My soul Thy goodness longs to see,

   Thy love to man, Thy love to me.

   The Curse and the Blessing.


   To Adam thus Jehovah spake--

   "The ground is cursed for thy sake;

   Thence eat thy bread, and there once more

   Become the dust thou wert before."


   "Serpent," again Jehovah said,

   "The woman's seed shall bruise thy head,

   Yet in the strife thy fury feel,

   For thou shalt turn and wound his heel."


   He comes;--we hail His glorious birth,

   Who brings the blessing back to earth;

   Nor Eden only, but the Tree

   Of Life and immortality.

   The Names and Offices of Christ.


   Bright and joyful is the morn,

   From the highest realms of heaven

   Unto us a Son is given,


   On His shoulder He shall bear

   Power and majesty, and wear

   On His vesture and His thigh

   Names most awful, names most high.


   Wonderful in counsel, He,

   The incarnate Deity,

   Sire of ages ne'er to cease,

   King of kings, and Prince of Peace.


   Come and worship at His feet,

   Yield to Christ the homage meet;

   From His manger to His throne,

   Homage due to God alone.

   The Spirit creating all Things New.


   Spirit of power and might, behold

   A world by sin destroy'd,

   Creator-Spirit, as of old,

   Move on the formless void.


   Give Thou the word:--that healing sound

   Shall quell the deadly strife,

   And earth again, like Eden crown'd,

   Produce the Tree of Life.


   If sang the morning stars for joy,

   When nature rose to view,

   What strains will angel-harps employ,

   When Thou shalt all renew!


   And if the sons of God rejoice

   To hear a Saviour's name,

   How will the ransom'd raise their voice,

   To whom that Saviour came!


   So every kindred, tongue, and tribe,

   Assembling round the throne,

   Thy new creation shall ascribe

   To sovereign love alone.

HYMN XIX.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   The Flood.


   In vain the preacher cried, "Repent;

   Flee from impending wrath;"

   Headlong the world of rebels went

   Along its own broad path.


   They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold,

   Built, planted, till the day

   When the flood came, and young and old

   Were swept at once away.


   A few that fear'd the warning word

   Escaped the doom of sin;

   The ark received them, and the Lord

   Shut safe His servants in.


   The tide of time that knows no turn,

   Like that ingulfing flood,

   Whelms with destruction those that spurn

   God's truth and Jesus' blood.


   But still his preachers cry, "Repent;

   Flee from sin's deadly doom;"

   Forth from the ark this call is sent,

   "Come in, there yet is room."


   Unshut the door, where Mercy stands,

   The perishing to save,

   With earnest eye, and outstretch'd hands,

   From death beyond the grave.
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN XX.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   Escape from the Deluge of Old.


   A world of sinners once was drown'd,

   A deluge swept them all away;

   One family alone had found

   Mercy in that great Judgment Day.


   Forewarn'd of wrath to come, they fear'd,

   And, taught by God, prepared an ark,

   Which o'er the waves in sunshine steer'd,

   Where all below was dead and dark.


   Again the Spirit of the Lord

   Moved on the formless deep and void,

   And to the Patriarchs sight restored

   The relics of that world destroyed:


   A world without a breathing soul,

   Or sign of life in plant or tree;

   Stretch'd like a corpse from pole to pole,

   Untravell'd land, unvoyaged sea!


   Then from their hiding place they came,

   And straightway built an altar there;

   Whence rose to heaven the double flame

   Of pure burnt sacrifice and prayer.


   We, in an ark not made with hands,

   God's own new covenant of peace,

   Which on the rock of ages stands,

   Seek refuge till his anger cease.


   Then, as the cloud-born rainbow smiled

   On Noah's ransom'd ones, we trace

   Our heavenly Father reconciled

   In our incarnate Saviour's face.

HYMN XXI.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   The Building of another Tower than Babel.


   When men once more were multiplied,

   In language and in heart the same,

   "Come, let us build a tower," they cried,

   "To heaven, and get ourselves a name."


   The Lord came down to see their boast,

   Troubled their speech, perplex'd their hands,

   And drove the panic-smitten host

   From Shinar's plains through unknown lands.


   A tower and temple more sublime,

   Whose top, indeed, to heaven shall reach,

   Is raised,--that men of every clime

   Again may have one heart, one speech.


   As varying instruments accord

   To form the sweetest minstrelsy,

   All hearts, as one, may love the Lord,

   All tongues, as one, in praise agree.


   Thus, till the head-stone be brought forth,

   To build that tower the saints unite;

   And to the work, from south to north,

   From east to west, all tribes invite.


   Let young and old, as duty calls,

   Help to erect God's House of Prayer;

   Till He hath gather'd in its walls

   Earth's scatter'd tribes, to bless them there.

   Redeeming, restoring, and blessing our race,

   When fallen, condemn'd, and undone.


   Thy kindness, long-suffering and mercy to crown,

   The heirs of salvation to seal,

   From lonely woes that wring thy breast,

   The world's allurements,--Satan's snares.


   Return unto thy rest, my soul,

   From all the wanderings of thy thought,

   From sickness unto death made whole,

   Safe through a thousand perils brought.


   Then to thy rest, my soul, return

   From passions every hour at strife;

   Sin's works, and ways, and wages spurn,

   Though heaven and earth shall pass away,

   These words of prophecy are sure,

   Unchangeable amidst decay,

   Whoe'er to these shall add alloy,

   Them and their works will God destroy;

   His arm shall be His truth's defence.

   James Montgomery

   The Bible a Light to the Christian's Feet


   What is the World?--a wildering maze,

   Where sin hath track'd ten thousand ways,

   Her victims to ensnare;

   All broad, and winding, and aslope,

   All tempting with perfidious hope,

   All ending in despair.


   Millions of pilgrims throng those roads,

   Bearing their baubles or their loads,

   Down to eternal night;

   --One only path that never bends,

   Narrow, and rough, and steep, ascends

   From darkness into light.


   Is there no guide to show that path?

   The Bible!--He alone who hath

   The Bible need not stray;

   But He who hath, and will not give

   That light of life to all that live,

   Himself shall lose the way.

   The Law and the Testimonies.--Ps. xix.


   Thy law is perfect, Lord of light!

   Thy testimonies sure,

   The statutes of Thy realm are right,

   And thy commandments pure.


   Holy, inviolate Thy fear,

   Enduring as Thy throne:

   Thy judgments, chastening or severe,

   Justice and truth alone:--


   More prized than gold,--than gold whose waste

   Refining fire expels;

   Sweeter than honey to my taste,

   Than honey from the cells.


   Let these, O God! my soul convert;

   And make Thy servant wise;

   Let these be gladness to my heart,

   The day-spring to mine eyes.


   By these may I be warn'd betimes;

   Who knows the guilt within?

   Lord, save me from presumptuous crimes,

   Cleanse me from secret sin!


   So may the words my lips express,

   The thoughts that throng my mind,

   O Lord, my strength and righteousness!

   With Thee acceptance find.

   The Word of God, the Word of truth,

   Instruct our childhood, guide our youth,

   Uphold us through life's middle stage,

   And be our comfort in old age!


   'Twas by that Word the heavens were made,

   By it the earth's foundations laid;

   All things that are on it depend,

   Their source and stay, their rule and end.


   By it Jehovah gave His law,

   Midst sounds of terror, sights of awe;

   By it the holy men of old

   A better covenant foretold.


   Christ Jesus came, Himself "the Word;"

   His voice the powers of nature heard,

   In servant's form, they knew His call,

   The Son of God, the Lord of all.


   The Word of mercy which He brought,

   The Word of wisdom which He taught,

   His Word of grace, so full, so free,

   Our hope, our joy, our portion be.


   That Word, if early doom'd to death,

   Revive us at our latest breath,

   And when our souls in judgment stand,

   Decree our place at God's right hand.

   The invitation of Wisdom.--Prov. viii.


   To us the voice of Wisdom cries,

   Hearken, ye children, and be wise;

   Better than gold the fruit I bear,

   Rubies to me may not compare,


   Happy the man who daily waits

   To hear me, watching at my gates;

   Wretched is he who scorns my voice,

   Death and destruction are his choice.


   To them that love me I am kind;

   And those who seek me early find;

   My Son, give me thine heart,--and learn

   Wisdom from folly to discern.


   The Lord possess'd me, ere of old,

   His hand the firmament unroll'd;

   Before He bade the mountains stand,

   Or pour'd the ocean round the land.


   Rejoicing then before his throne,

   From everlasting I was known;

   Rejoicing still, as in His sight,

   With men on earth is my delight.


   Mark, the beginning of my law,

   --Fear ye the Lord with sacred awe;

   Mark the fulfilment of the whole,

   Love ye the Lord with all your soul.


   We hear, we learn; may we obey;

   Jesus, the life, the truth, the way,

   Wisdom and righteousness, we see,

   Grace and salvation all in Thee.

   Thine eye is ever fix'd on me;

   I dwell beneath Thy secret throne,

   Encompass'd by Thy Deity.


   Throughout this universe of space,

   To nothing am I long allied,

   For flight of time and change of place,

   My strongest, dearest bonds divide.


   Parents I had, but where are they?

   Friends whom I knew, I know no more;

   Companions, once that cheer'd my way,

   Have dropp'd behind or gone before.


   Now I am one amidst a crowd

   Of life and action hurrying round;

   Now left alone,--for, like a cloud,

   They came, they went, and are not found.


   Even from myself sometimes I part:

   Unconscious sleep is nightly death,

   Yet surely by my couch Thou art,

   To prompt my pulse, inspire my breath.


   Of all that I have done and said,

   How little can I now recall:

   Forgotten things to me are dead;

   With Thee they live,--Thou know'st them all.


   Thou hast been with me from the womb,

   Witness to every conflict here;

   Nor wilt Thou leave me at the tomb,

   Before Thy bar I must appear.


   The moment comes-- the only one

   Of all my time to be foretold;

   Yet when, and how, and where, can none

   Among the race of man unfold:--


   The moment comes, when strength shall fail,

   When, (health and hope and courage flown)

   I must go down into the vale

   And shade of death with Thee alone.


   Alone with Thee!--in that dread strife

   Uphold me through mine agony,

   And gently be this dying life

   Exchanged for immortality.


   Then, when the unbodied spirit lands

   Where flesh and blood have never trod,

   And in the unveil'd presence stands,

   Of Thee, my Saviour and my God;--


   Be mine eternal portion this,

   Since Thou wert always here with me,

   --That I may view Thy face in bliss,

   And be for evermore with Thee.

   The Almightiness of God.--Mark, x. 27.


   With men impossible!

   What hope remains for me?

   A sinner on the verge of hell,

   How? whither? shall I flee?


   "Flee from the wrath to come,"

   I hear Jehovah say;

   What can I do--let doubt be dumb,--

   What can I--but obey?


   His sceptre or His rod,

   Who shall control them?--None:

   All things are possible with God,

   He speaks, and it is done.


   'Tis but to know His will,

   And in His power confide,

   Then faith may bid the sun stand still,

   Or walk upon the tide.


   The Lord can make a worm

   Almighty if He please,

   And at His single word perform

   Impossibilities.


   When to the blind man's eyes

   He saith "Behold!" 'tis so:

   And when He calls the dead, they rise,

   Though the grave's mouth cries "No!"


   Then, my Redeemer, then,

   From wrath to love I flee,

   The things impossible to men,

   Are possible with Thee.


   I, at Thy feet, in dust,

   My unbelief resign,

   In Thee alone is all my trust,

   Lord, save me, I am thine.

HYMN XXXII.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   All have sinned; all may be saved.


   A child of man, a child of God,

   How wide their states must be!

   Beneath His sceptre or His rod,

   His wrath or clemency.


   Children of Adam, Adam's fall

   From primal innocence,

   Brought guilt and judgment on us all,

   Entail'd through one offence.


   Train'd in His image from our birth,

   We sinn'd, ourselves, and fell,

   Like him, from heirs of heaven on earth,

   To heirs of death and hell.


   Transgressors while we thus remain,

   In our own blood we lie;

   We must be born, be born again,

   Or die, for ever die.


   A child of man, a child of God,

   How can such union be?

   A worm created from a clod,

   Allied to Deity!


   Lo! love divine, for man undone,

   Devised the wondrous plan,

   The Son of God, God's only Son,

   Became the Son of man.


   Our path of life and death He trod,

   That we like Him might be,

   Though sons of men, the sons of God,

   Through His humanity.


   All glory to the Father's love,

   Who spared not His Son,

   Aud sent His Spirit from above,

   To seal what Christ had done.

   James Montgomery

   Christ the Messiah manifested in his Advent and Offices.


   A child is born,--the birth proclaim,

   A son is given,--declare his name;

   Messiah, from the Fall foretold,

   The Deity in human mould;

   --That mould from which, God's image lost

   In Eden at so dire a cost,

   The new creation shall restore,

   And guilt efface its lines no more.


   Hail! to His rising from afar,

   He is the bright and morning star;

   His healing beams, ye nations, bless,

   He is the Sun of Righteousness

   To save His people from their sins,

   Jesus His suffering life begins;

   Ere long as Christ our sacrifice,

   The Holy and the Just One dies.


   Again His glorious name record,

   As David's Son and David's Lord;

   He mounts the mediatorial throne,

   To claim earth's kingdoms for his own:

   Him every eye again shall see

   Descend in power and majesty,

   His ransom'd in the clouds to meet,

   And put all foes beneath his feet.

   The Name above every Name.


   The Name, the Name o'er every name

   In earth or heaven above,

   Let babes' and sucklings' lips proclaim

   And youth adore and love.


   Jesus, the Son of God most high,

   Whose image he express'd,

   The fullness of the Deity,

   In flesh made manifest:--


   Jesus, the Son of Man became,

   Assumed our mortal breath,

   Endured the cross, despised the shame,

   And pour'd His soul in death.


   Jesus, omnipotent to save,

   Then triumph'd gloriously;

   O Death! where is thy sting? O Grave!

   Where is thy victory?


   Redemption in His blood begins,

   In His atonement ends;

   He saves His people from their sins;

   Who would not be His friends?


   To God the Father's glory, now,

   Jesus, Thy name we bless;

   Let every knee before it bow,

   And every tongue confess.

HYMN XXXV.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   Angels and Men.


   Angels, the firstborn sons of light,

   Since from their glorious seats they fell,

   Are outcasts in eternal night;

   There is no gospel preach'd in hell.


   Man, when beguiled from innocence,

   Saw death and judgment come on all;

   But Jesus died for his offence,

   To raise us higher than our fall.


   Angels, who kept their first estate,

   Who sinn'd not, knew not guilt or woe,

   In bliss beyond expression great,

   The bliss of pardon cannot know.


   We, born in sorrow and in sin,

   Yet by a new and living way

   To Paradise again brought in,--

   May taste of sweeter joys than they,


   Oh! through Eternity to trace

   How much, how much hath been forgiven,

   The riches of redeeming grace,

   That, that must be the heaven of heaven.


   Lord Jesus Christ, who, for our sake,

   Wert pleased a child like us to be,

   Of every soul possession take,

   And new-create us all like Thee.

   James Montgomery

   Vain Confidence and Self-deception.


   Let not the strong, the, rich, the wise,

   Of knowledge, wealth, or power be vain,

   What mortals covet most, most prize,

   When won, how few can long retain!

   Heaven's noblest gift may prove a snare,

   Unsanctified by faith and prayer.


   He slept on pleasure's lap, and woke

   Shorn of his strength Poor Samson found

   The Lord had left him, when he broke

   The vow with which his life was bound;

   Blind, chain'd, enslaved, returning strength

   Brought death with his revenge at length.


   The wily traitor was betray'd

   In his own craft; though woven well,

   The net which for his king he laid

   Entangled wise Achitophel;

   Folly o'erruled what wisdom plann'd,

   He perish'd by his own false hand.


   "Soul, take thine ease eat, drink, rejoice,

   Through length of years," the rich man said;

   "Thou fool! this night," replied the voice

   That calls the living to the dead,

   "Thy soul shall be required of thee,

   Whose then shall all thy treasures be?"


   Wise to salvation through His Word,

   And rich in faith His kingdom's heir,

   Strong in the strength of Christ my Lord;

   Be this my portion! 'tis my prayer:

   For this would I count all things loss,

   And glory only in the cross.

   For Guardianship through Life and Death.--Acts, xvii. 28.


   To Thee in whom we live and move,

   And have our being here,

   A higher, holier state to prove,

   Through Christ let us draw near.


   Though born in sin, to trouble born,

   Transgressors from the womb,

   Leave not thine offspring thus forlorn,

   In error, doubt, and gloom.


   Send out, good Lord, Thy light and truth,

   Through each advancing stage,

   To guard in childbood, guide in youth,

   And comfort us in age.


   Darkness for light may we not choose,

   For falsehood truth forego,

   Nor things that are eternal lose

   For vanities below.


   Teach us to number so our days,

   That we our hearts apply

   To walk in Wisdom's pleasant ways,

   In them to live and die.


   Living, prepared with every breath

   Our spirits to resign;

   Dying, lay hold on life in death,

   And so be ever Thine,

   Covenanting to serve the Lord.


   Come, ye that fear the Lord,

   And love Him while ye fear;

   Come, and with heart and hand record

   Your vow and covenant here.


   Vow to be His alone

   Who bought you with a price;

   Now render back to God His own,

   By free-will sacrifice.


   Here to His altar brought,

   Your covenant renew,

   To be in word, and deed, and thought,

   Faithful to Him and true.


   And true and faithful He

   To you will ever prove,

   Though hills were swept into the sea,

   And mountains should remove.


   Then be His law our choice,

   The joy of young and old,

   As sheep that hear their shepherd's voice,

   And follow to the fold.


   So shall His staff and rod

   Conduct us and defend:

   God is a covenant-keeping God,

   And loves unto the end.

   I will bless thee,--and thou shalt be a blessing."--Gen. xii. 2.


   Where'er the Patriarch pitch'd his tent,

   He built an altar to his God,

   And sanctified, where'er he went,

   With faith and prayer, the ground he trod.


   Through all the East, for riches famed,

   Heaven's gifts, he set his heart on none;

   Nor, when the dearest was reclaim'd,

   Withheld his son, his only son.


   Wherefore, in blessing, he was blest;

   Friendless, the friend of God became;

   Long-wandering, every where found rest;

   Long child-less, nations bear his name.


   Nor nations born of blood alone,

   The father of the faithful he;

   Where'er his promised seed is known,

   Faith's heirs are his posterity.


   My God, what Thou hast made my home,

   Let me Thy sanctuary make;

   My God, if call'd by Thee to roam,

   Glad may I all for Thee forsake.


   Thy law, Thy Love, be my delight,

   Whate'er I do, or think, or am,

   Walking by faith, and not by sight,

   Like a true child of Abraham.

   The Lord the Good Shepherd.--Ps. xxiii.


   The Lord is my Shepherd, nor want shall I know;

   I feed in green pastures, safe-folded I rest;

   He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,

   Restores me when wandering, redeems when opprest.


   Through the valley and shadow of death though I stray,

   Since Thou art my guardian no evil I fear;

   Thy rod shall defend me, Thy staff be my stay;

   No harm can befall, with my Comforter near.


   In the midst of affliction my table is spread;

   With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o'er;

   With perfume and oil, Thou anointest my head;

   O! what shall I ask of Thy Providence more?


   Let goodness and mercy, my bountiful God!

   Still follow my steps, till I meet Thee above:

   I seek, by the path which my forefathers trod

   Through the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love.

   The Majesty of God.--Ps. xcii.


   The Lord is King:--upon His throne,

   He sits in garments glorious:

   Or girds for war His armour on,

   In every field victorious:

   The world came forth at his command;

   Built on His word its pillars stand;

   They never can be shaken.


   The Lord was King ere time began,

   His reign is everlasting:

   When high the floods in tumult ran,

   Their foam to heaven up-casting,

   He made the raging waves His path;

   The sea is mighty in its wrath,

   But God on high is mightier.


   Thy testimonies, Lord, are sure;

   Thy realm fears no commotion;

   Firm as the earth, whose shores endure

   The eternal toil of ocean:

   And Thou with perfect peace wilt bless

   Thy faithful flock;--for holiness

   Becomes Thine house for ever.

   God Omnipresent and Omniscient--Ps. cxxxix.


   Searcher of hearts! to Thee are known

   The inmost secrets of my breast

   At home, abroad, in crowds, alone,

   Thou mark'st my rising and my rest,

   My thoughts far off, through every maze,

   Source, stream, and issue,--all my ways.


   How from Thy presence should I go,

   Or whither from Thy Spirit flee,

   Since all above, around, below,

   Exist in Thine immensity?

   If up to heaven I take my way,

   I meet Thee in eternal day.


   If in the grave I make my bed

   With worms and dust, lo! Thou art there;

   If, on the wings of morning sped,

   Beyond the ocean I repair,

   I feel Thine all-controlling will,

   And Thy right hand upholds me still.


   "Let darkness hide me," If I say,

   Darkness can no concealment be;

   Night on Thy rising shines like day;

   Darkness and light are one with Thee:

   For Thou mine embryo-form didst view,

   Ere her own babe my mother knew.


   In me Thy workmanship display'd,

   A miracle of power I stand,

   Fearfully, wonderfully made,

   And framed in secret by Thine hand:

   I lived, ere into being brought,

   Through Thine eternity of thought.


   How precious are Thy thoughts of peace,

   O God, to me! how great the sum!

   New every morn, they never cease;

   They were, they are, and yet shall come,

   In number and in compass more

   Than ocean's sands or ocean's shore.


   Search me, O God! and know my heart;

   Try me, my inmost soul survey;

   And warn Thy servant to depart

   From every false and evil way;

   So shall Thy truth my guidance be

   To life and immortality.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   The Christian Soldier.


   The Christian warrior,--see him stand

   In the whole armour of his God:

   The Spirit's sword is in his hand;

   His feet are with the gospel shod;


   In panoply of truth complete,

   Salvation's helmet on his head:

   With righteousness, a breastplate meet;

   And faith's broad shield before him spread.


   He wrestles not with flesh and blood,

   But principalities and powers,

   Rulers of darkness, like a flood,

   Nigh, and assailing at all hours.


   Nor Satan's fiery darts alone,

   Quench'd on his shield, at him are hurl'd;

   The traitor in his heart is known,

   And the dire friendship of this world.


   Undaunted to the field he goes;

   Yet vain were skill and valour there,

   Unless, to foil his legion-foes,

   The trustiest weapon were "all-prayer."


   With this omnipotence he moves,

   From this the alien armies flee,

   Till more than conqueror he proves,

   Through Christ who gives him victory.


   Thus, strong in his Redeemer's strength,

   Sin, death, and hell, he tramples down,

   Fights the good fight, and wins at length,

   Through mercy, an immortal crown.

   The peaceful Summons of Salvation opposed to the Sounds of
   War.--(Anniversary.)


   Not by the brazen trumpet's voice,

   But the sweet sky-lark's early lay,

   Our tribes are summoned, to rejoice

   In God their Saviour on this day.


   Not to the battle-field we throng

   With deadly steel in murderous hands,

   But on our hill of peace the song

   Of triumph bursts from all our bands.


   Then, in the temples of the Lord,

   Assembling round a throne of grace

   We sing, and pray, and hear the word,

   And meet our Maker face to face.


   Salvation's silver trumpet brings

   Heaven's richest music to our ears;

   Happy, whose heart with rapture springs,

   At the first welcome note he hears.


   He, when the last dread trumpet's tone

   The dead to second life shall call,

   May stand unmoved before the throne,

   Though stars, like lightnings, round him fall.


   He, where eternal sabbaths shine,

   Where all by God himself are taught,

   Lessons shall learn of truth divine,

   Of power and love, surpassing thought.

   God's great Deliverance of His People.--Ps. cvii.


   part I.--The Wilderness.

      Thank and praise Jehovah's name

      For his mercies firm and sure,

      From eternity the same,

      To eternity endure.


      Let the ransom'd thus rejoice,

      Gather'd out of every land;

      As the people of his choice,

      Pluck'd from the destroyer's hand.


      In the wilderness astray,

      Hither, thither, while they roam,

      Hungry, fainting by the way,

      Far from refuge, shelter, home;


      Then unto the Lord they cry;

      He inclines a gracious ear,

      Sends deliverance from on high,

      Rescues them from all their fear.


      To a pleasant land He brings,

      Where the vine and olive grow,

      Where from flowery hills the springs

      Through luxuriant valleys flow.


      O that men would praise the Lord,

      For His goodness to their race;

      For the wonders of His word,

      And the riches of His grace!


   part II.--From Captivity.

      They that mourn in dungeon-gloom,

      Bound in iron and despair,

      Sentenced to a heavier doom

      Than the pangs they suffer there;--


      Foes and rebels once to God,

      They disdain'd His high control;

      Now they feel His fiery rod,

      Striking terrors through their soul.


      Wrung with agony, they fall

      To the dust, and, gazing round,

      Call for help;--in vain they call;

      Help, nor hope, nor friend are found.


      Then unto the Lord they cry;

      He inclines a gracious ear,

      Sends deliverance from on high,

      Rescues them from all their fear.


      He restores their forfeit breath,

      Breaks in twain the gates of brass;

      From the bands and grasp of death,

      Forth to liberty they pass.


      O that men would praise the Lord,

      For his goodness to their race,

      For the wonders of His word,

      And the riches of His grace!


   part III. From Malignant Disease.

      Sinners, for transgression, see

      Sharp disease their youth consume,

      And their beauty, like a tree,

      Withering on an early tomb.


      Food is loathsome to their taste,

      And the eye revolts from light;

      All their joys to ruin haste,

      As the sunset into night.


      Then unto the Lord they cry;

      He inclines a gracious ear,

      Sends deliverance from on high,

      Rescues them from all their fear.


      He with health renews their frame,

      Lengthens out their number'd days,

      Let them glorify His name

      With the sacrifice of praise.


      O that men would praise the Lord,

      For his goodness to their race,

      For the wonders of His word,

      And the riches of His grace!


   part IV. Perils on the Deep.

      They that toil upon the deep,

      And, in vessels light and frail,

      O'er the mighty waters sweep,

      With the billow and the gale,--


      Mark what wonders God performs,

      When He speaks, and, unconfined,

      Rush to battle all His storms,

      In the chariots of the wind.


      Up to heaven their bark is whirl'd

      On the mountain of the wave,

      Down as suddenly 'tis hurl'd

      To th' abysses of the grave.


      To and fro they reel and roll,

      As intoxicate with wine;

      Terrors paralyze their soul,

      Helm they quit, and hope resign.


      Then unto the Lord they cry;

      He inclines a gracious ear,

      Sends deliverance from on high,

      Rescues them from all their fear.


      Calm and smooth the surges flow,

      And where deadly lightning ran,

      God's own reconciling bow

      Metes the ocean with a span.


      O that men would praise the Lord,

      For His goodness to their race,

      For the wonders of His word,

      And the riches of His grace!

   Time past, Time Passing, Time to come.--Ps xc.


   Lord, Thou hast been Thy people's rest,

   Through all their generations;

   Their refuge when by troubles prest,

   Their hope in tribulations:

   Thou, ere the mountains sprang to birth,

   Or ever Thou hadst form'd the earth,

   Art God from everlasting.


   Our life is like the transient breath,

   That tells a mournful story;

   Early or late, stopt short by death;--

   And where is all our glory?

   Our days are threescore years and ten,

   And if the span be lengthened then,

   Their strength is toil and sorrow.


   Lo Thou hast set before Thine eyes

   All our misdeeds and errors;

   Our secret sins from darkness rise

   At Thine awakening terrors:

   Who shall abide the trying hour?

   Who knows the thunder of Thy power?

   We flee unto Thy mercy.


   Lord, teach us so to mark our days,

   That we may prize them duly;

   So guide our feet in Wisdom's ways,

   That we may love Thee truly:

   Return, O Lord! our griefs behold,

   And with Thy goodness, as of old,

   O satisfy us early.

   O my soul! with all thy powers,

   Bless the Lord's most holy name;

   O my soul! till life's last hours,

   Bless the Lord, His praise proclaim;

   Thine infirmities He heal'd,

   He thy peace and pardon seal'd.


   He with loving-kindness crown'd thee,

   Satisfied thy mouth with good,

   From the snares of death unbound thee,

   Eagle-like thy youth renew'd:

   Rich in tender mercy He,

   Slow to wrath, to favour free.


   He will not retain displeasure,

   Though awhile He hide His face,

   Nor His God-like bounty measure

   By our merit, but His grace:

   As the heaven the earth transcends,

   Over us His care extends.


   Far as east and west are parted,

   He our sins hath sever'd thus;

   As a father, loving-hearted,

   Spares his son, He spareth us;

   For He knows our feeble frame.

   He remembers whence we came.


   From eternity enduring,

   To eternity, the Lord,

   Still His people's bliss insuring,

   Keeps His covenanted word:

   Yea, with truth and righteousness,

   Children's children He will bless.


   As in heaven, His throne and dwelling,

   King on earth He holds His sway;

   Angels! ye in strength excelling,

   Bless the Lord, His voice obey:

   All His works beneath the pole

   Bless the Lord, with thee, my soul!

   James Montgomery

   Moses in the Desert.


   Go where a foot hath never trod,

   Through unfrequented forests flee;

   The wilderness is full of God,

   His presence dwells in every tree.


   To Israel and to Egypt dead,

   Moses the fugitive appears;

   Unknown he lived, till o'er his head

   Had fall'n the snow of fourscore years.


   But God the wandering exile found,

   In His appointed time and place;

   The desert sand grew holy ground,

   And Horeb's rock a throne of grace.


   The lonely bush a tree became,

   A tree of beauty and of light!

   Involved with unconsuming flame,

   That made the moon around it night.


   Then came, the Eternal Voice that spake

   Salvation to the chosen seed;

   Thence went the Almighty arm that brake

   Proud Pharoah's yoke, and Israel freed.


   By Moses, old and slow of speech,

   These mighty miracles were shown;

   Jehovah's messenger! to teach

   That power belongs to God alone.

HYMN XLIX.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   The Death of Moses.


   He climb'd the mountain; and behold!

   The land before him lay;

   Here Jordan's bounding waters roll'd,

   There Carmel stretch'd away.


   From northern Lebanon, outspread,

   To Araby the wild,

   Where strangers' lives the Patriarchs led,

   Their promised Canaan smiled:


   A land of fountains and of rills,

   Pure milk and honey flow'd;

   Whose stones were iron; from whose hills

   Brass in the furnace glow'd:


   A land of corn, and wine, and oil,

   Whose trees with fruitage hung,

   While birds, to soothe the labourers' toil,

   Amid the branches sung.


   Valleys stood thick with golden grain,

   Goats bounded on the rocks,

   And white and dark, on slope and plain,

   Roam'd pasturing herds and flocks.


   But all the soil with blood was stain'd,

   Revenge and rapine strove;

   Pagan abominations reign'd

   In every haunted grove.


   From cities populous and proud

   The shrieks of children came,

   Where drums and cymbals led the crowd,

   Round Moloch's altar-flame.


   The Vision changed;--then Moses saw

   The Idols overthrown,

   God out of Zion giving law,

   God worship'd there alone.


   And still the vision grew more bright;

   On humble Bethlehem shined

   The star of Jacob, and a light

   To lighten all mankind,


   In silent trance the prophet gazed:

   "It is enough," he cried;

   His hands with holy rapture raised,

   Saw the Lord's Christ, and died.


   His spirit return'd to God who gave:

   His body, nowhere found,

   Shall keep the secret of its grave

   Till the last trumpet sound.

   The Three Mountains.


   When on Sinai's top I see

   God descend in Majesty,

   To proclaim His holy law,

   All my spirit sinks with awe.


   When, in ecstasy sublime,

   Tabor's glorious steep I climb,

   At the too-transporting light,

   Darkness rushes 'o'er my sight.


   When on Calvary I rest,

   God, in flesh made manifest,

   Shines in my Redeemer's face,

   Full of beauty, truth, and grace.


   Here I would for ever stay,

   Weep and gaze my soul away;

   Thou art heaven on earth to me,

   Lovely, mournful Calvary.

   James Montgomery

   Choosing the Heritage of God's People.


   People of the living God,

   I have sought the world around,

   Paths of sin and sorrow trod,

   Peace and comfort nowhere found.

   Now to you my spirit turns,

   Turns, a fugitive unbless'd;

   Brethren, where your altar burns,

   O receive me into rest!


   Lonely I no longer roam,

   Like the cloud, the wind, the wave;

   Where you dwell shall be my home,

   Where you die shall be my grave;

   Mine the God whom you adore,

   Your Redeemer shall be mine;

   Earth can fill my heart no more,

   Every idol I resign.


   Tell me not of gain or loss,

   Ease, enjoyment, pomp, and power,

   Welcome poverty and cross,

   Shame, reproach, affliction's hour:

   "Follow me!"--I know the voice;

   Jesus, Lord, Thy steps I see;

   Now I take Thy yoke by choice,

   Light Thy burden now to me.

   A Visit to Bethlehem in Spirit.


   The scene arround me disappears,

   And, borne to ancient regions,

   While Time recals the flight of years,

   I see angelic legions

   Descending in an orb of light,

   Amidst the dark and silent night;

   I hear celestial voices.


   "Tidings, glad tidings from above

   To every age and nation;

   Tidings, glad tidings,--God is love,

   To man He sends salvation:

   His Son beloved, His only Son,

   The work of mercy hath begun;

   Give to his name the glory."


   Through David's city I am led;

   Here all around are sleeping;

   A light directs to yon poor shed,

   There lonely watch is keeping:

   I enter;--ah! what glories shine!

   Is this Immanuel's earthly shrine?

   Messiah's infant temple?


   It is, it is; and I adore

   This Stranger meek and lowly,

   As saints and seraphs bow before

   The throne of God thrice holy:

   Faith through the veil of flesh can see

   The face of thy Divinity,

   My Lord, my God, my Saviour!

   James Montgomery

   The Three Marys.


   Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

      Like Mary, when the angel came

      To hail her from on high;

      When God's Messengers proclaim

      Glad tidings, would reply,--

      "Behold the handmaid of the Lord,

      Be it according to Thy word."

      Come, Holy Ghost, Thy power impart,

      Form Christ in every heart.


   Mary, the Sister of Lazarus.

      Like Mary, placed at Jesus' feet,

      We hear His words with joy;

      Nor would we change our humble seat

      For Martha's hard employ.

      Now, too, like Mary, when she shed

      The precious spikenard on his head,

      Sweet fall our tears from grateful eyes,

      While prayers'like incense rise.


   Mary Magdalene.

      Like Mary at the Sepulchre,

      The risen Lord we seek:

      Jesus, reveal Thyself:--like her,

      Oh! might we hear Thee speak!

      Thy look, Thy voice, Thy love the same,

      Call each poor handmaid by her name,

      While, with full heart and kindling eye,

      All, all, "Rabboni!" cry.

   James Montgomery

   The Good Shepherd and His Flock.


   Green pastures and clear streams,

   Freedom and quiet rest,

   Christ's flock enjoy, beneath His beams,

   Or in His shadow rest.


   The mountain and the vale,

   Forest and field, they range;

   The morning dew, the evening gale,

   Bring health in every change.


   Secure amidst alarms,

   From violence or snares,

   The lambs He gathers in His arms,

   And in His bosom bears.


   The woumded and the weak

   He comforts, heals, and binds;

   The lost He came from heaven to seek,

   And saves them when He finds.


   Through wilds of brier and thorn,

   In darkness if they stray,

   They wander not like waifs forlorn;

   Their Shepherd is their way.


   Should storms of trouble blow,

   Warn'd of the coming shock,

   They to the Rock of Ages go;

   Their Shepherd is their Rock.


   Let earth and hell oppose,

   Let Satan take the field;

   Quench'd are the darts of all their foes;

   Their Shepherd is their shield.


   Death may assail; but death

   Is vanquish'd in the strife;

   The moment of departing breath,

   Begins eternal life.


   Conflicts and trials done,

   His glory they behold,

   Where Jesus and His flock are one,

   One Shepherd and one fold.


   When the last trump shall sound,

   And graves break up their sleep,

   At His right hand may we be found,

   Among the chosen sheep.

   James Montgomery

   The Christian Israel.


   Thus far on life's perplexing path,

   Thus far, Thou, Lord, our steps hast led;

   Snatch'd from the world's pursuing wrath,

   Unharm'd, though floods hung o'er our head;

   Like ransom'd Israel on the shore,

   Here, then, we pause, look back, adore.


   Strangers and pilgrims here below,

   Like all our fathers in their day,

   We to the land of promise go,

   Lord, by Thine own appointed way:

   Still guide, illumine, cheer our flight,

   In cloud by day, in fire by night.


   Safety Thy presence is, and rest;

   While,--as the eagle, o'er her brood

   Flutters her pinions, stirs the nest,

   Covers, defends, provides them food,

   Bears on her wings, instructs to fly,--

   Thy love prepares us for the sky.


   Protect us through the wilderness

   From fiery tempest, plague, and foe;

   With bread from heaven Thy people bless,

   And living streams where'er we go:

   Nor let our rebel hearts repine,

   Or follow any voice but Thine.


   Thy holy law to us proclaim,

   But not from Sinai's top alone;

   Hid in the rock-cleft, be Thy Name,

   Thy power and all Thy goodness shown;

   And may we never bow the knee,

   Or worship any God but Thee.


   When we have number'd all our years,

   And stand, at length, on Jordan's brink,

   Though the flesh fail with mortal fears,

   O let not then the spirit sink;

   But, strong in faith, and hope, and love,

   Plunge through the stream to rise above.

   The Waters of Life.--Numbers xxi.


   Spring up, O well! sweet fountain, spring!

   And fructify the desert sand;

   Sing ye that drink; the waters sing,

   They dance along the smiling land;

   With flowers adorn, with verdure bless,

   The waste and howling wilderness.


   Ho, every one that thirsts draw nigh,

   With sickness fainting, worn with toil;

   Let him that hath no money buy,

   Buy milk and honey, wine and oil,

   The fourfold streams of Paradise,

   Priceless, because above all price.


   Come to the pools, ye lame and blind;

   Ye lepers, to this Jordan come;

   Sight, strength, and healing each may find;

   Approach the waves, ye deaf and dumb;

   Their joyful sound ye soon shall hear,

   And your own voice delight your ear.


   In every form the waters run,

   Rill, river, torrent, lake, and sea;

   Through every clime beneath the sun,

   Free as the air, as daylight free,

   Till earth's whole face the floods o'erweep,

   As ocean's tides the channel'd deep.


   As moved with mighty wings outspread,

   God's Spirit o'er the formless void,

   So be that Spirit's influence shed

   To new-create a world destroy'd;

   Till all that died through Adam's fall

   Revive in Christ, who died for all.

   A Fountain opened for Sin and Uncleanness.


   Come to Calvary's holy mountain,

   Sinners ruin'd by the fall;

   Here a pure and healing fountain

   Flows to you, to me, to all,

   In a full, perpetual tide,

   Open'd when our Saviour died.


   Come in poverty and meanness,

   Come defiled, without, within;

   From infection and uncleanness,

   From the leprosy of sin,

   Wash your robes and make them white:

   Ye shall walk with God in light.


   Come, in sorrow and contrition,

   Wounded, impotent, and blind;

   Here the guilty free remission,

   Here the troubled peace may find;

   Health this fountain will restore,

   He that drinks shall thirst no more:--


   He that drinks shall live for ever;

   'Tis a soul-renewing flood:

   God is faithful;--God will never

   Break his covenant in blood,

   Sign'd when our Redeemer died,

   Seal'd when he was glorified.

HYMN LVIII.

   James Montgomery

   Christ's Mission.


   The world in condemnation lay,

   And death, from Adam reigning,

   O'er man maintain'd remorseless sway,

   While sin his soul enchaining,

   Foredoom'd the second death to all

   That shared the ruins of the fall;

   But Christ's triumphant mission

   Redeem'd us from perdition.


   Then round His manger let us throng,

   Attend Him in temptation,

   Carry our cross with joy along

   His path of tribulation;

   With Him to Olivet retire,

   On Calvary at His feet expire;

   Then, on Mount Zion seated,

   Our bliss shall be completed.

HYMN LIX.

   James Montgomery

   The Prince of Peace.


   When war on earth suspended

   His wild career of woes,

   The Prince of Peace descended,

   A guiltier strife to close:

   Vain battles worms were waging

   With their Creator God:

   He came, and wrath assuaging,

   Made peace with His own blood.


   The storm that flamed and lower'd,

   Was calm at His command;

   The rod of Justice flower'd,

   Like Aaron's, in His hand:

   That sceptre, love-revealing,

   Rebels approach and kiss;

   Its leaves are for your healing,

   Its fruits--immortal bliss.

   James Montgomery

   Christ our Example in Suffering.


   Go to dark Gethsemane,

   Ye that feel the tempter's power;

   Your Redeemer's conflict see,

   Watch with Him one bitter hour:

   Turn not from his griefs away,

   Learn of Jesus Christ to pray.


   Follow to the judgment-hall;

   View the Lord of Life arraign'd;

   O the wormwood and the gall!

   O the pangs His soul sustain'd!

   Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;

   Learn of Him to bear the cross.


   Calvary's mournful mountain climb,

   There, adoring at His feet,

   Mark that miracle of time,

   God's own sacrifice complete:

   It is finish'd;"--hear the cry;

   Learn of Jesus Christ to die.


   Early hasten to the tomb,

   Where they laid His breathless clay:

   All is solitude and gloom;

   Who hath taken Him away?

   Christ is risen!--He meets our eyes.

   Saviour, teach us so to rise.
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN LXI.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   Christ's Passion.


   The morning dawns upon the place

   Where Jesus spent the night in prayer;

   Through yielding glooms behold His face,

   Nor form nor comeliness is there.


   Last eve, by those He called His own,

   Betray'd, forsaken, or denied,

   He met His enemies alone

   In all their malice, rage, and pride.


   Brought forth to judgment, now He stands

   Arraign'd, condemn'd, at Pilate's bar:

   Here, spurn'd by fierce praetorian bands,

   There, mock'd by Herod's men of war.


   He bears their buffeting and scorn,

   Mock-homage of the lip and knee,

   The purple robe, the crown of thorn,

   The scourge, the nail, the accursed tree.


   No guile within His mouth is found,

   He neither threatens nor complains:

   Meek as a lamb for slaughter bound,

   Dumb 'midst His murderers He remains.


   But hark! He prays--tis for His foes;

   He speaks,--tis comfort to His friends;

   Answers,--and Paradise bestows;

   He bows His head; the conflict ends.


   Truly this was the Son of God!

   Though in a servant's mean disguise;

   And, bruised beneath the Father's rod,

   Not for Himself--for Man He dies.
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN LXII.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   What is Prayer?


   Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,

   Utter'd or unexpress'd,

   The motion of a hidden fire

   That trembles in the breast.


   Prayer is the burthen of a sigh,

   The falling of a tear;

   The upward glancing of an eye,

   When none but God is near.


   It is the simplest form of speech

   That infant lips can try,

   Prayer the sublimest strains that reach

   The Majesty on high.


   Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice

   Returning from his ways,

   While angels in their songs rejoice,

   And cry, "Behold he prays!"


   Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,

   The Christian's native air,

   His watchword at the gates of death;

   He enters heaven with prayer.


   The saints in prayer appear as one

   In word, and deed, and mind,

   While with the Father and the Son

   Sweet fellowship they find.


   Nor prayer is made by man alone,

   The Holy Spirit pleads,

   Jesus, on the eternal throne,

   For sinners intercedes.


   O Thou by whom we come to God,

   The life, the truth, the way!

   The path of prayer Thyself hast trod;

   Lord, teach us how to pray.

   The Lord's Prayer.--I.


   Our heavenly Father! hear our prayer;

   Thy name be hallowed every where;

   Thy Kingdom come; Thy perfect will,

   In earth as heaven, may all fulfil;--


   Give this day's bread, that we may live;

   Forgive our sins as we forgive;

   Lead us temptation's snares to shun,

   And save us from the Evil One:


   Now, and for ever, unto Thee,

   The kingdom, power, and glory be!

   Thus, as our Saviour taught to say,

   In truth and spirit, let us pray.
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN LXIV.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   Wants and Wishes in Prayer.


   What shall we ask of God in prayer?

   Whatever good we want;

   Whatever man may seek to share,

   And God in mercy grant.


   Father of all our mercies, Thou

   In whom we move and live,

   Hear us in heaven thy dwelling now,

   And answer and forgive.


   When, bound with sins and trespasses,

   From wrath we fain would flee,

   Lord, cancel our unrighteousness,

   And set the captive free.


   When, harass'd by ten thousand foes,

   Our helplessness we feel,

   O God, the weary soul repose,

   The wounded spirit heal,


   When dire temptations gather round,

   And threaten or allure,

   By storm or calm, in Thee be found

   A refuge strong and sure.


   When age advances, may we grow

   In faith, and hope, and love,

   And walk in holiness below,

   To holiness above.


   When earthly joys and cares depart,

   Desire and envy cease,

   Be Thou the portion of our heart,

   In Thee may we have peace.


   When flames these elements destroy,

   And worlds in judgment stand,

   May we lift up our heads with joy,

   And meet at Thy right hand.
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN LXV.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   The Preparation of the Heart.


   Lord, teach us how to pray aright,

   With reverence and with fear;

   Though dust and ashes in Thy sight,

   We may, we must draw near.


   We perish if we cease from prayer;

   Oh! grant us power to pray;

   And when to meet Thee we prepare,

   Lord, meet us by the way.


   Burden'd with guilt, convinced of sin,

   In weakness, want, and woe,

   Fightings without, and fears within,

   Lord, whither shall we go?


   God of all grace, we bring to Thee

   A broken, contrite heart;

   Give, what Thine eye delights to see,

   Truth in the inward part.


   Give deep humility; the sense

   Of godly sorrow give;

   A strong, desiring confidence

   To hear Thy voice and live;--


   Faith in the only Sacrifice

   That can for sin atone;

   To cast our loves, to fix our eyes

   On Christ, on Christ alone;--


   Patience to watch, and wait, and weep,

   Though mercy long delay;

   Courage, our fainting souls to keep,

   And trust Thee though Thou slay.


   Give these, and then Thy will be done;

   Thus, strenghen'd with all might,

   We, through Thy Spirit and Thy Son,

   Shall pray, and pray aright.

   Remembrance and Resolution.--Ps. lxii.


   O God! Thou art my God alone;

   Early to Thee my soul shall cry,

   A pilgrim in a land unknown,

   A thirsty land whose Springs are dry.


   Oh! that it were as it hath been,

   When, praying in the holy place,

   Thy power and glory I have seen,

   And mark'd the footsteps of Thy grace!


   Yet through this rough and thorny maze,

   I follow hard on Thee, my God!

   Thine hand unseen upholds my ways,

   I safely tread where Thou hast trod.


   Thee, in the watches of the night,

   When I remember on my bed,

   Thy presence makes the darkness light,

   Thy guardian wings are round my head.


   Better than life itself Thy love,

   Dearer than all beside to me;

   For whom have I in heaven above,

   Or who on earth, compared with Thee?


   Praise with my heart, my mind, my voice,

   For all Thy mercy I will give;

   My soul shall still in God rejoice,

   My tongue shall bless Thee while I live.

   Asking, Seeking, Finding.--Matt. vii. 7, 8.


   Ask, and ye shall receive;

   On this my hope I build:

   I ask forgiveness, and believe

   My prayer shall be fulfill'd.


   Seek, and expect to find:

   Wounded to death in soul,

   I seek the Saviour of mankind;

   His touch can make me whole.


   Knock, and with patience wait,

   Faith shall free entrance win:

   I stand and knock at mercy's gate;

   Lord Jesus! let me in.


   How should I ask in vain?

   Seek, and not find Thee, Lord?

   Knock, and yet no admittance gain?

   Is it not in Thy word?


   Time, ruin, change, decay,

   The lines can never blot,

   Though heaven and earth shall pass away,

   Thy Word, O God! shall not.

   "O Thou, that hearest Prayer!"--Ps. lxv. 2.


   Thou, God, art a consuming fire,

   Yet mortals may find grace,

   From toil and tumult to retire,

   And meet Thee face to face.


   Though "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord!"

   Seraph to seraph sings,

   And angel-choirs, with one accord,

   Worship, with veiling wings;--


   Though earth Thy footstool, heaven Thy throne,

   Thy way amidst the sea,

   Thy path deep floods, Thy steps unknown,

   Thy counsels mystery:--


   Yet wilt Thou look on him who lies

   A suppliant at Thy feet;

   And hearken to the feeblest cries

   That reach Thy mercy-seat.


   Between the cherubim of old

   Thy glory was express'd;

   But God, through Christ, we now behold

   In flesh made manifest.


   Through Him who all our sickness felt,

   Who all our sorrows bare,

   Through Him in whom Thy fulness dwelt

   We offer up our prayer.


   Touch'd with a feeling of our woes,

   Jesus, our High Priest, stands;

   All our infirmities He knows,

   Our souls are in His hands.


   He bears them up with strength divine,

   When at Thy feet we fall;

   Lord, cause, Thy face on us to shine

   Hear us,--on Thee we call.

   Scriptural Prayers.


   With wandering Jacob, let us say--

   "If God will keep me by the way,

   Guide and defend me, clothe and feed,

   Then God shall be my God indeed."


   With Him who led the ransom'd flock

   Through the Red Sea to Sinai's rock,

   Be this our one supreme request,

   Thy presence with us go or rest."


   Join we God's people from our youth,

   Quit the vain world like humble Ruth;

   With them resolved our lot to try,

   Rejoice or suffer, live or die.


   Like Joshua through this war of life,

   Victor in many a deadly strife,

   May each this solemn pledge record,

   "I and my house will serve the Lord."


   When prayers and vows to heaven we make,

   The words of Solomon we'll take,

   Freely for every blessing call,

   Yet ask forgiveness with them all.


   And now, O Lord our God! to Thee,

   This sum of our petition be,

   The language of Thy blessed Son,

   "Father! Thy will, not mine, be done."

   Solomon's Prayer for Wisdom.


   Almighty God, in humble prayer,

   To Thee our souls we lift,

   Do Thou our waiting minds prepare

   For Thy most needful gift.


   We ask not golden streams of wealth,

   Along our path to flow,

   We ask not undecaying health,

   Nor length of years below.


   We ask not honours which an hour

   May bring or take away;

   We ask not pleasure, pomp, or power,

   Lest we should go astray.


   We ask for wisdom:--Lord, impart

   The knowledge how to live;

   A wise and understanding heart

   To all before Thee give.


   For we, like children, born in sin

   Know not till Thou hast taught,

   How to go out, or how come in,

   By word, or deed, or thought.


   The young remember Thee in youth,

   Before the evil days;

   The old be guided by Thy truth

   In Wisdom's pleasant ways.

   8.8.8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   Our Saviour's Prayers.


   Preamble.

      High Priest for sinners, Jesus, Lord!

      Whom as a Man of Griefs I see

      Thy prayers on earth, while I record,

      If still in heaven Thou pray'st for me,

      My soul, for thy soul's travail claim,

      I seek salvation in Thy name.


   Part I.

      Baptized as for the dead He rose,

      With prayer from Jordan's hallow'd flood,

      Ere long by persecuting foes,

      To be baptized in His own blood,

      The Father's voice proclaim'd the Son,

      The spirit witness'd--These are One.


      Early He rose, ere dawn of day,

      And to a desert place withdrew;

      There was He wont to watch and pray,

      Until His locks were wet with dew,

      And birds below, and beams above,

      Had warn'd Him thence to works of love.


      At evening, when His toils were o'er,

      He sent the multitudes away,

      And on the mountain or the shore,

      All night remain'd to watch and pray,

      Till o'er His head the stars grew dim,

      When was the hour of rest for Him?


      In field or city, while He taught,

      Oft went His spirit forth in sighs;

      And when His mightiest deeds were wrought,

      To heaven he lifted up His eyes:

      He pray'd at Lazarus' grave and shed

      Tears with the word that waked the dead.


      When mothers brought their babes, He took

      The lambs into His arms, and pray'd;

      On Tabor, His transfigured look,

      While praying, turn'd the sun to shade,

      And forms, too pure for human sight,

      Grew visible amidst that light.


      "O Father! save me from this hour,

      Yet for this hour to earth I came,"

      He pray'd in weakness; then, with power

      Cried, "Father! glorify Thy name;"

      --"I have," a voice from heaven replied,

      "And still it shall be glorified."


   Part II.

      For Peter, bold in speech and brave

      In act, yet in temptation frail,

      (As once he proved when on the wave),

      Christ pray'd lest his weak faith should fail;

      And when by Satan's snare enthrall'd,

      His eye the wanderer recall'd.


      Amidst His mournful family,

      Who soon must see His face no more,

      With what divine discourse did He

      Strength to their fainting souls restore!

      Then pray'd for all His people,--where

      Have words recorded such a prayer?


      Next, with strong cries and bitter tears,

      Thrice hallow'd He that doleful ground,

      Where, trembling with mysterious fears,

      His sweat, like blood-drops, fell around,

      And, being in an agony,

      He prayed yet more earnestly.


      Here oft in spirit let me, kneel,

      Share in the speechless griefs I see,

      And, while He felt what I should feel,

      Feel all His power of love to me,

      Break my hard heart, and grace supply

      For Him, who died for me, to die.


      Stretch'd on the ignominious tree,

      For those, whose hands had nail'd Him there,

      Who stood and mock'd His misery,

      He offer'd up his latest prayer;

      Then with the voice of victory cried,

      "Tis finish'd!" bow'd His head, and died.


      There all His prayers were answer'd;--all

      The fruits of His soul's travail gain'd;

      The cup of wormwood and of gall,

      Down to the dregs His lips had drain'd;

      Accomplish'd was the Eternal plan,

      He tasted death for every man.


      Now by the throne of God He stands,

      Aloft the golden censer bears,

      And offers, with high priestly hands,

      Pure incense with his people's prayers;

      Well pleased the Father eyes, the Son,

      And says to each request, "Tis done."

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   Prayer for Increase of Holy Wisdom.


   O for the wisdom from above,

   Pure, gentle, peaceable, and mild,

   The innocency of the dove,

   The meekness of a little child.


   Wise may we be to know the truth,

   Reveal'd in every Scripture page;

   Wise to salvation from our youth,

   And wiser grow from stage to stage.


   Then if to riper years, we rise,

   And well the work of grace be wrought

   Within ourselves,--we shall be wise

   To teach in turn what we were taught.


   Yet still be learning, day by day,

   More of God's Word, God's way, God's will;

   His law, rejoicing to obey,

   Pleas'd His whole pleasure to fulfill,


   Wise to win souls, if thus we're led,

   How blest will be our lot below,

   Blessings to share, and blessings shed

   On all with whom to heaven we go.


   So may we reach that home at length,

   And, clad in righteousness divine,

   Even as the sun, when in his strength,

   And as the stars, for ever, shine.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   Pleading in Prayer.


   How shall a contrite spirit pray,

   A broken heart its griefs make known,

   A weary wanderer find the way

   To peace and rest?--Through Christ alone.


   He died that we might die to sin;

   He rose, that, we to God might rise;

   By His own blood He enter'd in

   The holy place beyond the skies.


   There, as our great High Priest He stands,

   And pleads before the Mercy-seat,

   Our cause is in His faithful hands,

   Our enemies beneath his feet.


   Father, in Him we claim our part,

   For Thy Son's sake accept us now,

   In Him well-pleased Thou always art,

   Well pleased with us through Him be Thou.


   O look on thine anointed One;

   Thy gift in Him is all our plea,

   Our righteousness,--what He hath done;

   Our prayer--His prayer for us to Thee.


   So, while He intercedes above,

   In His dear name may we believe,

   And all the fulness of Thy love

   Into our inmost souls receive.

   James Montgomery

   Perseverance in Prayer.


   Patient prayer has power with God;

   Thus, while Moses raised the rod,

   Israel o'er the foe prevail'd,

   But grew feeble when he fail'd,

   Till, by Hur and Aaron's care,

   Intercession held up Prayer.


   Pray ye, pray and never faint,

   Mourning Sinner, tempted Saint!

   Faith and Hope your hands sustain,

   Victory then ye must obtain,

   Yea, and more than conquerors prove

   Through your great Redeemer's love.

   The Name above every Name.


   Bow every knee at Jesus' name,

   And every tongue confess;

   Let the Redeem'd with joy proclaim

   "The Lord our Righteousness."


   To Him through all the rounds of time

   Perpetual prayer be made;

   O'er sea and land, from clime to clime,

   Homage to Him be paid.


   From young and old with every breath

   Let prayer and praise arise;

   Life be the "daily offering"--Death

   "The evening sacrifice."


   Let heaven and earth reply "Amen!"

   And all their hosts adore,

   The Lord of Angels and of men

   For ever evermore.

   James Montgomery

   The Confidence of Prayer.--Matt. xiv. 22.


   Why thus, my soul, cast down?

   And why disquieted?

   Black though the tempest frown,

   The surge pass o'er thy head;

   Wait the fourth watch;--for One who saves

   Comes to thee, walking on the waves.


   Lord! Lord! if it be Thou,

   Bid me come down to Thee;

   Jesus! I know Thee now,

   And walk upon the sea;

   Faith fails; ah me! the gulf runs high,

   Save, Lord, I sink! O save, I die!


   I grasp thy outstretch'd hand;

   We climb the vessel's side;

   And lo! we touch the land,

   The storm is pacified;

   While winds and waves thy voice obey,

   Oh! why am I more deaf than they?


   Why, when I know Thy will

   Is my salvation, Lord,

   When Thou says't "Peace, be still!"

   How can I doubt Thy word?

   Speak with that all-commanding might,

   Which said to darkness,--"Be thou light!"


   Speak with that power, which said

   To Peter, "Follow me!"

   Call'd Lazarus from the dead;

   Then must I yield to Thee,

   For Thee, like Peter, all forsake.

   Like Lazarus, from the dead awake.

   For Acceptance in Prayer, and daily Guidance.--Ps. cxli.


   Lord, let my prayer like incense rise,

   And when I lift my hands to Thee,

   As on the evening sacrifice

   Look down from heaven well-pleased on me.


   Set Thou a watch to keep my tongue,

   Let not my heart to sin incline;

   Save me from men who practise wrong,

   Let me not share their mirth and wine.


   But let the righteous, when I stray,

   Smite me in love,--his strokes are kind;

   His mild reproofs, like oil, allay

   The wounds they make, and heal the mind.


   Mine eyes are unto Thee, my God!

   Behold me humbled in the dust;

   I kiss the hand that wields the rod,

   I own thy chastisements are just.


   But O! redeem me from the snares

   With which the world surrounds my feet,

   Its riches, vanities, and cares,

   Its love, its hatred, its deceit.

   Closet Prayer.--Matt. vi. 6.


   O! What a privilege to kneel,

   Fall down and worship at thy feet,

   My God! my Father! and to feel

   With Thee communion high and sweet:--


   To pour my spirit out in prayer,

   Or, on the wings of praise ascend,

   Like Moses to the Mount, and there

   Commune with Thee, as friend with friend.

   James Montgomery

   Daily Prayer.--Luke xviii. 1.


   Come to the Morning Prayer,

   Come let us kneel and pray;

   Prayer is the Christian pilgrim's staff

   To walk with God all day.


   At noon, beneath the Rock

   Of Ages, rest and pray;

   Sweet is that shadow from the heat,

   When the sun smites by day.


   At eve, shut to the door,

   Round the home-altar pray,

   And finding there "the House of God,"

   At "heaven's gate" close the day.


   When midnight seals our eyes,

   Let each in spirit say,

   "I sleep, but my heart waketh, Lord,

   With Thee to watch and pray."

HYMN LXXX.

   7.7.7.7

   James Montgomery

   A prayer for every Day and all Day long.


   In the morning hear my voice,

   Let me in thy light rejoice;

   God, my Sun! my strength renew,

   Send thy blessing down like dew.


   Through the duties of the day,

   Grant me, grace to watch and pray;

   Live as always seeing Thee,

   Knowing, "Thou, God! seest me."


   When the evening skies display

   Richer pomp than noon's array,

   Be the shades of death to me

   Bright with immortality.


   When the round of care is run,

   And the stars succeed the sun,

   Songs of praise with prayer unite,

   Crown the day, and hail the night.


   Thus with thee, my God! my Friend!

   Time begin, continue, end,

   While life's joys and sorrows pass

   Like the changes of the grass.

   An Evening Thought.--Ps. iv.


   While many cry in nature's night

   Ah! who will show the way to bliss?

   Lord, lift on us thy saving light;

   We seek no other guide than this.


   Gladness Thy sacred presence brings,

   More than the joyful reaper knows;

   Or he who treads the grapes and sings

   While with new wine his vat o'erflows.


   In peace I lay me down to sleep;

   Thine arm, O Lord! shall stay my head,

   Thine Angel spread his tent, and keep

   His midnight watch around my bed.

   Fervent Supplication.--Ps. cxxx.


   Out of the depths of woe,

   To Thee, O Lord! I cry;

   Darkness surrounds me, but I know

   That Thou art ever nigh.


   Then hearken to my voice,

   Give ear to my complaint;

   Thou bidst the mourning soul rejoice,

   Thou comfortest the faint.


   I cast my hope on Thee,

   Thou canst, Thou wilt forgive;

   Wert Thou to mark iniquity,

   Who in thy sight could live?


   Humbly on Thee I wait,

   Confessing all my sin;

   Lord, I am knocking at thy gate,

   Open and take me in.


   Like them, whose longing eyes

   Watch till the morning-star,

   (Though late and seen through tempests) rise,

   Heaven's portals to unbar:--


   Like them I watch and pray,

   And though it tarry long,

   Catch the first gleam of welcome day,

   Then burst into a song,


   Glory to God above!

   The waters soon will cease,

   For lo! the swift-returning dove

   Brings home the sign of peace.


   Though storms his face obscure,

   And dangers threaten loud,

   Jehovah's covenant is sure;

   His bow is in the cloud.

   For Grace to surrender all to Christ.


   Jesus, our best-beloved friend,

   Draw out our souls in pure desire,

   Jesus, in love to us descend,

   Baptize us with thy Spirit's fire.


   On thy Redeeming name we call,

   Poor and unworthy though we be:

   Pardon and sanctify us all;

   Let each thy full salvation see.


   Our souls and bodies we resign,

   To fear and follow thy commands;

   O take our hearts--our hearts are thine,

   Accept the service of our hands.


   Firm, faithful, watching unto prayer,

   May we Thy blessed will obey;

   Toil in Thy vineyard here, and bear

   The heat and burden of the day.


   Yet, Lord, for us a resting-place,

   In heaven at thy right hand prepare;

   And till we see Thee face to face,

   Be all our conversation there.

HYMN LXXXIV.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   For the Gift of the Holy Spirit.


   Power from on high, O God, impart,

   Power in thy gospel to believe;

   Power to surrender our whole heart,

   Power all thy mercy to receive.


   The Word to us in vain were given,

   We hear, we read, we learn in vain;

   In vain thy Son came down from heaven,

   If thou "the Spirit's might" restrain.


   Here be His sacred influence felt,

   With searching, cleansing, quickening force,

   Till souls of millstone-hardness melt,

   And flow like waters from their source.


   Convinced and humbled in the dust

   Beneath the burden of our guilt,

   We own Thy law's dread sentence just,

   But plead the blood of pardon spilt.


   Thy Spirit witness with that blood,

   And Christ our Saviour glorify;

   While we, as children born of God,

   With rapture, "Abba! Father!" cry.

   Resignation.


   One prayer I have,--all prayers in one,

   When I am wholly Thine;

   Thy will, my God, Thy will be done,

   And let that will be mine.


   All-wise, all-mighty, and all-good,

   In Thee I firmly trust;

   Thy ways, unknown or understood,

   Are merciful and just.


   Is life with many comforts crown'd,

   Upheld in peace and health,

   With dear affections twined around,

   Lord, in my time of wealth,--


   May I remember, that to Thee,

   Whate'er I have I owe;

   And back in gratitude from me,

   May all Thy bounties flow.


   Thy gifts are only then enjoy'd,

   When used as talents lent;

   Those talents only well employ'd,

   When in Thy service spent.


   And though Thy wisdom takes away,

   Shall I arraign Thy will?

   No, let me bless Thy name, and say,

   "The Lord is gracious still."


   A pilgrim through the earth I roam,

   Of nothing long possest,

   And all must fail when I go home,

   For this is not my rest.


   Write but my name upon the roll

   Of Thy redeem'd above,

   Then heart, and mind, and strength and soul,

   I'll love Thee for Thy love.

   Stand up, and bless the Lord,

   Ye people of His choice:

   Stand up, and bless the Lord your God

   With heart, and soul, and voice.


   Though high above all praise,

   Above all blessing high,

   Who would not fear his Holy name,

   And laud and magnify?


   O for the living flame,

   From His own altar brought,

   To touch our lips, our minds inspire,

   And wing to heaven our thought!


   There, with benign regard,

   Our hymns He deigns to hear;

   Though unrevealed to mortal sense,

   The spirit feels him near.


   God is our strength and song,

   And His salvation ours;

   Then be his love in Christ proclaim'd

   With all our ransom'd powers.


   Stand up and bless the Lord,

   Henceforth for evermore.

   Glory to God in the Highest.--Luke ii. 13.


   Songs of praise the angels sang,

   When Jehovah's work begun,

   When He spake, and it was done.


   Songs of praise awoke the morn,

   When the Prince of Peace was born:

   Songs of praise arose, when He

   Captive led captivity.


   Heaven and earth must pass away,

   Songs of praise shall crown that day;

   God will make new heavens, new earth,

   Songs of praise shall hail their birth.


   And can man alone be dumb,

   Till that glorious kingdom come?

   No;--the Church delights to raise

   Psalms, and hymns, and songs of praise.


   Saints below, with heart and voice,

   Still in songs of praise rejoice;

   Learning here, by faith and love,

   Songs of praise to sing above.

   Songs of praise shall conquer death;

   Then, amidst eternal joy,

   Songs of praise their powers employ.

   God's everlasting Son,--the Word!

   Thou, to retrieve man's mortal doom,

   Didst not abhor the Virgin's womb;

   And, having overcome, for us,

   Death's sharpness, on the accursed cross,

   Open'dst heaven's kingdom, to receive

   All those who in Thy name believe.

   At God's right hand, exalted there,

   Thou dost the Father's glory share;

   And thence, we know, when comes the end,

   Thou wilt, to be our Judge, descend.

   Help, Lord, Thy servants, that we may

   Find mercy in that dreadful day;

   Redeem'd with Thy most precious blood,

   And number'd with Thy saints, who stood

   Firm in the faith, may we be found,

   In glory everlasting, crown'd.

   Thy people save,--from age to age,

   Govern and bless Thine heritage;

   Daily we magnify Thy name,

   World without end Thy praise proclaim.

   Vouchsafe this day to keep from sin

   Our going out, and coming in:

   O Lord! have mercy on us all,

   Have mercy on us when we call;

   Thy mercy, Lord, to us extend,

   On Thee alone our hopes depend;

   Lord, we have put our trust in Thee,

   Confounded let us never be.

   Hallelujah.


   Hark! the song of Jubilee;

   Loud as mighty thunders roar,

   Or the fulness of the sea,

   When it breaks upon the shore:

   Hallelujah! for the Lord

   God Omnipotent, shall reign;

   Hallelujah! let the word

   Echo round the earth and main.


   Hallelujah! hark the sound

   From the depths unto the skies,

   Wakes above, beneath, around,

   All creation's harmonies;

   See Jehovah's banner furl'd,

   Sheath'd His sword: He speaks--'tis done,

   And the Kingdoms of this world

   Are the Kingdoms of His Son.


   He shall reign from pole to pole

   With illimitable sway;

   He shall reign, when like a scroll

   Yonder heavens have passed away:

   Then the end;--beneath His rod,

   Man's last enemy shall fall;

   Hallelujah! Christ in God,

   God in Christ, is all in all.

   The Lord's Day.


   This is the day the Lord hath made,

   Let young and old rejoice;

   To Him be vows and homage paid,

   Whose service is our choice.


   This is the temple of the Lord,

   How dreadful is this place!

   With meekness let us hear His word,

   With reverence seek His face.


   This is the homage He requires,--

   The voice of praise and prayer,

   The soul's affections, hopes, desires,

   Ourselves and all we are.


   While rich and poor for mercy call,

   Propitious from the skies,

   The Lord, the Maker of them all,

   Accepts the sacrifice.


   Well-pleased through Jesus Christ His Son,

   From sin he grants release;

   According to their faith 'tis done,

   He bids them go in peace.

   Longing for the Courts of the Lord's House.--Ps. xlii.


   As the hart, with eager looks,

   Panteth for the water-brooks,

   So my soul, athirst for Thee,

   Pants the loving God to see:

   When, O when, with filial fear,

   Lord, shall I to Thee draw near?


   Tears my food by night, by day,

   Grief consumes my strength away;

   While his craft the Tempter plies,

   "Where is now Thy God?" he cries;

   This would sink me to despair

   But I pour my soul in prayer.


   For, in happier times, I went,

   Where the multitudes frequent;

   I, with them, was wont to bring

   Homage to Thy courts, my King!

   I with them was wont to raise

   Festal hymns on holy days.


   Why art thou cast down, my soul!

   God, thy God, shall make thee whole:

   Why art thou disquieted?

   God shall lift thy fallen head;

   And his countenance benign

   Be the saving health of thine.

   Met in His house with one accord,

   At His commandment we draw nigh.


   Not hecatombs he now requires,

   The daily blood of slaughterd beasts;

   Quench'd are the ancient altar fires,

   Extinct the line of typic priests.


   Man's only Mediator stands

   Before the Father's throne to plead

   His sole atonement: in his hands

   Our cause is safe; it must succeed.

   To seek Thy face, Thy presence feel.


   From earthen vessels we receive

   The living streams of truth divine;

   Enter we now Thy gates with praise,

   With reverence at Thine altar bend,

   With gladness our thanksgivings raise,

   With meekness to Thy Word attend.


   So, when the gospel, in Thy name,

   From human lips salutes our ear,

   May our responding hearts exclaim,

   "Speak to us, Lord; Thy servants hear."


   Paul then may plant the precious grain,

   For Thine will be the quickening power;

   Apollos water, not in vain,

   For Thou wilt give the genial shower.


   The scatter'd seed thus sown in hope

   Shall spring and spread with large increase,

   Of love, joy, righteousness and peace.

   Come,--in the House of God appear,

   For 'tis an holy day.


   Our willing feet shall stand

   Within the temple-door,

   While young and old in many a band

   Shall throng the sacred floor.


   Thither the tribes repair,

   Where all are wont to meet,

   And joyful in the House of Prayer

   Bend at the Mercy-seat.


   Pray for Jerusalem,

   The Lord from Heaven be kind to them

   That love the dear abode.


   Within these walls may peace

   And harmony be found:

   Zion, in all thy palaces,

   Prosperity abound.


   God scorns not humble things;

   These, though the proud despise,

   The children of the King of kings,

   Are training for the skies.


   May none who thus are taught,

   From glory be cast down,

   But all through faith and patience brought

   To an eternal crown.

   For praise is comely, prayer is sweet:


   And meek obedience to his will

   Is perfect freedom to their mind,

   Who love his service and fulfil,

   With heart and hand, the work assign'd.


   One day, Lord God! within thy courts,

   Is better than a thousand spent

   In vain delights, or wanton sports,

   That leave remorse and discontent.


   Rather we'll choose the lowest place,

   The keepers of Thy doors to be,

   Than dwell where sinners, void of grace,

   Forget themselves, forgetting Thee.


   Our willing souls we now would yield

   To Thee, as Thine alone to live,

   Assured Thou wilt, our sun and shield,

   No good withhold,--all blessing give.


   So, from Thy sanctuary shower

   On young and old, with large increase,

   And each in his own way was lost.


   But the good Shepherd from above

   Came into the wilderness,

   To seek and save, to heal and bless.


   He call'd us with His gentle voice,

   Now to that call may we reply,

   And make His staff and rod our choice,

   Amidst His flock to live and die.

   Thou Lord art God, thou, Lord, alone;

   Thy vows upon our souls we take.


   Bind Thou in Heaven what thus we bind

   On earth, in great infirmity,

   But put Thy laws within our mind,

   These shall our strength, our safeguard be.


   We seek salvation, in the name

   Of Jesus thy beloved Son;

   We plead His prayer; we urge His claim;

   O Lord of Hosts! to me

   Thy tabernacles are!

   My flesh cries out for Thee;

   My heart and soul, with heavenward fire,

   To Thee, the living God, aspire,


   The sparrow finds a place

   To build her little nest,

   The swallows' wandering race

   Hither return to rest;

   Beneath Thy roof their young ones cry,

   And round Thine Altar learn to fly.


   Thrice blessed they who dwell

   Within Thy house, my God!

   Where daily praises swell,

   And still the floor is trod

   By those, who in Thy presence bow;

   By those whose King and God art Thou.


   Through Baca's arid vale,

   As pilgrims when they pass

   The well-springs never fail;

   Fresh rain renews the grass;

   From strength to strength they journey still,

   Till all appear on Zion's hill.


   Lord God of Hosts! give ear,

   A gracious answer yield;

   O God of Jacob! hear;

   Behold, O God! our shield;

   Look on Thine own Anointed One

   And save through thy beloved Son.


   Lord, I would rather stand

   A keeper at Thy gate,

   Than on the king's right hand

   In tents of earthly state;

   One day within Thy courts, one day

   Is worth a thousand cast away.


   God is a sun of light,

   Glory and grace to shed,

   God is a helm of might

   To guard the faithful head.

   O Lord of Hosts! how happy he,

   The man who puts his trust in Thee.

   To choose the better part,

   Saul's slaughter-breathing zeal reproved,

   And open'd Lydia's heart.


   Such grace be ours, howe'er the past

   Have well or ill been spent;

   To-day,--since this may be our last,--

   To-day let us repent.


   Now young and old, now great and small,

   Seek we our Saviour's face,

   That we henceforth this day may call

   A day indeed of grace.

   Invitation to seek the better Country.


   Come, let us go to heaven;--the way,

   Like darkness, opens into day,

   When from the turning-point of night,

   Breaks the first beam of morning light.


   Come let us go to heaven;--our guide

   Is Christ who lived, is Christ who died,

   And rose again; His staff and rod,

   Through life and death, will lead to God.


   Come, let us go to heaven;--forsake

   Sin, earth, and hell, and gladly take

   His easy yoke, His pleasant load,

   And brave the dangers of the road.


   Come, let us go to heaven;--and press

   On through the howling wilderness;

   Yet fear not, little flock, though foes

   Without, within, your course oppose.


   Come, let us go to heaven,--no power,

   Not Satan roaring to devour,

   Nor all his hosts, can harm, for ye,

   Through Christ, shall more than conquerors be.


   Come, let us go to heaven;--and meet

   Once and for ever, round His feet;

   Yea, in Christ's kingdom, as His own,

   Sit down with Him upon His throne.


   Can these things be?--they are, are sure

   To all who to the end endure;

   While unbelief cries, "can they be?"

   Come, let us go to heaven and see.

   Evening Song for the Sabbath-day.


   Millions within Thy courts have met,

   Millions this day before Thee bow'd;

   Their face Zion-ward were set,

   Vows with their lips to Thee they vow'd;


   But Thou, soul-searching God! hast known

   The hearts of all that bent the knee,

   And hast accepted those alone,

   In spirit and truth, that worshipp'd Thee.


   People of many a tribe and tongue,

   Men of strange colours, climates, lands,

   Have heard Thy truth, Thy glory sung,

   And offer'd prayer with holy hands.


   Still, as the light of morning broke

   O'er islands, continent, or deep,

   Thy far-spread family awoke,

   Sabbath all round the world to keep.


   From east to west, the sun survey'd,

   From north to south, adoring throngs;

   And atill, where evening stretch'd her shade,

   The stars came out to hear their songs.


   Harmonious as the wind and seas,

   In halcyon hours when storms are flown,

   Arose earth's Babel languages,

   In pure accordance to the throne.


   Not angel trumpets sound more clear,

   Nor elders' harps, nor seraphs' lays,

   Yield sweeter music to Thine ear

   Than humble prayer and thankful praise.


   And not a prayer, a tear, a sigh,

   Hath fail'd this day some suit to gain;

   To those in trouble, Thou wert nigh,

   Not one hath sought Thy face in vain.


   Thy poor were bountifully fed,

   Thy chasten'd sons have kissd the rod,

   Thy mourners have been comforted,

   The pure in heart have seen their God.


   Yet one prayer more!--and be it one,

   In which both heaven and earth accord;

   Fulfil Thy promise to Thy Son,

   Let all that breathe call Jesus Lord.

   Seeking the Lord's Face.--Psalm xxvii.


   One thing, with all my soul's desire,

   I sought and will pursue;

   What Thine own Spirit doth inspire,

   Lord, for Thy servant do.


   Grant me within Thy courts a place,

   Among Thy saints a seat,

   For ever to behold Thy face,

   And worship at Thy feet.


   In Thy pavilion to abide,

   When storms of trouble blow,

   And in Thy tabernacle hide,

   Secure from every foe.


   "Seek ye My face-" without delay,

   When thus I hear Thee speak,

   My heart would leap for joy, and say,

   "Thy face, Lord, will I seek."


   Then leave me not, when griefs assail,

   And earthly comforts flee,

   When father, mother, kindred fail,

   My God, remember me.


   Oft had I fainted, and resign'd

   Of every hope my hold,

   But mine affections brought to mind

   Thy benefits of old.


   Wait on the Lord, with courage wait;

   My soul, disdain to fear:

   The righteous Judge is at the gate,

   And thy redemption near.

   To me to live, let it be Christ,

   To me to die will then be gain,

   If here into his death baptized,

   His resurrection I attain.


   As He was in the world, let me,

   Born from above, my course fulfil;

   My meat, my drink, my business be

   To do my heavenly Father's will.


   So, when He comes, with glory crown'd,

   To claim His own, and seal them His,

   I in his likeness shall be found,

   For I shall see Him as He is.

   Gratitude for Redemption.--Ps. cxvi.


   I love the Lord;--He lent an ear,

   When I for help implored;

   He rescued me from all my fear,

   Therefore I love the Lord.


   Bound hand and foot with chains of sin,

   Death dragg'd me for his prey;

   The pit was moved to take me in,

   All hope was far away.


   I cried in agony of mind,

   "Lord, I beseech Thee, save:"

   He held me;--Death his prey resign'd,

   And Mercy shut the grave.


   Return, my soul, unto thy rest,

   From God no longer roam:

   His hand hath bountifally blest,

   His goodness call'd thee home.


   What shall I render unto Thee,

   My Saviour in distress,

   For all Thy benefits to me;

   So great and numberless?


   This will I do, for Thy love's sake,

   And thus Thy power proclaim,

   Salvation's sacred cup I'll take,

   And call upon Thy name.


   Thou God of covenanted grace!

   Hear and record my vow,

   While in Thy courts I seek Thy face,

   And at Thine altar bow.


   Henceforth myself to Thee I give,

   With single, heart and eye,

   To walk before Thee while I live,

   And bless Thee when I die.

   The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.


   We know the condescending grace

   Of our Lord Jesus Christ:--We know

   He came to seek and save our race

   From sin, and death, and endless woe.


   Rich ere the world began,--on earth

   Impov'rish'd to retrieve our loss,

   And, from the manger at His birth,

   Exalted only to the Cross.


   Yet in that humble crib was He

   God in the flesh made manifest:

   And, on that ignominious tree,

   God over all, for ever blest.


   Then, at His manger let us meet,

   In spirit our Emmanuel own,

   Or round the cross, beneath His feet,

   Hail Him as on the Father's Throne.


   That throne and cross united here

   Time nor eternity can part,

   As one henceforth the twain appear,

   Seen only by the pure in heart:--


   The pure in heart, for they alone

   Can on the cross's glory gaze,

   Where the Lamb slain amidst the Throne

   Adoring saints and angels praise.

   "Himself He could not save."--Mark xv. 31.


   "He saved others," scorners cried,

   Beholding Jesus crucified;

   "Is this the Son of God with power?

   Lo, in His own afflictive hour,

   Himself he cannot save."


   He was the Son of God with power,

   He "came unto that very hour;"

   I'll joy in His reproach and shame,

   "He savest others;" I'll exclaim,

   "Himself He could not save."


   His agony and bloody sweat,

   His cross and passion paid my debt;

   He saved others when he fell,

   Yet,--who the mystery can tell?

   Himself, He could not save.


   Love, love unthroned the Son of God;

   Love bruised Him with the Father's rod;

   Love gave, and love reclaim'd His breath;

   He saved others by His death;

   Himself he could not save.


   Were Love and Deity at strife?

   No,--freely He resign'd His life;

   God freely sent Him from above;

   Love is of God, for God is love;

   Himself He could not Save.


   Have I hope beyond the grave;

   'Tis this, Himself he could not save;

   Hope full of immortality;

   He saved others, saved me;

   Himself He could not save.

   Christ Jesus our Pattern in doing and suffering.


   And did the Son of God appear

   A man of toil and suffering here?

   Him let us then our pattern make,

   Who toil'd and suffer'd for our sake.


   Though holy, harmless, undefiled,

   He learn'd obedience, from a child;

   Through youth in grace and wisdom grew,

   As man the Tempter's wiles o'erthrew.


   Glad tidings, when He went to preach,

   How mild and healing was His speech!

   Though with authority He taught,

   And miracles of mercy wrought.


   Rebuke and scorn He meekly bore,

   The more reviled He loved the more;

   Thus He delighted to fulfil

   Love's law,--His heavenly Father's will.


   O'er land and sea, whate'er the cost,

   He came to seek and save the lost;

   For this he hunger'd, thirsted, sigh'd,

   Watch'd, pray'd and labour'd, lived and died.


   Taught by the Holy Spirit may we

   In all things like our pattern be;

   By His, our words and actions framed

   And bear His cross, who bear His name.

   The power of Christ's Resurrection.


   Come see the place where Jesus lay,

   For He hath left his gloomy bed;

   What angel roll'd the stone away?

   What spirit brought Him from the dead?


   By His omnipotence He rose,

   By His own Spirit lived again,

   To crush for ever all His foes,

   To raise for ever ruin'd men.


   Those who His image here partake,

   Though worms in dust their flesh consume,

   Shall sleep in Jesus, and awake

   To life eternal from the tomb.


   What shall restore a world from death,

   Where Satan holds his murderous reign?

   Spirit of Jesus! With Thy breath

   Shake the dry bones, revive the slain.


   Dead while they live are Adam's race,

   By nature, since their Father's fall;

   But, lo! the messengers of grace

   Proclaim the gospel-hope to all.


   Hear it ye dead, of every clime,

   Before the second death begins;

   Come forth to this new life in time,

   This resurrection from your sins.

   The Resurrection.


   Morning of the Sabbath day,

   O thou sweetest hour of prime!

   Dart a retrospective ray

   O'er the eastern hills of time;

   Daybreak let my spirit see

   At the foot of Calvary.


   Joseph's sepulchre is nigh;

   Here the seal upon the stone,

   There the sentinel, with eye,

   Star-like, fix'd on that alone;

   All around is calm and clear,

   Life and death keep Sabbath here.


   Bright and brighter, beam on beam,

   Now, like first created light,

   From the rock-cleft, gleam by gleam,

   Shoots athwart the waning night,

   Till the splendour grows intense,

   Overpowering mortal sense.


   Glory turns with me to gloom,

   Sight, pulsation, thought depart,

   And the stone that closed the tomb

   Seems to lie upon my heart;

   With that shock the vision flies;

   Christ is risen;--and I may rise:--


   Rise, like Him, as, from this trance,

   When the trumpet calls the just

   To the Saints' inheritance,

   From their dwellings in the dust:

   By thy resurrection's power,

   Jesus, save me in that hour.


   Sabbath morning, hail to thee;

   O thou sweetest hour of prime!

   From the foot of Calvary,

   Now to Zion's top I climb,

   There my risen Lord to meet,

   In his temple, at his feet.

   I will remember Thee.


   Thy body, broken for my sake,

   My bread from heaven shall be;

   Thy testamental cup I take,

   And thus remember Thee?


   Gethsemane can I forget?

   Or there Thy conflict see,

   Thine agony and bloody sweat,

   And not remember Thee?


   When to the cross I turn mine eyes

   And rest on Calvary,

   O Lamb of God, my sacrifice!

   I must remember Thee:--


   Remember Thee, and all Thy pains,

   And all Thy love to me;

   Yea, while a breath, a pulse remains,

   Will I remember Thee.


   And when these failing lips grow dumb,

   And mind and memory flee,

   When Thou shalt in Thy Kingdom come,

   Jesus, remember me.

   Communion of my Saviour's blood,

   In Him to have my lot and part,

   To prove the virtue of that flood

   Which burst on Calvary from his heart;


   To feed by faith on Christ, my bread,

   His body broken on the tree,

   To live in Him, my living Head,

   Who died, and, rose again for me;


   This be my joy and comfort here,

   This pledge of future glory mine:

   Jesus, in spirit now appear,

   And break the bread, and pour the wine.


   From Thy dear hand, may I receive

   The tokens of Thy dying love,

   And, while I feast on earth, believe

   That I shall feast with thee above.


   Ah! there, though in the lowest place,

   Thee at Thy table could I meet,

   And see Thee, know Thee, face to face,

   For such a moment death were sweet.


   What then will their fruition be,

   Who meet in heaven with blest accord?

   A moment?--No, eternity!

   Christ in the Midst of His People.


   On the first Christian Sabbath eve,

   When His disciples met,

   O'er His lost fellowship to grieve,

   Nor knew the Scriptures yet.


   Lo, in their midst His form was seen,

   The form in which He died,--

   Their Master's marr'd and wounded mien,

   His hands, his feet, his side.


   Then were they glad their Lord to know,

   And worshipp'd, yet with fear;

   Jesus, again Thy presence show;

   Meet Thy disciples here.


   Be in our midst;--let faith rejoice

   Our risen Lord to view,

   And make our spirits hear Thy voice,

   Say, "Peace be unto you."


   Then, while we hearken, O unfold

   The Scriptures to our mind:

   Their mysteries let us now behold;

   Their hidden treasures find.


   Thee it behoved to suffer thus,

   And to Thy glory rise;

   Instruct, confirm, and strengthen us,

   And make Thy servants wise;--


   Wise to win souls, may we reveal

   Thy love to all around,

   And in ourselves its influence feel

   Yet more and more abound.


   And while with thee, in social hours,

   We commune through Thy word,

   May our hearts burn, and all our powers

   Confess, "It is the Lord."

   In the wilderness below;

   Upward now I bend my way,

   Part we here at break of day.


   Let me go, I may not tarry,

   Wrestling thus with doubts and fears,

   Angels wait my soul to carry,

   Where my risen Lord appears;

   Friends and kindred, weep not so,

   We have travell'd long together,

   Hand in hand, and heart in heart,

   Both through calm and stormy weather,

   And 'tis hard, 'tis hard to part,

   Yet we must;--"Farewell!" to you;

   Answer, one and all, "Adieu!"


   'Tis not darkness gathering round me,

   Which withdraws me from your sight;

   Walls of flesh no more can bound me,

   But, translated into light,

   Like the lark on mounting wing,

   Though unseen you hear me sing.


   Heaven's broad day hath o'er me broken,

   Far beyond earth's span of sky;

   Hallelujah!

   And while we see--transform'd to be,

   From bliss to bliss eternally.

   O'er sin, and death, and hell victorious;

   We confess, proclaim, adore Thee,

   We bow the knee, we fall before Thee,

   Thy love henceforth shall be our song;

   The parting of Christian Friends.


   Once more to Bethany,--once more

   His little flock the Saviour led;

   And while their hearts and eyes ran o'er,

   These were the gracious words He said:--


   "Go into all the world;--proclaim

   Pardon throughout the rebel-host;

   Baptize believers in the name

   Of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.


   "Power shall be given you from on high;

   The Father's promise I will send;

   But tarry, for the hour is nigh;

   Lo! I am with you to the end."


   Thus while He blesséd them, they saw

   A cloud that caught Him from their view;

   The heavens received Him;--dumb with awe,

   They gaz'd, they worshipp'd, and withdrew.


   Such was that parting;--here we meet

   In fellowship of Christian love,

   And sit as at our Master's feet,

   And hear Him speaking from above.


   Lord Jesus! so Thy servants teach,

   That when we from each other part,

   Our lips and lives to all may preach

   Thy gospel graven on our heart.

   Gifts.--I Cor. xiii.


   Could I command with voice or pen

   The tongues of Angels and of men,

   A tinkling cymbal, sounding brass

   My speech and preaching would surpass;

   Vain were such eloquence to me

   Without the grace of Charity.


   Could I the martyr's flame endure,

   Give all my goods to feed the poor;

   Had I the faith from Alpine steep

   To hurl the mountain to the deep,

   What were such zeal, such power to me

   Without the grace of Charity?


   Could I behold with prescient eye

   Things future as the things gone by;

   Could all earthly knowledge scan,

   And mete out heaven with a span,

   Poor were the chief of gifts to me

   Without the chiefest--Charity.


   Charity suffers long, is kind,

   Charity bears a humble mind,

   Rejoices not when ills befall,

   But glories in the weal of all;

   She hopes, believes, and envies not,

   Nor vaunts, nor murmurs o'er her lot.


   The tongues of teachers shall be dumb,

   Prophets discern not things to come,

   Knowledge shall vanish out of thought,

   And miracles no more be wrought,

   But Charity shall never fail,

   Her anchor is within the veil.

   Barnabas.--Acts, xi. 22-26.


   Of him the sacred record saith,

   He was a good man, full of faith,

   Who by the Holy Spirit led,

   Rejoiced to see the Gospel spread:--


   Spread by the Saints where'r they went

   From martyrdom to banishment;

   The cross through every region bore,

   And more oppress'd, prevail'd the more.


   From doom'd Jerusalem cast forth,

   Eastward and westward, south and north!

   On fertile field, and barren clod,

   They sow'd the seed, the Word of God.


   To heathen Antioch, when they came,

   And first received their Master's name,

   They gloried in it, and bequeath'd

   The inheritance to all that breathed:--


   To all that breathed by second birth,

   Children of God, though sons of earth,

   For "Christians," Christians such shall be

   Till time becomes eternity.


   Well then might Barnabas rejoice,

   And aid the work with heart and voice,

   For though by earth and hell assail'd,

   The truth grew mighty and prevail'd.


   Ye faithful souls, from age to age,

   Transmit your heavenly heritage,

   Christ's easy yoke with meekness wear,

   And bear His cross whose name ye bear:--


   That all the living, in that day,

   When Heaven and Earth must pass away,

   Redeemed from sin, through grace restored,

   May be caught up to meet the Lord.

   From dark temptation's power,

   From Satan's wiles defend,

   Deliver in the evil hour,

   And guide us to the end.


   Thine then ever be

   Glory and power divine;

   The sceptre, throne, and majesty

   Of heaven and earth are thine;

   Thus humbly taught to pray

   By thy beloved Son,

   Through Him we come to Thee, and say

   All for His sake be done!

   The good Providence of the Lord.--Is. cxlvi.


   Praise ye the Lord, from pole to pole!

   Praise thou the Lord, my soul, my soul!

   Long as I live, my voice shall raise,

   My pulse repeat, the song of praise.


   In men, in princes, put no trust:

   Their breath goes forth, they turn to dust;

   Then, fleeting as the flower of grass,

   Perish their thoughts, their glories pass.


   Thrice happy he whose heart can say,

   "The God of Jacob is my stay:

   The Lord of hosts my help shall be,

   Who made the heaven, the earth, the sea."


   The Lord avenges the opprest,

   He sends the wandering stranger rest;

   The Lord unbinds the prisoner's chain,

   He sets the fallen up again.


   The Lord restores the blind to sight,

   Gives strength to them that have no might;

   The Lord relieves in their distress

   The widow and the fatherless.


   The Lord supplies the poor with food,

   He loves to do the righteous good;

   But for the wicked, in his wrath,

   He turns destruction on their path.


   The Lord shall reign for evermore,

   Thy King, O Zion!--Him adore;

   Let unborn generations raise

   To God, thy God, the song of praise.

   Providence and Grace.


   Lord of all power and might!

   All want and weakness we,

   For food and raiment, life and light,

   Daily look up to Thee.


   Thy providence commands

   The blessing from above

   Upon the labours of our hands,

   And offices of love.


   When low by sickness brought,

   Through frailty of the flesh,

   Amidst the travail of our thought,

   Thy comforts us refresh.


   In darkness though we stray,

   Where tempted saints have trod,

   'Tis good for us, like them to stay

   Our souls upon our God.


   In Thee we live and move,

   And have our being still;

   So teach Thou us, to know and prove,

   To choose and do Thy will.


   Thy word, which cannot fail,

   Thy strength, in weakness shown,

   Thy grace, which ever must prevail,

   Shall make Thy glory known.


   That glory be our aim,

   Our hope and crown of joy;

   And to extol Thy holy name,

   Our first, last, sole employ.

   The Lighthouse.


   The lighthouse founded on a rock,

   Casts o'er the flood its radiant eye,

   Firm amidst ocean's heaviest shock,

   Serene beneath the stormiest sky.


   Though winds and waters rage and foam,

   Though darkness lowers like Egypt's night,

   Here peace and safety find a home;

   In this small Goshen there is light.


   Nor for itself it stands alone,

   The seaman's friend, it shines from far,

   As though an angel from the throne

   Came down to be his leading star.


   It warns to shun the breakers near,

   Smooth into port the vessel guides,

   Points where a wider course to steer,

   Shows how to 'scape conflicting tides.


   Thus built upon eternal truth,

   High in mid-heaven o'er land and sea,

   Christ's Church holds forth to age and youth

   A beacon and a sanctuary.


   Light, peace, and safety dwell within,

   Abroad its sunbright beams display,

   Clear from the rocks and shoals of sin,

   Through life and death, the one good way.

   Choosing the Better Part.


   The one thing needful be our choice,

   To sit at our Redeemer's feet;

   And meekly hearken to His voice,

   That still small voice divinely sweet.


   Divinely sweet, and yet of power

   To quell the tempest, calm the waves,

   And even in His expiring hour

   To rend the rocks, unclose the graves.


   "Come unto me, all ye that mourn,

   Weary, hard laden, sore opprest;

   Your griefs and sorrows I have borne,

   O come, and I will give you rest!"


   For us heaven's glory He forsook;

   To seek and save the lost he came;

   Himself our feeble nature took,

   Endured the cross, despised the shame,


   And shall we not for Him forsake

   Earth's toys, sin's bondage, Satan's snare,

   His cross, an easy yoke, to take,

   His shame, a burthen light, to bear?


   Ah! then be ours that better part,

   Which Mary chose, His words to hear,

   And bide as treasures in our heart,

   Dearer than life itself is dear.

   God's merciful Guardianship of his People.--Ps. xci.


   Call Jehovah thy salvation,

   Rest beneath the Almighty's shade,

   In his secret habitation

   Dwell, and never be dismay'd:

   There no tumult shall alarm thee,

   Thou shalt dread no hidden snare,

   Guile nor violence can harm thee

   In eternal safeguard there.


   From the sword at noon-day wasting,

   From the noisome pestilence,

   In the depth of midnight blasting,

   God shall be thy sure defence;

   Fear not thou the deadly quiver,

   When a thousand feel the blow,

   Mercy shall thy soul deliver,

   Though ten thousand be laid low.


   Only with thine eyes the anguish

   Of the wicked thou shalt see,

   When by slow disease they languish,

   When they perish suddenly:

   Thee, though winds and waves be swelling,

   God, thine hope, shall bear through all;

   Plague shall not come nigh thy dwelling,

   Thee no evil shall befall.


   He shall charge his angel legions,

   Watch and ward o'er thee to keep;

   Though thou walk through hostile regions,

   Though in desert wilds thou sleep:

   On the lion vainly roaring,

   On his young, thy foot shall tread,

   And, the dragon's den exploring,

   Thou shalt bruise the Serpent's head.


   Since, with pure and firm affection,

   Thou on God hast set thy love,

   With the wings of His protection

   He will shield thee from above:

   Thou shalt call on Him in trouble,

   He will hearken, He will save,

   Here for grief reward thee double,

   Crown with life beyond the grave.

   Acknowledgment that Divine Providence chooses our Lot.


   Father of lights! from whom alone,

   All good and perfect gifts descend;

   To Thee our utmost wants are known,

   To us Thy benefits extend.


   Thy power, thy wisdom, and thy grace

   Bestow'd our being, life, and breath,

   Fix'd our condition, time and place,

   The moment of our birth--our death.


   Though poor our lot, Thou didst not leave

   Thy children in their low estate,

   In helpless misery to grieve,

   Or frolic on the brink of fate.


   Thy servants took us by the hand,

   Led to the school, the church, and Thee;

   Surely in Britain's chosen land,

   A goodly heritage have we.


   O may we know in this our day,

   The things of our eternal peace!

   From strength to strength pursue our way

   In faith and holiness increase.


   Still with long suffering, goodness, truth,

   Conduct us through this vale of tears;

   With loving-kindness guard our youth,

   With tender mercies crown our years.

   We pass through deeper night.


   Their tasks the heavenly hosts fulfil,

   Thine eyes observe my ways!"

   Our hearts are Thine, we own the debt--

   Happy the child that pays!


   But Lord! we cannot give, unless

   Thou take what is Thine own;

   Come, then, our conquer'd hearts possess,

   In each erect Thy throne.


   There wield Thy sceptre, Prince of Peace,

   With kind and gentle sway,

   And may Thy kingdom still increase,

   While Satan's falls away.


   Where sin abounded, there let grace

   Abound yet more and more,

   Till life and freedom take the place

   Of bonds and death before.


   Thy word our law, Thy will our choice,

   Thy fear all fear expel;

   Thy joy our strength, let us rejoice

   With joy unspeakable.


   And O! to make us wholly thine,

   Thy perfect love impart;

   Thus warm, illumine, raise, refine,

   And hallow every heart.

   The fellowship of those who fear the Lord.--Malachi iii. 16-18; iv. 1.


   When those who fear'd the Lord of old

   Met oft, and spoke with one accord,

   A book was written, and enroll'd

   Their faithful names before the Lord.


   They shall be mine, Jehovah said,

   And as a signet on my hand,

   A crown of glory for my head,

   Among my chosen jewels stand.


   And I will spare them in that day,

   Even as a father spares his son,

   When all the proud are swept away,

   The wicked, root and branch, undone.


   Then shall my righteousness be shown;

   Then, by their good or evil lot,

   The sinner and the saint be known,

   Who served the Lord, who served Him not.


   Lord, we are taught Thy name to fear,

   O may we tremble to offend;

   Lord, we are taught to serve Thee here,

   May we be faithful to the end.


   Our names are on Thy Church's rolls,

   But in Thy book our pardon write:

   Rich was the ransom of our souls,

   May they be precious in Thy sight.

   Or enter not His joy.


   The night will come full soon,

   While many a sun goes down ere noon

   Few to their west descend.


   Lord, Christ, we humbly ask

   Of Thee the power and will,

   With fear and meekness, every task

   Of duty to fulfil.


   Our own salvation be

   Our first and constant aim,

   Then far and wide, o'er land and sea,

   At home by word and deed,

   Adorn redeeming grace,

   And sow abroad the precious seed

   Of truth in every place.


   That thus the wilderness

   May blossom like the rose,

   And trees spring up of righteousness,

   Where'er life's river flows.

   The wisdom from above impart,

   To keep our hand, and tongue, and heart,

   Christ in various Characters.


   Father! reveal Thy Son in me,

   To my soul's eye, unclouded;

   The fulness of the Deity,

   In mortal semblance shrouded,

   When, for a Name o'er every Name,

   He bore the Cross, despised the shame,

   And rose--the World's Redeemer.


   Him then as mine may I confess,

   With all my powers adore Him,

   And, as the Lord my Righteousness,

   Most humbly walk before Him,

   Hail Him, mine Advocate, on high,

   Extol His Priesthood, and rely

   Upon His sole atonement.


   All things for Him may I forsake;

   In poverty and weakness,

   His gentle burthen on me take,

   And wear His yoke with meekness;

   So shall I find in labour rest,

   In suffering, peace,--of Christ possess'd

   In me the hope of glory.

   Renewal in the Image of Christ.


   Dust and ashes, sin and guilt,--

   Christ, for me Thy blood was spilt;

   Cleanse Thou me from guilt and sin,

   Make Me pure without, within;

   Soul and body, at Thy word,

   Be to saving health restored.


   Flesh and blood, this mortal frame;

   Thou wert pleased to wear the same;

   Though Thy nature was divine,

   Thou didst condescend to mine;

   Let me, for Thy mercy's sake,

   Thy divinity partake.


   From the ruins of the fall,

   Me to grace and glory call:

   Me, O Lord my Righteousness!

   With Thine image re-impress;

   Thou didst stoop to earth for me;

   Raise me up to heaven with Thee.

   The Walk of Faith.


   Humbly, my God, with Thee I walk,

   And sweet communion hold;

   With Thee in my soul's silence talk,

   And all my heart unfold.


   But what a heart for Thee to look

   Into its depths, and read,

   As in the volume of a book,

   The thoughts which thence proceed!


   Its vain imaginations, vain

   Affections and desires,

   Its thirst for glory, grandeur, gain,

   False hopes, false fears, false fires:--


   These would I not from Thee conceal,

   Nor thus myself deceive;

   No, grant me, Lord, my sins to feel,

   To feel them and to grieve:--


   Grieve, and with penitence confess,

   Till Thou art pleased to show

   Mercy on my unrighteousness,

   And give me joy for woe.


   How blest my lot no tongue can tell,

   if such my walk might be,

   As seeing Thee, invisible,

   For ever seeing me.

   The Surrender of the Heart.


   Upon Thine altar, Lord, I lay

   My poor, my only sacrifice;

   Thou wilt not turn Thy face away,

   Wilt not a broken heart despise.


   Though hard as stone, cold as the clod,

   Mine,--for Thy tender mercles' sake,

   Not with the vengeance of Thy rod,

   But by thy loving-kindness break,


   Break it, and bind it, wound and heal,

   Yea kill to make alive again;

   Impress it with Thy Spirit's seal,

   The sacrifice were perfect then:--


   Perfect, yet all unworthy still:

   But while in Jesus I believe,

   Who came on earth to do Thy will,

   From His dear hands my gift receive.


   Receive it, with His blood bedew'd,

   Receive it, offer'd with His prayers,

   And, in Thine image thus renew'd,

   Enroll me with Thy kingdom's heirs.

   Self-Knowledge.


   Thine eye, Lord God, alone can see

   The soul through every secret part;

   The mystery of iniquity

   Hid in the hollow of man's heart.


   Myself unto myself reveal,

   Light let me see in Thy pure light;

   The eye of unbelief unseal,

   Change doubt to faith, and faith to sight:


   By inward vision to discern

   The misery of my fall'n estate,

   And from that sad disclosure learn

   Life's hardest lesson, ere too late:--


   Life's hardest lesson, but its best!

   The source of all my ills to trace

   Through the dark windings of my breast,

   Or in the world's deceitful face.


   How long, how far on pilgrimage

   To Zion have I feign'd to go,

   Yet went astray at every stage,

   Snared or smit down by every foe!


   Now, a poor way-worn traveller,

   With slower speed, and failing strength

   At every step I fear to err,

   And be a cast-away at length.


   Thou Light, that lightenest every one

   Who toils through this bewildering path,

   Shine on my soul, that I may shun

   The broad, dark, downward road to wrath.


   So let that narrow path be mine,

   Which, level as the morning ray,

   Like it, shall upward tend, and shine,

   From earth's faint dawn to Heaven's full day.

   Self-discoveries.


   Lord, when we search the human heart,

   We find a fallen world within;

   There is no health in any part,

   Sin reigns throughout, and death by sin.


   Large provinces are pagan still,

   Where other lords dominion share;

   Idols of mind, affection, will,

   The Power of darkness triumphs there.


   Here, the false prophet's wild domains,

   Where Lust, and Cruelty, and Hate,

   With baleful passions fire the veins,

   And seal the conscience up in fate.


   'Midst all, the stubborn, stiff-necked Jew,

   Blind, like his kindred, prone to roam,

   Denies the Saviour whom he slew,

   Mammon his God, and earth his home.


   The smallest portion of the whole

   Some beams of heavenly truth pervade;

   Slowly the day-spring o'er the soul

   Breaks through the fogs of nature's shade.


   I know a bosom, which within

   Contains the world's sad counterpart;

   'Tis here,--the reign of death and sin;

   O God! evangelize my heart!


   Then will I strive through earth's whole round,

   Thy name, Thy knowledge to diffuse;

   And send the Gospel's joyful sound

   To Pagans, Infidels, and Jews.


   From Christian hearts divinely changed,

   Were the world's likeness thus to part,

   That world, from God no more estranged,

   Would soon be like the Christian's heart.

   "I have sinned against the Lord."--


   I left the God of truth and light,

   I left the God who gave me breath,

   To wander in the wilds of night,

   And perish in the snares of death.


   Sweet was His service, and His yoke

   Was light and easy to be borne;

   Through all His bands of love I broke,

   I cast away His gifts with scorn.


   I danced in folly's giddy maze,

   And drank the sea, and chased the wind;

   But falsehood lurk'd in all her ways,

   Her laughter left remorse behind.


   I dream'd of bliss in pleasure's bowers,

   While pillowing roses stayed my head;

   But serpents hiss'd among the flowers;

   I woke, and thorns were all my bed.


   In riches, when I sought for joy,

   And placed in sordid gain my trust,

   I found that gold was all alloy,

   And worldly treasure--fleeting dust.


   I woo'd ambition, climb'd the pole,

   And shone among the stars,--but fell,

   Headlong in all my pride of soul,

   Like Lucifer, from heaven to hell.


   Heart-broken, friendless, poor, cast down,

   Where shall the chief of sinners fly,

   Almighty Vengeance! from thy frown--

   Eternal Justice! from thine eye?


   Lo, through the gloom of guilty fears,

   My faith discerns a dawn of grace;

   The Sun of Righteousness appears

   In Jesus' reconciling face.


   My suffering, slain, and risen Lord,

   In sore distress I turn to Thee,

   I claim acceptance on Thy word,

   My God! my God! forsake not me.


   Prostrate before the mercy seat,

   I dare not, if I would, despair;

   None ever perish'd at Thy feet,

   And I will lie for ever there.

   God! be merciful to me,

   For my spirit trusts in Thee,

   And to Thee, her refuge springs:

   Be the shadow of thy wings

   Round the trembling sinner cast,

   Till this storm is overpast.


   From the water-floods that roll

   Deep and deeper round my soul,

   Me, Thine arm Almighty take,

   For thy loving-kindness' sake;

   If Thy truth from me depart,

   Thy rebuke will break my heart.


   Foes increase, they close me round,

   Friend nor comforter is found;

   Sore temptations now assail,

   Hope and strength and courage fail;

   Turn not from Thy servant's grief,

   Hasten, Lord, to my relief.


   Poor and sorrowful am I,

   Set me, O my God! on high:

   Wonders Thou for me hast wrought;

   Nigh to death my soul is brought;

   Save me, Lord, in mercy save,

   Lest I sink below the grave.

   Jesus! Redeemer! show thy face

   In mercy, or I die.


   Save me, for none beside can save;

   At thy command I tread,

   With failing step, life's stormy wave;

   The wave goes o'er my head.


   I perish, and my doom were just;

   But wilt thou leave me? No:

   I hold Thee fast, my hope, my trust,

   I will not let Thee go.


   Still sure to me Thy promise stands,

   And ever must abide;

   Behold it written on Thy hands,

   And graven in Thy side.


   To this, this only, will I cleave,

   Thy word is all my plea;

   Thy word is truth, and I believe:

   Have mercy, Lord, on me.

   Faithful hast ever proved,

   And faithful to eternity,

   Thy word of promise stands to me.


   "That blessed word I prove,

   I know Thee as Thou art;

   Thy kindness will not move,

   Nor can Thy truth depart;

   With me, Thy covenant of peace

   Is seal'd, is sure, and shall not cease."


   Thus may the mourner say

   In the dark hour of grief,

   When the first trembling ray

   Of comfort darts relief

   Into the dungeon of his soul,

   Till love, joy, peace, illume the whole.


   Down, then, the dungeon falls,

   A palace straight upsprings,

   Salvation guards the walls,

   And lo! the King of kings

   Enters with all his glorious train,

   For ever in that soul to reign.

   His own Son my soul to save,

   And sends down, in love divine,

   His good Spirit to strive with mine.


   I will love the Son; for He

   Loved, and gave Himself for me;

   I will love Him on his cross,

   And for Him count all things loss;

   I will love Him on his throne,

   When I know as I am known.


   I will love the Spirit; for He

   Deigns in love to dwell with me;

   I will love Him on my knees,

   Helping mine infirmities,

   Till my joyful lips record

   "Abba, Father!" "Jesus, Lord!"


   Thee, o'er all for ever blest,

   One, true, only God confest,

   I would love, with heart and mind,

   Soul and strength;--but what can bind,

   O my God! my love to thee!

   This alone, Thy love to me.

   Earnest Supplication, under Trials of Faith.--Ps. cxliii.


   Hear me, O Lord! in my distress,

   Hear me in truth and righteousness;

   For, at Thy bar of judgment tried,

   None living can be justified.


   Lord! I have foes without, within,

   The world, the flesh, indwelling sin,

   Life's daily ills, temptation's power,

   And Satan roaring to devour.


   These, these, my fainting soul surround,

   My strength is smitten to the ground;

   Like those long dead, beneath their weight,

   Crush'd is my heart, and desolate.


   Yet in the gloom of silent thought,

   I call to mind what God hath wrought,

   Thy wonders in the days of old,

   Thy mercies great and manifold.


   Ah! then to Thee I stretch my hands,

   Like fainting streams through desert sands;

   I thirst for thee, as harvest plains,

   Parch'd by the summer, thirst for rains.


   O let me not thus hopeless lie

   Like one condemn'd at morn to die;

   But with the morning may I see

   Thy loving kindness visit me.


   Teach me Thy will, subdue my own;

   Thou art my God, and Thou alone,

   By Thy good Spirit guide me still,

   Safe from all foes, to Zion's Hill.


   Release my soul from trouble, Lord,

   Quicken and keep me by Thy word;

   May all its promises be mine!

   Thou art my portion,--I am Thine.

   In prayer before His feet!


   Not with the thunder of Thy power

   Wouldst Thou against me plead;

   No, Thy good Spirit, in that hour,

   Thy well-beloved Son;

   Father! Thou couldst not turn away

   From Thine anointed One.


   Thine own unutterable grace,

   Thy love,--Thy love to me,

   Constrain me thus to seek Thy face,

   And cast my cares on Thee.


   Hear, then the voice of my desire,

   My griefs, my fears behold;

   Search me and try me, as with fire,

   And bring me forth like gold.


   Lord! thou hast troubled my repose,

   Thy chastisements I feel;

   Thine hand hath touch'd my heart--it glows,

   It melts,--impress Thy seal.

   Their rounds of glory run,

   Where science leads thee to explore

   In every star a sun.


   Thus, when some long-loved comfort ends,

   And frailty would despair,

   Faith to the heaven of heavens ascends,

   And meets ten thousand there.

   In spirit when I took my flight

   Above the mount, to see

   My Lord, transfigured in the light

   Of His own Deity:--


   I cried, not knowing what I said,

   "'Tis good to tarry here!"

   But, when the heavenly vision fled,

   Transport gave way to fear.


   No longer counting all things loss,

   To glory in His name,

   I thought it hard to bear the cross,

   Hard to despise the shame.


   Ah! thus, my soul, it should not be;

   Lord Jesus! hear my prayer;

   Give me a heart to follow Thee

   All times, and every where.


   Let but Thy presence with me go,

   Thy love be my delight,

   Then shall I walk, through weal or woe,

   By faith, and not by sight.

   Where are the vows which then I vow'd,

   (A Sabbath Meditation in a Sick Chamber.)


   Thousands, O Lord of Hosts! this day,

   Around Thine altar meet;

   And tens of thousands throng to pay

   Their homage at Thy feet.


   They see Thy power and glory there,

   As I have seen them too;

   They read, they hear, they join in prayer,

   As I was wont to do.


   They sing Thy deeds, as I have sung

   In sweet and solemn lays;

   Were I among them, my glad tongue

   Might learn new themes of praise.


   For Thou art in their midst to teach

   When on Thy name they call,

   And Thou hast blessings, Lord, for each,--

   Hast blessings, Lord, for all.


   I, of such fellowship bereft,

   In spirit turn to Thee;

   Oh! hast not Thou a blessing left,

   A blessing, Lord, for me?


   The dew lies thick on all the ground;

   Shall my poor fleece be dry?

   The manna rains from heaven around;

   Shall I of hunger die?


   Behold Thy prisoner;--loose my bands,

   If 'tis Thy gracious will:

   If not,--contented in Thy hands,

   Behold Thy prisoner still!


   I may not to Thy courts repair,

   Yet here Thou surely art;

   Lord, consecrate an house of prayer

   In my surrender'd heart.


   To faith reveal the things unseen,

   To hope the joys untold;

   Let love, without a veil between,

   Thy glory now behold.

   'Tis not the bleeding wounds of grief,

   Whose anguish I bemoan;

   An evil heart of unbelief,

   A cold, hard heart of stone;--


   O'er this, in loneliness, I wake,

   And darkness to be felt,

   Since Sinai's thunders cannot break,

   Nor Calvary's sufferings melt.


   Uncheer'd with hopes, unawed by fears,

   All comfort banish'd hence,

   O for one grain of saving faith,

   Upspringing in my breast!

   Despondency Self-Corrected.--Ps. lxxvii.


   In time of tribulation,

   Hear, Lord, my feeble cries,

   With humble supplication

   To Thee my spirit flies:

   My heart with grief is breaking,

   Scarce can my voice complain;

   Mine eyes, with tears kept waking,

   Still watch and weep in vain.


   The days of old, in vision,

   Bring vanish'd bliss to view;

   The years of lost fruition

   Their joys in pangs renew;

   Remember'd songs of gladness,

   Through night's lone silence brought,

   Strike notes of deeper sadness,

   And stir desponding thought.


   Hath God cast off for ever?

   Can time His truth impair?

   His tender mercy, never

   Shall I presume to share?

   Hath He His loving-kindness

   Shut up in endless wrath?

   No;--this is my own blindness,

   That cannot see His path.


   I call to recollection

   The years of His right hand,

   And, strong in His protection,

   Again through faith I stand:

   Thy deeds, O Lord! are wonder,

   Holy are all Thy ways,

   The secret place of thunder

   Shall utter forth Thy praise.


   Thee, with the tribes assembled,

   O God! the billows saw;

   They saw Thee, and they trembled,

   Turn'd, and stood still with awe:

   The clouds shot hail--they lighten'd,

   The earth reel'd to and fro;

   The fiery pillar brighten'd

   The gulph of gloom below.


   Thy way is in great waters,

   Thy footsteps are not known;

   Let Adam's sons and daughters

   Confide in Thee alone:

   Through the wild sea Thou leddest

   Thy chosen flock of yore;

   Still on the waves Thou treadest,

   And Thy redeem'd pass o'er.

   "Sweet is Thy mercy, O my God!"

   'Tis transport to repeat,

   When Thou hast thrown aside the rod,

   "Thy mercy, Lord, is sweet!"

   Trust in the Lord.


   God is my strong salvation,

   What foe have I to fear?

   In darkness and temptation,

   My light, my help is near:

   Though hosts encamp around me,

   Firm to the fight I stand:

   What terror can confound me,

   With God at my right hand?


   Place on the Lord reliance,

   My soul, with courage wait;

   His truth be thine affiance,

   When faint and desolate:

   His might thine heart shall strengthen,

   His love thy joy increase;

   Mercy thy days shall lengthen,

   "The Lord will give thee peace."

   Thanksgiving for Deliverance from Trouble.--Ps. xxx.


   Yea, I will extol Thee

   Lord of life and light,

   For Thine arm upheld me,

   Turn'd my foes to flight;

   I implored Thy succour,

   Thou wert swift to save,

   Heal my wounded spirit,

   Bring me from the grave.


   Sing, ye saints, sing praises!

   Call His love to mind,

   For a moment angry,

   But for ever kind;

   Grief may, like a stranger,

   Through the night sojourn,

   Yet shall joy, to-morrow,

   With the sun return.


   In my wealth I vaunted,

   "Nought shall move me hence;

   Thou hast made my mountain,

   Strong in Thy defence:"--

   Then Thy face was hidden,

   Trouble laid me low,

   "Lord," I cried right humbly,

   "Why forsake me so?"


   "Would my blood appease Thee,

   In atonement shed?

   Can the dust give glory?--

   Praise employ the dead?

   Hear me, Lord, in mercy,

   God my Helper, hear."

   --Long Thou didst not tarry,

   Help and health were near.


   Thou hast turn'd my mourning

   Into minstrelsy,

   Girded me with gladness,

   Set from thraldom free:

   Thee my ransom'd powers

   Henceforth shall adore,

   Thee, my great Deliverer,

   Laud for evermore.

   "Lovest thou Me?--John, xxi. 15-17.


   "Lovest thou Me?" I hear my Saviour say;

   Would that my heart had power to answer "Yea,"

   Thou knowest all things, Lord, in heaven above,

   And earth beneath; Thou knowest that I love."


   But 'tis not so; in word, in deed, in thought,

   I do not, cannot love Thee as I ought;

   Thy love must give that power, Thy love alone;

   There's nothing worthy of Thee but Thine own.


   Lord, with the love wherewith Thou lovest me,

   Reflected on Thyself, I would love Thee;

   Thence on my brethren shed, might it be seen

   By all around, that I with Thee had been.

   For Divine Protection on a Day's Journey.


   I take the journey of a day,

   Thy sun, Lord, gives me light;

   The moon and stars, Thy voice obey,

   And watch me through the night.


   For mercies every hour bestow'd

   Unceasing thanks are due;

   Now, 'midst the dangers of the road,

   Lord, bring me safely through.


   Upheld by Thine Almighty arm,

   And guided by Thine eye,

   Storms cannot crush, nor lightnings harm,

   Sickness nor plague come nigh.


   Thou art Thy people's sun and shield,

   Their glory and defence;

   All elements allegiance yield

   To sovereign Providence.


   But not in Providence alone

   The Godhead's footsteps shine,

   In grace are mightier wonders shown,

   Of love and power divine.


   As these thus far on pilgrimage,

   My lengthen'd course attend,

   So may they lead me stage by stage,

   To mine appointed end.


   When all my journeyings here must cease,

   And life no more shall be;

   Lord, let me then depart in peace,

   From every thing but Thee.

   Prayers on Pilgrimage.


   I.

      In the hour of trial,

      Jesus, pray for me,

      Lest, by base denial,

      I depart from Thee

      When Thou seest me waver,

      With a look recall,

      Nor, for fear or favour,

      Suffer me to fall.


      With its witching pleasures,

      Would this vain world charm,

      Or its sordid treasures,

      Spread to work me harm;

      Bring to my remembrance

      Sad Gethsemane,

      Or, in darker semblance,

      Cross-crown'd Calvary.


      If, with sore affliction,

      Thou in love chastise,

      Pour Thy benediction

      On the sacrifice;

      Then, upon Thine altar,

      Freely offer'd up,

      Though the flesh may falter.

      Faith shall drink the cup.


      When in dust and ashes,

      To the grave I sink,

      While heaven's glory flashes

      O'er the shelving brink,

      On Thy truth relying,

      Through that mortal strife,

      Lord, receive me, dying,

      To eternal life.

      Blessed be Thy name,

      Jesus Christ!--the same

      Yesterday, to-day, for ever,

      What from Thee my soul shall sever,

      While I hear Thy voice,

      And in Thee rejoice?


      Guide me with Thine eye;

      Warn to fight or fly,

      When the foe, a lion raging,

      Or, with serpent guile assuaging,

      Comes in wrath to tear,

      Or by fraud ensnare.


      Hold me with Thine hand,

      For by faith I stand;

      On Thy strength my sole reliance,

      In Thy truth my whole affiance;

      Then where'er I roam,

      I am travelling home.


      Lord, Thy word is light;

      Led by it aright,

      When a pilgrim, like my Fathers,

      Life's last shadow round me gathers,

      May its brightening ray

      Shine to perfect day.


      With my latest breath,

      Overcoming death,

      From the body disencumber'd

      With thy Saints in glory number'd,

      Jesus, may I be

      Found in peace with Thee.

   "He that overcomes through me,

   What an heritage were this!

   An eternity of bliss,

   Heaven below and heaven above,

   O the miracle of love!


   "Abba! Father!" then might I

   Through the Holy Spirit cry;

   Heir of God, with Christ joint-heir,

   Grace and glory call'd to share.


   Can a worm such gifts receive?

   Fear not, faint not, but believe,

   He who gave His Son, shall He

   Any good withhold from thee?


   Know that thus the Father will'd,

   Thus the Son His task fulfill'd,

   That the Holy Ghost might thus

   Though the fields should yield no meat,

   At the shepherd's well-known call:--


   Yet will I in God rejoice,

   In Jehovah I will trust,

   And extol, with heart and voice,

   His salvation from the dust;

   He can all my sickness cure;

   God will give His children bread,

   And their water shall be sure.

   Himself the still small voice made known,

   'Tis like the precious ointment, shed

   'Tis like the dews that fill

   The cups of Hermon's flowers;

   Or Zion's fruitful hill,

   Bright with the drops of showers,

   When mingling odours breathe around,

   And glory rests on all the ground.

   A multitude unknown.


   Life's poor distinctions vanish here;

   To-day the young, the old,

   Our Saviour and His flock appear

   One Shepherd and one fold.


   Toil, trial, suffering, still await

   On earth the pilgrim-throng,

   Yet learn we, in our low estate,

   The Church-triumphant's song.


   "Worthy the Lamb for sinners slain,"

   Cry the redeem'd above,

   "Blessing and honour to obtain,

   And everlasting love."


   "Worthy the Lamb!" on earth we sing,

   "Who died our souls to save;

   Shall send salvation through all lands.


   Thou, by whose word the worlds were made,

   In wisdom and in goodness framed,

   By every creature be obey'd,

   By every tongue Thy praise proclaim'd.


   Let Britain's children, most of all

   Beholden for their lot of grace,

   Rejoice to hear their Saviour's call,

   The Lapse of Time.


   Moments and minutes, hours and days,

   To weeks, and months, and years amount;

   Not one beyond its date delays:

   For these we each must soon account.


   How well, how ill, howe'er employ'd,

   Our health, our strength, our talents lent;

   All we have suffer'd and enjoy'd,

   In wisdom or in folly spent:--


   The secret things in darkness seal'd,

   All we have felt, thought, spoken, done;

   In heaven's pure light must be reveal'd,

   When time's last act puts out the sun.


   With every twinkling of an eye,

   With every step, pulse, motion, breath;

   The longest human life draws nigh,

   And nigher to the gates of death.


   The past we never can recall,

   The present none has power to hold;

   The future is not--few of all

   The millions born on earth grow old.


   What, then, are we, and whither bent?

   Our Saviour calls--let us obey;

   This moment, minute, hour, repent,

   And live for ever from this day.

   What can poor sinners give?

   We meet our Judge, and live.

      And opens earth and sky?


      'Tis thine, my God! the same that kept

      No ill came nigh me, for I slept

      Beneath the Almighty's arm.


      'Tis Thine,--my daily bread that brings,

      Like manna scatter'd round:

      And clothes me, as the lily springs,

      In beauty from the ground.


      This is the hand that shaped my frame,

      And gave my pulse to beat;

      That bare me oft through flood and flame,

      Through tempest, cold, and heat.


      In death's dark valley, though I stray,

      'Twould there my stops attend,

      Under the shadow of Thy wings,

      My weary limbs reposed,

      And, undisturb'd by earthly things,

      A day of labour closed.


      Safe in Thine everlasting arms,

      That compass'd me around,

      Body and soul, from outward harms,

      And inward fears were found.


      Thus, till the morn in beauty broke,

      My sleep was sweet to me;

      Thy voice then call'd me, I awoke,

      And found myself with Thee.


      Humbly beside my couch I knelt,

      And while I strove to pray,

      The earnest in my heart I felt

      Of blessings through the day.


      Oh! oft, to cheer me, to and fro,

   He spake with Abraham at the oak,

   He call'd Elisha from the plough,

   David He from the sheep-folds took;

   Thy day, Thy hour of grace is now.


   Earth, with thy vanities, depart!

   My God, I stand alone with Thee;

   Thine eye is looking on my heart;

   Oh! what a noon is risen on me!


   Struck to the ground, like conscious Saul,

   And blinded with the sudden view,

   Trembling, astonish'd, "Lord," I call,

   What wouldst Thou have Thy servant do?"


   My sins, as fresh-committed, rise;

   My secret sins, by darkness seal'd,

   Before my Judge's flaming eyes,

   Are all in naked guilt reveal'd.


   Lord, lay Thine hand upon my head;

   A touch, a word, will make me whole;

   Speak with the voice that wakes the dead,

   Peace, pardon, comfort, to my soul.


   Then, though I shudder at Thy sight,

   Through Him who my offences bore,

   In light, as God is in the light,

   I walk by faith, and sin no more.

   When meekly offer'd there.


   Though heaven and earth Thy presence fill.

   Thou surely art, O Lord,

   With Him who loves and does Thy will,

   Who hears and keeps Thy word.

   O where shall rest be found,

   Rest for the weary soul?

   'Twere vain the ocean-depths to sound,

   Or pierce to either pole;

   The world can never give

   The bliss for which we sigh;

   'Tis not the whole of life to live;

   Nor all of death to die.


   Beyond this vale of tears,

   There is a life above,

   Unmeasured by the flight of years;

   And all that life is love;--

   There is a death, whose pang

   Ontlasts the fleeting breath;

   O what eternal horrors hang

   Around "the second death!"


   Lord God of truth and grace,

   Teach us that death to shun,

   Lest we be banish'd from Thy face,

   And evermore undone:

   Here would we end our quest;

   Alone are found in Thee,

   The life of perfect love,--the rest

   Of immortality.

   A worm, for what a worm hath done

   Against the Lord of all?

   As fail the waters from the deep,

   As summer-brooks run dry,

   Man lieth down in dreamless sleep,

   His life is vanity.


   Man lieth down, no more to wake,

   Till yonder arching sphere

   Shall, with a roll of thunder, break,

   And nature disappear.

   O hide me, till Thy wrath be past,

   Thou who canst slay or save!

   Hide me, where hope may anchor fast,

   In my Redeemer's grave.

   Past, Present, Future.


   A hundred years ago, not one

   Of us had sprung to birth;

   A hundred years to come, and none

   Can hope to walk this earth.


   We are, we were not! here our mind

   Looks round with hopes and fears;

   This point is Time; before, behind,

   Eternity appears.


   'Tis yet, through grace, within our power,

   To choose what we would be;

   On the decision of an hour,

   Depends eternity.


   This hour! this moment, let us take

   The narrow upward path;

   This hour, this moment, all forsake

   The broad down road to wrath.


   O Lord, our Shepherd! lest like sheep,

   Thy children go astray,

   Feed us with knowledge, guide and keep

   Our souls in Thy right way.


   So, when a hundred years are fled,

   Remembering this day's choice,

   On earth, though number'd with the dead,

   In heaven, may we rejoice.

   The Measures of Time.


   A child, a youth, a man,

   The whole of life below!

   Our time a breath, our course a span;

   Whence come we? whither go?


   Whence come we?--From the womb

   Of dark eternity;

   And thither go we, through the tomb,--

   Behold a mystery!


   For though with worms and dust

   His mortal relics lie,

   Death may not hold or harm the just;

   The spirit cannot die.


   On angels' wings afar,

   'Tis, by a path unknown,

   Beyond the range of sun or star,

   Caught up before the throne:--


   At rest in Paradise,

   With Him in bliss to live,

   Who bought it with so great a price,

   Heaven could no higher give:--


   Till at the trumpet's sound,

   When soul and body meet,

   They twain are one again, and found

   In Christ, a saint complete.


   By His good Spirit taught,

   While train'd on earth, may we

   Be thus by grace to glory brought,

   And immortality.

   Man's Birth, Death, and Judgment.


   Nothing into this world we brought,

   And nothing can we take away;

   Oft be the themes of earnest thought,

   Man's birth, man's death, man's judgment-day.


   For each belongs to each of us;

   Time past, time present, time to be,

   To young and old, determine thus

   The issues of eternity,


   All are born poor, howe'er unlike,

   Their lot through life; and all go down

   Poor to the dust:--the darts that strike

   The slave, strike him who wears a crown,


   That name which each on earth has borne,

   Renown'd, inglorious, or obscure,

   E'en from his gravestone shall be worn;

   Nought under heaven can endure.


   In the Lamb's book of life alone,

   The everlasting page records,

   In open view before the throne,

   The names of those who are the Lord's.


   When on the volume of that book

   While small and great are gathered round,

   The Judge of quick and dead shall look,

   Be all our names unblotted found.

   Life with its infinite Alternatives.


   On our span-long pilgrimage,

   Youth, maturity, old age,

   What is life?--a passing breath;

   Time?--a step from birth to death,


   On that step, that breath, that span,

   Hang the destinies of man;

   Not on this poor earth alone,

   But through worlds unseen, unknown.


   Here a paradise of bliss,

   There a bottomless abyss,

   At the saint's or sinner's feet,

   Fraught with joys or terrors meet.


   While we walk by faith below,

   Grace direct the way we go,

   Through thy gloom, Gethsemane!

   O'er thy height, sad Calvary!


   Thus in travelling from afar,

   Be Christ's cross our leading star,

   And His garden-grave our rest,

   When life's sun goes down the west.


   There in hope our dust be found,

   When the years have fill'd their round,

   Sown in weakness, raised with power,

   In the new creation's hour.

   For Old Age.--Ps. lxxi.


   Lord, I have put my trust in Thee,

   Turn not my confidence to shame;

   Thy promise is a rock to me,

   A tower of refuge is Thy name.


   Thou hast upheld me from the womb;

   Thou wert my strength and hope in youth;

   Now trembling, bending o'er the tomb,

   I lean upon Thine arm of truth.


   Though I have long outlived my peers,

   And stand amid the world alone,

   (A stranger left by former years),

   I know my God,--by Him am known.


   Cast me not off in mine old age,

   Forsake me not in my last hour;

   The foe hath not foregone his rage,

   The lion ravins to devour.


   Not far, my God, not far remove:

   Sin and the world still spread their snares,

   Stand by me now, or they will prove

   Too crafty yet for my grey hairs.


   Me through what troubles hast Thou brought,

   Me with what consolations crown'd!

   Now be Thy last deliverance wrought,

   My soul in peace with Thee be found.

   Preparation through Life unto Death.


   The end of all things is at hand,

   Sober, and watchful let us be,

   And firm to our profession stand,

   In faith and hope and charity.


   Satan, our adversary knows

   The limit of his lawless power,

   Yet like a roaring lion goes

   Forth, seeking whom he may devour.


   The shield of faith then let us take;

   From his assaults to guard our bearts,

   And quench, though from the burning lake,

   The force of all his fiery darts.


   The gospel-hope be, too, our stay,

   When doubt and unbelief prevail,

   Our comfort in the evil day,

   Our strength when flesh and spirit fail.


   And charity, that bond of peace,

   The source and soul of pure delights,

   Sweet charity, that shall not cease,

   But man with God, through Christ, unites:--


   That holiest unction from above

   Be shed on our affections here,

   Till all are perfected in love,

   And perfect love hath cast out fear.

   The Flight of Time an incentive to Religious Diligence.


   To-day is added to our time,

   Yet while we sing, it glides away;

   How soon shall we be past our prime;

   For where, alas! is yesterday?


   Gone--gone into eternity:

   There, every day in turn appears;

   Tomorrow--O 'twill never be,

   If we should live a thousand years!


   Our time is all to-day, to-day,

   The same, though changed;--and while it flies,

   With still small voice the moments say--

   "To-day, to-day, be wise, be wise!"


   Then wisdom from above impart,

   Lord God! send forth Thy light and truth,

   To guide our feet, inform our heart,

   The Body dies; the Soul suffers no Decay.


   Time grows not old with length of years;

   Changes he brings but changes not;

   New born each moment he appears;

   We run our race, and are forgot.


   Stars in perennial rounds return,

   As from eternity they came,

   And to eternity might burn;

   We are not for one hour the same.


   Spring flowers renew their glad perfume,

   But ere a second spring they fly;

   Our life is longer than their bloom,

   Our bloom is sweeter,--yet we die.


   Stars, like Spring-flowers, shall pass away;

   Time, like the stars, must cease to roll;

   We have what never can decay,--

   Like flowers and stars and time,--a soul.


   Lord God! when time shall end his flight,

   Stars set and flowers revive no more;

   May we behold Thy face in light,

   Thy love in Jesus Christ adore.

   The Value of a Moment.


   At every motion of our breath,

   Life trembles on the brink of death,

   A taper's flame that upward turns,

   While downward to the dust it burns.


   A moment usher'd us to birth,

   Heirs to the commonwealth of earth;

   Moment by moment years are past,

   And one ere long will be our last.


   'Twixt that, long fled, which gave us light,

   And that which soon shall end in night,

   There is a point no eye can see,

   Yet on it hangs eternity.


   This is that moment,--who can tell

   Whether it leads to heaven or hell?

   This is that moment,--as we choose,

   The immortal soul we save or lose.


   Time past and time to come are not;

   Time present is our only lot;

   O God! henceforth our hearts incline

   To seek no other love than thine.

   Translation of a paraphrase of part of chap. xxxi. of Jeremiah, by the
   late Felix Neff, Pastor of the High Alps: sung at his bedside, a little
   before his death, by some of his friends.


   Weep no more, Zion, dry thy streaming tears,

   The Eternal is thy God, dismiss thy fears;

   Rest in the land of peace for thee remains,

   Jehovah leads thee, Israel's strength sustains.


   He will restore thee, ev'n as from the dead,

   O'er ruin'd heaps the vine and olive spread;

   He will rebuild, as in thy happiest hours,

   Thy city walls, thy battlements and towers.


   A day will come, a day when from on high,

   Mount Ephraim's watchmen to the tribes shall cry,

   Return, ye rebels; 'tis your Sovereign's will

   That calls you; come and climb his holy hill.


   Rise, unforgotten by thy Lord above,

   He loved thee with an everlasting love;

   That love, at trumpet's sound, in joyful throngs,

   Thy sons, O Zion! now extol in songs.

   The Living and the Dead.


   Where are the dead? In heaven or hell,

   Their disembodied spirits dwell;

   Their buried forms in bonds of clay,

   Reserved until the judgment day.


   Who were the dead? The sons of time

   In every age, and state, and clime;

   Renown'd, dishonour'd, or forgot,

   The place that knew them, knows them not.


   Where are the living? on the ground,

   Where prayer is heard, and mercy found;

   Where, in the period of a span,

   The mortal makes the immortal man.


   Who are the living? They whose breath

   Draws every moment nigh to death;

   Of bliss or woe the eternal heirs;

   O what an awful choice is theirs!


   Then timely warn'd, may we begin

   To follow Christ, and flee from sin;

   Daily grow up in Him our Head,

   Lord of the living and the dead.

   Preparation for Heaven.


   Heaven is a place of rest from sin;

   But all who hope to enter there,

   Must here that holy course begin,

   Which shall their souls for rest prepare.


   Clean hearts, O God! in us create,

   Right spirits, Lord, in us renew;

   Commence we now that higher state,

   Now do Thy will as angels do.


   A life in heaven!--O what is this?

   The sum of all that faith believed;

   Fulness of joy, and depths of bliss,

   Unseen, unfathom'd, unconceived.


   While thrones, dominions, princedoms, powers,

   And saints made perfect, triumph thus,

   A goodly heritage is ours,

   There is a heaven on earth for us.


   The Church of Christ, the School of grace,

   The Spirit teaching by the word;

   In those our Saviour's steps we trace,

   By this His living voice is heard.


   Firm in His footsteps may we tread,

   Learn every lesson of his love;

   And be from grace to glory led,

   From heaven below to heaven above.

   Heaven on Earth.


   While through this changing world we roam,

   From infancy to age,

   Heaven is the Christian pilgrim's home,

   His rest at every stage.


   Thither his raptured thought ascends,

   Eternal joys to share;

   There his adoring spirit bends,

   While here be kneels in prayer.


   From earth his freed affections rise

   To fix on things above,

   Where all his hope of glory lies,

   And love is perfect love.


   Oh! there may we our treasures place,

   There let our hearts be found,

   That still where sin abounded, grace

   May more and more abound.


   Henceforth our conversation be

   With Christ before the throne:

   Ere long we eye to eye shall see,

   And know as we are known.

   An Antepast of Heaven.--Psalm xlvi.


   There is a river pure and bright,

   Whose streams make glad the heavenly plains,

   Where, in eternity of light,

   The City of our God remains.


   Built by the word of His command,

   With His unclouded presence blest,

   Firm as His throne, the bulwarks stand;

   There is our home, our hope, our rest.


   Thither let fervent faith aspire;

   Our treasure and our heart be there:

   Oh! for a seraph's wing of fire!

   No,--on the mightier wings of prayer,--


   We reach at once that last retreat,

   And, ranged among the ransom'd throng,

   Fall with the elders at His feet,

   Whose Name alone inspires their song.


   Ah! soon, how soon! our spirits droop;

   Unwont the air of heaven to breathe;

   Yet God, in very deed, will stoop,

   And dwell Himself with men beneath.


   Come to thy living temples, then,

   As in the ancient times appear;

   Let earth be Paradise again,

   And man, O God! thine image here.

   But, with my departing breath,

   I will glory in my God,

   In my Saviour I will trust,

   Strengthen'd by His staff and rod,

   While this body falls to dust.


   Soon on wings, on wings of love,

   My transported soul shall rise,

   Like the home-returning dove,

   Vanishing through boundless skies;

   Then, where death shall be no more,

   Sin nor suffering e'er molest,

   All my days of mourning o'er,

   In his presence I shall rest.

   Lord, till I reach thy holy hill,

   Goodness and mercy guard me still.


   And when I yield this mortal breath,

   How many generations dead

   Dwell in the dust on which we tread!

   How many yet may spring to birth,

   When we are seen no more on earth!


   Till, of past, present and to come,

   Time shall cast up the destined sum,

   And, name by name, through that amount,

   Call every unit to account.


   Where'er ensepulchred they lie,

   Each then must answer, "Here am I!"

   And once, but once, all Adam's race

   Meet for a moment face to face.


   Then shall the King on either side,

   As sheep from goats, the throng divide,

   And those to bliss, and these to woe,

   Rejoicing or lamenting go.


   How small to that assembly this!

   Yet heirs like them of woe or bliss:

   Were the last trumpet now to sound,

   On whether hand should we be found?


   "Guilty" we plead, O Judge of all!

   Guilty into Thine hands we fall;

   The friend of sinners still art Thou;

   Save or we perish, save us now!

   At Home in Heaven--1 Thess. iv. 17.


   I.

      "For ever with the Lord!"

      Amen; so let it be;

      Life from the dead is in that word,

      'Tis immortality.


      Here in the body pent,

      Absent from Him I roam,

      Yet nightly pitch my moving tent

      A day's march nearer home.


      My Father's house on high,

      Home of my soul, how near,

      At times, to faith's foreseeing eye

      Thy golden gates appear!


      Ah! then my spirit faints

      To reach the land I love,

      The bright inheritance of saints,

      Jerusalem above.


      Yet clouds will intervene,

      And all my prospect flies,

      Like Noah's dove, I flit between

      Rough seas and stormy skies.


      Anon the clouds depart,

      The winds and waters cease,

      While sweetly o'er my gladden'd heart,

      Expands the bow of peace.


      Beneath its glowing arch,

      Along the hallow'd ground,

      I see cherubic armies march,

      A camp of fire around.


      I hear at morn and even,

      At noon and midnight hour,

      The choral harmonies of heaven,

      Earth's Babel-tongues o'erpower.


      Then, then I feel that He,

      (Remember'd or forgot,)

      The Lord, is never far from me,

      Though I perceive Him not.


   II.

      In darkness as in light,

      Hidden alike from view,

      I sleep, I wake, as in His sight,

      Who looks all nature through.


      All that I am, have been,

      All that I yet may be,

      He sees at once, as He hath seen,

      And shall for ever see.


      How can I meet His eyes?

      Mine on the cross I cast,

      And own my life a Saviour's prize,

      Mercy from first to last.


      "For ever with the Lord!"

      --Father, if 'tis Thy will,

      The promise of that faithful word,

      Even here to me fulfil.


      Be thou at my right hand,

      Then can I never fail;

      Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand,

      Fight, and I must prevail.


      So when my latest breath

      Shall rend the veil in twain,

      By death I shall escape from death,

      And life eternal gain.


   III.

      Knowing as I am known,

      How shall I love that word,

      And oft repeat before the Throne,

      "For ever with the Lord!"


      Then, though the soul enjoy

      Communion high and sweet,

      While worms this body must destroy,

      Both shall in glory meet.


      The trump of final doom

      Will speak the selfsame word,

      And Heaven's voice thunder through the tomb,

      "For ever with the Lord!"


      The tomb shall echo deep

      That death-awakening sound;

      The saints shall hear it in their sleep,

      And answer from the ground.


      Then, upward as they fly,

      That resurrection-word,

      Shall be their shout of victory,

      "For ever with the Lord!"


      That resurrection-word,

      That shout of victory,

      Once more,--"For ever with the Lord!"

      Amen; so let it be!

   When the overwhelming waters

   Once a world of sinners drown'd,

   Eight of Adam's sons and daughters,

   In the Ark salvation found:

   Gather'd to the Church, may we

   Thus from wrath and peril flee.


   When the fire from God descended

   On the cities of the plain,

   Three alone, by Heaven befriended,

   Refuge did in Zoar gain:

   By our pastors led, may we

   Thus escape to Calvary.


   When the midnight angel number'd

   Egypt's first-born with the dead,

   Israel's tribes, unsmitten slumber'd,

   Where the paschal lamb had bled:

   By the blood of sprinkling, we

   Thus from vengeance are made free.


   When, while quick and dead assemble,

   Flames this universe destroy,

   Though the wicked quake and tremble,

   The Day after Judgment.


   The days and years of time are fled,

   Sun, moon, and stars have shone their last;

   The earth and sea gave up their dead,

   Then vanished at the archangel's blast;

   All secret things have been reveal'd,

   Judgment is pass'd, the sentence seal'd,

   And man to all eternity

   What he is now henceforth must be.


   From Adam to his youngest heir,

   Not one escaped the muster-roll,

   Each, as if he alone were there,

   Stood up, and won or lost his soul;

   These from the Judge's presence go

   Down into everlasting woe;

   Vengeance hath barr'd the gates of hell,

   The scenes within no tongue can tell.


   But lo! far off the righteous pass

   To glory from the King's right hand;

   In silence, on the sea of glass,

   Heaven's numbers without number stand,

   While He who bore the cross lays down

   His priestly robe and victor crown;

   The mediatorial reign complete,

   All things are put beneath His feet.


   Then every eye in Him shall see,

   (While thrones and powers before Him fall,)

   The fulness of the Deity,

   Where God Himself is all in all:

   O how eternity will ring

   With the first note the ransom'd sing!

   While in that strain all voices blend,

   Which once begun shall never end.


   In that unutterable song,

   Shall I employ immortal breath?

   Or, with the wicked borne along,

   For ever die "the second death?"

   Jesus! my life, my light Thou art;

   Thy word is in my month, my heart;

   Lord, I believe,--my spirit save

   From sinking lower than the grave.

   Through their dear Redeemer's might,

   More than conquerors they stand.


   Hunger, thirst, disease unknown,

   On immortal fruits they feed;

   Them, the Lamb amidst the throne,

   Shall to living fountains lead;

   Perfect love dispels all fear,

   And for ever from their eyes,

   God shall wipe away the tear.

   For ever with the Lord.


   Eternity! Eternity!

   That boundless, soundless, tideless, sea,

   Of mysteries the mystery,

   What is Eternity to me?


   Infinite bliss or misery,

   Woe past, woe present, woe to be;

   The fulness of felicity;

   These are Eternity to me.


   Two voices from Eternity!

   A voice from heaven comes down to me,

   A voice from bell breaks dolefully,

   "Life, Death, O Man! are offer'd thee."


   The abyss is moved; even Wrath cries "Flee!"

   The height expands, and Love cries "See

   What God hath here prepared for thee;

   Choose thou thine own Eternity!"

   Good Tidings of Great Joy to all People.


   Angels from the realms of glory,

   Wing your flight o'er all the earth,

   Ye who sang creation's story,

   Now proclaim Messiah's birth;

   Come and worship,

   Worship Christ the new-born King.


   Shepherds, in the field abiding,

   Watching o'er your flocks by night,

   God with man is now residing,

   Yonder shines the infant-light;

   Come and worship,

   Worship Christ the new-born King.


   Sages, leave your contemplations,

   Brighter visions beam afar,

   Seek the great Desire of Nations;

   Ye have seen his natal star;

   Come and worship,

   Worship Christ the new-born King.


   Saints, before the altar bending,

   Watching long in hope and fear,

   Suddenly the Lord descending

   In His temple shall appear;

   Come and worship,

   Worship Christ the new-born King.


   Sinners, wrung with true repentance,

   Doom'd for guilt to endless pains,

   Justice now revokes the sentence,

   Mercy calls you--break your chains;

   Come and worship,

   Worship Christ the new-born King.

   Invitation to the Jews to acknowledge Christ.


   Children of Zion, know your King,

   Your own Messiah hail:

   Hosanna in His temple sing,

   For He hath rent the veil.


   Himself the sacrifice for sin,

   As your High-Priest He died;

   With His own blood, He enter'd in,--

   Behold Him crucified!


   Behold Him on the Mercy-seat,

   High in the holiest place;

   Now cast yourselves before His feet,

   Then rise to see His face.


   That face with reconciling beams

   Shines forth upon you all;

   No longer mourn by Babel's streams,

   He calls you,--hear His call.


   So shall your hearts within you burn;

   While guided by His voice,

   With songs to Zion you return,

   And in your God rejoice.


   At His great name, bow every knee;

   Let every tongue confess

   Christ, whom your fathers slew, is HE,

   The Lord your Righteousness.

   The Restoration of Israel.


   Daughter of Zion, from the dust,

   Exalt thy fallen head;

   Again in thy Redeemer trust,

   He calls thee from the dead.


   Awake, awake, put on thy strength,

   Thy beautiful array;

   The day of freedom dawns at length,

   The Lord's appointed day.


   Rebuild thy walls, thy bounds enlarge,

   And send thy heralds forth;

   Say to the South,--"Give up thy charge,

   And keep not back, O North!"


   They come, they come;--thine exiled bands,

   Where'er they rest or roam,

   Have heard Thy voice in distant lands,

   And hasten to their home.


   Thus, though the universe shall burn,

   And God his works destroy,

   With songs the ransom'd shall return,

   And everlasting joy.

   The Christians' Call to the Gypies.--Isa. xviii. 7.


   Christians.

      Strangers, whence came ye to the West;

      Are ye the offspring of the sun,

      That from his rising to his rest,

      Through every clime he shines on, run?

      So bright of eye, so dark of hue,

      Surely your sire hath look'd on you.


   Gypsies.

      Of higher lineage than the sun,

      (But where our birthplace none can show,)

      His track in heaven, on earth we run,

      From where the waves of Ganges flow,

      Or Nile's mysterious waters well

      From Afric's heart, unsearchable.


      Strangers and pilgrims everywhere,

      In exile through the world we roam,

      Yet catch no breath of natal air,

      Yet find no place that once was home;

      We meet no form to ours akin,

      No door to welcome us within.


      Our fathers came not on the wing,

      Like swallows in their annual round,

      Nor did their field-born households spring

      Like flowers in April, from the ground;

      Although, like flowers, or swallows led,

      They might have risen from the dead:--


      So simultaneously appear'd

      Through many a land, a race, that sought

      Not gold or conquest,--Hoped nor fear'd,

      Weapon nor merchandise they brought;

      But, where sweet spots of way-side green

      Gave sun and shade, their tents were seen.


      Ages since then are worn away,

      And we, instinctively estranged,

      From those with whom we dwell,--as they

      That went before, remain unchanged;

      Subtle though sinful, wild yet tame,

      Looks, language, manners, minds, the same.


      But must we so be born and die?

      Must all our generations pass

      Like clouds that vanish through the sky?

      And single lives, like blades of grass

      At day-break green, with dew-drops fed,

      Ere noon be shorn, by night-fall dead?


   Christians.

      Strangers, we hail you to the west,

      Nameless no more, nor hopeless roam,

      Here seek your hope, here find your rest,

      Our country yours, and yours our home;

      And this our bond of union be,

      Ye are our brethren, yours are we.


      Not Nile nor Ganges gave you birth,

      Your parentage and ours is one;

      Coeval with the heavens and earth,

      The God who spake and it was done;

      In His great name on you we call;

      He is the Father of us all.


      Leave then the wild, the lane, the wood,

      Live not like brutes that perish thus;

      O come, and we will do you good,

      For God hath spoken good to us:

      Come, we will teach you all His ways;

      Come, and let both show forth His praise.


   Gypsies.

      We come, we come, the world forsake;

      With heart, soul, mind, and all their powers,

      Your country and your home we take,

      Your people and your God for ours;

      Resolved with you to live and die,

      Dwell where you dwell, lie where you lie.


   Christians and Gypsies.

      Then, when our bodies, dust to dust,

      And side by side, their Sabbath keep,

      May our free souls among the just

      Watch for that breaking up from sleep,

      When once again, we all shall be,

      Joint heirs of immortality.

   For a Deaf Man.


   To me, though neither voice nor sound,

   From earth or air may come,

   Deaf to the world that brawls around,

   The world to me is dumb.


   Yet may the quick and conscious eye

   Assist the slow dull ear;

   Sight can the signs of thought supply,

   And with a look I hear.


   The song of birds, the water's fall,

   Sweet tones and grating jars,

   Hail, tempest, wind, and thunder,--all

   Are silent as the stars:--


   The stars that on their tranquil way,

   In language without speech,

   The glory of the Lord display,

   And to all nations preach.


   Now, though one outward sense be seal'd,

   The kind remaining four,

   To teach me needful knowledge, yield

   Their earnest aid the more.


   Yet hath mine heart an inward ear,

   Through which its powers rejoice;

   Speak, Lord; and let me love to hear

   Thy Spirit's still small voice.


   So when the Archangel from the ground

   Shall summon great and small,

   The ear now deaf shall hear that sound,

   And answer to the call.

   For Mariners.


   Now weigh the anchor, hoist the sail,

   Launch out upon the pathless peep,

   Resolved, however veers the gale,

   The destin'd port in mind to keep;

   Through all the dangers of the way,

   Deliver us, good Lord, we pray.


   When tempests mingle sea and sky,

   And winds like lions rage and rend,

   Ships o'er the mountain-waters fly,

   Or down unfathom'd depths descend,

   Though skill avail not, strength decay,

   Deliver us, good Lord, we pray.


   If lightnings from embattled clouds

   Strike, or a spark in secret nurst,

   From stem to stern, o'er masts and shrouds,

   Like doomsday's conflagration burst,

   Amid the fire Thy power display,

   Deliver us, good Lord, we pray.


   Through yielding planks, should ocean urge

   Rude entrance, flooding all below,

   Speak, ere we founder in the surge--

   "Thus far, nor farther shall ye go;

   Here, ye proud waves, your fury stay:"

   Deliver us, good Lord, we pray.


   With cordage snapt, and canvas riven,

   Through straits thick-strown with rock and shoal,

   Along some gulph-stream. darkly driven,

   Fast wedged 'midst icebergs at the pole,

   Or on low breakers cast away,

   Deliver us, good Lord, we pray.


   Save, or we perish--calms or storms,

   By day, by night, at home, afar,

   Death walks the waves in all his forms,

   And shoots his darts from every star;

   Want, pain, and woe man's path waylay,

   Deliver us, good Lord, we pray.

   Invocation to Peace.--Phil. iv. 7.


   Peace, that passeth understanding,

   Peace to calm the bosom's strife,

   Peace the winds and waves commanding,

   On this stormy sea of life;

   Peace the wounded spirit healing,

   Peace the love of Christ revealing;

   Peace, O God! Thy peace impart;

   Thou of peace the author art.


   Peace to keep our minds for ever

   In Thy faith, Thy fear, Thy way;

   Peace to keep our hearts, that never

   Thought, desire, nor feeling stray!

   Peace to soothe in every trial,

   Peace to soften self-denial,

   Peace our daily cross to take,

   Grant us, for our Saviour's sake.


   War with all the powers of evil,

   We may every moment wage,

   Yet of world, and flesh, and devil,

   Scorn the friendship, falsehood, rage;

   Though by foes and perils haunted,

   We shall pass unharm'd, undaunted,

   Thy whole armour, while we wear,

   Sword, shield, breast-plate, helm,--all prayer.

   For a Birthday.


   Is this the day that gave me birth?

   Returning year by year,

   Still as a stranger on the earth,

   It finds and leaves me here.


   But oh! the day, the day draws nigh,

   When I must hence depart,

   Leave all things pleasant to the eye,

   Or precious to the heart.


   Where shall my naked spirit then,

   Flee at my latest breath?

   Alas! I must be born again,

   Or die a deadlier death.


   While everlasting ages roll

   Without a change away,

   My ransom'd or my ruin'd soul,

   Shall bless or curse this day.


   Lord Jesus, who Thyself was born

   To live and die for me,

   Thy doctrine may my life adorn,

   Death take me home to Thee.

   For a Friend's Birthday.


   Brother and friend, with heart and voice,

   We greet thee on this festal morn;

   None but the Christian can rejoice

   In deed and truth, that he was born.


   Since to this evil world you came,

   Your heavenly birth-right have you prized?

   In Father, Son, and Spirit's hame,

   Were you not from that world baptized?


   Then dead to sin, alive to God,

   Whate'er you feel, or seek, or do,

   Along the path our Saviour trod,

   Meekly his blessed steps pursue.


   So shall the Father cause his face

   To shine on you while life endures,

   So be the Son's redeeming grace,

   The Holy Ghost's communion, yours.


   So may we all with heart and voice

   Sing at the resurrection morn,

   And through eternity rejoice,

   At God's right hand, that we were born.

   Let us Thy tender mercy prove,

   As Thou art wont, from year to year.


   For year by year, when throngs on throngs,

   Rejoicing to Thy courts repair,

   And pour their souls in fervent prayer:--


   To prayers and songs in sovereign grace,

   A willing ear Thou dost incline,

   And cause the glory of Thy face

   In Christ, on all and each to shine.


   To each and all, this day, anew,

   The tokens of Thy love impart,

   And let Thy blessing fall like dew,

   --Fall on good ground in every heart.


   In every heart Thy word be sown,

   Spring up, and thrive through heat and cold,

   Until it shake like Lebanon,

   With heavenly fruit an hundred fold:--

   On a special Christian Festival Occasion.


   The sun clear-shining after showers

   May his own image view,

   Reflected from a thousand flowers

   In countless drops of dew.


   If then a freshening breeze up-springs,

   Above, around, beneath,

   Like heavenward incense on its wings,

   Their mingled odours breathe.


   So! where the Sun of righteousness

   His cheering radiance sheds,

   Where gracious rains have fall'n to bless

   The Church's garden-beds.


   Christ's ransom'd tribes before him stand,

   With His own glory bright;

   Plants of his heavenly Father's hand

   And children of the light.


   Then should the spirit from above

   A gale of Eden's blow,

   As from a Paradise of love,

   How sweet their spices flow!


   To-day, while thousands meet as one

   In many a holy place,

   May He who is of all the Sun,

   In each his image trace.

   For Christmas.


   Sleep, weary world, and take thy rest,

   Thy countless eye-lids close;

   Shut all thy cares within thy breast,

   For once in peace repose.


   Wake, slumbering world; a midnight cry

   Comes with Almighty breath;

   Wake; thy redemption draweth nigh,

   Rise from the dust of death.


   Yon star, those angels, shepherds, kings,

   A birth from heaven proclaim;

   The Son of God salvation brings,

   Emanuel is His name.


   Gather thy children from afar,

   Of climes and tongues unknown;

   Show them the stable and the star,

   Christ's manger and his throne.


   There, with the Angels, loud and sweet,

   All hearts, all voices blend;

   There, with the shepherds, at his feet,

   All knees, all nations bend.


   There, with the wise men from the East,

   Sinners their offerings bring;

   Each at this altar be a priest,

   And every priest a king.


   For He shall wash them in His blood,

   Shall with His robes array,

   And make them kings and priests to God:

   Lord Jesus, speed the day.

   For a Religious Anniversary.


   Once more, to pay our annual vows,

   We to Thy temple, Lord, repair;

   While every knee before Thee bows,

   And every lip is moved in prayer,

   Send down Thy Spirit from above,

   Thy Holy Spirit, God of love.


   In pentecostal power and grace,

   May He baptize us now with fire,

   With His sweet presence fill the place,

   With faith and hope our hearts inspire,

   Faith, seeing what no eye can see,

   Hope, breathing immortality.


   Through Him to us Thy Son reveal,

   In every form that once he wore,

   When with His blood, our peace to seal,

   Our sins He in His body bore,

   For all a full atonement made,

   For each a priceless ransom paid.


   The helpless child in Bethlehem born,

   Heaven's pilgrim through earth's wilderness,

   The man of sorrows and of scorn,

   Him as our Lord we would confess.

   And nothing know, or seek beside

   Christ Jesus, and Him crucified.


   So may we in His likeness grow,

   God in the flesh made manifest--

   Through whom Thine Image, lost below,

   On souls new-born is reimpress'd;

   No longer kindred to the clod,

   Though sons of Adam, sons of God.

   An Hundred Years ago.

   Hymn for the Centenary of Wesleyan Methodism.


   One song of praise, one voice of prayer,

   Around, above, below;

   Ye winds and waves the burthen bear,

   "An hundred years ago!"


   "An hundred years ago!" What then?

   There rose, the world to bless,

   A little band of faithful men,

   A cloud of witnesses:


   It looked but like a human hand;

   Few welcomed, and none fear'd,

   Yet, as it open'd o'er the land,

   The hand of God appear'd.


   The Lord made bare His holy arm,

   In sight of earth and hell;

   Fiends fled before it with alarm,

   And alien-armies fell.


   God gave the word, and great hath been

   The preachers' company;

   What wonders have our fathers seen!

   What signs their children see!


   One song of praise for mercies past,

   Through all our courts resound;

   One voice of prayer, that to the last,

   Grace may yet more abound.


   All hail, "An hundred years ago!"

   And when our lips are dumb,

   Be millions heard rejoicing so,

   An hundred years to come.

   Thy Kingdom come.

   Written in the metre and to suit the tune of the hymn said to have been
   composed and set to music by Luther, and sung by him and his friends,
   as they entered the city of Worms, to appear before the Diet there;
   when, though he had reason to fear treachery and cruelty equal to that
   experienced by his martyred predecessor, John Huss, at the Council of
   Constance, he declared, while his advisers would have dissuaded him
   from going thither, that "if there were as many devils there as there
   were tiles on the houses, he would go and face them."


   Send out Thy light and truth, O God!

   With sound of trumpet from above;

   Break not the nations with Thy rod,

   But draw them as with cords of love;

   Justice and mercy meet;

   The work is well begun,

   Through every clime their feet,

   Who bring glad tidings, run;

   In earth, as heaven, Thy will be done.


   Before Thee every idol fall,

   Rend the false prophet's veil of lies;

   The fulness of the Gentiles call,

   Be Israel saved, let Jacob rise:

   Thy Kingdom come indeed,

   Thy church with union bless,

   All scripture be her creed,

   And every tongue confess

   One Lord,--the Lord our Righteousness.


   Now for the travail of His soul,

   Messiah's peaceful reign advance;

   From sea to sea, from pole to pole,

   He claims His pledged inheritance:

   O Thou most mighty! gird

   Thy sword upon Thy thigh,--

   That two-edged sword,--Thy word,

   By which Thy foes shall die,

   Then be new-born beneath Thine eye.


   So perish all Thine enemies,

   Their enmity alone be slain;

   Them, in the arms of mercy seize,

   Breathe, and their souls shall come again:

   So may Thy friends at length,

   Oft smitten, oft laid low,

   Forth, like the sun in strength,

   Conquering, to conquer go,

   Till to Thy throne all nations flow.

   Farewell to a Missionary.


   Home, kindred, friends, and country, these

   Are things with which we never part;

   From clime to clime, o'er land and seas,

   We bear them with us in our heart:

   And yet 'tis hard to feel resign'd,

   When these, all these, are left behind.


   But when the pilgrim's staff we take,

   And follow Christ from shore to shore,

   Gladly for Him we all forsake,

   Press on, and only look before:

   Though humbled Nature mourns her loss,

   The spirit glories in the Cross.


   It is no sin, like man, to weep,

   Even Jesus wept o'er Lazarus, dead;

   Or yearn for home beyond the deep,

   He had not where to lay His head:

   The patriot's tears will He condemn,

   Who wept o'er lost Jerusalem?


   Take up your cross, and say "Farewell!"

   Go forth without the camp to Him,

   Who left heaven's throne with men to dwell,

   Who died His murderers to redeem:

   Oh! tell His name in every ear;

   Doubt not,--the dead themselves will hear;


   Hear, and come forth to life anew.

   Then, while the Gentile courts they fill,

   Shall not your Saviour's words stand true?

   Home, kindred, friends, and country still,

   In earth's last desert you shall find,

   Yet lose not those you left behind.

   Sow in the morn thy seed,

   At eve hold not thine hand;

   Broad-cast it o'er the land.


   Beside all waters sow,

   The highway furrows stock,

   Drop it where thorns and thistles grow,

   Scatter it on the rock.


   The good, the fruitful ground,

   Expect not here nor there,

   O'er hill and dale, by plots 'tis found;

   Go forth, then, every where,


   Thou know'st not which may thrive

   The late or early sown;

   Grace keeps the precious germs alive,

   When and wherever strown.


   And duly shall appear,

   In verdure, beauty, strength,

   The tender blade, the stalk, the ear,

   And the full corn at length.


   Thou canst not toil in vain;

   Cold, heat, and moist, and dry,

   Shall foster and mature the grain

   For garners in the sky.


   Thence, when the glorious end,

   Till hearts of stone begin to beat.


   Baptize the nations; far and nigh,

      A grain of corn an infant's hand

      Whence twenty stalks may spring, and yield

      Be multiplied to ten times ten,

      Which sown thrice more, would furnish bread

      Wherewith an army might be fed.


   PART II.

      A penny is a little thing

      Which even the poor man's child may fling

      Into the treasury of heaven,

      And make it worth as much as seven.


      As seven! nay, worth its weight in gold,

      And that increased a million fold;

      For lo! a penny tract, if well

      Applied, may save a soul from hell.


      That soul can scarce be saved alone,--

      It must, it will, its bliss make known;

      "Come," it will cry, "and you shall see

      What great things God hath done for me."


      Hundreds that joyful sound may hear

      Hear with the heart as well as ear;

      And these to thousands more proclaim,

      Salvation in the "Only Name."


      That "Only Name," above, below,

      Let Jews, and Turks, and Pagans know;

      Till every tongue and tribe shall call

      On "Jesus Christ" as Lord of all!


   PART III.

      The day of small things God will not

      Despise, the least are unforgot;

      An orphan's offering, widow's mite,

      Are precious in their Maker's sight.


      Children! who now hosannas raise,

      Out of whose mouths He perfects praise,

      Spare from the little you possess,

      What God will own, accept and bless.


      Till through the east, the south, the west,

      Gifts from the north will be so blest,

      That, in the end, earth's countless throngs

      Shall sing with us this song of songs:--


      "Worthy the Lamb for sinners slain,

      Power, riches, honour to obtain,

      Who loved and wash'd us in His blood,

      And made us kings and priests to God."

   Garden thoughts.

   For a Missionary Meeting in a Garden.


   In a garden,--man was placed,

   Meet abode for innocence,

   With his Maker's image graced;

   Sin crept in, and drove him thence,

   Through the world, a wretch undone,

   Seeking rest, and finding none.


   In a garden,--on that night,

   When our Saviour was betray'd,

   With what world-redeeming might,

   In His agony He pray'd!

   Till He drank the vengeance up,

   And with mercy fill'd the cup.


   In a garden,--on the Cross,

   When the spear His heart had riven,

   And for earth's primeval loss,

   Heaven's best ransom had been given;

   Jesus rested from his woes,

   Jesus from the dead arose.


   Here, not Eden's bowers are found,

   Nor forlorn Gethsemane,

   Nor that calm sepulchral ground,

   At the foot of Calvary;

   Yet this scene may well recall

   Sweet remembrances of all.


   Emblem of the Church below!

   Where the Spirit and the Word,

   Fall like dews, like breezes blow,

   And the Lord God's voice is heard,

   Walking in the cool of day,

   While the world is far away.


   Emblem of the Church above!

   Where, as in their native clime,

   'Midst the garden of his love,

   Rescued from the rage of time,

   Saints, as trees of life shall stand,

   Planted by His own right hand.


   Round the fair enclosure here,

   Flames no cherub's threatening sword;

   Ye, who enter, feel no fear:

   Roof'd by heaven, with verdure floor'd,

   Breathing balm from blossoms gay,

   This is Paradise to-day.


   Yet one moment meditate

   On our parents' banishment,

   When from Eden's closing gate,

   Hand in hand, they weeping went,

   Spikenard groves no more to dress,

   But a thorn-set wilderness.


   Then, remember Him who laid

   Uncreated splendour by,

   Lower than the angels made,

   Fallen man to glorify;

   And from death beyond the grave,

   Unto life immortal save.


   Think of Him,--your souls He sought,

   Wandering, never to return;

   Hath He found you?--At the thought,

   Your glad hearts within you burn:

   Then your love, like His, extend;

   Be like Him, the sinner's friend.


   Ye, who smile in rosy youth,

   Glow with manhood, fade through years,

   Send the life, the light, the truth,

   To dead hearts, blind eyes, deaf ears;

   And your very pleasures make

   Charities for Jesus' sake.


   So shall gospel-glory run,

   Round the globe to every clime,

   Brighter than the circling sun;

   Hastening that millennial time,

   When the earth shall be restored,

   As the garden of the Lord.

   The success of the Gospel in our days.


   "Let there be light:" thus spake the Word;

   The Word was God; "and there was light:"

   Still the creative voice is heard;

   A day is born from every night.


   And every night shall turn to day,

   While months, and years, and ages roll;

   But we have seen a brighter ray

   Dawn on the chaos of the soul.


   Nor we alone; its wakening smiles

   Have broke the gloom of pagan sleep;

   The Word hath reach'd the utmost isles,

   God's Spirit moves upon the deep.


   Already from the dust of death,

   Man in his Maker's image stands;

   Once more inhales immortal breath,

   And stretches forth to heaven his hands.


   From day to day, before our eyes,

   Glows and extends the work begun;

   When shall the now creation rise

   On every land beneath the sun?


   When, in the Sabbath of His love,

   Shall God amidst his labours rest;

   And, bending from His throne above,

   Again pronounce His creatures bless'd?

   Arise and shine, your light is come,

   Fair islands of the West!

   Awake and sing, once deaf and dumb,

   Now islands of tne blest.


   Shine, for the glory of the Lord

   Your coral-reefs surrounds:

   Sing, for the trumpet of His word

   O'er all your ocean sounds.


   Poor Africa! through thy waste sands,

   Where Calvary's fountain flows,

   Deserts become Immanuel's lands,

   And blossom like the rose.


   India, beneath the chariot wheels

   Of Juggernaut o'erthrown,

   Thy heart a quickening Spirit feels,

   A pulse beats through the stone.


   China! behold thy quaking wall:

   Foredoom'd by Heaven's decree,

   A hand is writing on it--"Fall!"

   A voice goes forth--"Be free!"


   Ye Pagan tribes! of every race,

   Clime, country, language, hue,

   Believe, obey, be saved by grace,

   The Gospel speaks to you.


   Father of lights! Thy will be done

   Here, as by saints above,

   Give earth's whole empire to Thy Son,

   For He must reign in love:--


   Reign, till beneath His feet, all foes;

   Vanquish'd for ever lie;

   And the last Judgment's sentence close

   The book of prophecy.

   For a Congregation of Negroes.


   Our Master, Jesus, reign'd above,

   The Lord of all was He;

   And yet He chose to set His love,

   O wondrous love! on me.


   Our Master, Jesus,--bless His name!

   I love to hear the sound,--

   When I was lost to seek me came,

   And, O thank God! He found.


   Our Master, Jesus, from His birth

   My sins and sorrows bore;

   And while He lived, like me, on earth,

   A servant's form He wore.


   Our Master, Jesus, went to preach

   The Gospel every where,

   And by His own example teach

   How we the Cross should bear.


   Our Master, Jesus, O how kind

   Was all He did and said!

   He heal'd the sick, the lame, the blind,

   And raised to life the dead,


   Our Master, Jesus, crucified

   By hands of wicked men,

   Pray'd for His murderers;--then He died;

   He died, but rose again.


   Our Master, Jesus, suffer'd this,

   The world from hell to save,

   And bring to heaven's amazing bliss,

   The free man and the slave.


   Our Master, Jesus, takes delight

   In hearts made pure within;

   Though we are black, our souls are white,

   When He forgives our sin.


   Our Master, Jesus, who didst give

   Thyself to die for me,

   Grant the poor negro grace to live,

   And grace to die to Thee.

   The silver trumpets sound,

   Their notes re-echoing far,

   While dawns the day around:

   Joy to the slave; the slave is free;

   It is the year of Jubilee.


   Prisoners of hope, in gloom

   And silence left to die,

   With Christ's unfolding tomb,

   Your portals open fly;

   Rise with your Lord;--He sets you free;

   It is the year of Jubilee.


   Ye, who have sold for naught

   The land your Fathers won,

   Behold, how God hath wrought

   Redemption through His Son;

   Your heritage again is free;

   It is the year of Jubilee.


   Ye, who yourselves have sold

   For debts to Justice due,

   Ransom'd, but not with gold,

   He gave Himself for you!

   The blood of Christ hath made you free:

   It is the year of Jubilee.


   Captives of sin and shame,

   O'er earth and ocean, hear

   On the Decease of an eminent Christian Missionary in the West Indies.


   Oh! "Valiant-for-the-Truth!"

   Hail from Thy battle-field,

   A Christian warrior from thy youth,

   Who never knew to yield;

   The conquering armour here lay down,

   For the white robe, the palm, the crown.


   Where earth and hell combined

   God's Image to defame,

   In darkness hold the immortal mind,

   In chains the mortal frame;

   There didst thou choose thy stormy post,

   Strong in the faith,--thyself a host.


   Not without patient care,

   Sore suffering, day-long toil,

   And many a wrestling night of prayer,

   Didst thou divide the spoil;

   Then ransom'd slaves were made to be

   Free from Man's yoke,--from Satan's free.


   Now rest upon that bed,

   Where once thy Captain lay,

   And sanctified it for the dead

   In Christ, till His great day;

   When they, though worlds around them burn,

   With songs to Zion shall return.


   In that Jerusalem above,

   Where all the saints shall meet;

   Loved with an everlasting love,

   Around their Saviour's feet!

   Oh! there with thine our souls be found

   In life's eternal bundle bound.

   China Evangelized.

   "The Lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle."--Isa. xlii. 4.


   PART I.

      Lift up your heads, ye gates of brass!

      Ye bars of Iron! yield;

      And let the King of Glory pass,--

      The Cross is in the field.


      That banner, brighter than the star,

      That leads the train of night,

      Shines on their march and guides from far

      His servants to the fight.


      A holy war those servants wage;

      --Mysteriously at strife,

      The powers of heaven and hell engage

      For more than death or life.


      Earth's rankest soil they see outspread;

      So throng'd, it seems within,

      One city of the living dead,

      Dead while alive to sin.


      The forms of life are everywhere,

      The spirit nowhere found;

      Like vapours kindling in the air,

      Then sinking in the ground.


      No hope have these above the dust,

      No being but a breath;

      In vanity and lies they trust

      Their very life is death.


   PART II.

      Ye armies of the living God,

      His sacramental host!

      Where hallow'd footstep never trod,

      Take your appointed post.


      Follow the Cross, the ark of peace

      Accompany your path,

      To slaves and rebels bring release

      From bondage and from wrath.


      A barley-cake o'erthrew the camp

      Of Midian, tent by tent,

      Ere morn the trumpet and the lamp

      Through all in triumph went.


      Though China's sons like Midian's fill

      As grasshoppers the vale,

      The sword of God and Gideon still

      To conquer cannot fail.


      As Jericho before the blast

      Of sounding rams' horns fell,

      Sin's strongholds here shall be down cast,

      Down cast these gates of hell.


      Truth error's legions must o'erwhelm

      And China's thickest wall,

      (The wall bf darkness round her realm,)

      At your loud summons fall.


      Though few and small and weak your bands,

      Strong in your Captain's strength,

      Go to the conquest of all lands,

      All must be His at length.


      The closest seal'd between the poles

      Is open'd to your toils;

      Where thrice a hundred million souls

      Are offer'd you for spoils.


      Those spoils, at His victorious feet,

      You shall rejoice to lay,

      And lay yourselves, as trophies meet,

      In His great Judgment-day.


   PART III.

      No carnal weapons those ye bear,

      To lay the aliens low;

      Then strike amain, and do not spare,

      There's life in every blow.


      Life!--more than life on earth can be;

      All in this conflict slain

      Die but to sin,--eternally

      The crown of life to gain.


      O fear not, faint not, halt not now;

      Quit you like men, be strong;

      To Christ shall Buddhu's votaries bow

      And sing with you this song:


      "Uplifted are the gates of brass,

      The bars of iron yield;

      Behold the King of Glory pass;

      The Cross hath won the field."

   Like prostrate seas on every shore,

   That cast their billows at your feet.


   Let hallelujahs to the skies,

   With ocean's everlasting sound,

   (The voice of many waters) rise,

   Day without night, as time goes round.


   Come from the east,--with gifts, ye kings,

   Gold, frankincense, and myrrh;

   Where'er the morning spreads her wings,

   Let man to God his vows prefer.


   Come from the west,--the bond, the free,

   His easy service make your choice;

   Ye isles of the Pacific Sea,

   Like halcyon-nests, in God rejoice.


   Come from the south;--through desert sands,

   A highway for the Lord prepare;

   Let Ethiopia stretch her hands,

   And Libya pour her soul in prayer.


   Come from the north;--let Europe raise

   In all her languages one song;

   Give God the glory, power, and praise,

   That to His holy name belong.


   For He hath bow'd the heavens above,

   And at His feet the mountains flow'd;

   He came;--but not in wrath;--in love,

   To make with men His pure abode.


   With smiles, O earth! thy Maker meet;

   Redemption is in him complete,

   The Gospel now is preach'd to all.

   The Reign of Christ on Earth.--Ps. lxxii.


   Hail to the Lord's Anointed!

   Great David's greater Son;

   Hail in the time appointed,

   His reign on earth begun!

   He comes to break oppression,

   To set the captive free;

   To take away transgression,

   And rule in equity.


   He comes with succour speedy,

   To those who suffer wrong;

   To help the poor and needy,

   And bid the weak be strong;

   To give them songs for sighing,

   Their darkness turn to light;

   Whose souls, condemn'd and dying,

   Were precious in His sight.


   By such shall He be feared,

   While sun and moon endure,

   Beloved, obey'd, revered;

   For He shall judge the poor,

   Through changing generations,

   With justice, mercy, truth,

   While stars maintain their stations

   Or moons renew their youth.


   He shall come down like showers,

   Upon the fruitful earth,

   And love, joy, hope, like flowers,

   Spring in His path to birth:

   Before Him, on the mountains,

   Shall Peace, the herald, go;

   And Righteousness, in fountains,

   From hill to valley flow.


   Arabia's desert-ranger

   To Him shall bow the knee,

   The Ethiopian stranger

   His glory come to see:

   With offerings of devotion,

   Ships from the Isles shall meet,

   To pour the wealth of ocean

   In tribute at His feet.


   Kings shall fall down before Him,

   And gold and incense bring,

   All nations shall adore Him,

   His praise all people sing:

   For He shall have dominion

   O'er river, sea, and shore,

   Far as the eagle's pinion

   Or dove's light wing can soar.


   For Him shall prayer unceasing,

   And daily vows ascend;

   His kingdom still increasing,

   A kingdom without end:

   The mountain-dews shall nourish

   A seed in weakness sown,

   Whose fruit shall spread and flourish,

   And shake like Lebanon.


   O'er every foe victorious,

   He on His throne shall rest,

   From age to age more glorious,

   All-blessing and all-blest;

   The tide of time shall never

   His covenant remove;

   His Name shall stand for ever,

   That Name to us is--Love.

      His healing beams to hail and bless:--


      When God's own day of rest shall be

      Hallow'd, by all that live and move

      On peopled land, or desert sea,

      While all its hallowing influence prove:--


      When men of every hue and speech

      Shall hasten to the House of Prayer,

      And Christ's disciples go and teach

      The Gospel to all nations there:--


      When meekly every heart receives

      The engrafted word, whose vigorous shoots

      Yield in their season tender leaves,

      Expanding flowers, and ripen'd fruits:--


      Leaves of profession ever green,

      And flowers of promise never sere,

      Till fruits of holiness are seen,

      In rich succession round the year.


   PART II.

      As in Jerusalem above,

      Life's trees, the plants of God's right hand,

      Along the river of His love,

      To nourish saints and angels, stand:--


      So earth, that garden of the Lord,

      Though long laid waste for man's offence,

      May yet see Paradise restored,

      And a now age of innocence.


      When Adam's offspring, born to death,

      From sun to sun, from pole to pole,

      Shall feel again the Almighty's breath,

      And man become a living soul:--


      A soul new-born, beyond the range

      Of time, temptation, death, or sin,

      God's image, stampt on it, to change,

      Nor quench the life of God within.


      Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard,

      Nor heart of man conceived the grace,

      Which God, in His eternal word,

      Hath surely promised, shall take place.


      O Sun of Righteousness! unveil

      Thy heaven of uncreated rays,

      Till all that breathe shall bless and hail

      The glory of the latter days.


      Meanwhile, rejoicing on their beds,

      Whatever morning meets their eye,

      May saints, from slumber lift their heads,

      To greet the day-spring from on high.

   Hail the day with sacred mirth,

   When the trumpet of salvation

   Sounds the jubilee of earth,

   And creation

   Travails with the world's new birth.


   Then the north, in darkness shrouded,

   Jacob's rising star shall bless;

   And the eastern morn, unclouded,

   Bring the sun of righteousness,

   Cheering, healing,

   Sin-sick souls in heart's distress.


   Then her swarthy sons and daughters,

   Afric to the Cross shall bring;

   And the angel of the waters

   Hear His coral islands sing,

   "Hallelujah!"

   Till the whole Pacific ring.


   O thou everlasting Father,

   Give the kingdoms to Thy Son;

   He hath died that He might gather

   All God's children into one;

   For the travail

   Of His soul, let this be done!


   Yea, it must be:--Thou hast spoken,

   And Thy covenant shall last;

   Though the arch of heaven were broken,

   And the earth's foundations cast

   Down the abysses;

   Yet Thy word, O God! stands fast.


   On Thy holy hill of Zion,

   Hast Thou not ordained His seat?

   Now, as Judah's conquering lion,

   Lay all foes beneath His feet,

   Till His armies

   In eternal triumph meet.


   We have join'd their marching legions,

   Where our fathers fought, we fight;

   Slavery's cane-lands, Brama's regions,

   Are exulting at the sight;

   Freedom, freedom,

   Comes with Gospel-life and light.


   All the languages of Babel,

   Weapons for the warfare yield;

   And with these we well are able,

   By Thy Spirit's might, to wield

   In the battle,

   Truth's safe guard, and Faith's strong shield.


   Thus, through fifty years victorious,

   Thou hast led our brethren on;

   Arm them now for deeds more glorious,

   Till the latest field is won:

   And all people

   Bow the knee, and kiss the Son.

   Heralds through every clime we send,

   Here, for the travail of His soul,

   He claims the promised heritage,

   The Father's gift--from pole to pole--

   Earth's utmost bound, to time's last age.


   Him shall all tongues confess, all knees

   Shall bow before that mercy-seat,

   Love reconcile all enemies,

   Or wrath subdue beneath His feet.


   A year of Jubilee we hail!

   Since we in faith this work began

   It must go on: it cannot fail

   While we are true to God and man.

   For the Centenary Jubilee of the Moravian, or United Brethren's Church,
   June 17, 1822.


   Thine arm, O Lord, of old

   In lands of desolation,

   Enclosed an humble fold,

   Redeem'd a congregation:

   Our fathers, like a flock,

   The great, good Shepherd led,

   Gave water from the rock,

   With heavenly manna fed.


   A poor, afflicted race,

   But in Thy name confiding,

   They walk'd before Thy face,

   Thou in their midst abiding;

   While Satan's fellest rage

   With patient faith they bore;

   Consumed from age to age,

   Till known on earth no more.


   Yet was a remnant saved;

   Still wrestling with affliction,

   Their foes they singly braved,

   Beneath Thy benediction:

   Again went forth the word,

   Abroad the Spirit flew;

   The voice of God was heard,

   Creating all things new.


   An hundred years are past,

   Since that revival glorious;

   And still Thy Church stands fast,

   O'er earth and hell victorious;

   The path our fathers trod,

   Lay through Gethsemane,

   Thither, O Lamb of God,

   This day we follow Thee.


   Thence borne to Calvary's brow,

   Thy griefs and sorrows viewing,

   With heart, soul, spirit, now

   Our covenant renewing:

   Thy love we here record,

   Our sins with tears bewail;

   Thy blood pleads for us, Lord;

   O let that plea prevail.


   Through suffering, shame, and loss,

   Through honour, wealth, and pleasure,

   To glory in Thy Cross,

   As our eternal treasure;

   That Cross with joy to bear

   Through realms that know Thee not;

   And thus Thy way prepare,

   Still be Thy Brethren's lot.

HYMN CCLXXII.

   8.7.8.7.8.8.7

   James Montgomery

   For the Centenary Celebration, August 13, 1827, of the memorable day of
   the union of all hearts and minds in the congregation of the United
   Brethren at Hernhut, amongst whom, since their revival, five years
   previously, considerable differences had prevailed on minor points,
   which were all blessedly reconciled at the Holy Sacrament in the parish
   church of Bethelsdorf, in 1727.


   The God of your forefathers praise,

   Thou, Brethren's Congregation!

   Whose mighty arm, by wondrous ways,

   Accomplished their salvation:

   He heard their groans, came down and broke

   The bigot's chain, the tyrant's yoke,

   And led them forth to freedom.


   He brought them to his chosen place,

   Among the woods and mountains;

   The desert fled before their face.

   Gardens, and fields, and fountains,

   Round their new homes and temple sprang,

   While day and night hosannas rang

   Through all their little Zion.


   They walked with God in peace and love,

   But failed with one another;

   While sternly for the faith they strove,

   Brother fell out with brother:

   But He, in whom they put their trust,

   Who knew their frames, that they were dust,

   Pitied and healed their weakness.


   He found them in His house of prayer,

   With one accord assembled,

   And so reveal'd His presence there,

   They wept for joy, and trembled;

   One cup they drank, one bread they brake,

   One baptism shared, one language spake,

   Forgiving and forgiven.


   Then forth they went with tongues of flame,

   In one blest theme delighting,

   The love of Jesus, and His Name

   God's children all uniting!

   That love, our theme and watchword still;

   That law of love may we fulfil,

   And love as we have loved.


   Jesus, Thy little flock behold,

   Here met in sweet communion,

   Confirm, as in the years of old,

   Our sacramental union;

   Renew that day of Pentecost,

   Send down on us the Holy Ghost,

   The promise of the Father.


   Now blow the trump of Jubilee,

   And while the Church rejoices,

   As in one faith, hope, charity,

   Join songs, and hearts, and voices,

   To Father, Son, and Spirit raise,

   On earth, the song of heavenly praise,

   Sing, "Holy, Holy, Holy."

   8.6.8.6.8.8.8.6

   James Montgomery

   For the Centenary Anniversaries of the Brethren's Eldership, and the
   beginning of the Society for the furtherance of the Gospel in the
   Moravian Church, November 13 and 19, 1841.


   PART I.

      All hail! our Church's Elder dear,

      Jesus, her glorious head!

      To Thy disciples now appear,

      As risen from the dead;

      Let our rejoicing souls in Thee,

      The tokens of Thy Passion see,

      And hear Thy gentle voice anew,

      Say "Peace be unto you."


      Remembering what our fathers told,

      Thou didst in their young day,

      This solemn Jubilee we hold,

      That we, as then did they,

      Ourselves in covenant may bind,

      With soul and strength, and heart and mind,

      Through life and death, on land, o'er sea,

      Meekly to follow Thee.


      Revive Thy work amidst the years,

      Our brethren still employ,

      O'er heathen soils to sow in tears,

      With hope to reap in joy:

      Though wide the fields, the labourers few,

      If Thou our failing faith renew,

      The weakest of Thy servants, we

      Can all things do through Thee.


      Through Thee, from Greenland's sterile rocks,

      Rich harvests have been led;

      In Indian forests wandering flocks,

      With heavenly knowledge fed;

      In island-prisons o'er the sea,

      Bond-slaves have been made gospel-free;

      Midst lion-haunts, on Afric sands,

      Strange tribes lift holy hands.


   PART II.

      To-day, one world-neglected race,

      We fervently commend

      To Thee, and to Thy Word of grace;

      Lord, visit and befriend

      People scatter'd, peel'd, and rude,

      By land and ocean-solitude,

      Cut off from ev'ry social shore,

      In dreary Labrador.


      Thither, while to and fro she steers,

      Still guide our annual bark [13] ,

      By night and day, through hopes and fears,

      While, lonely as the ark,

      Along her single track she braves,

      Gulphs, whirlpools, ice-fields, winds, and waves,

      To waft glad tidings to the shore

      Of longing Labrador.


      How welcome to the watching eye,

      From morn till evening fix'd,

      The first faint speck that shews her nigh,

      Where surge and sky are miss'd;

      Till looming large, and larger yet,

      With bounding prow, and sails full set,

      She speeds to anchor on the shore

      Of joyful Labrador.


      Then hearts with hearts, and souls with souls,

      In thrilling transport meet,

      Though dark and broad the Atlantic rolls,

      Between their parted feet:

      For written words, with boundless range,

      Thoughts, feelings, prayers, can interchange,

      And once a year join Britain's shore

      To kindred Labrador.


      Then at the vessel's glad return,

      The absent meet again;

      At home our hearts within us burn,

      To trace the cunning pen,

      Whose strokes, like rays from star to star,

      Bring happy messages from far,

      And once a year to Britain's shore

      Join Christian Labrador.


   PART III.

      O Thou, in whom we all are one,

      If faithful found and true,

      Thy will on earth by each be done,

      As each in heaven would do:

      To Thee ourselves we first would give,

      Live to Thy glory while we live;

      From step to step on Thee rely,

      Then in Thy service die.

HYMN CCLXXIV.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   For the Jubilee Celebration of the Religious Tract Society, 1848.


   PART I.

      The sunbeams, infinitely small,

      In numbers numberless,

      Reveal, pervade, illumine all

      Nature's void wilderness.


      But, meeting worlds upon their way,

      Wrapt in primeval night,

      In language without sound, they say

      To each--"God sends you light."


      Anon, with beauty, life and love,

      Those wandering planets glow,

      And shine themselves, as stars above,

      On gazers from below.


      Oh! could the first Archangel's eye,

      In everlasting space,

      Through all the mazes of the sky,

      A single sunbeam trace!


      He might behold the lonely one

      Its destiny fulfil,

      As punctual as the parent-sun

      Performs its Maker's will.


   PART II.

      The Sun of Righteousness, with rays

      Of uncreated light,

      His power and glory thus displays

      Through Nature's darkest night.


      The night of guilt, remorse, despair,

      In which transgressors roam,

      Yet, self-bewilder'd everywhere,

      Never draw nearer home.


      On such, with healing in His wings,

      Along their downward path,

      Guidance and help His rising brings

      And warns to flee from wrath.


      Rays from that Sun of Righteousness,

      Our humble missiles dart;

      Mighty at once to wound and bless,

      To break and bind the heart.


      Tracts, those swift messengers of peace

      For men, with God at strife,

      To Satan's slaves proclaim release,

      To Death's condemn'd-ones, life.


      Not with the excellence of speech,

      But by the Spirit of Truth,

      The doctrines of the Cross they preach

      To manhood, age, and youth.


      They flash the terrors of the Lord,

      To make the scorner fear,

      But speak the Gospel's sweetest word

      In the poor sinner's ear.


      Oh! could the first Archangel's sight

      The least of these pursue,

      He might record,--in its brief flight,

      Each had a work to do.


      A work of grace, a work of power,

      But, what that was below,

      Time's last, Eternity's first hour

      To heaven and earth will show.


      O Ye! who send these heralds forth--

      By millions bid them fly,--

      From east to west, from south to north,

      As sunbeams fill the sky.

HYMN CCLXXV.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   For the Jubilee of the Religious Tract Society, 1848.


   Proclaim the year of Jubilee;

   New songs of glory sing;

   From shore to shore, from sea to sea,

   Your gratulations bring.


   Through fifty years the constant sun,

   On his untiring race,

   Round the blue firmament hath run,

   Since that first day of grace:--


   When tracts, on embassies of love,

   By our forefathers sent,

   Charged with glad tidings from above,

   Into all nations went.


   Now, by the Spirit of the Lord,

   With bounty unconfined,

   The eternal riches of His Word

   Are dealt to all mankind.


   Tracts have the gift of tongues; they preach

   Through every peopled land,

   In all the forms of human speech,

   What all may understand:--


   Salvation in that Holy Name,

   Which heaven and earth adore,

   Christ Jesus, yesterday the same,

   To-day, and evermore.


   Tracts have the wings of angels, spread

   To waft the joyful sound

   Of resurrection ftoni the dead,

   Where'er the curse is found:--


   The primal curse from Adam's fall,

   Sin's wages, and sin's doom,

   The bitterness of life, and all

   The terrors of the tomb,


   What scale of numbers, grasp of thought,

   What power of words could speak

   The miracles of mercy wrought

   By instruments so weak?


   Weak, but almighty at His will,

   Who speaks, and it is done;

   With whom, to purpose and fulfil,

   The Will and power are one.


   In the Lamb's Book of Life, alone

   Those annals lie, in sight

   Of Him who sits upon the throne,

   --Whose deeds can bear that light?


   Can ours, who, where our fathers trod,

   Along this narrow way,

   Would work like them, the works of God,

   Like them, would watch and pray?


   Bound in the same sure covenant,

   Let us, their children, be;

   And, Lord, that we may keep it, grant

   The mind which was in Thee.

   James Montgomery

   The Poor praying for Bread in Time of Scarcity.


   To God most awful and most high,

   Who form'd the earth, the sea, the sky;

   To Him on whom all worlds depend,

   Our humbled hearts in sighs we send.


   Will He who hears the ravens cry,

   Reject our prayers, and bid us die?

   Will He refuse His keep to yield,

   Who clothes the lilies of the field?


   Pale famine lifts at His command,

   Her withering arm, and blasts the land;

   The harvests perish at her breath,

   Her train are want, disease, and death.


   But when He smiles the desert blooms,

   New life is born among the tombs;

   O'er the glad plains abundance teems,

   And plenty rolls in bounteous streams.


   Father of grace whom we adore,

   Bless Thy large family--the poor;

   The poor on Thee alone depend,

   Continue Thou the poor man's friend.


   Content to live by toil and pain,

   May we eternal riches gain;

   Meanwhile, by Thy free goodness fed,

   Give us this day our daily bread.

   God cares for Birds and Flowers.--Luke, xii. 24-27.


   Flowers grow in sweet societies,

   O'er meadow, hill, and dale;

   Mingle their colours to our eyes,

   Their perfumes in the gale.


   Sprung from the dust, they rise above

   The meanness of their birth;

   They look to heaven, and yet they love

   To beautify the earth.


   Not birds more duly build and sing,

   Nor stars in turn appear,

   Than these their splendid legions bring,

   To crown and close the year.


   They toil not, neither do they spin,

   And yet their Maker's will,

   Exempt from sorrow, as from sin,

   They live but to fulfil.


   Ah! thus might He that made us see

   Our Sabbath Schools increase;

   And while we dwell in unity,

   In Him may we have peace;--


   Like flowers from Him receive, dispense

   The fragrance of His grace;

   And when, like flowers, transplanted hence,

   May fairer fill our place.

   James Montgomery

   For a wet Harvest Season.


   We lift our eyes, our hands, to Thee,

   Our knees, our souls, to Thee we bend;

   Father of all earth's family,

   The appointed weeks of harvest send.


   The ground, Thy table, is full-spread

   With food to nourish man and beast,

   Hast Thou prepared the children's bread,

   And wilt Thou now forbid the feast?


   Summer and winter, day and night,

   Seed-time and harvest Thou hast will'd;

   And dew and rain, and warmth and light,

   Have each their gracious work fulfill'd.


   Shall whelming floods the hopes destroy

   Of those who in Thy promise trust?

   Shall storms prevent the reaper's joy,

   And lay his confidence in dust?


   O bid the winds and waters cease,

   The lowering firmament unshroud;

   Think on Thy covenant of peace,

   Look on Thy bow,--'tis in the cloud!


   We fall adoring at Thy feet,

   Our prayer is heard, the veil is riven;

   With pure beart-offerings let us eat

   The bread that cometh down from heaven.

   Thanksgiving for Harvest.


   The God of harvest praise,

   In loud thanksgivings, raise

   Hand, heart, and voice;

   The valleys laugh and sing,

   Forests and mountains ring,

   The plains their tribute bring,

   The streams rejoice.


   Of food for man and beast,

   Jehovah spreads a feast,

   Above, beneath:

   Ye herds and flocks, draw near,

   Fowls, ye are welcome here;

   His goodness crowns the year

   For all that breathe.


   Garden and orchard ground,

   Autumnal fruits have crown'd,

   The vintage glows:

   Here plenty pours her horn;

   There the full tide of corn,

   Sway'd by the breath of morn,

   The land o'erflows.


   The wind, the rain, the sun,

   Their genial work have done;

   Wouldst thou be fed?

   Man, to thy labour bow,

   Thrust in the sickle now,

   Reap where thou once didst plough,

   God sends thee bread.


   Thy few seeds scatter'd wide,

   His hand hath multiplied;

   Here thou may'st find

   Christ's miracle renew'd;

   With self-producing food,

   He feeds a multitude,--

   He feeds mankind.


   The God of harvest praise;

   Hands, hearts, and voices raise

   With one accord;

   From field to garner throng,

   Bearing your sheaves along;

   And in your harvest song,

   Bless ye the Lord.


   Yea, bless His Holy Name,

   And your souls' thanks proclaim

   Through all the earth:

   To glory in your lot

   Is comely;--but be not

   His benefits forgot

   Amidst your mirth.

   Heart-Searching.--Jeremiah, viii. 20.


   Is summer ended,--harvest past,

   And I not sav'd?--God of grace,

   Thy covenant yet standeth fast,

   Still Thy command is--"Seek my face."


   Ah! now or never may I call

   On Thy great Name, through Christ, Thy Son;

   This hour, this moment, I might fall,--

   Fall, and for ever be undone.


   Save, Lord, I perish!--hear my cry;

   I walk in darkness,--Thou art light;

   Shine forth upon my spirit's eye,

   Faith, that outsees the eye of sight.


   Faint, yet pursuing, I lay hold

   On Thy sure Word, which cannot fail;

   Through weakness strong, by fear made bold,

   I plead that Word, and must prevail.


   Thine own Almightiness is mine,

   When wrestling thus in prayer with Thee;

   Through Christ's atonement, I am Thine;

   Now let me Thy salvation see,

   So prone, so eager to depart

   From Thee, the living God and true.


   O crucify this carnal mind,

   'Tis enmity, my God, to Thee;

   I cannot love Thee, till I find

   The mind that was in Christ in me.


   O sanctify this sinful soul;

   Health to the dying leper give;

   Thou, if Thou wilt, canst make me whole;

   Speak but the word, and I shall live.


   O disenthrall this captive will,

   (Free only when Thou mak'st it free,)

   That I may glory to fulfil

   Thy perfect law of liberty.


   Then, though through life, a worm of earth,

   In death returning to the clod,

   I shall become, by second birth,

   An heir of heaven, a child of God.

   The Harvest of two Worlds.--John, iv. 33.


   Lift up your eyes, look round;

   The fields to harvest white,

   Are bow'd, and shaking to the ground;

   Where soon must perish quite,

   The sower's seed, the tiller's toil,

   The husbandman's abortive trust,

   Whose crops ungather'd load the soil,

   Down trodden to the dust:

   For wide the fields are spread, and far,

   And few, and weak, the labourers are.


   Lord of the Harvest! now,

   Send faithful labourers forth,

   To wield the sickle, guide the plough,

   Where east, west, south, and north,

   Far as the fields of life are spread,

   The scythe of Time, at Death's stern doom,

   Is reaping harvests for the dead,

   To crowd the garner-tomb:

   Lord! Lord! a precious remnant save

   From death--from death beyond the grave.

   The Effect of God's Blessings.


   As from the winter sky,

   When keen the tempests blow,

   O'er fields that waste and barren lie,

   Descends the softening snow;


   Not with ice-binding cold

   To chill the stubborn soil,

   But crumble and prepare the mould

   To meet the plougher's toil.


   Then dew, rain, thunder-showers

   With milk and honey feed

   The infant family of flowers,

   And nurse the sower's seed.


   Till autumn-sunshine bland,

   The grateful ground receives,

   And harvest-moonlight, o'er the land,

   Brings home the reaper's sheaves:--


   Thus, in the reign of grace,

   Come gospel-blessings down,

   And where they fall or shine, the place

   With love, joy, peace, they crown.


   God's word, His will performs,

   And in this world, destroy'd

   By sin and death, through calms or storms,

   Returns not to Him void.


   May our great union-field,

   Where precious seed is sown,

   Harvests of souls in season yield

   To gather round His throne.

   A Bygone Year.

   "For who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto Me? saith the
   Lord."--Jer. xxx. 21.


   A year, another year is fled;

   Its issues who can tell?

   Millions of voices of the dead

   Reply from heaven or hell.


   All these were living at the birth

   Of the departed year;

   They all have vanish'd from the earth,

   We fill their places here.


   Though to the eye, the ear, the mind

   Of man their speech is seal'd,

   The eternal meaning each may find,

   In two plain words reveal'd.


   Lost spirits, from the dark abyss,

   Cry mournfully "Beware!"

   Spirits in glory, and in bliss,

   Sing joyfully "Prepare!"


   Thus timely warned, and moved with fear,

   Of wrath, let us beware;

   For life or death, in this new year,

   For earth and heaven prepare.


   Who then of those with us, this day

   In childhood, youth, or age,

   "To love the Lord our God" can say

   "We all our hearts engage."

   Our soul shall magnify the Lord,

   Since He regards our low estate,

   And hears His handmaids when they pray,

   We humbly plead at Mercy's gate,

   Where none are ever turn'd away.


   The poor are His peculiar care,

   To them His promises are sure;

   His gifts the poor in spirit share:

   O may we always thus be poor!


   God of our hope, to Thee we bow,

   Thou art our refuge in distress;

   The Husband of the widow, Thou,

   The Father of the fatherless.


   May we the law of love fulfil,

   To bear each other's burdens here;

   Suffer, and do Thy righteous will,

   And walk in all Thy faith and fear.


   Didst Thou not give Thy Son to die,

   For our transgressions, in our stead?

   And can Thy goodness aught deny

   To those for whom Thy Son hath bled?


   Then may our union, here begun,

   Endure for ever, firm and free;

   At Thy right-hand may we be one,

   One with each other, and with Thee.

   James Montgomery

   Hymn for the Opening of the Sheffield General Infirmary, October, 1797.


   When, like a stranger on our sphere,

   The lowly Jesus sojourn'd here,

   Where'er He went Affliction fled,

   And Sickness rear'd her drooping head.


   The eye That roll'd in irksome night

   Beheld His face, for He was light;

   The opening ear, the loosen'd tongue,

   His precepts heard, His praises sung.


   Demoniac Madness, dark and wild,

   With melancholy transport smiled;

   The storm of horror ceased to roll,

   And reason lighten'd through his soul.


   His touch the outcast leper heal'd,

   His lips the sinner's pardon seal'd;

   The palsied frame, the crippled limb,

   Felt Virtue going forth from Him.


   Behold Him in the wilderness,

   He lifts His hand the bread to bless;

   And while the fainting multitude

   Look'd up to Him, gave all their food.


   In Him with man's infirmity,

   The fulness of the Godhead see,

   Warm tears o'er Lazarus He shed,

   Then spake the word that raised the dead.


   Through paths of loving-kindness brought,

   May all our work in Him be wrought;

   In His great Name, let us dispense

   The crumbs of our benevolence.


   Hark! the sweet voice of pity calls

   Misfortune to these hallow'd walls;

   The breaking heart, and burthen'd breast,

   And helpless Poverty distrest.


   Here the whole family of woe

   Shall friends, and home, and comfort know;

   The blasted form and shipwreck'd mind,

   Shall here a tranquil haven find.


   And Thou, dread Power! whose sovereign breath,

   Is health or sickness, life or death,

   Send Thine abundant blessing down,

   And with success our labours crown.

   Who walk by faith, and not by sight,

   They feel Thee nigh indeed.


   Light in Thy light the blind may see,

   No more by sin estranged;

   Light in the Lord, so let us be,

   Into Thine image changed.


   Since Thou Thyself dost still display

   Unto the pure in heart;

   O make us, children of the day,

   To know Thee as Thou art.


   For Thou art light, and life, and love;

   And Thy redeem'd below

   May see Thee, as Thy saints above,

   And know Thee as they know

   For a Sermon before a Society for the Recovery of Persons apparently
   Drowned.


   When Israel, press'd by Pharaoh, stood,

   Affrighted, on the Red Sea shore,

   At Thy rebuke, O Lord, the flood

   Retired,--the ransom'd tribes pass'd o'er.


   When Jonah was cast out to die,

   And all Thy storms went o'er his head,

   Thou, from the depths didst hear his cry,

   And raise him thence as from the dead.


   When Peter, walking on the wave,

   Felt his faith fail, his footsteps sink,

   Thy blessed Son was there to save,

   And snatch'd him from destruction's brink.


   Within Thy courts, great God, behold

   A little grateful band appear;

   O'er these the whelming waters roll'd,

   but help was nigh, and they are here.


   Here, in Thy courts, their vows to pay,

   And praise Thee with their living breath;

   Where had their spirits been this day,

   Hadst Thou not rescued them from death?


   Redeem'd from the devouring tomb,

   Restored to life, and joy, and bliss;

   O save them from a deeper gloom,

   And to a happier world than this.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   For a Day of Humiliation during the Prevalence of the Cholera.


   Let the land mourn through all its coasts,

   The king lay by his state;

   Princes and rulers, at their posts,

   Awhile sit desolate.


   Let priests and people, high and low,

   Rich, poor, and great, and small,

   Invoke, in fellowship of woe,

   The Maker of them all.


   For God hath summon'd from his place

   Death, in a direr form,

   To waken, warn, and scourge our race,

   Than earthquake, fire, or storm.


   Let Churches weep within their pale,

   And families apart;

   Let each in secresy bewail

   The plague of his own heart.


   So, while the land bemoans its sin,

   The pestilence may cease,

   And mercy, tempering wrath, bring in

   Not health alone, but peace:--


   The peace of God, which passeth thought,

   Keep every heart and mind,

   Till all, by this affliction taught,

   Be to His will resign'd.

   During the Cholera.--Confession and Supplication.


   It is the Lord!--Behold His hand

   Outstretch'd with an afflictive rod;

   And hark! a voice goes through the land,

   "Be still, and know that I am God."


   Shall we, like guilty Adam, hide

   In darkest shades our darker fears?

   For who His coming may abide?

   Or who shall stand when He appears?


   No,--let us throng around His seat;

   No,--let us meet Him face to face,

   Prostrate our spirits at his feet,

   Confess our sins, and sue for grace.


   Who knows but God will hear our cries,

   Turn swift destruction from our path,

   Restrain His judgments, or chastise

   In tender mercy, not in wrath?


   He will, He will, for Jesus pleads;

   Let heaven and earth His love record;

   For us, for us, He intercedes;

   Our help is nigh:--it is the Lord!


   Into His hands then let us fall,

   Come health or sickness, life or death;

   Whether He send us balm for gall,

   Or immortality for breath.

   Thanksgiving for Deliverance from the Cholera.


   Walking on the wingëd wind,

   Fear before Him, Death behind;

   When the Lord came down in wrath,

   Clouds and darkness girt His path.


   Thence abroad His arrows flew,

   Thick and fast they smote and slew;

   We in dust and ashes lay,

   None could help,--but all could pray.


   Fervent prayer had power with God,

   Caught the lightnings on its rod,

   Faith and hope, amidst our bands,

   Holding up its weary hands.


   Prayer prevail'd amidst despair,

   God delights to honour prayer;

   Judgment laid its terrors by,

   Mercy beam'd o'er earth and sky.


   Now be sorrow turned to song,

   Let the bruised reed grow strong,

   Smoking flax break forth and blaze,

   Prayer transform itself to praise.


   Let the living now record

   All the goodness of the Lord;

   Him let the redeem'd adore,

   Go in peace, and sin no more.

   Thanksgiving for the Removal of the Cholera from Sheffield, 1832.


   Sing Hallelujah; sing

   Glory to God alone!

   Bring your oblations, bring

   Thank-offerings to the throne;

   Take words of joy, of comfort take,

   Awake to love, to life awake.


   The Lord put forth His hand,

   He touch'd us and we died;

   Vengeance went through the land,

   But mercy walk'd beside;

   He heard our prayers; He saw our tears,

   And stay'd the plague, and quell'd our fears.


   What shall we give to Thee?

   O Thou, whose purer eyes

   Behold iniquity

   In man's best sacrifice?

   Ourselves we give, but rest our claim

   On Christ, and know none other Name.


   For Jesus' sake forgive

   Thy people, Lord, and spare,

   To Him and Thee to live,

   For Thine and His we are;

   Thy quickening Spirit gave us breath,

   Thy Son, by death, has conquer'd death.

   Thy power upholds what Thou hast made;

   Thy praise, Lord God, by all be sung.


   Though small amidst the glorious space,

   Where suns and stars Thy might proclaim,

   To Thee we consecrate this place,

   Here we record Thy Holy Name.


   A temple built with hands, to Thee

   For children's children here shall rise;

   O may their ceaseless worship be,

   Pure offerings, free-will sacrifice.


   Now to the prayer of faith attend,

   Thou God who answerest by fire;

   Maker and Builder Thou, of all

   Around us and above,

   On Thine Almighty Name we call

   To crown our work of love.


   If, moved by Thee, in dust we lay

   A true foundation here,

   Though heaven and earth must pass away,

   Thy counsel shall appear.


   An earthly temple to Thy praise,

   Our labouring hands would pile;

   Do Thou a spiritual temple raise,

   Within its walls, the while.


   Of living stones that temple frame,

   Founded on Christ alone,

   Inscribed with His exalted name,

   By all men read and known.


   From thence, as time and tide roll by,

   May ransom'd souls ascend,

   Safe in their Father's home on high,

   Eternity to spend.

   Not in Jerusalem alone,

   God hears and answers prayer,

   Nor on Samaria's mountain known,

   Dispenses blessings there.


   True worshippers may now draw nigh,

   Sinners may seek His face,

   Assured to meet His ear and eye,

   All times, in every place.


   Hence in the secrecy of thought

   Our silent souls may pray,

   Or round the household altar brought

   Begin and close the day.


   Yet, meet it is, and right, and good,

   Where He records His Name,

   To mingle with the multitude,

   And His high praise proclaim.


   There, while the Lord their God they bless,

   And He shines forth on them,

   His Church appears in holiness,

   Their new Jerusalem.


   Then let us consecrate to Him,

   These walls with love and fear,

   God dwelt between the cherubim,

   May God in Christ dwell here.

   A sure and tried foundation stone,

   Lord God, in Zion Thou hast laid;

   Grounded and fix'd on Christ alone,

   Thy Church shall flourish undismay'd.


   In vain the gates of hell assail,

   Impregnable is her defence;

   The rock of ages cannot fail,

   Nor winds, nor floods, remove her thence.


   We build an earthly temple here;

   Behold the work with favouring eye,

   And when our hands the top-stone rear,

   "Grace, grace unto it," be the cry.


   Then, by the Spirit of Thy might,

   Come with the Gospel's joyful sound,

   And here reveal'd in Thine own light,

   Be Thou by all who seek Thee found.


   Lord! we have loved Thy dwelling-place,

   Thy Mercy-seat with men below,

   Here then, to all who seek Thy face,

   From age to age Thy goodness show.

   For the Opening of a Place of Worship.


   Not here, as to the prophet's eye,

   The Lord upon His throne appears;

   Nor seraphim responsive cry,

   "Holy! thrice holy!" in our ears.


   Yet God is present in this place,

   Veil'd in serener majesty,

   So full of glory, truth, and grace,

   That faith alone such light can see.


   Nor, as He in the temple taught,

   Is Christ beneath this roof reveal'd,

   When blind, and deaf, and dumb, were brought,

   Lepers and lame,--and all were heal'd.


   Yet here, when two or three shall meet,

   Or thronging multitudes are found,

   All may sit down at Jesus' feet,

   And hear and know the joyful sound.


   Send forth the seraphim, O Lord!

   To touch Thy servants' lips with fire;

   Saviour! give them Thy faithful word;

   God, Holy Ghost! their hearts inspire.

   Father of glory, God of grace!

   An house of prayer to Thee we build;

   Oft may the consecrated place,

   Be with Thy grace and glory fill'd.


   Lord of the living and the dead,

   When here the dead and living meet,

   The fullness of Thy blessing shed,

   On all who seek Thy mercy-seat.


   While those who sleep in Jesus, rest

   In kindred dust and ashes near,

   This thought--their souls in heaven are blest!

   The hearts of mourning friends shall cheer.


   They lived by faith, in hope they died,

   The Cross behind their Saviour bore,

   And in His footsteps trod, to guide

   Their followers where He trod before.


   We live,--Oh! let the living praise

   The goodness that prolongs our breath;

   We die,--die daily; all our days

   Be preparation-days for death.


   Come, then, that end of mortal strife,

   We on Christ's faithful word rely,--

   "The Resurrection and the Life!"

   Who trust in Him shall never die.

   Behold yon bright array,

   Before the sapphire throne;

   There, young nor old, nor rich nor poor,

   There, bond nor free, are known.


   At once they strike their lyres,

   At once break off,--and all,

   With trembling joy, and silent love,

   In adoration fall.


   Whate'er their lot below,

   As fellow-heirs of bliss,

   In heaven their services are one:

   Let earth be heaven in this.


   As brethren, thus may we

   Worship with one accord;

   In stillness wait, in prayer bow down,

   Stand up, and bless the Lord.


   As pilgrims on their way,

   Thousands these courts shall fill,

   And travel on from strength to strength,

   Abreast to Zion's hill.


   May all those pilgrims meet,

   When faith is changed to sight

   Where the Lord God Himself shall be

   The temple and the light:--


   Where on the sea of glass,

   The ransom'd nations sing,

   And to the Lamb that once was slain

   Eternal glory bring.

   When angels hail'd Messiah's birth.


   From Eden to the King of kings,

   In sinless man's primeval days,

   The voices of all living things,

   All nature's sounds, were notes of praise.


   When Adam by transgression fell,

   Concord to dissonance was changed,

   And strife, the element of hell,

   The young world's harmony deranged.


   Nor ever, since His Sabbath-rest,

   When the great Maker from the skies,

   His finish'd works beheld and bless'd,

   Have songs of glory ceased to rise.


   Where two or three in union meet,

   Or thousands throng the house of prayer,

   Heart-melodies, thanksgivings sweet,

   And faithful vows are offer'd there.


   Now, with all instruments in one,

   All Spirits tuned to one accord,

   Alone hast immortality.


   For in, and through, and over all,

   Extends Thy universal reign;

   We know the heaven of heavens too small,

   Thy power and glory to contain.


   In Sinai's howling wilderness,

   Of old Thy presence deign'd to dwell;

   The Tabernacle stood to bless,

   And guard the tents of Israel.


   So on this yet unpeopled plot,

   Whither the living shall repair,

   And thronging graves surround the spot,

   To Thee shall rise an house of prayer.


   Watch o'er this sanctuary keep,

   And oh! may all who slumber here,

   Redeem'd from sin in Jesus sleep,

   Till He who is their life appear.


   As in His rock-hewn sepulchre,

   Where man had never lain before,

   Thy Son once rested,--we inter

   Our kindred, seen on earth no more.

   God was there, he knew it not,

   Till heaven open'd o'er his head.


   Angels travell'd through his dream,

   Time unveil'd eternity;

   Then came forth a voice from Him,

   Whom no living eye can see.


   "I am God,--thy father's God,

   I will bless thee and increase,

   Give the land which thou hast trod,

   To thy seed, and send them peace."


   Not in visions of the night,

   But in noon of Gospel light,

   Here Thy power and grace display.


   Here, though prayer, since time begun,

   Never have been made before,

   Now, be prayer from sire to son,

   Made till time shall be no more.


   Oft on embassies of love,

   Be descending angels sent,

   And returning spread above

   Joy o'er sinners that repent.


   Here the children's angels see

   Little ones to Jesus brought,

   In Thy nurture train'd for Thee,

   By Thine admonition taught.


   While Thy ministers declare

   All the counsel of Thy will,

   Lord, Thy people's hearts prepare

   Every precept to fulfil.

   While safe, as watch'd by cherubim, thy dust

   Servant of God, well done!

   Rest from thy loved employ!

   The battle fought, the victory won,

   Enter thy Master's joy.


   The voice at midnight came,

   He started up to hear;

   A mortal arrow pierced his frame,

   He fell,--but felt no fear.


   Tranquil amidst alarms,

   It found him on the field,

   A veteran slumbering on his arms,

   Beneath his red-cross shield.


   His sword was in his hand,

   Still warm with recent fight,

   Ready that moment, at command,

   Through rock and steel to smite.


   It was a two-edged blade

   Of heavenly temper, keen;

   And double were the wounds it made,

   Where'er it glanced between.


   'Twas death to sin,--'twas life

   To all who mourn'd for sin;

   It kindled and it silenced strife,

   Made war and peace within.


   Oft with its fiery force

   His arm had quell'd the foe,

   And laid, resistless in his course,

   The alien armies low.


   Bent on such glorious toils,

   The world to him was loss,

   Yet all his trophies, all his spoils,

   He hung upon the Cross.


   At midnight came the cry,

   "To meet thy God prepare!"

   He woke,--and caught his Captain's eye;

   Then, strong in faith and prayer,--


   His spirit, with a bound,

   Left its encumbering clay;

   His tent, at sunrise, on the ground,

   A darken'd ruin lay.


   The pains of death are past,

   Labour and sorrow cease;

   And life's long warfare closed at last,

   His soul is found in peace.


   Soldier of Christ, well done!

   Praise be thy new employ;

   And while eternal ages run,

   Rest in thy Saviour's joy.

   Appeal from Poor Children.


   Friends of the poor, the young, the weak,

   Regard our humble train;

   Compassion at your hands we seek;

   Shall children plead in vain?


   Were you not children once?--Renew

   The time when young as we;

   Think of the friends that nourish'd you,

   And hearken to our plea.


   Are there not feelings from above,

   In every heart that reign?

   The pulse, the voice, the look of love:--

   Shall Nature plead in vain?


   Have you no dear ones round your hearth,

   As weak and young as we?

   Think, if like ours had been their birth,

   Could you resist the plea?


   Have you not known a Saviour's grace,

   For man's redemption slain?

   Behold that Saviour in our place;--

   Shall Jesus plead in vain?


   No;--by His early griefs and tears,

   When poor and young as we;

   By all His woes in after years,

   Accept your Saviour's plea.

   The Erection of a Sunday School.


   A children's temple here we build,

   And consecrate it, Lord, to Thee;

   In hope, that with Thy presence fill'd,

   These humble walls henceforth may be.


   When Christ, Thy Holy Child, was born,

   He had not where to lay His head;

   Though King of kings, He did not scorn

   The meanness of a manger-bed.


   He, who the throne of glory shares,

   Came down, that we, through sovereign love,

   Might be God's children, and God's heirs,

   Joint-heirs with Him in bliss above.


   And is He not to-day the same,

   And deigns He not to visit there,

   Where two or three, in His great Name,

   Are met for worship, praise, and prayer?


   Ah! yes, where simple souls are taught

   To know and do His Father's will,

   Or infants to His arms are brought,

   He welcomes all, and blesses still.


   Come, Holy Ghost! while we draw nigh,

   Such life and power to us afford,

   That each may "Abba, Father!" cry,

   And young and old call Jesus, Lord.

   The Happiness of those who walk with Christ.


   Happy the child, who early makes

   The path of duty his delight,

   The way of wickedness forsakes,

   And walks as in his Maker's sight.


   Happy the youth, whose soul hath found

   Pardon and favour with the Lord;

   True riches shall to him abound,

   True pleasures spring from God's word.


   Happy the man, who trusts in Thee,

   Christ, our Redeemer, strong to save,

   Thy love through life his bliss shall be,

   In death his hope beyond the grave.


   Thrice happy they, who thus are taught

   To seek salvation here below,

   And young or old, determined naught,

   Save Jesus crucified, to know.

   The Souls of Children ransomed by the Death of Christ.


   Lord Jesus Christ, the children's Friend,

   On us lift up Thy gracious hands,

   And from Thy holy temple send

   Blessings on our united bands.


   How precious in Thy Father's sight

   Were children's souls, when Thee He gave,

   His only Son, His heart's delight,

   From hell to heaven those souls to save!


   What love to them, what love was Thine,

   Meek Lamb of God, when Thou didst give

   Thy soul, a sacrifice divine,

   Dying Thyself that they might live!


   Nor less the Holy Spirit's grace,

   When by His light He Thee reveals,

   As though they saw Thee face to face,

   And them as heirs of glory seals.


   Are children's souls of such high price?

   With grief and gladness may we see,

   How sad their loss in Paradise,

   How great their gain on Calvary.


   Our own no longer, Thine thy are,

   In mercy bind them to Thy Cross;

   Safe only from the tempter there,

   From second death and endless loss.

   O Lord our God, Thy light and truth

   To us Thy children send,

   That we may serve Thee in our youth,

   And love Thee to the end.


   By nature sinful, weak, and blind,

   The downward path we trod,

   Our wandering heart and wayward mind

   Were enemies to God.


   But friends and guardians now, through grace,

   Our heedless steps restrain,

   They teach us, Lord, to seek Thy face,

   Which none shall seek in vain.


   Hence to the hills we lift our eyes,

   From which salvation springs;

   O Sun of Righteousness, arise,

   With bealing in Thy wings!


   Arise,--and o'er this vale of tears,

   Shine into perfect day,

   Still heavenward, through progressive years,

   Pointing the Christian's way.

   But youth, health, strength, must soon decay,

   This year--this moment, we may die.


   Brought to the altar of the Lord,

   Eternal enmity, we now

   To sin and Satan would record;

   To Christ eternal homage vow.


   Lord, to Thyself our spirits draw,

   Bind our affections with Thy love;

   Incline our hearts to keep Thy law,

   And fix our hopes on things above.


   The fragrance, dew, and flower of youth,

   The health and strength of Nature's prime,

   We here present;--Oh! Thine in truth

   Be all our talents, all our time.


   Heavenward our course on earth be bent,

   Where'er our future lot is cast;

   And life, thus well and wisely spent,

   Be pure and holy to the last.

   The Heart given to God in acknowledgment of His Blessings.


   PART I.

      Our parents, brothers, sisters, friends,

      We love and hold most dear;

      For these our Heavenly Father sends

      To make us happy here.


      They feed, they clothe, supply our wants,

      And bless us while they live;

      But God, our Heavenly Father, grants

      Blessings they cannot give.


      We call them ours a little while--

      Then one by one departs,

      And we no longer see their smile

      That won our youthful hearts.


      Our Heavenly Father cannot die;

      On Him our souls depend;

      We sleep and wake beneath His eye--

      He loves us to the end.


      He gave us being, gave us breath;

      We feel His constant care;

      We're His through life, we're His in death,

      His we for ever are.


      He to His house, not made with hands,

      Invites us while we roam,

      And at the door our Saviour stands

      To bid its welcome home.


   PART II.

      What doth the Lord, on our poor part,

      Require us to resign?

      "My son," saith He, "give Me thy heart"

      "My daughter! give Me thine."


      Let us on this great jubilee,

      Answer, "Thy will be done;

      We give up all our hearts to Thee:

      Each child now brings Thee one.


      "Take them, and fill them with Thy love--

      Fill till they overflow

      With praise to Thee in heaven above,

      And prayer for all below.


      "May every heart on earth's wide face,

      Of child or man, be given

      To Christ, where'er His Word of Grace

      Is sounded under heaven!"

   Be Clothed with Humility.--I. Peter, v. 5.


   The bird that soars on highest wing,

   Builds on the ground her lowly nest;

   And she that doth most sweetly sing,

   Sings in the shade when all things rest:

   In lark and nightingale we see

   What honour hath humility.


   When Mary chose the "better part,"

   She meekly sat at Jesus' feet

   And Lydia's gently-open'd heart

   Was made for God's own temple meet;

   Fairest and best adorned is she,

   Whose clothing is humility.


   The saint that wears heaven's brightest crown,

   In deepest adoration bends;

   The weight of glory bows him down,

   Then most, when most his soul ascends;

   Nearest the throne itself must be

   The footstool of humility.

   God, in Christ made manifest,

   God, the Spirit, one in three;

   Make Thy children one with Thee.


   Let the glory of Thy face,

   Let the riches of Thy grace,

   Let Thine influence benign,

   Sanctify and seal us Thine.


   Thou art power, and love, and light,

   By that threefold cord unite

   All our schools, with large increase,

   In Thy covenant of peace.


   Then the living, year by year,

   Shall recruit our numbers here,

   And our dying friends supply

   Fresh accessions to the sky.


   Till, at mortal life's last stage,

   Time himself shall die of age,

   Death dethroned, lay down his head

   In that grave where lay his dead.


   Thence may we, in that dread hour,

   Rescued from the tyrant's power,

   With thy saints arise, and sing

   Christ, Death's Conqueror, Christ Our King.

   God the Source of Natural and Spiritual Light.

   (For Sunday School Teachers.)


   God said, "Let there be light!"

   And light sprang forth, new born;

   He spake, 'twas done,--primeval night

   Brake into glorious morn.


   Who then shall dare to say,

   "Let there be darkness"--none

   But ravening wolves that hate the day,

   And owls that fear the sun.


   Stars, from the solar fount,

   Their borrow'd lustre draw;

   Moses came radiant from the mount

   To teach God's holy law.


   Warm from the throne of grace,

   Where we have learnt His will;

   When we go forth may every face

   Express His image still.


   Light in the Lord are we,

   While by His truth we stand,

   Reflecting beams of Deity,

   Like stars in His right hand.


   So shall our schools be found

   As gardens of the Lord,

   And fruits of holiness abound,

   Where'er we plant the Word.

   For a Sunday School Meeting at Whitsuntide.


   With heart and soul, with mind and might,

   In many a glad and grateful throng,

   The aged and the young unite

   To sing their Pentecostal song.


   This day brings sweet remembrances

   Of hallow'd seasons gone before,

   And pledges greater things than these,

   To schools and teachers, still in store.


   Thus every year bequeaths one day

   Of special blessings to record;

   With dear companions by the way,

   While following on to know the Lord.


   A gathering bore on pilgrimage

   Refreshes thousands in their course;

   A field-day here gives those who wage

   War with the world, redoubled force.


   Among the annals of the past,

   This happiest day let us enrol,

   And year by year, while life shall last,

   Inscribe a happier on the scroll.


   Can such a consummation be?--

   This day is ours,--the only one;

   To spend it for eternity

   Will be the good work well begun.

   Unity in Faith, Hope, and Feeling.

   And join our hearts and hands.


   Now all as one, and one as all,

   Faith, feelings, hopes the same,

   On our Lord Jesus Christ we call,

   And glorify His name.


   At once upon ten thousand flowers,

   The morning sunbeams strike,

   Millions of blades of grass--Spring showers

   Baptize from heaven alike.


   So may the Sun of Righteousness

   On our assembly shine,

   And showers of consolation bless

   Our souls with peace divine.


   Hence, when we to our homes return,

   Rejoicing let us say,

   "Did not our hearts within us burn,

   While Christ went all our way?"

   Sabbath School Union.


   On earth we meet again below;

   But shall we ever meet above,

   And all our souls together flow

   In one eternal tide of love?


   Some meet who never met before;

   We bid them welcome on their way:

   And some may part to join no more

   The children's Whitsuntide array.


   While the whole world before us lies,

   May each, whate'er our pilgrim-path,

   Be truly taught, and timely wise

   To follow peace, and flee from wrath:--


   That wrath, which disobedience brought

   On Adam's sin-born progeny;

   That peace, which our Redeemer bought,

   With His own blood, upon the tree.


   So be this temple to the Lord,

   This Sabbath Union, which we build

   Of living stones, upon His Word,

   With His perpetual presence fill'd,


   Death-partings, then, from earth shall be

   Life-meetings in that world above,

   Where life is immortality,--

   An immortality of love.

   Maidens and youths proclaim,

   And hail with voices, hearts, and hands,

   The Son of David's name.


   Hosanna, sound from hill to hill,

   And spread from plain to plain;

   While louder, sweeter, clearer still,

   Woods echo to the strain.


   Hosanna, on the wings of light,

   O'er earth and ocean fly;

   Till morn to eve, and noon to night,

   And heaven to earth reply.


   The city to the country call;

   Let realm with realm accord;

   And this their watchword one and all;

   Hosanna--praise the Lord!


   Hosanna, then, our song shall be;

   Children recalling Christ's Example and His Love.


   When Jesus left His Father's throne,

   He chose an humble birth;

   Like us, unhonour'd and unknown,

   He came to dwell on earth.


   Like Him, may we be found below

   In Wisdom's paths of peace!

   Like Him, in grace and knowledge grow,

   As years and strength increase.


   Jesus pass'd by the rich and great,

   For men of low degree;

   He sanctified our parents' state,

   For poor, like them, was He.


   Sweet were His words, and kind His look,

   When mothers round Him press'd;

   Their infants in His arms He took,

   And on His bosom bless'd.


   Safe from the world's alluring harms,

   Beneath His watchful eye,

   Thus in the circle of His arms,

   May we for ever lie.


   When Jesus into Salem rode,

   The children sang around;

   For joy they pluck'd the palms, and strow'd

   Their garments on the ground.


   Hosanna, our glad voices raise,

   Hosanna to our King;

   Should we forget our Saviour's praise,

   The stones themselves would sing.


   For we have learn'd to love His Name:

   That Name divinely sweet,

   May every pulse through life proclaim,

   And our last breath repeat.

   Children acknowledging the Providence and Goodness of God.


   The children's angels always view

   Their Heavenly Father's face;

   His joyful messengers and true,

   In Providence and Grace:--


   To guard our feeble steps; to keep

   From harm our living breath,

   Watch o'er our senses while we sleep,

   And waft us home in death.


   But not to angels' care alone

   Poor children are consign'd;

   To God Himself our wants are known,

   The Lord to us is kind.


   Yes;--every comfort here below,

   And every hope above;

   All that we have and are, we owe

   To His unfailing love.


   Then let us act as in His sight,

   And on our humble way

   Walk in the liberty of light,

   As children of the day.


   Young though we be and in the prime

   Of life's unfolding powers,

   Of all the moments of our time,

   This, only this is ours.


   We seize it, Lord, before 'tis past;

   We yield ourselves to Thee;

   Thine be our earliest years, our last,

   And our eternity.

   What is the life of man to Thee?

   The longest is not long.


   A thousand years, a day,

   Are equal in Thy sight;

   Our generations pass away,

   Like watches of the night.


   Lord, make us timely wise

   To know our call of grace;

   And with the moment, as it flies,

   Run our appointed race:


   Still keep the end in view,

   Tarry nor turn aside,

   Perils, allurements, bonds break through,

   Most faithful when most tried!


   Thus, till we reach the goal,

   All else we count but loss;

   Nor till we gain the prize,--our soul,--

   Grow weary of the Cross.

   James Montgomery

   The Government of the Tongue.


   The tongue, the tongue, with all its powers,

   Is Thine who made it, Thine, not ours;

   Lord, teach us early to controul,

   That tameless tell-tale of the soul.


   'Twas with the tongue, the serpent's wile

   Did Eve's simplicity beguile;

   'Twas with the tongue fall'n Adam tried,

   His guilt behind her sin to hide.


   The tongue's a sword, a two-edged sword,

   To kill or quicken with a word;

   A key to ope and shut the heart,

   To lock out knowledge or impart.


   With it God's glory we proclaim,

   With it blaspheme His holy Name;

   Here good and evil strangely meet,

   Hence bitter waters flow with sweet.


   Lord, such confusion should not be;

   Thou art all truth, all equity;

   Pure from Thine hand the creature sprung,

   But lost Thine image through the tongue.


   Through it that image be restored;

   Let tongues of fire that preach Thy Word,

   Call, by Thy Holy Spirit's might,

   Souls out of darkness into light.


   Be this our lot:--may heart and tongue

   To heavenly harmony be strung,

   Till every tone Thy love record,

   And every pulse praise Thee the Lord.

   Prayer for Preservation from sinful Words.


   With lawless lips, unbridled tongue,

   In language, wanton or profane,

   Never, good Lord, from us be wrung

   A phrase to take Thy Name in vain.


   For every idle word to Thee,

   As each must give a strict account,

   Well might we tremble, could we see,

   Young as we are, the past amount.


   Since, not by blasphemy alone,

   When sinners curse Thee to Thy face,

   A thought, a sign, a look, a tone,

   May cast upon Thy Name disgrace.


   Thy name they also desecrate,

   Who read Thy Word, who pray, and praise,

   Yet not on Thee in spirit wait,

   Nor honour Thee in all their ways.


   Thy Name!--O by our mouth, that word

   Be never spoken,--in our heart

   Conceived,--or by our ear be heard,

   Without remembering who Thou art:--


   God, from eternity the same,

   For ever blessing, ever blest;

   Holy and reverend is Thy Name,

   Why is it not by all confest?


   Now, fire from heaven, Thy fire of love,

   To sanctify our speech be sent,

   Till, gather'd to the Church above,

   Pure love shall be our element.

   Scriptural Examples of Piety and Obedience in the Young.


   Isaac was ransom'd when he lay

   Upon the altar bound;

   Moses, an infant cast away,

   Pharaoh's own daughter found.


   Joseph, by his false brethren sold,

   God raised above them all;

   To Hannah's child, the Lord foretold,

   How Eli's house must fall.


   David the bear and lion slew

   And o'er Gath's champion trod;

   Josiah, from his boyhood, knew

   His father David's God.


   To good Naomi gentle Ruth

   Clave with a daughter's soul;

   A little maid reveal'd the truth,

   Whence Naaman was made whole.


   Children are thus Jehovah's care;

   Thus youth may seek His face;

   Since His own Son He did not spare,

   With Him He gives all grace:


   Grace, like the young of whom we read,

   Early in Him to trust;

   A Friend in need, a Friend indeed,

   As merciful as just.


   Lord, while like them our course we read,

   And in the footsteps of Thy Son,

   Conduct us to the end.

   Yet, on one sweet hill of rest,

   In whose home, at home He felt.

   Shall see his face no more.


   Yet all whom once he taught

   And seek the blessedness he sought,

   May him in glory meet.


   Mourn, youths and maidens, mourn,

   Whom like a flock he led

   And in green pastures fed.


   Walk in his footsteps here,

   So, in the heavenly fold,

   When the chief Shepherd shall appear,

   Grieve, fellow teachers, grieve;

   With you he bore the Cross,

   And gladly, for a crown of life,

   Accounted all things loss.


   Think with what power he spake,

   While tears his words outran,

   As though his very heart would break

   With love to God and man.


   His eye, his voice, his hand,

   Still marshal you along;

   A fearless, firm, united band,

   Quit you like men,--be strong!

   Faith's strong foundation firm and sure,

   My fix'd abode the heaviest shock

   Of time and tempest to endure.


   Not small, nor large, not low, nor high,

   Midway it stands upon the steep,

   Beneath the storm-mark of the sky,

   Above the flood-work of the deep.


   And here I humbly wait whilst He

   Who pluck'd me from the lowest hell,

   Prepares a heavenly house for me,

   Then calls me home with Him to dwell.

   5.5.5.5 D

   James Montgomery

   Old and Young praising Jesus together.


   O come, let us raise

   Our tribute of song;

   Thanksgiving and praise

   To Jesus belong:--

   He came from above

   Our bliss to begin,

   Make perfect in love,

   And free us from sin.


   The old and the young,

   His people by choice,

   With heart, soul, and tongue,

   In Him may rejoice:--

   We meet Him to-day

   Triumphantly crown'd,

   And welcome His way,

   In chorus around.


   Hosanna!--that word

   To children is dear;

   To Jesus our Lord,

   We'll echo it here;--

   Let worldlings despise,

   And enemies rail,

   Hosannas shall rise,

   Hosannas prevail.


   God's temple shall ring,

   While under His eye,

   Hosanna we sing,

   For Jesus draws nigh:

   Hosanna! our breath

   Through life shall proclaim;

   Hosanna! in death,

   In glory, the same!

HYMN CCCXXXVII.

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   For a Sunday School Anniversary.


   The brightest morning of the year

   Is that which brings the day,

   When Sunday Schools assemble here,

   Their joyful vows to pay.


   The loveliest scene that eyes behold,

   Is band succeeding band,

   Till, fairly form'd with flags unroll'd,

   The children's legions stand.


   The sweetest harmony that floats,

   Is, when, o'er hill and dale,

   From yonder height, their mingling notes

   With rapture swell the gale.


   The purest bliss that life can know,

   Devoid of fear and guile,

   Is, when at once all bosoms glow,

   All faces wear one smile.


   Nor beautiful on earth alone

   This spectacle of love,

   Their angels round their Father's throne

   Bend o'er it from above.


   Great God! fulfill our hearts' desire!

   Make every soul sincere,

   That, in Thy sight, this youthful choir

   May be what they appear.

HYMN CCCXXXVIII.

   6.6.8.6.8.8

   James Montgomery

   Separation on earth--Reunion in heaven.


   Friend after friend departs:

   Who hath not lost a friend?

   There is no union here of hearts,

   That finds not here an end:

   Were this frail world our only rest,

   Living or dying, none were blest.


   Beyond the flight of time,

   Beyond this vale of death,

   There surely is some blessed clime,

   Where life is not a breath;

   Nor life's affections transient fire,

   Whose sparks fly upward to expire!


   There is a world above,

   Where parting is unknown;

   A whole eternity of love,

   Form'd for the good alone;

   And faith beholds the dying here,

   Translated to that happier sphere.


   Thus star by star declines,

   Till all are pass'd away,

   As morning high and higher shines

   To pure and perfect day;

   Nor sink those stars in empty night,--

   They hide themselves in heaven's own light.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   For Wadsley Church Schools. [14]


   Come, from your dwellings, girls and boys,

   Come in your neat though plain array;

   From work and pastime, tools and toys,

   Come to the children's holy day.


   Come from the valley and the hills,

   Round Wadsley Church, by Wharncliffe woods:

   Come from the forges, tilts, and mills

   On Rivelin, Dun, and Loxley floods.


   We gladly answer, while we throng

   Through fields and lanes--We come, we come,

   To sing the children's sweetest song,--

   Stones might cry out if we were dumb.


   Hosanna to our Saviour King,

   Who came from heaven for us to die;

   Hosanna let the moorlands ring,

   Hosanna all their rocks reply.


   At church, in school, this day, good Lord!

   With reverence and with godly fear,

   Teach us to hearken to Thy word,

   And then to practise what we hear.


   Our weakness help, our sins forgive,

   Confirm our faith, our love increase;

   That we may serve Thee while we live

   And when we die, depart in Peace.

   For the Sunday-School Jubilee, the Birthday of Robert Raikes, the
   Founder of Sunday Schools, Sept. 14th, 1831.


   I.

      Let songs of praise arise;

      Teachers, your tribute bring;

      Let hallelujahs fill the skies,

      Earth with hosannas ring.


      Once, by the river-side,

      A little fountain rose;

      Now, like the Severn's sea-ward tide,

      Round the broad world it flows.


      One heaven-directed mind

      Reveal'd the simple plan:

      Now, in the glorious task combined,

      Ten thousand are one man.


      Though poor and mean the place,

      And small the band he taught:

      Millions since then have shared the grace;

      Behold what God hath wrought.


      Through Albion's ocean-isles,

      In near and distant lands,

      Where'er the Christian Sabbath smiles,

      The Sabbath School-house stands.


      Heralds of peace proclaim

      The year of jubilee;

      Now in the Babe of Bethlehem's Name,

      Bid every child go free.

   III.

      Love is the theme of saints above;

      Love be the theme of saints below;

      Love is of God, for God is Love;

      With love let every bosom glow:--


      Love, stronger than the grasp of Death,

      Love that rejoices o'er the grave,

      Love to the Author of our breath,

      Love to His Son, who came to save;--


      Love to the Spirit of all grace,

      Love to the Scriptures of all truth,

      Love to our whole apostate race,

      Love to the aged, love to youth;--


      Love to each other--soul and mind,

      And heart and hand, with full accord,

      In one sweet covenant combined,

      To live and die unto the Lord.


      Christ's little flock we then shall feed,

      The lambs we in our arms shall bear,

      Reclaim the lost, the feeble lead,

      And watch o'er all in faith and prayer.


      Thus through our isle, on all our bands,

      The beauty of the Lord shall be;

      And Britain, glory of all lands,

      Plant Sabbath schools from sea to sea.

HYMN CCCXLII.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   For an Infant School.

   "Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child."--I. Sam. iii. 8.


   Sun, moon and stars, by day and night,

   At God's commandment, give us light,

   And when we wake, and while we sleep,

   Their watch, like guardian angels, keep.


   The bright blue sky above our head,

   The soft green earth on which we tread,

   The ocean rolling round the land,

   Were made by God's almighty hand.


   Sweet flowers that hill and dale adorn,

   Fair fruit-trees, fields of grass and corn,

   The clouds that rise, the showers that fall,

   The winds that blow--God sends them all.


   The beasts that graze with downward eye,

   The birds that perch, and sing, and fly,

   The fishes swimming in the sea,

   God's creatures are as well as we.


   But us He form'd for better things;--

   As servants of the King of kings,

   With lifted hands, and open face,

   And thankful hearts, to seek his grace.


   Thus God loved man, and more than thus,--

   He sent his Son to die for us,

   And now invites us, when we die,

   To come and live with Him on high.


   But we must live to Him below,

   For none but such to heaven will go;--

   Lord Jesus, hear our humble prayer,

   And lead the little children there.

   For the Children of National, British or Sunday Schools.


   Thy throne, O God, in righteousness,

   For ever shall endure;

   We bow before it; deign to bless

   The children of the poor.


   Thy wisdom fix'd our lowly birth,

   Yet we Thy goodness share;

   Still make us while we dwell on earth,

   The children of Thy care.


   Strangers to Thee, though Thine by name,

   We hear Thy welcome voice,

   And gather'd from the world, became

   The children of Thy choice.


   Thou art our Shepherd;--glorious God,

   Thy little flock behold;

   And guide us by Thy staff and rod,--

   The children of Thy fold.


   We praise Thy Name that we were brought

   To this delightful place,

   Where we are watch'd, and warn'd, and taught,--

   The children of Thy grace.


   O may our friends, Thy servants here,

   Meet all our souls above,

   And they and we in heaven appear,

   The children of Thy love!

   8.6.8.6

   James Montgomery

   Hymn for the British Orphan Asylum.


   Thou Father of the fatherless,

   A band of orphans see,

   And from Thy throne of glory bless,

   Our little family:--


   A little family, who share

   No human parents' love;

   And yet for whom Thou wilt prepare

   A house and home above:--


   A home above, if train'd up here,

   In Wisdom's paths to go.

   We travel heavenward in Thy fear,

   From this sweet home below:--


   This home below, where we have found

   Refuge in time of need,

   And meet upon its holy ground,

   Friends, who are friends indeed.


   For friends indeed to us are they,

   Who, for our Saviour's sake,

   Have sought us out, like lambs astray,

   Their bounty to partake:


   Thine is their bounty,--theirs not less,

   Though Thine what each imparts,

   When, to relieve the fatherless,

   Thy love constrains their hearts.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   For the Children in a Charity School.


   While saints and angels, glorious King,

   Day without night Thy praises sing;

   Thou wilt not humbler strains despise,

   The songs of children reach the skies.


   Amidst the whole creation's cares,

   The meanest worm Thy bounty shares;

   Thine eyes the depths of ocean see,

   The grave itself hides not from Thee.


   While want and hardships were our lot,

   Thou knew'st us, though we knew Thee not;

   Now we adore Thine hand that sends,

   Our earthly comforts, home, and friends.


   With these Thy heavenly gifts afford,

   Thy Son, Thy Spirit, and Thy Word:--

   Thy Word to teach our wayward youth,

   Thy pure commandments, God of truth!--


   Thy Spirit to dispel the night

   Of sin and error, God of light!--

   Thy Son, to raise our minds above

   This world's affections, God of love!


   For all the good Thy grace imparts,

   What shall we give Thee?--take our hearts:

   O seal them by Thy power divine,

   In life, in death, for ever Thine.

   James Montgomery

   For Ragged Schools.


   The poorest of the poor are we,

   But precious are our souls to Thee,

   Whom, though Thou art the Lord of all,

   Our Heavenly Father we may call.


   If meanly clad and sparely fed,

   Give us this day our daily bread,

   For all that live and move, and are,

   In Providence, Thy bounty share.


   To Thee, when the young ravens cry,

   Thy hands their humble wants supply;

   Alike on Thee, their unknown Friend,

   The lion and the lamb depend.


   Thine air, Thy sunshine, dews, and showers,

   In season make the lily's flowers

   More beautiful to look upon,

   Than on his throne, King Solomon.


   The widow, old and desolate;

   The orphan in his low estate;

   The slave, the outcast of mankind,

   Thee their almighty Helper, find.


   All times, and every where, Thine eye

   Looks down upon us from the sky;

   Could we look up by light divine,

   Ours might be ever fix'd on Thine.


   While every word we speak, Thine ear

   Through all creation's sounds can hear,

   By ours, if open'd to Thy Word,

   Thy voice from heaven would here be heard.


   Moment on moment, breath by breath,

   Our pilgrim life draws nearer death:

   Each breath, each moment, make us be

   More meet for immortality.


   O God, most merciful and just,

   Shall we not put in Thee our trust?

   In grief and pain, to calm our fears,

   Comfort our hearts, and wipe our tears.

   Poor Children praying for themselves and their benefactors.


   God over all, the sun by day

   Reveals Thy glory in His light;

   The moon and stars Thy voice obey,

   And mark Thy presence through the night.


   God over all, the earth that yields

   Her flowers and fruits at Thy command,

   From mountains, rivers, woods, and fields,

   Pours the rich bounties of Thy hand.


   To us, the poorest of the poor,

   High as Thou art Thy care descends;

   Thy mercies are for ever sure,

   Thou art our Father, these our friends.


   Are these our friends?--Thou God of grace,

   Reward their love a thousand fold;

   And may they ever in Thy face,

   Their best, their dearest friend behold.


   Art Thou our Father?--we confess,

   With grief and shame our sin and guilt;

   O turn from our unrighteousness,

   Look on Thy Son,--His blood was spilt.


   He bore the chastening of Thy rod,

   That we might by His stripes be heal'd;

   He died for us, the Lamb of God!

   He rose, and our redemption seal'd.


   And shall we, dare we, can we still

   Resist Thy fear, Thy love despise?

   No, take us,--soul, affection, will--

   A free and living sacrifice.

HYMN CCCXLVIII.

   8.8.8.8

   James Montgomery

   For Christian Adult Schools. Bristol, 1813.


   Lord! are there eyes that see the sun,

   And gaze with joy on Nature's face,

   Yet while through all Thy works they run,

   Thy glorious Godhead never trace?


   Lord! are there eyes, to which Thy Book

   No hidden mystery reveals?

   O give them power thereon to look;

   "Lion of Judah! break the seals." [15]


   There, with new sight, may they behold

   Thy counsels, since the world began,

   Like morning's gradual beams, unfold

   The wonders of Thy love to man:--


   For whom, a rebel from his birth,

   Thine only Son Thou didst not spare;

   The Lord from heaven came down to earth,

   His guilt and punishment to bear.


   Thus while instruction they receive,

   Thy Spirit's inward light impart,

   Till trembling penitents believe,

   And mercy heals the broken heart.


   Not eyes alone shall then rejoice

   In the rich comforts of Thy word;

   Deaf ears shall hearken to Thy voice,

   And bless the day its sound was heard.


   Tongues, that were meant to pledge Thy Name

   In oaths, and cursings, change their tone,

   Thy free salvation to proclaim,

   And make Thy loving-kindness known.


   Bosoms, by cruel fiends possest,

   Dark dungeons of indwelling sin,

   Are temples with Thy presence blest,

   All glorious, like the ark, within,


   Though earth no lovelier prospect show

   Than children walking in Thy ways;

   And heaven no sweeter music know

   Than infant voices join'd in praise:


   Though such, secured from early vice;

   Water'd by Thy continual care,

   Spring up like trees of Paradise,

   And fruit, in long succession, bear:


   Yet will the tears of transport swell,

   Our spirits pure affection burn,

   When, aged sinners, warn'd of hell,

   Though late and slow, to God return.


   Humbly they take the lowest seat;

   Matrons and hoary-headed men

   Are learners at the Saviour's feet,

   Are "little children" once again.


   Lord! we commit them to Thine hands,

   To Thee their new-born hopes aspire;

   O take them, keep them,--these are brands,

   Pluckt out of everlasting fire.

   Children Schools Nurseries for Paradise.


   Our schools are nurseries below,

   For trees of Paradise to grow,

   Till by their Saviour's training hand,

   Transplanted to the promised land.


   Myriads already, from our care,

   Once our companions flourish there,

   Yet still in fellowship all meet,

   They see His face, we kiss His feet.


   There's joy in heaven among the saints,

   O'er every sinner that repents;

   The children's angels swell that strain,

   When little ones are born again.


   Then be this day of sacred mirth

   A jubilee in heaven and earth;

   Hence while our glad hosannas rise,

   High hallelujahs fill the skies.


   When Time hath run his latest round,

   We learn to praise and pray.


   Ours is the Sunday school,

   Its lessons may we prize,

   And grow by every gospel rule

   So all our lives below,

   In Wisdom's pleasant ways,

   The fruits of Sunday schools shalt show,

   Sunday School Union Jubilee, 1853.


   The grace of Jesus Christ our Lord,

   The Father's love with sweet accord,

   The Holy Ghost's communion be

   Our bond of peace and amity.


   This is the threefold cord that binds

   The sympathies of kindred minds,

   And draws them to that Glorious Three,

   The One eternal Deity.


   Thus God to man Himself reveals,

   His people calls, redeems, and seals,

   Who one with Him in spirit are,

   In answer to Christ's farewell prayer.


   Nor time, nor place, nor life, nor death,

   Decaying strength, departing breath,

   Can loose or break that holy cord,

   Laid on them by their loving Lord.


   This was the very cord of love,

   Which drew Him from His throne above;

   With it He makes Sin's prisoners free,

   And captive leads captivity.


   Bound with this covenant to-day,

   We rest as pilgrims on our way,

   Past trials thankfully review,

   And cheerfully prepare for new.
