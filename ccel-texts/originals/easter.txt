    Psal. 89:48.

    What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?

   At first, God gave the judgement of death upon man, when he should
   transgresse, absolutely, Morte morieris, Thou shalt surely dye: The
   woman in her Dialogue with the Serpent, she mollifies it, Ne fortè
   moriamur, perchance, if we eate, we may die; and then the Devill is as
   peremptory on the other side, Nequaquam moriemini, do what you will,
   surely you shall not die; And now God in this Text comes to his reply,
   Quis est homo, shall they not die? Give me but one instance, but one
   exception to this rule, What man is hee that liveth, and shall not see
   death? Let no man, no woman, no devill offer a Ne fortè, (perchance we
   may dye) much lesse a Nequaquam, (surely we shall not dye) except he be
   provided of an answer to this question, except he can give an instance
   against this generall, except he can produce that mans name, and
   history, that hath lived, and shall not see death. Wee are all
   conceived in close Prison; in our Mothers wombes, we are close
   Prisoners all; when we are borne, we are borne but to the liberty of
   the house; Prisoners still, though within larger walls; and then all
   our life is but a going out to the place of Execution, to death. Now
   was there ever any man seen to sleep in the Cart, between New-gate, and
   Tyborne? between the Prison, and the place of Execution, does any man
   sleep? And we sleep all the way; from the womb to the grave we are
   never thoroughly awake; but passe on with such dreames, and
   imaginations as these, I may live as well, as another, and why should I
   dye, rather then another? but awake, and tell me, sayes this Text, Quis
   homo? who is that other that thou talkest of? What man is he that
   liveth, and shall not see death?

   In these words, we shall first, for our generall humiliation, consider
   the unanswerablenesse of this question, There is no man that lives, and
   shall not see death. Secondly, we shall see, how that modification of
   Eve may stand, fortè moriemur, how there may be a probable answer made
   to this question, that it is like enough, that there are some men that
   live, and shall not see death: And thirdly, we shall finde that truly
   spoken, which the Devill spake deceitfully then, we shall finde the
   Nequaquam verified, we shall finde a direct, and full answer to this
   question; we shall finde a man that lives, and shall not see death, our
   Lord, and Saviour Christ Jesus, of whom both S. Augustine, and
   S. Hierome, doe take this question to be principally asked, and this
   Text to be principally intended. Aske me this question then, of all the
   sons of men, generally guilty of originall sin, Quis homo, and I am
   speechlesse, I can make no answer; Aske me this question of those men,
   which shall be alive upon earth at the last day, when Christ comes to
   judgement, Quis homo, and I can make a probable answer; fortè moriemur,
   perchance they shall die; It is a problematicall matter, and we say
   nothing too peremptorily. Aske me this question without relation to
   originall sin, Quis homo, and then I will answer directly, fully,
   confidently, Ecce homo, there was a man that lived, and was not subject
   to death by the law, neither did he actually die so, but that he
   fulfilled the rest of this verse; Eruit animam de inferno, by his owne
   power, he delivered his soule from the hand of the grave. &gt;From the
   first, this lesson rises, Generall doctrines must be generally
   delivered, All men must die: From the second, this lesson, Collaterall
   and unrevealed doctrines must be soberly delivered, How shall we be
   changed at the last day, we know not so clearly: From the third, this
   lesson arises, Conditionall Doctrines must be conditionally delivered,
   If we be dead with him, we shall be raised with him.

   First then, for the generality, Those other degrees of punishment,
   which God inflicted upon Adam, and Eve, and in them upon us, were as
   absolutely, and illimitedly pronounced, as this of death, and yet we
   see, they are many wayes extended, or contracted; To man it was said,
   In sudore vultus, In the sweat of thy browes, thou shalt eate thy
   bread, and how many men never sweat, till they sweat with eating? To
   the woman it was said, Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall
   rule over thee: and how many women have no desire to their husbands,
   how many over-rule them? Hunger, and thirst, and wearinesse, and
   sicknesse are denounced upon all, and yet if you ask me Quis homo? What
   is the man that hungers and thirsts not, that labours not, that sickens
   not? I can tell you of many, that never felt any of these; but contract
   the question to that one of death, Quis homo? What man is he that shall
   not taste death? And I know none. Whether we consider the Summer
   Solstice, when the day is sixteen houres, and the night but eight, or
   the Winter Solstice, when the night is sixteen houres, and the day but
   eight, still all is but twenty foure houres, and still the evening and
   the morning make but a day: The Patriarchs in the old Testament had
   their Summer day, long lives; we are in the Winter, short lived; but
   Quis homo? Which of them, or us come not to our night in death? If we
   consider violent deaths, casuall deaths, it is almost a scornfull thing
   to see, with what wantonnesse, and sportfulnesse, death playes with us;
   We have seen a man Canon proofe in the time of War, and slain with his
   own Pistoll in the time of peace: We have seen a man recovered after
   his drowning, and live to hang himselfe. But for that one kinde of
   death, which is generall, (though nothing be in truth more against
   nature then dissolution, and corruption, which is death) we are come to
   call that death, naturall death, then which, indeed, nothing is more
   unnaturall; The generality makes it naturall; Moses sayes, that Mans
   age is seventy, and eighty is labour and pain; [1] and yet himselfe was
   more then eighty, and in a good state, and habitude when he said so. No
   length, no strength enables us to answer this Quis homo? What man? &c.

   Take a flat Map, a Globe in plano, and here is East, and there is West,
   as far asunder as two points can be put: but reduce this flat Map to
   roundnesse, which is the true form, and then East and West touch one
   another, and are all one: So consider mans life aright, to be a Circle,
   Pulvis es, & in pulverem reverteris, Dust thou art, and to dust thou
   must return; Nudus egressus, Nudus revertar, [2] Naked I came, and
   naked I must go; In this, the circle, the two points meet, the womb and
   the grave are but one point, they make but one station, there is but a
   step from that to this. This brought in that custome amongst the Greek
   Emperours, that ever at the day of their Coronation, they were
   presented with severall sorts of Marble, that they might then bespeak
   their Tombe. And this brought in that Custome into the Primitive
   Church, that they called the Martyrs dayes, wherein they suffered,
   Natalitia Martyrum, their birth dayes; birth, and death is all one.

   Their death was a birth to them into another life, into the glory of
   God; It ended one Circle, and created another; for immortality, and
   eternity is a Circle too; not a Circle where two points meet, but a
   Circle made at once; This life is a Circle, made with a Compasse, that
   passes from point to point; That life is a Circle stamped with a print,
   an endlesse, and perfect Circle, as soone as it begins. Of this Circle,
   the Mathematician is our great and good God; The other Circle we make
   up our selves; we bring the Cradle, and Grave together by a course of
   nature. Every man does; Mi Gheber, sayes the Originall; It is not Ishe,
   which is the first name of man, in the Scriptures, and signifies
   nothing but a sound, a voyce, a word; a Musicall ayre dyes, and
   evaporates, what wonder if man, that is but Ishe, a sound, dye too? It
   is not Adam, which is another name of man, and signifies nothing but
   red earth; Let it be earth red with blood, (with that murder which we
   have done upon our selves) let it be earth red with blushing, (so the
   word is used in the Originall) with a conscience of our own infirmity,
   what wonder if man, that is but Adam, guilty of this self-murder in
   himself, guilty of this in-borne frailty in himself, dye too? It is not
   Enos, which is also a third name of man, and signifies nothing but a
   wretched and miserable creature; what wonder if man, that is but earth,
   that is a burden to his Neighbours, to his friends, to his kindred, to
   himselfe, to whom all others, and to whom himself desires death, what
   wonder if he dye? But this question is framed upon none of these names;
   Not Ishe, not Adam, not Enos; but it is Mi Gheber, Quis vir; which is
   the word alwayes signifying a man accomplished in all excellencies, a
   man accompanied with all advantages; fame, and good opinion justly
   conceived, keepes him from being Ishe, a meere sound, standing onely
   upon popular acclamation; Innocency and integrity keepes him from being
   Adam, red earth, from bleeding, or blushing at any thing hee hath done;
   That holy and Religious Art of Arts, which S. Paul professed, That he
   knew how to want, and how to abound, keepes him from being Enos,
   miserable or wretched in any fortune; Hee is Gheber, a great Man, and a
   good Man, a happy Man, and a holy Man, and yet Mi Gheber, Quis homo,
   this man must see death.

   And therefore we will carry this question a little higher, from Quis
   homo, to Quis deorum, Which of the gods have not seene death? Aske it
   of those, who are Gods by participation of Gods power, of those of whom
   God saies, Ego dixi, dii estis, and God answers for them, and of them,
   and to them, You shall dye like men; Aske it of those gods, who are
   gods by imputation, whom Creatures have created, whom Men have made
   gods, the gods of the Heathen, and do we not know, where all these gods
   dyed? Sometimes divers places dispute, who hath their tombes; but do
   not they deny their godhead in confessing their tombes? doe they not
   all answer, that they cannot answer this text, Mi Gheber, Quis homo,
   What man, Quis deorum, What god of mans making hath not seen death? As
   Iustin Martyr asks that question, Why should I pray to Apollo or
   Esculapius for health, Qui apud Chironem medicinam didicerunt, when I
   know who taught them all that they knew? so why should I looke for
   Immortality from such or such a god, whose grave I finde for a
   witnesse, that he himselfe is dead? Nay, carry this question higher
   then so, from this Quis homo, to quid homo, what is there in the nature
   and essence of Man, free from death? The whole man is not, for the
   dissolution of body and soule is death. The body is not; I shall as
   soon finde an immortall Rose, an eternall Flower, as an immortall body.
   And for the Immortality of the Soule, It is safelier said to be
   immortall, by preservation, then immortall by nature; That God keepes
   it from dying, then, that it cannot dye. We magnifie God in an humble
   and faithfull acknowledgment of the immortality of our soules, but if
   we aske, quid homo, what is there in the nature of Man, that should
   keepe him from death, even in that point, the question is not easily
   answered.

   It is every mans case then; every man dyes; and though it may perchance
   be but a meere Hebraisme to say, that every man shall see death,
   perchance it amounts to no more, but to that phrase, Gustare mortem, To
   taste death, yet thus much may be implied in it too, That as every man
   must dye, so every man may see, that he must dye; as it cannot be
   avoided, so it may be understood. A beast dyes, but he does not see
   death; S. Basil sayes, he saw an Oxe weepe for the death of his
   yoke-fellow; [3] but S. Basil might mistake the occasion of that Oxes
   teares. Many men dye too, and yet doe not see death; The approaches of
   death amaze them, and stupifie them; they feele no colluctation with
   Powers, and Principalities, upon their death bed; that is true; they
   feele no terrors in their consciences, no apprehensions of Judgement,
   upon their death bed; that is true; and this we call going away like a
   Lambe. But the Lambe of God had a sorrowfull sense of death; His soule
   was heavy unto death, and he had an apprehension, that his Father had
   forsaken him; And in this text, the Chalde Paraphrase expresses it
   thus, Videbit Angelum mortis, he shall see a Messenger, a forerunner, a
   power of Death, an executioner of Death, he shall see something with
   horror, though not such as shall shake his morall, or his Christian
   constancy.

   So that this Videbunt, They shall see, implies also a Viderunt, they
   have seene, that is, they have used to see death, to observe a death in
   the decay of themselves, and of every creature, and of the whole
   Worlde. Almost fourteene hundred yeares ago, S. Cyprian writing against
   Demetrianus, who imputed all the warres, and deaths, and
   unseasonablenesses of that time, to the contempt, and irreligion of the
   Christians, that they were the cause of all those ils, because they
   would not worship their Gods, Cyprian imputes all those distempers to
   the age of the whole World; Canos videmus in pueris, saies hee, Wee see
   children borne gray-headed; Capilli deficiunt, antequam crescant, Their
   haire is changed, before it be growne. Nec aetas in senectute desinit,
   sed incipit a senectute, Wee doe not dye with age, but wee are borne
   old. Many of us have seene Death in our particular selves; in many of
   those steps, in which the morall Man expresses it; Wee have seene
   Mortem infantiae, pueritiam, [4] The death of infancy in youth; and
   Pueritiae, adolescentiam, and the death of youth in our middle age; And
   at last we shall see Mortem senectutis, mortem ipsam, the death of age
   in death it selfe. But yet after that, a step farther then that Morall
   man went, Mortem mortis in morte Iesu, We shall see the death of Death
   it self in the death of Christ. As we could not be cloathed at first,
   in Paradise, till some Creatures were dead, (for we were cloathed in
   beasts skins) so we cannot be cloathed in Heaven, but in his garment
   who dyed for us.

   This Videbunt, this future sight of Death implies a viderunt, they have
   seene, they have studied Death in every Booke, in every Creature; and
   it implies a Vident, they doe presently see death in every object, They
   see the houre-glasse running to the death of the houre; They see the
   death of some prophane thoughts in themselves, by the entrance of some
   Religious thought of compunction, and conversion to God; and then they
   see the death of that Religious thought, by an inundation of new
   prophane thoughts, that overflow those. As Christ sayes, that as often
   as wee eate the Sacramentall Bread, we should remember his Death, so as
   often, as we eate ordinary bread, we may remember our death; [5] for
   even hunger and thirst, are diseases; they are Mors quotidiana, [6] a
   daily death, and if they lasted long, would kill us. In every object
   and subject, we all have, and doe, and shall see death; not to our
   comfort as an end of misery, not onely as such a misery in it selfe, as
   the Philosopher takes it to be, Mors omnium miseriarum, That Death is
   the death of all miserie, because it destroyes and dissolves our
   beeing; but as it is Stipendium peccati, The reward of sin; That as
   Solomon sayes, Indignatio Regis nuncius mortis, [7] The wrath of the
   King, is as a messenger of Death, so Mors nuncius indignationis Regis,
   We see in Death a testimony, that our Heavenly King is angry; for, but
   for his indignation against our sinnes, we should not dye. And this
   death, as it is Malum, ill, (for if ye weigh it in the Philosophers
   balance, it is an annihilation of our present beeing, and if ye weigh
   it in the Divine Balance, it is a seale of Gods anger against sin) so
   this death is generall; of this, this question there is no answer, Quis
   homo, What man, &c.

   We passe then from the Morte moriemini, to the fortè moriemini, from
   the generality and the unescapableness of death, from this question, as
   it admits no answer, to the Forte moriemini, perchance we shall dye;
   that is, to the question as it may admit a probable answer. Of which,
   we said at first, that in such questions, nothing becomes a Christian
   better than sobriety; to make a true difference betweene
   problematicall, and dogmaticall points, betweene upper buildings, and
   foundations, betweene collaterall doctrines, and Doctrines in the right
   line: for fundamentall things, Sine haesitatione credantur, [8] They
   must be beleeved without disputing; there is no more to be done for
   them, but beleeving; for things that are not so, we are to weigh them
   in two balances, in the balance of Analogy, and in the balance of
   scandall: we must hold them so, as may be analogall, proportionable,
   agreeable to the Articles of our Faith, and we must hold them so, as
   our brother be not justly offended, nor scandalized by them; wee must
   weigh them with faith, for our own strength, and we must weigh them
   with charity, for others weaknesse. Certainly nothing endangers a
   Church more, then to draw indifferent things to be necessary; I meane
   of a primary necessity, of a necessity to be beleeved De fide, not a
   secondary necessity, a necessity to be performed and practised for
   obedience: Without doubt, the Roman Church repents now, and sees now
   that she should better have preserved her selfe, if they had not denied
   so many particular things, which were indifferently and problematically
   disputed before, to be had necessarily De fide, in the Councell of
   Trent.

   Taking then this Text for a probleme, Quis homo, What man lives, and
   shall not see Death? we answer, It may be that those Men, whom Christ
   shal find upon the earth alive, at his returne to Judge the World,
   shall dye then, and it may be they shall but be changed, and not dye.
   That Christ shall judge quick and dead, is a fundamentall thing; we
   heare it in S. Peters Sermon, to Cornelius and his company, [9] and we
   say it every day in the Creed, Hee shall judge the quick and the dead.
   But though we doe not take the quick and the dead, as Augustine and
   Chrysostome doe, for the Righteous which lived in faith, and the
   unrighteous, which were dead in sinne, Though wee doe not take the
   quick and the dead, as Ruffinus and others doe, for the soule and the
   body, (He shall judge the soule, which was alwaies alive, and he shall
   the body, which was dead for a time) though we take the words (as
   becomes us best) literally, yet the letter does not conclude, but that
   they, whom Christ shall finde alive upon earth, shall have a present
   and sudden dissolution, and a present and sudden re-union of body and
   soul again. Saint Paul sayes, Behold I shew you a mystery; [10]
   Therefore it is not a cleare case, and presently, and peremptorily
   determined; but what is it? We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
   changed. But whether this sleeping be spoke of death it self, and
   exclude that, that we shall not die, or whether this sleep be spoke of
   a rest in the grave, and exclude that, we shall not be buried, and
   remain in death, that may be a mystery still. S. Paul sayes too, The
   dead in Christ shall rise first; Then we which are alive, and remain,
   shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord
   in the ayre. [11] But whether that may not still be true, that
   S. Augustine sayes, that there shall be Mors in raptu, An instant and
   sudden dis-union, and re-union of body and soul, which is death, who
   can tell? So on the other side, when it is said to him, in whom all we
   were, to Adam, Pulvis es, [12] Dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt
   return, when it is said, In Adam all die, [13] when it is said, Death
   passed upon all men, for all have sinned, [14] Why may not all those
   sentences of Scripture, which imply a necessity of dying, admit that
   restriction, Nisi dies judicii naturae cursum immutet, [15] We shall
   all die, except those, in whom the comming of Christ shall change the
   course of Nature.

   Consider the Scriptures then, and we shall be absolutely concluded
   neither way; Consider Authority, and we shall finde the Fathers for the
   most part one way, and the Schoole for the most part another; Take
   later men, and all those in the Romane Church; Then Cajetan thinks,
   that they shall not die, and Catharin is so peremptory, that they
   shall, as that he sayes of the other opinion, Falsam esse confidenter
   asserimus, & contra Scripturas satis manifestas, & omnino sine ratione;
   It is false, and against Scriptures, and reason, saith he; Take later
   men, and all those in the reformed Church; and Calvin sayes, Quia
   aboletur prior natura, censetur species mortis, sed non migrabit anima
   à corpore: S. Paul calls it death, because it is a destruction of the
   former Beeing; but it is not truly death, saith Calvin; and Luther
   saith, That S. Pauls purpose in that place is only to shew the
   suddennesse of Christs comming to Judgement, Non autem inficiatur omnes
   morituros; nam dormire, est sepeliri: But S. Paul doth not deny, but
   that all shall die; for that sleeping which he speaks of, is buriall;
   and all shall die, though all shall not be buried, saith Luther.

   Take then that which is certain; It is certain, a judgement thou must
   passe; If thy close and cautelous proceeding have saved thee from all
   informations in the Exchequer, thy clearnesse of thy title from all
   Courts at Common Law, thy moderation from the Chancery, and
   Star-Chamber, If heighth of thy place, and Authority, have saved thee,
   even from the tongues of men, so that ill men dare not slander thy
   actions, nor good men dare not discover thy actions, no not to thy
   self, All those judgements, and all the judgements of the world, are
   but interlocutory judgements; There is a finall judgement, In
   judicantes & judicatos, against Prisoners and Judges too, where all
   shalbe judged again; Datum est omne judicium, [16] All judgement is
   given to the Son of man, and upon all the sons of men must his
   judgement passe. A judgement is certain, and the uncertainty of this
   judgement is certain too; perchance God will put off thy judgement;
   thou shalt not die yet; but who knows whether God in his mercy, do put
   off this judgement, till these good motions which his blessed Spirit
   inspires into thee now, may take roote, and receive growth, and bring
   forth fruit, or whether he put it off, for a heavier judgement, to let
   thee see, by thy departing from these good motions, and returning to
   thy former sins, after a remorse conceived against those sins, that
   thou art inexcusable even to thy self, and thy condemnation is just,
   even to thine own conscience. So perchance God will bring this
   judgement upon thee now; now thou maist die; but whether God will bring
   that judgement upon thee now, in mercy, whilest his Graces, in his
   Ordinance of preaching, work some tendernesse in thee, and give thee
   some preparation, some fitnesse, some courage to say, Veni Domine Iesu,
   Come Lord Iesu, come quickly, come now, or whether he will come now in
   judgement, because all this can work no tendernesse in thee, who can
   tell?

   Thou hearest the word of God preached, as thou hearest an Oration, with
   some gladnesse in thy self, if thou canst heare him, and never be moved
   by his Oratory; thou thinkest it a degree of wisdome, to be above
   perswasion; and when thou art told, that he that feares God, feares
   nothing else, thou thinkest thy self more valiant then so, if thou
   feare not God neither; Whether or why God defers, or hastens the
   judgement, we know not; This is certain, this all S. Pauls places
   collineate to, this all the Fathers, and all the Schoole, all the
   Cajetans, and all the Catharins, all the Luthers, and all the Calvins
   agree in, A judgement must be, and it must be In ictu oculi, In the
   twinkling of an eye, and Fur in nocte, A thiefe in the night. Make the
   question, Quis homo? What man is he that liveth, and shall not passe
   this judgement? or, what man is he that liveth, and knowes when this
   judgement shall be? So it is a Nemo scit, A question without an answer;
   but as it, as in the text, Quis homo? Who liveth, and shall not die? so
   it is a problematicall matter; and in such things as are
   problematicall, if thou love the peace of Sion, be not too inquisitive
   to know, nor too vehement, when thou thinkest thou doest know it.

   Come then to ask this question, not problematically, (as it is
   contracted to them that shall live in the last dayes) nor peremptorily
   of man, (as he is subject to originall sin) but at large, so, as the
   question may include Christ himself, and then to that Quis homo? What
   man is he? We answer directly, here is the man that shall not see
   death; And of him principally, and literally, S. Augustine (as we said
   before) takes this question to be framed; Vt quaeras, dictum, non ut
   desperes, saith he, this question is moved, to move thee to seek out,
   and to have thy recourse to that man which is the Lord of Life, not to
   make thee despaire, that there is no such man, in whose self, and in
   whom, for all us, there is Redemption from death; For, sayes he, this
   question is an exception to that which was said before the text; which
   is, Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? Consider it better, sayes
   the Holy Ghost, here, and it will not prove so; Man is not made in vain
   at first, though he doe die now; for, Perditio tua ex te, This death
   proceeds from man himself; and Quare moriemini domus Israel? Why will
   ye die, O house of Israel? God made not death, neither hath he pleasure
   in the destruction of the living; [17] The Wise man sayes it, and the
   true God sweares it, As I live saith the Lord, I would not the death of
   a sinner. God did not create man in vain then, though he die; not in
   vain, for since he will needs die, God receives glory even by his
   death, in the execution of his justice; not in vaine neither, because
   though he be dead, God hath provided him a Redeemer from death, in his
   mercy; Man is not created in vain at all; nor all men, so neare vanity
   as to die; for here is one man, God and Man Christ Jesus, which liveth,
   and shall not see death. And conformable to S. Augustines purpose,
   speaks S. Hierome too, Scio quòd nullus homo carneus evadet, sed novi
   Deum sub velamento carnis latentem; I know there is no man but shall
   die; but I know where there is a God clothed in mans flesh, and that
   person cannot die.

   But did not Christ die then? Shall we joyne with any of those
   Heretiques, which brought Christ upon the stage to play a part, and say
   he was born, or lived, or dyed, In phantasmate, In apparance only, and
   representation; God forbid; so all men were created in vain indeed, if
   we had not in him a regeneration in his true death. Where is the
   contract between him, and his Father, that Oportuit pati, All this
   Christ ought to suffer, and so enter into glory: Is that contract void,
   and of none effect? Must he not die? Where is the ratification of that
   contract in all the Prophets? Where is Esays Vere languores nostros
   tulit, Surely he hath born our sorrows; and, he made his grave with the
   wicked in his death; [18] Is the ratification of the Prophets
   cancelled? Shall he not, must he not die? Where is the consummation,
   and the testification of all this? Where is the Gospell, Consummatum
   est? And he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost? Is that fabulous?
   Did he not die? How stands the validity of that contract, Christ must
   die; the dignity of those Prophecies, Christ will die; the truth of the
   Gospell, Christ did die, with this answer to this question, Here is a
   man that liveth and shall not see death? Very well; For though Christ
   Jesus did truly die, so as was contracted, so as was prophecied, so as
   was related, yet hee did not die so, as was intended in this question,
   so as other naturall men do die.

   For first, Christ dyed because he would dye; other men admitted to the
   dignity of Martyrdome, are willing to dye; but they dye by the torments
   of the Executioners, they cannot bid their soules goe out, and say, now
   I will dye. And this was Christs case: It was not only, I lay down my
   life for my sheep, [19] but he sayes also, No man can take away my
   soule; And, I have power to lay it down; And De facto, he did lay it
   down, he did dye, before the torments could have extorted his soule
   from him; Many crucified men lived many dayes upon the Crosse; The
   thieves were alive, long after Christ was dead; and therefore Pilate
   wondred, that he was already dead. [20] His soule did not leave his
   body by force, but because he would, and when he would, and how he
   would; [21] Thus far then first, this is an answer to this question,
   Quis homo? Christ did not die naturally, nor violently, as all others
   doe, but only voluntarily.

   Again, the penalty of death appertaining only to them, who were derived
   from Adam by carnall, and sinfull generation, Christ Jesus being
   conceived miraculously of a Virgin, by the over-shadowing of the Holy
   Ghost, was not subject to the Law of death; and therefore in his
   person, it is a true answer to this Quis homo? Here is a man, that
   shall not see death, that is, he need not see death, he hath not
   incurred Gods displeasure, he is not involved in a general rebellion,
   and therfore is not involved in the generall mortality, not included in
   the generall penalty. He needed not have dyed by the rigour of any Law,
   all we must; he could not dye by the malice, or force of any
   Executioner, all we must; at least by natures generall Executioners,
   Age, and Sicknesse; And then, when out of his own pleasure, and to
   advance our salvation, he would dye, yet he dyed so, as that though
   there were a dis-union of body and soule, (which is truly death) yet
   there remained a Nobler, and faster union, then that of body and soule,
   the Hypostaticall Union of the God-head, not onely to his soule, but to
   his body too; so that even in his death, both parts were still, not
   onely inhabited by, but united to the Godhead it selfe; and in respect
   of that inseparable Union, we may answer to this question, Quis homo?
   Here is a man that shall not see death, that is, he shall see no
   separation of that, which is incomparably, and incomprehensibly, a
   better soul then his soule, the God-head shall not be separated from
   his body.

   But, that which is indeed the most direct, and literall answer, to this
   question, is, That whereas the death in this Text, is intended of such
   a death, as hath Dominion over us, and from which we have no power to
   raise our selves, we may truly, and fully answer to his Quis homo? here
   is a man, that shall never see death so, but that he shall even in the
   jawes, and teeth of death, and in the bowels and wombe of the grave,
   and in the sink, and furnace of hell it selfe, retaine an Almighty
   power, and an effectuall purpose, to deliver his soule from death, by a
   glorious, a victorious, and a Triumphant Resurrection: So it is true,
   Christ Jesus dyed, else none of us could live; but yet hee dyed not so,
   as is intended in this question; Not by the necessity of any Law, not
   by the violence of any Executioner, not by the separation of his best
   soule, (if we may so call it) the God-head, nor by such a separation of
   his naturall, and humane soule, as that he would not, or could not, or
   did not resume it againe.

   If then this question had beene asked of Angels at first, Quis Angelus?
   what Angel is that, that stands, and shall not fall? though as many of
   those Angels, as were disposed to that answer, Erimus similes
   Altissimo, We will be like God, and stand of our selves, without any
   dependance upon him, did fall, yet otherwise they might have answered
   the question fairly, All we may stand, if we will; If this question had
   been asked of Adam in Paradise, Quis homo? though when he harkned to
   her, who had harkned to that voyce, Eritis sicut Dii, You shall be as
   Gods, he fell too, yet otherwise, he might have answered the question
   fairly so, I may live, and not dye, if I will; so, if this question be
   asked of us now, as the question implies the generall penalty, as it
   considers us onely as the sons of Adam, we have no other answer, but
   that by Adam sin entred upon all, and death by sin upon all; as it
   implies the state of them onely, whom Christ at his second comming
   shall finde upon earth, wee have no other answer but a modest, non
   liquet, we are not sure, whether we shall dye then, or no; wee are
   onely sure, it shall be so, as most conduces to our good, and Gods
   glory; but as the question implies us to be members of our Head, Christ
   Jesus, as it was a true answer in him, it is true in every one of us,
   adopted in him, Here is a man that liveth, and shall not see death.

   Death and life are in the power of the tongue, sayes Solomon, [22] in
   another sense; and in this sense too, If my tongue, suggested by my
   heart, and by my heart rooted in faith, can say, Non moriar, non
   moriar; If I can say, (and my conscience doe not tell me, that I belye
   mine owne state) if I can say, That the blood of my Saviour runs in my
   veines, That the breath of his Spirit quickens all my purposes, that
   all my deaths have their Resurrection, all my sins their remorses, all
   my rebellions their reconciliations, I will harken no more after this
   question, as it is intended de morte naturali, of a naturall death, I
   know I must die that death, what care I? nor de morte spirituali, the
   death of sin, I know I doe, and shall die so; why despaire I? but I
   will finde out another death, mortem raptus, a death of rapture, and of
   extasie, that death which S. Paul died more then once, [23] The death
   which S. Gregory speaks of, Divina contemplatio quoddam sepulchrum
   animae, The contemplation of God, and heaven, is a kinde of buriall,
   and Sepulchre, and rest of the soule; and in this death of rapture, and
   extasie, in this death of the Contemplation of my interest in my
   Saviour, I shall finde my self, and all my sins enterred, and entombed
   in his wounds, and like a Lily in Paradise, out of red earth, I shall
   see my soule rise out of his blade, in a candor, and in an innocence,
   contracted there, acceptable in the sight of his Father.

   Though I have been dead, in the delight of sin, so that that of
   S. Paul, That a Widow that liveth in pleasure, is dead while she
   liveth, [24] be true of my soule, that so, viduatur, gratiâ mortuâ,
   when Christ is dead, not for the soule, but in the soule, that the
   soule hath no sense of Christ, Viduatur anima, the soul is a Widow, and
   no Dowager, she hath lost her husband, and hath nothing from him; yea
   though I have made a Covenant with death, and have been at an agreement
   with hell, [25] and in a vain confidence have said to my self, that
   when the overflowing scourge shall passe through, it shall not come to
   me, yet God shall annull that covenant; he shall bring that scourge,
   that is, some medicinall correction upon me, and so give me a
   participation of all the stripes of his son; he shall give me a sweat,
   that is, some horrour, and religious feare, and so give me a
   participation of his Agony; he shall give me a diet, perchance want,
   and penury, and so a participation of his fasting; and if he draw
   blood, if he kill me, all this shall be but Mors raptus, a death of
   rapture towards him, into a heavenly, and assured Contemplation, that I
   have a part in all his passion, yea such an intire interest in his
   whole passion, as though all that he did, or suffered, had been done,
   and suffered for my soule alone; Quasi moriens, & ecce vivo: [26] some
   shew of death I shall have, for I shall sin; and some shew of death
   again, for I shall have a dissolution of this Tabernacle; Sed ecce
   vivo, still the Lord of life will keep me alive, and that with an Ecce,
   Behold, I live; that is, he will declare, and manifest my blessed state
   to me; I shall not sit in the shadow of death; no nor shall I not sit
   in darknesse; his gracious purpose shall evermore be upon me, and I
   shall ever discerne that gracious purpose of his; I shall not die, nor
   I shall not doubt that I shall; If I be dead within doores, (If I have
   sinned in my heart) why, Suscitavit in domo, Christ gave a Resurrection
   to the Rulers daughter within doores, in the house; [27] If I be dead
   in the gate, (If I have sinned in the gates of my soul) in mine Eies,
   or Eares, or Hands, in actuall sins, why, Suscitavit in porta, Christ
   gave a Resurrection to the young man at the gate of Naim. [28] If I be
   dead in the grave, (in customary, and habituall sins) why, Suscitavit
   in Sepulchro, Christ gave a Resurrection to Lazarus in the grave too.
   [29] If God give me mortem raptus, a death of rapture, of extasie, of
   fervent Contemplation of Christ Jesus, a Transfusion, a
   Transplantation, a Transmigration, a Transmutation into him, (for good
   digestion brings alwaies assimilation, certainly, if I come to a true
   meditation upon Christ, I come to a conformity with Christ) this is
   principally that Pretiosa mors Sanctorum, [30] Pretious in the sight of
   the Lord, is the death of his Saints, by which they are dead and
   buryed, and risen again in Christ Jesus; pretious is that death, by
   which we apply that pretious blood to our selves, and grow strong
   enough by it, to meet Davids question, Quis homo? what man? with
   Christs answer, Ego homo, I am the man, in whom whosoever abideth,
   shall not see death.
