PREFACE

   The Remarks prefixed to the first volume of this Translation of the
   Aurea Catena, apply in their substance to the following portion of it,
   which contains the Commentary on S. Mark. Wherever the variations from
   the original writers were such as to destroy the sense of the passage,
   the true reading has been followed, and has been placed in the margin.
   In other cases the text has been translated, as it is found in S.
   Thomas.

   Many of the passages ascribed to S. Chrysostom are not found in the
   works of that Father. Most of these occur also in a Greek Catena on S.
   Mark, published by Possinus, from a MS. in the Library of the
   Archbishop of Tolouse, and still more of them in the Edition which has
   been recently printed by the Oxford University Press, from a MS. in the
   Bodleian. A Latin Version of this Catena or Commentary had previously
   been published by Peltanus, and is found in the Bibliotheca Patrum; and
   contains far the greater number of the same passages marked as S.
   Chrysostom's in the Catena Aurea. It is commonly ascribed to Victor of
   Antioch; though by some, with probability, to S. Cyril of Alexandria. A
   Commentary on a portion of S. Mark published by Wastel, who gives the
   authorship of it and of the Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum to John of
   Jerusalem, also contains a number of the same passages which S. Thomas
   ascribes to S. Chrysostom. Some of the extracts marked "Cyril" are
   found in a Commentary of S. Cyril of Alexandria on S. Luke, lately
   published . by Mai.

   The passages ascribed to S. Jerome, are taken from a Commentary found
   among his works, but universally pronounced to be spurious. It has been
   ascribed to Pelagius, but with more probability to Philippus Presbyter,
   a friend and disciple of S. Jerome. It is entirely mystical, and is in
   many places hopelessly obscure.

   For the translation of the Volume now presented to the reader, the
   Editors have to make their acknowledgments to JOHN DOBBEE DALGAIRNS, M.
   A. of Exeter College.

Chapter 1

   Ver. 1: The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jerome, in Prolog: Mark the Evangelist, who served the priesthood in
   Israel, according to the flesh a Levite, having been converted to the
   Lord, wrote his Gospel in Italy, shewing in it how even his family
   benefited Christ. For commencing his Gospel with the voice of the
   prophetic cry, he shews the order of the election of Levi, declaring
   that John the son of Zachariah was sent forth by the voice of an angel,
   and saying, "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of
   God."

   Pseudo-Jerome: The Greek word Evangelium' means good tidings, in Latin
   it is explained, bona annunciatio,' or, the good news; these terms
   properly belong to the kingdom of God and to the remission of sins; for
   the Gospel is that by which comes the redemption of the faithful and
   the beatitude of the saints.

   But the four Gospels are one, and one Gospel in four. In Hebrew, His
   name is Jesus, in Greek, Soter, in Latin, Salvator; but men say
   Christus in Greek, Messias in Hebrew, Unctus in Latin, that is, King
   and Priest.

   Bede, in Marc., i, 1: The beginning of this Gospel should be compared
   with that of Matthew, in which it is said, "The book of the generation
   of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham." But here He is
   called "the Son of God."

   Now from both we must understand one Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, and
   of man. And fitly the first Evangelist names Him "Son of man," the
   second, "Son of God," that from less things our sense may by degrees
   mount up to greater, and by faith and the sacraments of the human
   nature assumed, rise to the acknowledgment of His divine eternity.

   Fitly also did He, who was about to describe His human generation,
   begin with a son of man, namely, David or Abraham. Fitly again, he who
   was beginning his book with the first preaching of the Gospel, chose
   rather to call Jesus Christ, "the Son of God;" for it belonged to the
   human nature to take upon Him the reality of our flesh, of the race of
   the patriarchs, and it was the work of Divine power to preach the
   Gospel to the world.

   Hilary, de Trin., iii, 11: He has testified, that Christ was the Son of
   God, not in name only, but by His own proper nature. We are the sons of
   God, but He is not a son as we are; for He is the very and proper Son,
   by origin, not by adoption; in truth, not in name; by birth, not by
   creation.

   2. As it is written in the Prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger
   before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee." [Mal 3:1]

   3. "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
   the Lord, make his paths straight." [Isa 40:3]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: Being about to write his Gospel, Mark rightly puts first the
   testimonies of the Prophets, that he might notify to all, that what he
   should write was to be received without scruple of doubt, in that he
   shewed that these things were beforehand foretold by the Prophets. At
   once, by one and the same beginning of his Gospel, he prepared the
   Jews, who had received the Law and the Prophets, for receiving the
   grace of the Gospel, and those sacraments, which their own prophecies
   had foretold; and he also calls upon the Gentiles, who came to the Lord
   by publishing of the Gospel, to receive and venerate the authority of
   the Law and the Prophets; whence he says, "As it is written in the
   prophet Isaiah, Behold, &c."

   Jerome: Hierom. ad Pammach, Epist 57: But this is not written in
   Isaiah, but in Malachi, the last of the twelve prophets.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But it may be said that it
   is a mistake of the writer. Otherwise it may be said that he has
   compressed into one, two prophecies delivered in different places by
   two prophets; for in the prophet Isaiah it is written after the story
   of Hezekiah, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness;" but in
   Malachi, "Behold, I send mine angel."

   The Evangelist therefore, taking parts of two prophecies, has put them
   down as spoken by Isaiah, and refers them here to one passage, without
   mentioning, however, by whom it is said, "Behold, I send mine angel."

   Pseudo-Aug., Quaest. nov. et vet. Test. lvii: For knowing that all
   things are to be referred to their author, he has brought these sayings
   back to Isaiah, who was the first to intimate the sense.

   Lastly, after the words of Malachi, he immediately subjoins, "The voice
   of one crying in the wilderness," in order to connect the words of each
   prophet, belonging as they do to one meaning, under the person of the
   elder prophet.

   Bede: Or otherwise, we must understand, that although these words are
   not found in Isaiah, still the sense of them is found in many other
   places, and most clearly in this which he has subjoined, "The voice of
   one crying in the wilderness." For that which Malachi has called, the
   angel to be sent before the face of the Lord, to prepare His way, is
   the same thing as Isaiah has said is to be heard, "the voice of one
   crying in the wilderness, saying, Prepare ye the way of the Lord."

   But in each sentence alike, the way of the Lord to be prepared is
   proclaimed. It may be, too, that Isaiah occurred to the mind of Mark,
   in writing his Gospel, instead of Malachi, as often happens; which he
   would, however, without doubt correct, at least when reminded by other
   persons, who might read his work whilst he was yet in the flesh; unless
   he though that, since his memory was then ruled by the Holy Spirit, it
   was not without a purpose that the name of one prophet had occurred to
   him instead of another. For thus whatsoever things the Holy Spirit
   spoke by the prophets are implied each to have belonged to all, and all
   to each.

   Jerome: By Malachi, therefore, the voice of the Holy Spirit resounds to
   the Father concerning the Son, who is the countenance of the Father by
   which He has been known.

   Bede: But John is called an angel not by community of nature, according
   to the heresy of Origen [ed. note: Origen taught that all rational
   beings, angels, devils, and men, were of one nature, differing only in
   rank and condition, according to their deserts (in Joan, tom. ii, 17)
   and capable of change: that men had once been angels: that angels took
   human nature to serve man, and that St. John Baptist was an angel,
   quoting this text. (in Joan, ii, 25.) v Huet, Orig. II, qu. 5, No. 14,
   24, 25], but by the dignity of his office; for angel in Greek is in
   Latin, nuntius (note: messenger), by which name that man is rightly
   called, who was sent by God, that he might bear witness of the light,
   and announce to the world the Lord, coming in the flesh; since it is
   evident that all who are priests may be their office of preaching the
   Gospel be called angels, as the prophet Malachi says, "The lips of the
   priest keep knowledge, and they seek the law at his mouth, because he
   is the Angel of the Lord of hosts." [Mal 2:7]

   Theophylact: The Forerunner of Christ, therefore, is call an angel, on
   account of his angelic life and lofty reverence. Again, where he says,
   "Before thy face," it is as if he said, Thy messenger is near thee:
   whence is shewn the intimate connection of the Forerunner with Christ;
   for those walk next to kings who are their greatest friends.

   There follows, "Who will prepare thy way before thee."

   For by baptism he prepared the minds of the Jews to receive Christ.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or, "the way of the Lord," by which He comes into men,
   in penitence, by which God comes down to us, and we mount up to Him.
   And for this reason the beginning of John's preaching was, "Repent ye."

   Bede: But as John might be called an angel, because he went before the
   face of the Lord by his preaching, so he might also be rightly called a
   voice, because, by his sound, he preceded the Word of the Lord.

   Wherefore there follows, "The voice of one crying, &c."

   For it is an acknowledged thing that the Only-Begotten Son is called
   the Word of the Father, and even we, from having uttered words
   ourselves, know that the voice sounds first, in order that the word may
   afterwards by heard.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But it is called "the voice of one crying," for we are
   wont to use a cry to deaf persons, and to those afar off, or when we
   are indignant, all which things we know applied to the Jews; for
   "salvation is far from the wicked," and they "stopped their ears like
   deaf adders," and deserved to hear "indignation, and wrath, and
   tribulation" from Christ.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But the prophecy, by saying,
   "In the wilderness," plainly shews that the divine teaching was not in
   Jerusalem, but in the wilderness, which was fulfilled to the letter by
   John the Baptist in the wilderness of Jordan, preaching the healthful
   appearing of the Word of God.

   The word of prophecy also shews, that besides the wilderness, which was
   pointed out by Moses, where he made paths, there was another
   wilderness, in which it proclaimed that the salvation of Christ was
   present.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else the voice and the cry is in the desert, because
   they were deserted by the Spirit of God, as a house empty, and swept
   out; deserted also by prophet, priest, and king.

   Bede: What he cried is revealed, in that which is subjoined, "Prepare
   ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight." For whosoever
   preaches a right faith and good works, what else does he but prepare
   the way for the Lord's coming to the hearts of His hearers, that the
   power of grace might penetrate these hearts, and the light of truth
   shine in them? And the paths he makes straight, when he forms pure
   thoughts in the soul by the word of preaching.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord," that is, act
   out repentance and preach it; "make his paths straight," that walking
   in the royal road, we may love our neighbours as ourselves, and
   ourselves as our neighbours. For he who loves himself, and loves not
   his neighbour, turns aside to the right; for many act well, and do not
   correct their neighbour well, as Eli.

   He, on the other hand, who, hating himself, loves his neighbour, turns
   aside to the left; for many, for instance, rebuke well, but act not
   well themselves, as did the Scribes and Pharisees.

   "Paths" are mentioned after the "way" because moral commands are laid
   open after penitence.

   Theophylact: Or, the "way" is the New Testament, and the "paths" are
   the Old, because it is a trodden path. For it was necessary to be
   prepared for the way, that is, for the New Testament; but it was right
   that the paths of the Old Testament should be straightened.

   4. John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
   repentance for the remission of sins.

   5. And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of
   Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan,
   confessing their sins.

   6. And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin
   about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;

   7. And preached, saying, "There cometh one mightier than I after me,
   the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.

   8. I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with
   the Holy Ghost."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: According to the above-mentioned prophecy of Isaiah, the
   way of the Lord is prepared by John, through faith, baptism, and
   penitence; the paths are made straight by the rough marks of the
   hair-cloth garment, the girdle of skin, the feeding on locusts and wild
   honey, and the most lowly voice; whence it is said, "John was in the
   wilderness."

   For John and Jesus seek what is lost in the wilderness; where the devil
   conquered, there he is conquered; where man fell, there he rises up.

   But the name, John, means the grace of God, and the narrative begins
   with grace. For it goes on to say, "baptizing." For by baptism grace is
   given, seeing that by baptism sins are freely remitted.

   But what is brought to perfection by the bridegroom is introduced by
   the friend of the bridegroom. Thus catechumens, (which word means
   persons instructed,) begin by the ministry of the priest, receive the
   chrism from the bishop [ed. note: "Chrismantur." Chrism in the Roman
   Church, was applied twice; at Baptism, and more solemnly to the
   forehead by the Bishop at Confirmation. In the Eastern Church, it was
   only given once, at Confirmation, and by the Bishop only. In the French
   Church, it was given once, usually at Baptism, by the Priest, but if
   for any reason omitted, by the Bishop at Confirmation, see Bingham,
   Antiq. b., xii, e. 2, 2].

   And to shew this, it is subjoined, "And preaching the baptism of
   repentance, &c."

   Bede: It is evident that John not only preached, but also gave to some
   the baptism of repentance; but he could not give baptism for the
   remission of sins [ed. note: vol 1, p. 97, note A]. For the remission
   of sins is only given to us by the baptism of Christ. It is therefore
   only said, "Preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of
   sins;" for he "preached" a baptism which could remit sins, since he
   could not give it.

   Wherefore as he was the forerunner of the Incarnate Word of the Father,
   by the word of his preaching, so by his baptism, which could not remit
   sins, he preceded that baptism, of penitence, by which sins are
   remitted.

   Theophylact: The baptism of John had not remission of sins, but only
   brought men to penitence. He preached therefore the baptism of
   repentance, that is, he preached that to which the baptism of penitence
   led, namely, remission of sins, that they who in penitence received
   Christ, might receive Him to the remission of their sins.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Now by John as by the bridegroom's friend, the bride is
   brought to Christ, as by a servant Rebecca was brought to Isaac [Gen
   24:61]; wherefore there follows, "And there went out to him all, &c.
   For "confession and beauty are in his presence," [Ps 96:6] that is, the
   presence of the bridegroom. And the bride leaping down from her camel
   signifies the Church, who humbles herself on seeing her husband Isaac,
   that is, Christ. But the interpretation of Jordan, where sins are
   washed away, in an alien descent.' For we heretofore aliens to God by
   pride, are by the sign of Baptism made lowly, and thus exalted on high
   [ed. note: see St. Cyril of Jerus., Cat. xx, 4-7].

   Bede: An example of confessing their sins and of promising to lead a
   new life, is held out to those who desire to be baptized, by those
   words which follow, "confessing their sins."

   Chrys." Because indeed John preached repentance, he wore the marks of
   repentance in his garment and in his food.

   Wherefore there follow, "And John was clothed in camel's hair."

   Bede: It says, clothed in a garment of hair, not in woollen clothes;
   the former is the mark of an austere garb, the latter of effeminate
   luxury. But the girdle of skins, with which he was girt, like Elias, is
   a mark of mortification. And this meat, "locusts and wild honey," is
   suited to a dweller in the wilderness, so that his object in eating was
   not the deliciousness of meats, but the satisfying of the necessity of
   human flesh.

   Pseudo-Jerome: The dress of John, his food, and employment, signifies
   the austere life of preachers, and that future nations are to be joined
   to the grace of God, which is John, both in their minds and in
   externals. For by camel's hair, is meant the rich among the nations;
   and by the girdle of skin, the poor, dead to the world; and by the
   wandering locusts, the wise men of this world; who, leaving the dry
   stalks to the Jews, draw off with their legs the mystic grain, and in
   the warmth of their faith leap up towards heaven; and the faithful,
   being inspired by the wild honey, are full-fed from the untilled wood.

   Theophylact: Or else; The garment of "camel's hair" was significative
   of grief, for John pointed out, that he who repented should mourn. For
   sackcloth signifies grief; but the girdle of skins shews the dead state
   of the Jewish people. The food also of John not only denotes
   abstinence, but also shews forth the intellectual food, which the
   people then were eating, without understanding any thing lofty, but
   continually raising themselves on high, and again sinking to the earth.

   For such is the nature of locusts, leaping on high and again falling.
   In the same way the people ate honey, which had come from bees, that
   is, from the prophets; it was not however domestic, but wild, for the
   Jews had the Scriptures, which are as honey, but did not rightly
   understand them.

   Gregory, Moral., xxxi, 25: Or, by the kind itself of his food he
   pointed out the Lord, of whom he was the forerunner; for in that our
   Lord took to Himself the sweetness of the barren Gentiles, he ate wild
   honey. In that He in His own person partly converted the Jews, He
   received locusts for His food, which suddenly leaping up, at once fall
   to the ground. For the Jews leaped up when they promised to fulfil the
   precepts of the Lord; but they fell to the ground when, by their evil
   works, they affirmed that they had not heard them. They made therefore
   a leap upwards in words, and fell down by their actions.

   Bede: The dress and food of John may also express of what kind was his
   inward walk. For he used a dress more austere than was usual, because
   he did not encourage the life of sinners by flattery, but chid them by
   the vigour of his rough rebuke; he had a girdle of skin round his
   loins, for he was one, "who crucified his flesh with the affections and
   lusts." [Gal 5:24] He used to eat locusts and wild honey, because his
   preaching had some sweetness for the multitude, whilst the people
   debated whether he was the Christ himself or not; but this soon came to
   an end, when his hearers understood that he was not the Christ, but the
   forerunner and prophet of Christ. For in honey there is sweetness, in
   locusts swiftness of flight.

   Whence there follows, "And he preached, saying, there cometh one
   mightier than I after me."

   Gloss.: He said this to do away with the opinion of the crowd, who
   thought that he was the Christ; but he announces that Christ is
   "mightier than he," he was to remit sins, which he himself could not
   do.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Who again is mightier than the grace, by which sins are
   washed away, which John signifies? He who seven times and seventy times
   seven remits sins [Matt 18:22]. Grace indeed comes first, but remits
   sins once only by baptism, but mercy reaches to the wretched from Adam
   up to Christ through seventy-seven generations, and up to one hundred
   and forty-four thousand.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But lest he should be
   thought to say this by way of comparing himself to Christ, he subjoins,
   "Of whom I am not worthy, &c."

   It is not however the same thing to loose the shoe-latchet, which Mark
   here says, and to carry his shoes, which Matthew says. And indeed the
   Evangelists following the order of the narrative, and not able to err
   in any thing, say that John spoke each of these sayings in a different
   sense. But commentators on this passage have expounded each in a
   different way.

   For he means by the latchet, the tie of the shoe. He says this
   therefore to extol the excellence of the power of Christ, and the
   greatness of His divinity; as if he said, Not even in the station of
   his servant am I worthy to be reckoned.

   For it is a great thing to contemplate, as it were stooping down, those
   things which belong to the body of Christ, and to see from below the
   image of things above, and to untie each of those mysteries, about the
   Incarnation of Christ, which cannot be unravelled.

   Pseudo-Jerome: The shoe is in the extremity of the body; for in the end
   the Incarnate Saviour is coming for justice, whence it is said by the
   prophet, "Over Edom will I cast out my shoe." [Ps 60:9]

   Gregory: Shoes also are made from the skins of dead animals. The Lord,
   therefore, coming incarnate, appeared as it were with shoes on His
   feet, for He assumed in His divinity the dead skins of our corruption.
   Or else; it was a custom among the ancients, that if a man refused to
   take as his wife the woman whom he ought to take, he who offered
   himself as her husband by right of kindred took off that man's shoe.

   Rightly then does he proclaim himself unworthy to loose his
   shoe-latchet, as if he said openly, I cannot make bare the feet of the
   Redeemer, for I usurp not the name of the Bridegroom, a thing which is
   above my deserts.

   Theophylact: Some persons also understand it thus; all who came to
   John, and were baptized, through penitence were loosed from the bands
   of their sins by believing in Christ. John then in this way loosed the
   shoe-latchet of all the others, that is, the bands of sin. But Christ's
   shoe-latchet he was not able to unloose, because he found no sin in
   Him.

   Bede: Thus then John proclaims the Lord not yet as God, or the Son of
   God, but only as a man mightier than himself. For his ignorant hearers
   were not yet capable of receiving the hidden things of so great a
   Sacrament, that the eternal Son of God, having taken upon Him the
   nature of man, had been lately born into the world of a virgin; but
   gradually by the acknowledgment of His glorified lowliness, they were
   to be introduced to the belief of His Divine Eternity. To these words,
   however, he subjoins, as if covertly declaring that he was the true
   God, "I baptize you with water, but he shall baptize you with the Holy
   Ghost." For who can doubt that none other but God can give the grace of
   the Holy Ghost.

   Jerome: For what is the difference between water and the Holy Ghost,
   who was borne over the face of the waters? Water is the ministry of
   man; but the Spirit is ministered by God.

   Bede: Now we are baptized by the Lord in the Holy Ghost, not only when
   in the day of our baptism, we are washed in the fount of life, to the
   remission of our sins, but also daily by the grace of the same Spirit
   we are inflamed, to do those things which please God.

   9. And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of
   Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

   10. And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
   opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

   11. And there came a voice from heaven, saying, "Thou art My beloved
   Son, in whom I am well pleased."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mark the Evangelist, like a hart, longing after the
   fountains of water, leaps forward over places, smooth and steep; and,
   as a bee laden with honey, he sips the tops of the flowers.

   Wherefore he hath shewn us in his narrative Jesus coming from Nazareth,
   saying, "And it came to pass in those days, &c."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Forasmuch as He was
   ordaining a new baptism, He came to the baptism of John, which, in
   respect of His own baptism, was incomplete, but different from the
   Jewish baptism, as being between both. He did this that He might shew,
   by the nature of His baptism, that He was not baptized for the
   remission of sins, nor as wanting the reception of the Holy Ghost: for
   the baptism of John was destitute of both these.

   But He was baptized that He might be made known to all, that they might
   believe on Him and "fulfil all righteousness," which is "keeping of the
   commandments:" for it has been commanded to men that they should submit
   to the Prophet's baptism.

   Bede, in Marc., i, 4: He was baptized, that by being baptized Himself
   He might shew His approval of John's baptism [ed. note: vol i, pl 109,
   note h], and that, by sanctifying the waters of Jordan through the
   descent of the dove, He might shew the coming of the Holy Ghost in the
   laver of believers.

   Whence there follows, "And straightway coming up out of the water, he
   saw the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit like a dove descending, and
   resting upon him."

   But the heavens are opened, not by the unclosing of the elements, but
   to the eyes of the spirit, to which Ezekiel in the beginning of his
   book relates that they were opened; or that His seeing the heavens
   opened after baptism was done for our sakes, to whom the door of the
   kingdom of heaven is opened by the laver of regeneration.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else, that from heaven
   sanctification might be given to men, and earthly things be joined to
   heavenly. But the Holy Spirit is said to have descended upon Him, not
   as if He then first came to Him, for He never had left Him; but that He
   might shew forth the Christ, Who was preached by John, and point Him
   out to all, as it were by the finger of faith.

   Bede: This event also, in which the Holy Ghost was seen to come down
   upon baptism, was a sign of spiritual grace to be given to us in
   baptism.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But this is the anointing of Christ according to the
   flesh, namely, the Holy Ghost, of which anointing it is said, "God,
   even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
   fellows." [Ps 45:7]

   Bede: Well indeed in the shape of a dove did the Holy Ghost come down,
   for it is an animal of great simplicity, and far removed from the
   malice of gall, that in a figure He might shew us that He looks out for
   simple hearts, and deigns not to dwell in the minds of the wicked.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Again, the Holy Ghost came down in the shape of a dove,
   because in the Canticles it is sung of the Church: "My bride, my love,
   my beloved, my dove."

   "Bride" in the Patriarchs, "love" in the Prophets, "near of kin" in
   Joseph and Mary, "beloved" in John the Baptist, "dove" in Christ and
   His Apostles: to whom it is said, "Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless
   as doves." [Matt. 10:16]

   Bede: Now the Dove sat on the head of Jesus, lest any one should think
   that the voice of the Father was addressed to John and not to Christ.
   And well did he add, "abiding on Him;" for this is peculiar to Christ,
   that the Holy Ghost once filling Him should never leave Him.

   For sometimes to His faithful disciples the grace of the Spirit is
   conferred for signs of virtue, and for the working of miracles,
   sometimes it is taken away; though for the working of piety and
   righteousness, for the preservation of love to God and to one's
   neighbour, the grace of the Spirit is never absent.

   But the voice of the Father shewed that He Himself, who came to John to
   be baptized with the other, was the very Son of God, willing to baptize
   with the Holy Spirit, whence there follows, "And there came a voice
   from heaven, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased." Not
   that this informed the Son Himself of a thing of which He was ignorant,
   but it shews to us what we ought to believe.

   Augustine, de Con. Ev., ii, 14: Wherefore Matthew relates that the
   voice said, "This is my beloved Son;" for he wished to shew that the
   words, "This is My Son," were in fact said, that thus the persons who
   heard it might know that He, and not another, was the Son of God.

   But if you ask which of these two sounded forth in that voice, take
   which you will, only remember, that the Evangelists, though not
   relating the same form of speaking, relate the same meaning. And that
   God delighted Himself in His Son, we are reminded in these words, "In
   thee I am well pleased."

   Bede: The same voice has taught us, that we also, by the water of
   cleansing, and by the Spirit of sanctification, may be made the sons of
   God. The mystery of the Trinity also is shewn forth in the baptism; the
   Son is baptized, the Spirit comes down in the shape of a dove, the
   voice of the Father bearing witness to the Son is heard.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Morally also it may be interpreted; we also, drawn aside
   from the fleeting world by the smell and purity of flowers, run with
   the young maidens after the bridegroom, and are washed in the sacrament
   of baptism, from the two fountains of the love of God, and of our
   neighbour, by the grace of remission, and mounting up by hope gaze upon
   heavenly mysteries with the eyes of a clean heart.

   Then we receive in a contrite and lowly spirit, with simplicity of
   heart, the Holy Spirit, who comes down to the meek, and abides in us,
   by the never-failing charity. And the voice of the Lord from heaven is
   directed to us the beloved of God; "Blessed are the peacemakers, for
   they shall be called the sons of God;" [Matt. 5:9] and then the Father,
   with the Son and the Holy Spirit, is well-pleased with us, when we are
   made one spirit with God.

   12. And immediately the spirit driveth Him into the wilderness.

   13. And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;
   and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., xiii: Because all that Christ did and suffered
   was for our teaching, He began after His baptism to dwell in the
   wilderness, and fought against the devil, that every baptized person
   might patiently sustain greater temptations after His baptism, nor be
   troubled, as if this which happened to Him was contrary to His
   expectation, but might bear up against all things, and come off
   conqueror.

   For although God allows that we should be tempted for many other
   reasons, yet for this cause also He allows it, that we may know, that
   man when tempted is placed in a station of greater honour. For the
   Devil approaches not save where he has beheld one set in a place of
   greater honour; and therefore it is said, "And immediately the Spirit
   drove Him into the wilderness."

   And the reason why He does not simply say that He went into the
   wilderness, but was driven, is that thou mayest understand that it was
   done according to the word of Divine Providence. By which also He shews
   that no man should thrust himself into temptation, but that those who
   from some other state are as it were driven into temptation, remain
   conquerors.

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 5: And that no one might doubt, by what spirit he
   said that Christ was driven into the wilderness, Luke has on purpose
   premised, that "Jesus being full of the Spirit returned from Jordan, "
   and then has added, "and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness;"
   lest the evil spirit should be thought to have any power over Him, who,
   being full of the Holy Spirit, departed whither He was willing to go,
   and did what He was willing to do.

   Chrys., in Matt., Hom., xiii: But the Spirit drove Him into the
   wilderness, because He designed to provoke the devil to tempt Him, and
   thus gave Him an opportunity not only by hunger, but also by the place.
   For then most of all does the devil thrust himself in, when he sees men
   remaining solitary.

   Bede: But He retires into the desert that He may teach us that, leaving
   the allurements of the world, and the company of the wicked, we should
   in all things obey the Divine commands.

   He is left alone and tempted by the devil, that He might teach us,
   "that all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
   persecution;" [2 Tim 3:12] whence it follows, "And He was in the
   wilderness forty days and forty nights, and was tempted of Satan."

   But He was tempted forty days and forty nights that He might shew us
   that as long as we live here and serve God, whether prosperity smile
   upon us, which is meant by the day, or adversity smite us, which agrees
   with the figure of night, at all times our adversary is at hand, who
   ceases not to trouble our way by temptations.

   For "the forty days and forty nights" imply the whole time of this
   world, for the globe in which we are serving God is divided into four
   quarters.

   Again, there are Ten Commandments, by observing which we fight against
   our enemy, but four times ten are forty.

   There follows, "and He was with the wild beasts."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But He says this to shew of
   what nature was the wilderness, for it was impassable by man and full
   of wild beasts.

   It goes on; "and angels ministered unto Him." For after temptation, and
   a victory against the devil, He worked the salvation of man. And thus
   the Apostle says, "Angels are sent to minister for them who shall be
   heirs of salvation." [Heb 1:14]

   We must also observe, that to those who conquer in temptation angels
   stand near and minister.

   Bede: Consider also that Christ dwells among the wild beasts as man,
   but, as God, uses the ministry of Angels. Thus, when in the solitude of
   a holy life we bear with unpolluted mind the bestial manners of men, we
   merit to have the ministry of Angels, by whom, when freed from the
   body, we shall be transferred to everlasting happiness.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or then the beasts dwell with us in peace, as in the ark
   clean animals with the unclean, when the flesh lusts not against the
   spirit. After this, ministering Angels are sent to us, that they may
   give answers and comforts to hearts that watch.

   14. Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
   preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God,

   15. And saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at
   hand: repent ye, and believe the Gospel."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: The Evangelist Mark follows
   Matthew in his order, and therefore after having said that Angels
   minister, he subjoins, "But after that John was put into prison, Jesus
   came, &c."

   After the temptation and the ministry of Angels, He goes back into
   Galilee, teaching us not to resist the violence of evil men.

   Theophylact: And to shew us that in persecutions we ought to retire,
   and not to await them; but when we fall into them, we must sustain
   them.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He retired also that He
   might keep Himself for teaching and for healing, before He suffered,
   and after fulfilling all these things, might become obedient unto
   death.

   Bede: John being put in prison, fitly does the Lord begin to preach:
   wherefore there follows, "Preaching the Gospel, &c." For when the Law
   ceases, the Gospel arises in its steps.

   Pseudo-Jerome: When the shadow ceases, the truth comes on; first, John
   in prison, the Law in Judaea; then, Jesus in Galilee, Paul among the
   Gentiles preaching the Gospel of the kingdom. For to an earthly kingdom
   succeeds poverty, to the poverty of Christians is given an everlasting
   kingdom; but earthly honour is like the foam of water, or smoke, or
   sleep.

   Bede: Let no one, however, suppose that the putting of John in prison
   took place immediately after the forty days' temptation and the fast of
   the Lord; for whosoever reads the Gospel of John will find, that the
   Lord taught many things before the putting of John in prison, and also
   did many miracles; for you have in his Gospel, "This beginning of
   miracles did Jesus;" [John 2:11] and afterwards, "for John was not yet
   cast into prison." [John 3:24]

   Now it is said that when John read the books of Matthew, Mark, and
   Luke, he approved indeed the text of the history, and affirmed that
   they had spoken truth, but said that they had composed the history of
   only one year after John was cast into prison, in which year also he
   suffered. Passing over then the year of which the transactions had been
   published by the three others, he related the events of the former
   period, before John was cast into prison.

   When therefore Mark had said that "Jesus came into Galilee, preaching
   the Gospel of the kingdom," he subjoins, "saying, Since the time is
   fulfilled, &c."

   Pseudo-Chrys., vict. Ant. Cat. in Marc.: Since then the time was
   fulfilled, "when the fulness of times was come, and God sent His son,"
   it was fitting that the race of man should obtain the last dispensation
   of God. And therefore he says, "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

   Origen, in Matt., tom. x, 14: But the kingdom of God is essentially the
   same as the kingdom of heaven, though they differ in idea. [ed. note:
   see Origen, de Orat. 25, 26 in Matt. t 12.14 (?)]

   For by the kingdom of God is to be understood that in which God reigns;
   and this in truth is in the region of the living, where, seeing God
   face to face, they will abide in the good things now promised to them;
   whether by this region one chooses to understand Love, or some other
   confirmation [ed. note: By confirmation,' seems to be meant the
   perfecting of spiritual natures; see Thomas Aq., Summa Theologica, part
   1, Q62, Art 1. It answers to (greek word) as used by St. Basil; de Sp.
   S 16] of those who put on the likeness of things above, which are
   signified by the heavens. [ed. note: "Coeli" is commonly interpreted of
   the Angels, by the Fathers.]

   For it is clear [ed. note: see Chrys., in Matt., Hom. 19 in c. 6,9]
   enough that the kingdom of God is confined neither by place nor by
   time.

   Theophylact: Or else, the Lord means that the time of the Law is
   complete; as if He said, Up to this time the Law was at work; from this
   time the kingdom of God will work, that is, a conversation according to
   the Gospel, which is with reason likened to the kingdom of heaven. For
   when you see a man clothed in flesh living according to the Gospel, do
   you not say that he has the kingdom of heaven, which "is not meat and
   drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost?" [Rom
   14:17]

   The next word is, "Repent."

   Pseudo-Jerome: For he must repent, who would keep close to eternal
   good, that is, to the kingdom of God. For he who would have the kernel,
   breaks the shell; the sweetness of the apple makes up for the
   bitterness of its root; the hope of gain makes the dangers of the sea
   pleasant; the hope of health takes away from the painfulness of
   medicine.

   They are able worthily to proclaim the preaching of Christ who have
   deserved to attain to the reward of forgiveness; and therefore after He
   has said, "Repent," He subjoins, "and believe the Gospel." For unless
   ye have believed, ye shall not understand.

   Bede: "Repent," therefore, "and believe;" that is, renounce dead works;
   for of what use is believing without good works? The merit of good
   works does not, however, bring to faith, but faith begins, that good
   works may follow.

   16. Now as He walked by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon, and Andrew
   his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.

   17. And Jesus said unto them, "Come ye after Me, and I will make you to
   become fishers of men."

   18. And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed Him.

   19. And when He had gone a little farther thence, He saw James, the son
   of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who also were in the ship mending
   their nets.

   20. And straightway He called them: and they left their father Zebedee
   in the ship with the hired servants, and went after Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: The Evangelist, having mentioned the preaching of Christ to the
   multitude, goes on to the calling of the disciples, whom He made
   ministers of His preaching, whence it follows, "And passing along the
   sea of Galilee, &c."

   Theophylact: As the Evangelist John relates, Peter and Andrew were
   disciples of the Forerunner, but seeing that John had borne witness to
   Jesus, they joined themselves to him; afterwards, grieving that John
   had been cast into prison, they returned to their trade.

   Wherefore there follows, "casting nets into the sea, for they were
   fishers."

   Look then upon them, living on their own labours, not on the fruits of
   iniquity; for such men were worthy to become the first disciples of
   Christ; whence it is subjoined, "And Jesus said unto them, Come ye
   after Me."

   Now He calls them for the second time; for this is the second calling
   in respect of that, of which we read in John. But it is shewn to what
   they were called, when it is added, "I will make you become fishers of
   men."

   Remig.: For by the net of holy preaching they drew fish, that is, men,
   from the depths of the sea, that is, of infidelity, to the light of
   faith. Wonderful indeed is this fishing! for fishes when they are
   caught, soon after die; when men are caught by the word of preaching,
   they rather are made alive.

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 6: Now fishers and unlettered men are sent to
   preach, that the faith of believers might be thought to lie in the
   power of God, not in eloquence or in learning. It goes on to say, "and
   immediately they left their nets, and followed Him."

   Theophylact: For we must not allow any time to lapse, but at once
   follow the Lord. After these again, He catches James and John, because
   they also, though poor, supported the old age of their father.

   Wherefore there follows, "And when He had gone a little farther thence,
   He saw James, the son of Zebedee, &c."

   But they left their father, because he would have hindered them in
   following Christ. Do thou, also, when thou art hindered by thy parents,
   leave them, and come to God. It is shewn by this that Zebedee was not a
   believer; but the mother of the Apostles believed, for she followed
   Christ, when Zebedee was dead.

   Bede: It may be asked, how he could call two fishers from each of the
   boats, (first, Peter and Andrew, then having gone a little further, the
   two others, sons of Zebedee,) when Luke says that James and John were
   called to help Peter and Andrew, and that it was to Peter only that
   Christ said, "Fear not, from this time thou shalt catch men;" [Luke
   5:!0] he also says, that "at the same time, when they had brought their
   ships to land, they followed Him."

   We must therefore understand that the transaction which Luke intimates
   happened first, and afterwards that they, as their custom was, had
   returned to their fishing. So that what Mark here relates happened
   afterwards; for in this case they followed the Lord, without drawing
   their boats ashore, (which they would have done had they meant to
   return,) and followed Him, as one calling them, and ordering them to
   follow.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Further, we are mystically carried away to heaven, like
   Elias, by this chariot, drawn by these fishers, as by four horses. On
   these four corner-stones the first Church is built; in these, as in the
   four Hebrew letters, we acknowledge the tetragrammation, the name of
   the Lord, we who are commanded, after their example, to "hear" the
   voice of the Lord, and "to forget" the "people" of wickedness, and "the
   house of our fathers' " [Ps 45:10] conversation, which is folly before
   God, and the spider's net, in the meshes of which we, like gnats, were
   all but fallen, and were confined by things vain as the air, which
   hangs on nothing; loathing also the ship of our former walk.

   For Adam, our forefather according to the flesh, is clothed with the
   skins of dead beasts; but now, having put off the old man, with his
   deeds, following the new man we are clothed with those skins of
   Solomon, with which the bride rejoices that she has been made beautiful
   [Song of Songs, 1:4].

   Again, Simon, means obedient; Andrew, manly; James, supplanter [ed.
   note: Cf. vol i, 139, 140, 364]; John, grace; by which four names, we
   are knit together into God's host [ed. note: Al. in imaginem'] ; by
   obedience, that we may listen; by manliness, that we do battle; by
   overthrowing, that we may persevere; by grace, that we may be
   preserved. Which four virtues are called cardinal; for by prudence, we
   obey; by justice, we bear ourselves manfully; by temperance, we tread
   the serpent underfoot; by fortitude, we earn the grace of God.

   Theophylact: We must know also, that action is first called, then
   contemplation; for Peter is the type of the active life, for he was
   more ardent than the others, just as the active life is the more
   bustling; but John is the type of the contemplative life, for he speaks
   more fully of divine things.

   21. And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day He
   entered into the synagogue, and taught.

   22. And they were astonished as His doctrine: for He taught them as one
   that had authority, and not as the Scribes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mark, arranging the sayings of the Gospel as they were
   in his own mind, not in themselves, quits the order of the history, and
   follows the order of the mysteries.

   Wherefore he relates the first miracle on the sabbath day, saying, "And
   they go into Capernaum."

   Theophylact: Quitting Nazareth. Now on the sabbath day, when the
   Scribes were gathered together, He entered into a synagogue, and
   taught.

   Wherefore there follows, "And straightway on the sabbath day, having
   entered into the synagogue, He taught them."

   For this end the Law commanded them to give themselves up to rest on
   the sabbath day, that they might meet together to attend to sacred
   reading. Again, Christ taught them by rebuke, not by flattery as did
   the Pharisees; wherefore it says, "And they were astonished at His
   doctrine; for He taught them as one having power, and not as the
   Scribes."

   He taught them also in power, transforming men to good, and He
   threatened punishment to those who did not believe on Him.

   Bede: The Scribes themselves taught the people what was written in
   Moses and the Prophets; but Jesus as the God and Lord of Moses,
   himself, by the freedom of His own will, either added those things
   which appeared wanting in the Law, or altered things as He preached to
   the people; as we read in Matthew, "It was said to them of old time,
   but I say unto you." [Matt. 5:27]
     __________________________________________________________________

   23. And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and
   he cried out,

   24. Saying, "Let us alone; what have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of
   Nazareth? art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art, the
   Holy One of God."

   25. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Hold thy peace, and come out of
   him."

   26. And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud
   voice, he came out of him.

   27. And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
   themselves, saying, "What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for
   with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey
   him."

   28. And immediately His fame spread abroad throughout all the region
   round about Galilee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 7: Since by the envy of the devil death first
   entered into the world, it was right that the medicine of healing
   should first work against the author of death; and therefore it is
   said, "And there was in their synagogue a man, &c."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: The word, Spirit, is applied
   to an Angel, the air, the soul, and even the Holy Ghost. Lest therefore
   by the sameness of the name we should fall into error, he adds,
   "unclean." And he is called unclean on account of his impiousness and
   far removal from God, and because he employs himself in all unclean and
   wicked works.

   Augustine, City of God, 21: Moreover, how great is the power which the
   lowliness of God, appearing in the form of a servant, has over the
   pride of devils, the devils themselves know so well, that they express
   it to the same Lord clothed in the weakness of flesh. For there
   follows, "And he cried out, saying, What have we to do we Thee, Jesus
   of Nazareth, &c."

   For it is evident in these words that there was in them knowledge, but
   there was not charity; and the reason was, that they feared their
   punishment from Him, and loved not the righteousness in Him.

   Bede: For the devils, seeing the Lord on the earth, thought that they
   were immediately to be judged.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else the devil so speaks,
   as if he said, by taking away uncleanness, and giving to the souls of
   men divine knowledge, Thou allowest us no place in men.'

   Theophylact: For to come out of man the devil considers as his own
   perdition; for devils are ruthless, thinking that they suffer some
   evil, so long as they are not troubling men.

   There follows, "I know that Thou art the Holy One of God."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: As if he said, Methinks that
   Thou art come; for he had not a firm and certain knowledge of the
   coming of God. But he calls Him "holy" not as one of many, for every
   prophet was also holy, but he proclaims that the was the One holy; by
   the article in Greek he shews Him to be the One, but by his fear he
   shews Him to be Lord of all.

   Augustine: For He was known to them in that degree in which He wished
   to be known; and He wished as much as was fitting. He was not known to
   them as to the holy Angels, who enjoy Him by partaking of His eternity
   according as He is the Word of God; but as He was to be made known in
   terror, to those beings from whose tyrannical power He was about to
   free the predestinate.

   He was known therefore to the devils, not in that He is eternal Life,
   [see 1 John 5:20, John 17:3] but by some temporal effects of His Power,
   which might be more clear to the angelic senses of even bad spirits
   than to the weakness of men.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Further, the Truth did not
   wish to have the witness of unclean spirits.

   Wherefore there follows, "And Jesus threatened him, saying, &c."

   Whence a healthful precept is given to us; let us not believe devils,
   howsoever they may proclaim the truth.

   It goes on, "And the unclean spirit tearing him, &c."

   For because the man spoke as one in his senses and uttered his words
   with discretion, lest it should be thought that he put together his
   words not from the devil but out of his own heart, He permitted the man
   to be torn by the devil, that He might shew that it was the devil who
   spoke.

   Theophylact: That they might know, when they saw it, from how great an
   evil the man was freed, and on account of the miracle might believe.

   Bede: But it may appear to be a discrepancy, that he should have gone
   out of him, tearing him, or, as some copies have it, vexing him, when,
   according to Luke, he did not hurt him. But Luke himself says, "When He
   had cast him into the midst, he came out of him, without hurting him."
   [Luke 4:35] Wherefore it is inferred that Mark meant by vexing or
   tearing him, what Luke expresses , in the words, "When He had cast him
   into the midst;" so that what he goes on to say, "And did not hurt
   him," may be understood to mean that the tossing of his limbs and
   vexing did not weaken him, as devils are wont to come out even with the
   cutting off and tearing away of limbs. But seeing the power of the
   miracle, they wonder at the newness of our Lord's doctrine, and are
   roused to search into what they had heard by what they had seen.

   Wherefore there follows, "And they all wondered, &c."

   For miracles were done that they might more firmly believe the Gospel
   of the kingdom of God, which was being preached, since those who were
   promising heavenly joys to men on earth, were shewing forth heavenly
   things and divine works even on earth. For before (as the Evangelist
   says) "He was teaching them as one who had power," and now, as the
   crowd witnesses, "with power He commands the evil spirits, and they
   obey Him."

   It goes on, "And immediately His fame spread abroad, &c."

   Gloss.: For those things which men wonder at they soon divulge, for
   "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." [Matt. 12:34]

   Pseudo-Jerome: Moreover, Capernaum is mystically interpreted the town
   of consolation, and the sabbath as rest. The man with an evil spirit is
   healed by rest and consolation, that the place and time may agree with
   his healing. This man with an unclean spirit is the human race, in
   which uncleanness reigned from Adam to Moses; [Rom 5:14] for "they
   sinned without law," and "perished without law." [Rom 2:12] and he,
   knowing the Holy One of God, is ordered to hold his peace, for they
   "knowing God did not glorify him as God," [Rom 1:21] but "rather served
   the creature than the Creator." [Rom 1:25]

   The spirit tearing the man came out of him. When salvation is near,
   temptation is at hand also. Pharaoh, when about to let [ed. note: Al.
   dismissus ab Israel'] Israel go, pursues Israel; the devil, when
   despised, rises up to create scandals.

   29. And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
   entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

   30. But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell
   him of her.

   31. And He came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
   immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 7: First, it was right that the serpent's tongue
   should be shut up, that it might not spread any more venom; then that
   the woman, who was first seduced, should be healed from the fever of
   carnal concupiscence.

   Wherefore it is said, "And forthwith, when they were come out of the
   synagogue, &c."

   Theophylact: He retired then as the custom was on the sabbath-day about
   evening to eat in His disciples' house. But she who ought to have
   ministered was prevented by a fever.

   Wherefore it goes on, "But Simon's wife's mother was lying sick of a
   fever."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., 1, 32: But the disciples,
   knowing that they were to receive a benefit by that means, without
   waiting for the evening prayed that Peter's mother should be healed.

   Wherefore there follows, "who immediately tell Him of her."

   Bede: But in the Gospel of Luke it is written that "they besought Him
   for her." [Luke 4:38] For the Saviour sometimes after being asked,
   sometimes of His own accord, heals the sick, shewing that He always
   assents to the prayers of the faithful, when they pray also against bad
   passions, and sometimes gives them to understand things which they do
   not understand at all, or else, when they pray unto Him dutifully,
   forgives their want of understanding; as the Psalmist begs of God,
   "Cleanse me, O Lord, from my secret faults." [Ps 19:12]

   Wherefore He heals her at their request; for there follows, "And He
   came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up."

   Theophylact: By this it is signified, that God will heal a sick man, if
   he ministers to the Saints, through love to Christ.

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 6: But in that He gives most profusely His gifts of
   healing and doctrine on the sabbath day, He teaches, that He is not
   under the Law, but above the Law, and does not choose the Jewish
   sabbath, but the true sabbath, and our rest is pleasing to the Lord,
   if, in order to attend to the health of our souls, we abstain from
   slavish work, that is, from all unlawful things.

   It goes on, "And immediately the fever left her, &c."

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 8: The health which is conferred at the command of
   the Lord, returns at once entire, accompanied with such strength that
   she is able to minister to those of whose help she had before stood in
   need.

   Again, if we suppose that the man delivered from the devil means, in
   the moral way of interpretation, the soul purged from unclean thoughts,
   fitly does the woman cured of a fever by the command of God mean the
   flesh, restrained from the heat of it concupiscence by the precepts of
   continence.

   Pseudo-Jerome: For the fever means intemperance, from which, we the
   sons of the synagogue [ed. note: See St. Augustine on Ps 72, no. 4, 5,
   "Ecclesia Socrus Synagogue." The Church is called the daughter of the
   Synagogue in the spurious Altercatio Eccles. et Synagog.' (Aug. Opp t.
   viii, p. 19.) They word's ynagogue' is applied to the Church by Justin
   M. Dial, see Tryph, p. 160 (Ben.) Clem. Alex. Str. vi, 633.], by the
   hand of discipline, and by the lifting up of our desires, are healed,
   and minister to the will of Him who heals us.

   Theophylact: But he has a fever who is angry, and in the unruliness of
   his anger stretches forth his hands to do hurt; but if reason restrains
   his hands, he will arise, and so serve reason.

   32. And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto Him all that
   were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

   33. And all the city was gathered together at the door.

   34. And He healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out
   many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew
   Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: Because the multitude thought that it was not lawful to
   heal on the sabbath day, they waited for the evening, to bring those
   who were to be healed to Jesus.

   Wherefore it is said, "And at even, when the sun had set."

   There follows, "and He healed many that were vexed with divers
   diseases."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Now in that he says "many",
   all are to be understood according to the Scripture mode of expression.

   Theophylact: Or he says, "many", because there were some faithless
   persons, who could not at all be cured on account of their
   unfaithfulness. Therefore He healed many of those who were brought,
   that is, all who had faith.

   It goes on, "and cast out many devils."

   Pseudo-Augustine, Quaest. e Vet. et Nov. Test. 16: For the devils knew
   that He was the Christ, who had been promised by the Law: for they saw
   in Him all the signs which had been foretold by the Prophets; but they
   were ignorant of His divinity, as also were "their princes, for if they
   had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." [1 Cor
   2:8]

   Bede: For, Him whom the devil had known as a man, wearied by His forty
   days' fast, without being able by tempting Him to prove whether He was
   the Son of God, he now by the power of His miracles understood or
   rather suspected to be the Son of God. The reason therefore why he
   persuaded the Jews to crucify Him, was not because he did not think
   that He was the Son of God, but because he did not foresee that he
   himself was to be condemned by Christ's death.

   Theophylact: Furthermore, the reason that He forbade the devils to
   speak, was to teach us not to believe them, even if they say true. For
   if once they find persons to believe them, they mingle truth with
   falsehood.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: And Luke does not contradict
   this, when he says, that "devils came out of many, crying out and
   saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God:" [Luke 4:41] for he subjoins,
   "And He rebuking them, suffered them not to speak;" for Mark, who
   passes over many things for the sake of brevity, speaks about what
   happened subsequently to the abovementioned words.

   Bede: Again, in a mystical sense, the setting of the sun signifies the
   passion of Him, who said, "As long as I am in the world, I am the light
   of the world." [John 9:5] And when the sun was going down, more
   demoniacs and sick persons were healed than before: because He who
   living in the flesh for a time taught a few Jews, has transmitted the
   gifts of faith and health to all the Gentiles throughout the world.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But the door of the kingdom, morally, is repentance and
   faith, which works health for various diseases; for divers are the
   vices with which the city of this world is sick.
     __________________________________________________________________

   35. And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, He went
   out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.

   36. And Simon and they that were with Him followed after Him.

   37. And when they had found Him, they said unto Him, "All men seek for
   Thee."

   38. And He said unto them, "Let us go into the next towns, that I may
   preach there also: for therefore came I forth."

   39. And He preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and
   cast out devils.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After that the Lord had cured the sick, He retired apart.

   Wherefore it is said, "And rising very early in the morning, He went
   out and departed into a desert place." By which He taught us not to do
   any thing for the sake of appearance, but if we do any good, not to
   publish it openly.

   It goes on, "and there prayed."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Not that He required prayer;
   for it was He who Himself received the prayers of men; but He did this
   by way of an economy, and became to us the model of good work.

   Theophylact: For He shews to us that we ought to attribute to God
   whatever we do well, and to say to Him, "Every good gift cometh down
   from above," [James 1:17] from Thee.

   It continues: "And Simon followed Him, and they that were with Him."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Luke however says that
   crowds came to Christ, and spoke what Mark here relates that the
   Apostles said, adding, "And when they came to Him, they said to Him,
   All seek thee." [Luke 4:42] But they do not contradict each other; for
   Christ received after the Apostles the multitude, breathlessly anxious
   to embrace His feet. He received them willingly, but chose to dismiss
   them, that the rest also might be partakers of His doctrine, as He was
   not to remain long in the world.

   And therefore there follows: "And He said, Let us go into the
   neighbouring villages and towns, that there also I may preach."

   Theophylact: For He passes on to them as being more in need, since it
   was not right to shut up doctrine in one place, but to throw out his
   rays every where.

   It goes on: "For therefore am I come."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: In which word, He manifests
   the mystery of His "emptying himself," [see Phil. 2:7-8] that is, of
   His incarnation, and the sovereignty of His divine nature, in that He
   here asserts, that He came willingly into the world.

   Luke however says, "To this end was I sent," proclaiming the
   Dispensation, and the good pleasure of God the Father concerning the
   incarnation of the Son.

   There follows: "And He continued preaching in their synagogues, in all
   Galilee."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 19: But by this preaching, which, he
   says, "He continued in all Galilee," is also meant the sermon of the
   Lord delivered on the mount, which Matthew mentions, and Mark has
   entirely passed over, without giving any thing like it, save that he
   has repeated some sentences not in continuous order, but in scattered
   places, spoken by the Lord at other times.

   Theophylact: He also mingled action with teaching, for whilst employed
   in preaching, He afterwards put to flight devils.

   For there follows: "And casting out devils."

   For unless Christ shewed forth miracles, He teaching would not be
   believed; so do thou also, after teaching, work, that thy word be not
   fruitless in thyself.

   Bede: Again, mystically if by the setting of the sun, the death of the
   Saviour is intended, why should not His resurrection be intended by the
   returning dawn? For by its clear light, He went far into the wilderness
   of the Gentiles, and there continued praying in the person of His
   faithful disciples, for He aroused their hearts by the grace of the
   Holy Spirit to the virtue of prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   40. And there came a leper to Him, beseeching Him, and kneeling down to
   Him, and saying unto Him, "If Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean."

   41. And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth His hand, and touched
   him, and saith unto him, "I will; be thou clean."

   42. And as soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from
   him, and he was cleansed.

   43. And He straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

   44. And saith unto him, "See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy
   way, shew thyself to the Priest, and offer for thy cleansing those
   things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."

   45. But he went out and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad
   the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the
   city, but was without in desert places: and they came to Him from every
   quarter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, in Marc., i, 7: After that the serpent-tongue of the devils was
   shut up, and the woman, who was first seduced, cured of a fever, in the
   third place, the man, who listened to the evil counsels of the woman,
   is cleansed from his leprosy, that the order of restoration in the Lord
   might be the same as was the order of the fall in our first parents.

   Whence it goes on: "And there came a leper to him, beseeching Him."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 19: Mark puts together circumstances,
   from which one may infer that he is the same as that one whom Matthew
   relates to have been cleansed, when the Lord came down from the mount,
   after the sermon. [Matt 8:2]

   Bede, in Marc., i, 9: And because the Lord said that He came "not to
   destroy the Law but to fulfill," [Matt. 5:17] he who was excluded by
   the Law, inferring that he was cleansed by the power of the Lord,
   shewed that grace, which could wash away the stain of the leper, was
   not from the Law, but over the Law. And truly, as in the Lord
   authoritative power, so in him the constancy of faith is shewn.

   For there follows: "Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean."

   He falls on his face, which is at once a gesture of lowliness and of
   shame, to shew that every man should blush for the stains of his life.
   But his shame did not stifle confession; he shewed his wound, and
   begged for medicine, and the confession is full of devotion and of
   faith, for he refers the power to the will of the Lord.

   Theophylact: For he said not, If thou wilt, pray unto God, but, "If
   Thou wilt," as thinking Him very God.

   Bede: Moreover, he doubted of the will of the Lord, not as disbelieving
   His compassion, but, as conscious of his own filth, he did not presume.

   It goes on; "But Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth His hand, and
   touched him, and saith unto him, I will, be thou clean."

   It is not, as many of the Latins think, to be taken to mean and read, I
   wish to cleanse thee, but that Christ should say separately, "I will,"
   and then command , "be thou clean."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 25: Further, the reason why He touches the
   leper, and did not confer health upon him by word alone, was, that it
   is said by Moses in the Law, that he who touches a leper shall be
   unclean till the evening; that is, that he might shew that this
   uncleanness is a natural one, that the Law was not laid down for Him,
   but on account of mere men. Furthermore, He shews that He Himself is
   the Lord of the Law; and the reason why He touched the leper, though
   the touch was not necessary to the working of the cure, was to shew
   that He gives health, not as a servant, but as the Lord.

   Bede: Another reason why He touched him, was to proved that He could
   not be defiled, who free others from pollution. At the same time it is
   remarkable, that He healed in the way in which He had been begged to
   heal.

   "If Thou wilt," says the leper, "Thou canst make me clean."

   "I will," He answered, behold, thou hast My will, "be clean;" now thou
   hast at once the effect of My compassion.

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 25: Moreover, by this, not only did He not take
   away the opinion of Him entertained by the leper, but He confirmed it;
   for He puts to flight the disease by a word, and what the leper had
   said in word, He filled up in deed.

   Wherefore there follows, "And when He had spoken, immediately, &c."

   Bede: For there is no interval between the work of God and the command,
   because the work is in the command, for "He commanded, and they were
   created." [Ps 148:5]

   There follows: "And He straitly charged him, and forthwith, &c." See
   thou tell no man."

   Chrys., Hom 25: As if He said, It is not yet time that My works should
   be preached, I require not thy preaching. By which He teaches us not to
   seek worldly honour as a reward for our works.

   It goes on: "But go thy way, shew thyself to the chief of the priests."

   Our Saviour sent him to the priest for the trial of his cure, and that
   he might not be cast out of the temple, but still be numbered with the
   people in prayer. He sends him also, that he might fulfil all the parts
   of the Law, in order to stop the evil-speaking tongue of the Jews. He
   Himself indeed completed the work, leaving them to try it.

   Bede: This He did in order that the priest might understand that the
   leper was not healed by the Law, but by the grace of God above the Law.

   There follows: "And offer for thy cleansing what Moses, &c."

   Theophylact: He ordered him to offer the gift which they who were
   healed were accustomed to offer, as if for a testimony, that He was not
   against the Law, but rather confirmed the Law, inasmuch as He Himself
   worked out the precepts of the Law.

   Bede: If any one wonders, how the Lord seems to approve of the Jewish
   sacrifice, which the Church rejects, let him remember that He had not
   yet offered His own holocaust in His passion. And it was not right that
   significative sacrifices should be taken away before that which they
   signified was confirmed by the witness of the Apostles in their
   preaching, and by the faith of the believing people.

   Theophylact: But the leper, although the Lord forbade him disclosed the
   benefit, wherefore it goes on: "But he having gone out, began to
   publish and to blaze abroad the tale;" for the person benefitted ought
   to be grateful, and to return thanks, even though his benefactor
   requires it not.

   Bede, see Greg., Moral., 19, 22: Now it may well be asked, why our Lord
   ordered His action to be concealed, and yet it could not be kept hid
   for an hour? But it is to be observed, that the reason why, in doing a
   miracle, He ordered it to be kept secret, and yet for all that it was
   noised abroad, was, that His elect, following the example of His
   teaching, should wish indeed that in the great things which they do,
   they should remain concealed, but should nevertheless unwillingly be
   brought to light for the good of others. Not then that He wished any
   thing to be done, which He was not able to bring about, but, by the
   authority of His teaching, He gave an example of what His members ought
   to wish for, and of what should happen to them even against their will.

   Bede: Further, this perfect cure of one man brought large multitudes to
   the Lord.

   Wherefore it is added, "So that He could not any more openly enter into
   the city, but could only be without in desert places."

   Chrys.: For the leper every where proclaimed his wonderful cure, so
   that all ran to see and to believe on the Healer; thus the Lord could
   not preach the Gospel, but walked in desert places.

   Wherefore there follows, "And they came together to Him from all
   places."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mystically, our leprosy is the sin of the first man,
   which began from the head, when he desired the kingdom of the world.
   For covetousness is the root of all evil; wherefore Gehazi, engaged in
   an avaritious pursuit, is covered with leprosy.

   Bede: But when the hand of the Saviour, that is, the Incarnate Word of
   God, is stretched out, and touches human nature, it is cleansed from
   the various parts of the old error.

   Pseudo-Jerome: This leprosy is cleansed on offering an oblation to the
   true Priest after the order of Melchisedec; for He tells us, "Give alms
   of such things as ye have, and, behold, all things are clean unto you."
   [Luke 11:41]

   But in that Jesus could not openly enter into the city, it is meant to
   be conveyed that Jesus is not manifested to those who are enslaved to
   the love of praise in the broad highway, and to their own wills, but to
   those who with Peter go into the desert, which the Lord chose for
   prayer, and for refreshing His people; that is, those who quit the
   pleasures of the world, and all that they possess, that they may say,
   "The Lord is my portion." But the glory of the Lord is manifested to
   those, who meet together on all sides, that is, through smooth ways and
   steep, whom nothing can "separate from the love of Christ." [Rom 8:35]

   Bede, in Marc., i, 10: Even after working a miracle in that city, the
   Lord retires into the desert, to shew that He loves best a quiet life,
   and one far removed from the cares of the world, and that it is on
   account of this desire, He applied Himself to the healing of the body.

Chapter 2

   1. And again He entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was
   noised that He was in the house.

   2. And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was
   no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and He
   preached the word unto them.

   3. And they came unto Him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was
   carried by four.

   4. And when they could not come nigh unto Him for the press, they
   uncovered the roof where He was: and when they had broken it up, they
   let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

   5. When Jesus saw their faith, He said unto the sick of the palsy,
   "Son, thy sins be forgiven thee."

   6. But there were certain of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning
   in their hearts,

   7. Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but
   God only?

   8. And immediately when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they so
   reasoned within themselves, He said unto them, "Why reason ye these
   things in your hearts?

   9. Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be
   forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?

   10. But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
   forgive sins, (He saith to the sick of the palsy,)

   11. I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into
   thine house."

   12. And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before
   them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God,
   saying, "We never saw it on this fashion."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 10: Because the compassion of God deserts not even
   carnal persons, He accords to them the grace of His presence, by which
   even they may be made spiritual. After the desert, the Lord returns
   into the city.

   Wherefore it is said, "And again He entered into Capernaum, &c."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 25: But Matthew writes this miracle as if
   it were done in the city of the Lord, whilst Mark places it in
   Capernaum, which would be more difficult of solution, if Matthew had
   also named Nazareth. But seeing that Galilee itself might be called the
   city of the Lord, who can doubt but that the Lord did these things in
   His own city, since He did them in Capernaum, a city of Galilee;
   particularly as Capernaum was of such importance in Galilee as to be
   called its metropolis?

   Or else, Matthew passed by the things which were done after He came
   into His own city, until He came to Capernaum, and so adds on the story
   of the paralytic healed, subjoining, "And, behold, they presented to
   Him a man sick of the palsy," after he had said that He came into His
   own city.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else, Matthew called
   Capernaum His city because He went there frequently, and there did many
   miracles.

   It goes on: "And it was noised that He was in the house, &c."

   For the desire of hearing Him was stronger that the toil of approaching
   Him. After this, they introduce the paralytic, of whom Matthew and Luke
   speak; wherefore there follows: "And they came unto Him bearing one
   sick of the palsy, who was carried by four."

   Finding the door blocked up by the crowd, they could not by any means
   enter that way. Those who carried him, however, hoping that he could
   merit the grace of being healed, raising the bed with their burden, and
   uncovering the roof, lay him with his bed before the face of the
   Saviour.

   And this is that which is added: "And when they could not lay him
   before Him, &c."

   There follows: "But when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the sick of
   the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee."

   He did not mean the faith of the sick man, but of his bearers; for it
   sometimes happens that a man is healed by the faith of another.

   Bede: It may indeed be seen how much each person's own faith weighs
   with God, when that of another had such influence that the whole man at
   once rose up, healed body and soul, and by one man's merit, another
   should have his sins forgiven him.

   Theophylact: He saw the faith of the sick man himself, since he would
   not have allowed himself to be carried, unless he'd had faith to be
   healed.

   Bede: Moreover, the Lord being about to cure the man of the palsy,
   first loosed the chains of his sins, in order to shew that he was
   condemned to the loosening of his joints, because of the bonds of his
   sins, and could not be healed to the recovery of his limbs, unless
   these were first loosened.

   But Christ's wonderful humility calls this man, despised, weak, with
   all the joints of his limbs unstrung, a son, when the priests did not
   deign to touch him. Or at least, He therefore calls him a son because
   his sins are forgiven him.

   It goes on: "But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and
   reasoning in their hearts, Why doth this man speak blasphemies?"

   Cyril [ed. note: Nicolai observes on this passage, Nihil tale occurrit
   in Cyrillo, tametsi blasphemiae ideo a Judaeis improperatae Christo
   meminit in Johannem, Lib. ii, e.3.]: Now they accuse Him of blasphemy,
   anticipating the sentence of His death: for there was a command in the
   Law, that whosoever blasphemed should be put to death. And this charge
   they laid upon Him, because He claimed for Himself the divine power of
   remitting sins.

   Wherefore it is added, "Who can forgive sin, save God only?" For the
   Judge of all alone has power to forgive sin.

   Bede: Who remits sin by those also to whom He has assigned the power of
   remitting, and therefore Christ is proved to be very God, for He is
   able to remit sins as God.

   The Jews then are in error, who although they hold the Christ both to
   be God, and to be able to remit sins, do not however believe that Jesus
   is the Christ.

   But the Arians err much more madly, who although overwhelmed with the
   words of the Evangelist, so that they cannot deny that Jesus is the
   Christ, and can remit sin, nevertheless fear not to deny that He is
   God.

   But He Himself, desiring to shame the traitors both by His knowledge of
   things hidden and by the virtue of His works, manifests Himself to be
   God.

   For there follows: "And immediately when Jesus perceived in His spirit
   that they so reasoned, He said unto them, Why reason ye these things in
   your hearts?"

   In which He shews Himself to be God, since He can know the hidden
   things of the heart; and in a manner though silent He speaks thus, With
   the same power and majesty, by which I look upon your thoughts, I can
   forgive the sins of men.

   Theophylact: But though their thoughts were laid bare, still they
   remain insensible, refusing to believe that He who knew their hearts
   could forgive sins, wherefore the Lord proves to them the cure of the
   soul by that of the body, shewing the invisible by the visible, that
   which is more difficult by that which is easier, although they did not
   look upon it as such.

   For the Pharisees thought it more difficult to heal the body, as being
   more open to view; but the soul more easy to cure, because the cure is
   invisible; so that they reasoned thus, Lo, He does not now cure the
   body, but heals the unseen soul; if He'd had more power, He would at
   once have cured the body, and not have fled for refuge to the unseen
   world.

   The Saviour, therefore, shewing that He can do both, says, "Which is
   easier?" as if He said, I indeed by the healing of the body, which is
   in reality more easy, but appears to you more difficult, will prove to
   you the health of the soul, which is really more difficult.

   Psuedo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: And because it is easier to
   say than to do, there was still manifestly something to say in
   opposition, for the work was not yet manifested.

   Wherefore He subjoins, "But that ye may know, &c." as if He said, Since
   ye doubt My word, I will bring on a work which will confirm what was
   unseen.

   But He says in a marked manner, "On earth to forgive sins," that He
   might shew that He has joined the power of the divinity to the human
   nature by an inseparable union, because although He was made man, yet
   He remained the Word of God; and although by an economy He conversed on
   the earth with men, nevertheless He was not prevented from working
   miracles and from giving remission of sins.

   For His human nature did not in any thing take away from these things
   which essentially belonged to His Divinity, nor the Divinity hinder the
   Word of God from becoming on earth, according to the flesh, the Son of
   Man without change and in truth.

   Theophylact: Again, He says, "Take up thy bed," to prove the greater
   certainty of the miracle, shewing that it is not a mere illusion; and
   at the same time to shew that He not only healed, but gave strength;
   thus He not only turns away souls from sin, but gives them the power of
   working out the commandments.

   Bede: A carnal sign therefore is given, that the spiritual sign may be
   proved, although it belongs to the same power to do away with the
   distempers of both soul and body.

   Whence it follows: "And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went
   forth before them all."

   Chrys.: Further, He first healed by the remission of sins that which He
   had come to seek, that is, a soul, so that when they faithlessly
   doubted, then He might bring forward a work before them, and in this
   way His word might be confirmed by the work, and a hidden sign be
   proved by an open one, that is, the health of the soul by the healing
   of the body.

   Bede: We are also informed, that many sicknesses of body arise from
   sins, and therefore perhaps sins are first remitted, that the causes of
   sickness being taken away, health may be restored. For men are
   afflicted by fleshly troubles for five causes, in order to increase
   their merits, as Job and the Martyrs; or to preserve their lowliness,
   as Paul by the messenger of Satan; or that they may perceive and
   correct their sins, as Miriam, the sister of Moses, and this paralytic;
   or for the glory of God, as the man born blind and Lazarus; or as the
   beginnings of the pains of damnation, as Herod and Antiochus.

   But wonderful is the virtue of the Divine power, where without the
   least interval of time, by the command of the Saviour, a speedy health
   accompanies His words.

   Wherefore there follows: "Insomuch that they were all amazed." Leaving
   the greater thing, that is, the remission of sins, they only wonder at
   that which is apparent, that is, the health of the body.

   Theophylact: This is not however the paralytic, whose cure is related
   by John, [John 5] for he had no man with him, this one had four; he is
   cured in the pool of the sheep market, but this one in a house. It is
   the same man, however, whose cure is related by Matthew [Matt. 9] and
   Mark.

   But mystically, Christ is still in Capernaum, in the house of
   consolation.

   Bede: Moreover, whilst the Lord is preaching in the house, there is not
   room for them, not even at the door, because whilst Christ is preaching
   in Judaea, the Gentiles are not yet able to enter to hear Him, to whom,
   however, though placed without, he directed the words of His doctrine
   by His preachers.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Again, the palsy is a type of the torpor, in which man
   lies slothful in the softness of the flesh, though desiring health.

   Theophlyact: If therefore I, having the powers of my mind unstrung,
   remain, whenever I attempt any thing good without strength, as a
   palsied man, and if I be raised on high by the four Evangelists, and be
   brought to Christ, and there hear myself called son, then also are my
   sins quitted by me; for a man is called the son of God because he works
   the commandments.

   Bede: Or else, because there are four virtues, by which a man is
   through an assured heart exalted so that he merits safety; which
   virtues some call prudence, fortitude, temperance and justice. Again,
   they desire to bring the palsied man to Christ, but they are impeded on
   every side by the crowd which is between them, because often the soul
   desires to be renewed by the medicine of Divine grace, but through the
   sluggishness of the grovelling body is held back by the hindrance of
   old custom. Oftentimes amidst the very sweetness of secret prayer, and,
   as it may be called, the pleasant converse with God, a crowd of
   thoughts, cutting off the clear vision of the mind, shuts out Christ
   from its sight.

   Let us not then remain in the lowest ground, where the crowds are
   bustling, but aim at the roof of the house, that is, the sublimity of
   the Holy Scripture, and meditate on the law of the Lord.

   Theophylact: But how should I be borne to Christ, if the roof be not
   opened. For the roof is the intellect, which is set above all those
   things which are within us; here it has much earth about it in the
   tiles which are made of clay, I mean, earthly things: but if these be
   taken away, the virtue of the intellect within us is freed from its
   load. After this let it be let down, that is, humbled. For it does not
   teach us to be puffed up, because our intellect has its load cleared
   away, but to be humbled still more.

   Bede: Or else, the sick man is let down after the roof is opened,
   because, when the Scriptures are laid open to us we arrive at the
   knowledge of Christ, that is, we descend to His lowliness, by the
   dutifulness of faith. But by the sick man being let down with his bed,
   it is meant that Christ should be known by man, whilst yet in the
   flesh.

   But by rising from the bed is meant the soul's rousing itself from
   carnal desires, in which it was lying in sickness. To take up the bed
   is to bridle the flesh itself by the bands of continence, and to
   separate it from earthly pleasures, through the hope of heavenly
   rewards.

   But to take up the bed and to go home is to return to paradise. Or else
   the man, now healed, who had been sick carries back home his bed, when
   the soul, after receiving remission of sins, returns, even though
   encompassed with the body, to its internal watch over itself.

   Theophylact: It is necessary to take up also one's bed, that is the
   body, to the working of good. For then shall we be able to arrive at
   contemplation, so that our thoughts should say within us, never have we
   seen in this way before, that is never understood as we have done since
   we have been cured of the palsy; for he who is cleansed from sin, sees
   more purely.

   13. And He went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
   resorted unto Him, and He taught them.

   14. And as He passed by, He saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at
   the receipt of custom, and said unto him, "Follow Me." And he arose and
   followed Him.

   15. And it came to pass, that as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many
   Publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and His disciples;
   for there were many, and they followed Him.

   16. And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw Him eat with Publicans and
   sinners, they said unto his disciples, "How is it that He eateth and
   drinketh with Publicans and sinners?"

   17. When Jesus heard it, He said unto them, "They that are whole have
   no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call
   the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: After that the Lord taught at Capernaum, He went to the sea, that
   He might not only set in order the life of men in towns, but also might
   preach the Gospel of the kingdom to those who dwelt near the sea, and
   might teach them to despise the restless motions of those things which
   pass away like the waves of the sea, and to overcome them by the
   firmness of faith.

   Wherefore it is said, "And He went forth again to the sea, and all the
   multitude, &c."

   Theophylact: Or else, after the miracle, He goes to the sea, as if
   wishing to be alone, but the crowd runs to Him again, that thou
   mightest learn, that the more thou fliest from glory, the more she
   herself pursues thee; but if thou followest her, she will fly from
   thee. The Lord passing on from thence called Matthew.

   Wherefore there follows, "And as He passed by, He saw Levi, the son of
   Alphaeus, sitting, &c."

   Chrys.: Now this is the same publican who is named by all the
   Evangelists; Matthew by Matthew; simply Levi by Luke; and Levi, the son
   of Alphaeus, by Mark; for he was the son of Alphaeus. And you may find
   persons with two names in other parts of Scripture; as Moses' father in
   law is sometimes called Jethro, sometimes Raguel.

   Bede, in Marc., 11: So also the same person is called Levi and Matthew;
   but Luke and Mark, on account of their reverence and the honour of the
   Evangelist, are unwilling to put the common name, while Matthew is a
   just accuser of himself, and calls himself Matthew and publican. He
   wishes to shew to his hearers that no one who is converted should
   despair of his salvation, since he himself was suddenly changed from a
   publican into an Apostle.

   but he says that he was sitting at the teloneum,' that is, the place
   where the customs are looked after and administered. For telos' in
   Greek is the same as vectigal,' customs, in Latin.

   Theophylact: For he sat at the receipt of custom, either, as is often
   done, exacting from some, or making up accounts, or doing some actions
   of that sort, which publicans are wont to do in their abodes, yea this
   man, who was raised on high from this state of life that he might leave
   all things and follow Christ.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And He saith to him, Follow Me, &c."

   Bede: Now to follow is to imitate, and therefore in order to imitate
   the poverty of Christ, in the feeling of his soul even more than in
   outward condition, he who used to rob his neighbour's wealth, now
   leaves his own. And not only did he quit the gain of the customs, but
   he also despised the peril, which might come from the princes of this
   world, because he left the accounts of the customs imperfect and
   unsettled. For the Lord Himself, Who externally, by human language,
   called Him to follow, inflamed him inwardly by divine inspiration to
   follow Him the moment that He called him.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Thus then Levi, which means Appointed, followed from the
   custom-house of human affairs, the Word, Who says, "He who doth not
   quit all that he has, cannot be My disciple."

   Theophylact: But he who used to plot against others becomes so
   benevolent, that he invites many persons to eat with him.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And it came to pass, that as Jesus sat at meat
   in his house."

   Bede, in Marc. i, 12: The persons here called publicans are those who
   exact the public customs, or men who farm the customs of the exchequer
   or of republics; moreover, those also, who follow after the gain of
   this world by business, are called by the same name. They who had seen
   that the publican, converted from his sins to better things, had found
   a place of pardon, even for this reason themselves also do not despair
   of salvation.

   And they come to Jesus, not remaining in their former sins, as the
   Pharisees and Scribes complain, but in penitence, as the following
   words of the Evangelist shew, saying, "For there were many who followed
   Him."

   For the Lord went to the feasts of sinners, that He might have an
   opportunity of teaching them, and might set before His entertainers
   spiritual meats, which also is carried on in mystical figures. For he
   who receives Christ into his inward habitation is fed with the highest
   delights of overflowing pleasures.

   Therefore the Lord enters willingly, and takes up His abode in the
   affection of him who hath believed on Him; and this is the spiritual
   banquet of good works, which the rich cannot have, and on which the
   poor feast.

   Theophylact: But the Pharisees blame this, making themselves pure.

   Whence there follows: "And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw Him eat,
   &c."

   Bede: If by the election of Matthew and calling of the publicans, the
   faith of the Gentiles is expressed, who formerly were intent on the
   gains of this world; certainly the haughtiness of the Scribes and
   Pharisees intimates the envy of the Jewish people, who are vexed at the
   salvation of the Gentiles.

   It goes on: "When Jesus heard it, He saith unto them, They that are
   whole need not the physician, but they that are sick."

   He aims at the Scribes and Pharisees, who, thinking themselves
   righteous, refused to keep company with sinners. He calls Himself the
   physician, Who, by a strange mode of healing, was wounded on account of
   our iniquities, and by His wound we are healed. And He calls those
   whole and righteous, who, wishing to establish their own righteousness,
   are not subject to the righteousness of God. Moreover He calls those
   rich and sinners, who, overcome by the consciousness of their own
   frailty, and seeing that they cannot be justified by the Law, submit
   their necks to the grace of Christ by repentance.

   Wherefore it is added, "For I came not to call the righteous, but
   sinners, &c."

   Theophylact: Not indeed that they should continue sinners, but be
   converted to that repentance.

   18. And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and
   they come and say unto Him, "Why do the disciples of John and of the
   Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?"

   19. And Jesus said unto them, "Can the children of the bridechamber
   fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the
   bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

   20. But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
   from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

   21. No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the
   new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is
   made worse.

   22. And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine
   doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will
   be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: As above, the Master was accused to the disciples for keeping
   company with sinners in their feasts, so now, on the other hand, the
   disciples are complained of to the Master for their omission of fasts,
   that so matter for dissension might arise amongst them.

   Wherefore it is said, "And the disciples of John and the Pharisees used
   to fast."

   Theophylact: For the disciples of John being in an imperfect state,
   continued in Jewish customs.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 27: But it may be thought that He added
   Pharisees, because they joined with the disciples of John in saying
   this to the Lord, whilst Matthew relates that the disciples of John
   alone said it: but the words which follow father shew that those who
   said it spoke not of themselves, but of others.

   For it goes on, "And they came and say unto Him, Why do the disciples,
   &c."

   For these words shew, that the guests who were there came to Jesus, and
   had said this same thing to the disciples, so that in the words which
   he uses, "they came," he speaks not of those same persons, of whom he
   had said, "And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting."
   But as they were fasting, those persons who remembered it, come to Him.
   Matthew then says this, "And there came to Him the disciples of John,
   saying," because the Apostles also were there, and all eagerly, as each
   could, objected these things.

   Chrys.: The disciples of John, therefore, and of the Pharisees, being
   jealous of Christ, ask Him, whether He alone of all men with His
   disciples could, without abstinence and toil, conquer in the fight of
   the passions.

   Bede: But John did not drink wine and strong drink, because he who has
   no power by nature, obtains more merit by abstinence. But why should
   the Lord, to whom it naturally belonged to forgive sins, shun those
   whom he could make more pure, than those who fast? But Christ also
   fasted, lest He should break the precept, "He ate with sinners," that
   thou mightest see His grace, and acknowledge His power.

   It goes on; "And Jesus said unto them, Can the children, &c."

   Augustine: Mark here calls them children of the nuptials, whom Matthew
   calls children of the bridegroom; for we understand the children of the
   nuptials to be not only those of the bridegroom, but also of the bride.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He then calls Himself a
   bridegroom, as if about to be betrothed to the Church. For the
   betrothal is giving an earnest, namely, that the grace of the Holy
   Ghost, by which the world believed.

   Theophylact: He also calls Himself a bridegroom, not only as betrothing
   to Himself virgin minds, but because the time of His first coming is
   not a time of sorrow, nor of sadness to believers, neither does it
   bring with it toil, but rest.

   For it is without any works of the law, giving rest by baptism, by
   which we easily obtain salvation without toil. But the sons of the
   nuptials or of the Bridegroom are the Apostles; because they, by the
   grace of God, are made worthy of every heavenly blessing, by the grace
   of God, and partakers of every joy.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But intercourse with Him, He
   says, is far removed from all sorrow, when He adds, "As long as they
   have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast." He is said, from whom
   some good is far removed; but he who has it present with him rejoices,
   and is not sad. But that He might destroy their elation of heart, and
   shew that He intended not His own disciples to be licentious, He adds,
   "But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken, &c." as if
   He said, The time will come, when they will shew their firmness; for
   when the Bridegroom shall be taken from them, they will fast as longing
   for His coming, and in order to unite to Him their spirits, cleansed by
   bodily suffering.

   He shews also that there is no necessity for His disciples to fast, as
   having present with them the Bridegroom of human nature, Who every
   where executes the words of God, and Who gives the seed of life.

   The sons of the Bridegroom also cannot, because they are infants, be
   entirely conformed to their Father, the Bridegroom, Who, considering
   their infancy, deigns to allow them not to fast: but when the
   Bridegroom is gone, they will fast, through desire of Him; when they
   have been made perfect, they will be united to the Bridegroom in
   marriage, and will always feast at the king's banquet.

   Theophylact: We must also understand that every man whose works are
   good is the son of the Bridegroom; he has the Bridegroom with him, even
   Christ, and fasts not, that is, does no works of repentance, because he
   does not sin: but when the Bridegroom is taken away by the man's
   falling into sin, then he fasts and is penitent, that he may cure his
   sin.

   Bede: But in a mystical sense, it may thus be expressed; that the
   disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, because every man who boasts
   of the works of the law without faith, who follows the traditions of
   men, and receives the preaching of Christ with his bodily ear, and not
   by the faith of the heart, keeps aloof from spiritual goods, and wastes
   away with a fasting soul. But he who is incorporated into the members
   of Christ by a faithful love cannot fast, because he feasts upon His
   Body and Blood.

   It goes on, "No one seweth a piece of" rough, that is, "new, cloth on
   an old garment: else the new piece that filleth it up taketh away from
   the old, and the rent is made worse."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: As if He said, because these
   are preachers of the New Testament, it is not possible that they should
   serve old laws; but ye who follow old customs, fitly observe the fasts
   of Moses. But for these, who are about to hand down to men new and
   wonderful observances, it is not necessary to observe the old
   traditions, but to be virtuous in mind; some time or other however they
   will observe fasting with other virtues. But this fasting is different
   from the fasting of the law, for that was one of restraint, this of
   goodwill; on account of the fervour of the Spirit, Whom they cannot yet
   receive.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And no one putteth new wine into old bottles:
   else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and
   the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put in new bottles."

   Bede: For He compares His disciples to old bottles, who would burst at
   spiritual precepts, rather than be held in restraint by them. But they
   will be new bottles, when after the ascension of the Lord, they are
   renewed by desiring His consolation, and then new wine will come to the
   new bottles, that is, the fervour of the Holy Ghost will fill the
   hearts of spiritual men. A teacher must also take heed not to commit
   the hidden things of the new mysteries to a soul, hardened in old
   wickedness.

   Theophylact: Or else the disciples are likened to old garments on
   account of the infirmity of their minds, on which it was not fitting to
   impose the heavy command of fasting.

   Bede: Neither was it fitting to sew on a new piece; that is, a portion
   of doctrine which teaches a general fast from all the joy of temporal
   delights; for if this be done, the teaching is rent, and agrees not
   with the old part. But by a new garment is intended good works, which
   are done externally, and by the new wine, is expressed the fervour of
   faith, hope, and charity, by which we are reformed in our minds.

   23. And it came to pass, that He went through the corn fields on the
   sabbath day; and His disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears
   of corn.

   24. And the Pharisees said unto Him, "Behold, why do they on the
   sabbath day that which is not lawful?"

   25. And He said unto them, "Have ye never read what David did, when he
   had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?

   26. How he went into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar the High
   Priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for
   the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?"

   27. And He said unto them, "The sabbath was made for man, and not man
   for the sabbath:

   28. Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: The disciples of Christ,
   freed from the figure, and united to the truth, do not keep the
   figurative feast of the sabbath.

   Wherefore it is said, "And it came to pass, that He went through the
   corn fields on the sabbath day; and His disciples began, as they went,
   to pluck the ears of corn."

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 13: We read also in the following part, that they
   who came and went away were many, and that they had not time enough to
   take their food, wherefore, according to man's nature, they were
   hungry.

   Chrys., see Hom. in Matt., 39: But being hungry, they ate simple food,
   not for pleasure, but on account of the necessity of nature. The
   Pharisees however, serving the figure and the shadow, accused the
   disciples of doing wrong.

   Wherefore there follows, "But the Pharisees said unto Him, Behold, why
   do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful."

   Augustine, de Op. Monach., 23: For it was a precept in Israel,
   delivered by a written law, that no one should detain a thief found in
   his fields, unless he tried to take something away with him. For the
   man who had touched nothing else but what he had eaten they were
   commanded to allow to go away free and unpunished. Wherefore the Jews
   accused our Lord's disciples, who were plucking the ears of corn, of
   breaking the sabbath, rather than of theft.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But our Lord brings forward
   David, to whom it once happened to eat though it was forbidden by the
   law, when he touched the Priest's food, that by his example, He might
   do away with their accusation of the disciples.

   For there follows, "Have ye never read, &c."

   Theophylact: For David, when flying from the face of Saul [1 Sam 21]
   went to the Chief Priest, and ate the shew-bread, and took away the
   sword of Goliath, which things had been offered to the Lord. But a
   question has been raised how the Evangelist called Abiathar at this
   time High Priest, when the Book of Kings calls him Abimelech.

   Bede: There is, however, no discrepancy, for both were there, when
   David came to ask for bread, and received it: that is to say,
   Abimelech, the High Priest, and Abiathar his son; but Abimelech having
   been slain by Saul, Abiathar fled to David, and became the companion of
   all his exile afterwards. When he came to the throne, he himself also
   received the rank of High Priest, and the son became of much greater
   excellence than the father, and therefore was worthy to be mentioned as
   the High Priest, even during his father's life-time.

   It goes on: "And He said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not
   man for the sabbath."

   For greater is the care to be taken of the health and life of a man,
   than the keeping of the sabbath. Therefore the sabbath was ordered to
   be observed in such a way, that, if there were a neccesity, he should
   not be guilty, who broke the sabbath-day; therefore it was not
   forbidden to circumcise on the sabbath, because that was a necessary
   work. And the Maccabees, when necessity pressed on them, fought on the
   sabbath-day.

   Wherefore, His disciples being hungry, what was not allowed in the law
   became lawful through their necessity of hunger; as now, if a sick man
   break a fast, he is not held guilty in any way.

   It goes on: "Therefore the Son of man is Lord, &c." As if He said,
   David the king is to be excused for feeding on the food of the Priests,
   how much more the Son of man, the true King and Priest, and Lord of the
   sabbath, is free from fault, for pulling ears of corn on the
   sabbath-day.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He calls himself properly,
   Lord of the sabbath, and Son of man, since being the Son of God, He
   deigned to be called Son of man, for the sake of men. Now the law has
   no authority over the Lawgiver and Lord, for more is allowed the king,
   than is appointed by the law. The law is given to the weak indeed, but
   not to the perfect and to those who work above what the law enjoins.

   Bede: But in a mystical sense the disciples pass through the corn
   fields, when the holy doctors look with the care of a pious solicitude
   upon those whom they have initiated in the faith, and who, it is
   implied, are hungering for the best of all things, the salvation of
   men.

   But to pluck the ears of corn means to snatch men away from the eager
   desire of earthly things. And to rub with the hands is by example of
   virtue to put from the purity of their minds the concupiscence of the
   flesh, as men do husks. To eat the grains is when a man, cleansed from
   the filth of vice by the mouths of preachers, is incorporated amongst
   the members of the Church.

   Again, fitly are the disciples related to have done this, walking
   before the face of the Lord, for it is necessary that the discourse of
   the doctor should come first, although the grace of visitation from on
   high, following it, must enlighten the heart of the hearer. As well, on
   the sabbath-day, for the doctors themselves in preaching labour for the
   hope of future rest, and teach their hearers to toil over their tasks
   for the sake of eternal repose.

   Theophylact: Or else, because when they have rest from their passions,
   then are they made doctors to lead others to virtue, plucking away from
   them earthly things.

   Bede: Again, they walk through the corn fields with the Lord, who
   rejoice in meditating upon His sacred words. They hunger, when they
   desire to find in them the bread of life; and they hunger on sabbath
   days, as soon as their minds are in a soothing rest, and they rejoice
   in freedom from troubled thoughts; they pluck the ears of corn, and by
   rubbing, cleanse them, till they come to what is fit to eat, when by
   meditation they take to themselves the witness of the Scriptures, to
   which they arrive by reading, and discuss them continually, until they
   find in them the marrow of love; this refreshment of the mind is truly
   unpleasing to fools, but is approved by the Lord.

Chapter 3

   1. And He entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there
   which had a withered hand.

   2. And they watched Him, whether He would heal him on the sabbath day;
   that they might accuse Him.

   3. And He saith unto the man which had the withered hand, "Stand
   forth."

   4. And He saith unto them, "Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
   days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?" But they held their
   peace.

   5. And when He had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved
   for the hardness of their hearts, He saith unto the man, "Stretch forth
   thine hand." And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole
   as the other.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After confounding the Jews, who had blamed His disciples,
   for pulling the ears of corn on the sabbath day, by the example of
   David, the Lord now further bringing them to the truth, works a miracle
   on the sabbath; shewing that, if it is a pious deed to work miracles on
   the sabbath for the health of men, it is not wrong to do on the sabbath
   thing necessary for the body.

   He says therefore, "And He entered again into the synagogue; and there
   was a man there which had a withered hand. And they watched Him,
   whether He would heal him on the sabbath-day; that they might accuse
   Him."

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 14: For, since He had defended the breaking of the
   sabbath, which they objected to His disciples, by an approved example,
   now they wish, by watching Him, to calumniate Himself, that they might
   accuse Him of a transgression, if He cured on the sabbath, of cruelty
   or of folly, if He refused.

   It goes on: "And He saith unto the man which had the withered hand,
   Stand in the midst."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., see Chrys, Hom. in Matt.,
   40: He placed him in the midst, that they might be frightened at the
   sight, and on seeing Him compassionate him, and lay aside their malice.

   Bede: And anticipating the calumny of the Jews, which they had prepared
   for Him, He accused them of violating the precepts of the law, by a
   wrong interpretation.

   Wherefore there follows: "And He saith unto them, Is it lawful to do
   good on the sabbath-day, or to do evil?"

   And this He asks, because they thought that on the sabbath they were to
   rest even from good works, whilst the law commands to abstain from bad,
   saying, "Ye shall do no servile work therein;" [Lev 23:7] that is, sin:
   for "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." [John 8:34]

   What He first says, "to do good on the sabbath-day or to do evil," is
   the same as what He afterwards adds, "to save a life or to lose it;"
   that is, to cure a man or not. Not that God, Who is in the highest
   degree good, can be the author of perdition to us, but that His not
   saving is in the language of Scripture to destroy.

   but if it be asked, wherefore the Lord, being about to cure the body,
   asked about the saving of the soul, let him understand either that in
   the common way of Scripture the soul is put for the man; as it is said,
   "All the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob;" [Ex 1:5] or
   because He did those miracles for the saving of a soul, or because the
   healing itself of the hand signified the saving of the soul.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 35: But some one may wonder how Matthew
   could have said, that they themselves asked the Lord, if it was lawful
   to heal on the sabbath-day; when Mark rather relates that they were
   asked by our Lord, "Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath-day, or to
   do evil?"

   Therefore we must understand that they first asked the Lord, if it was
   lawful to heal on the sabbath-day, then that understanding their
   thoughts, and that they were seeking an opportunity to accuse Him, He
   placed in the middle him whom He was about to cure, and put those
   questions, which Mark and Luke relate. We must then suppose, that when
   they were silent, He propounded the parable of the sheep, and
   concluded, that it was lawful to do good on the sabbath-day.

   It goes on: "But they were silent." Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in
   Marc.: For they knew that He would certainly cure him.

   It goes on: "And looking round about upon them with anger."

   His looking round upon them in anger, and being saddened at the
   blindness of their hearts, is fitting for His humanity, which He
   deigned to take upon Himself for us. He connects the working of the
   miracle with a word, which proves that the man is cured by His voice
   alone.

   It follow therefore, "And he stretched it out, and his hand was
   restored." Answering by all these things for His disciples, and at the
   same time shewing that His life is above the law.

   Bede: But mystically, the man with a withered hand shews the human
   race, dried up as to its fruitfulness in good works, but now cured by
   the mercy of the Lord; the hand of man, which in our first parent had
   been dried up when he plucked the fruit of the forbidden tree, through
   the grace of the Redeemer, Who stretched His guiltless hands on the
   tree of the cross, has been restored to health by the juices of good
   works.

   Well too was it in the synagogue that the hand was withered; for where
   the gift of knowledge is greater, there also the danger of inexcusable
   guilt is greater.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else it means the avaricious, who, being able to give
   had rather receive, and love robbery rather than making gifts. And they
   are commanded to stretch forth their hands, that is, "let him that
   stole steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hand
   the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth."
   [Eph 4:28]

   Theophylact: Or, he had his right hand withered, who does not the works
   which belong to the right side; for from the time that our hand is
   employed in forbidden deeds, from that time it is withered to the
   working of good. But it will be restored whenever it stands firm in
   virtue; wherefore Christ saith, "Arise," that is, from sin, "and stand
   in the midst;" that thus it may stretch itself forth neither too little
   nor too much.

   6. And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the
   Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.

   7. But Jesus withdrew Himself with His disciples to the sea: and a
   great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judaea,

   8. And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and
   they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what
   great things He did, came unto Him.

   9. And He spake to His disciples, that a small ship should wait on Him,
   because of the multitude, lest they should throng Him.

   10. For He had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon Him for to
   touch Him, as many as had plagues.

   11. And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him, and
   cried, saying, "Thou art the Son of God."

   12. And He straitly charged them that they should not make Him known.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 15: The Pharisees, thinking it a crime that at the
   word of the Lord the hand which was diseased was restored to a sound
   state, agreed to make a pretext of the words spoken by our Saviour.

   Wherefore it is said, "And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway
   took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy
   Him."

   As if every one amongst them did not greater things on the sabbath day,
   carrying food, reaching forth a cup, and whatever else is necessary for
   meals. Neither could He, Who said and it was done, be convicted of
   toiling on the sabbath day.

   Theophylact: But the soldiers of Herod the king are called Herodians,
   because a certain new heresy had sprung up, which asserted that Herod
   was the Christ. For the prophecy of Jacob intimated that when the
   princes of Judah failed then Christ should come; because therefore in
   the time of Herod none of the Jewish princes remained, and he, an
   alien, was the sole ruler, some thought that he was the Christ, and set
   on foot this heresy. These, therefore, were with the Pharisees trying
   to kill Christ.

   Bede: Or else he calls Herodians the servants of Herod the Tetrarch,
   who on account of the hatred which their lord had for John, pursued
   with treachery and hate the Saviour also, Whom John preached.

   It goes on, "But Jesus withdrew Himself with His disciples to the sea;"
   He fled from their treachery, because the hour of His passion had not
   yet come, and no place away from Jerusalem was proper for His Passion.
   By which also He gave an example to His disciples, when they suffer
   persecution in one city, to flee to another.

   Theophylact: At the same time again, He goes away, that by quitting the
   ungrateful He might do good to more, "for many followed Him, and He
   healed them."

   For there follows, "And a great multitude from Galilee, &c." Syrians
   and Sidonians, being foreigners, receive benefit from Christ; but His
   kindred the Jews persecute Him: thus there is no profit in
   relationship, if there be not a similarity in goodness.

   Bede: For the strangers followed Him, because they saw the works of His
   powers, and in order to hear the words of His teaching. But the Jews,
   induced solely by their opinion of His powers, in a vast multitude come
   to hear Him, and to beg for His aiding health.

   Wherefore there follows, "And He spake to His disciples, that they
   should wait, &c."

   Theophylact: Consider then how He hid His glory, for He begs for a
   little ship, lest the crowd should hurt Him, so that entering into it,
   He might remain unharmed.

   It follows, "As many as had scourges, &c."

   But he means by scourges, diseases, for God scourges us, as a father
   does His children.

   Bede: Both therefore fell down before the Lord, those who had the
   plagues of bodily diseases, and those who were vexed by unclean
   spirits. The sick did this simply with the intention of obtaining
   health, but the demoniacs, or rather the devils within them, because
   under the mastery of a fear of God they were compelled not only to fall
   down before Him but also to praise His majesty.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And they cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of
   God."

   And here we must wonder at the blindness of the Arians, who, after the
   glory of His resurrection, deny the Son of God, Whom the devils confess
   to be the Son of God, though still clothed with human flesh.

   There follows, "And He straitly charged them, that they should not make
   Him known."

   For God said to the sinner, "Why does thou preach my laws?" [Ps 50:16]
   A sinner is forbidden to preach the Lord, lest any one listening to his
   preaching should follow him in his error, for the devil is an evil
   master, who always mingles false things with true, that the semblance
   of truth may cover the witness of fraud.

   But not only devils, but persons healed by Christ, and even Apostles,
   are ordered to be silent concerning Him before the Passion, lest by the
   preaching of the majesty of His Divinity, the economy of His Passion
   should be retarded. But allegorically, in the Lord's coming out of the
   synagogue, and then retiring to the sea, He prefigured the salvation of
   the Gentiles, to whom He deigned to come through their faith, having
   quitted the Jews on account of their perfidy.

   For the nations, driven about in divers by-paths of error, are fitly
   compared to the unstable sea. [ed. note: see Cyprian, Ep. 63, also
   Augustine, City of God, Book 20, 16]

   Again, a great crowd from various provinces followed Him, because He
   has received with kindness many nations, who came to Him through the
   preaching of the Apostles. But the ship waiting upon the Lord in the
   sea is the Church, collected from amongst the nations; and He goes into
   it lest the crowd should throng Him, because flying from the troubled
   minds of carnal persons, He delights to come to those who despise the
   glory of this world, and to dwell within them.

   Further, there is a difference between thronging the Lord, and touching
   Him; for they throng Him, when by carnal thoughts and deeds they
   trouble peace, in which truth dwells; but he touches Him, who by faith
   and love has received Him into his heart; wherefore those who touched
   Him are said to have been saved.

   Theophylact: Morally again, the Herodians, that is, persons who love
   the lusts of the flesh, wish to slay Christ. For the meaning of Herod
   is, of skin' [ed. note: pelliceus, see Hier. de Nom. Hebr.]. But those
   who quit their country, that is, a carnal mode of living, follow
   Christ, and their plagues are healed, that is, the sins which wound
   their conscience. But Jesus in us is our reason, which commands that
   our vessel, that is, our body, should serve Him, lest the troubles of
   worldly affairs should press upon our reason.

   13. And He goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto Him whom He
   would: and they came unto Him.

   14. And He ordained twelve, that they should be with Him, and that He
   might send them forth to preach,

   15. And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:

   16. And Simon He surnamed Peter;

   17. And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and He
   surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:

   18. And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas,
   and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,

   19. And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 16: After having forbidden the evil spirits to
   preach Him, He chose holy men, to cast out the unclean spirits, and to
   preach the Gospel.

   Wherefore it is said, "And He went up into a mountain, &c."

   Theophylact: Luke, however, says that He went up to pray, for after the
   shewing forth of miracles He prays, teaching us that we should give
   thanks, when we obtain any thing good, and refer it to Divine grace.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He also instructs the
   Prelates of the Church to pass the night in prayer before they ordain,
   that their office be not impeded. When therefore, according to Luke, it
   was day, He called whom He would; for there were many who followed Him.

   Bede: For it was not a matter of their choice and zeal, but of Divine
   condescension and grace, that they should be called to the Apostleship.
   The mount also in which the Lord chose His Apostles, shews the lofty
   righteousness in which they were to be instructed, and which they were
   about to preach to men.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or spiritually, Christ is the mount, from which living
   waters flow, and milk is procured for the health of infants; whence the
   spiritual feast of fat things is made known, and whatsoever is believed
   to be most highly good is established by the grace of that Mountain.

   Those therefore who are highly exalted in merits and in words are
   called up into a mountain, that the place may correspond to the
   loftiness of their merits.

   It goes on: "And they came unto Him, &c."

   For the Lord loved the beauty of Jacob, [Ps 46] that they might "sit
   upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel," [Matt 19:28]
   who also in bands of threes and fours watch around the tabernacle of
   the Lord, and carry the holy words of the Lord, bearing them forward on
   their actions, as men do burdens on their shoulders.

   Bede: For as a sacrament of this the children of Israel once used to
   encamp about the Tabernacle, so that on each of the four sides of the
   square three tribes were stationed. Now three times four are twelve,
   and in three bands of four the Apostles were sent to preach, that
   through the four quarters of the whole world they might baptize the
   nations in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

   It goes on: "And He gave them power, &c."

   that is, in order that the greatness of their deeds might bear witness
   to the greatness of their heavenly promises, and that they, who
   preached unheard-of things, might do unheard-of actions.

   Theophylact: Further, He gives the names of the Apostles, that the true
   Apostles might be known, so that men might avoid the false.

   And therefore it continues: "And Simon He surnamed Cephas."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan. ii, 17: But let no one suppose that Simon now
   received his name and was called Peter, for thus he would make Mark
   contrary to John, who relates that it had been long before said unto
   him, "Thou shalt be called Cephas." [John 1:42]

   But Mark gives this account by way of recapitulation; for as he wished
   to give the names of the twelve Apostles, and was obliged to call him,
   Peter, his object was to intimate briefly, that he was not called this
   originally, but that the Lord gave him that name.

   Bede: And the reason that the Lord willed that he should at first be
   called otherwise, was that from the change itself of the name, a
   mystery might be conveyed to us. Peter then in Latin or in Greek means
   the same thing as Cephas in Hebrew, and in each language the name is
   drawn from, a stone.

   Nor can it be doubted that is the rock of which Paul spoke, "And this
   rock was Christ." [1 Cor 10:4] For as Christ was the true light, and
   allowed also that the Apostles should be called the light of the world,
   [Matt 5:14] so also to Simon, who believed on the rock Christ, He gave
   the name of Rock.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Thus from obedience, which Simon signifies, the ascent
   is made to knowledge, which is meant by Peter.

   It goes on: "And James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother."

   Bede: We must connect this with what went before, "He goeth up into a
   mountain, and calleth."

   Pseudo-Jerome, Gen. 27:36 see Catena Aurea, Matt. 10:2: Namely, James
   who has supplanted all the desires of the flesh, and John, who received
   by grace what others held by labour.

   There follows: "And He surnamed them, Boanerges."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He calls the sons of Zebedee
   by this name, because they were to spread over the world the mighty and
   illustrious decrees of the Godhead.

   Pseudo-Jerome; Or by this the lofty merit of the three mentioned above
   is shewn, who merited to hear in the mountain the thunders of the
   Father, when he proclaimed in thunder through a could concerning the
   Son, "This is My beloved Son;" that they also through the cloud of the
   flesh and fire of the word, might as it were scatter the thunderbolts
   in rain on the earth, since the Lord turned the thunderbolts into rain,
   so that mercy extinguishes what judgment sets on fire.

   It goes on: "And Andrew," who manfully does violence to perdition, so
   that he had ever ready within him his own death, to give as an answer,
   [1 Pet 3:15] and his soul was ever in his hands. [Ps 119:109]

   Bede: For Andrew is a Greek name, which means manly,' from (greek
   word), that is, man, for he manfully adhered to the Lord.

   There follows, "And Philip."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or, the mouth of a lamp,' that is, one who can throw
   light by his mouth upon what he has conceived in his heart, to whom the
   Lord gave the opening of a mouth, which diffused light. We know that
   this mode of speaking belongs to holy Scripture; for Hebrew names are
   put down in order to intimate a mystery.

   There follows: "And Bartholomew," which means, the son of him who
   suspends the waters; of him, that is, who said, "I will also command
   the clouds that they rain no rain upon it." [Isa 5:6]

   But the name of son of God is obtained by peace and loving one's enemy;
   for, Blessed are the peacemakers, for they are the sons of God. [Matt
   5:9] And, Love your enemies, that ye may be the sons of God. [see Matt
   5:44-45]

   There follows: "And Matthew," that is, given,' to whom it is given by
   the Lord, not only to obtain remission of sins, but to be enrolled in
   the number of the Apostles.

   "And Thomas," which means, abyss,' for men who have knowledge by the
   power of God, put forward many deep things.

   It goes on: "And James the son of Alphaeus," that is, of the learned,'
   or the thousandth,' beside whom a thousand will fall. [Ps 91:7] This
   other James is he, whose wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but
   against spiritual wickedness. [Eph 6:12]

   There follows, "And Thaddaeus," that is, corculum,' which means, he who
   guards the heart' [ed. note: cordis cultor'] , one who keeps his heart
   in all watchfulness.

   Bede: But Thaddaeus is the same person, as Luke calls in the Gospel and
   in the Acts, Jude of James, for he was the brother of James, the
   brother of the Lord, as he himself has written in his Epistle.

   There follows, "And Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who
   betrayed Him."

   He has added this by way of distinction from Simon Peter, and Jude the
   brother of James. Simon is called the Canaanite from Cana, a village in
   Galilee, and Judas, Scariotes, from the village from which he had his
   origin, or he is so called from the tribe of Issachar.

   Theophylact: Whom he reckons amongst the Apostles, that we may learn
   that God does not repel any man for wickedness, which is future, but
   counts him worthy on account of his present virtue.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But Simon in interpreted, laying aside sorrow;' for
   "blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted." [Matt 5:4]

   And he is called Canaanite, that is, Zealot, because the zeal of the
   Lord ate him up. But Judas Iscariot is one who does not do away his
   sins by repentance. For Judas means, boaster,' or vain-glorious. And
   Iscariot, the memory of death.' But many are the proud and
   vain-glorious confessors in the Church, as Simon Magus, and Arius, and
   other heretics, whose deathlike memory is celebrated in the Church,
   that it may be avoided.

   19. ------ And they went into an house.

   20. And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so
   much as eat bread.

   21. And when His friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on Him:
   for they said, "He is beside himself."

   22. And the Scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, "He hath
   Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth He out devils."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: the Lord leads the Apostles, when they were elected, into a
   house, as if admonishing them, that after having received the
   Apostleship, they should retire to look on their own consciences.

   Wherefore it is said, "And they came into a house, and the multitude
   came together again, so that they could not eat bread."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Ungrateful indeed were the
   multitudes of princes, whom their pride hinders from knowledge, but the
   grateful multitude of the people came to Jesus.

   Bede: And blessed indeed the concourse of the crowd, flocking together,
   whose anxiety to obtain salvation was so great, that they left not the
   Author of salvation even an hour free to take food. But Him, whom a
   crowd of strangers loves to follow, His relations hold in little
   esteem.

   For it goes on, "And when His friends heard of it, they went out to lay
   hold upon Him."

   For since they could not take in the depth of wisdom, which they heard,
   they thought that He was speaking in a senseless way.

   Wherefore it continues, "for they said, He is beside Himself."

   Theophylact: That is, He has a devil and is mad, and therefore they
   wished to lay hold upon Him, that they might shut Him up as one who had
   a devil. And even His friends wished to do this, that is, His
   relations, perchance His countrymen, or His brethren. But it was a
   silly insanity in them, to conceive that the Worker of such great
   miracles of Divine Wisdom had become mad.

   Bede: Now there is a great difference between those who do not
   understand the word of God from slowness of intellect, such as those
   who are here spoken of, and those who purposely blaspheme, of whom it
   is added, "And the Scribes which came down from Jerusalem, &c." For
   what they could not deny they endeavour to pervert by a malicious
   interpretation, as if they were not the works of God, but of a most
   unclean spirit, that is, of Beelzebub, who was the God of Ekrom.

   For Beel' means Baal himself, and zebub' a fly; the meaning of
   Beelzebub therefore is, the man of flies, on account of the filth of
   the blood which was offered, from which most unclean rite, they call
   him prince of the devils, adding, "and by the prince of the devils
   casteth He out devils."

   Pseudo-Jerome: But mystically, the house to which they came, is the
   early Church. The crowds which prevent their eating bread are sins and
   vices; for he who eateth unworthily, "eateth and drinketh damnation to
   himself." [1 Cor 11:29]

   Bede: The Scribes also coming down from Jerusalem blaspheme. But the
   multitude from Jerusalem, and from other regions of Judaea, or of the
   Gentiles, followed the Lord, because so it was to be at the time of His
   Passion, that a crowd of the people of the Jews should lead Him to
   Jerusalem with palms and praises, and the Gentiles should desire to see
   Him; but the Scribes and Pharisees should plot together for His death.

   men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:

   29. But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
   forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:"

   30. Because they said, "He hath an unclean spirit."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: The blasphemy of the Scribes
   having been detailed, our Lord shews that what they said was
   impossible, confirming His proof by an example.

   Wherefore it says, "And having called them together unto Him, He said
   unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?" As if He had
   said, A kingdom divided against itself by civil war must be desolated,
   which is exemplified both in a house and in a city. Wherefore also if
   Satan's kingdom by divided against itself, so that Satan expels Satan
   from men, the desolation of the kingdom of the devils is at hand.

   But their kingdom consists in keeping men under their dominion. If
   therefore they are driven away from men, it amounts to nothing less
   than the dissolution of their kingdom. But if they still hold their
   power over men, it is manifest that the kingdom of evil is still
   standing, and Satan is not divided against himself.

   Gloss.: And because He has already shewn by an example that a devil
   cannot cast out a devil, He shews how he can be expelled, saying, "No
   man can enter into a strong man's house, &c."

   Theophylact: The meaning of the example is this: The devil is the
   strong man; his goods are the men into whom he is received; unless
   therefore a man first conquers the devil, how can he deprive him of his
   goods, that is, of the men whom he has possessed?

   So also I who spoil his goods, that is, free men from suffering by his
   possession, first spoil the devils and vanquish them, and am their
   enemy. How then can ye say that I have Beelzebub and that being the
   friend of the devils, I cast them out?

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 17: The Lord has also bound the strong man, that is,
   the devil: which means, He has restrained him from seducing the elect,
   and entering into his house, the world; He has spoiled his house, and
   his goods, that is men, because He has snatched them from the snares of
   the devil, and has united them to His Church.

   Or, He has spoiled his house, because the four parts of the world, over
   which the old enemy had sway, He has distributed to the Apostles and
   their successors, that they may convert the people to the way of life.

   But the Lord shews that they committed a great sin in crying out that
   which they knew to be of God, was of the devil, when He subjoins,
   "Verily, I say unto you, All sins are forgiven, &c." All sins and
   blasphemies are not indeed remitted to all men, but to those who have
   gone through a repentance in this life sufficient for their sins; thus
   neither is Novatus right [ed. note: Novatus was a Carthaginian
   presbyter, who, after having abetted Felicissimus in his schism against
   St. Cyprian, came to Rome and joined Novatian against Pope Cornelius,
   A.D. 251. His error, which is here opposed to Origen's , consisted in
   denying that Christ had left with His Church the power of absolving
   from certain sins, especially from apostasy.], who denied that any
   pardon should be granted to penitents, who had lapsed in time of
   martyrdom; nor Origen, who asserts that after the general judgment,
   after the revolution of ages, all sinners will receive pardon for their
   sins, which error the following words of the Lord condemn, when He
   adds, "But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, &c."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He says indeed, that
   blasphemy concerning Himself was pardonable, because He then seemed to
   be a man despised and of the most lowly birth, but, that contumely
   against God has no remission. Now blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is
   against God, for the operation of the Holy Ghost is the kingdom of God;
   and for this reason, He says, that blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
   cannot be remitted. Instead, however, of what is here added, "But will
   be in danger of eternal damnation," another Evangelist says, "Neither
   in this world, nor in the world to come." By which is understood, the
   judgment which is according to the law, and that which is to come.

   For the law orders one who blasphemes God to be slain, and in the
   judgment of the second law he has no remission. However, he who is
   baptized is taken out of this world; but the Jews were ignorant of the
   remission which takes place in baptism. [ed. note: A few words are left
   out in the Catena, which occur in Victor, and which do away with the
   obscurity of the passage. The missing of the whole is, that though
   there is no remission either in this world or in the next, yet that
   baptism is, as it were, a space between the two worlds, where remission
   can be obtained. The reason, therefore, why this blasphemy could not be
   remitted, was, because the Jews would not come to Christ's baptism.]

   He therefore who refers to the devil miracles, and the casting out of
   devils which belong to the Holy Ghost alone, has no room left him for
   remission of his blasphemy. Neither does it appear that such a
   blasphemy as this is remitted, since it is against the Holy Ghost.

   Wherefore he adds, explaining it, "Because they said, He hath an
   unclean spirit."

   Theophylact: We must however understand, that they will not obtain
   pardon unless they repent. But since it was at the flesh of Christ that
   they were offended, even though they did not repent, some excuse was
   allowed them, and they obtained some remission.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or this is meant; that he will not deserve to work out
   repentance, so as to be accepted, who, understanding who Christ was,
   declared that He was the prince of the devils.

   Bede: Neither however are those, who do not believe the Holy Spirit to
   be God, guilty of an unpardonable blasphemy, because they were
   persuaded to do this by human ignorance, not by devilish malice.

   Augustine, Serm., 71, 12, 22: Or else impenitence itself is the
   blasphemy against the Holy Ghost which hath no remission. For either in
   his thought or by his tongue, he speaks a word against the Holy Ghost,
   the forgiver of sins, who treasures up for himself an impenitent heart.

   But he subjoins, "Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit," that
   he might shew that His reason for saying it, was their declaring that
   He cast out a devil by Beelzebub, not because there is a blasphemy,
   which cannot be remitted, since even this might be remitted through a
   right repentance; but the cause why this sentence was put forth by the
   Lord, after mentioning the unclean spirit, (who as our Lord shews was
   divided against himself,) was, that the Holy Ghost even makes those
   whom He brings together undivided, by His remitting those sins, which
   divided them from Himself, which gift of remission is resisted by no
   one, but him who has the hardness of an impenitent heart.

   For in another place, the Jews said of the Lord, that He had a devil
   [John 7:20], without however His saying any thing there about the
   blasphemy against the Spirit; and the reason is, that they did not
   there cast in His teeth the unclean spirit, in such a way, that spirit
   could by their own words be shewn to be divided against Himself, as
   Beelzebub was here shewn to be, by their saying, that it might be he
   who cast out devils. [ed. note: St. Augustine explains his meaning by
   going on to say, that as the Devil was proved by the words of the Jews
   to be the author of division, so the Holy Ghost was the author of
   unity, so that one form of blasphemy of the Holy Ghost was rending the
   unity of the Church, without which there is no remission. St. Ambrose,
   something in the same way, applies the text to the Arians, as dividing
   the Holy Trinity, de Fide, i, 1.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   31. There came then His brethren, and His mother, and, standing
   without, sent unto Him, calling Him.

   32. And the multitude sat about Him, and they said unto Him, "Behold,
   thy mother and thy brethren without seek for Thee."

   33. And He answered them, saying, "Who is My mother, or My brethren?"

   34. And He looked round about on them which sat about Him, and said,
   "Behold My mother and My brethren!"

   35. For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is My brother, and
   My sister, and mother.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: Because the relations of the Lord had come to seize upon
   Him, as if beside Himself, His mother, urged by the sympathy of her
   love, came to Him.

   Wherefore it is said, "And there came unto Him His mother, and,
   standing without, sent unto Him, calling Him."

   Chrys.: From this it is manifest that His brethren and His mother were
   not always with Him; but because He was beloved by them, they come from
   reverence and affection, waiting without.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And the multitude sat about Him, &c."

   Bede: The brother of the Lord must not be thought to be the sons of the
   ever-virgin Mary, as Helvidius says [ed. note: The perpetual virginity
   of the Mother of God is reckoned by White, Bramhall, Patrick and
   Pearson, amongst the traditions which have ever been held in the
   Catholic Church. For an account of the heretics who denied it, see Bp.
   Pearson on the Creed, Art, 3, p. 272, note x., also Catena Aurea in
   Matt., p 58, note c], nor the sons of Joseph by a former marriage, as
   some think, but rather they must be understood to be His relations.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But another Evangelist says,
   that His brethren did not believe on Him. [John 7:5] With which this
   agrees, which says, that they sought Him, waiting without, and with
   this meaning the Lord does not mention them as relations.

   Wherefore it follows, "And He answered them, saying, Who is My mother
   or My brethren?"

   But He does not here mention His mother and His brethren altogether
   with reproof, but to shew that a man must honour his own soul above all
   earthly kindred; wherefore this is fitly said to those who called Him
   to speak with His mother and relations, as if it were a more useful
   task than the teaching of salvation.

   Bede; see Ambr. in Luc. 6, 36: Being asked therefore by a message to go
   out, He declines, not as though He refused the dutiful service of His
   mother, but to shew that He owes more to His Father's mysteries than to
   His mother's feelings. Nor does He rudely despise His brothers, but,
   preferring His spiritual work to fleshly relationship, He teaches us
   that religion is the bond of the heart rather than that of the body.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And looking round about on them which sat about
   Him, He said, Behold My mother and My brethren."

   Chrys.: By this, the Lord shews that we should honour those who are
   relations by faith rather than those who are relations by blood. A man
   indeed is made the mother of Jesus by preaching Him [ed. note: Nearly
   the same idea occurs in St. Ambrose, in Luc. 2, 8]; for He, as it were,
   brings forth the Lord, when he pours Him into the heart of his hearers.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But let us be assured that we are His brethren and His
   sisters, if we do the will of the Father; that we may be joint-heirs
   with Him, for He discerns us not by sex but by our deeds.

   Wherefore it goes on: "Whosoever shall do the will of God, &c."

   Theophylact: He does not therefore say this, as denying His mother, but
   as shewing that He is worthy of honour, not only because she bore
   Christ, but on account of her possessing every other virtue.

   Bede: By mystically, the mother and brother of Jesus means the
   synagogue, (from which according to the flesh He sprung,) and the
   Jewish people who, while the Saviour is teaching within, come to Him,
   and are not able to enter, because they cannot understand spiritual
   things.

   But the crowd eagerly enter, because when the Jews delayed, the
   Gentiles flocked to Christ; but His kindred, who stand without wishing
   to see the Lord, are the Jews who obstinately remained without,
   guarding the letter, and would rather compel the Lord to go forth to
   them to teach carnal things, than consent to enter in to learn
   spiritual things of Him.

   If therefore not even His parents when standing without are
   acknowledged, how shall we be acknowledged, if we stand without? [ed.
   note: see Ambr. in Luc., 6, 37] For the word is within and the light
   within.

Chapter 4

   1. And Jesus began to teach again by the sea-side: and there was
   gathered unto Him a great multitude, so that He entered into a ship,
   and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.

   2. And He taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in
   His doctrine:

   3: "Hearken: Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

   4. And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the
   fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

   5. And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and
   immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:

   6. But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no
   root, it withered away.

   7. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it,
   and it yielded no fruit.

   8. And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up
   and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some
   an hundred."

   9. And He said unto them, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."

   10. And when He was alone, they that were about Him with the twelve
   asked of Him the parable.

   11. And He said unto them, "Unto you it is given to know the mystery of
   the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things
   are done in parables:

   12. That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may
   hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted,
   and their sins should be forgiven them."

   13. And He said unto them, "Know ye not this parable? and how then will
   ye know all parables?

   14. The sower soweth the word.

   15. And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but
   when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the
   word that was sown in their hearts.

   16. And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,
   when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;

   17. And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
   afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake,
   immediately they are offended.

   18. And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the
   word,

   19. And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and
   the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh
   unfruitful.

   20. And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the
   word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty-fold, some
   sixty, and some an hundred."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: Although the Lord appears in the transactions mentioned
   above to neglect His mother, nevertheless He honours her; since on her
   account He goes forth about the borders of the sea.

   Wherefore it is said, "And Jesus began to teach again by the sea-side,
   &c.

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 18: For if we look into the Gospel of Matthew, it
   appears that this same teaching of the Lord at the sea, was delivered
   on the same day as the former. For after the conclusion of the first
   sermon, Matthew immediately subjoins, saying, "The same day went Jesus
   out of the house, and sat by the sea-side."

   Pseudo-Jerome: But He began to teach at the sea, that the place of His
   teaching might point out the bitter feelings and instability of His
   hearers.

   Bede: After leaving the house also, He began to teach at the sea,
   because, quitting the synagogue, He came to gather together the
   multitude of the Gentile people by the Apostles.

   Wherefore it continues: "And there was gathered unto Him a great
   multitude, so that He entered into a ship, and sat in the sea."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 44: Which we must understand was not done
   without a purpose, but that He might not leave any one behind Him, but
   have all His hearers before His face.

   Bede: Now this ship shewed in a figure the Church, to be built in the
   midst of the nations, in which the Lord consecrates for Himself a
   beloved dwelling-place.

   It goes on: "And He taught them many things by parables."

   Pseudo-Jerome: A parable is a comparison made between things discordant
   by nature, under some similitude. For parable is the Greek for a
   similitude, when we point out by some comparisons what we would have
   understood. In this way we say an iron man, when we desire that he
   should be understood to be hardy and strong; when to be swift, we
   compare him to winds and birds. But He speaks to the multitudes in
   parables, with His usual providence, that those who could not take in
   heavenly things, might conceive what they heard by an earthly
   similitude.

   Chrys.: For He rouses the minds of His hearers by a parable, pointing
   out objects to the sight, to make His discourse more manifest.

   Theophylact: And in order to rouse the attention of those who heard,
   the first parable that He proposes is concerning the seed, which is the
   word of God.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And He said to them in His doctrine."

   Not in that of Moses, nor of the Prophets, because He preaches His own
   Gospel.

   "Hearken: behold, there went out a sower to sow."

   Now the Sower is Christ.

   Chrys.: Not that He went out in space, Who is present in all space, and
   fills all, but in the form and economy by which He is made more near to
   us through the clothing of flesh. For since we were not able to go to
   Him, because sins impeded our path, He went out to us. But He went out,
   preaching in order to sow the word of piety, which He spake abundantly.
   Now He does not needlessly repeat the same word, when He says, "A sower
   went out to sow," for sometimes a sower goes out that he may break up
   land for tillage, or to pull up weeds, or for some other work. But this
   one went out to sow.

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 19: Or else, He went out to sow, when after calling
   to His faith the elect portion of the synagogue, He poured out the
   gifts of His grace in order to call the Gentiles also.

   Chrys.: Further, as a sower does not make a distinction in the ground
   which is beneath him, but simply and without distinction puts in the
   seed, so also He Himself addresses all. And to signify this, He says,
   "And as he sowed, some fell by the way-side."

   Theophylact: Take notice, that He says not that He threw it in the way,
   but that it fell, for a sower, as far as he can, throws it into good
   ground, but if the ground be bad, it corrupts the seed. Now the way is
   Christ; but infidels are by the way-side, that is, out of Christ.

   Bede: Or else, the way is a mind which is a path for bad thoughts,
   preventing the seed of the word from growing in it. And therefore
   whatsoever good seed comes in contact with such a way, perishes, and is
   carried off by devils.

   Wherefore there follows, "And the fowls of the air came and devoured it
   up."

   And well are the devils called fowls of the air, either because they
   are of a heavenly and spiritual origin, or because they dwell in the
   air.

   Or else, those who are about the way are negligent and slothful men.

   It goes on: "And some fell on stony ground."

   He calls stone, the hardness of a wanton mind; He calls ground, the
   inconstancy of a soul in its obedience; and sun, the heat of a raging
   persecution.

   Therefore the depth of earth, which ought to have received the seed of
   God, is the honesty of a mind trained in heavenly discipline, and
   regularly brought up in obedience to the Divine words. But the stony
   places, which have no strength for fixing the root firmly, are those
   breasts which are delighted only with the sweetness of the word which
   they hear, and for a time with the heavenly promises, but in a season
   of temptation fall away, for there is too little of healthful desire in
   them to conceive the seed of life.

   Theophylact: Or, the stony persons are those who adhering a little to
   the rock, that is, to Christ, up to a short time, receive the word, and
   afterwards, falling back, cast it away.

   It goes on: "And some fell among thorns;" by which are marked souls
   which care for many things. For thorns are cares.

   Chrys.: But further He mentions good ground, saying, "And other fell on
   good ground." For the difference of the fruits follows the quality of
   the ground. But great is the love of the Sower for men, for the first
   He commends, and rejects not the second, and gives a place to the
   third.

   Theophylact: See also how the bad are the greatest number, and the few
   are those who are saved, for the fourth part of the ground is found to
   be saved.

   Chrys.: This, however, the greater portion of the seed is not lost
   through the fault of the owner, but of the earth, which received it,
   that is, of the soul, which hears. And indeed the real husbandman, if
   he sowed in this way, would be rightly blamed; for he is not ignorant
   that rock, or the road, or thorny ground, cannot become fertile. But in
   spiritual things it is not so; for there it is possible that stony
   ground may become fertile; and that the road should not be trodden
   down, and that the thorns may be destroyed, for if this could not take
   place, he would not have sown there. By this, therefore, He gives to us
   hope of repentance.

   It goes on, "And He said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him
   hear."

   Bede: As often as this is inserted in the Gospel or in the Apocalypse
   of John, that which is spoken is mystical, and is pointed out as
   healthful to be heard and learnt. For the ears by which they are heard
   belong to the heart, and the ears by which men obey and do what is
   commanded are those of an interior sense.

   There follows, "And when He was alone, the twelve that were with Him
   asked of Him the parable; and He said unto them, Unto you it is given
   to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to them that are without
   all things are done in parables."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: As if He said unto them, You
   that are worthy to be taught all things which are fitted for teaching,
   shall learn the manifestation of parables; but I use parables with them
   who are unworthy to learn, because of their wickedness. For it was
   right that they who did not hold fast their obedience to that law which
   they had received, should not have any share in a new teaching, but
   should be estranged from both; for He shewed by the obedience of His
   disciples, that, on the other hand, the others were become unworthy of
   mystical doctrine. But afterwards, by bringing in a voice from
   prophecy, He confounds their wickedness, as having been long before
   reproved.

   Wherefore it goes on, "that seeing they might see, and not perceive,
   &c." [see Isa 6:9] as if He said that they prophecy might be fulfilled
   which foretells these things.

   Theophylact: For it was God Who made them to see, that is, to
   understand what is good. But they themselves see not, of their own will
   making themselves not to see, lest they should be converted and correct
   themselves, as if they were displeased at their own salvation.

   It goes on, "Lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins
   be forgiven them."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Thus, therefore, they see
   and they do not see, they hear and do not understand, for their seeing
   and hearing comes to them from God's grace, but their seeing and not
   understanding comes to them from their unwillingness to receive grace,
   and closing their eyes, and pretending that they could not see; neither
   do they acquiesce in what was said, and so are not changed as to their
   sins by hearing and seeing, but rather are made worse.

   Theophylact: Or we may understand in a different way His speaking to
   the rest in parables, that seeing they might not perceive, and hearing,
   not understand. For God gives sight and understanding to men who seek
   for them, but the rest He blinds, lest it become a greater accusation
   against them, that though they understood, they did not choose to do
   what they ought.

   Wherefore it goes on, "Lest at any times they should be, &c."

   Augustine, Quaest, 14, in Matt.: Or else they deserved this, their not
   understanding, and yet this in itself was done in mercy to them, that
   they might know their sins, and, being converted, merit pardon.

   Bede: To those then who are without, all things are done in parables,
   that is, both the actions and the words of the Saviour, because neither
   in those miracles which He was working, nor in those mysteries which He
   preached, were they able to acknowledge Him as God. Therefore they are
   not able to attain to the remission of their sins.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But His speaking to them
   only in parables, and yet not leaving off speaking to them entirely,
   shews that to those who are placed near to what is good, though they
   may have no good in themselves, still good is shewn disguised.

   But when a man approaches it with reverence and a right heart, he wins
   for himself an abundant revelation of mysteries; when on the contrary
   his thoughts are not sound, he will be neither made worthy of those
   things which are easy to many men, nor even of hearing them.

   There follows, "And He said unto them, Know ye not this parable, how
   then shall ye know all parables?"

   Pseudo-Jerome: For it was necessary that they to whom He spoke in
   parables should ask for what they did not understand, and learn by the
   Apostle whom they despised, the mystery of the kingdom which they
   themselves had not.

   Gloss.: And for this reason, the Lord in saying these things, shews
   that they ought to understand both this first, and all following
   miracles.

   Wherefore explaining it, He goes on, "The sower soweth the word."

   Chrys., in Matt., Hom. 44: And indeed the prophet has compared the
   teaching of the people to the planting of a vine; [Isa 5] in this place
   however it is compared to sowing, to shew that obedience is now shorter
   and more easy, and will sooner yield fruit.

   Bede: But in this exposition of the Lord there is embraced the whole
   range of those who might hear the words of truth, but are unable to
   attain to salvation. For there are some to whom no faith, no intellect,
   nay no opportunity of trying its usefulness, can give a perception of
   the word which they hear; of whom He says, "And these are by the
   wayside." For unclean spirits take away at once the word committed to
   their hearts, as birds carry away the seed of the trodden way. There
   are some who both experience its usefulness and feel a desire for it,
   but some of them the calamities of this world frighten, and others its
   prosperity allures, so that they do not attain to that which they
   approve. Of the first of whom He says, "And these are they who fell on
   stony ground;" of the latter, "And these are they which are sown among
   thorns." But riches are called thorns, because they tear the soul with
   the piercing of its own thoughts, and after bringing it to sin, they,
   as one may say, make it bleed by inflicting a wound.

   Again He says, "And the toil of this world, and the deceitfulness of
   riches;" for the man who is deceived by an empty desire of riches must
   soon be afflicted by the toils of continual cares.

   He adds, "And the lusts of other things;" because, whosoever despises
   the commandments of God, and wanders away lustfully seeking other
   things, is unable to attain to the joy of beatitude. And concupiscences
   of this sort choke the word, because they do not allow a good desire to
   enter into the heart, and, as it were, stifle the entrance of vital
   breath.

   There are, however, excepted from these different classes of men, the
   Gentiles who do not even have grace to hear the words of life.

   Theophylact: Further, of those who receive the seed as they ought there
   are three degrees.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And these are they who are sown on good ground."

   Those who bear fruit an hundred-fold are those who lead a perfect and
   an obedient life, as virgins and hermits. Those who bear fruit
   sixty-fold are those who are in the mean as continent persons [ed.
   note: The word translated continentes . . . means ascetics, who mix in
   the affairs of the world; whereas hermits lived quite out of them, and
   gave themselves up to contemplation; caenobites came between the two,
   living together in convents, and combined both the practical and
   contemplative life, see Greg. Naz. Or. 43, 62] and those who are living
   in convents.

   Those who bear thirty-fold are those who though weak indeed, bear fruit
   according to their own virtue, as laymen and married persons.

   Bede: Or he bears thirty-fold, who instills into the minds of the elect
   faith in the Holy Trinity; sixty-fold, who teaches the perfection of
   good works; a hundred-fold, who shews the rewards of the heavenly
   kingdom.

   For in counting a hundred, we pass on to the right hand [ed. note: "He
   alludes to the mode of counting among the ancients. All numbers were
   signified by fingers of the left hand, either straight or variously
   bent, up to a hundred; and then they changed to the right. Consult
   Caelius Rhodiginus, Lectionum Antiq. lib. 23, cap. 11, 12." Benedictine
   note on Greg. Hom. in Ezec. lib. 2, Hom., 5]; therefore that number is
   fitly made to signify everlasting happiness.

   But the good ground is the conscience of the elect, which does the
   contrary to all the former three, which both receives with willingness
   the seed of the word committed to it, and keeps it when received up to
   the season of fruit.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else the fruits of the earth are contained in thirty,
   sixty, or a hundred-fold, that is, in the Law, the Prophets, and the
   Gospel.

   21. And He said unto them, "Is a candle brought to be put under a
   bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?

   22. For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither
   was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.

   23. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."

   24. And He saith unto them, "Take heed what ye hear: with what measure
   ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more
   be given.

   25. For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from
   him shall be taken even that which he hath."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chrys.: After the question of the disciples concerning the parable, and
   its explanation, He well subjoins, "And He said unto them, Is a candle
   brought, &c." As if He said, A parable is given, not that it should
   remain obscure, and hidden as if under a bed or a bushel, but that it
   should be manifested to those who are worthy. The candle within us is
   that of our intellectual nature, and it shines either clearly or
   obscurely according to the proportion of our illumination. For if
   meditations which feed the light, and the recollection with which such
   a light is kindled, are neglected, it is presently extinguished.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else the candle is the discourse concerning the three
   sorts of seed. The bushel or the bed is the hearing of the disobedient.
   The Apostles are the candlestick, whom the word of the Lord hath
   enlightened.

   Wherefore it goes on, "For there is nothing hidden, &c."

   The hidden and secret thing is the parable of the seed, which comes
   forth to light, when it is spoken of by the Lord.

   Theophylact: Or else the Lord warns His disciples to be as light, in
   their life and conversation; as if He said, As a candle is put so as to
   give light, so all will look to your life. Therefore be diligent to
   lead a good life; sit not in corners, but be ye a candle. For a candle
   gives light, not when placed under a bed, but on a candlestick; this
   light indeed must be placed on a candlestick, that is, on the eminence
   of a godly life, that it may be able to give light to others. Not under
   a bushel, that is, in things pertaining to the palate, nor under a bed,
   that is, in idleness. For no one who seeks after the delights of his
   palate and loves rest can be a light shining over all.

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 20: Or, because the time of our life is contained
   under a certain measurement of Divine Providence, it is rightly
   compared to a bushel. But the bed of the soul is the body, in which it
   dwells and reposes for a time. He therefore who hides the word of God
   under the love of this transitory life, and of carnal allurements,
   covers his candle with a bushel or a bed.

   But he puts his light on a candlestick who employs his body in the
   ministry of the word of God; therefore under these words He typically
   teaches them a figure of preaching.

   Wherefore it goes on, "For there is nothing hidden, which shall not be
   revealed, nor is there any thing made secret, which shall not come
   abroad."

   As if He said, Be not ashamed of the Gospel, but amidst the darkness of
   persecution raise the light of the word of God upon the candlestick of
   your body, keeping fixedly in your mind that day, when the Lord will
   throw light upon the hidden places of darkness, for then everlasting
   praise awaits you, and everlasting punishment your adversaries.

   Chrys., in Matt., Hom. 15: Or else, "There is nothing hid;" as if He
   said, If ye conduct your life with care, accusation will not be able to
   obscure your light.

   Theophylact: For each of us, whether he have done good or evil, is
   brought to light in this life, much more in that which is to come. For
   what can be more hidden than God, nevertheless He Himself is manifested
   in the flesh.

   It continues, "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."

   Bede: That is, if any man have a sense for understanding the word of
   God, let him not withdraw himself, let him not turn his ear to fables,
   but let him lend his ear to search those things which truth hath
   spoken, his hands for fulfilling them, his tongue for preaching them.

   There follows, "And He said unto them, Take heed what ye hear."

   Theophylact: That is, that none of those things which are said to you
   by me should escape you.

   "With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you," that is,
   whatsoever degree of application ye bring, in that degree ye will
   receive profit.

   Bede: Or else, If ye diligently endeavor to do all the good which ye
   can, and to teach it to your neighbours, the mercy of God will come in,
   to give you both in the present life a sense to take in higher things,
   and a will to do better things, and will add for the future an
   everlasting reward. And therefore it is subjoined, "And to you shall
   more be given."

   Pseudo-Jerome: According to the measure of his faith the understanding
   of mysteries is divided to every man, and the virtues of knowledge will
   also be added to them.

   It goes on: "For he that hath, to him shall be given;" that is, he who
   hath faith shall have virtue, and he who hath obedience to the word,
   shall also have the understanding of the mystery. Again, he who, on the
   other hand, has not faith, fails in virtue; and he who has not
   obedience to the word, shall not have the understanding of it; and if
   he does not understand, he might as well not have heard.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else, He who has the
   desire and wish to hear and to seek, to him shall be given. But he who
   has not the desire of hearing divine things, even what he happens to
   have of the written law is taken from him.

   Bede: For sometimes a clever reader by neglecting his mind, deprives
   himself of wisdom, of which he tastes the sweetness, who, though slow
   in intellect, works more diligently.

   Chrys.: Again it may be said, that he "hath not," who has not truth.
   But our Lord says that "he hath," because he has a lie, for every one
   whose understanding believes a lie, thinks that he has something.

   26. And He said, "So is the kingdom of god, as if a man should cast
   seed into the ground;

   27. And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should
   spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

   28. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade,
   then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

   29. But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the
   sickle, because the harvest is come."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: A parable occurred, a little
   above, about the three seeds which perished in various ways, and the
   one which was saved; in which last He also shews three differences,
   according to the proportion of faith and practice.

   Here, however, He puts forth a parable concerning those only who are
   saved.

   Wherefore it is said, "And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a
   man should cast seed into the ground, &c."

   Pseudo-Jerome: The kingdom of God is the Church, which is ruled by God,
   and herself rules over men, and treads down the powers which are
   contrary to her, and all wickedness.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else He calls by the name
   of kingdom of God, faith in Him, and in the economy of His Incarnation;
   which kingdom indeed is as if a man should throw seed. For He Himself
   being God and the Son of God, having without change been made man, has
   cast seed upon the earth, that is, He has enlightened the whole world
   by the word of divine knowledge.

   Pseudo-Jerome: For the seed is the word of life, the ground is the
   human heart, and the sleep of the man means the death of the Saviour.
   The seed springs up night and day, because after the sleep of Christ,
   the number of Christians, through calamity and prosperity, continued to
   flourish more and more in faith, and to wax greater in deed.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or Christ Himself is the man
   who rises, for He sat waiting with patience, that they who received
   seed should bear fruit. He rises, that is, by the word of His love, He
   makes us grow to the bringing forth fruit, by the armour of
   righteousness on the right hand, [2 Cor 6:7] by which is meant the day,
   and on the left, by which is meant the night of persecution; for by
   these the seed springs up, and does not wither.

   Theophylact: Or else Christ sleeps, that is, ascends into heaven,
   where, though He seem to sleep, yet He rises by night, when through
   temptations He raises us up to the knowledge of Himself; and in the day
   time, when on account of our prayers, He sets in order our salvation.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But when He says, "He knoweth not how," He is speaking
   in a figure; that is, He does not make known to us, who amongst us will
   produce fruit unto the end.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else He says, "He knoweth
   not," that He may shew the free-will of those who receive the word, for
   He commits a work to our will, and does not work the whole Himself
   alone, lest the good should seem involuntary. For the earth brings
   forth fruits of its own accord, that is, she is brought to bear fruit
   without being compelled by a necessity contrary to her will. "First the
   blade."

   Pseudo-Jerome: That is, fear. For "the fear of God is the beginning of
   wisdom. Then the full corn in the ear;" [Ps 111:10] that is, charity,
   for charity is the fulfilling of the Law. [see Rom 13:8]

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Cat. e Cat. in Marc.: Or, first it produces the
   blade, in the law of nature, by degrees growing up to advancement;
   afterwards it brings forth the ears, which are to be collected into a
   bundle, and to be offered on an altar to the Lord, that is, in the law
   of Moses; afterwards the full-fruit, in the Gospel.

   Or because we must not only put forth leaves by obedience, but also
   learn prudence, and, like the stalk of corn, remain upright without
   minding the winds which blow us about. We must also take heed to our
   soul by a diligent recollection, that, like the ears, we may bear
   fruit, that is, shew forth the perfect operation of virtue.

   Theophylact: for we put forth the blade when we shew a principle of
   good; then the ear, when we can resist temptations; then comes the
   fruit, when a man works something perfect.

   It goes on: "and when it has brought forth the fruit, immediately he
   sendeth the sickle, because the harvest is come."

   Pseudo-Jerome: The sickle is death or the judgment, which cuts down all
   things; the harvest is the end of the world.

   Gregory, in Ezech, 2, Hom. 3: Or else, Man casts seed into the ground,
   when he places a good intention in his heart; and he sleeps, when he
   already rests in the hope which attends on a good work. But he rises
   night and day, because he advances amidst prosperity and adversity,
   though he knows it not, for he is as yet unable to measure his
   increase, and yet virtue, once conceived, goes on increasing.

   When therefore we conceive good desires, we put seed into the ground;
   when we begin to work rightly, we are the blade. When we increase to
   the perfection of good works, we arrive at the ear; when we are firmly
   fixed in the perfection of the same working, we already put forth the
   full corn in the ear.
     __________________________________________________________________

   30. And He said, "Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with
   what comparison shall we compare it?

   31. It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the
   earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:

   32. But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all
   herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air
   may lodge under the shadow of it."

   33. And with many such parable spake He the word unto them, as they
   were able to hear it.

   34. But without a parable spake He not unto them: and when they were
   alone, He expounded all things to His disciples.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: After having narrated the parable concerning the coming forth
   of the fruit from the seed of the Gospel, he here subjoins another
   parable, to shew the excellence of the doctrine of the Gospel before
   all other doctrines.

   Wherefore it is said, "And He said, Whereunto shall we liken the
   kingdom of God?"

   Theophylact: Most brief indeed is the word of faith; Believe in God,
   and thou shalt be saved. But the preaching of it has been spread far
   and wide over the earth, and increased so, that the birds of heaven,
   that is, contemplative men, sublime in understanding and knowledge,
   dwell under it. For how many wise men among the Gentiles, quitting
   their wisdom, have found rest in the preaching of the Gospel! Its
   preaching then is greater than all.

   Chrys.: And also because the wisdom spoken amongst the perfect expands,
   to an extent greater than all other sayings, that which was told to men
   in short discourses, for there is nothing greater than this truth.

   Theophylact: Again, it put forth great boughs, for the Apostles were
   divided off as the boughs of a tree, some to Rome, some to India, some
   to other parts of the world.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, that seed is very small in fear, but great when
   it has grown into charity, which is greater than all herbs: for "God is
   love," [1 John 4:16] whilst "all flesh is grass." [Isa 40:6] But the
   boughs which it puts forth are those of mercy and compassion, since
   under its shade the poor of Christ, who are meant by the living
   creatures of the heavens, delight to dwell.

   Bede: Again, the man who sows is by many taken to mean the Saviour
   Himself, by others, man himself sowing in his own heart.

   Chrys.: Then after this, Mark, who delights in brevity, to shew the
   nature of the parables, subjoins, "And with many such parables spake He
   the word unto them as they could hear Him."

   Theophylact: For since the multitude was unlearned, He instructs them
   from objects of food and familiar names, and for this reason he adds,
   "But without a parable spake He not unto them," that is, in order that
   they might be induced to approach and to ask Him.

   It goes on, "And when they were alone, He expounded all things to His
   disciples," that is, all things about which they were ignorant and
   asked Him, not simply all, whether obscure or not.

   Pseudo-Jerome: For they were worthy to hear mysteries apart, in the
   most secret haunt of wisdom, for they were men, who, removed from the
   crowds of evil thoughts, remained in the solitude of virtue; and wisdom
   is received in a time of quiet.
     __________________________________________________________________

   35. And the same day, when the even was come, He saith unto them, "Let
   us pass over unto the other side."

   36. And when they had sent away the multitude, they took Him even as He
   was in the ship. And there were also with Him other little ships.

   37. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the
   ship, so that it was now full.

   38. And He was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and
   they awake Him, and say unto Him, "Master, carest thou not that we
   perish?"

   39. And He arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, "Peace,
   be still." And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

   40. And He said unto them, "Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye
   have no faith?"

   41. And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, "What manner
   of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: After His teaching, they come from that place to the
   sea, and are tossed by the waves.

   Wherefore it is said, "And the same day, when the even was come, &c."

   Remig.: For the Lord is said to have had three places of refuge,
   namely, the ship, the mountain, and the desert. As often as He was
   pressed upon by the multitude, He used to fly to one of these. When
   therefore the Lord saw many crowds about Him, as man, He wished to
   avoid their importunity, and ordered His disciples to go over to the
   other side.

   There follows: "And sending away the multitudes, they took Him, &c."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt. 28: The Lord took the disciples indeed, that they
   might be spectators of the miracle which was coming, but He took them
   alone, that no others might see that they were of such little faith.

   Wherefore, to shew that others went across separately, it is said, "And
   there were also with Him other ships."

   Lest again the disciples might be proud of being alone taken, He
   permits them to be in danger; and besides this, in order that they
   might learn to bear temptations manfully.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And there arose a great storm of wind;" and that
   He might impress upon them a greater sense of the miracle which was to
   be done, He gives time for their fear, by sleeping.

   Wherefore there follows, "And He was Himself in the hinder part of the
   ship, &c."

   For if He had been awake, they would either not have feared, not have
   asked Him to save them when the storm arose, or they would not have
   thought that He could do any such things.

   Theophylact: Therefore He allowed them to fall into the fear of danger,
   that they might experience His power in themselves, who saw others
   benefitted by Him. But He was sleeping upon the pillow of the ship,
   that is, on a wooden one.

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt. 28: Shewing His humility, and thus teaching us
   many lessons of wisdom. But not yet did the disciples who remained
   about Him know His glory; they thought indeed that if He arose He could
   command the winds, but could by no means do so reposing or asleep.

   And therefore there follows, "And they awake Him, and say unto Him,
   "Master, carest thou not that we perish?"

   Theophylact: But He arising, rebukes first the wind, which was raising
   the tempest of the sea, and causing the waves to swell, and this is
   expressed in what follows, "And He arose, and rebuked the wind;" then
   He commands the sea.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And He said to the sea, Peace, be still."

   Gloss.: For from the troubling of the sea there arises a certain sound,
   which appears to be its voice threatening danger, and therefore, by a
   sort of metaphor, He fitly commands tranquility by a word signifying
   silence: just as in the restraining of the winds, which trouble the sea
   with their violence, He uses a rebuke.

   For men who are in power are accustomed to curb those, who rudely
   disturb the peace of mankind, by threatening to punish them; by this,
   therefore, we are given to understand, that, as a king can repress
   violent men by threats, and by his edicts sooth the murmurs of his
   people, so Christ, the King of all creatures, by His threats restrained
   the violence of the winds, and compelled the sea to be silent.

   And immediately the effect followed, for it continues, "And the wind
   ceased," when He had threatened, "and there arose a great calm," that
   is, in the sea, to which He had commanded silence.

   Theophylact: He rebuked His disciples for not having faith; for it goes
   on, "And He said unto them, Why are ye so fearful?" How is it that ye
   have not faith? For if they had faith, they would have believed that
   even when sleeping, He could preserve them safe.

   There follows, "And they feared with a great fear, and said one to
   another, &c."

   For they were in doubt about Him, for since He stilled the sea, not
   with a rod like Moses, nor with prayers as Elisha at the Jordan, nor
   with the ark as Joshua, the son of Nun, on this account they thought
   Him truly God, but since He was asleep, they thought Him a man.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mystically, however, the hinder part of the ship is the
   beginning of the Church, in which the Lord sleeps in the body only, for
   He never sleepeth who keepeth Israel; for the ship with its skins of
   dead animals keeps in the living, and keeps out the waves, and is bound
   together by wood, that is, by the cross and the death of the Lord the
   Church is saved.

   The pillow is the body of the Lord, on which His Divinity, which is as
   His head, has come down.

   But the wind and the sea are devils and persecutors, to whom He says
   Peace, when He restrains the edicts of impious kings, as He will.

   The great calm is the peace of the Church after oppression, or a
   contemplative after an active life.

   Bede: Or else the ship into which He embarked, is taken to mean the
   tree of His passion, by which the faithful attain to the security of
   the safe shore. The other ships which are said to have been with the
   Lord signify those who are imbued with faith in the cross of Christ,
   and are not beaten about by the whirlwind of tribulation; or who, after
   the storms of temptation, are enjoying the serenity of peace.

   And whilst His disciples are sailing on, Christ is asleep, because the
   time of our Lord's Passion came on His faithful ones when they were
   meditating on the rest of His future reign.

   Wherefore it is related, that it took place late, that not only the
   sleep of our Lord, but the hour itself of departing light might signify
   the setting of the true Sun.

   Again, when He ascended the cross, of which the stern of the ship was a
   type, His blaspheming persecutors rose like the waves against Him,
   driven on by the storms of the devils, by which, however, His own
   patience is not disturbed, but His foolish disciples are stuck with
   amazement. The disciples awake the Lord, because they sought, with most
   earnest wishes, the resurrection of Him whom they had seen die. Rising
   up, He threatened the wind, because when He had triumphed in His
   resurrection, He prostrated the pride of the devil.

   He ordered the sea to be still, that is, in rising again, He cast down
   the rage of the Jews. The disciples are blamed, because after His
   resurrection, He chided them for their unbelief. And we also when being
   marked with the sign of the Lord's cross, we determine to quit the
   world, embark in the ship with Christ; we attempt to cross the sea;
   but, He goes to sleep, as we are sailing amidst the roaring of the
   waters, when amidst the strivings of our virtues, or amidst the attacks
   of evil spirits, of wicked men, or of our own thoughts, the flame of
   our love grows cold.

   Amongst storms of this sort, let us diligently strive to awake Him; He
   will soon restrain the tempest, pour down peace upon us, give us the
   harbour of salvation.

Chapter 5

   1. And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country
   of the Gadarenes.

   2. And when He was come out of the ship, immediately there met Him out
   of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,

   3. Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no,
   not with chains:

   4. Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and
   the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in
   pieces: neither could any man tame him.

   5. And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
   tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.

   6. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped Him.

   7. And cried with a loud voice, and said, "What have I to do with thee,
   Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that Thou
   torment me not."

   8. For He said unto him, "Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit."

   9. And He asked him, "What is thy name?" And he answered, saying, "My
   name is Legion: for we are many."

   10. And he besought Him much that He would not send them away out of
   the country.

   11. Now there was nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine
   feeding.

   12. And all the devils besought Him, saying, "Send us into the swine,
   that we may enter into them."

   13. And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went
   out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a
   steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were
   choked in the sea.

   14. And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in
   the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.

   15. And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the
   devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind:
   and they were afraid.

   16. And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
   possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.

   17. And they began to pray Him to depart out of their coasts.

   18. And when He was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with
   the devil prayed Him that he might be with Him.

   19. Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, "Go home to thy
   friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee,
   and hath had compassion on thee."

   20. And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things
   Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: Those who were in the ship enquired among themselves,
   "What manner of man is this?" and now it is made known Who He is by the
   testimony of His enemies. For the demoniac came up confessing that He
   was the Son of God. Proceeding to which circumstance the Evangelist
   says, "And they came over unto the other side, &c."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 21: Geraza is a noted town of Arabia, across the
   Jordan, near mount Galaad, which the tribe of Manasseh held, not far
   from the lake of Tiberias, into which the swine were precipitated.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Nevertheless the exact
   reading contains neither Gadarenes, nor Gerasines, but Gergesenes. For
   Gadara is a city of Judaea, which has no sea at all about it; and
   Geraza is a city of Arabia, having neither lake nor sea near it. And
   that the Evangelists may not be thought to have spoken so manifest a
   falsehood, well acquainted as they were with the parts around Judaea,
   Gergese, from which come the Gergesenes, was an ancient city, now
   called Tiberias, around which is situated a considerable lake. [ed.
   note: Reland seems to feel the same difficulty about Gadara as the
   author of this comment; but he reconciles it by saying that the whole
   region might have been so called from the town of Gadara in Peroea,
   though the town itself was not on the lake. Reland, Palace., v2, p774,
   also Lightfoot, Horae Hebr. in locum.]

   It continues, "And when He was come out of the ship, immediately there
   met Him, &c."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 2, 24: Though Matthew says that there were
   two, Mark and Luke mention one, that you may understand that one of
   them was a more illustrious person, concerning whose state that country
   was much afflicted.

   Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., see Chrys., Hom. in Matthew, 28: Or
   else, Mark and Luke relate what was most worthy of compassion, and for
   this reason they put down more at length what had happened to this man;
   for there follows, "no man could bind him, no, not with chains."

   They therefore simply said, a "man possessed of a devil," without
   taking heed to the number; or else, that he might shew the greater
   virtue in the Worker; for He who had cured one such, might cure many
   others. Nor is there any discrepancy shewn here, for they did not say
   that there was one alone, for then they would have contradicted
   Matthew.

   Now devils dwelt in tombs, wishing to convey a false opinion to many,
   that the souls of the dead were changed to devils.

   Greg. Nyss.: Now the assembly of the devils had prepared itself to
   resist the Divine power. But when He was approaching Who had power over
   all things, they proclaim aloud His eminent virtue.

   Wherefore there follows, "But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and
   worshipped him, saying, &c."

   Cyril: See how the devil is divided between to passions, fear and
   audacity; he hangs back and prays, as if meditating a question; he
   wishes to know what he had to do with Jesus, as though he would say,
   "Do you cast me out from men, who are mine?"

   Bede: And how great is the impiety of the Jews, to say that He cast out
   devils by the prince of the devils, when the very devils confess that
   they have nothing in common with Him.

   Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., and Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 28: Then
   praying to Him, he subjoins, "I adjure thee by God, that Thou torment
   me not." For he considered being cast out to be a torment, or else he
   was also invisibly tortured. For however bad the devils are, they know
   that there awaits them at last a punishment for their sins; but that
   the time of their last punishment was not yet come, they full well
   knew, especially as they were permitted to mix among men. But because
   Christ had come upon them as they were doing such dreadful deeds, they
   thought that such was the heinousness of their crimes, He would not
   wait for the last times, to punish them; for this reason they beg that
   they may not be tormented.

   Bede: For it is a great torment for a devil to cease to hurt a man, and
   the more severely he possesses him, the more reluctantly he lets him
   go.

   For it goes on, "For He said unto Him, Come out of the man, thou
   unclean spirit."

   Cyril: Consider the unconquerable power of Christ; He makes Satan
   shake, for to him the words of Christ are fire and flame: as the
   Psalmist says, "The mountains melted at the presence of the Lord, [Ps
   97:5] that is, great and proud powers.

   There follows, "And He asked him, What is thy name?"

   Theophylact: The Lord indeed asks, not that He Himself required to
   know, but that the rest might know that there was a multitude of devils
   dwelling in him.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Lest he should not be
   believed, if He affirmed there were many, He wishes that they
   themselves should confess it; wherefore there follows, "And he saith
   unto Him, Legion, for we are many." He gives not a fixed number, but a
   multitude, for such accuracy in the number would not help us to
   understand it.

   Bede: But by the public declaration of the scourge which the madman
   suffered the virtue of the Healer appears more gracious. And even the
   priests of our time, who know how to cast out devils by the grace of
   exorcism, are wont to say that the sufferers cannot be cured at all,
   unless they in confession openly declare, as far as they are able to
   know, what they have suffered from the unclean spirits in sight, in
   hearing, in taste, in touch, or any other sense of body or soul,
   whether awake or asleep.

   It goes on, "And he besought Him much that He would not send them away
   out of the country."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Luke, however, says, "into
   the abyss." [Luke 8:3] For the abyss is the separation of this world,
   for devils deserve to be sent into outer darkness, prepared for the
   devil and his angels. This Christ might have done, but He allowed them
   to remain in this world, lest the absence of a tempter should deprive
   men of the crown of victory.

   Theophylact: Also that by fighting with us, they may make us more
   expert.

   It goes on, "Now there was there about the mountain a great herd of
   swine feeding."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan, ii, 24: What Mark here says, that the herd was
   about the mountain, and what Luke calls on the mountain, are by no
   means inconsistent. For the herd of swine was so large, that some part
   were on the mountain, the rest around it.

   It goes on: "And the devils besought Him, saying, Send us into the
   swine, that we may enter into them."

   Remig., see Aurea Catena in Matt., p.327: The devils entered not into
   the swine of their own will, but their asking for this concession was
   that is might be shewn that they cannot hurt men without Divine
   permission. They did not ask to be sent into men, because they saw that
   He, by whose power they were tortured, bore a human form. Nor did they
   desire to be sent into the flocks, for they are clean animals offered
   up in the temple of God. But they desired to be sent into the swine,
   because no animal is more unclean than a hog, and devils always delight
   in filthiness.

   It goes on: "And forthwith Jesus gave them leave."

   Bede: And He gave them leave, that by the killing of the swine, the
   salvation of men might be furthered.

   Pseudo-Chyrs., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He wished to shew publicly
   the fury which devils entertain against men, and that they would
   inflict much worse things upon men, if they were not hindered by Divine
   power; because, again, His compassion would not allow this to be shewn
   on men, He permitted them to enter into the swine, that on them the
   fury and power of the devils might be made known.

   There follows: "And the unclean spirits went out."

   Titus: But the herdsmen also took to flight, lest they should perish
   with the swine, and spread the same fear amongst the inhabitants of the
   town.

   Wherefore there follows: "And they that fed them, &c."

   The necessity of their loss, however, brought these men to the Saviour;
   for frequently when God makes men suffer loss in their possessions, He
   confers a benefit on their souls.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And they came to Jesus, and see him that was
   tormented by the devil, &c." that is, at the feet of Him from whom he
   had obtained health; a man, whom before, not even chains could bind,
   clothed and in his right mind, though he used to be continually naked;
   and they were amazed.

   Wherefore it says, "And they were afraid."

   This miracle then they find out partly by sight, partly by words.

   Wherefore there follows: "And they that saw it told them."

   Theophylact: But amazed at the miracle, which they had heard, they were
   afraid, and for this reason they beseech Him to depart out of their
   borders; which is expressed in what follows: "And they began to pray
   Him to depart out of their coasts;" for they feared lest some time or
   other they should suffer a like thing: for, saddened at the loss of
   their swine, they reject the presence of the Saviour.

   Bede: Or else, conscious of their own frailty, they judged themselves
   unworthy of the presence of the Lord.

   It goes on: "And when He was going to the ship, he that had been
   tormented, &c."

   Theophylact: For he feared lest some time or other the devils should
   find him, and enter into him a second time. But the Lord sends him back
   to his house, intimating to him, that though He Himself was not
   present, yet His power would keep him; at the same time also that he
   might be of use in the healing of others.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He did not suffer him, and saith unto him,
   Go home to thy friends, &c."

   See the humility of the Saviour. He said not, Proclaim all things which
   I have done to you,' but, all that the Lord hath done; do thou also,
   when thou hast done any good thing, take it not to thyself, but refer
   it to God.

   Chrys.: But although He bade others, whom He healed, to tell it to no
   one, He nevertheless fitly bids this one proclaim it, since all that
   region, being possessed by devils, remained without God.

   Theophylact: He therefore began to proclaim it, and all wonder, which,
   is that which follows: "And he began to publish."

   Bede: Mystically, however, Gerasa or Gergese, as some read it, is
   interpreted casting out a dweller or a stranger approaching, because
   the people of the Gentiles both expelled the enemy from the heart, and
   he who was afar off is made near.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Here again the demoniac is the people of the Gentiles,
   in a most hopeless case, bound neither by the law of nature, nor of
   God, nor by human fear.

   Bede: Who dwelt in the tombs, because they delighted in dead works,
   that is, in sins; who were ever raging night and day, because whether
   in prosperity or in adversity, they were never free from the service of
   malignant spirits: again, by the foulness of their works, they lay as
   it were in the tombs, in their lofty pride, they wandered over the
   mountains, by words of most hardened infidelity, they as it were cut
   themselves with stones.

   But he said, "My name is Legion," because the Gentile people were
   enslaved to divers idolatrous forms of worship. Again, that the unclean
   spirits going out from man enter into swine, which they cast headlong
   into the sea, implies that now that the people of the Gentiles are
   freed from the empire of demons, they who have not chosen to believe in
   Christ, work sacrilegious rites in hidden places.

   Theophylact: Or by this it is signified that devils enter into those
   men who live like swine, rolling themselves in the slough of pleasure;
   they drive them headlong into the sea down the precipice of perdition,
   into the sea of an evil life where they are choked.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or they are choked in hell without any touch of mercy by
   the rushing on of an early death; which evils many persons thus avoid,
   for by the scourging of the fool, the wise is made more prudent.

   Bede: But that the Lord did not admit him, though he wished to be with
   Him, signifies, that every one after the remission of his sins should
   remember that he must work to obtain a good conscience, and serve the
   Gospel for the salvation of others, that at last he may rest in Christ.

   Greg., Mor., 37: For when we have perceived ever so little of the
   Divine knowledge, we are at once unwilling to return to human affairs,
   and seek for the quiet of contemplation; but the Lord commands that the
   mind should first toil hard at its work, and afterwards should refresh
   itself with contemplation.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But the man who is healed preached in Decapolis, where
   the Jews, who hang on the letter of the Decalogue, are being turned
   away from the Roman rule.
     __________________________________________________________________

   21. And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side,
   much people gathered unto Him: and He was nigh unto the sea.

   22. And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
   Jairus by name; and when he saw Him, he fell at His feet,

   23. And besought Him greatly, saying, "My little daughter lieth at the
   point of death: I pray thee, come and lay Thy hands on her, that she
   may be healed; and she shall live."

   24. And Jesus went with him; and much people followed Him, and thronged
   Him.

   25. And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,

   26. And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all
   that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,

   27. When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched
   His garment.

   28. For she said, "If I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole."

   29. And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she
   felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.

   30. And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that virtue had gone out
   of Him, turned Him about in the press, and said, "Who touched My
   clothes?"

   31. And His disciples said unto Him, "Thou seest the multitude
   thronging Thee, and saying Thou, Who touched Me?' "

   32. And He looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

   33. But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her,
   came and fell down before Him, and told Him all the truth.

   34. And He said unto her, "Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go
   in peace, and be whole of thy plague."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After the miracle of the demoniac, the Lord works another
   miracle, namely, in raising up the daughter of the ruler of the
   synagogue; the Evangelist, before narrating this miracle, says, "And
   when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much
   people gathered unto Him."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 2, 28: But we must understand, that what is
   added of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, took place when
   Jesus had again crossed the sea in a ship, though how long after does
   not appear; for if there were not an interval, there could be no time
   for the taking place of that which Matthew relates, concerning the
   feast at his own house; after which event, nothing follows immediately,
   except this concerning the daughter of the chief of the synagogue. For
   he has so put it together, that the transition itself shews that the
   narrative follows the order of time.

   It goes on, "There cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, &c."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He has recorded the name on
   account of the Jews of that time, that it might mark the miracle.

   It goes on, "And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet, and besought Him
   greatly, &c."

   Matthew indeed relates that the chief of the synagogue reported that
   his daughter was dead, but Mark says that she was very sick, and that
   afterwards it was told to the ruler of the synagogue, when our Lord was
   about to go with him, that she was dead. The fact then, which Matthew
   implies, is the same, namely, that He raised her from the dead; and it
   is for the sake of brevity, that he says that she was dead, which was
   evident from her being raised.

   Augustine: For he attaches himself not to the words of the father, but
   to what is of most importance, his wishes; for he was in such despair,
   that his wish was that she should return to life, not thinking that she
   could be found alive, whom he had left dying.

   Theophylact: Now this man was faithful in part, inasmuch as he fell at
   the feet of Jesus, but in that he begged of Him to come, he did not
   shew as much faith as he ought. For he ought to have said, Speak the
   word only, and my daughter shall be healed.'

   There follows, "And He went away with him, and much people followed
   Him, and thronged Him; and a woman, which had an issue of blood twelve
   years, &c."

   Chrys., see Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 31: This woman, who was celebrated
   and known to all, did not dare to approach the Saviour openly, nor to
   come to Him, because, according to the law, she was unclean; for this
   reason she touched Him behind, and not in front, for that she durst not
   do, but only ventured to touch the hem of His garment. It was not
   however the hem of the garment, but her frame of mind that made her
   whole.

   There follows, "For she said, "If I may but touch His clothes, I shall
   be whole."

   Theophylact: Most faithful indeed is this woman, who hoped for healing
   from His garments. For which reason she obtains health.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And straightway the fountain of her blood was
   dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Now the virtues of Christ
   are by His own will imparted to those men, who touch Him by faith.

   Wherefore there follows, "And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself
   that virtue had gone out of Him, turned Him about in the press, and
   said, Who touched My clothes?" The virtues indeed of the Saviour do not
   go out of Him locally or corporally, nor in any respect pass away from
   Him. For being incorporeal, they go forth to others and are given to
   others; they are not however separated from Him, from whom they are
   said to go forth, in the same way as sciences are given by the teacher
   to his pupils.

   Therefore it says, "Jesus, knowing in Himself the virtue which had gone
   out of Him," to shew that with His knowledge, and not without His being
   aware of it, the woman was healed. But He asked, "Who touched me?"
   although He knew her who touched Him, that He might bring to light the
   woman, by her coming forward, and proclaim her faith, and lest the
   virtue of His miraculous work should be consigned to oblivion.

   It goes on, "And His disciples said unto Him, Thou seest the multitude
   thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched Me?"

   But the Lord asked, "Who touched Me," that is in thought and faith, for
   the crowds who throng Me cannot be said to touch Me, for they do not
   come near to Me in thought and in faith.

   There follows, "And He looked round about to see her that had done this
   thing."

   Theophylact: For the Lord wished to declare the woman, first to give
   His approbation to her faith, secondly to urge the chief of the
   synagogue to a confident hope that He could thus cure his child, and
   also to free the woman from fear. For the woman feared because she had
   stolen health.

   Wherefore there follows, "But the woman fearing and trembling, &c."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 22: Observe that the object of His question was that
   the woman should confess the truth of her long want of faith, of her
   sudden belief and healing, and so herself be confirmed in faith, and
   afford an example to others.

   "But He said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in
   peace, and be whole of thy plague."

   He said not, Thy faith is about to make thee whole, but has made thee
   whole, that is, in that thou hast believed, thou hast already been made
   whole.

   Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., see Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 31: He
   calls her "daughter" because she was saved by her faith; for faith in
   Christ makes us His children.

   Theophylact: But He saith to her, "Go in peace," that is, in rest,
   which means, go and have rest, for up to this time thou hast been in
   pains and torture.

   Pseudo-Chrys.: Or else He says, "Go in peace," sending her away into
   that which is the final good, for God dwells in peace, that thou mayest
   know, that she was not only healed in body, but also from the causes of
   bodily pain, that is, from her sins.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mystically, however, Jairus comes after the healing of
   the woman, because when the fulness of the Gentiles has come in, then
   shall Israel be saved. [Romans 11] Jairus means either illuminating, or
   illuminated, that is, the Jewish people, having cast off the shadow of
   the letter, enlightened by the Spirit, and enlightening others, falling
   at the feet of the Word, that is, humbling itself before the
   Incarnation of Christ, prays for her daughter, for when a man lives
   himself, he makes others live also. Thus Abraham, and Moses, and
   Samuel, intercede for the people who are dead, and Jesus comes upon
   their prayers.

   Bede: Again, the Lord going to the child, who is to be healed, is
   thronged by the crowd, because though He gave healthful advice to the
   Jewish nation, He is oppressed by the wicked habits of that carnal
   people; but the woman with an issue of blood, cured by the Lord, is the
   Church gathered together from the nations, for the issue of blood may
   be either understood of the pollution of idolatry, or of those deeds,
   which are accompanied by pleasure to flesh and blood. But whilst the
   word of the Lord decreed salvation to Judaea, the people of the
   Gentiles by an assured hope seized upon the health, promised and
   prepared for others.

   Theophylact: Or else, by the woman, who had a bloody flux, understand
   human nature; for sin rushed in upon it, which since it killed the
   soul, might be said to spill its blood. It could not be cured by many
   physicians, that is, by the wise men of this world, and of the Law and
   the Prophets; but the moment that it touched the hem of Christ's
   garment, that is, His flesh, it was healed, for whosoever believes the
   Son of man to be Incarnate is he who touches the hem of His garment.

   Bede: Wherefore one believing woman touches the Lord, whilst the crowd
   throngs Him, because He, who is grieved by divers heresies, or by
   wicked habits, is worshipped faithfully with the heart of the Catholic
   Church alone. But the Church of the Gentiles came behind Him; because
   though it did not see the Lord present in the flesh, for the mysteries
   of His Incarnation had been gone through, yet it attained to the grace
   of His faith, and so when by partaking of His sacraments, it merited
   salvation from its sins, as it were the fountain of its blood was dried
   up by the touch of His garments. And the Lord looked round about to see
   her who had done this, because He judges that all who deserve to be
   saved are worthy of His look and of His pity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   35. While He yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's
   house certain which said, "Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the
   Master any further?"

   36. As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He saith unto the
   ruler of the synagogue, "Be not afraid, only believe."

   37. And He suffered no man to follow Him, save Peter, and James, and
   John the brother of James.

   38. And He cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth
   the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

   39. And when He was come in, He saith unto them, "Why make ye this ado,
   and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth."

   40. And they laughed Him to scorn. But when He had put them all out, He
   taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with
   Him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.

   41. And He took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, "Talitha
   cumi;" which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.

   42. And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the
   age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great
   astonishment.

   43. And He charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
   commanded that something should be given her to eat.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: Those who were about the ruler of the synagogue, thought
   that Christ was one of the prophets, and for this reason they thought
   that they should beg of Him to come and pray over the damsel. But
   because she had already expired, they thought that He ought not to be
   asked to do so.

   Therefore it is said, "While He yet spake, there came messengers to the
   ruler of the synagogue, which said, Thy daughter is dead; why troublest
   thou the Master any further?"

   But the Lord Himself persuades the father to have confidence.

   For it goes on, "As soon as Jesus heard the word which was spoken, He
   saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid; only believe."

   Augustine: It is not said that he assented to his friends who brought
   the tidings and wished to prevent the Master from coming, so that our
   Lord's saying, "Fear not, only believe," is not a rebuke for his want
   of faith, but was intended to strengthen the belief which he had
   already. But if the Evangelist had related, that the ruler of the
   synagogue joined the friends who came from his house, in saying that
   Jesus should not be troubled, the words which Matthew relates him to
   have said, namely, that the damsel was dead, would then have been
   contrary to what was in his mind.

   It goes on, "And He suffered no man to follow Him, save Peter, and
   James, and John the brother of James."

   Theophylact: For Christ in His lowliness would not do any thing for
   display.

   It goes on, "And He cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue,
   and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But He Himself commands them
   not to wail, as if the damsel was not dead, but sleeping.

   Wherefore it says, "And when He was come in, He saith unto them, Why
   make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth."

   Pseudo-Jerome: It was told the ruler of the synagogue, Thy daughter is
   dead. But Jesus said to him, She is not dead, but sleepeth. Bother are
   true, for the meaning is, She is dead to you, but to Me she is asleep.

   Bede: For to men she was dead, who were unable to raise her up; but to
   God she was asleep, in whose purpose both the soul was living, and the
   flesh was resting, to rise again. Whence it became a custom amongst
   Christians, that the dead, who, they doubt not, will rise again, should
   be said to sleep.

   It goes on, "And they laughed Him to scorn."

   Theophylact: But they laugh at Him, as if unable to do any thing
   farther; and in this He convicts them of bearing witness involuntarily,
   that she was really dead whom He raised up, and therefore, that it
   would be a miracle if He raised her.

   Bede: Because they chose rather to laugh at than to believe in this
   saying concerning her resurrection, they are deservedly excluded from
   the place, as unworthy to witness His power in raising her, and the
   mystery of her rising.

   Wherefore it goes on, "But when He had put them all out, He taketh the
   father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with Him, and
   entereth in where the damsel was lying."

   Chrys.: Or else, to take away all display, He suffered not all to be
   with Him; that, however, He might leave behind Him witnesses of His
   divine power, He chose His three chief disciples and the father and
   mother of the damsel, as being necessary above all. And He restores
   life to the damsel both by His hand, and by word of mouth.

   Wherefore it says, "And He took the damsel by the hand, and said unto
   her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto
   thee, Arise."

   For the hand of Jesus, having a quickening power, quickens the dead
   body, and His voice raises her as she is lying.

   Wherefore it follows, "And straightway the damsel arose and walked."

   Jerome, Hier. ad Pam., Ep. 57: Some one may accuse the Evangelist of a
   falsehood in his explanation, in that he had added, "I say unto thee,"
   when in Hebrew, "Talitha cumi" only means, "Damsel, arise;" but He
   adds, "I say unto thee, Arise," to express that His meaning was to call
   and command her.

   It goes on, "For she was of the age of twelve years."

   Gloss.: The Evangelist added this, to shew that she was of an age to
   walk. By her walking, she is shewn to have been not only raised up, but
   also perfectly cured.

   It continues, "And they were astonished with a great astonishment."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 81: To shew that He had raised her really, and
   not only to the eye of fancy.

   Bede: Mystically; the woman was cured of a bloody flux, and immediately
   after the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue is reported to be
   dead, because as soon as the Church of the Gentiles is washed from the
   stain of vice, and called daughter by the merits of her faith, at once
   the synagogue is broken up on account of its zealous treachery and
   envy; treachery, because it did not choose to believe in Christ; envy,
   because it was vexed at the faith of the Church.

   What the messengers told the ruler of the synagogue, "Why troublest
   thou the Master any more," is said by those in this day who, seeing the
   state of the synagogue, deserted by God, believe that it cannot be
   restored, and therefore think that we are not to pray that it should be
   restored. But if the ruler of the synagogue, that is, the assembly of
   the teachers of the Law, determine to believe, the synagogue also,
   which is subjected to them, will be saved.

   Further, because the synagogue lost the joy of having Christ to dwell
   in it, as its faithlessness deserved, it lies dead as it were, amongst
   persons weeping and wailing. Again, our Lord raised the damsel by
   taking hold of her hand, because the hands of the Jews, which are full
   of blood, must first be cleansed, else the synagogue, which is dead,
   cannot rise again. But in the woman with the bloody flux, and the
   raising of the damsel, is shewn the salvation of the human race, which
   was so ordered by the Lord, that first some from Judaea, then the
   fulness of the Gentiles, might come in, and so all Israel might be
   saved. Again, the damsel was twelve years old, and the woman had
   suffered for twelve years, because the sinning of unbelievers was
   contemporary with the beginning of the faith of believers.

   Wherefore it is said, "Abraham believed on God, and it was counted to
   him for righteousness." [Gen 15:6]

   [ed. note: Bede's own words are rather more clear than those in the
   Catena: "That is, the woman began to be afflicted at the same time as
   the damsel was born; for nearly at the same period of the world the
   synagogue began to arise amongst the patriarchs, and the race of
   Gentiles throughout the world to be polluted with idolatry."]

   Greg., Mor. 4, 27: Morally again, our Redeemer raised the damsel in the
   house, the young man without the gate, Lazarus in the tomb; he still
   lies dead in the house, whose sin is concealed; he is carried without
   the gate, whose sin has broken forth into the madness of an open deed;
   he lies crushed under the mound of the tomb, who in the commission of
   sin, lies powerless beneath the weight of habit.

   Bede: And we may remark, that lighter and daily errors may be cured by
   the remedy of a lighter penance. Wherefore the Lord raises the damsel,
   lying in the inner chamber with a very easy cry, saying, "Damsel,
   arise;" but that he who had been four days dead might quit the prison
   of the tomb, He groaned in spirit, He was troubled, He shed tears. In
   proportion, then, as the death of the soul presses the more heavily, so
   much the more ardently must the fervour of the penitent press forward.

   But this too must be observed, that a public crime requires a public
   reparation; wherefore Lazarus, when called from the sepulchre, was
   placed before the eyes of the people: but slight sins require to be
   washed out by a secret penance, wherefore the damsel lying in the house
   is raised up before few witnesses, and those are desired to tell no
   man.

   The crowd also is cast out before the damsel is raised; for if a crowd
   of worldly thoughts be not first cast out from the hidden parts of the
   heart, the soul, which lies dead within, cannot rise.

   Well too did she arise and walk, for the soul, raised from sin, ought
   not only to rise from the filth of its crimes, but also to make
   advances in good works, and soon it is necessary that it should be
   filled with heavenly bread, that is, made partaker of the Divine Word,
   and of the Altar.

Chapter 6

   1. And He went out from thence, and came into His own country; and His
   disciples follow Him.

   2. And when the sabbath day was come, He began to teach in the
   synagogue: and many hearing Him were astonished, saying, "From whence
   hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto
   him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?

   3. Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James,
   and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with
   us?" And they were offended at Him.

   4. But Jesus said unto them, "A prophet is not without honour but in
   his own country, and among his own kind, and in his own house."

   5. And He could there do no mighty work, save that He laid His hands
   upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

   6. And He marvelled because of their unbelief.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After the miracles which have been related, the Lord
   returns into His own country, not that He was ignorant that they would
   despise Him, but that they might have no reason to say, If Thou hadst
   come, we had believed Thee.

   Wherefore it is said, "And He went out from thence, and came into His
   own country."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 23: He means by His country, Nazareth, in which He
   was brought up. But how great the blindness of the Nazarenes! they
   despise Him, Who by His words and deeds they might know to be the
   Christ, solely on account of His kindred.

   It goes on: "And when the sabbath day was come, He began to teach in
   the synagogue; and many hearing Him were astonished, saying, From
   whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is
   given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?"

   By wisdom is meant His doctrine, by powers, the cures and miracles
   which He did.

   It goes on: Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary?"

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 42: Matthew indeed says that He was
   called the son of a carpenter; nor are we to wonder, since both might
   have been said, for they believed Him to be a carpenter, because He was
   the son of a carpenter.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Jesus is called the son of a workman, of that one,
   however, whose work was the morning and the sun, that is, the first and
   second Church, as a figure of which the woman and the damsel are
   healed.

   Bede: For although human things are not to be compared with divine,
   still the type is complete, because the Father of Christ works by fire
   and spirit.

   It goes on: "The brother of James, and Joses, of Jude, and of Simon.
   And are not his sisters here with us?"

   They bear witness that His brothers and sisters were with Him, who
   nevertheless are not to be taken for the sons of Joseph or of Mary, as
   heretics say, but rather, as is usual in Scripture, we must understand
   them to be His relations, as Abraham and Lot are called brothers,
   though Lot was brother's son to Abraham.

   "And they were offended at Him." The stumbling and the error of the
   Jews is our salvation, and the condemnation of heretics. For so much
   did they despise the Lord Jesus Christ, as to call Him a carpenter, and
   son of a carpenter.

   It goes on: "And Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour,
   but in his own country."

   Even Moses bears witness that the Lord is called a Prophet in the
   Scripture, for predicting His future Incarnation to the sons of Israel,
   he says, "A Prophet shall the Lord raise up unto you of your brethren."
   [Acts 7:37] But not only He Himself, Who is Lord of prophets, but also
   Elias, Jeremiah, and the remaining lesser prophets, were worse received
   in their own country than in strange cities, for it is almost natural
   for men to envy their fellow-townsmen; for they do not consider the
   present works of the man, but they remember the weakness of Him
   infancy.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Oftentimes also the origin of a man brings him contempt,
   as it is written, "Who is the son of Jesse?" [1 Sam 25:10] for the Lord
   "hath respect unto the lowly; as to the proud, He beholdeth them afar
   off."

   Theophylact: Or again, if the prophet has noble relations, his
   countrymen hate them, and on that account do not honour the prophet.

   There follows, "And He could there do no mighty work, &c." What,
   however, is here expressed by He could not, we must take to mean, He
   did not choose, because it was not that He was weak, but that they were
   faithless; He does not therefore work any miracles there, for He spared
   them, lest they should be worthy of greater blame, if they believed
   not, even with miracles before their eyes.

   Or else, for the working of miracles, not only the power of the Worker
   is necessary, but the faith of the recipient, which was wanting in this
   case: therefore Jesus did not choose to work any signs there.

   There follows: "And He marvelled at their unbelief."

   Bede: Not as if He Who knows all things before they are done, wonders
   at what He did not expect or look forward to, but knowing the hidden
   things of the heart, and wishing to intimate to men that it was
   wonderful, He openly shews that He wonders. And indeed the blindness of
   the Jews is wonderful, for they neither believed what their prophets
   said of Christ, nor would in their own persons believe on Christ, Who
   was born amongst them. Mystically again; Christ is despised in His own
   house and country, that is, amongst the people of the Jews, and
   therefore He worked few miracles there, lest they should become
   altogether inexcusable. But He performs greater miracles every day
   amongst the Gentiles, not so much in the healing of their bodies, as in
   the salvation of their souls.

   6. ---- And He went round about the villages, teaching.

   7. And He called unto Him the twelve, and began to send them forth by
   two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;

   8. And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey,
   save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:

   9. But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

   10. And He said unto them, "In what place soever ye enter into an
   house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

   11. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart
   thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against
   them. Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and
   Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city."

   12. And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

   13. And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were
   sick, and healed them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: The Lord not only preached in the cities, but also in
   villages, that we may learn not to despise little things, nor always to
   seek for great cities, but to sow the word of the Lord in abandoned and
   lowly villages.

   Wherefore it is said, "And He went round about the villages, teaching."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 24: Now our kind and merciful Lord and Master did
   not grudge His servants and their disciples His own virtues, and as He
   Himself had healed every sickness and every infirmity, so also He gave
   the same power to His disciples.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He called unto Him the twelve, and began to
   send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean
   spirits."

   Great is the difference between giving and receiving. Whatsoever He
   does, is done in His own power, as Lord; if they do any thing, they
   confess their own weakness and the power of the Lord, saying in the
   name of Jesus, "Arise, and walk."

   Theophylact: Again He sends the Apostles two and two that they might
   become more active; for, as says the Preacher, "Two are better than
   one." [Eccles 4:9] But if He had sent more than two, there would not
   have been a sufficient number to allow of their being sent to many
   villages.

   Greg., Hom. in Evan., 17: Further, the Lord sent the disciples to
   preach, two and two, because there are two precepts of charity, namely,
   the love of God, and of our neighbour; and charity cannot be between
   less than two; by this therefore He implies to us, that he who has not
   charity towards his neighbour, ought in no way to take upon himself the
   office of preaching.

   There follows: "And He commanded them, that they should take nothing
   for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in
   their purse: but be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats."

   Bede: For such should be the preacher's trust in God, that, though he
   takes no thought for supplying his own wants in this present world, yet
   he should feel most certain that these will not be left unsatisfied,
   lest whilst his mind is taken up with temporal things, he should
   provide less of eternal things to others.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: The Lord also gives them
   this command, that they might shew by their mode of life, how far
   removed they were from the desire of riches.

   Theophylact: Instructing them also by this means not to be fond of
   receiving gifts, in order too that those, who saw them proclaim
   poverty, might be reconciled to it, when they saw that the Apostles
   themselves possessed nothing.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 2, 30: Or else; according to Matthew, the
   Lord immediately subjoined, "The workman is worthy of his meat," [Matt
   10:19] which sufficiently proves why He forbade their carrying or
   possessing such things; not because they were not necessary, but
   because He sent them in such a way as to shew, that they were due to
   them from the faithful, to whom they preached the Gospel.

   From this it is evident that the Lord did not mean by this precept that
   the Evangelists ought to live only on the gifts of those to whom they
   preach the Gospel, else the Apostle transgressed this precept when he
   procured his livelihood by the labour of his own hands, but He meant
   that He had given them a power, in virtue of which, they might be
   assured these things were due to them.

   It is also often asked, how it comes that Matthew and Luke have related
   that the Lord commanded His disciples not to carry even a staff, whilst
   Mark says, "And He commanded them that they should take nothing for
   their journey, save a staff only." Which question is solved, by
   supposing that the word's taff' has a meaning in Mark, who says that it
   ought to be carried, different from that which it bears in Matthew and
   Luke, who affirm the contrary. For in a concise way one might say, Take
   none of the necessaries of life with you, nay, not a staff, save a
   staff only; so that the saying, nay not a staff, may mean, nay not the
   smallest thing; but that which is added, "save a staff only," may mean
   that, through the power received by them from the Lord, of which a rod
   is the ensign, nothing, even of those things which they do not carry,
   will be wanting to them.

   The Lord, therefore, said both, but because one Evangelist has not
   given both, men suppose, that he who has said that the staff, in one
   sense, should be taken, is contrary to him who again has declared,
   that, in another sense, it should be left behind: now however that a
   reason has been given, let no one think so.

   So also when Matthew declares that shoes are not to be worn on the
   journey, he forbids anxiety about them, for the reason why men are
   anxious about carrying them, is that they may not be without them. This
   is also to be understood of the two coats, that no man should be
   troubled about having only that with which he is clad from anxiety lest
   he should need another, when he could always obtain one from the power
   given by the Lord.

   In like manner Mark, by saying that they are to be shod with sandals or
   soles, warns us that this mode of protecting the feet has a mystical
   signification, that the foot should neither be covered above nor be
   naked on the ground, that is, that the Gospel should neither be hid,
   nor rest upon earthly comforts; and in that He forbids their possessing
   or taking with them, or more expressly their wearing, two coats, He
   bids them walk simply, not with duplicity. But whosoever thinks that
   the Lord could not in the same discourse say some things figuratively,
   others in a literal sense, let him look into His other discourses, and
   he shall see, how rash and ignorant is his judgment.

   Bede: Again, by the two tunics He seems to me to mean two sets of
   clothes; not that in places like Scythia, covered with the ice and
   snow, a man should be content with only one garment, but by coat, I
   think a suit of clothing is implied, that being clad with one, we
   should not keep another through anxiety as to what may happen.

   Pseudo-Chrys.: Or else, Matthew and Luke neither allow shoes nor staff,
   which is meant to point out the highest perfection. But Mark bids them
   take a staff and be shod with sandals, which is spoken by permission.
   [see 1 Cor 7:6]

   Bede: Again, allegorically; under the figure of a scrip is pointed out
   the burdens of this world, by bread is meant temporal delights, by
   money in the purse, the hiding of wisdom; because he who receives the
   office of a doctor, should neither be weighed down by the burden of
   worldly affairs, nor be made soft by carnal desires, nor hide the
   talent of the word committed to him under the case of an inactive body.

   It goes on, "And He said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into
   an house, there abide till ye depart from that place."

   Where He gives a general precept of constancy, that they should look to
   what is due to the tie of hospitality, adding, that it is inconsistent
   with the preaching of the kingdom of heaven to run about from house to
   house.

   Theophylact: That is, lest they should be accused of gluttony in
   passing from one to another. It goes on, "And whoever shall not receive
   you, &c." This the Lord commanded them, that they might shew that they
   had walked a long way for their sakes, and to no purpose. Or, because
   they received nothing from them, not even dust, which they shake off,
   that it might be a testimony against them, that is, by way of
   convicting them.

   Pseudo-Chrys.: Or else, that it might be a witness of the toil of the
   way, which they sustained for them; or as if the dust of the sins of
   the preachers was turned against themselves.

   It goes on: "And they went and preached that men should repent. And
   they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick,
   and healed them."

   Mark alone mentions their anointing with oil. James however, in his
   canonical Epistle, says a thing similar. For oil both refreshes our
   labours, and gives us light and joy; but again, oil signifies the mercy
   of the unction of God, the healing of infirmity, and the enlightening
   of the heart, the whole of which is worked by prayer.

   Theophylact: It also means, the grace of the Holy Ghost, by which we
   are eased from our labours, and receive light and spiritual joy.

   Bede: Where it is evident from the Apostles themselves, that it is an
   ancient custom of the holy Church that persons possessed or afflicted
   with any disease whatever, should be anointed with oil consecrated by
   priestly blessing.

   14. And king Herod heard of Him; (for His name was spread abroad:) and
   he said, "That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore
   mighty works do shew forth themselves in him."

   15. Others said, "That it is Elias." And others said, "That it is a
   prophet, or as one of the prophets."

   16. But when Herod heard thereof, he said, "It is John, whom I
   beheaded: he is risen from the dead."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: After the preaching of the disciples of Christ, and the working
   of miracles, the Evangelist fitly subjoins an account of the report,
   which arose amongst the people.

   Wherefore he says, "And king Herod heard of Him."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Aut. e Cat. in Marc.: This Herod is the son of the
   first Herod, under whom Joseph had led Jesus into Egypt. But Matthew
   calls him Tetrarch, and Luke mentions him as ruling over one fourth of
   his father's kingdom; for the Romans after the death of his father
   divided his kingdom into four parts. But Mark calls him a king, either
   after the title of his father, or because it was consonant to his own
   wish.

   Pseudo-Jerome: It goes on, "For His name was spread abroad."

   For it is not right that a candle should be placed under a bushel. "And
   they said," that is, some of the multitude, "that John the Baptist was
   risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew themselves
   forth in him."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 25: Here we are taught how great was the envy of the
   Jews. For, lo, they believe that John, of whom it was said that he did
   no miracle, could rise from the dead, and that, without the witness of
   any one. But Jesus, approved of God by miracles and signs, whose
   resurrection, Angles and Apostles, men and women, preached, they chose
   to believe was carried away by stealth, rather than suppose that He had
   risen again.

   And these men, in saying that John was risen from the dead, and that
   therefore mighty works were wrought in him, had just thoughts of the
   power of the resurrection, for men, when they shall have risen from the
   dead, shall have much greater power than they possessed when still
   weighed down by the weakness of the flesh.

   There follows: "But others said, that it is Elias."

   Theophylact: For John confuted many men, when he said, "Ye generation
   of vipers."

   It goes on: "But others said, that it is a prophet, or as one of the
   prophets."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Is seems to me that this
   prophet means that one of whom Moses said, "God will raise up a prophet
   unto thee of thy brethren." [Deut 18:15] They were right indeed, but
   because they feared to say openly, This is the Christ, they used the
   voice of Moses, veiling their own surmise through fear of their rules.

   There follows: "But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom
   I beheaded: he is risen from the dead." Herod expressly says this in
   irony.

   Theophylact: Or else, Herod, knowing that he without a cause had slain
   John, who was a just man, thought that he had risen from the dead, and
   had received through his resurrection the power of working miracles.

   Augustine, de Con. Even., ii, 43: But in these words Luke bears witness
   to Mark, to this point at least, that others and not Herod said that
   John had risen; but Luke had represented Herod as hesitating and has
   put down his words as if he said, "John have I beheaded, but who is
   this of whom I hear such things?" [Luke 9:7]

   We must, however, suppose that after this hesitation he had confirmed
   in his own mind what others had said, for he says to his children, as
   Matthew relates, "This is John the Baptist, he has risen from the
   dead." [Matt 14:2] Or else these words are to be spoken, so as to
   indicate that he is still hesitating, particularly as Mark who had said
   above that others had declared that John had risen from the dead,
   afterwards however is not silent as to Herod's plainly saying, "It is
   John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead." Which words also may
   be spoken in two ways, either they may be understood as those of a man
   affirming or doubting.

   17. For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound
   him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had
   married her.

   18. For John had said unto Herod, "It is not lawful for thee to have
   thy brother's wife."

   19. Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed
   him; but she could not;

   20. For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy,
   and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard
   him gladly.

   21. And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made
   a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;

   22. And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and
   pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the
   damsel, "Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee."

   23. And he sware unto her, "Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
   give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom."

   24. And she went forth, and said unto her mother, "What shall I ask?"
   And she said, "The head of John the Baptist."

   25. And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,
   saying, "I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of
   John the Baptist."

   26. And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for
   their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.

   27. And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his
   head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,

   28. And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and
   the damsel gave it to her mother.

   29. And when the disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
   corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: The Evangelist Mark, taking occasion from what went
   before, here relates the death of the Forerunner, saying, "For Herod
   himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison
   for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her."

   Bede: Ancient history relates, that Philip, the son of Herod the great,
   under whom the Lord fled into Egypt, the brother of this Herod, under
   whom Christ suffered, married Herodias, the daughter of king Aretas;
   but afterwards, that his father-in-law, after certain disagreements had
   arisen with his son-in-law, had taken his daughter away, and, to the
   grief of her former husband, had given her in marriage to his enemy;
   therefore John the Baptist rebukes Herod and Herodias for contracting
   an unlawful union, and because it was not allowed for a man to marry
   his brother's wife during his lifetime.

   Theophylact: The law also commanded a brother to marry his brother's
   wife, if he died without children; but in this case there was a
   daughter, which made the marriage criminal.

   There follows: "Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would
   have killed him; but she could not."

   Bede: For Herodias was afraid, lest Herod should repent at some time,
   or be reconciled to his brother Philip, and so the unlawful marriage be
   divorced.

   It goes on: "For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man, and
   a holy."

   Gloss.: He feared him, I say, because he revered him, for he knew him
   to be just in his dealings with men, and holy towards God, and he took
   care that Herodias should not slay him. "And when he heard him, he did
   many things," for he thought that he spake by the Spirit of God, "and
   heard him gladly," because he considered that what he said was
   profitable.

   Theophylact: But see how great is the fury of lust, for though Herod
   had such an awe and fear of John, he forgets it all, that he may
   minister to his fornication.

   Remig.: For his lustful will drove him to lay hands on a man whom he
   knew to be just and holy. And by this, we may see how a less fault
   became the cause to him of a greater; as it is said, "He which is
   filthy, let him be filthy still." [Rev 22:11]

   It goes on: "And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his
   birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates
   of Galilee."

   Bede: The only men whom we read of, as celebrating their birthdays with
   festive joys are Herod and Pharaoh, but each, with an evil presage,
   stained his birthday with blood; Herod, however, with so much the
   greater wickedness, as he slew the holy and guiltless teacher of truth,
   and that by the wish, and at the instance of a female dancer.

   For there follows: "And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in,
   and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said
   unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it
   thee."

   Theophylact: For during the banquet, Satan danced in the person of the
   damsel, and the wicked oath is completed.

   For it goes on: "And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of
   me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom."

   Bede: His oath does not excuse his murder, for perchance his reason for
   swearing was, that he might find an opportunity for slaying, and if she
   had demanded the death of his father and mother, he surely would not
   have granted it.

   It goes on: "And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I
   ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."

   Worthy is blood to be asked as the reward of such a deed as dancing.

   It goes on: "And she came in straightway with haste, &c."

   Theophylact: The malignant woman begs that the head of John be given to
   her immediately, that is, at once, in that very hour, for she feared
   lest Herod should repent.

   There follows: "And the king was exceeding sorry."

   Bede: It is usual with Scripture, that the historian should relate
   events as they were then believed by all, thus Joseph is called the
   father of Jesus by Mary herself. So now also Herod is said to be
   "exceeding sorry," for so the guests thought, since the hypocrite bore
   sadness on his face, when he had joy in his heart; and he excuses the
   wickedness by his oath, that he might be impious under pretence of
   piety.

   Wherefore there follows: "For his oath's sake, and for their sakes who
   sat with him, he would not reject her."

   Theophylact: Herod not being his own master, but full of lust,
   fulfilled his oath, and slew the just man; it would have been better
   however to break his oath, than to commit so great a sin.

   Bede: In that again which is added, "And for their sakes who sat with
   him," he wishes to make all partakers in his guilt, that a bloody feast
   might be set before luxurious and impure guests.

   Wherefore it goes on: "But sending an executioner, he commanded his
   head to be brought in a charger."

   Theophylact: Spiculator' is the name for the public servant
   commissioned to put men to death.

   Bede: Now Herod was not ashamed to bring before his guests the head of
   a murdered man; but we do not read of such an act of madness in
   Pharaoh. From both examples, however, it is proved to be more useful,
   often to call to mind the coming day of our death, by fear and by
   living chastely, than to celebrate the day of our birth with luxury.
   For man is born in the world to toil, but the elect pass by death out
   of the world to repose.

   It goes on: "And he beheaded him in prison, &c."

   Greg., Mor., 3, 7: I cannot, without the greatest wonder, reflect that
   he, who was filled even in his mother's womb with the spirit of
   prophecy, and who was the greatest that had arisen amongst those born
   of women, is sent into prison by wicked men, is beheaded for the
   dancing of a girl, and though a man of so great austerity, meets death
   through such a foul instrument. Are we to suppose that there was
   something evil in his life, to be wiped away by so ignominious a death?
   When, however, could he commit a sin even in his eating, whose food was
   only locusts, and wild honey? How could he offend in his conversation,
   who never quitted the wilderness? How is it that Almighty God so
   despises in this life those whom He has so sublimely chosen before all
   ages, if it be not for the reason, which is plain to the piety of the
   faithful, that He thus sinks them into the lowest place, because He
   sees how He is rewarding them in the highest, and outwardly He throws
   them down amongst things despised, because inwardly He draws them up
   even to incomprehensible things. Let each then infer from this what
   they shall suffer, whom He rejects, if He so grieves those whom He
   loves.

   There follows: "And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took
   up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb."

   Bede: Josephus relates, that John was brought bound into the castle of
   Macheron, and there slain; and ecclesiastical history says [Theodoret,
   Hist., Eccles., 3, 3] that he was buried in Sebaste, a city of
   Palestine, once called Samaria. But the beheading of John the Baptist
   signifies the lessening of that fame, by which he was thought to be
   Christ by the people, as the raising of our Saviour on the cross
   typifies the advance of the faith, in that He Himself, who was first
   looked upon as a prophet by the multitude, was recognized as the Son of
   God by all the faithful; wherefore John, who was destined to decrease,
   was born when the daylight begins to wax short; but the Lord at that
   season of the year in which the day begins to lengthen.

   Theophylact: In a mystical way, however, Herod, whose name means, of
   skin,' is the people of the Jews, and the wife to whom he was wedded
   means vain glory, whose daughter even now encircles the Jews with her
   dance, namely, a false understanding of the Scriptures; they indeed
   beheaded John, that is, the word of prophecy, and hold to him without
   Christ, his head.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, the head of the law, which is Christ, is cut
   off from His own body, that is, the Jewish people, and is given to a
   Gentile damsel, that is, the Roman Church, and the damsel gives it to
   her adulterous mother, that is, to the synagogue, who in the end will
   believe. The body of John is buried, his head is put in a dish; thus
   the human Letter is covered over, the Spirit is honoured, and received
   on the altar.

   30. And the Apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told
   Him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.

   31. And He said unto them, "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
   place, and rest a while:" for there were many coming and going, and
   they had no leisure so much as to eat.

   32. And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.

   33. And the people saw them departing, and many knew Him, and ran afoot
   thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto
   Him.

   34. And Jesus, when He came out, saw many people, and was moved with
   compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a
   shepherd: and He began to teach them many things.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: The Evangelist, after relating the death of John, gives an
   account of those things which Christ did with His disciples after the
   death of John, saying, "And the Apostles gathered themselves together
   unto Jesus, and told Him all things, both what they had done, and what
   they had taught."

   Pseudo-Jerome: For they return to the fountain-head whence the streams
   flow; those who are sent by God, always offer up thanks for those
   things which they have received.

   Theophylact: Let us also learn, when we are sent on any mission, not to
   go far away, and not to overstep the bounds of the office committed,
   but to go often to him, who sends us, and report all that we have done
   and taught; for we must not only teach but act.

   Bede: Not only do the Apostles tell the Lord what they themselves had
   done and taught, but also His own and John's disciples together tell
   Him what John had suffered, during the time that they were occupied in
   teaching, as Matthew relates.

   It goes on: "And He said to them, Come ye yourselves apart, &c."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 2, 45: This is said to have taken place,
   after the passion of John, therefore what is first related took place
   last, for it was by these events that Herod was moved to say, "This is
   John the Baptist, whom I beheaded."

   Theophylact: Again, He goes into a desert place from His humility. But
   Christ makes His disciples rest, that men who are set over others may
   learn, that they who labour in any work or in the word deserve rest,
   and ought not to labour continually.

   Bede: How arose the necessity for giving rest to His disciples, He
   shews, when He adds, "For there were many coming and going, and they
   had no leisure so much as to eat;" we may then see how great was the
   happiness of that time, both from the toil of the teachers, and from
   the diligence of the learners.

   It goes on: "And embarking in a ship, they departed into a desert place
   privately."

   The disciples did not enter into the ship alone, but taking up the Lord
   with them, they went to a desert place, as Matthew shews. [Matt 14]
   Here He tries the faith of the multitude, and by seeking a desert place
   He would see whether they care to follow Him. And they follow Him, and
   not on horseback, nor in carriages, but laboriously coming on foot,
   they shew how great is their anxiety for their salvation.

   There follows: "And the people saw them departing, and many knew Him,
   and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them."

   In saying that they outwent them on foot, it is proved that the
   disciples with the Lord did not reach the other bank of the sea, or of
   the Jordan, but they went to the nearest places of the same country,
   where the people of those parts could come to them on foot.

   Theophylact: So do thou not wait for Christ till He Himself call you,
   but outrun Him, and come before Him.

   There follows: "And Jesus when He came out saw many people, and was
   moved with compassion towards them, because they were as sheep having
   no shepherd."

   The Pharisees being ravening wolves did not feed the sheep, but
   devoured them; for which reason they gather themselves to Christ, the
   true Shepherd, who gave them spiritual food, that is, the word of God.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He began to teach them many things."

   For seeing that those who followed Him on account of His miracles were
   tired from the length of the way, He pitied them, and wished to satisfy
   their wish by teaching them.

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 26: Matthew says that He healed their sick, for the
   real way of pitying the poor is to open to them the way of truth by
   teaching them, and to take away their bodily pains.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mystically, however, the Lord took apart those whom He
   chose, that though living amongst evil men, they might not apply their
   minds to evil things, as Lot in Sodom, Job in the land of Uz, and
   Obadiah in the house of Ahab.

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 25: Leaving also Judaea, the holy preachers, in the
   desert of the Church, overwhelmed by the burden of their tribulations
   amongst the Jews, obtained rest by the imparting of the grace of faith
   to the Gentiles.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Little indeed is the rest of the saints here on earth,
   long is their labour, but afterwards, they are bidden to rest from
   their labours. But as in the ark of Noah, the animals that were within
   were sent forth, and they that were without rushed in, so is it in the
   Church, Judas went, the thief came to Christ. But as long as men go
   back from the faith, the Church can have no refuge from grief; for
   Rachel weeping for her children would not be comforted. Moreover, this
   world is not the banquet, in which the new wine is drank, when the new
   song will be sung by men made anew, when this mortal shall have put on
   immortality.

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 26: But when Christ goes to the deserts of the
   Gentiles, many bands of the faithful leaving the walls of their cities,
   that is their old manner of living, follow Him.

   35. And when the day was now far spent, His disciples came unto Him,
   and said, "This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:

   36. Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and
   into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to
   eat."

   37. He answered and said unto them, "Give ye them to eat." And they
   said unto Him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread,
   and give them to eat?"

   38. He saith unto them, "How many loaves have ye? go and see." And when
   they knew, they say, "Five, and two fishes."

   39. And He commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the
   green grass.

   40. And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.

   41. And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, He looked
   up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to His
   disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided He among them
   all.

   42. And they did all eat, and were filled.

   43. And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the
   fishes.

   44. And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: The Lord, placing before them, first, what is most
   profitable, that is, the food of the word of God, afterwards also gave
   the multitude food for their bodies; in beginning to relate which, the
   Evangelist say, "And when the day was now far spent, His disciples came
   unto Him, and said, This is a desert place.

   Bede: The time being far spent, points out that it was evening.
   Wherefore Luke says, "But the day had begun to decline."

   Theophylact: See now, how those who are disciples of Christ grow in
   love to man, for they pity the multitudes, and come to Christ to
   intercede for them. But the Lord tried them, to see whether they would
   know that His power was great enough to feed them.

   Wherefore it goes on: "He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to
   eat."

   Bede: By these words He calls on His Apostles, to break bread for the
   people, that they might be able to testify that they had no bread, and
   thus the greatness of the miracle might become more known.

   Theophylact: But the disciples thought that He did not know what was
   necessary for the feeding of so large a multitude, for their answer
   shews that they were troubled.

   For it goes on, "And they said unto Him, Let us go and buy two hundred
   pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 2, 46: This in the Gospel of John is the
   answer to Philip, but Mark gives it as the answer of the disciples,
   wishing it to be understood that Philip made this answer as a
   mouthpiece of the others; although he might put the plural number for
   the singular, as is usual.

   It goes on: "And He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and
   see."

   The other Evangelists pass over this being done by the Lord.

   It goes on: "And when they knew, they say, "Five, and two fishes."

   This, which was suggested by Andrew, as we learn from John, the other
   Evangelists, using the plural for the singular, have put into the mouth
   of the disciples.

   It goes on, "And He commanded them to make all sit down by companies
   upon the green grass, and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by
   fifties."

   But we need not be perplexed, though Luke says that they were ordered
   to sit down by fifties, and Mark by hundreds and fifties, for one has
   mentioned a part, the other the whole. Mark, who mentions the hundreds,
   fills up what the other has left out.

   Theophylact: We are given to understand that they lay down in parties,
   separate from one another, for what is translated by companies, is
   repeated twice over in the Greek, as though it were by companies and
   companies.

   It goes on, "And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fishes,
   He looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave
   them to His disciples to set before them: and the two fishes divided He
   among them all."

   Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., see Hom. in Matt., 49: Now it was
   with fitness that He looked up to heaven, for the Jews, when receiving
   manna in the desert, presumed to say of God, "Can he give bread?" [Ps
   78:20] To prevent this, therefore, before He performed the miracle, He
   referred to His Father when He was about to do.

   Theophylact: He also looks up to heaven, that He may teach us to seek
   our food from God, and not from the devil, as they do who unjustly feed
   on other men's labours. By this also He intimated to the crowd, that He
   could not be opposed to God, since He called upon God. And He gives the
   bread to His disciples to set before the multitude, that by handling
   the bread, they might see that it was an undoubted miracle.

   It goes on: "And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up
   twelve baskets full of the fragments."

   Twelve baskets of fragments remained over and above, that each of the
   Apostles, carrying a basket on his shoulder, might recognise the
   unspeakable wonder of the miracle. For it was a proof of overflowing
   power not only to feed so many men, but also to leave such a
   superabundance of fragments. Even though Moses gave manna, yet what was
   given to each was measured by his necessity, and what was over and
   above was overrun with worms. Elias also fed the woman, but gave her
   just what was enough for her; but Jesus, being the Lord, makes His
   gifts with superabundant profusion.

   Bede: Again, in a mystical sense, the Saviour refreshes the hungry
   crowds at the day's decline, because, either now that the end of the
   world approaches, or now that the Son of justice has set in death for
   us, we are saved from wasting away in spiritual hunger. He calls the
   Apostles to Him at the breaking of bread, intimating that daily by them
   our hungry souls are fed, that is, by their letters and examples. By
   the five loaves are figured the Five Books of Moses, by the two fishes,
   the Psalms and Prophets.

   Theophylact: Or the two fishes are the discourses of fishermen, that
   is, their Epistles and Gospel.

   Bede: [ed. note: The same application to the five senses is found in
   Origen in Matt. 14, 17, and St. Ambrose in Luc., 6, 80. The latter,
   probably, was the source from which Bede borrowed it, as in both it
   forms a portion of a comparison between this miracle and that of the
   four thousand being fed with seven loaves, in which the latter are said
   to be a type of the Christian, who has given up external things.
   Origen, Hom. 3 in Leviticus lays it down as a principle, that the
   number five is almost always taken for the five sense in Scripture.]
   There are five senses in the outward man which shews that by the five
   thousand men are meant those who, living in the world, know how to make
   a good use of external things.

   Greg., Mor. 16, 55: The different ranks in which those who ate lie
   down, mark out the divers churches which make up the one Catholic. [ed.
   note: The number fifty is connected with rest from sin, or remission,
   with an allusion to the Jubilee and to Pentecost by Origen in Matt.
   Tom. xi. 3, and by St. Ambrose Ap. David 8. On number a hundred, as the
   recognized symbol of perfection, see Benedictine Note] But the Jubilee
   rest is contained in the mystery of the number fifty, and fifty must be
   doubled before it reaches up to a hundred. As then the first step is to
   rest from doing evil, that afterwards the soul may rest more fully from
   evil thoughts, some lie down in parties of fifty, others of a hundred.

   Bede: Again, those men lie down on grass and are fed by the food of the
   Lord, who have trodden under foot their concupiscences by continence,
   and apply themselves diligently to hear and fulfil the words of God.
   [ed. note: see Aurea Catena in Matthew, p. 537] The Saviour, however,
   does not create a new sort of food; for when He came in the flesh He
   preached no other things than were predicted, but shewed how pregnant
   with mysteries of grace were the writings of the Law and the Prophets.

   He looks up to heaven, that He may teach us that there we must look for
   grace. He breaks and distributes to the disciples that they may place
   the bread before the multitudes, because He has opened the mysteries of
   prophecy to holy doctors, who are to preach them to the whole world.
   What is left by the crowd is taken up by the disciples, because the
   more sacred mysteries, which cannot be received by the foolish, are not
   to be passed by with negligence, but to be inquired into by the
   perfect. For by the twelve baskets, the Apostles and the following
   Doctors are typified, externally indeed despised by men, but inwardly
   full of healthful food. For all know that carrying baskets is a part of
   the work of slaves.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or, in the gathering of the twelve baskets full of
   fragments, is signified the time, when they shall sit on thrones,
   judging all who are left of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the twelve
   tribes of Israel, when the remnant of Israel shall be saved.

   45. And straightway He constrained His disciples to get into the ship,
   and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while He sent away
   the people.

   46. And when He had sent them away, He departed into a mountain to
   pray.

   47. And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and
   He alone on the land.

   48. And He saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto
   them: and about the fourth watch of the night He cometh unto them,
   walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.

   49. But when they saw Him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had
   been a spirit, and cried out:

   50. For they all saw Him, and were troubled. And immediately He talked
   with them, and saith unto them, "Be of good cheer: it is I; be not
   afraid."

   51. And He went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and
   they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.

   52. For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart
   was hardened.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: The Lord indeed by the miracle of the loaves shewed that He is
   the Creator of the world: but now by walking on the waves He proved
   that He had a body free from the weight of all sin, and by appeasing
   the winds and by calming the rage of the waves, He declared Himself to
   be the Master of the elements.

   Wherefore it is said, "And straightway He constrained His disciples to
   get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida,
   while He sent away the people."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He dismisses indeed the
   people with His blessing and with some cures. But He constrained His
   disciples, because they could not without pain separate themselves from
   Him, and that, not only on account of the very great affection which
   they had for Him, but also because they were at a loss how He would
   join them.

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 27: But it is with reason that we wonder how Mark
   says, that after the miracle of the loaves the disciples crossed the
   sea of Bethsaida, when Luke relates that the miracle was done in the
   parts of Bethsaida [Luke 9:10], unless we understand that Luke means by
   the desert which is Bethsaida not the country immediately around the
   town, but the desert places belonging to it. But when Mark says that
   they should "go before unto Bethsaida," the town itself is meant.

   It goes on: "And when He had sent them away, He departed into a
   mountain to pray."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: This we must understand of
   Christ, in that He is man; He does it also to teach us to be constant
   in prayer.

   Theophylact: But when He had dismissed the crowd, He goes up to pray,
   for prayer requires rest and silence.

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 28: Not every man, however, who prays goes up into a
   mountain, but he alone prays well, who seeks God in prayer. But he who
   prays for riches or worldly labour, or for the death of his enemy,
   sends up from the lowest depths his vile prayers to God.

   John says, "When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and
   take Him by force and make Him a king, He departed against into a
   mountain Himself, alone." [John 6:15]

   It goes on: "And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the
   sea, and He alone on the land."

   Theophylact: Now the Lord permitted His disciples to be in danger, that
   they might learn patience; wherefore He did not immediately come to
   their aid, but allowed them to remain in danger all night, that He
   might teach them to wait patiently, and not to hope at once for help in
   tribulations.

   For there follows: "And He saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was
   contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night, He cometh
   unto them walking upon the sea."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Holy Scripture reckons four
   watches in the night, making each division three hours; wherefore by
   the fourth watch it means that which is after the ninth hour, that is,
   in the tenth or some following hour.

   There follows: "And would have passed them."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 2, 47: But how could they understand this,
   except from His going a different way, wishing to pass them as
   strangers; for they were so far from recognizing Him, as to take Him
   for a spirit.

   For it goes on: "But when they saw Him walking upon the sea, they
   supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out."

   Theophylact: See again how Christ, though He was about to put and end
   to their dangers, puts them in greater fear. But He immediately
   reassured them by His voice, for it continues, "And immediately He
   talked with them, and said unto them, It is I, be not afraid."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 50: As soon then as they knew Him by His voice,
   their fear left them.

   Augustine: How then could He wish to pass them, whose fears He so
   reassures, if it were not that His wish to pass them would wring from
   them that cry, which called for His help?

   Bede: [ed. note: This opinion with which Theodorus is charged was one
   held by the Phantasiasts, a sect of the Monophysites. The denial of the
   human body to our Lord, was a natural consequence of denying Him a
   human soul, for how could a human body inclose, so to speak, His
   Divinity? Theodoras was Bishop of Pharan, in Arabia, and was condemned
   as the author of the Monothelite heresy in the Lateran Council under
   Pope Martin I, AD 649. The passage from Dionysius is quoted in Actio 3
   of the Council, and occurs de Div. Nom, c. 1] But Theodorus, who was
   Bishop of Phanara, wrote that the Lord had no bodily weight in His
   flesh, and walked on the sea without weight; but the Catholic faith
   declares that He had weight according to the flesh. For Dionysius says,
   We know not how without plunging in His feet, which had bodily weight
   and the gravity of matter, He could walk on the wet and unstable
   substance.

   Theophylact: Then by entering into the ship, the Lord restrained the
   tempest. For it continues, "And He went up unto them into the ship, and
   the wind ceased." Great indeed is the miracle of our Lord's walking on
   the sea, but the tempest and the contrary wind were there as well, to
   make the miracle greater. For the Apostles, not understanding from the
   miracle of the five loaves the power of Christ, now more fully knew it
   from the miracle of the sea.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And they were sore amazed in themselves." For
   they understood not concerning the loaves.

   Bede: The disciples indeed, who were still carnal, were amazed at the
   greatness of His virtue, they could not yet however recognise in Him
   the truth of the Divine Majesty. Wherefore it goes on, "For their
   hearts were hardened."

   But mystically, the toil of the disciples in rowing, and the contrary
   wind, mark out the labours of the Holy Church, who amidst the beating
   waves of the world, and the blasts of unclean spirits, strives to reach
   the repose of her celestial country. And well is it said that the ship
   was in the midst of the sea, and He alone on land, for sometimes the
   Church is afflicted by a pressure from the Gentiles so overwhelming,
   that her Redeemer seems to have entirely deserted her. But the Lord
   sees His own, toiling on the sea, for, lest they faint in tribulations,
   He strengthens them by the look of His love, and sometimes frees them
   by a visible assistance. Further, in the fourth watch He came to them
   as daylight approached, for when man lifts up his mind to the light of
   guidance from on high, the Lord will be with him, and the dangers of
   temptations will be laid asleep.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else, the first watch
   means the time up to the deluge; the second, up to Moses; the third, up
   to the coming of the Lord; in the fourth the Lord came and spoke to His
   disciples.

   Bede: Often then does the love of heaven seem to have deserted the
   faithful in tribulation, so that it may be thought that Jesus wishes to
   pass by His disciples, as it were, toiling in the sea. And still do
   heretics suppose that the Lord was a phantom, and did not take upon Him
   real flesh from the Virgin.

   Pseudo-Jerome: And He says to them, "Be of good cheer, it is I,"
   because we shall see Him as He is. But the wind and the storm ceased
   when Jesus sat down, that is, reigned in the ship, which is the
   Catholic Church.

   Bede: In whatsoever heart, also, He is present by the grace of His
   love, there soon all the strivings of vices, and of the adverse world,
   or of evil spirits, are kept under and put to rest.

   53. And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
   Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.

   54. And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew Him,

   55. And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry
   about in beds those that were sick, where they heard He was.

   56. And whithersoever He entered, into villages, or cities, or country,
   they laid the sick in the streets, and besought Him that they might
   touch if it were but the border of His garment: and as many as touched
   Him were made whole.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: The Evangelist, having shewn the danger which the disciples had
   sustained in their passage, and their deliverance from it, now shews
   the place to which they sailed, saying, "And when they had passed over,
   they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore."

   Theophylact: The Lord remained at the above-mentioned place for some
   time. Therefore the Evangelist subjoins, "And when they had come out of
   the ship, straightway they knew Him," That is, the inhabitants of the
   country.

   Bede: But they knew Him by report, not by His features; or through the
   greatness of His miracles, even His person was known to some. See too
   how great was the faith of the men of the land of Gennesaret, so that
   they were not content with the healing of those who were present, but
   sent to other towns round about, that all might hasten to the
   Physician; wherefore there follows, "And ran through the whole region
   round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick,
   where they heard He was."

   Theophylact: For they did not call Him to their houses that He might
   heal them, but rather the sick themselves were brought to Him.

   Wherefore it also follows: "And whithersoever He entered into villages,
   or cities, or country, &c."

   For the miracle which had been wrought on the woman with an issue of
   blood, had reached the ears of many, and caused in them that great
   faith, by which they were healed.

   It goes on: "And as many as touched Him were made whole."

   Again, in a mystical sense, do thou understand by the hem of His
   garment the slightest of His commandments, for whosoever shall
   transgress it "shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven,"
   [Matt. 5:19] or else His assumption of our flesh, by which we have come
   to the Word of God, and afterwards, shall have the enjoyment of His
   majesty.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Furthermore that which is said, "And as many as touched
   Him were made whole," shall be fulfilled, when grief and mourning shall
   fly away.

Chapter 7

   1. Then came together unto Him the Pharisees, and certain of the
   Scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

   2. And when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, that
   is to say, the unwashen, hands, they found fault.

   3. For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands
   oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

   4. And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not.
   And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as
   the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.

   5. Then the Pharisees and Scribes asked Him, "Why walk not thy
   disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with
   unwashen hands?"

   6. He answered and said unto them, "Well hath Esaias [Isaiah]
   prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth
   me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

   7. Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
   commandments of men.'

   8. For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
   men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things
   ye do.

   9. And He said unto them, "Full well ye reject the commandment of God,
   that ye may keep your own tradition.

   10. For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother;' and, Whoso
   curseth father or mother, let him die the death:'

   11. But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother - It is
   Corban - that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be
   profited by me; he shall be free.'

   12. And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;

   13. Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which
   ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 29: The people of the land of Gennesareth, who
   seemed to be unlearned men, not only come themselves, but also bring
   their sick to the Lord, that they may but succeed in touching the hem
   of His garment. But the Pharisees and Scribes, who ought to have been
   the teachers of the people, run together to the Lord, not to seek for
   healing, but to move captious questions.

   Wherefore it is said, "Then there came together unto Him the Pharisees
   and certain of the Scribes, coming from Jerusalem; and when they saw
   some of His disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashen
   hands, they found fault."

   Theophylact: For the disciples of the Lord, who were taught only the
   practice of virtue, used to eat in a simple way, without washing their
   hands; but the Pharisees, wishing to find an occasion of blame against
   them, took it up; they did not indeed blame them as transgressors of
   the law, but for transgressing the traditions of the elders.

   Wherefore it goes on: "For the Pharisees and all the Jews, except they
   wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders."

   Bede: For taking the spiritual words of the Prophets in a carnal sense,
   they observed, by washing the body alone, commandments which concerned
   the chastening of the heart and deeds, saying, "Wash you, make you
   clean;" [Isa 1:16] and again, "Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the
   Lord." [Isa 52.11]

   It is therefore a superstitious human tradition, that men who are clean
   already, should wash oftener because they eat bread, and that they
   should not eat on leaving the market, without washing. But it is
   necessary for those who desire to partake of the bread which comes down
   from heaven, often to cleanse their evil deeds by alms, by tears, and
   the other fruits of righteousness. It is also necessary for a man to
   wash thoroughly away the pollutions which he has contracted from the
   cares of temporal business, by being afterwards intent on good thoughts
   and works.

   In vain, however, do the Jews wash their hands, and cleanse themselves
   after the market, so long as they refuse to be washed in the font of
   the Saviour; in vain do they observe the washing of their vessels, who
   neglect to wash away the filthy sins of their bodies and of their
   hearts.

   It goes on: "Then the Scribes and Pharisees asked Him, Why walk not thy
   disciples after the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with common
   hands?"

   Jerome, Hier. in Matt., 15: Wonderful is the folly of the Pharisees and
   Scribes; they accuse the Son of God, because He keeps not the
   traditions and precepts of men. But "common" is here put for unclean;
   for the people of the Jews, boasting that they were the portion of God,
   called those meats common, which all made use of.

   Pseudo-Jerome: He beats back the vain words of the Pharisees with His
   arguments, as men drive back dogs with weapons, by interpreting Moses
   and Isaiah, that we too by the word of Scripture may conquer the
   heretics, who oppose us.

   Wherefore it goes on: "Well hath Esaia prophesied of you hypocrites; as
   it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their
   heart is far from me." [Isa 29:13]

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: For since they unjustly
   accused the disciples not of trangressing the law, but the commands of
   the elders, He sharply confounds them, calling them hypocrites, as
   looking with reverence upon what was not worthy of it. He adds,
   however, the words of Isaiah the prophet, as spoken to them; as though
   He would say, As those men, of whom it is said, "that they honour God
   with their lips, whilst their heart is far from Him," in vain pretend
   to observe the dictates of piety, whilst they honour the doctrines of
   men, so ye also neglect your soul, of which you should take care, and
   blame those who live justly.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But Pharisaical tradition, as to tables and vessels, is
   to be cut off, and cast away. For they often make the commands of God
   yield to the traditions of men.

   Wherefore it continues, "For laying aside the commandments of God, ye
   hold to the traditions of men, as the washing of pots and cups."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Moreover, to convict them of
   neglecting the reverence due to God, for the sake of the tradition of
   the elders, which was opposed to the Holy Scriptures, He subjoins, "For
   Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father
   or mother, let him die the death."

   Bede: The sense of the word honour in Scripture is not so much the
   saluting and paying court to men, as alms-giving, and bestowing gifts;
   "honour," says the Apostle, "widows who are widows indeed." [1 Tim 5:3]

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Notwithstanding the
   existence of such a divine law, and the threats against such as break
   it, ye lightly transgress the commandment of God, observing the
   traditions of the Elders.

   Wherefore there follows: "But ye say, If a man shall say to his father
   or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou
   mightest be profited by me;" understand, he will be freed from the
   observation of the foregoing command.

   Wherefore it continues, "And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his
   father or his mother."

   Theophylact: For the Pharisees, wishing to devour the offerings,
   instructed sons, when their parents asked for some of their property,
   to answer them, what thou hast asked of me is corban, that is, a gift,
   I have already offered it up to the Lord; thus the parents would not
   require it, as being offered up to the Lord, (and in that way
   profitable for their own salvation). [ed. note: the words in the
   parenthesis are not in Theophylact]

   Thus they deceived the sons into neglecting their parents, whilst they
   themselves devoured the offerings; with this therefore the Lord
   reproaches them, as transgressing the law of God for the sake of gain.
   Wherefore it goes on, "Making the word of God of none effect through
   your traditions, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do
   ye;" transgressing, that is, the commands of God, that ye may observe
   the traditions of men.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else it may be said, that
   the Pharisees taught young persons, that if a man offered a gift in
   expiation of the injury done to his father or mother, he was free from
   sin, as having given to God the gifts which are owed to a parent; and
   in saying this, they did not allow parents to be honoured.

   Bede: The passage may in a few words have this sense, Every gift which
   I have to make, will go to do you good; for ye compel children, it is
   meant, to say to their parents, that gift which I was going to offer to
   God, I expend on feeding you, and does you good, oh father and mother,
   speaking this ironically. Thus they would be afraid to accept what had
   been given into the hands of God, and might prefer a life of poverty to
   living on consecrated property.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mystically, again, the disciples eating with unwashed
   hands signifies the future fellowship of the Gentiles with the
   Apostles. The cleaning and washing of the Pharisees is barren; but the
   fellowship of the Apostles, though without washing, has stretched out
   its branches as far as the sea.

   14. And when he had called all the people unto Him, He said unto them,
   "Hearken unto Me every one of you, and understand:

   15. There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can
   defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are they that
   defile the man.

   16. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."

   17. And when He was entered into the house from the people, His
   disciples asked Him concerning the parable.

   18. And He saith unto them, "Are ye so without understanding also? Do
   ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the
   man, it cannot defile him;

   19. Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and
   goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?"

   20. And He said, "That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the
   man.

   21. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
   adulteries, fornications, murders,

   22. Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil
   eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

   23. All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: The Jews regard and murmur
   about only the bodily purification of the law; our Lord wishes to bring
   in the contrary.

   Wherefore it is said, "And when He had called all the people unto Him,
   He said unto them, Hearken unto Me every one, and understand: there is
   nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him, but
   the things which come out of a man, those are they which defile a man;"
   that is, which make him unclean.

   The things of Christ have relation to the inner man, but those which
   are of the law are visible and external, to which, as being bodily, the
   cross of Christ was shortly to put an end.

   Theophylact: But the intention of the Lord in saying this was to teach
   men, that the observing of meats, which the law commands, should not be
   taken in a carnal sense, and from this He began to unfold to them the
   intent of the law.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Again He subjoins, "If any
   man have ears to hear, let him hear." For He had not clearly shewn
   them, what those things are which proceed out of a man, and defile a
   man; and on account of this saying, the Apostles thought that the
   foregoing discourse of the Lord implied some other deep thing.

   Wherefore there follows: "And when He was entered into the house from
   the people, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable;" they
   called it parable, because it was not clear.

   Theophylact: The Lord begins by chiding them, wherefore there follows,
   "Are ye so without understanding also?"

   Bede: For that man is a faulty hearer who considers what is obscure to
   be a clear speech, or what is clear to be obscurely spoken.

   Theophylact: Then the Lord shews them what was hidden, saying, "Do ye
   not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man,
   it cannot make him common?"

   Bede: For the Jews, boasting themselves to be the portion of God, call
   common those meals which all men use, as shellfish, hares, and animals
   of that sort. Not even however what is offered to idols is unclean, in
   as far as it is food and God's creature; it is the invocation of devils
   which makes it unclean; and He adds the cause of it, saying, "Because
   it entereth not into his heart."

   The principal seat of the soul according to Plato is the brain, but
   according to Christ, it is in the heart.

   Gloss [ed. note: It is probable that most, if not all the Glosses which
   cannot be found, are from St. Thomas himself, and this one is
   especially like his language, as may be seen by referring to Summa, 2,
   2, Q148, Art 1, and 1, Q119, Art 1, in both of which places also he
   quotes the passages in St. Matthew parallel to this part of St. Mark.]
   It says therefore into his heart, that is, into his mind, which is the
   principal part of his soul, on which his whole life depends; wherefore
   it is necessary, that according to the state of his heart a man should
   be called clean or unclean, and thus whatsoever does not reach the
   soul, cannot bring pollution to the man.

   Meats therefore, since they do not reach the soul, cannot in their own
   nature defile a man; but an inordinate use of meats, which proceeds
   from a want of order in the mind, makes men unclean.

   But that meats cannot reach the mind, He shews by that which He adds,
   saying, "But into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging
   all meats." This however He says, without referring to what remains
   from the food in the body, for that which is necessary for the
   nourishment and growth of the body remains. But that which is
   superfluous goes out, and thus as it were purges the nourishment, which
   remains.

   Augustine: For some things are joined to others in such a way as both
   to change and be changed, just as food, losing its former appearance,
   is both itself turned into our body, and we too are changed, and our
   strength is refreshed by it.

   [ed. note: The last words of this comment are not in St. Augustine, but
   in Bede, who took them originally from St. Jerome's Commentary on
   Matthew, from whence most of Bede's remarks on this passage are taken
   word for word. As the sentence marked Bede is not found in him, it
   probably belongs to the Gloss, and his name has been transferred from
   the former sentence.] Further, a most subtle liquid, after the food has
   been prepared and digested in our veins, and other arteries, by some
   hidden channels, called from a Greek word, pores, passes through us,
   and goes into the draught.

   Bede: Thus then it is not meat that makes men unclean, but wickedness,
   which works in us the passions which come from within.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He said, That which cometh out of a man,
   that defileth a man."

   Gloss.: The meaning of which He points out, when He subjoins, "for from
   within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts."

   And thus it appears that evil thoughts belong to the mind, which is
   here called the heart, and according to which a man is called good or
   bad, clean or unclean.

   Bede: From this passage are condemned those men who suppose that
   thoughts are put into them by the devil, and do not arise from their
   own evil will. The devil may excite and help on evil thoughts, he
   cannot be their author.

   Gloss.: From evil thoughts, however, evil actions proceed to greater
   lengths, concerning which it is added, adulteries, that is, acts which
   consist in the violation of another man's bed; fornications, which are
   unlawful connexions between persons, not bound by marriage; murders, by
   which hurt is inflicted on the person of one's neighbour; thefts, by
   which his goods are taken from him; covetousness, by which things are
   unjustly kept; wickedness, which consists in calumniating others;
   deceit, in overreaching them; lasciviousness, to which belongs any
   corruption of mind or body.

   Theophylact: An evil eye, that is, hatred and flattery, for he who
   hates turns an evil and envious eye on him whom he hates, and a
   flatterer, looking askance at his neighbour's goods, leads him into
   evil; blasphemies, that is, faults committed against God; pride, that
   is, contempt of God, when a man ascribes the good, which he does, not
   to God, but to his own virtue; foolishness, that is, an injury against
   one's neighbour.

   Gloss. [ed. note: see Summa 2, 2, Q46, 1, and 1, 2, Q1, 1]: Or,
   foolishness consists in wrong thoughts concerning God; for it is
   opposed to wisdom, which is the knowledge of divine things. It goes on:
   "All these evil things come from within, and defile the man." For
   whatsoever is in the power of a man, is imputed to him as a fault,
   because all such things proceed from the interior will, by which man is
   master of his own actions.

   24. And from thence He arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and
   Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it; but He
   could not be hid.

   25. For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
   heard of Him, and came and fell at His feet:

   26. The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought
   Him that He would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

   27. But Jesus said unto her, "Let the children first be filled: for it
   is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the
   dogs."

   28. And she answered and said unto Him, "Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under
   the table eat of the children's crumbs."

   29. And He said unto her, "For this saying go thy way; the devil is
   gone out of thy daughter."

   30. And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out,
   and her daughter laid upon the bed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After that the Lord had finished His teaching concerning
   food, seeing that the Jews were incredulous, He enters into the country
   of the Gentiles, for the Jews being unfaithful, salvation turns itself
   to the Gentiles.

   Wherefore it is said, "And from thence He arose, and went into the
   borders of Tyre and Sidon."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Tyre and Sidon were places
   of the Canaanites, therefore the Lord comes to them, not as to His own,
   but as to men, who had nothing in common with the fathers to whom the
   promise was made. And therefore He comes in such a way, that His coming
   should not be known to the Tyrians and Sidonians.

   Wherefore it continues: "and entered into a house, and would have no
   man know it." For the time had not come for His dwelling with the
   Gentiles and bringing them to the faith, for this was not to be, till
   after His cross and resurrection.

   Theophylact: Or else, His reason for coming in secret was that the Jews
   should not find occasion of blame against Him, as if He had passed over
   to the unclean Gentiles.

   It goes on: "But He could not be hid."

   Pseudo-Augustine, Quaest e Vet. et N. Test. 77: But if He wished to do
   so and could not, it appears as if His will was impotent; it is not
   possible however that our Saviour's will should not be fulfilled, nor
   can He will a thing, which He knows ought not be.

   Therefore when a thing has taken place, it may be asserted that He has
   willed it. But we should observe that this happened amongst the
   Gentiles, to whom it was not time to preach; nevertheless not to
   receive them, when they came to the faith of their own accord, would
   have been to grudge them the faith.

   So then it came to pass that the Lord was not made known by His
   disciples; others, however, who had seen Him entering the house,
   recognized Him, and it began to be known that He was there. His will
   therefore was that He should not be proclaimed by His own disciples,
   but that others should come to seek Him, and so it took place.

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 30: Having entered also into the house, He commanded
   His disciples not to betray who He was to anyone in this unknown
   region, that they, on whom He had bestowed the grace of healing, might
   learn by His example, as far as they could, to shrink from the glory of
   human praise in the shewing forth of their miracles; yet they were not
   to cease from the pious work of virtue, when either the faith of the
   good justly deserved that miracles should be done, or the
   unfaithfulness of the wicked might necessarily compel them. For He
   Himself made known His entry into that place to the Gentile woman, and
   to whomsoever He would.

   Pseudo-Aug.: Lastly, the Canaanitish woman came in to Him, on hearing
   of Him; if she had not first submitted herself to the God of the Jews,
   she would not have obtained their benefit. Concerning her it continues:
   "For a woman, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, as soon as she had
   heard of Him, came in and fell at His feet."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Now by this the Lord wished
   to shew His disciples that He opened the door of faith even to the
   Gentiles, wherefore also the nation of the woman is described when it
   is added, "The woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician by nation," that
   is, from Syria and Phaenice.

   It goes on: "and she besought Him that He would cast forth the devil
   out of her daughter."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 2, 49: It appears however that some question
   about a discrepancy may be raised, because it is said that the Lord was
   in the house when the woman came, asking about her daughter. When,
   however, Matthew says that His disciples had suggested to Him, "Send
   her away, for she crieth after us," [Matt 15:23] He appears to imply
   nothing less than that the woman uttered supplicating cries after the
   Lord, as He walked. How then do we infer that she was in the house,
   except by gathering it from Mark, who says that she came in to Jesus,
   after having before said that He was in the house? But Matthew in that
   he says, "He answered her not a word," gave us to understand that He
   went out, during that silence, from the house; thus too the other
   events are connected together, so that they now in no way disagree.

   It continues: "But He said unto her, Let the children be first filled."

   Bede: The time will come when even you who are Gentiles will obtain
   salvation; but it is right that first the Jews who deservedly are wont
   to be called by the name of children of God's ancient election, should
   be refreshed with heavenly bread, and that so at length, the food of
   life should be ministered to the Gentiles.

   There follows: "For it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to
   cast it to the dogs."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: These words He uttered not
   that there is in Him a deficiency of virtue, to prevent His ministering
   to all, but because His benefit, if ministered to both Jews and
   Gentiles who had no communication with each other, might be a cause of
   jealousy.

   Theophylact: He calls the Gentiles dogs, as being thought wicked by the
   Jews; and He means by bread, the benefit which the Lord promised to the
   children, that is, to the Jews. The sense therefore is, that it is not
   right for the Gentiles first to be partakers of the benefit, promised
   principally to the Jews. The reason, therefore, why the Lord does not
   immediately hear, but delays His grace, is, that He may also shew that
   the faith of the woman was firm, and that we may learn not at once to
   grow weary in prayer, but to continue earnest till we obtain.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: In like manner also to shew
   the Jews that He did not confer healing on foreigners in the same
   degree as to them, and that by the discovery of the woman's faith, the
   unfaithfulness of the Jews might be the more laid bare. For the woman
   did not take it ill, but with much reverence assented to what the Lord
   had said.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And she answered and said unto Him, Truth, Lord,
   but the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs."

   Theophylact: As if she had said, The Jews have the whole of that bread
   which comes down from heaven, and Thy benefits also; I ask for the
   crumbs, that is, a small portion of the benefit.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Her placing herself
   therefore in the rank of dogs is a mark of her reverence; as if she
   said, I hold it as a favour to be even in the position of a dog, and to
   eat not from another table, but from that of the Master himself.

   Theophylact: Because therefore the woman answered with much wisdom, she
   obtained what she wanted; wherefore there follows, "And He said unto
   her, &c." He said not, My virtue hath made thee whole, but for this
   saying, that is, for thy faith, which is shewn by this saying, "go thy
   way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter."

   It goes on: "And when she was come into her house, she found her
   daughter laid upon the bed, and the devil gone out."

   Bede: On account then of the humble and faithful saying of her mother,
   the devil left the daughter; here is given a precedent for catechising
   and baptizing infants, seeing that by the faith and the confession of
   the parents, infants are freed in baptism from the devil, though they
   can neither have knowledge in themselves, or do either good or evil.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mystically however the Gentile woman, who prays for her
   daughter, is our mother the Church of Rome. Her daughter afflicted with
   a devil, is the barbarian western race, which by faith hath been turned
   from a dog into a sheep. She desires to take the crumbs of spiritual
   understanding, not the unbroken bread of the letter.

   Theophylact: The soul of each of us also, when he falls into sin,
   becomes a woman; and this soul has a daughter who is sick, that is,
   evil actions; this daughter again has a devil, for evil actions arise
   from devils. Again, sinners are called dogs, being filled with
   uncleanness. For which reason we are not worthy to receive the bread of
   God, or to be made partakers of the immaculate mysteries of God; if
   however in humility, knowing ourselves to be dogs, we confess our sins,
   then the daughter, that is, our evil life, shall be healed.

   31. And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, He came
   unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.

   32. And they bring unto Him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in
   his speech; and they beseech him to put His hand upon him.

   33. And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His fingers into
   his ears, and He spit, and touched His tongue;

   34. And looking up to heaven, He sighed, and saith unto him,
   "Ephphatha," that is, "Be opened."

   35. And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue
   was loosed, and he spake plain.

   36. And He charged them that they should tell no man: but the more He
   charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;

   37. And were beyond measure astonished, saying, "He hath done all
   things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: The Lord did not wish to stay in the parts of the
   Gentiles, lest He should give the Jews occasion to say, that they
   esteemed Him a transgressor of the law, because He held communion with
   the Gentiles, and therefore He immediately returns.

   Wherefore it is said, "And again departing from the coasts of Tyre, He
   came through Sidon, to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the
   borders of Decapolis."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 31: Decapolis is a region of ten cities, across the
   Jordan, to the east, over against Galilee [ed. note: It appears,
   however, from Reland, Pales. v.1, p198, that a portion of Decapolis,
   including its metropolis, Scythopolis, was on this side Jordan, and
   therefore this text of St. Mark may be taken literally.] When therefore
   it is said that the Lord came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst
   of the borders of Decapolis, it does not mean that He entered the
   confines of Decapolis themselves; for He is not said to have crossed
   the sea, but rather to have come to the borders of the sea, and to have
   reached quite up to the place, which was opposite to the midst of the
   coasts of Decapolis, which were situated at a distance across the sea.

   It goes on, "And they bring Him one that was deaf and dumb, and they
   besought Him to lay hands upon him."

   Theophylact: Which is rightly placed after the deliverance of one
   possessed with a devil, for such an instance of suffering came from the
   devil.

   There follows, "And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His
   fingers into his ears."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He takes the deaf and dumb
   man who was brought to Him apart from the crowd, that He might not do
   His divine miracles openly; teaching us to cast away vain glory and
   swelling of heart, for no one can work miracles as he can, who loves
   humility and is lowly in his conduct. But He puts His fingers into his
   ears, when He might have cured him with a word, to shew that His body,
   being united to Deity, was consecrated by Divine virtue, with all that
   He did. For since on account of the transgression of Adam, human nature
   had incurred much suffering and hurt in its members and senses, Christ
   coming into the world shewed the perfection of human nature in Himself,
   and on this account opened ears, with His fingers, and gave the power
   of speech by His spittle.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And spit, and touched his tongue."

   Theophylact: That He might shew that all the members of His sacred body
   are divine and holy, even the spittle which loosed the string of the
   tongue. For the spittle is only the superflous moisture of the body,
   but in the Lord, all things are divine.

   It goes on, "And looking up to heaven, He groaned, and saith unto him,
   Ephphatha, that is, Be opened."

   Bede: He looked up to heaven, that He might teach us that thence is to
   be procured speech for the dumb, hearing for the deaf, health for all
   who are sick. And He sighed, not that it was necessary for Him to be
   any thing from His Father with groaning, for He, together with the
   Father, gives all things to them who ask, but that He might give us an
   example of sighing, when for our own errors and those of our
   neighbours, we invoke the guardianship of the Divine mercy.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He at the same time also
   groaned, as taking our cause upon Himself and pitying human nature,
   seeing the misery into which it had fallen.

   Bede: But that which He says, "Ephphatha, that is, Be opened," belong
   properly to the ears, for the ears are to be opened for hearing, but
   the tongue to be loosed from the bonds of its impediment, that is may
   be able to speak.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And straightway his ears were opened, and the
   string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain."

   Where each nature of one and the same Christ is manifestly distinct,
   looking up indeed into Heaven as man, praying unto God, He groaned, but
   presently with one word, as being strong in the Divine Majesty, He
   healed.

   It goes on, "And He charged them that they should tell no man."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: By which He has taught us
   not to boast in our powers, but in the cross and humiliation. He also
   bade them conceal the miracle, lest He should excite the Jews by envy
   to kill Him before the time.

   Pseudo-Jerome: A city, however, placed on a hill cannot be hid, and
   lowliness always comes before glory.

   Wherefore it goes on, "but the more He charged them, so much the more a
   great deal they published it."

   Theophylact: By this we are taught, when we confer benefits on any, by
   no means to seek for applause and praise; but when we have received
   benefits, to proclaim and praise our benefactors, even though they be
   unwilling.

   Augustine: If however He, as one Who knew the present and the future
   wills of men, knew that they would proclaim Him the more in proportion
   as He forbade them, why did He give them this command? If it were not
   that He wished to prove to men who are idle, how much more joyfully,
   with how much greater obedience, they whom He commands to proclaim Him
   should preach, when they who were forbidden could not hold their peace.

   Gloss.: From the preaching however of those who were healed by Christ,
   the wonder of the multitude, and their praise of the benefits of
   Christ, increased.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And they were beyond measure astonished, saying,
   He hath done all things well; he maketh the deaf to hear, and the dumb
   to speak."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mystically, Tyre is interpreted, narrowness, and
   signifies Judaea, to which the Lord said, "For the bed is grown too
   narrow," [Isa 28:20] and from which He turns Himself to the Gentiles.
   Sidon means, hunting, for our race is like an untamed beast, and "sea",
   which means a wavering inconstancy. Again, the Saviour comes to save
   the Gentiles in the midst of the coasts of Decapolis, which may be
   interpreted, as the commands of the Decalogue.

   Further, the human race throughout its many members is reckoned as one
   man, eaten up by varying pestilence, in the first created man; it is
   blinded, that is, its eye is evil; it becomes deaf, when it listens to,
   and dumb when it speaks, evil. And they prayed Him to lay His hand upon
   him, because many just men, and patriarchs, wished and longed for the
   time when the Lord should come in the flesh.

   Bede: Or he is deaf and dumb, who neither has ears to hear the words of
   God, nor opens his mouth to speak them, and such must be presented to
   the Lord for healing, by men who have already learned to hear and speak
   the divine oracles.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Further, he who obtains healing is always drawn aside
   from turbulent thoughts, disorderly actions, and incoherent speeches.
   And the fingers which are put into the ears are the words and the gifts
   of the Holy Ghost, of whom it is said, "This is the finger of God." [Ex
   8:19; Luke 11:20]

   The spittle is heavenly wisdom, which loosens the sealed lips of the
   human race, so that it can say, I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
   and the rest of the Creed. "And looking up to heaven, he groaned," that
   is, He taught us to groan, and to raise up the treasures of our hearts
   to the heavens; because by the groaning of hearty compunction, the
   silly joy of the flesh is purged away. But the ears are opened to
   hymns, and songs, and psalms; and He looses the tongue, that it may
   pour forth the good word, which neither threats nor stripes can
   restrain.

Chapter 8

   1. In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to
   eat, Jesus called His disciples unto Him, and saith unto them,

   2. "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with
   Me three days, and have nothing to eat:

   3. And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint
   by the way: for divers of them came from far."

   4. And His disciples answered Him, "From whence can a man satisfy these
   men with bread here in the wilderness."

   5. And He asked them, "How many loaves have ye?" And they said,
   "Seven."

   6. And He commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and He took
   the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to His disciples
   to set before them; and they did set them before the people.

   7. And they had a few small fishes: and He blessed, and commanded to
   set them also before them.

   8. So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken
   meat that was left seven baskets.

   9. And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and He sent them
   away.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After the Lord had performed the former miracle concerning
   the multiplication of the loaves, now again, a fitting occasion
   presents itself, and He takes the opportunity of working a similar
   miracle.

   Wherefore it is said, "In those days, the multitude being very great,
   and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples unto Him, and
   saith unto them, I have compassion on the multitude, because they have
   now been with Me three days, and have nothing to eat."

   For He did not always work miracles concerning the feeding of the
   multitude, lest they should follow Him for the sake of food; now
   therefore He would not have performed this miracle, if He had not seen
   that the multitude was in danger.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And if I send them away fasting to their own
   houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 32: Why they who came from afar hold out for three
   days, Matthew says more fully: "And He went up into a mountain, and sat
   down there, and great multitudes came unto Him, having with them many
   sick persons, and cast them down at Jesus' feet, and He healed them."
   [Matt. 15:29-30]

   Theophylact: The disciples did not yet understand, nor did they believe
   in His virtue, notwithstanding former miracles; wherefore it continues,
   "And His disciples said unto Him, From whence can a man satisfy these
   men with bread here in the wilderness?"

   But the Lord Himself does not blame them, teaching us that we should
   not be grievously angry with ignorant men and those who do not
   understand, but bear with their ignorance.

   After this it continues, "And He asked them, How many loaves have ye?
   and they answered, Seven.

   Remig.: Ignorance was not His reason for asking them, but that from
   their answering, "seven," the miracle might be noised abroad, and
   become more known in proportion to the smallness of the number.

   It goes on: "And He commanded the people to sit down on the ground."

   In the former feeding they lay down on grass, in this one on the
   ground.

   It continues, "And He took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and
   brake."

   In giving thanks, He has left us an example, that for all gifts
   conferred on us from heaven we should return thanks to Him. And it is
   to be remarked, that our Lord did not give the bread to the people, but
   to His disciples, and the disciples to the people.

   For it goes on, "and gave to His disciples to set before them; and they
   did set them before the people."

   And not only the bread, but the fish also He blessed, and ordered to be
   set before them.

   For there comes after, "And they had a few small fishes: and He
   blessed, and commanded to set them also before them."

   Bede: In this passage then we should notice, in one and the same, our
   Redeemer, a distinct operation of Divinity and of Manhood; thus the
   error of Eutyches [ed. note: i.e. the Monothelites], who presumes to
   lay down the doctrine of one only operation in Christ, is to be cast
   out far from the Christian pale. For who does not here see that the
   pity of our Lord for the multitude is the feeling and sympathy of
   humanity; and that at the same time His satisfying four thousand men
   with seven loaves and a few fishes, is a work of Divine virtue?

   It goes on, "And they took up of the broken meat that was left seven
   baskets."

   Theophylact: The multitudes who ate and were filled did not take with
   them the remains of the loaves, but the disciples took them up, and
   they did before the baskets. In which we learn according to the
   narration, that we should be content with what is sufficient, and not
   look for any thing beyond. The number of those who ate is put down,
   when it is said, "And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and
   He sent them away;" where we may see that Christ sends no one away
   fasting, for He wishes all to be nourished by His grace.

   Bede: The typical difference between this feeding and the other of the
   five loaves and two fishes, is, that there the letter of the Old
   Testament, full of spiritual grace, is signified, but here the truth
   and grace of the New Testament, which is to be ministered to all the
   faithful, is pointed out.

   Now the multitude remains three days, waiting for the Lord to heal
   their sick, as Matthew relates, when the elect, in the faith of the
   Holy Trinity, supplicate for sins, with persevering earnestness; or
   because they turn themselves to the Lord in deed, in word, and in
   thought.

   Theophylact: Or by those who wait for three days, He means the
   baptized; for baptism is called illumination, and is performed by true
   immersion.

   Greg., Mor. 1, 19: He does not however wish to dismiss them fasting,
   lest they should faint by the way; for it is necessary that men should
   find in what is preached the word of consolation, lest hungering
   through want of the food of truth, they sink under the toil of this
   life.

   Ambrose, in Luc., 6, 73: The good Lord indeed whilst He requires
   diligence, gives strength; nor will He dismiss them fasting, "lest they
   faint by the way," that is, either in the course of this life, or
   before they have reached the fountainhead of life, that is, the Father,
   and have learnt that Christ is of the Father, lest haply, after
   receiving that He is born of a virgin, they begin to esteem His virtue
   not that of God, but of a man.

   Therefore the Lord Jesus divides the food, and His will indeed is to
   give to all, to deny none; He is the Dispenser of all things, but if
   thou refusest to stretch forth thy hand to receive the food, thou wilt
   faint by the way; nor canst thou find fault with Him, who pities and
   divides.

   Bede: But they who return to repentance after the crimes of the flesh,
   after thefts, violence, and murders, come to the Lord from afar; for in
   proportion as a man has wandered farther in evil working, so he has
   wandered farther from Almighty God. The believers amongst the Gentiles
   came from afar to Christ, but the Jews from near, for they had been
   taught concerning Him by the letter of the law and the prophets. In the
   former case, however, of the feeding with five loaves, the multitude
   lay upon the green grass: here, however, upon the ground, because by
   the writing of the law, we are ordered to keep under the desires of the
   flesh, but in the New Testament we are ordered to leave even the earth
   itself and our temporal goods.

   Theophylact: Further, the seven loaves are spiritual discourses, for
   seven is the number, which points out the Holy Ghost, who perfects all
   things; for our life is perfected in the number of seven days. [ed.
   note: The number seven seems to be taken in the Fathers to mean a
   whole, from the world having been completed in seven days; and St.
   Ambrose lays it down as a principle of interpretation, in Luc. 7, 95.
   Theophylact here alludes to the seven ages of man's life; a very
   similar passage is found in St. Ambrose's 44th Letter, where the whole
   subject is discussed.]

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, the seven loaves are the gifts of the Holy
   Spirit, the fragments of the loaves are the mystical understanding of
   the first week.

   Bede: For our Lord's breaking the bread means the opening of mysteries;
   His giving of thanks shews how great a joy He feels in the salvation of
   the human race; His giving the loaves to His disciples that they might
   set them before the people, signifies that He assigns the spiritual
   gifts of knowledge to the Apostles, and that it was His will that by
   their ministry the food of life should be distributed to the Church.

   Pseudo-Jerome: The small fishes blessed are the books of the New
   Testament, for our Lord when risen asks for a piece of broiled fish.

   Or else, in these little fishes, we receive the saints, seeing that in
   the Scriptures of the New Testament are contained the faith, life, and
   sufferings of them who, snatched away from the troubled waves of this
   world, have given us by their example spiritual refreshment.

   Bede: Again, what was over and above, after the multitude was
   refreshed, the Apostles take up, because the higher precepts of
   perfection, to which the multitude cannot attain, belong to those whose
   life transcends that of the generality of the people of God;
   nevertheless, the multitude is said to have been satisfied, because
   though they cannot leave all that they possess, nor come up to that
   which is spoken of virgins, yet by listening to the commands of the law
   of God, they attain to everlasting life.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Again, the seven baskets are the seven Churches. By the
   four thousand is meant the year of the new dispensation, with its four
   seasons. Fitly also are there four thousand, that in the number itself
   it might be taught us that they were filled with the food of the
   Gospel.

   Theophylact: Or there are four thousand, that is, men perfect in the
   four virtues; and for this reason, as being more advanced, they ate
   more, and left fewer fragments. For in this miracle, seven baskets full
   remain, but in the miracle of the five loaves, twelve, for there were
   five thousand men, which means men enslaved to the five senses, and for
   this reason they could not eat, but were satisfied with little, and
   many remains of the fragments were over and above.
     __________________________________________________________________

   10. And straightway He entered into a ship with His disciples, and came
   into the parts of Dalmanutha.

   11. And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with Him,
   seeking of Him a sign from heaven, tempting Him.

   12. And He sighed deeply in His spirit, and saith, "Why doth this
   generation seek after a sign? Verily, I say unto you, there shall be no
   sign given unto this generation."

   13. And He left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the
   other side.

   14. Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in
   the ship with them more than one loaf.

   15. And He charged them, saying, "Take heed, beware of the leaven of
   the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod."

   16. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "It is because we have
   no bread."

   17. And when Jesus knew it, He saith unto them, "Why reason ye, because
   ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your
   heart yet hardened?

   18. Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye
   not remember?

   19. When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets
   full of fragments took ye up?" They say unto Him, "Twelve."

   20. "And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of
   fragments took ye up?" And they said, "Seven."

   21. And He said unto them, "How is it that ye do not understand?"
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After that our Lord had worked the miracle of the loaves,
   He immediately retires into another spot, lest on account of the
   miracle, the multitudes should take Him to make Him a king.

   Wherefore it is said, "And straightway He entered into a ship with His
   disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 2, 51: Now in Matthew we read that He entered
   into the parts of Magdala [ed. note: Magedam]. But we cannot doubt that
   it is the same place under another name; for several manuscripts even
   of St. Mark have only Magdala.

   It goes on, "And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with
   Him, seeking of Him a sign from heaven, tempting Him."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 33: The Pharisees, then, seek a sign from heaven,
   that He, Who had for the second time fed many thousands of men with a
   few loaves of bread, should now, after the example of Moses, refresh
   the whole nation in the last time with manna sent down from heaven, and
   dispersed amongst them all.

   Theophylact: Or they seek for a sign from heaven, that is, they wish
   Him to make the sun and moon stand still, to bring down hail, and
   change the atmosphere; for they thought that He could not perform
   miracles from heaven, but could only in Beelzebub perform a sign on
   earth.

   Bede: When, as related above, He was about to refresh the believing
   multitude, He gave thanks, so now, on account of the foolish petition
   of the Pharisees, He groans; because, bearing about with Him the
   feelings of human nature, as He rejoices over the salvation of men, so
   He grieves over their errors.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And He groaned in spirit, and saith, Why doth
   this generation seek after a sign? Verily I say unto you, If a sign
   shall be given to this generation."

   That is, no sign shall be given; as it is written in the Psalms, "I
   have sworn once by my holiness, if I shall fail David," [Ps 80:36] that
   is, I will not fail David.

   Augustine: Let no one, however, be perplexed that the answer which Mark
   says was given to them, when they sought a sign from heaven, is not the
   same as that which Matthew relates, namely, that concerning Jonah. He
   says that the Lord's answer was, that no sign should be given to it; by
   which we must understand such an one as they asked for, that is, one
   from heaven; but he has omitted to say, what Matthew has related.

   Theophylact: Now, the reason why the Lord did not listen to them was,
   that the time of signs from heaven had not arrived, that is, the time
   of the second Advent, when the powers of the heaven shall be shaken,
   and the moon shall not give her light. But in the time of the first
   Advent, all things are full of mercy, and such things do not take
   place.

   Bede: For a sign from heaven was not to be given to a generation of
   men, who tempted the Lord; but to a generation of men seeking the Lord,
   He shews a sign from heaven, when in the sight of the Apostles He
   ascended into heaven.

   It goes on, "And He left them, and entering into a ship again, He
   departed to the other side."

   Theophylact: The Lord indeed quits the Pharisees, as men uncorrected;
   for where there is a hope of correction, there it is right to remain;
   but where the evil is incorrigible, we should go away.

   There follows: "Now they had forgotten to take bread, neither had they
   in the ship with them more than one loaf."

   Bede: Some may ask, how they had no bread, when they had filled seven
   baskets just before they embarked in the ship. But Scripture relates
   that they had forgotten to take them with them, which is a proof how
   little care they had for the flesh in other things, since in their
   eagerness to follow the Lord, even the necessity of refreshing their
   bodies had escaped from their mind.

   Theophylact: By a special providence also the disciples forgot to take
   bread, that they might be blamed by Christ, and thus become better, and
   arrive at a knowledge of Christ's power.

   For it goes on, "And He charged them, saying, Take heed, and beware of
   the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Matthew says, "of the leaven
   of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees;" Luke, however, of the Pharisees
   only. All three, therefore, name the Pharisees, as being the most
   important of them, but Matthew and Mark have each mentioned one of the
   secondary sects; and fitly has Mark added "of Herod," as a supplement
   to Matthew's narrative, in which they were left out.

   But in saying this, He by degrees brings the disciples to understanding
   and faith.

   Theophylact: He means by leaven their hurtful and corrupt doctrine,
   full of the old malice, for the Herodians were the teachers, who said
   that Herod was the Christ.

   Bede: Or, the leaven of the Pharisees is making the decrees of the
   divine law inferior to the traditions of men, preaching the law in
   word, attacking it in deed, tempting the Lord, and disbelieving His
   doctrine and His works; but the leaven of Herod is adultery, murder,
   rash swearing, a pretence of religion, hatred to Christ and His
   forerunner.

   Theophylact: But the disciples themselves thought that the Lord spoke
   of the leaven of bread.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And they reasoned amongst themselves, saying, it
   is because we have no bread;" and this they said, as not understanding
   the power of Christ, who could make bread out of nothing; wherefore the
   Lord reproves them.

   For there follows: "And when Jesus knew it, He said unto them, Why
   reason ye because ye have no bread?"

   Bede: Taking occasion then from the precept, which He had commanded,
   saying, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of
   Herod," our Saviour teaches them what was the meaning of the five and
   the seven loaves, concerning which He adds, "And do ye not remember,
   when I brake the five loaves amongst five thousand, and how many
   baskets full of fragments ye took up?"

   For if the leaven mentioned above means perverse traditions, of course
   the food, with which the people of God was nourished, means the true
   doctrine.

   22. And He cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto Him,
   and besought Him to touch him.

   23. And He took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town;
   and when He had spit on his eyes, and put His hands upon him, He asked
   him if he saw ought.

   24. And he looked up and said, "I see men as trees, walking."

   25. After that He put His hands again upon his eyes, and made him look
   up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

   26. And He sent him away to his house, saying, "Neither go into the
   town, nor tell it to any in the town."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: After the feeding of the multitude, the Evangelist proceeds to
   the giving sight to the blind, saying, "And they came to Bethsaida, and
   they bring a blind man to Him, and besought Him to touch him."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 34: Knowing that the touch of the Lord could give
   sight to a blind man as well as cleanse a leper.

   It goes on, "And He took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of
   the town."

   Theophylact: For Bethsaida appears to have been infected with much
   infidelity, wherefore the Lord reproaches it, "Woe to thee, Bethsaida,
   for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre
   and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
   [Matt. 11, 21] He then takes out of the town the blind man, who had
   been brought to Him, for the faith of those who brought him was not
   true faith.

   It goes on, "And when He had spit in his eyes, and put His hands upon
   him, He asked him if he saw ought."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He spat indeed, and put His
   hand upon the blind man, because He wished to shew that wonderful are
   the effects of the Divine word added to action; for the hand is the
   symbol of working, but the spittle, of the word proceeding out of the
   mouth. Again He asked him whether he could see any thing, which He had
   not done in the case of any whom He had healed, thus shewing that by
   the weak faith of those who brought him, and of the blind man himself,
   his eyes could not altogether be opened.

   Wherefore there follows: "And He looked up, and said, I see men as
   trees walking;" because he was still under the influence of
   unfaithfulness, he said that he saw men obscurely.

   Bede: Seeing indeed the shapes of bodies amongst the shadows, but
   unable to distinguish the outlines of the limbs, from the continued
   darkness of his sight; just as trees standing thick together are wont
   to appear to men who see them from afar, or by the dim light of the
   night, so that it cannot easily be known whether they be trees or men.

   Theophylact: But the reason why he did not see at once perfectly, but
   in part, was, that he had not perfect faith; for healing is bestowed in
   proportion to faith.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: From the commencement,
   however, of the return of his senses, He leads him to apprehend things
   by faith, and thus makes him see perfectly; wherefore it goes on,
   "After that, He put His hands again upon his eyes, and he began to
   see," and afterwards he adds, "And he was restored, and saw all things
   clearly," that is, being perfectly healed in his senses and his
   intellect.

   It goes on, "And He sent him away to his house, saying, Go into thy
   home, and if thou enter into the town, tell it not to any one."

   Theophylact: These precepts He gave him, because they were unfaithful,
   as has been said, lest perchance he should receive hurt in his soul
   from them, and they by their unbelief should run into a more grievous
   crime.

   Bede: Or else, He leaves an example to His disciples that they should
   not seek for popular favour by the miracles which they did.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mystically, however, Bethsaida is interpreted, the house
   of the valley', that is, the world, which is the vale of tears. Again,
   they bring to the Lord a blind man, that is, one who neither sees what
   he has been, what he is, nor what he is to be. They ask Him to touch
   him, for what is being touched, but feeling compunction?

   Bede: For the Lord touches us, when He enlightens our minds with the
   breath of His Spirit, and He stirs us up that we may recognise our own
   infirmity, and be diligent in good actions. He takes the hand of the
   blind man, that He may strengthen him to the practice of good woks.

   Pseudo-Jerome: And He brings him out of the town, that is, out of the
   neighborhood of the wicked; and He puts spittle into his eyes, that he
   may see the will of God, by the breath of the Holy Ghost; and putting
   His hands upon him, He asked him if he could see, because by the works
   of the Lord His majesty is seen.

   Bede: Or else, putting spittle into the eyes of the blind man, He lays
   His hands upon him that he may see, because He has wiped away the
   blindness of the human race both by invisible gifts, and by the
   Sacrament of His assumed humanity; for the spittle, proceeding from the
   Head, points out the grace of the Holy Ghost. But though by one word He
   could cure the man wholly and all at once, still He cures him by
   degrees, that He may shew the greatness of the blindness of man, which
   can hardly, and only as it were step by step, be restored to light; and
   He exhibits to us His grace, by which He furthers each step towards
   perfection.

   Again, whoever is weighed down by a blindness of such long continuance,
   that he is unable to distinguish between good and evil, sees as it were
   men like trees walking, because he sees the deeds of the multitude
   without the light of discretion.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, he sees men as trees, because he thinks all men
   higher than himself. But He put His hands again upon his eyes, that he
   might see all things clearly, that is, understand invisible things by
   visible, and with the eye of a pure mind contemplate, what the eye hath
   not seen, the glorious state of his own soul after the rust of sin. He
   sent him to his home, that is, to his heart; that he might see in
   himself things which he had not seen before; for a man despairing of
   salvation does not think that he can do at all what, when enlightened,
   he can easily accomplish.

   Theophylact: Or else, after He has healed him, He sends him to his
   home; for the home of every one of us is heaven, and the mansions which
   are there.

   Pseudo-Jerome: And He says to him, "If thou enter into the town, tell
   it not to any one," that is, relate continually to thy neighbours thy
   blindness, but never tell them of thy virtue.

   27. And Jesus went out, and His disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
   Philippi: and by the way He asked His disciples, saying unto them,
   "Whom do me say that I am?"

   28. And they answered, "John the Baptist: but some say, Elias;' and
   others, One of the prophets.' "

   29. And He saith unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?" And Peter
   answereth and saith unto Him, "Thou art the Christ."

   30. And He charged them that they should tell no man of Him.

   31. And He began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
   things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and
   scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

   32. And He spake that saying openly. And Peter took Him, and began to
   rebuke Him.

   33. But when He had turned about and looked on His disciples, He
   rebuked Peter, saying, "Get thee behind Me, Satan: for thou savourest
   not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After taking His disciples afar from the Jews, He then
   asks them concerning Himself, that they might speak the truth without
   fear of the Jews.

   Wherefore it is said, "And Jesus entered, and His disciples, into the
   towns of Caesarea Philippi."

   Bede, in Marc., 2, 35: Philip was that brother of Herod, of whom we
   spoke above, who in honour of Tiberius Caesar called that town, which
   is now called Paneas, Caesarea Philippi.

   It goes on, "And by the way He asked His disciples, saying unto them,
   Whom do men say that I am?"

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He asks the question with a
   purpose, for it was right that His disciples should praise Him better
   than the crowd.

   Bede: Wherefore He first asks what is the opinion of men, in order to
   try the faith of the disciples, lest their confession should appear to
   be founded on the common opinion.

   It goes on, "And they answered, saying, Some say John the Baptist, some
   Elias, and others, One of the prophets."

   Theophylact: For many thought that John had risen from the dead, as
   even Herod believed, and that he had performed miracles after his
   resurrection. After however having enquired into the opinion of others,
   He asks them what was the belief of their own minds on this point.

   Wherefore it continues, "And He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I
   am?"

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 54: From the manner, however, itself of the
   question, He leads them to a higher feeling, and to higher thoughts,
   concerning Him, that they might not agree with the multitude. But the
   next words shew what the head of the disciples, the mouth of the
   Apostles, answered; when all were asked, "Peter answereth and saith
   unto Him, Thou art the Christ."

   Theophylact: He confesses indeed that He is the Christ announced by the
   Prophets; but the Evangelist Mark passes over what the Lord answered to
   his confession, and how He blessed him, lest by this way of relating
   it, he should seem to be favouring his master Peter; Matthew plainly
   goes through the whole of it.

   Origen, in Matt. Tom., 12, 15: Or else, Mark and Luke, as they wrote
   that Peter answered, "Thou art the Christ," without adding what is put
   down in Matthew, "the Son of the living God," so they omitted to relate
   the blessing which was conferred on this confession.

   It goes on, "And He charged them that they should tell no man of Him."

   Theophylact: For He wished in the meantime to hide His glory, lest many
   should be offended because of Him, and so earn a worse punishment.

   Chrys.: Or else, that He might wait to fix the pure faith in their
   minds, till the Crucifixion, which was an offence to them, was over,
   for after it was once perfected, about the time of His ascension, He
   said unto the Apostles, "Go ye and teach all nations."

   Theophylact: But after the Lord had accepted the confession of the
   disciples, who called Him the true God, He then reveals to them the
   mystery of the Cross.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And He began to teach them that the Son of man
   must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and of the chief
   priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
   again; and He spake that saying openly," that is, concerning His future
   passion.

   But His disciples did not understand the order of the truth, neither
   could they comprehend His resurrection, but thought it better that He
   should not suffer.

   Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: The reason, however, why the Lord
   told them this, was to shew, that after His cross and resurrection,
   Christ must be preached by His witnesses. Again, Peter alone, from the
   fervour of his disposition, had the boldness to dispute about these
   things.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And Peter took Him up, and began to rebuke Him."

   Bede: This, however, he speaks with the feelings of a man who loves and
   desires; as if he said, This cannot be, neither can mind ears receive
   that the Son of God is to be slain.

   Chrys.: But how is this, that Peter, gifted with a revelation from the
   Father, has so soon fallen, and become unstable? Surely, however, it
   was not wonderful that one who had received no revelation concerning
   the Passion should be ignorant of this. For that He was the Christ, the
   Son of the living God, he had learnt by revelation; but the mystery of
   His cross and resurrection had not yet been revealed to him. He
   Himself, however, shewing that He must come to His Passion, rebuked
   Peter.

   Wherefore there follows, "And when He had turned about and looked on
   His disciples, He rebuked Peter, &c."

   Theophylact: For the Lord, wishing to shew that His Passion was to take
   place on account of the salvation of men, and that Satan alone was
   unwilling that Christ should suffer, and the race of man be saved,
   called Peter Satan, because he savoured the things that were of Satan,
   and, from unwillingness that Christ should suffer, became His
   adversary; for Satan is interpreted the adversary.'

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But He saith not to the
   devil, when tempting Him, "Get thee behind me," but to Peter He saith,
   "Get thee behind me," that is, follow Me, and resist not the design of
   My voluntary Passion.

   There follows, "For thou savourest not the things which be of God, but
   which be of men."

   Theophylact: He says that Peter savours the things which be of men, in
   that he in some way savoured carnal affections, for Peter wished that
   Christ should spare Himself and not be crucified.
     __________________________________________________________________

   34. And when He had called the people unto Him with His disciples also,
   He said unto them, "Whosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself,
   and take up his cross, and follow Me.

   35. For whosoever will save his life shall lost it; but whosoever shall
   lose his life for My sake and the Gospel's, the same shall save it.

   36. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,
   and lost his own soul?

   37. Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

   38. Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of Me and of My words in this
   adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be
   ashamed, when He cometh in the glory of His Father with the holy
   angels."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: After shewing to His disciples the mystery of His passion and
   resurrection, He exorts them, as well as the multitude, to follow the
   example of His passion.

   Wherefore it goes on, "And when He had called the people unto Him with
   His disciples also, He said unto them, Whosoever wishes to come after
   Me, let him deny himself."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 55: As is He would say to Peter, Thou indeed
   dost rebuke Me, who am willing to undergo My passion, but I tell thee,
   that not only is it wrong to prevent Me from suffering, but neither
   canst thou be saved unless thou thyself diest.

   Again He says, "Whosoever wishes to come after Me;" as if He said, I
   call you to those good things which a man should wish for, I do not
   force you to evil and burdensome things; for he who does violence to
   his hearer, often stands in his way; but he who leaves him free, rather
   draws him to himself. And a man denies himself when he cares not for
   his body, so that whether it be scourged, or whatever of like nature it
   may suffer, he bears it patiently.

   Theophylact: For a man who denies another, be it brother or father,
   does not sympathize with him, nor grieve at his fate, though he be
   wounded and die; thus we ought to despise our body, so that if it
   should be wounded or hurt in any way, we should not mind its suffering.

   Chrys.: But He says not, a man should not spare himself, but what is
   more, that he should deny himself, as if he had nothing in common with
   himself, but face danger, and look upon such things as if another were
   suffering; and this is really to spare himself; for parents then most
   truly act kindly to their children, when they give them up to their
   masters, with an injunction not to spare them. Again, He shews the
   degree to which a man should deny himself, when He says, "And take up
   his cross," by which He means, even to the most shameful death.

   Theophylact: For at that time the cross appeared shameful, because
   malefactors were fixed to it.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, as a skilful pilot, foreseeing a storm in a
   calm, wishes his sailors to be prepared; so also the Lord says, "If any
   one will follow me, &c."

   Bede: For we deny ourselves, when we avoid what we were of old, and
   strive to reach that point, whither we are newly called. And the cross
   is taken up by us, when either our body is pained by abstinence, or our
   soul afflicted by fellow-feeling for our neighbour.

   Theophylact: But because after the cross we must have a new strength,
   He adds, "and follow me."

   Chrys.: And this He says, because it may happen that a man may suffer
   and yet not follow Christ, that is, when he does not suffer for
   Christ's sake; for he follows Christ, who walks after Him, and conforms
   himself to His death, despising those principalities and powers under
   whose power, before the coming of Christ, he committed sin.

   Then there follows, "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it;
   but whosoever shall lose his life for My sake and the Gospel's , the
   same shall save it."

   I give you these commands, as it were to spare you; for whosoever
   spares his son, brings him to destruction, but whosoever does not spare
   him, saves him. It is therefore right to be always prepared for death;
   for if in the battles of this world, he who is prepared for death
   fights better than others, though none can restore him to life after
   death, much more is this the case in spiritual battle, when so great a
   hope of resurrection is set before him, since he who gives up his soul
   unto death saves it.

   Remig.: And life is to be taken in this place for the present life, and
   not for the substance itself of the soul.

   Chrys.: And therefore He had said, "For whomsoever will save his life
   shall lose it," lest any one should suppose this loss to be equivalent
   to that salvation, He adds, "For what shall it profit a man, if he
   shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul, &c." As if He said,
   Think not that he has saved his soul, who has shunned the perils of the
   cross; for when a man, at the cost of his soul, that is, his life,
   gains the whole world, what has he besides, now that his soul is
   perishing? Has he another soul to give for his soul? For a man can give
   the price of his house in exchange for the house; but in losing his
   soul, he has not another soul to give. And it is with a purpose that He
   says, "Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" for God, in
   exchange for our salvation, has given the precious blood of Jesus
   Christ.

   Bede, in Marc. 2, 36: Or else He says this, because in time of
   persecution, our life is to be laid aside, but in time of peace, our
   earthly desires are to be broken, which He implies when He says, "For
   what shall it profit a man, &c."

   But we are often hindered by a habit of shamefacedness, from expressing
   with our voice the rectitude which we preserve in our hearts; and
   therefore it is added, "For whosoever shall confess Me and My words in
   this adulterous and sinful generation, him also shall the Son of man
   confess, when He cometh in the glory of His Father with the holy
   angels."

   Theophylact: For that faith which only remains in the mind is not
   sufficient, but the Lord requires also the confession of the mouth; for
   when the soul is sanctified by faith, the body ought also to be
   sanctified by confession.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He then who has learned
   this, is bound zealously to confess Christ without shame. And this
   generation is called adulterous, because it has left God the true
   Bridegroom of the soul, and has refused to follow the doctrine of
   Christ, but has prostrated itself to the devil and taken up the seeds
   of impiety, for which reason also it is called sinful. Whosoever
   therefore amongst them has denied the kingdom of Christ, and the words
   of God revealed in the Gospel, shall receive a reward befitting His
   impiety, when He hears in the second advent, "I know you not." [Matt
   7:23]

   Theophylact: Him then who shall leave confessed that his God was
   crucified, Christ Himself also shall confess, not here, where He is
   esteemed poor and wretched, but in His glory and with a multitude of
   Angels.

   Greg., Hom. in 32, in Evang.: There are however some, who confess
   Christ, because they see that all men are Christians; for if the name
   of Christ were not at this day in such great glory, the Holy Church
   would not have so many professors. The voice of the profession
   therefore is not sufficient for a trial of faith whilst the profession
   of the generality defends it from shame.

   In the time of peace therefore there is another way, by which we may be
   known to ourselves. We are ever fearful of being despised by our
   neighbours, we think it shame to bear injurious words; if perchance we
   have quarrelled with our neighbour, we blush to be the first to give
   satisfaction; for our carnal heart, in seeking the glory of this life,
   disdains humility.

   Theophylact: But because He had spoken of His glory, in order to shew
   that His promises were not vain, He subjoins, "Verily I say unto you,
   That there be some of them that stand here who shall not taste of
   death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power."

   As if He said, Some, that is, Peter, James, and John, shall not taste
   of death, until I shew them, in my transfiguration, with what glory I
   am to come in my second advent; for the transfiguration was nothing
   else, but an announcement of the second coming of Christ, in which also
   Christ Himself and the Saints will shine.

   Bede, in Marc., 3, 36: Truly it was done with a loving foresight, in
   order that they, having tasted for a brief moment the contemplation of
   everlasting joy, might with the greater strength bear up under
   adversity.

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 56: And He did not declare the names of those
   who were about to go up, lest the other disciples should feel some
   touch of human frailty, and He tells it to them beforehand, that they
   might come with minds better prepared to be taught all that concerned
   that vision.

   Bede: Or else the present Church is called the kingdom of God; and some
   of the disciples were to live in the body until they should see the
   Church built up, and raised against the glory of the world; for it was
   right to make some promises concerning this life to the disciples who
   were uninstructed, that they might be built up with greater strength
   for the time to come.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Orig. in Matt. tom., 12, 33, 35: But in a mystical
   sense, Christ is life, and the devil is death, and he tastes of death,
   who dwells in sin; even now every one, according as he has good or evil
   doctrines, tastes the bread either of life or of death. And indeed, it
   is a less evil to see death, a greater to taste of it, still worse to
   follow it, worst of all to be subject to it.

Chapter 9

   1. And He said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, That there be some of
   them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have
   seen the kingdom of God come with power."

   2. And after six days Jesus taketh with Him, Peter and James and John,
   and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and He
   was transfigured before them.

   3. And His raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no
   fuller on earth can white them.

   4. And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking
   with Jesus.

   5. And Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to
   be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for Thee, and one for
   Moses, and one for Elias."

   6. For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

   7. And there was a cloud that overshadowed them; and a voice came out
   of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son: hear Him."

   8. And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any
   more, save Jesus only with themselves.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: After the consummation of the cross, the glory of the
   resurrection is shewn, that they, who were to see with their own eyes
   the glory of the resurrection to come, might not fear the shame of the
   cross.

   Wherefore it is said, "And after six days Jesus taketh with Him, Peter
   and James and John, and led them up into an high mountain apart by
   themselves, and He was transfigured before them."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt. 65: Luke in saying , "After eight days," does not
   contradict this; for he reckoned in both the day on which Christ had
   spoken what goes before, and the day on which He took them up. And the
   reason that He took them up after six days, was that they might be
   filled with a more eager desire during the space of these days, and
   with a watchful and anxious mind attend to what they saw.

   Theophylact: And He takes with Him the three chief of the Apostles,
   Peter, as confessing and loving Him, John, as the beloved one, James,
   as being sublime in speech and as a divine; for so displeasing was he
   to the Jews, that Herod wishing to please the Jews slew him.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He does not however shew His
   glory in a house, but He takes them up into a high mountain, for the
   loftiness of the mountain was adapted to shewing forth the loftiness of
   His glory.

   Theophylact: And He took them apart, because He was about to reveal
   mysteries to them. We must also understand by transfiguration not the
   change of His features, but that, whilst His features remained as
   before, there was added unto Him a certain ineffable brightness.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: It is not therefore fitting
   that in the kingdom of God any change of feature should take place,
   either in the Saviour Himself, or in those who are to be made like unto
   Him, but only an addition of brightness.

   Bede, 3, 37: Our Saviour then when transfigured did not lose the
   substance of real flesh, but shewed forth the glory of His own or of
   our future resurrection; for such as He then appeared to the Apostles,
   He will after the judgment appear to all His elect.

   It goes on, "And His raiment became shining."

   Greg., Mor. 32: Because, in the height of the brightness of heaven
   above, they who shine in righteousness of life, will cling to Him; for
   by the name of garments, He means the just whom He joins to Himself.

   There follows, "And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses, and they
   were talking with Jesus."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 56: He brings Moses and Elias before them;
   first, indeed, because the multitudes said that Christ was Elias, and
   one of the Prophets. He shews Himself to the Apostles with them, that
   they might see the difference between the Lord, and His servants.

   And again because the Jews accused Christ of transgressing the law, and
   thought Him a blasphemer, as if He arrogated to Himself the glory of
   His Father, He brought before them those who shone conspicuous in both
   ways; for Moses gave the Law, and Elias was zealous for the glory of
   God; for which reason neither would have stood near Him, if He had been
   opposed to God and to His law.

   And that they might know that He holds the power of life and of death,
   He brings before them both Moses who was dead, and Elias who had not
   yet suffered death. Furthermore He signified by this that the doctrine
   of the Prophets was the schoolmaster to the doctrine of Christ. He also
   signified the junction of the New and Old Testament, and that the
   Apostles shall be joined in the resurrection with the Prophets, and
   both together shall go forth to meet their common King.

   It goes on, "And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good
   for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and
   one for Moses, and one for Elias."

   Bede: If the transfigured humanity of Christ and the society of but two
   saints seen for a moment, could confer delight to such a degree that
   Peter would, even by serving them, stay their departure, how great a
   happiness will it be to enjoy the vision of Deity amidst choirs of
   Angels forever?

   It goes on, "For he wist not what to say;" although, however, Peter
   from the stupor of human frailty knew not what to say, still he gives a
   proof of the feelings which were within him; for the cause of his not
   knowing what to say, was his forgetting that the kingdom was promised
   to the Saints by the Lord not in any earthly region, but in heaven; he
   did not remember that he and his fellow Apostles were still hemmed in
   by mortal flesh and could not bear the state of immortal life, to which
   his soul had already carried him away, because in our Father's house in
   heaven, a house made with hands is not needed.

   But again even up to this time he is pointed at, as an ignorant man,
   who wishes to make three tabernacles for the Law, the Prophets, and the
   Gospel, since they in no way can be separated from each other.

   Chrys. [ed. note: This passage is found neither in St. Chrysostom, nor
   in Possious' Catena, nor in Peitanus' translation of Victor: it is
   however in the Catena of St. Mark, edited by Dr. Cramer. As it stands
   in the text, a part of it is so unintelligible, that recourse has been
   had to the Greek.]

   Again, Peter neither comprehended that the Lord worked His
   transfiguration for the shewing forth of His true glory, nor that He
   did this in order to teach men, nor that it was impossible for them to
   leave the multitude and dwell in the mountain.

   It goes on, "For they were sore afraid."

   But this fear of theirs was one by which they were raised from their
   usual state of mind to one higher, and they recognised that those who
   appeared to them were Moses and Elias. The soul also was drawn on to a
   state of heavenly feeling, as though carried away from human sense by
   the heavenly vision.

   Theophylact: Or else, Peter, fearing to come down from the mount
   because he had now a presentiment that Christ must be crucified, said,
   "It is good for us to be here," and not to go down there, that is, in
   the midst of the Jews; but if they who are furious against Thee come
   hither, we have Moses who beat down the Egyptians, we have also Elias,
   who brought fire down from heaven and destroyed the five hundred.

   Origen, in Matt. tom. 12, 40: Mark says in his own person, "For he wist
   not what to say." Where it is matter for consideration, whether
   perchance Peter spoke this in the confusion of his mind, by the motion
   of a spirit not his own; whether perchance that spirit himself who
   wished, as far as in him lay, to be a stumbling block to Christ, so
   that He might shrink from that Passion, which was the saving of all
   men, did not here work as a seducer and wish under the colour of good
   to prevent Christ from condescending to men, from coming to them, and
   taking death upon Himself for their sakes.

   Bede: Now because Peter sought for a material tabernacle, he was
   covered with the shadow of the cloud, that he might learn that in the
   resurrection they are to be protected not by the covering of houses,
   but by the glory of the Holy Ghost.

   Wherefore it goes on, "There was a cloud that overshadowed them."

   And the reason why they obtained no answer from the Lord was that they
   asked unadvisedly; but the Father answered for the Son.

   Wherefore there follows, "And a voice came out of the cloud, saying,
   This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 56: The voice proceeded from a cloud in which
   God is wont to appear, that they might believe that the voice was sent
   forth from God. But in that He says, "This is My beloved Son," He
   declares that the will of the Father and the Son is one, and that, save
   in that He is the Son, He is in all things One with Him who begot Him.

   Bede: He then whose preaching, as Moses foretold, every soul that
   wished to be saved should hear when He came in the flesh, He now come
   in the flesh is proclaimed by God the Father to the disciples as the
   one whom they were to hear.

   There follows: "And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they
   saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves;" for as soon as
   the Son was proclaimed, at once the servants disappeared, lest the
   voice of the Father should seem to have been sent forth to them.

   Theophylact: Again, mystically; after the end of this world, which was
   made in six days, Jesus will take us up (if we be His disciples) into
   an high mountain, that is, into heaven, where we shall see His
   exceeding glory.

   Bede: And by the garments of the Lord are meant His saints, who will
   shine with a new whiteness. By the fuller we must understand Him, to
   whom the Psalmist says, "Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and
   cleanse me from my sin;" [Ps 51] for He cannot give to His faithful
   ones upon earth that glory which remains laid up for them in heaven.

   Remig.: Or else, by the fuller are meant holy preachers and purifiers
   of the soul, none of whom in this life can so live as not to be stained
   with some spots of sin; but in the coming resurrection all the saints
   shall be purged from every stain of sin. Therefore the Lord will make
   them such as neither they themselves by taking vengeance on their own
   members, nor any preacher by his example and doctrine, can make.

   Chrys.: Or else, white garments are the writings of Evangelists and
   Apostles, the like to which no interpreter can frame.

   Origen, in Matt. tom. 12, 39: Or else, fullers upon earth may by a
   moral interpretation be considered to be the wise of this world, who
   are thought to adorn even their foul understandings and doctrines with
   a false whitening drawn from their own minds. But their skill as
   fullers cannot produce any thing like a discourse which shews forth the
   brightness of spiritual conceptions in the unpolished words of
   Scripture, which by many are despised.

   Bede: Moses and Elias, of whom one, as we read, died, the other was
   carried away to heaven, signify the coming glory of all the Saints,
   that is, of all who in the judgment time are either to be found alive
   in the flesh, or to be raised up from that death of which they tasted,
   and who are all equally to reign with Him.

   Theophylact: Or else it means, that we are to see in glory both the Law
   and the Prophets speaking with Him, that is, we shall then find that
   all those things which were spoken of Him by Moses and the other
   prophets agree with the reality; then too we shall hear the voice of
   the Father, revealing to us the Son of the Father, and saying, "This is
   My beloved Son," and the cloud, that is, the Holy Ghost, the fount of
   truth, will overshadow us.

   Bede: And we must observe, that, as when the Lord was baptized in
   Jordan, so on the mountain, covered with brightness, the whole mystery
   of the Holy Trinity is declared, because we shall see in the
   resurrection that glory of the Trinity which we believers confess in
   baptism, and shall praise it all together.

   Nor is it without reason that the Holy Ghost appeared here in a bright
   cloud, there in the form of a dove; because he who now with a simple
   heart keeps the faith which he hath embraced, shall then contemplate
   what he had believed with the brightness of open vision. But when the
   voice had been heard over the Son, He was found Himself alone, because
   when He shall have manifested Himself to His elect, God shall be all in
   all, yea Christ with His own, as the Head with the body, shall shine
   through all things. [1 Cor 15:28]

   9. And as they came down from the mountain, He charged them that they
   should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were
   risen from the dead.

   10. And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with
   another what the rising from the dead should mean.

   11. And they asked Him, saying, "Why say the Scribes that Elias must
   first come?"

   12. And He answered and told them, "Elias verily cometh first, and
   restoreth all things: and how it is written of the Son of man, that He
   must suffer many things, and be set at nought.

   13. But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done
   unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Origen, in Matt. tom. 12, 43: After the shewing of the mystery on the
   mount, the Lord commanded His disciples, as they were coming down from
   the mount, not to reveal His transfiguration, before the glory of His
   Passion and Resurrection.

   Wherefore it is said, "And as they came down from the mountain, He
   charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen,
   till the Son of man were risen from the dead."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 56: Where He not only orders them to be silent,
   but mentioning His Passion, He implies the cause why they were to be
   silent.

   Theophylact: Which He did lest men should be offended, hearing such
   glorious things of Him Whom they were about to see crucified. It was
   not therefore fitting to say such things of Christ before He suffered,
   but after His resurrection they were likely to be believed.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: But they, being ignorant of
   the mystery of the resurrection, took hold of that saying, and disputed
   one with another.

   Wherefore there follows, "And they kept that saying with themselves,
   questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should
   mean."

   Pseudo-Jerome: This, which is peculiar to Mark, means, that when death
   shall have been swallowed up in victory, we shall have no memory for
   the former things.

   It goes on, "And they asked Him, saying, "Why say the Scribes that
   Elias must first come?"

   Chrys.: The design of the disciples in asking this question seems to me
   to be this. We indeed have seen Elias with Thee, and have seen Thee
   before seeing Elias, but the Scribes say that Elias cometh first; we
   therefore believe that they have lied.

   Bede: Or thus; the disciples thought that the change which they had
   seen in Him in the mount, was His transformation to glory; and they
   say, If Thou hast already come in glory, wherefore doth not Thy
   forerunner appear? chiefly because they had seen Elias go away.

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt. 57: But what Christ answered to this, is seen by
   what follows, "And He answered and told them, Elias verily cometh
   first, and restoreth all things;" in which He shews that Elias will
   come before His second advent. For the Scriptures declare two advents
   of Christ, namely, one which has taken place, and another which is to
   come; but the Lord asserts that Elias is the forerunner of the second
   advent.

   Bede: Again, He will restore all things, that is to say, those things
   which Malachi points out, saying, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the
   prophet, and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
   and the heart of the children to their fathers;" [Mal 4:5-6] he will
   yield up also to death that debt, which by his prolonged life he has
   delayed to render.

   Theophylact: Now the Lord puts this forward to oppose the notion of the
   Pharisees, who held that Elias was the forerunner of the first advent,
   shewing that it led them to a false conclusion; wherefore he subjoins,
   "And how it is written of the Son of man, that He must suffer many
   things, and be set at nought." As if He had said, When Elias the
   Tishbite cometh, he will pacify the Jews, and will bring them to the
   faith, and thus be the forerunner of the second advent.

   If then Elias is the forerunner of the first advent, how is it written
   that the Son of man must suffer? One of these two things therefore will
   follow; either that Elias is not the forerunner of the first advent,
   and thus the Scripture will be true; or that he is the forerunner of
   the first advent, and then the Scripture will not be true, which say
   that Christ must suffer; for Elias must restore all things, in which
   case there will not be an unbelieving Jew, but all, whosoever hear him,
   must believe on his preaching.

   Bede: Or this, "And how it is written;" that is, in the same way as the
   prophets have written many things in various places concerning the
   Passion of Christ, Elias also, when he comes, is to suffer many things,
   and to be despised by the wicked.

   Chrys.: Now as the Lord asserted that Elias was to be the forerunner of
   the second advent, so consequently He asserted that John was the
   forerunner of the first.

   Wherefore He subjoins, "But I say unto you, that Elias is indeed come."

   Gloss.: He calls John Elias, not because he was Elias in person, but
   because he fulfilled the ministry of Elias; for as the latter will be
   the forerunner of the second advent, so the former has been that of the
   first.

   Theophylact: For again, John rebuked vice, and was a zealous man, and a
   hermit like Elias; but they heard him not, as they will hear Elias, but
   killed him in wicked sport, and cut off his head.

   Wherefore there follows, "And they have done unto him whatsoever they
   listed, as it is written of him."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else, the disciples asked
   Jesus, how it was written that the Son of man must suffer? Now in
   answer to this, He says, As John came in the likeness of Elias, and
   they evil intreated him, so according to the Scriptures must the Son of
   man suffer.

   14. And when He came to His disciples, He saw a great multitude about
   them, and the Scribes questioning with them.

   15. And straightway all the people, when they beheld Him, were greatly
   amazed, and running to Him saluted Him.

   16. And He asked the Scribes, "What question ye with them?"

   17. And one of the multitude answered and said, "Master, I have brought
   unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;

   18. And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and
   gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples
   that they should cast him out; and they could not."

   19. He answereth him, and saith, "O faithless generation, how long
   shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto Me."

   20. And they brought him unto Him: and when He saw him, straightway the
   spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.

   21. And He asked his father, "How long is it ago since this came unto
   him?" And he said, "Of a child.

   22. And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters,
   to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us,
   and help us."

   23. Jesus said unto him, "If thou canst believe, all things are
   possible to him that believeth."

   24. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with
   tears, "Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief."

   25. When Jesus saw that the people came running together, He rebuked
   the foul spirit, saying unto him, "Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge
   thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him."

   26. And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and
   he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, "He is dead."

   27. But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.

   28. And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
   privately, "Why could not we cast him out?"

   29. And He said unto them, "This kind can come forth by nothing, but by
   prayer and fasting."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After He had shewn His glory in the mount to the three
   disciples, He returns to the other disciples, who had not come up with
   Him into the mount; wherefore it is said, "And when He came to His
   disciples, He saw a great multitude about them, and the Scribes
   questioning with them."

   For the Pharisees, catching the opportunity of the hour when Christ was
   not present, came up to them, to try to draw them over to themselves.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But there is no peace for man under the sun; envy is
   ever slaying the little ones, and lightnings strike the tops of the
   great mountains. Of all those who run to the Church, some as the
   multitudes come in faith to learn, others, as the Scribes, with envy
   and pride.

   It goes on, "And straightway all the people, when they beheld Jesus,
   were greatly amazed, and feared."

   Bede, in Marc., 3, 38: In all cases, the difference between the mind of
   the Scribes and of the people ought to be observed; for the Scribes are
   never said to have shewn any devotion, faith, humility, and reverence,
   but as soon as the Lord was come, the whole multitude was greatly
   amazed and feared, and ran up to Him, and saluted Him; wherefore there
   follows, "And running to Him, saluted Him."

   Theophylact: For the multitude was glad to see Him, so that they
   saluted Him from afar, as He was coming to them; but some suppose that
   His countenance had become more beautiful from His transfiguration, and
   that this induced the crowd to salute Him.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Now it was the people, and not the disciples, who on
   seeing Him were amazed and feared, for there is no fear in love; fear
   belongs to servants, amazement to fools.

   It goes on: "And He asked them, What question ye with them?"

   Why does the Lord put this question? That confession may produce
   salvation, and the murmuring of our hearts may be appeased by religious
   works.

   Bede: The question, indeed, which was raised may, if I am not deceived,
   have been this, wherefore they, who were the disciples of the Saviour,
   were unable to heal the demoniac, who was placed in the midst, which
   may be gathered from the following words; "And one of the multitude
   answered and said, "Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath
   a dumb spirit; and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he
   foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away."

   Chrys.: The Scriptures declare that this man was weak in faith, for
   Christ says, "O faithless generation:" and He adds, "If thou canst
   believe."

   But although his want of faith was the cause of their not casting out
   the devil, he nevertheless accuses the disciples.

   Wherefore it is added, "And I spake to thy disciples that they should
   cast him out; but they could not."

   Now observe his folly; in praying to Jesus in the midst of the crowd,
   he accuses the disciples, wherefore the Lord before the multitude so
   much the more accuses him, and not only aims the accusation at himself,
   but also extends it to all the Jews; for it is probable that many of
   those present had been offended, and had held wrong thoughts concerning
   His disciples.

   Wherefore there follows, "He answereth them and saith, O faithless
   generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?"
   By which He shewed both that He desired death, and that it was a burden
   to Him to converse with them.

   Bede: So far, however, is He from being angry with the person, though
   He reproved the sin, that He immediately added, "Bring him unto Me; and
   they brought him unto Him. And when He saw him, straightway the spirit
   tare him, and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming."

   Chrys.: But this the Lord permitted for the sake of the father of the
   boy, that when he saw the devil vexing his child, he might be brought
   on to believe that the miracle was to be wrought.

   Theophylact: He also permits the child to be vexed, that in this way we
   might know the devil's wickedness, who would have killed him, had he
   not been assisted by the Lord.

   It goes on: "And He asked his father, How long is it ago since this
   come unto him? And he said, Of a child; and ofttimes it has cast him
   into the fire and into the waters to destroy him."

   Bede: Let Julian [ed. note: Julian was bishop of Eclanum in Campania;
   he was well known to St. Augustine, who before his fall speaks of him
   with great affection. On refusing however to agree to Pope Zosimus'
   condemnation of Pelagius, he was deposed, and expelled from Italy. He
   wrote a great deal against St. Augustine, by whom he was refuted in
   works now extant. The opinion specially referred to in the text was,
   that Adam would have died, even though he had remained innocent, and
   therefore that death and sickness are not the consequences of original
   sin. He died in Sicily in great poverty, about A.D. 453.] blush, who
   dares to say that all men are born in the flesh without the infection
   of sin, as though they were innocent in all respects, just as Adam was
   when he was created.

   For what was there in the boy, that he should be troubled from infancy
   with a cruel devil, if he were not held at all by the chain of original
   sin? since it is evident that he could not yet have had any sin of his
   own.

   Gloss.: Now he expresses in the words of his petition his want of
   faith; for that is the reason why he adds, "But if thou canst do any
   thing, have compassion on us, and help us."

   For in that he says, "If thou canst do any thing," he shews that he
   doubts His power, because he had seen that the disciples of Christ had
   failed in curing him; but he says, "have compassion on us," to shew the
   misery of the sons, who suffered, and the father, who suffered with
   him.

   It goes on: "Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are
   possible to him that believeth."

   Pseudo-Jerome: This saying, "If thou canst," is a proof of the freedom
   of the will. Again, all things are possible to him that believeth,
   which evidently means all those things which are prayed for with tears
   in the name of Jesus, that is, of salvation.

   Bede: The answer of the Lord was suited to the petition; for the man
   said, "If thou canst do any thing, help us;" and to this the Lord
   answered, "If thou canst believe." On the other hand, the leper who
   cried out, with faith, "Lord, if Thou will, Thou canst make me clean,"
   [Matt 8:2] received an answer according to his faith, "I will, be thou
   clean."

   Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: His meaning is; such a plenitude of
   virtue is there in Me, that not only can I do this, but I will make
   others to have that power; wherefore if thou canst believe as thou
   oughtest to do, thou shalt be able to cure not only him, but many more.
   In this way then, He endeavoured to bring back to the faith, the man
   who as yet speaks unfaithfully.

   There follows, "And straightway the father of the child cried out, and
   said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."

   But if he had already believed, saying, "I believe," how is it that he
   adds, "help thou mine unbelief?" We must say then that faith is
   manifold, that one sort of faith is elementary, another perfect; but
   this man, being but a beginner in believing, prayed the Saviour to add
   to his virtue what was wanting.

   Bede: For no man at once reaches to the highest point, but in holy
   living a man begins with the least things that he may reach the great;
   for the beginning of virtue is different from the progress and the
   perfection of it. Because then faith mounts up through the secret
   inspiration of grace, by the steps of its own merits, [ed. note: This
   sentence of Bede may be considered to be an exposition of our Lord's
   words: "for he that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he
   hath." The connection between grace and merit, as used by the Fathers,
   may be illustrated from St. Thomas, their faithful disciple. He defines
   a meritorious operation to be one the reward of which is beyond the
   nature of the worker; so that merit implies the infusion of a
   supernatural habit, that is, of grace, not only as its efficient, but
   as its formal cause. Summa 1 Q62, Art 4] he who had not yet believed
   perfectly was at once a believer and an unbeliever.

   Pseudo-Jerome: By this also we are taught that our faith is tottering,
   if it lean not on the stay of the help of God. But faith by its tears
   receives the accomplishment of its wishes.

   Wherefore it continues, "When Jesus saw that the multitude came running
   together, He rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and
   deaf spirit, I charge thee come out of him, and enter no more into
   him."

   Theophylact: The reason that He rebuked the foul spirit, when He saw
   the crowd running together, was that He did not wish to cure him before
   the multitude, that He might give us a lesson to avoid ostentation.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: And His rebuking him, and
   saying, "I charge thee," is a proof of Divine power. Again, in that He
   says not only, "come out of him," but also "enter no more into him," He
   shews that the evil spirit was ready to enter again, because the man
   was weak in faith, but was prevented by the commend of the Lord.

   It goes on, "And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of
   him; and he was as one dead, insomuch that many said, He is dead."

   For the devil was not able to inflict death upon him, because the true
   Life was come.

   Bede: But him, whom the unholy spirit made like unto death, the holy
   Saviour saved by the touch of His hold hand; wherefore it goes on, "But
   Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up, and he arose."

   Thus as the Lord had shewn Himself to be very God by the power of
   healing, so He shewed that He had the very nature of our flesh, by the
   manner of His human touch. The Manichaean [ed. note: "Their fundamental
   maxim of the intrinsic evil of matter and the degraded state of mind,
   which their speculations on the birth after the flesh brought with it
   involved the denial of the Incarnation of our Lord and, as a
   consequence, of the reality of His whole life." (Note a, upon St.
   Augustine's Confessions, Oxf. Tr. p. 325)] indeed madly denies that He
   was truly clothed in flesh; He Himself, however, by raising, cleansing,
   enlightening so many afflicted persons by His touch, condemned his
   heresy before its birth.

   It goes on: "And when He was come into the house, His disciples asked
   Him privately, Why could not we cast him out?"

   Chrys.: They feared that perchance they had lost the grace conferred
   upon them; for they had already received power over unclean spirits.

   It goes on: "And He said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing
   but by prayer and fasting."

   Theophylact: That is, the whole class of lunatics, or simply, of all
   persons possessed with devils. Both the man to be cured, and he who
   cures him, should fast; for a real prayer is offered up, when fasting
   is joined with prayer, when he who prays is sober and not heavy with
   food.

   Bede: Again, in a mystical sense, on high the Lord unfolds the
   mysteries of the kingdom to His disciples, but below He rebukes the
   multitude for their sins of unfaithfulness, and expels devils from
   those who are vexed by them. Those who are still carnal and foolish, He
   strengthens, teaches, punishes, whilst He more freely instructs the
   perfect concerning the things of eternity.

   Theophylact: Again, this devil is deaf and dumb; deaf, because he does
   not choose to hear the words of God; dumb, because he is unable to
   teach others their duty.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Again, a sinner foameth forth folly, gnasheth with
   anger, pineth away in sloth. But the evil spirit tears him, when coming
   to salvation, and in like manner those whom he would drag into his maw
   he tears asunder by terrors and losses, as he did Job.

   Bede: For oftentimes when we try to turn to God after sin, our old
   enemy attacks us with new and greater snares, which he does, either to
   instill into us a hatred of virtue, or to avenge the injury of his
   expulsion.

   Greg., Mor. x., 30: But he who is freed from the power of the evil
   spirit is thought to be dead; for whosoever has already subdued earthly
   desires, puts to death within himself his carnal mode of life, and
   appears to the world as a dead man, and many look upon him as dead; for
   they who know not how to live after the Spirit, think that he who does
   not follow after carnal pleasures is altogether dead.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Further, in his being vexed from his infancy, the
   Gentile people is signified, from the very birth of whom the vain
   worship of idols arose, so that they in their folly sacrificed their
   children to devils. And for this reason it is said that "it cast him
   into the fire and into the water;" for some of the Gentiles worshipped
   fire, others water.

   Bede: Or by this demoniac are signified those who are bound by the
   guilt of original sin, and coming into the world as criminals, are to
   be saved by grace; and by fire is meant the heat of anger, by water,
   the pleasures of the flesh, which melt the soul by their sweetness.

   But He did not rebuke the boy, who suffered violence, but the devil,
   who inflicted it, because he who desires to amend a sinner, ought,
   whilst he exterminates his vice by rebuking and cursing it, to love and
   cherish the man.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Again, the Lord applies to the evil spirit what he had
   inflicted on the man, calling him a "deaf and dumb spirit," because he
   never will hear and speak what the penitent sinner can speak and hear.
   But the devil, quitting a man, never returns, if the man keep his heart
   with the keys of humility and charity, and hold possession of the gate
   of freedom [ed. note: of "fastness".]. The man who was healed became as
   one dead, for it is said to those who are healed, "Ye are dead, and
   your life is hid with Christ in God."

   Theophylact: Again, when Jesus, that is, the word of the Gospel, takes
   hold of the hand, that is, of our powers of action, then shall we be
   freed from the devil. And observe that God first helps us, then it is
   required of us that we do good; for which reason it is said that Jesus
   "raised him;" in which is shewn the aid of God, and that "he arose," in
   which is declared the zeal of man.

   Bede: Further, our Lord, while teaching the Apostles how the worst
   devil is to be expelled, gives all of us rules for our life; that is,
   He would have us know that all the more grievous attacks of evil
   spirits or of men are to be overcome by fastings and prayers; and
   again, that the anger of the Lord, when it is kindled for vengeance on
   our crimes, can be appeased by this remedy alone.

   But fasting in general is not only abstinence from food, but also from
   all carnal delights, yea, from all vicious passions. In like manner,
   prayer taken generally consists not only in the words by which we call
   upon the Divine mercy, but also in all those things which we do with
   the devotedness of faith in obedience to our Maker, as the Apostle
   testifies, when he says, "Pray without ceasing." [Thes 5:17]

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, the folly which is connected with the softness
   of the flesh, is healed by fasting; anger and laziness are healed by
   prayer. Each would has its own medicine, which must be applied to it;
   that which is used for the heel will not cure the eye; by fasting, the
   passions of the body, by prayer, the plagues of the soul, are healed.

   30. And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and He would
   not that any man should know it.

   31. For He taught He disciples, and said unto them, "The Son of man is
   delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill Him; and after
   that He is killed, He shall rise the third day."

   32. But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask Him.

   33. And He came to Capernaum: and being in the house He asked them,
   "What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?"

   34. But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among
   themselves, who should be the greatest.

   35. And He sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, "If
   any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant
   of all."

   36. And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when He
   had taken him in His arms, He said unto them,

   37. "Whosoever shall receive one of such children in My name, receiveth
   Me: and whosoever shall receive Me, receiveth not Me, but Him that sent
   Me."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: It is after miracles that the Lord inserts a discourse
   concerning His Passion, lest it should be thought that He suffered
   because He could not help it.

   Wherefore it is said, "And they departed thence, and passed through
   Galilee; and He would not that any man should know it. For He taught
   His disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the
   hands of men, and they shall kill Him."

   Bede, in Marc., 1, 39: He always mingles together sorrowful and joyful
   things, that sorrow should not by its suddenness frighten the Apostles,
   but be borne by them with prepared minds.

   Theophylact: After, however, saying what was sorrowful, He adds what
   ought to rejoice them; wherefore it goes on: "And after that He is
   killed, He shall rise the third day;" in order that we may learn that
   joys come on after struggles.

   There follows: "But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to
   ask Him."

   Bede: This ignorance of the disciples proceeds not so much from
   slowness of intellect, as from love for the Saviour, for they were as
   yet carnal, and ignorant of the mystery of the cross, they could not
   therefore believe that He whom they had recognized as the true God, was
   about to die; being accustomed then to hear Him often talk in figures,
   and shrinking from the events of His death, they would have it that
   something was conveyed figuratively in those things, which He spoke
   openly concerning His betrayal and passion.

   It goes on: "And they came to Capernaum."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Capernaum means the city of consolation, and agrees with
   the former sentence, which He had spoken: "And after that He is killed,
   He shall arise the third day."

   There follows: "And being in the house He asked them, What was it that
   ye disputed among yourselves by the way? But they held their peace."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Matthew however says that
   the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the greatest in the
   kingdom of heaven?" [Matt 18:1]

   The reason is, that He did not begin the narrative from its
   commencement, but omitted our Saviour's knowledge of the thoughts and
   words of His disciples; unless we understand Him to mean, that even
   what they thought and said, when away from Christ, was said unto Him,
   since it was as well known to Him as if it had been said to Him.

   It goes on: "For by the way they had disputed among themselves, who
   should be the greatest."

   But Luke says [ed. note: Luke 9:46, Vulgate] that "the thought entered
   into the disciples which of them should be the greatest;" for the Lord
   laid open their thought and intention from their private discourse
   according to the Gospel narrative.

   Pseudo-Jerome: It was fit also that they should dispute concerning the
   chief place by the way; the dispute is like the place where it is held;
   for lofty station is only entered upon to be quitted: as long as a man
   keeps it, it is slippery, and it is uncertain at what stage, that is,
   on what day, it will end.

   Bede: The reason why the dispute concerning the chief place arose
   amongst the disciples seems to have been, that Peter, James and John,
   were led apart from the rest into the mountain, and that something
   secret was there entrusted to them, also that the keys of the kingdom
   of heaven were promised to Peter, according to Matthew.

   Seeing however the thoughts of the disciples, the Lord takes care to
   heal the desire of glory by humility; for He first, by simply
   commanding humility, admonishes them that a high station was not to be
   aimed at.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He sat down, and called the twelve and saith
   unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of
   all, and servant of all."

   Jerome: Where it is to be observed, that the disciples disputed by the
   way concerning the chief place, but Christ Himself sat down to teach
   humility; for princes toil while the humble repose.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: The disciples indeed wished
   to receive honour at the hands of the Lord; they also had a desire to
   be made great by Christ, for the great a man is, the more worthy of
   honour he becomes, for which reason He did not throw an obstacle in the
   way of that desire, but brought in humility.

   Theophylact: For His wish is not that we should usurp for ourselves
   chief places, but that we should attain to lofty heights by lowliness.

   He next admonishes them by the example of a child's innocence.

   Wherefore there follows, "And He took a child, and set him in the midst
   of them."

   Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc. see Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 58: By
   the very sight, persuading them to humility and simplicity; for this
   little one was pure from envy and vain glory, and from a desire of
   superiority. But He does not only say, If ye become such, ye shall
   receive a great reward, but also, if ye will honour others, who are
   such for My sake.

   Wherefore there follows: "And when He had taken him in His arms, He
   said unto them, Whosoever shall receive one of such children in My
   name, receiveth Me."

   Bede: By which, He either simply shews that those who would become
   greater must receive the poor of Christ in honour of Him, or He would
   persuade them to be in malice children, to keep simplicity without
   arrogance, charity without envy, devotedness without anger. Again, by
   taking the child into His arms, He implies that the lowly are worthy of
   his embrace and love.

   He adds also, "In My name," that they might, with the fixed purpose of
   reason, follow for His name's sake that mould of virtue to which the
   child keeps, with nature for his guide. And because He taught that He
   Himself was received in children, lest it should be thought that there
   was nothing in Him but what was seen, He added, "And whosoever shall
   receive Me, receiveth not Me, but Him that sent Me.;" thus wishing that
   we should believe Him to be of the same nature and of equal greatness
   with His Father.

   Theophylact: See, how great is humility, for it wins for itself the
   indwelling of the Father, and of the Son, and also of the Holy Ghost.

   38. And John answered Him, saying, "Master, we saw one casting out
   devils in Thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because
   he followeth not us."

   39. But Jesus said, "Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do
   a miracle in My name, that can lightly speak evil of Me.

   40. For He that is not against us is on our part.

   41. For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in My name,
   because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose
   his reward.

   42. And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in
   me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
   and he were cast into the sea."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: John, loving the Lord with eminent devotion, thought that He who
   performed an office to which He had no right was to be excluded from
   the benefit of it.

   Wherefore it is said, "And John answered Him, saying, Master, we saw
   one casting out devils in Thy name, and he followeth not us: and we
   forbad him, because he followeth not us."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: For many believers received
   gifts, and yet were not with Christ, such was this man who cast out
   devils; for there were many of them deficient in some way; some were
   pure in life, but were not so perfect in faith; others again,
   contrariwise.

   Theophylact: Or again, some unbelievers, seeing that the name of Jesus
   was full of virtue, themselves used it, and performed signs, though
   they were unworthy of Divine grace; for the Lord wished to extend His
   name even by the unworthy.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: It was not from jealousy or
   envy, however, that John wished to forbid him who cast out devils, but
   because he wished that all who called on the name of the Lord should
   follow Christ and be one body with His disciples. But the Lord, however
   unworthy they who perform the miracles may be, incites others by their
   means to believe on Him, and induces themselves by this unspeakable
   grace to become better.

   Wherefore there follows: "But Jesus said, Forbid him not."

   Bede: By which He shews that no one is to be driven away from that
   partial goodness which he possesses already, but rather to be stirred
   up to that which he has not as yet obtained.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: In conformity to this, He
   shews that he is not to be forbidden, adding immediately after, "For
   there is no man which shall do a miracle in My name, that can lightly
   speak evil of Me." He says "lightly" to meet the case of those who fell
   into heresy, such as were Simon and Menander, and Cerinthus [ed. note:
   Irenaeus, cont. Haer. 2, 31, seems to imply that the early heretics
   actually worked wonders, but that these differed from Christian
   miracles in that they were done by magic through the aid of the devil,
   and were not works of mercy; he contrasts with these the ecclesiastical
   miracles of his day.]; not that they did miracles in the name of
   Christ, but by their deceptions had the appearance of doing them.

   But these others, though they do not follow us, cannot however set
   themselves to say any thing against us, because they honour My name by
   working miracles.

   Theophylact: For how can he speak evil of Me, who draws glory from My
   name, and works miracles by the invocation of this very name.

   There follows, "For he that is not against you is on your part."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 4, 5: We must take care that this saying of
   the Lord appear not to be contrary to that where He says, "He who is
   not with Me is against Me." [Luke 11:23] Or will any one say that the
   difference lies in that here He says to His disciples, "For he that is
   not against you is on your part," but in the other He speaks of
   Himself, "He who is not with Me is against Me?" As if indeed it were
   possible [ed. note: St. Augustine has here quasi vero, instead of quasi
   non, which hardly makes sense; the latter reading has also been found
   in an old edition of the Catena Aurea, A.D. 1417.] that he who is
   joined to Christ's disciples, who are as His members, should not be
   with Him.

   How if it were so, could it be true that "he that receiveth you
   receiveth Me?" [Matt. 10:40] Or how is he not against Him who is
   against His disciples? Where then will be that saying, "He who
   despiseth you, despiseth Me? [Luke 10:16] But surely what is implied is
   that a man is not with Him in as far as he is against Him, and is not
   against Him in as far as he is with Him.

   For instance, he who worked miracles in the name of Christ, and yet did
   not join himself to the body of His disciples, in as far as he worked
   the miracles in His name, was with them, and was not against them;
   again, in that he did not join their society, he was not with them, and
   was against them.

   Be because they forbade his doing that in which he was with them, the
   Lord said unto them, "Forbid him not:" for they ought to have forbidden
   his being without their society, and thus to have persuaded him of the
   unity of the Church, but they should not have forbidden that in which
   he was with them, that is, his commendation of the name of their Lord
   and Master by the expulsion of devils.

   Thus the Church Catholic does not disapprove in heretics the
   sacraments, which are common, but she blames their division, or some
   opinion of theirs adverse to peace and to truth; for in this they are
   against us.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Or else, this is said of
   those who believe on Him, but nevertheless do not follow Him from the
   looseness of their lives. Again, it is said of devils, who try to
   separate all from God, and to disperse His congregation.

   There follows, "For whosoever shall give you a cup of cold water to
   drink in My name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you,
   he shall not lose his reward."

   Theophylact: Not only will I not forbid him who works miracles in My
   name, but also whosoever shall give you the smallest thing for My
   name's sake, and shall receive you, not on account of human and worldly
   favour, but from love to Me, shall not lose his reward.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., 4, 6: By which He shews, that he of whom John
   had spoken was not so far separated from the fellowship of the
   disciples, as to reject it, as a heretic, but as men are wont to hang
   back from receiving the Sacraments of Christ, and yet favour the
   Christian name, so as even to succour Christians, and do them service
   only because they are Christians. Of these He says they shall not lose
   their reward; not that they ought already to think themselves secure on
   account of this good will which they have towards Christians, without
   being washed with His baptism, and incorporated in His unity, but that
   they are already so guided by the mercy of God, as also to attain to
   these, and thus to go away from this life in security.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: And that no man may allege
   poverty, He mentions that of which none can be destitute, that is, a
   cup of cold water, for which also he will obtain a reward; for it is
   not the value of the gift, but the dignity of those who receive it, and
   the feelings of the giver, which makes a work worthy of reward.

   His words shew that His disciples are to be received, not only on
   account of the reward, which he who receives them obtains, but also,
   because he thus saves himself from punishment.

   There follows: "And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones
   that believe in Me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged
   about his neck, and he were cast into the sea:" as though He would say
   [ed. note: see Chrys., Hom. in Matt. 58], All who honour you for My
   sake have their reward, so also those who dishonour you, that is,
   offend you, shall receive the worst of vengeance.

   Further, from things which are palpable to us, He describes an
   intolerable torment, making mention of a millstone, and of being
   drowned; and He says not, let a millstone be hanged about his neck,
   but, it is better for him to suffer this, shewing by this that some
   more heavy evil awaits him. But He means by "little ones that believe
   on Me," not only those who follow Him, but those who call upon His
   name, those also who offer a cup of cold water, though they do not any
   greater works. Now He will have none of these offended or plucked away;
   for this is what is meant by forbidding them to call upon His name.

   Bede: And fitly the man who if offended is called a little one, for he
   who is great, whatever he may suffer, departs not from the faith; but
   he who is little and weak in mind looks out for occasions of stumbling.
   For this reason we must most of all look to those who are little ones
   in the faith, lest by our fault they should be offended, and go back
   from the faith, and fall away from salvation.

   Greg., in Faeceh., 1, Hom. 7: We must observe, however, that in our
   good works we must sometimes avoid the offence of our neighbour,
   sometimes look down upon it as of no moment. For in as far as we can do
   it without sin, we ought to avoid the offence of our neighbour; but if
   a stumblingblock is laid before men in what concerns the truth, it is
   better to allow the offence to arise, than that the truth should be
   abandoned.

   Greg, de eura, past. p.i.v.2: Mystically by a millstone is expressed
   the tedious round and toil of a secular life, and by the depths of the
   sea, the worst damnation is pointed out. He who therefore, after having
   been brought to a profession of sanctity, destroys others, either by
   word or example, it had been indeed better for him that his worldly
   deeds should render him liable to death, under a secular garb, than
   that his holy office should hole him out as an example for others in
   his faults, because doubtless if he had fallen alone, his pain in hell
   would have been of a more endurable kind.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: Because the Lord had taught us not to offend those who believe on
   Him, He now as next in order warns us how much we should beware of
   those who offend us, that is, who by their words or conduct strive to
   drag us into the perdition of sin; wherefore He says, "And if thy hand
   offend thee, cut it off."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 59: He says not this of our limbs, but of our
   intimate friends, whom as being necessary to us we look upon as our
   limbs; for nothing is so hurtful as mischievous society.

   Bede: That is, He calls by the name of hand, our intimate friend, of
   whose aid we daily stand in need; but if such an one should wish to do
   us a hurt in what concerns our soul, he is to be driven away from our
   society, lest by choosing a portion in this life with one who is lost,
   we should perish together with him in that which is to come.

   Wherefore there follows, "It is better for thee to enter into life
   maimed, than having two hands to enter into hell."

   Gloss.: By maimed He means, deprived of the help of some friend, for it
   is better to enter into life without a friend, than to go with him into
   hell.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, "It is better for thee to enter into life
   maimed," that is, without the chief place, for which you have wished,
   than having two hands to go into eternal fire. The two hands for high
   station are humility and pride; cut off pride, keeping to the estate of
   lowliness.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Then He introduces the
   witness of prophecy from the prophet Isaiah, saying, "Where their worm
   dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." [Isa 65:24] He says not this
   of a visible worm, but He calls conscience, a worm, gnawing the soul
   for not having done any good thing; for each of us shall be made his
   own accuser, by calling to mind what he has done in this mortal life,
   and so their worm remains forever.

   Bede: And as the worm is the pain which inwardly accuses, so the fire
   is a punishment which rages without us; or by the worm is meant the
   rottenness of hell, by the fire, its heat.

   Augustine, de Civ. Dei, 21, 9: But those who hold that both of these,
   namely, the fire and the worm, belong to the pains of the soul, and not
   of the body, say also that those who are separated from the kingdom of
   God are tortured, as with fire, by the pangs of a soul repenting too
   late and hopelessly; and they not unfitly contend that fire may be put
   for that burning grief, as says the Apostle, "Who is offended, and I
   burn not?" [2 Cor 11:29]

   They also think that by the worm must be understood the same grief, as
   is said: "As a moth destroys a garment, and a worm wood, so grief
   tortures the heart of man." [Prov 25:20 Vulgate]

   All those who hesitate not to affirm that there will be pain both of
   body and soul in that punishment affirm that the body is burnt by the
   fire. But although this is more credible, because it is absurd that
   there either the pains of body or of soul should be wanting, still I
   think that it is easier to say that both belong to the body than that
   neither: and therefore it seems to me that Holy Scripture in this place
   is silent about the pains of the soul, because it follows that the soul
   also is tortured in the pains of the body.

   Let each man therefore choose which he will, either to refer the fire
   to the body, the worm to the soul, the one properly, the other in a
   figure, or else both properly to the body; for living things may exist
   even in fire, in burnings without being wasted, in pain without death,
   by the wondrous power of the Almighty Creator.

   It goes on: "And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for
   thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into
   hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched; where their worm
   dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."

   Bede: A friend is called a foot, on account of its service in going
   about for us, since he is as it were ready for our use.

   It goes on: "And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better
   for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two
   eyes to be cast into hell fire; where their worm dieth not, and the
   fire is not quenched."

   A friend who is useful, and anxious, and sharp in perception, is called
   an eye.

   Augustine, de. Con. Evan., 4, 6: Here truly it appears that they who do
   acts of devotedness in the name of Christ, even before they have joined
   themselves to the company of Christians, and have been washed in the
   Christian Sacraments, are more useful than those who though already
   bearing the name of Christians, by their doctrine drag their followers
   with themselves into everlasting punishment; whom also under the name
   of members of the body, He orders, as an offending eye or hand, to be
   torn from the body, that is, from the fellowship itself of unity, that
   we may rather come to everlasting life without them, than with them go
   into hell.

   But the separation of those who separate themselves from them consists
   in the very circumstance of their not yielding to them, when they would
   persuade them to evil, that is, offend them. If indeed their wickedness
   becomes known to all the good men with whom they are connected, they
   are altogether cut off from all fellowship, and even from partaking in
   the heavenly Sacraments.

   If however they are thus known only to the smaller number, whilst their
   wickedness is unknown to the generality, they are to be tolerated in
   such a way that we should not consent to join in their iniquity, and
   that the communion of the good should not be deserted on their account.

   Bede: But because the Lord had three times made mention of the worm and
   the fire, that we might be able to avoid this torment, He subjoins,
   "For every one shall be salted with fire."

   For the stink of worms always arises from the corruption of flesh and
   blood, and therefore fresh meat is seasoned with salt, that the
   moisture of the blood may be dried off, and so it may not breed worms.
   And if, indeed, that which is salted with salt, keeps off the
   putrefying worm, that which is salted with fire, that is, seasoned
   again with flames, on which salt is sprinkled, not only casts off
   worms, but also consumes the flesh itself.

   Flesh and blood therefore breed worms, that is, carnal pleasure, if
   unopposed by the seasoning of continence, produces everlasting
   punishment for the luxurious; the stink of which if any man would
   avoid, let him take care to chasten his body with the salt of
   continence, and his mind with the seasoning of wisdom, from the stain
   of error and vice.

   For salt means the sweetness of wisdom; and fire, the grace of the Holy
   Spirit.

   He says, therefore, "Every one shall be salted with fire," because all
   the elect ought to be purged by spiritual wisdom, from the corruption
   of carnal concupiscence.

   Or else, the fire is the fire of tribulation, by which the patience of
   the faithful is proved, that it may have its perfect work.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Similar to this is that
   which the Apostle says, "And the fire shall try every man's work of
   what sort it is." [1 Cor 3:13]

   Afterwards he brings in a witness from Leviticus: which says, "And
   every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt." [Lev
   2:13]

   Pseudo-Jerome: The oblation of the Lord is the race of man, which is
   here salted by means of wisdom, whilst the corruption of blood, the
   nurse of rottenness, and the mother of worms, is being consumed, which
   there also shall be tried by the purgatorial fire. [ed. note: On the
   subject of the purgatorial fire, see Fluery's Hist., xix, 31, p. 102,
   note i, and Chrysostom, de Statuis, vi, 10, p. 130, note c, Oxford
   trans.]

   Bede: We may also understand the altar to be the heart of the elect,
   and the victims and sacrifices to be offered on the altar are good
   works. But in all sacrifices salt ought to be offered, for that is not
   a good work which is not purged by the salt of wisdom from all
   corruption of vain glory, and other evil and superfluous thoughts.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. in Cat.: Or else it is meant, that every gift
   of our victim, which is accompanied by prayer and the assisting of our
   neighbour, is salted with that divine fire, of which it is said, "I am
   come to send fire on earth." [Luke 12:49] Concerning which it is added:
   "Salt is good;" that is, the fire of love.

   "But if the salt have lost his saltness," that is, is deprived of
   itself, and that peculiar quality, by which it is called, good, "where
   with will ye season it?" For there is salt, which has saltness, that
   is, which has the fulness of grace; and there is salt, which has no
   saltness, for that which is not peaceful is salt unseasoned.

   Bede: Or the good salt is the frequent hearing of God's word, and the
   seasoning the hidden parts of the heart with the salt of spiritual
   wisdom.

   Theophylact: For as salt preserves flesh, and suffers it not to breed
   worms, so also the discourse of the teacher, if it can dry up what is
   evil, constrains carnal men, and suffers not the undying worm to grow
   up in them.

   But if it be without saltness, that is, if its virtue of drying up and
   preserving be gone, with what shall it be salted?

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. in Cat.: Or, according to Matthew, the
   disciples of Christ are the salt, which preserves the whole world,
   resisting the rottenness which proceeds from idolatry and sinful
   fornication. For it may also be meant, that each of us has salt, in as
   far as he contains in himself the graces of God.

   Wherefore also the Apostle joins together grace and salt, saying, "Let
   your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt.: [Col 4:6]

   For salt is the Lord Jesus Christ, Who was able to preserve the whole
   earth, and made many to be salt in the earth: and if any of these be
   corrupted, (for it is possible for even the good to be changed into
   corruption,) they are worthy to be cast out.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or otherwise; That salt is saltless which loves the
   chief place, and dares not rebuke others.

   Wherefore there follows, "Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one
   with another."

   That is, let the love of your neighbour temper the saltness of rebuke,
   and the salt of justice season the love of your neighbour.

   Greg., De cura past., iii, e.22: Or this is said against those whom
   greater knowledge, while it raises above their neighbours, cuts off
   from the fellowship of others; thus the more their learning increases,
   the more they unlearn the virtue of concord.

   Greg., De cura past., ii, 4: He also who strives to speak with wisdom
   should be greatly afraid, lest by his eloquence the unity of his
   hearers be thrown into confusion, lest, while he would appear wise, he
   unwisely cut asunder the bonds of unity.

   Theophylact: Or else, he who binds himself to his neighbour by the tie
   of love, has salt, and in this way peace with his neighbour.

   Augustine, de. Con, iv. 6: Mark relates that the Lord said these things
   consecutively, and has put down some things omitted by every other
   Evangelist, some which Matthew has also related, others which both
   Matthew and Luke relate, but on other occasions, and in a different
   series of events. Wherefore it seems to me that our Lord repeated in
   this place discourses which He had used in other places, because they
   were pertinent enough to this saying of His, by which He prevented
   their forbidding miracles to be wrought in His name, even by him who
   followed Him not together with His disciples.

Chapter 10

   1. And He arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by
   the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto Him again; and,
   as He was wont, He taught them again.

   2. And the Pharisees came to Him, and asked Him, "Is it lawful for a
   man to put away his wife?," tempting Him.

   3. And He answered and said unto them, "What did Moses command you?"

   4. And they said, "Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and
   to put her away."

   5. And Jesus answered and said unto them, "For the hardness of your
   heart he wrote you this precept."

   6. But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
   female.

   7. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave
   to his wife;

   8. And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain,
   but one flesh.

   9. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."

   10. And in the house, His disciples asked Him again of the same matter.

   11. And He saith unto them, "Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
   marry another, committeth adultery against her.

   12. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
   another, she committeth adultery."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, In Marcum, 3, 40: Up to this time, Mark hath related what Our
   Lord said and did in Galilee; here he begins to relate what He did,
   taught, or suffered in Judaea, and first indeed across the Jordan on
   the east; and this is what is said in these words: "And He arose from
   thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea, by the farther side of
   Jordan"; then also on this side Jordan, when He came to Jericho,
   Bethany, and Jerusalem. And though all the province of the Jews is
   generally called Judaea, to distinguish it from other nations, more
   especially, however, its southern portion was called Judaea, to
   distinguish it from Samaria, Galilee, Decapolis, and the other regions
   in the same province.

   Theophylact: But He enters the region of Judaea, which the envy of the
   Jews had often caused Him to leave, because His Passion was to take
   place there. He did not, however, then go up to Jerusalem, but to the
   confines of Judaea, that He might do good to the multitudes, who were
   not evil; for Jerusalem was, from the malice of the Jews, the worker of
   all the wickedness.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And the people resort unto Him again, and, as He
   was wont, He taught them again."

   Bede: Mark the difference of temper in the multitude and in the
   Pharisees. The former meet together, in order to be taught, and that
   their sick may be healed, as Matthew relates [Matt 19:2]; the latter
   come to Him, to try to deceive their Saviour by tempting Him.

   Wherefore there follows: "And the Pharisees came to Him, and asked Him,
   Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting Him."

   Theophylact: They come to Him indeed, and do not quit Him, lest the
   multitudes should believe on Him; and by continually coming to Him,
   they thought to bring Him into difficulty, and to confuse Him by their
   questions. For they proposed to Him a question, which had on either
   side a precipice, so that whether He said that it was lawful for a man
   to put away his wife, or that it was not lawful, they might accuse Him,
   and contradict what He said, out of the doctrines of Moses. Christ,
   therefore, being Very Wisdom, in answering their question, avoids their
   snares.

   Chrys., Vict. Ant., Cat. in Marc., and see Chrys. Hom. 62 [note: the
   same sort of comment is to be found in Origin, in Matt. tom. 14, 17,
   IIii in Matt. 19, Ambr. in Luc. 8, 9. Auct. Op. Imperfecti in loc.
   Theophyl. in Matt. 19.]: For being asked, whether it is lawful, he does
   not immediately reply, it is not lawful, lest they should raise an
   outcry, but He first wished them to answer Him as to the sentence of
   the law, that they by their answer might furnish Him with what it was
   right to say.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He answered and said unto them, What did
   Moses command you?"

   And afterwards, "And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of
   divorcement, and to put her away."

   They put forward indeed this that Moses had said either on account of
   the question of our Saviour, or wishing to excite against Him a
   multitude of men. For divorce was an indifferent thing among the Jews,
   and all practised it, as though it were permitted by the law.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 62: It makes nothing, however, to the
   truth of the fact, whether, as Matthew says, they themselves addressed
   to the Lord the question concerning the bill of divorcement, allowed to
   them by Moses, on our Lord's forbidding the separation, and confirming
   His sentence from the law, or whether it was in answer to a question of
   His, that they said this concerning the command of Moses, as Mark here
   says. For His wish was to give them no reason why Moses permitted it,
   before they themselves had mentioned the fact; since then the wish of
   the parties speaking, which is what the words ought to express, is in
   either way shewn, there is no discrepancy, though there be a difference
   in the way of relating it. It may also be meant that, as Mark expresses
   it, the question put to them by the Lord, What did Moses command?, was
   in answer to those who had previously asked His opinion concerning the
   putting away of a wife. And when they had replied that Moses permitted
   them to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away, His answer
   was concerning that same law, given by Moses, how God instituted the
   marriage of a male, and a female, saying those things which Matthew
   relates [Matt 19:4]; on hearing which they again rejoined what they had
   replied to Him when He first asked them, namely - Why then did Moses
   command?

   Augustine, cont. Faust, XIX, 26: Moses, however, was against a man's
   dismissing his wife, for he interposed this delay, that a person whose
   mind was bent on separation, might be deterred by the writing of the
   bill, and desist; particularly, since, as is related, among the
   Hebrews, no one was allowed to write Hebrew characters but the scribes.
   The law therefore wished to send him, whom it ordered to give a bill of
   divorcement, before he dismissed his wife, to them, who ought to be
   wise interpreters of the law, and just opponents of quarrel. For a bill
   could only be written for him by men, who by their good advice might
   overrule him, since his circumstances and necessity had put him into
   their hands, and so by treating between him and his wife they might
   persuade them to love and concord.

   But if a hatred so great had arisen that it could not be extinguished
   and corrected, then indeed a bill was to be written, that he might not
   lightly put away her who was the object of his hate, in such a way as
   to prevent his being recalled to the love, which he owed her by
   marriage, through the persuasion of the wise. For this reason it is
   added, "For the hardness of your heart, he wrote this precept"; for
   great was the hardness of heart which could not be melted or bent to
   the taking back and recalling the love of marriage, even by the
   interposition of a bill in a way which gave room for the just and wise
   to dissuade them.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Cat. in Marc. Oxon: Or else, it is said, "For the
   hardness of your hearts," because it is possible for a soul purged from
   desires and from anger to bear the worst of women; but if those
   passions have a redoubled force over the mind, many evils will arise
   from hatred in marriage.

   Chrys.: Thus then, He saves Moses, who had given the law, from their
   accusation, and turns the whole upon their head. But since what He had
   said was grievous to them, He at once brings back the discourse to the
   old law, saying, "But from the beginning of the creation, God made them
   male and female."

   Bede: He says not male and females, which the sense would have required
   had it referred to the divorce of former wives, but "male" and
   "female", so that they might be bound by the tie of one wife.

   Chrys.: If however he had wished one wife to be put away and another to
   be brought in, He would have created several women. Nor did God only
   join one woman to one man, but He also bade a man quit his parents and
   cleave to his wife.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And he said, (that is, God, said by Adam) For
   this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his
   wife.

   From the very mode of speech, shewing the impossibility of severing
   marriage, because He said, "He shall cleave."

   Bede: And in like manner, because He says, he shall cleave to his wife,
   not wives.

   It goes on: "And they twain shall be one flesh."

   Chrys.: Being framed out of one root, they will join into one body.

   It goes on: "So then they are no more twain, but one flesh."

   Bede: The reward then of marriage is of two to become one flesh.
   Virginity being joined to the Spirit, becomes of one spirit.

   Chrys.: After this, bringing forward an awful argument, He said not, do
   not divide, but He concluded, "What therefore God hath joined together,
   let not man put asunder."

   Augustine, cont. Faust, XIX, 29: Behold the Jews are convinced out of
   the books of Moses, that a wife is not to be put away, while they
   fancied that in putting her away, they were doing the will of Moses. In
   like manner from this place, from the witness of Christ Himself, we
   know this, that God made and joined male and female, for denying which
   the Manichees are condemned, resisting now not the books of Moses, but
   the Gospel of Christ.

   Bede: What therefore God hath conjoined by making one flesh of a man
   and a woman, that man cannot separate, but God alone. Man separates,
   when we dismiss the first wife because we desire a second; but it is
   God who separates, when by common consent [1 Cor 7:5], for the sake of
   serving God, we so have wives as though we had none [1 Cor 7:29].

   Chrys.: But if two persons, whom God has joined together, are not to be
   separated; much more is it wrong to separate from Christ, the Church,
   which God has joined to Him.

   Theophylact: But the disciples were offended, as not being fully
   satisfied with what had been said; for this reason they again question
   Him.

   Wherefore there follows: "And in the house, His disciples asked Him
   again of the same matter."

   Pseudo-Jerome: This second question is said to be asked "again" by the
   Apostles, because it is on the subject of which the Pharisees had asked
   Him, that is, concerning the state of marriage; and this is said by
   Mark in his own person.

   Gloss: For a repetition of a saying of the Word, produces not
   weariness, but thirst and hunger.

   Wherefore it is said, "They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they
   that drink me shall yet be thirsty"; for the tasting of the honied
   words of wisdom yields all manner of savour to them who love her.

   Wherefore the Lord instructs His disciples over again; for it goes on,
   "And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry
   another, committeth adultery upon her."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant., e Cat. in Marc.: The Lord calls by the name
   of adultery cohabitation with her who is not a man's wife; she is not,
   however, a wife, whom a man has taken to him, after quitting the first;
   and for this reason he commits adultery upon her, that is, upon the
   second, whom he brings in. And the same thing is true in the case of
   the woman; wherefore it goes on, "And if a woman shall put away her
   husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery"; for she cannot be
   joined to another as her own husband, if she leave him who is really
   her own husband. The law indeed forbade what was plainly adultery; but
   the Saviour forbids this, which was neither plain, nor known to all,
   though it was contrary to nature.

   Bede: In Matthew it is more fully expressed, "Whosoever shall put away
   his wife, except it be for fornication." [Matt 19:9] The only carnal
   cause then is fornication; the only spiritual cause is the fear of God,
   that a man should put away his wife to enter into religion [ed. note:
   Husbands and wives have never been allowed to take monastic vows
   without mutual consent, see Bingham, book 7, ch 3; where also are
   incidentally given many instances of married persons thus giving up the
   world.], as we read that many have done. But there is no cause allowed
   by the law of God for marrying another, during the lifetime of her who
   is quitted.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: There is no contrariety in
   Matthew's relating that He spoke these words to the Pharisees, though
   Mark says that they were spoken to the disciples; for it is possible
   that He may have spoken them to both.

   13. And they brought young children to Him, that He should touch them:
   and His disciples rebuked those that brought them.

   14. But when Jesus saw it, He was much displeased, and said unto them,
   "Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not: for
   of such is the kingdom of God."

   15. Verily I say unto you, "Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
   God as a little child, he shall not enter therein."

   16. And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and
   blessed them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: The wickedness of the Pharisees in tempting Christ, has
   been related above, and now is shewn the great faith of the multitude,
   who believed that Christ conferred a blessing on the children whom they
   brought to Him, by the mere laying on of His hands.

   Wherefore it is said: "And they brought young children to Him, that He
   might touch them."

   Chrys.: But the disciples, out of regard for the dignity of Christ,
   forbade those who brought them. And this is what is added: "And His
   disciples rebuked those who brought them." But our Saviour, in order to
   teach His disciples to be modest in their ideas, and to tread under
   foot worldly pride, takes the children to Him, and assigns to them the
   kingdom of God.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He said unto them, Suffer the little
   children to come unto Me, and forbid them not."

   Origin, in Matt., XV, 7: If any of those who profess to hold the office
   of teaching in the Church should see a person bringing to them some of
   the foolish of this world, and low born, and weak, who for this reason
   are called children and infants, let him not forbid the man who offers
   such an one to the Saviour, as though he were acting without judgment.
   After this He exhorts those of His disciples who are already grown to
   full stature to condescend to be useful to children, that they may
   become to children as children, that they may gain children [1 Cor
   9:22]; for He Himself, when He was in the form of God, humbled Himself,
   and became a child.

   One which He adds: "For of such is the kingdom of heaven."

   Chrys.: For indeed the mind of a child is pure from all passions, for
   which reason, we ought by free choice to do those works, which children
   hate by nature.

   Theophylact: Wherefore He says not, "for of" these, but "of such is the
   kingdom of God," that is, of persons who have both in their intention
   and their work the harmlessness and simplicity which children have by
   nature. For a child does not hate, does nothing of evil intent, nor
   though beaten does he quit his mother; and though she clothe him in
   vile garments, prefers them to kingly apparel; in like manner he, who
   lives according to the good ways of his mother the Church, honours
   nothing before her, nay, not pleasure, which is the queen of many;
   wherefore also the Lord subjoins, "Verily I say unto you, Whosoever
   shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not
   enter therein."

   Bede: That is, if ye have not innocence and purity of mind like that of
   children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. Or else, we are
   ordered to receive the kingdom of God, that is, the doctrine of the
   Gospel, as a little child, because as a child, when he is taught, does
   not contradict his teachers, nor put together reasonings and words
   against them, but receives with faith what they teach, and obeys them
   with awe, so we also are to receive the word of the Lord with simple
   obedience, and without any gainsaying.

   It goes on: "And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them,
   and blessed them."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant, e Cat. in Marc.: Fitly does He take them up
   into His arms to bless them, as it were, lifting into His own bosom,
   and reconciling Himself to His creation, which in the beginning fell
   from Him, and was separated from Him. Again, He puts His hands upon the
   children, to teach us the working of his divine power; and indeed, He
   puts His hands upon them, as others are wont to do, though His
   operation is not as that of others, for though He was God, He kept to
   human ways of acting, as being very man.

   Bede: Having embraced the children, He also blessed them, implying that
   the lowly in spirit are worthy of His blessing, grace and love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   17. And when He was gone forth into the way, there came one running,
   and kneeled to Him, and asked Him, "Good Master, what shall I do that I
   may inherit eternal life?"

   18. And Jesus said unto Him, "Why callest thou me good? there is none
   good but one, that is, God.

   19. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill,
   Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father
   and mother."

   20. And he answered and said unto Him, "Master, all these have I
   observed from My youth."

   21. Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, "One thing
   thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the
   poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the
   cross, and follow Me."

   22. And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had
   great possessions.

   23. And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto His disciples, "How
   hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"

   24. And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answereth
   again, and saith unto them, "Children, how hard is it for them that
   trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!

   25. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than
   for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."

   26. And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves,
   "Who then can be saved?"

   27. And Jesus, looking upon them, saith, "With men it is impossible,
   but not with God: for with God all things are possible."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: A certain man had heard from the Lord that only they who are
   willing to be like little children are worthy to enter into the kingdom
   of heaven, and therefore he desires to have explained to him, not in
   parables, but openly, by the merits of what works a man may attain
   everlasting life.

   Wherefore it is said: "And when He was gone forth into the way, there
   came one running, and kneeled to Him, and asked Him, Good Master, what
   shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"

   Theophylact: I wonder at this young man, who when all others come to
   Christ to be healed of their infirmities, begs of Him the possession of
   everlasting life, notwithstanding his love of money, the malignant
   passion which afterwards caused his sorrow.

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 63: Because however he had come to Christ as he
   would to a man, and to one of the Jewish doctors, Christ answered him
   as Man.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me
   good? there is none good but the One God."

   In saying which He does not exclude men from goodness, but from a
   comparison with the goodness of God.

   Bede: But by this one God, Who is good, we must not only understand the
   Father, but also the Son, who says, "I am the good Shepherd;" [John
   10:11] and also the Holy Ghost, because it is said, "The Father which
   is in heaven will give the good Spirit to them that ask him." [Luke
   11:13] For the One and Undivided Trinity itself, Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost, is the Only and One good God. The Lord, therefore, does not deny
   Himself to be good, but implies that He is God; He does not deny that
   He is good Master, but He declares that no master is good but God.

   Theophylact: Therefore the Lord intended by these words to raise the
   mind of the young man, so that he might know Him to be God. But He also
   implies another thing by these words, that when you have to converse
   with a man, you should not flatter him in your conversation, but look
   back upon God, the root and fount of goodness, and do honour to Him.

   Bede: But observe that the righteousness of the law, when kept in its
   own time, conferred not only earthly goods, but also eternal life on
   those who chose it. Wherefore the Lord's answer to one who enquires
   concerning everlasting life is, "Thou knowest the commandments, Do not
   commit adultery, Do not kill"; for this is the childlike blamelessness
   which is proposed to us, if we would enter the kingdom of heaven.

   On which there follows, "And he answered and said unto Him, Master, all
   these have I observed from my youth."

   We must not suppose that this man either asked the Lord, with a wish to
   tempt Him, as some have fancied, or lied in his account of his life;
   but we must believe that he confessed with simplicity how he had lived;
   which is evident, from what is subjoined, "Then Jesus beholding him
   loved him, and said unto him." If however he had been guilty of lying
   or of dissimulation, by no means would Jesus, after looking on the
   secrets of his heart, have been said to love him.

   Origen, in Evan. tom. xv, 14: For in that He loved, or kissed him [ed.
   note: osculaius, interpretation in Ed. Ben. (?)], He appears to affirm
   the truth of his profession, in saying that he had fulfilled all those
   things; for on applying His mind to him, He saw that the man answered
   with a good conscience.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Cat. in Marc. Oxon.: It is worthy of enquiry, however,
   how He loved a man, who, He knew, would not follow Him? But this is so
   much as to say, that since he was worthy of love in the first instance,
   because he observed the things of the law from his youth, so in the
   end, though he did not take upon himself perfection, he did not suffer
   a lessening of his former love. For although he did not pass the bounds
   of humanity, nor follow the perfection of Christ, still he was not
   guilty of any sin, since he kept the law according to the capability of
   a man, and in this mode of keeping it, Christ loved him [ed. note: The
   general meaning corresponds with the original, and is, that the young
   man is a type of those who keep the Gospel precepts, without going on
   to counsels of perfection; but the sense of the Greek has been missed
   by the Latin translator].

   Bede: For God loves those who keep the commandments of the law, though
   they be inferior; nevertheless, He shews to those who would be perfect
   the deficiency of the law, for He came not to destroy the law, but to
   fulfil it. [Matt 5:17]

   Wherefore there follows: "And said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go
   thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
   shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me;" for whosoever
   would be perfect ought to sell all that he has, not a part, like
   Ananias and Sapphira, but the whole. Theophylact: And when he has sold
   it, to give it to the poor, not to stage-players and luxurious persons.

   Chrys.: Well too did He say, not eternal life, but "treasure", saying,
   "And thou shalt have treasure in heaven"; for since the question was
   concerning wealth, and the renouncing of all things, He shews that He
   returns more things than He has bidden us leave, in proportion as
   heaven is greater than earth.

   Theophylact: But because there are many poor who are not humble, but
   are drunkards or have some other vice, for this reason He says, "And
   come, follow me."

   Bede: For he follows the Lord, who imitates Him, and walks in His
   footsteps.

   It goes on: "And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved.

   Chrys.: And the Evangelist adds the cause of his grief, saying, "For he
   had great possession." The feelings of those who have little and those
   who have much are not the same, for the increase of acquired wealth
   lights up a greater flame of covetousness.

   There follows: "And Jesus looked round about, and said unto His
   disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the
   kingdom of God."

   Theophylact: He says not here, that riches are bad, but that those are
   bad who only have them to watch them carefully; for He teaches us not
   to have them, that is, not to keep or preserve them, but to use them in
   necessary things.

   Chrys.: But the Lord said this to His disciples, who were poor and
   possessed nothing, in order to teach them not to blush at their
   poverty, and as it were to make an excuse to them, and given them a
   reason, why He had not allowed them to possess any thing.

   It goes on: "And the disciples were astonished at His words"; for it is
   plain, since they themselves were poor, that they were anxious for the
   salvation of others.

   Bede: But there is a great difference between having riches, and loving
   them; wherefore also Solomon says not, He that hath silver, but, "He
   that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver." [Eccles 5:10]
   Therefore the Lord unfolds the words of His former saying to His
   astonished disciples, as follows: "But Jesus answereth again, and saith
   unto them, Children, how hard it is for them that trust in their riches
   to enter the kingdom of God." Where we must observe that He says not,
   how impossible, but "how hard"; for what is impossible cannot in any
   way come to pass, what is difficult can be compassed, though with
   labour.

   Chrys.: Or else, after saying, "difficult," He then shews that it is
   impossible, and that not simply, but with a certain vehemence; and He
   shews this by an example, saying, "It is easier for a camel to pass
   through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom
   of heaven."

   Theophylact: It may be that by camel, we should understand the animal
   itself, or else that thick cable, which is used for large vessels.

   Bede: How then could either in the Gospel, Matthew and Joseph, or in
   the Old Testament, very many rich persons, enter into the kingdom of
   God, unless it be that they learned through the inspiration of God
   either to count their riches as nothing, or to quit them altogether. Or
   in a higher sense, it is easier for Christ to suffer for those who love
   Him, than for the lovers of this world to turn to Christ; for under the
   name of camel, He wished Himself to be understood, because He bore the
   burden of our weakness; and by the needle, He understands the
   prickings, that is, the pains of His Passion. By the eye of a needle,
   therefore, He means the straits of His Passion, by which He, as it
   were, deigned to mend the torn garments of our nature.

   It goes on: "And they were astonished above measure, saying among
   themselves, Who then can be saved?"

   Since the number of poor people is immeasurably the greater, and these
   might be saved, though the rich perished, they must have understood Him
   to mean that all who love riches, although they cannot obtain them, are
   reckoned in the number of the rich.

   It goes on: "And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is
   impossible, but not with God"; which we must not take to mean, that
   covetous and proud persons can enter into the kingdom of Heaven with
   their covetousness and pride, but that it is possible with God that
   they should be converted from covetousness and pride to charity and
   lowliness.

   Chrys.: And the reason why He says that this is the work of God is,
   that He may shew that he who is put into this path by God, has much
   need of grace; from which it is proved, that great is the reward of
   those rich men, who are willing to follow the discipline [ed. note:
   philosophia] of Christ.

   Theophylact: Or we must understand that by, "with men it is impossible,
   but not with God," He means, that when we listen to God, it becomes
   possible, but as long as we keep our human notions, it is impossible.
   There follows, "For all things are possible with God"; when He says
   "all things", you must understand, that have a being, which sin has
   not, for it is a thing without being and substance [ed. note: This is
   often urged by St. Augustine against the Manichees, who held that evil
   was a principle and a substance, coeternal with good. It also appears
   in the Pelagian controversy, for Pelagius argued that the Catholic
   doctrine of original sin implied that it was a substance; St. Augustine
   answers that though not a substance, it was a privation or
   disorganization of parts, just as darkness is a privation of light, and
   sickness a disordered state of body; which illustrates what Theophylact
   means by saying, that sin, though so great an evil, has no being or
   substance. see Aug. Conf. 7, 12, de Nat. et Grac. 21].

   Or else: sin does not come under the notion of strength, but of
   weakness, therefore sin, like weakness, is impossible with God. But can
   God cause that not to have been done which has been done? To which we
   answer, that God is Truth, but to cause that what has been done should
   not have been done, is falsehood. How then can truth do what is false?
   He must first therefore quit His own nature, so that they who speak
   thus really say, Can God cease to be God? which is absurd.

   28. Then Peter began to say unto him, "Lo, we have left all, and have
   followed thee."

   29. And Jesus answered and said, "Verily I say unto you, There is no
   man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
   mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My sake, and the Gospel's,

   30. But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and
   brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
   persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

   31. But many that are first shall be last; and the last first."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: Because the youth, on hearing the advice of our Saviour
   concerning the casting away of his goods, had gone away sorrowful, the
   disciples of Christ, who had already fulfilled the foregoing precept,
   began to question Him concerning their reward, thinking that they had
   done a great thing, since the young man, who had fulfilled the
   commandments of the law, had not been able to hear it without sadness.

   Wherefore Peter questions the Lord for himself and the others, in these
   words, "Then Peter began to say unto Him, Lo, we have left all, and
   have followed thee."

   Theophylact: Although Peter had left but few things, still he calls
   these his all; for even a few things keep us by the bond of affection,
   so that he shall be beatified who leaves a few things.

   Bede: And because it is not sufficient to have left all, he adds that
   which makes up perfection, "and have followed thee." As if he said, We
   have done what Thou hast commanded. What reward therefore wilt Thou
   give us?

   Theophylact: But while Peter asks only concerning the disciples, our
   Lord makes a general answer; wherefore it goes on: "Jesus answered and
   said, Verily I say unto you, There is no one that hath left house, or
   brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands." But
   in saying this, He does not mean that we should leave our fathers,
   without helping them, or that we should separate ourselves from our
   wives; but He instructs us to prefer the glory of God to the things of
   this world.

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 64: But it seems to me that by these words He
   intended covertly to proclaim that there were to be persecutions, as it
   would come to pass that many fathers would allure their sons to
   impiety, and many wives their husbands.

   Chrys., Cat. in Marc. Oxon.: Again He delays not to say, "for my name's
   sake and the Gospel's " and Mark says, or "for the kingdom of God," as
   Luke says; the name of Christ is the power of the Gospel, and of His
   kingdom; for the Gospel is received in the name of Jesus Christ, and
   the kingdom is made known, and comes by His name.

   Bede: Some, however, taking occasion from this saying, in which it is
   announced that he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, teach
   that Jewish fable of a thousand years after the resurrection of the
   just, when all that we have left for the Lord's sake is to be restored
   with manifold usury, besides which we are to receive the crown of
   everlasting life. These persons do no perceive, that although the
   promise in other respects be honourable, yet in the hundred wives,
   which the other Evangelists mention, its foulness is made manifest:
   particularly when the Lord testifies that there shall be not marriage
   in the resurrection, and asserts that those things which are put away
   from us for His sake are to be received again in this life with
   persecutions, which, as they affirm, will not take place in their
   thousand years. [ed. note: Certain early Fathers, as, for instance, St.
   Austin and Irenaeus, held the doctrine of the Millennium; Bede however
   mentions the Chilliasts (though their name is omitted in the Catena)
   and thus shews that he means the Corinthians, to whom that name was
   applied, on account of their shocking doctrine, that after the
   resurrection the Christians were to reign on earth for a thousand years
   in sensual pleasures, see Aug, de. Her. 8]

   Pseudo-Chrys.: This hundredfold reward therefore must be in
   participation, not in possession, for the Lord fulfilled this to them
   not carnally, but spiritually.

   Theophylact: For a wife is busied in a house about her husband's food
   and raiment. See also how this is the case with the Apostles; for many
   women busied themselves about their food and their clothing, and
   ministered unto them. In like manner the Apostles had many fathers and
   mothers, that is, persons who loved them; as Peter, for instance,
   leaving one house, had afterwards the houses of all the disciples. And
   what is more wonderful, they are to be persecuted and oppressed, for it
   is "with persecutions" that the Saints are to possess all things, for
   which reason there follows, "But many that are first shall be last, and
   the last first." For the Pharisees who were first became the last; but
   those who left all and followed Christ were last in this world through
   tribulation and persecutions, but shall be first by the hope which is
   in God.

   Bede: This which is here said, "shall receive an hundredfold," may be
   understood in a higher sense. [see note, p. 78] For the number a
   hundred which is reckoned by changing from the left to the right hand,
   although it has the same appearance in the bending of the fingers as
   the ten had on the left, nevertheless is increased to a much greater
   quantity. This means, that all who have despised temporal things for
   the sake of the kingdom of heaven through undoubting faith, taste the
   joy of the same kingdom in this life which is full of persecutions, and
   in the expectation of the heavenly country, which is signified by the
   right hand, have a share in the happiness of all the elect. But because
   all do not accomplish a virtuous course of life with the same ardour as
   they began it, it is presently added, "But many that are first shall be
   last, and the last first"; for we daily see many persons who, remaining
   in a lay habit, are eminent for their meritorious life; but others, who
   from their youth have been ardent in a spiritual profession, at last
   wither away in the sloth of ease, and with a lazy folly finish in the
   flesh, what they had begun in the Spirit.

   32. And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
   before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were
   afraid. And He took again the twelve, and began to tell them what
   things should happen unto Him,

   33. Saying, "Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
   delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall
   condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles:

   34. And they shall mock Him, and shall scourge Him, and shall spit upon
   Him, and shall kill Him: and the third day He shall rise again."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: The disciples remembered the discourse in which the Lord had
   foretold that He was about to suffer many things from the chief priests
   and scribes, and therefore in going up to Jerusalem, they were amazed.
   And this is what is meant, when it is said, "And they were in the way
   going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them."

   Theophylact: To shew that He runs to meet His Passion, and that He does
   not refuse death, for the sake of our salvation; and they were amazed,
   and as they followed, they were afraid.

   Bede: Either lest they themselves should perish with Him, or at all
   events lest He, whose life and ministry was their joy, should fall
   under the hand of His enemies. But the Lord, foreseeing that the minds
   of His disciples would be troubled by His Passion, foretells to them
   both the pain of His Passion, and the glory of His Resurrection.

   Wherefore there follows: "And He took again the twelve, and began to
   tell them what things should happen unto Him."

   Theophylact: He did this to confirm the hearts of the disciples, that
   from hearing these things beforehand, they might the better bear them
   afterwards, and might not be alarmed at their suddenness, and also in
   order to shew them that He suffered voluntarily; for he who foreknows a
   danger, and flies not, though flight is in his power, evidently of his
   own will gives himself up to suffering. But He takes His disciples
   apart, because it was fitting that He should reveal the mystery of His
   Passion to those who were more closely connected with Him.

   Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc. sed v. Chrys. Hom. 65: And He
   enumerates each thing that was to happen to Him; lest if He should pass
   any thing over, they should be troubled afterwards at suddenly seeing
   it.

   Wherefore He adds, "Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man."

   Gloss.: That is, He to whom suffering belongs; for the Godhead cannot
   suffer. "Shall be delivered," that is, by Judas, "unto the Chief
   Priests, and unto the Scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death";
   judging Him to be guilty of death; "and shall deliver Him to the
   Gentiles," that is, to Pilate the Gentile; and his soldiers "shall mock
   Him, and shall spit upon Him, and scourge Him, and put Him to death."

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 65: But that when they were saddened on account
   of His Passion and death, they should then also look for His
   Resurrection, He adds, "And the third day He shall rise again"; for
   since He had not hid from them the sorrows and insults which happened,
   it was fitting that they should believe Him on other points.
     __________________________________________________________________

   35. And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto Him, saying,
   "Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall
   desire."

   36. And He said unto them, "What would ye that I should do for you?"

   37. They said unto Him, "Grant unto us that we may sit, one on Thy
   right hand, and the other on Thy left hand, in Thy glory."

   38. But Jesus said unto them, "Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of
   the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am
   baptized with?"

   39. And they said unto Him, "We can." And Jesus said unto them, "Ye
   shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism
   that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:

   40. But to sit on My right hand and on My left hand is not mine to
   give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chrys.: The disciples hearing Christ oftentimes speaking of His
   kingdom, thought that this kingdom was to be before His death, and
   therefore now that His death was foretold to them, they came to Him,
   that they might immediately be made worthy of the honours of the
   kingdom.

   Wherefore it is said, "And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came
   unto Him, saying, Master, we would that Thou shouldest do for us
   whatsoever we shall desire."

   For ashamed of the human weakness which they felt, they came to Christ,
   taking Him apart from the disciples; but our Saviour, not from
   ignorance of what they wanted to ask, but from a wish of making them
   answer Him, puts this question to them; "And He said unto them, What
   would ye that I should do for you?"

   Theophylact: Now the abovementioned disciples thought that He was going
   up to Jerusalem, to reign there, and then to suffer what He had
   foretold. And with these thoughts, they desired to sit on the right
   hand and the left hand.

   Wherefore there follows: "They said unto Him, Grant unto us that we may
   sit, one on Thy right hand, the other on Thy left hand, in Thy glory."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 64: Matthew has expressed that this was
   said not by themselves, but by their mother, since she brought their
   wishes to the Lord; wherefore Mark briefly implies rather that they
   themselves, rather than their mother, had used the words.

   Chrys.: Or we may fitly say that both took place; for seeing themselves
   honoured above the rest, they thought that they could easily obtain the
   foregoing petition; and that they might the more easily succeed in
   their request, they took their mother with them, that they might pray
   unto Christ together with her.

   Augustine: Then the Lord both according to Mark, and to Matthew,
   answered them rather than their mother.

   For it goes on: "But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask."

   Theophylact: It will not be as ye think, that I am to reign as a
   temporal king in Jerusalem, but all these things, that is, these which
   belong to My kingdom, are beyond your understanding; for to site on My
   right hand is so great a thing that it surpasses the Angelic orders.

   Bede: Or else, they know not what they ask, who seek from the Lord a
   seat of glory, which they do not yet merit.

   Chrys.: Or else He says, "Ye know not what ye ask"; as if He said, Ye
   speak of honours, but I am discoursing of wrestlings and toil; for this
   is not a time of rewards, but of blood, of battles, and dangers.

   Wherefore He adds, "Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of, and be
   baptized with the baptism that I am baptized withal?"

   He draws them on by way of question, that by communication with
   Himself, their eagerness might increase.

   Theophylact: But by the cup and baptism, He means the cross; the cup,
   that is, as being a potion by Him sweetly received, but baptism as the
   cause of the cleansing of our sins. And they answer Him, without
   understanding what He had said; wherefore it goes on: "And they said
   unto Him, We can;" for they thought that He spoke of a visible cup, and
   of the baptism of which the Jews made use, that is, the washings before
   their meals.

   Chrys.: And they answered thus quickly, because they expected that what
   they had asked would be listened to; it goes on: "And Jesus said unto
   them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of, and with the
   baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized;" that is, ye
   shall be worthy of martyrdom, and suffer even as I.

   Bede: A question is raised, however, how James and John drank the cup
   of martyrdom, or how they were baptized with the baptism of the Lord,
   when the Scripture relates, that only James the Apostle was beheaded by
   Herod whilst John finished his life by a natural death. But if we read
   ecclesiastical histories, in which it is related, that he also on
   account of the witness which he bore was cast into a cauldron of
   burning oil, and was immediately sent away to the island of Patmos, we
   shall then see that the spirit of martyrdom was in him, and that John
   drank the cup of confession, which the Three Children also drank in the
   furnace of fire, though the persecutor did not spill their blood.

   It goes on: "But to sit on My right hand and on My left hand is not
   mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared."

   Chrys.: Where two questions are raised, one is, whether a seat on His
   right hand is prepared for any one; the other, whether the Lord of all
   has it not in His power to give it to those for whom it is prepared. To
   the first then we say, that no one sits on His right hand or on His
   left, for that throne is inaccessible to a creature.

   How then did He say, "To sit on My right hand or on My left is not mine
   to give you," as though it belonged to some who were to sit there? He
   however answers the thoughts of those who asked Him, condescending to
   their meaning; for they did not know that lofty throne and seat, which
   is on the right hand of the Father, but sought one thing alone, that
   is, to possess the chief place, and to be set over others. And since
   they had heard it said of the Apostles, that they were to sit on twelve
   thrones, they begged for a place higher than all the rest, not knowing
   what was said. To the second question we must say, that such a gift
   does not transcend the power of the Son of God, but what is said by
   Matthew, "it is prepared by My Father," [Matt. 20:23] is the same as if
   it were said, "by Me," wherefore also Mark did not say here, by My
   Father.

   What therefore Christ says here is this, Ye shall die, He says, for Me,
   but this is not enough to enable you to obtain the highest place, for
   if another person comes possessing besides martyrdom all other virtues,
   he will possess much more than you; for the chief place is prepared for
   those, who by works are enabled to become the first. Thus then the Lord
   instructed them not to trouble themselves vainly and absurdly for high
   places; at the same time He would not have them made sad.

   Bede: Or else, it is not mine to give to you, that is, to proud
   persons, for such as yet they were. It is prepared for other persons,
   and be ye other, that is, lowly, and it is prepared for you.

   41. And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with
   James and John.

   42. But Jesus called them to Him, and saith unto them, "Ye know that
   they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship
   over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.

   43. But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among
   you, shall be your minister:

   44. And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.

   45. For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
   minister, and to give His life a ransom for many."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: The other Apostles are indignant at seeing James and John
   seeking for honour; wherefore it is said, "And when the ten heard it,
   they began to be much displeased with James and John." For being
   influenced by human feelings, they were moved with envy; and their
   first displeasure arose from their seeing that they were not taken up
   by the Lord; before that time they were not displeased, because they
   saw that they themselves were honoured before other men. At this time
   the Apostles were thus imperfect, but afterwards they yielded the chief
   place one to another.

   Christ however cures them; first indeed by drawing them to Himself in
   order to comfort them; and this is meant, when it is said, "But Jesus
   called them to Him"; then by shewing them that to usurp honour, and to
   desire the chief place, belongs to Gentiles.

   Wherefore there follows: "And saith unto them, Ye know that they which
   are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship; and their
   great ones exercise authority over them."

   The great ones of the Gentiles thrust themselves into the chief place
   tyrannically and as lords.

   It goes on: "But so shall it not be among you."

   Bede: In which He teaches, that he is the greater, who is the less, and
   that he becomes the lord, who is servant of all: vain, therefore, was
   it both for the one party to seek for immoderate things, and the other
   to be annoyed at their desiring greater things, since we are to arrive
   at the height of virtue not by power but by humility.

   Then He proposes an example, that if they lightly regarded His words,
   His deeds might make them ashamed, saying, "For even the Son of man
   came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a
   ransom for many."

   Theophylact: Which is a greater thing than to minister. For what can be
   greater or more wonderful than that a man should die for him to whom he
   ministers? Nevertheless, this serving and condescension of humility was
   His glory, and that of all; for before He was made man, He was known
   only to the Angels; but now that He has become man and has been
   crucified, He not only has glory Himself, but also has taken up others
   to a participation in His glory, and ruled by faith over the whole
   world.

   Bede: He did not say, however, that He gave His life a ransom for all,
   but for many, that is, for those who would believe on Him.

   disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of
   Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

   47. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
   out, and say, "Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me."

   whole." And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in
   the way.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jerome: The name of the city agrees with the approaching Passion of our
   Lord; for it is said, "And they came to Jericho." Jericho means moon or
   anathema; but the failing of the flesh of Christ is the preparation of
   the heavenly Jerusalem.

   It goes on: "And as He went out of Jericho with His disciples, and a
   great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by
   the wayside begging."

   Bede: Matthew says, that there were two blind men sitting by the
   wayside, who cried to the Lord, and received their sight; but Luke
   relates that one blind man was enlightened by Him, with a like order of
   circumstances, as He was going into Jericho; where no one, at least no
   wise man, will suppose that the Evangelists wrote things contrary to
   one another, but that one wrote more fully, what another has left out.

   We must therefore understand that one of them was the more important,
   which appears from this circumstance, that Mark has related his name
   and the name of his father.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 65: It is for this reason that Mark
   wished to relate his case alone, because his receiving his sight had
   gained for the miracle a fame, illustrious in proportion to the extent
   of the knowledge of his affliction. But although Luke relates a miracle
   done entirely in the same way, nevertheless we must understand that a
   similar miracle was wrought on another blind man, and a similar method
   of the same miracle.

   It goes on: "And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began
   to cry out, and say, Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy upon me."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: The blind man calls the
   Lord, the Son of David, hearing the way in which the passing multitude
   praised Him, and feeling sure that the expectation of the prophets was
   fulfilled.

   There follows: "And many charged him that he should hold his peace."

   Origen, in Matt. tom. xvi, 13 [ed. note: these preceding words of
   Origen are necessary to make up the sense: "Next observe, that on the
   blind man's crying out, Thou Son of David, have mercy upon me, it was
   they who went before that charged him that he should hold his peace."
   see Luke 18:39]: As if he said, Those who were foremost in believing
   rebuked him when he cried, "Thou Son of David," that he might hold his
   peace, and cease to call Him by a contemptible name, when he ought to
   say, Son of God, have pity upon me. He however did not cease; wherefore
   it goes on: "But he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David,
   have mercy upon me;" and the Lord heard his cry; wherefore there
   follows: "And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called."

   But observe, that the blind man, of whom Luke speaks, is inferior to
   this one; for neither did Jesus call him, nor order him to be called,
   but He commanded him to be brought to Him, as though unable to come by
   himself; but this blind man by the command of our Lord is called to
   Him.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be
   of good comfort, rise, He calleth thee;" but he casting away his
   garment, comes to Him. It goes on: "And he casting away his garment,
   rose, and came to Jesus."

   Perchance, the garment of the blind man means the veil of blindness and
   poverty, with which he was surrounded, which he cast away and came to
   Jesus; and the Lord questions him, as he is approaching.

   Wherefore there follows: "And Jesus answered and said unto him, What
   will thou that I should do unto thee."

   Bede: Could He who was able to restore sight be ignorant of what the
   blind man wanted? His reason then for asking is that prayer may be made
   to Him; He puts the question, to stir up the blind man's heart to pray.

   Chrys., Hom. in Matt., 56: Or He asks, lest men should think that what
   He granted the man was not what he wanted. For it was His practice to
   make the good disposition of those who were to be cured known to all
   men, and then to apply the remedy, in order to stir up others to
   emulation, and to shew that he who was to be cured was worthy to obtain
   the grace.

   It goes on: "The blind man said unto Him, Lord, that I may receive my
   sight."

   Bede: For the blind man looks down upon every gift except light,
   because, whatever a blind man may possess, without light he cannot see
   what he possesses.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But Jesus, considering his ready will, rewards him with
   the fulfilment of his desire.

   Origen: Again, it is more worthy to say Rabboni, or, as it is in other
   places, Master, than to say Son of David; wherefore He given him
   health, not on his saying, Son of David, but when he said Rabboni.

   Wherefore there follows: "And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy
   faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and
   followed Him in the way."

   Theophylact: The mind of the blind man is grateful, for when he was
   made whole, he did not leave Jesus, but followed Him.

   Bede: In a mystical sense, however, Jericho, which means the moon,
   points out the waning of our fleeting race. The Lord restored sight to
   the blind man, when drawing near to Jericho, because coming in the
   flesh and drawing near to His Passion, He brought many to the faith;
   for it was not in the first years of His Incarnation, but in the few
   years before He suffered, that He shewed the mystery of the Word to the
   world.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But the blindness in part, brought upon the Jews [Rom
   11:25], will in the end be enlightened when He sends unto them the
   Prophet Elias.

   Bede: Now in that on approaching Jericho, He restored sight to one man,
   and on quitting it to two, He intimated, that before His Passion He
   preached only to one nation, the Jews, but after His Resurrection and
   Ascension, through His Apostles He opened the mysteries both of His
   Divinity and His Humanity to Jews and Gentiles. Mark indeed, in writing
   that one received his sight, refers to the saving of the Gentiles, that
   the figure might agree with the salvation of those, whom he instructed
   in the faith; but Matthew, who wrote his Gospel to the faithful among
   the Jews, because it was also to reach the knowledge of the Gentiles,
   fitly says that two received their sight, that He might teach us that
   the grace of faith belonged to each people.

   Therefore, as the Lord was departing with His disciples and a great
   multitude from Jericho, the blind man was sitting, begging by the
   way-side; that is, when the Lord ascended into heaven, and many of the
   faithful followed Him, yea when all the elect from the beginning of the
   world entered together with Him the gate of heaven [ed. note: This
   refers to the opinion that by the descent of our Lord into hell, the
   Patriarchs were freed from the limbus Patrum, where they had been
   confined, and were carried by Him into a place of happiness; see
   authorities quoted in Pearson on the Creed, Art. 5], presently the
   Gentile people began to have hope of its own illumination; for it now
   sits begging by the wayside, because it has not entered upon and
   reached the path of truth.

   Pseudo-Jerome: The people of the Jews also, because it kept the
   Scriptures and did not fulfill them, begs and starves by the wayside;
   but he cries out, "Son of David, have mercy upon me," because the
   Jewish people are enlightened by the merits of the Prophets. Many
   rebuke him that he may hold his peace, that is, sins and devils
   restrain the cry of the poor; and he cried the more, because when the
   battle waxes great, hands are to be lifted up with crying to the Rock
   of help, that is, Jesus of Nazareth.

   Bede: Again, the people of the Gentiles, having heard of the fame of
   the name of Christ, sought to be made a partaker of Him, but many spoke
   against Him, first the Jews, then also the Gentiles, lest the world
   which was to be enlightened should call upon Christ. The fury of those
   who attacked Him, however, could not deprive of salvation those who
   were fore-ordained to life. And He heard the blind man's cry as He was
   passing, but stood when He restored his sight, because by His Humanity
   He pitied him, who by the power of His Divinity has driven away the
   darkness from our mind; for in that Jesus was born and suffered for our
   sakes, He as it were passed by, because this action is temporal; but
   when God is said to stand, it means, that, Himself without change, He
   sets in order all changeable things. But the Lord calls the blind man,
   who cries to Him, when He sends the word of faith to the people of the
   Gentiles by preachers; and they call on the blind man to be of good
   cheer and to rise, and bid him come to the Lord, when by preaching to
   the simple, they bid them have hope of salvation, and rise from the
   sloth of vice, and gird themselves for a life of virtue.

   Again, he throws away his garment and leaps, who, throwing aside the
   bonds of the world, with unencumbered pace hastens to the Giver of
   eternal light.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Again, the Jewish people comes leaping, stripped of the
   old man, as a hart [red stag, male deer] leaping on the mountains, that
   is, laying aside sloth, it meditates on Patriarchs, Prophets, and
   Apostles on high, and raises itself to heights of holiness. How
   consistent also is the order of salvation. First we heard by the
   Prophets, then we cry aloud by faith, next we are called by Apostles,
   we rise up by penitence, we are stripped of our old garment by baptism,
   and of our choice we are questioned. Again, the blind man when asked
   requires, that he may see the will of the Lord.

   Bede: Therefore let us also imitate him, let us not seek for riches,
   earthly goods, or honours from the Lord, but for that Light, which we
   alone with the Angels can see, the way to which is faith; wherefore
   also Christ answers to the blind man, "Thy faith hath saved thee." But
   he sees and follows who works what his understanding tells him is good;
   for he follow Jesus, who understands and executes what is good, who
   imitates Him, who had no wish to prosper in this world, and bore
   reproach and derision. And because we have fallen from inward joy, by
   delight in the things of the body, He shews us what bitter feelings the
   return thither will cost us.

   Theophylact: Further, it says that he followed the Lord in the way,
   that is, in this life, because, after it, all are excluded who follow
   Him not here, by working His commandments.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or, this is the way of which He said, "I am the Way, the
   Truth, and the Life." This is the narrow way, which leads to the
   heights of Jerusalem, and Bethany, to the mount of Olives, which is the
   mount of light and consolation.

Chapter 11

   1. And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethpage and Bethany, at
   the mount of Olives, He sendeth forth two of His disciples,

   2. And saith unto them, "Go your way into the village over against you:
   and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied,
   whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.

   3. And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord
   hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither."

   4. And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without
   in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.

   5. And certain of them that stood there said unto them, "What do ye,
   loosing the colt?"

   6. And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let
   them go.

   7. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him;
   and He sat upon him.

   8. And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
   branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.

   9. And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,
   "Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:

   10. Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name
   of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chrys.: Now that the Lord had given sufficient proof of His virtue, and
   the cross was at hand, even at the door, He did those things which were
   about to excite them against Him with a greater openness; therefore
   although He had so often gone up to Jerusalem, He never however had
   done so in such a conspicuous manner as now.

   Theophlyact: That thus, if they were willing, they might recognize His
   glory, and by the prophecies, which were fulfilled concerning Him, know
   that He is very God; and that if they would not, they might receive a
   greater judgment, for not having believed so many wonderful miracles.
   Describing therefore this illustrious entrance, the Evangelist say,
   "And when they came nigh unto Jerusalem, and Bethany, at the mount of
   Olives, he sendeth forth two of His disciples."

   Bede, in Marc., 3, 41: Bethany is a little village or town by the side
   of mount Olivet, where Lazarus was raised from the dead. But in what
   way He sent His disciples and for what purpose is shewn in these words,
   "And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you."

   Theophylact: Now consider how many things the Lord foretold to His
   disciples, that they should find a colt; wherefore it goes on, "And as
   soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never
   man sat, loose him, and bring him;" and that they should be impeded in
   taking it, wherefore there follows, "And if any man say unto you, Why
   do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him;" and that on saying
   this, they should be allowed to take him; wherefore there follows, "And
   straightway he will send him hither;" and as the Lord had said, so it
   was fulfilled. Thus it goes on: "And they went their way, and found the
   colt tied by the door without, in a place where two ways meet; and they
   loose him."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan, ii, 66: Matthew says, an ass and a colt, the
   rest however do not mention the ass. Where then both may be the case,
   there is no disagreement, though one Evangelist mentions one thing, and
   a second mentions another; how much less should a question be raised,
   when one mentions one, and another mentions that same one and another.

   It goes on: "And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What
   do ye, loosing the colt? And they said unto them even as Jesus had
   commanded, and they let them take it," that is, the colt.

   Theophylact: But they would not have allowed this, if the Divine power
   had not been upon them, to compel them, especially, as they were
   country people and farmers, and yet allowed them to take away the colt.

   It goes on: "And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their
   garments on him; and He sat upon him."

   Pseudo-Chrys., Cat. in Marc. Oxon.: Not indeed that He was compelled by
   necessity to ride on a colt from the mount of Olives to Jerusalem, for
   He had gone over Judaea and all Galilee on foot, but this action of His
   is typical.

   It goes on: "And many spread their garments in the way;" that is, under
   the feet of the colt; "and others cut down branches off the trees, and
   strawed them in the way."

   Pseudo-Jerome: This, however, was rather done to honour Him, and as a
   Sacrament, than of necessity.

   It goes on: "and they that went before, and they that followed, cried,
   saying, Hosanna; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."

   Theophylact: For the multitude, until it was corrupted, knew what was
   its duty, for which reason each honoured Jesus according to his own
   strength. Wherefore they praised Him, and took up the hymns of the
   Levites, saying, Hosanna, which according to some is the same as "save
   me," but according to others means a hymn. I however suppose the former
   to be more probable, for there is in the 117th Psalm, "Save now, I
   beseech thee, O Lord," which in the Hebrew is, "Hosanna" [Ps 117:25].

   Bede: But "Hosanna" is a Hebrew word, made out of two, one imperfect
   the other perfect. For "save", or "preserve", is in their language,
   "hosy"; but "anna" is a supplicatory interjection, as in Latin, "heu",
   is an exclamation of grief.

   Pseudo-Jerome: They cry out Hosanna, that is, save us, that men might
   be saved by Him who was blessed, and was a conqueror and came in the
   name of the Lord, that is, of His Father, since the Father is so called
   because of the Son, and the Son, because of the Father.

   Psuedo-Chrys., Cat. in Marc. Oxon.: Thus then they give glory to God,
   saying, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord." They also
   bless the kingdom of Christ, saying, "Blessed by the kingdom of our
   father, David, which cometh."

   Theophylact: But they called the kingdom of Christ, that of David, both
   because Christ was descended from the seed of David, and because David
   means a man of a strong hand. For whose hand is stronger than the
   Lord's , by which so many and so great miracles were wrought.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Cat. in Marc. Oxon.: Wherefore also the prophets so
   often call Christ by the name of David, on account of the descent
   according to the flesh of Christ from David.

   Bede: Now we read in the Gospel of John that He fled into a mountain,
   lest they should make Him their king. Now, however, when He comes to
   Jerusalem to suffer, He does not shun those who call Him king, that He
   might openly teach them that He was King over an empire not temporal
   and earthly, but everlasting in the heavens, and that the path to this
   kingdom was through contempt of death.

   Observe, also, the agreement of the multitude with the saying of
   Gabriel, "The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David;"
   [Luke 1:32] that is, that He Himself may call by word and deed to a
   heavenly kingdom the nation to which David once furnished the
   government of a temporal rule.

   Pseudo-Chrys., Cat. in Marc. Oxon.: And further, they give glory to
   God, when they add, "Hosanna in the highest," that is, praise and glory
   be to the God of all, Who is in the highest.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or Hosanna, that is, save "in the highest" as well as in
   the lowest, that is, that the just be built on the ruin of Angels, and
   also that both those on the earth and those under the earth should be
   saved. In a mystical sense, also, the Lord approaches Jerusalem, which
   is the vision of peace,' in which happiness remains fixed and unmoved,
   being, as the Apostle says, the mother of all believers. [Gal 4:26]

   Bede: Bethany again means the house of obedience, because by teaching
   many before His Passion, he made for Himself a house of obedience; and
   it is said to be placed on the mount of Olives, because He cherishes
   His Church with the unction of spiritual gifts, and with the light of
   piety and knowledge. But He sent His disciples to a hold [ed. note:
   castellum], which was over against them, that is, He appointed doctors
   to penetrate into the ignorant parts of the whole world, into, as it
   were, the walls of the hold placed against them.

   Pseudo-Jerome: The disciples of Christ are called two by two, and sent
   two by two, since charity implies more than one, as it is written, "Woe
   to him that is alone." [Eccles 4:10] Two persons lead the Israelites
   out of Egypt: two bring down the bunch of grapes from the Holy Land,
   that men in authority might ever join together activity and knowledge,
   and bring forward two commandments from the Two Tables, and be washed
   from two fountains, and carry the ark of the Lord on two poles, and
   know the Lord between the two Cherubim, [p 223" /&gt; and sing to Him
   with both mind and spirit.

   Theophylact: The colt, however, was not necessary to Him, but He sent
   for it to shew that He would transfer Himself to the Gentiles.

   Bede: For the colt of the ass, wanton and unshackled, denotes the
   people of the nations, on whom no man had yet sat, because no wise
   doctor had, by teaching them the things of salvation, put upon them the
   bridle of correction, to oblige them to restrain their tongues from
   evil, or to compel them into the narrow path of life.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But "they found the colt tied by the door without,"
   because the Gentile people were bound by the chain of their sins before
   the door of faith, that is, without the Church.

   Ambrose, in Luc. 9, 6: Or else, they found it bound before the door,
   because whosoever is not in Christ is without, in the way; but he who
   is in Christ, is not without. He has added "in the way," or "in a place
   where two ways meet," where there is no certain possession for any man,
   not stall, nor food, nor stable; miserable is his service, whose rights
   are unfixed; for he who has not the one Master, has many. Strangers
   bind him that they may possess him, Christ looses him in order to keep
   him, for He knows that gifts are stronger ties than bonds.

   Bede: Or else, fitly did the colt stand in a place where two ways meet,
   because the Gentile people did not hold on in any certain road of life
   and faith, but followed in its error many doubtful paths of various
   sects.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or, in a place where two roads meet, that is, in the
   freedom of will, hesitating between life and death.

   Theophylact: Or else, in a place where two roads meet, that is, in this
   life, but it was loosed by the disciples, through faith and baptism.

   Pseudo-Jerome: "But some said, What do ye?" as if they would say, Who
   can remit sins?

   Theophylact: Or else, those who prevent them are the devils, who were
   weaker than the Apostles.

   Bede: Or else, the master of error, who resisted the teachers, when
   they came to save the Gentiles; but after that the power of the faith
   of the Lord appeared to believers, the faithful people were freed from
   the cavils of the adversaries, and were brought to the Lord, whom they
   bore in their hearts. But by the garments of the Apostles, which they
   put upon it, we may understand the teaching of virtues, or the
   interpretation of the Scriptures, or the various doctrines of the
   Church, by which they clothe the hearts of men, once naked and cold and
   fit them to become the seats of Christ.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, they put upon it their garments, that is, they
   bring to them the first robe of immortality by the Sacrament of
   Baptism. "And Jesus sat upon it," that is, began to reign in them, so
   that sin should not reign in their wanton flesh, but righteousness, and
   peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

   Again, "many spread their garments in the way," under the feet of the
   foal of the ass. What are feet, but those who carry, and the least
   esteemed, whom the Apostle has set to judge? [1 Cor 6:4] And these too,
   though they are not the back on which the Lord sat, yet are instructed
   by John with the soldiers.

   Bede: Or else, many strew their garments in the way, because the holy
   martyrs put off from themselves the garment of their own flesh, and
   prepare a way for the more simple servants of God with their own blood.
   Many also strew their garments in the way, because they tame their
   bodies with abstinence, that they may prepare a way for God to the
   mount, or may give good examples to those who follow them.

   And they cut down branches from the trees, who in the teaching of the
   truth cull the sentences of the Fathers from their words, and by their
   lowly preaching scatter them in the path of God, when He comes into the
   soul of the hearer.

   Theophylact: Let us also strew the way of our life with branches which
   we cut from the trees, that is, imitate the saints, for these are holy
   trees, from which, he who imitates their virtues cuts down branches.

   Pseudo-Jerome: "For the righteous shall flourish as a palm tree,"
   straitened in their roots, but spreading out wide with flowers and
   fruits; for they are a good odour unto Christ, and strew the way of the
   commandments of God with their good report. Those who went before are
   the prophets, and those who followed are the Apostles.

   Bede: And because all the elect, whether those who were able to become
   such in Judaea, or those who now are such in the Church, believed and
   now believe on the Mediator between God and man, both those who go
   before and those who follow cried out Hosanna.

   Theophylact: But both those of our deeds which go before and those
   which follow after must be done to the glory of God; for some in their
   past life make a good beginning, but their following life does not
   correspond with their former, neither does it end to the glory of God.

   11. And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when He
   had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come,
   He went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

   12. And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, He was hungry:

   13. And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, He came, if haply He
   might find any thing thereon: and when He came to it, He found nothing
   but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.

   14. And Jesus answered and said unto it, "No man eat fruit of thee
   hereafter for ever." And His disciples heard it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: As the time of His Passion approached, the Lord wished to
   approach to the place of His Passion, in order to intimate that He
   underwent death of His own accord: wherefore it is said, "And Jesus
   entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple." And by His going to the
   temple on first entering the city, He shews us beforehand a form of
   religion, which we are to follow, that if by chance we enter a place,
   where there is a house of prayer, we should first turn aside to it.

   We should also understand from this, that such was the poverty of the
   Lord, and so far was He from flattering man, that in so large a city,
   He found no one to be His host, no abiding place, but lived in a small
   country place with Lazarus and his sisters; for Bethany is a hamlet of
   the Jews.

   Wherefore there follows: "And when He had looked round about upon all
   things, (that is, to see whether any one would take Him in,) and now
   the eventide was come, He went out into Bethany with the twelve."

   Nor did He do this once only, but during all the five days, from the
   time that He came to Jerusalem, to the day of His Passion, He used
   always to do the same thing; during the day He taught in the temple,
   but at night, He went out and dwelt in the mount of Olives.

   It goes on, "And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, He
   was hungry."

   Chrys., in Matt. Hom., 87: How is it that He was hungry in the morning,
   as Matthew says, if it were not that by an economy He permitted it to
   His flesh?

   There follows, "And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, He came,
   if haply He might find any thing theron."

   Now it is evident that this expresses a conjecture of the disciples,
   who thought that it was for this reason that Christ came to the fig
   tree, and that it was cursed, because He found no fruit upon it.

   For it goes on: "And when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves;
   for the time of figs was not yet. And Jesus answered and said unto it,
   No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever."

   He therefore curses the fig tree for His disciples' sake, that they
   might have faith in Him. For He everywhere distributed blessings, and
   punished no one, yet at the same time, it was right to give them a
   proof of His chastising power, that they might learn that He could even
   cause the persecuting Jews to wither away; He was however unwilling to
   give this proof on men, wherefore He shewed them on a plant a sign of
   His power of punishing. This proves that He came to the fig tree
   principally for this reason, and not on account of His hunger, for who
   is so silly as to suppose that in the morning He felt so greatly the
   pains of hunger, or what prevented the Lord from eating before He left
   Bethany? Nor can it be said that the sight of the figs excited His
   appetite to hunger, for it was not the season of figs; and if He were
   hungry, why did He not seek food elsewhere, rather than from a fig-tree
   which could not yield fruit before its time? What punishment also did a
   fig tree deserve for not having fruit before its time? From all this
   then we may infer, that He wished to shew His power, that their minds
   might not be broken by His Passion.

   Theophylact: Wishing to shew His disciples that if He chose He could in
   a moment exterminate those who were about to crucify Him. In a mystical
   sense, however, the Lord entered into the temple, but came out of it
   again, to shew that He left it desolate, and open to the spoiler.

   Bede: Farther, He looks round about upon the hearts of all, and when in
   those who opposed the truth, He found no place to lay His head, He
   retires to the faithful, and takes up His abode with those who obey
   Him. For Bethany means, the house of obedience.

   Pseudo-Jerome: He went in the morning to the Jews, and visits us in the
   eventide of the world.

   Bede: Just in the same way as He speaks parables, so also His deeds are
   parables; therefore He comes hungry to seek fruit off the fig tree, and
   though He knew the time of figs was not yet, He condemns it to
   perpetual barrenness, that He might shew that the Jewish people could
   not be saved through the leaves, that is, the words of righteousness
   which it had, without fruit, that is, good works, but should be cut
   down and cast into the fire.

   Hungering therefore, that is, desiring the salvation of mankind, He saw
   the fig tree, which is, the Jewish people, having leaves, or, the words
   of the Law and the Prophets, and He sought upon it the fruit of good
   works, by teaching them, by rebuking them, by working miracles, and He
   found it not, and therefore condemned it. Do thou too, unless thou
   wouldest be condemned by Christ in the judgment, beware of being a
   barren tree, but rather offer to Christ the fruit of piety which He
   requires.

   Chrys.: We may also say, in another sense, that the Lord sought for
   fruit on the fig tree before its time, and not finding it, cursed it,
   because all who fulfil the commandments of the Law, are said to bear
   fruit in their own time, as, for instance, that commandment, "Thou
   shalt not commit adultery;" but he who not only abstains from adultery
   but remains a virgin, which is a greater thing, excels them in virtue.
   But the Lord exacts from the perfect not only the observance of virtue,
   but also that they bear fruit over and above the commandments.

   15. And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and
   began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and
   overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that
   sold doves;

   16. And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through
   the temple.

   17. And He taught, saying unto them, "Is it not written, My house shall
   be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den
   of thieves."

   18. And the Scribes and Chief Priests heard it, and sought how they
   might destroy Him: for they feared Him, because all the people was
   astonished at His doctrine.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: What the Lord had done in figure, when He cursed the barren fig
   tree, He now shews more openly, by casting out the wicked from the
   temple. For the fig tree was not in fault, in not having fruit before
   its time, but the priests were blameable; wherefore it is said, "And
   they come to Jerusalem; and Jesus went into the temple, and began to
   cast out them that sold and bought in the temple." Nevertheless, it is
   probable that He found them buying and selling in the temple things
   which were necessary for its ministry. If then the Lord forbids men to
   carry on in the temple worldly matters, which they might freely do any
   where else, how much more do they deserve a greater portion of the
   anger of Heaven, who carry on in the temple consecrated to Him those
   things, which are unlawful wherever they may be done.

   It goes on: "and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers."

   Theophylact: He calls moneychangers, changers of a particular sort of
   money, for the word means a small brass coin.

   Bede: Because the Holy Spirit appeared over the Lord in the shape of a
   dove, the gifts of the Holy Spirit are fitly pointed out under the name
   of doves. The Dove therefore is sold, when the laying on of hands by
   which the Holy Spirit is received is sold for a price. Again, He
   overturns the seats of them who sell doves, because they who sell
   spiritual grace, are deprived of their priesthood, either before men,
   or in the eyes of God.

   Theophylact: But if a man by sinning gives up to the devil the grace
   and purity of baptism, he has sold his Dove, and for this reason is
   cast out of the temple.

   There follows: "And would not suffer that any man should carry any
   vessel through the temple."

   Bede: He speaks of those vessels which were carried there for the
   purpose of merchandise. But God forbid that it should be taken to mean,
   that the Lord cast out of the temple, or forbade men to bring into it,
   the vessels consecrated to God; for here He shews a type of the
   judgment to come, for He thrusts away the wicked from the Church, and
   restrains them by His everlasting word from ever again coming in to
   trouble the Church. Furthermore, sorrow, sent into the heart from
   above, takes away from the souls of the faithful those sins which were
   in them, and Divine grace assists them so that they should never again
   commit them.

   It goes on: "And He taught, saying unto them, My house shall be called
   of all nations the house of prayer."

   Pseudo-Jerome: [This] according to Isaiah [Isa 56:7]. "But ye have made
   it a den of thieves," according to Jeremiah. [Jer 7:11]

   Bede: He says, "to all nations," not to the Jewish nation alone, nor in
   the city of Jerusalem alone, but over the whole world; and he does not
   say a house of bulls, goats, and rams, but of prayer.

   Theophylact: Further, He calls the temple, "a den of thieves," on
   account of the money gained there; for thieves always troop together
   for gain. Since then they sold those animals which were offered in
   sacrifice for the sake of gain, He called them thieves.

   Bede: For they were in the temple for this purpose, either that they
   might persecute with corporal pains those who did not bring gifts, or
   spiritually kill those who did. The mind and conscience of the faithful
   is also the temple and the house of God, but if it puts forth perverse
   thoughts, to the hurt of any one, it may be said that thieves haunt it
   as a den; therefore the mind of the faithful becomes the den of a
   thief, when leaving the simplicity of holiness, it plans that which may
   hurt others.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan, ii, 67: John, however, relates this in a very
   different order, wherefore it is manifest that not once only, but
   twice, this was done by the Lord, and that the first time was related
   by John, the last, by all the other three.

   Theophylact: Which also turns to the greater condemnation of the Jews,
   because though the Lord did this so many times, nevertheless they did
   not correct their conduct.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan, ii, 68: In this again, Mark does not keep the
   same order as Matthew; because however Matthew connects the facts
   together by this sentence, "And He left them, and went out of the city
   into Bethany," [Matt 21:17] returning from whence in the morning,
   according to his relation, Christ cursed the tree, therefore it is
   supposed with greater probability that he rather has kept to the order
   of time, as to the ejection from the temple of the buyers and sellers.
   Mark therefore passed over what was done the first day when He entered
   into the temple, and on remembering it inserted it, when he had said
   that He found nothing on the fig tree but leaves, which was done on the
   second day, as both testify.

   Gloss: But the Evangelist shews what effect the correction of the Lord
   had on the ministers of the temple, when he adds: "and the Scribes and
   Chief Priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him;"
   according to that saying of Amos: "They hate him that rebuketh in the
   gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly." [Amos 5:10] From
   this wicked design, however, they were kept back for a time solely by
   fear.

   Wherefore it is added, "For they feared Him, because all the people
   were astonished at His doctrine. For He taught them as one having
   authority, and not as the Scribes" and Pharisees, as is said elsewhere.

   19. And when even was come, He went out of the city.

   20. And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried
   up from the roots.

   21. And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto Him, "Master, behold,
   the fig tree which Thou cursedst is withered away."

   22. And Jesus answering saith unto them, "Have faith in God.

   23. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
   mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not
   doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith.

   24. Therefore, I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
   pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

   25. And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any:
   that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
   trespasses.

   26. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
   heaven forgive your trespasses."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: The Lord, leaving darkness behind Him in the hearts of
   the Jews, went out, as the sun, from that city to another which is
   well-disposed and obedient. And this is what is meant, when it is said,
   "And when even was come, He went out of the city."

   But the sun sets in one place, rises in another, for the light, taken
   from the Scribes, shines in the Apostles; wherefore He returns into the
   city; on which account there is added, "And in the morning, as they
   passed by, (that is, going into the city,) they saw the fig tree dried
   up from the root."

   Theophylact: The greatness of the miracle appears in the drying up so
   juicy and green a tree. But though Matthew says that the fig tree was
   at once dried up, and that the disciples on seeing it wondered, there
   is no reason for perplexity, though Mark now says, that the disciples
   saw the fig tree dried up on the morrow; for what Matthew says must be
   understood to mean that they did not see it at once, but on the next
   day.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan, ii, 68: The meaning is not that it dried up at
   the time, when they saw it, but immediately after the word of the Lord;
   for they saw it, not beginning to dry up, but completely dried up; and
   they thus understood that it had withered immediately after our Lord
   spoke.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Now the fig tree withered from the roots is the
   synagogue withered from Cain, and the rest, from whom all the blood
   from Abel up to Zechariah is required.

   Bede: Further, the fig tree was dried up from the roots to shew that
   the nation was impious not only for a time and in part, and was to be
   smitten forever, not merely to be afflicted by the attacks of nations
   from without and then to be freed, as had often been done; or else it
   was dried up from the roots, to shew that is was stripped not only of
   the external favour of man, but altogether of the favour of heaven
   within it; for it lost both its life in heaven, and its country on
   earth.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Peter perceives the dry root, which is cut off, and has
   been replaced by the beautiful and fruitful olive, called by the Lord.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto Him,
   Master, behold, the fig tree which Thou cursedst is withered away."

   Chrys.: The wonder of the disciples was the consequence of imperfect
   faith, for this was no great thing for God to do; since then they did
   not clearly know His power, their ignorance made them break out into
   wonder.

   And therefore it is added, "And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have
   faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto
   this mountain," &c. That is; Thou shalt not only be able to dry up a
   tree, but also to change a mountain by they command and order.

   Theophylact: Consider the Divine mercy, how it confers on us, if we
   approach Him in faith, the power of miracles, which He Himself
   possesses by nature, so that we should be able even to change
   mountains.

   Bede: The Gentiles, who have attacked the Church, are in the habit of
   objecting to us, that we have never had full faith in God, for we have
   never been able to change mountains. It could, however, be done, if
   necessity called for it, as once we read that it was done by the
   prayers of the blessed Father Gregory of Neocaesarea, Bishop of Pontus,
   by which a mountain left as much space of ground for the inhabitants of
   a city as they wanted.

   Chrys.: Or else, as He did not dry up the fig tree for its own sake,
   but for a sign that Jerusalem should come to destruction, in order to
   shew His power, in the same way we must also understand the promise
   concerning the mountain, though a removal of this sort is not
   impossible with God.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Christ then who is the mountain, which grew from the
   stone, cut out without hands, is taken up and cast into the sea, when
   the Apostles with justice say, Let us turn ourselves to other nations,
   [Acts 13:46] since ye judged yourselves unworthy of hearing the word of
   God.

   Bede: Or else, because the devil is often on account of his pride
   called by the name of a mountain, this mountain, at the command of
   those who are strong in the faith, is taken up from the earth and cast
   into the sea, whenever, at the preaching of the word of God by the holy
   doctors, the unclean spirit is expelled from the hearts of those who
   are fore-ordained to life, and is allowed to exert the tyranny of his
   power over the troubled and embittered souls of the faithless. At which
   time, he rages the more fiercely, the more he grieves at being turned
   away from hurting the faithful.

   It goes on: "Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire,
   when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them."

   Theophylact: For whosoever sincerely believes evidently lifts up his
   heart to God, and is joined to Him, and his burning heart feels sure
   that he has received what he asked for, which he who has experienced
   will understand; and those persons appear to me to experience this, who
   attend to the measure and the manner of their prayers. For this reason
   the Lord says, "Ye shall receive whatsoever ye ask in faith;" for he
   who believes that he is altogether in the hands of God, and interceding
   with tears, feels that he as it were has hold of the feet of the Lord
   in prayer, he shall receive what he has rightly asked for. Again, would
   you in another way receive what you ask for? Forgive your brother, if
   he has in any way sinned against you; this is also what is added: "And
   when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your
   Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Mark has, as he is wont, expressed seven verses of the
   Lord's prayer in one prayer. But what can he, whose sins are all
   forgiven, require more, save that he may persevere in what has been
   granted unto him.

   Bede: But we must observe that there is a difference in those who pray;
   he who has perfect faith, which worketh by love, can by his prayer or
   even his command remove spiritual mountains, as Paul did with Elymas
   the sorcerer. But let those who are unable to mount up to such a height
   of perfection pray that their sins should be forgiven them, and they
   shall obtain what they pray for, provided that they themselves first
   forgive those who have sinned against them.

   If however they disdain to do this, not only shall they be unable to
   perform miracles by their prayers, but they shall not even be able to
   obtain pardon for their sins, which is implied in what follows; "But if
   ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive
   your trespasses."

   27. And they come again to Jerusalem: and as He was walking in the
   temple, there come to Him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the
   elders,

   28. And say unto Him, "By what authority doest thou these things? and
   who gave thee this authority to do these things?"

   29. And Jesus answered and said unto them, "I will also ask of you one
   question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do
   these things.

   30. The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me."

   31. And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
   heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

   32. But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men
   counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.

   33. And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus
   answering saith unto them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I
   do these things."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: They were angry with the Lord, for having cast out of the
   temple those who had made it a place of merchandize, and therefore they
   come up to Him, to question and tempt Him.

   Wherefore it is said: "And they come again to Jerusalem: and as He was
   walking in the temple, there come to Him the Chief Priests, and the
   Scribes, and the elders, and say unto Him, By what authority doest thou
   these things? and who gave thee authority to do these things?"

   As if they had said, Who art thou that doest these things? Dost thou
   make thyself a doctor, and ordain thyself Chief Priest?

   Bede: And, indeed, when they say, "By what authority doest thou these
   things," they doubt its being the power of God, and wish it to be
   understood that what He did was the devil's work. When they add also,
   "Who gave thee this authority," they evidently deny that He is the Son
   of God, since they believe He works miracles, not by His own but by
   another's power.

   Theophylact: Further, they said this, thinking to bring Him to
   judgment, so that if He said, by mine own power, they might lay hold
   upon Him; but if He said, by the power of another, they might make the
   people leave Him, for they believed Him to be God. But the Lord asks
   them concerning John, not without a reason, nor in a sophisticated way,
   but because John had borne witness of Him.

   Wherefore there follows: "And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will
   also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by
   what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, was it from
   heaven, or of me? answer me."

   Bede: The Lord might indeed have confuted the cavils of his tempters by
   a direct answer, but prudently puts them a question, that they might be
   condemned either by their silence or their speaking, which is evident
   from what is added, "And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we
   shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?"

   As if He had said, He whom you confess to have had his prophecy from
   heaven bore testimony of Me, and ye have heard from him, by what
   authority I do these things.

   It goes on: "But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people."

   They saw then that whatever they answered, they should fall into a
   snare; fearing to be stoned, they feared still more the confession of
   the truth.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot
   tell."

   Pseudo-Jerome: They envied the Lamp, and were in the dark, wherefore it
   is said, "I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed; his enemies will I
   clothe with shame." [Ps 131:17-18]

   There follows: "And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell
   you by what authority I do these things."

   Bede: As if He had said, I will not tell you what I know, since ye will
   not confess what ye know. Further, we must observe that knowledge is
   hidden from those who seek it, principally for two reasons, namely,
   when he who seeks for it either has not sufficient capacity to
   understand what he seeks for, or when through contempt for the truth,
   or some other reason, he is unworthy of having that for which he seeks
   opened to him.

Chapter 12

   1. And He began to speak unto them by parables. "A certain man planted
   a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and dug a place for the winefat,
   and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far
   country.

   2. And at the season he sent to husbandmen a servant, that he might
   receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.

   3. And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

   4. And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast
   stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully
   handled.

   5. And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
   beating some, and killing some.

   6. Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him also
   last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.'

   7. But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come,
   let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.'

   8. And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.

   9. What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and
   destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.

   10. And have ye not read this Scripture; The stone which the builders
   rejected is become the head of the corner:

   11. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?' "

   12. And they sought to lay hold on Him, but feared the people: for they
   knew that He had spoken the parable against them: and they left Him,
   and went their way.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss: After the Lord had closed the mouths of His tempters by a wise
   question, He next shews their wickedness in a parable.

   Wherefore it is said: "And He began to speak unto them by parable. A
   certain man planted a vineyard."

   Pseudo-Jerome: God the Father is called a man by a human conception.
   The vineyard is the house of Israel; the hedge is the guardianship of
   Angels; the winefat is the law, the tower is the temple, and the
   husbandmen, the priests.

   Bede, in Marc., 3, 42: Or else, the hedge is the wall of the city, the
   winefat is the altar, or those winefats, by which three psalms receive
   their name.

   Theophylact: Or, the hedge is the law, which prohibited their mingling
   with strangers.

   There follows: "And went into a far country."

   Bede: Not by any change of place, but He seemed to go away from the
   vineyard, that He might leave the husbandmen to act on their own
   freewill.

   It goes on: "And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant,
   that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the
   vineyard."

   Pseudo-Jerome: The servants who were sent were the prophets, the fruit
   of the vineyard is obedience; some of the prophets were beaten, others
   wounded, others slain.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him
   away empty."

   Bede: By the servant who was first sent we must understand Moses, but
   they beat him, and sent him away empty, because "they angered Moses in
   the tents." [Ps 106:6]

   There follows: "And again he sent unto them another servant, and they
   wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled."

   This other servant means David and the other Psalmists, but they
   wounded Him in the head and shamefully handled him, because they
   despised the songs of the Psalmists, and rejected David himself,
   saying, "What portion have we in David?" [1 Kings 12,16]

   It goes on: "And he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
   beating some, and killing some."

   By the third servant and his companions, understand the band of the
   prophets. But which of the prophets did they not persecute? In these
   three kinds of servants, as the Lord Himself elsewhere pronounces, may
   be included in a figure all the doctors under the law, when He says,
   "that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of
   Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me." [Luke
   24:44]

   Theophylact: Or else, by the first servant, understand the prophets who
   lived about the time of Elias, for Zedekiah the false prophet beat
   Micaiah [2 Chron. 18:23]; and by the second servant whom they wounded
   in the head, that is, evil entreated, we may understand the prophets
   who lived about the time of Hosea and Isaiah; but by the third servant
   understand the prophets who flourished about the time of Daniel and
   Ezekiel.

   It goes on: "Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent
   him also last unto them, saying, Perchance they will reverence my son."

   Pseudo-Jerome: The well-beloved son and the last is the Only-begotten;
   and in that He says, "They will reverence my son," He speaks in irony.

   Bede: Or else, this is not said in ignorance, but God is said to doubt,
   that freedom of will may be left to man.

   Theophylact: Or else, He said this not as thought He were ignorant of
   what was to happen, but to shew what it was right and fitting that they
   should do.

   "But those husbandmen said amongst themselves, This is the heir, come,
   let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."

   Bede: The Lord proves most clearly that the chiefs of the Jews did not
   crucify the Son of God through ignorance, but through envy; for they
   understood that this was He to whom it was said, "I will give thee the
   heathen for thine inheritance." [Ps 2:8]

   But these evil husbandmen strove to seize upon it by slaying Him, when
   the Jews crucifying Him tried to extinguish the faith which is by Him,
   and rather to bring forward their own righteousness which is by the
   Law, and to thrust it on the nations, and to imbue them with it.

   There follows: "And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of
   the vineyard."

   Theophylact: That is, without Jerusalem, for the Lord was crucified out
   of the city.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, they case Him out of the vineyard, that is, out
   of the people, saying "Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil." [John
   8:48]

   Bede: Or, as far as in them lay, they cast Him out of their own
   borders, and gave Him up to the Gentiles that they might receive Him.

   There follows: "What then will the Lord of the vineyard do? he will
   come and destroy those husbandmen, and give the vineyard unto others."

   Augustine, de Con Evan, ii, 70: Matthew indeed subjoins that they
   answered and said, "He will miserably destroy those wicked men," [Matt
   21:41] which Mark here says was not their answer, but that the Lord
   after putting the question, as it were answered Himself. But we may
   easily understand either that their answer was subjoined without the
   insertion of, "they answered," or "they said," which at the same time
   was implied; or else, that their answer, being the truth, was
   attributed to the Lord, since He also Himself gave this answer
   concerning them, being the Truth.

   Theophylact: The Lord of the vineyard then is the Father of the Son who
   was slain, and the Son Himself is He who was slain, who will destroy
   those husbandmen, by giving them up to the Romans, and who will give
   the people to other husbandmen, that is, to the Apostles.

   Read the Acts of the Apostles, and you will find three thousand, and
   five thousand on a sudden believing and bearing fruit to God.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, the vineyard is given to others, that is, to
   those who come from the east, and from the west, and from the south,
   and from the north, and who sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in
   the kingdom of heaven.

   Bede: But that this was done by Divine interposition He affirms, by
   immediately afterwards adding, "And have ye not read this Scripture,
   The stone which the builders refused is become the headstone in the
   corner?"

   As if He had said, how is this prophecy to be fulfilled, save in that
   Christ, being rejected and slain by you, is to be preached to the
   Gentiles, who will believe on Him? Thus then as a corner stone, He will
   found the two people on Himself, and of the two people will build for
   Himself a city of the faithful, one temple. For the masters of the
   synagogue, whom He had just called husbandmen, He now calls "builders",
   because the same persons, who seemed to cultivate His people, that they
   might bear the fruits of life, like a vineyard, were also commanded to
   construct and adorn this people, to be, as it were, a house worthy to
   have God for its inhabitant.

   Theophylact: The stone then which the builders refused, the same has
   become the head-stone of the corner, that is, of the Church. For the
   Church is, as it were, the corner, joining together Jews and Gentiles;
   and this corner has been made by the Lord, and is wonderful in our
   eyes, that is, in the eyes of the faithful; for miracles meet with
   detraction from the faithless.

   The Church indeed is wonderful, as it were resting on wonders, for the
   Lord worked with the Apostles, and confirmed the word with signs. And
   this is what is meant, when it is said, "This was the Lord's doing, and
   it is marvellous in our eyes."

   Pseudo-Jerome: This rejected stone, which is borne by that corner where
   the lamb and the bread met in the supper, ending the Old and beginning
   the New Testament, does things marvellous in our eyes [Ps 118:23] as
   the topaz.

   Bede: But the Chief Priests shewed that those things which the Lord had
   spoken were true; which is proved from what follows: "And they sought
   to lay hold on him;" for He Himself is the heir, whose unjust death He
   said was to be revenged by the Father. Again, in a moral sense, each of
   the faithful, when the Sacrament of Baptism is intrusted to him,
   receives on hire a vineyard, which he is to cultivate. But the servant
   sent to him is evil intreated, beaten, and cast out, when the word is
   heard by him and despised, or, what is worse, even blasphemed; further,
   he kills, as far as in him lies, the heir, who has trampled under foot
   the Son of God.

   The evil husbandman is destroyed; and the vineyard given to another,
   when the humble shall be enriched with that gift of grace, which the
   proud man has scorned. And it happens daily in the Church, that the
   Chief Priests wishing to lay hands on Jesus, are held back by the
   multitude, when some on, who is a brother only in name, either blushes
   or fears to attack the unity of the faith of the Church, and of its
   peace, though he loves it not, on account of the number of good
   brethren who dwell together within it.

   13. And they send unto Him certain of the Pharisees and of the
   Herodians, to catch Him in His words.

   14. And when they were come, they say unto Him, "Master, we know that
   thou art true, and carest for no man; for thou regardest not the person
   of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give
   tribute to Caesar, or not?

   15. Shall we give, or shall we not give?" But He, knowing their
   hypocrisy, said unto them, "Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I
   may see it."

   16. And they brought it. And He saith unto them, "Whose is this image
   and superscription?" And they said unto Him, "Caesar's."

   17. And Jesus answering said unto them, "Render to Caesar the things
   that are Caesar's , and to God the things that are God's ." And they
   marvelled at Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: The Chief Priests though they sought to take Him, feared the
   multitude, and therefore they endeavored to effect what they could not
   do of themselves, by means of earthly powers, that they might
   themselves appear to be guiltless of His death.

   And therefore it is said, "And they send unto Him certain of the
   Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch Him in His words."

   Theophylact: We have said elsewhere of the Herodians, that they were a
   certain new heresy, who said that Herod was the Christ, because the
   succession of the kingdom of Judah had failed. Others however say that
   the Herodians were the soldiers of Herod, whom the Pharisees brought as
   witnesses of the words of Christ, that they might take Him, and lead
   Him away. But observe how in their wickedness they wished to deceive
   Christ by flattery; for it goes on: "Master, we know that thou art
   true."

   Pseudo-Jerome: For they questioned Him with honied words, and they
   surrounded Him as bees, who carry honey in their mouth, but a sting in
   their tail.

   Bede: But this bland and crafty question was intended to induce Him in
   His answer rather to fear God than Caesar, and to say that tribute
   should not be paid, so that the Herodians immediately on hearing it
   might hold Him to be an author of sedition against the Romans.

   And therefore they add, "And carest for no man: for thou regardest not
   the person of any."

   Theophylact: So that thou wilt not honour Caesar, that is, against the
   truth.

   Therefore they add, "But teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful
   to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not
   give?"

   For their whole plot was one which had a precipice on both sides, so
   that if He said that it was lawful to give tribute to Caesar, they
   might provoke the people against Him, as though He wished to reduce the
   nation itself to slavery; but if He said, that it was not lawful, they
   might accuse Him, as though He was stirring up the people against
   Caesar; the Fountain of wisdom escaped their snares.

   Wherefore there follows: "But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto
   them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. And they
   brought it."

   Bede: A denarius was a piece of money, accounted equal to ten smaller
   coins, and bearing the image of Caesar; wherefore there follows: "And
   He saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they
   said unto Him, Caesar's .

   Let those who think that our Saviour asked the question through
   ignorance and not by an economy, learn from this that He might have
   known whose image it was; but He puts the question, in order to return
   them a fitting answer.

   Wherefore there follows: "And Jesus answering said unto them, Render
   unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's , and unto God the things that
   are God's ."

   Theophylact: As if He had said, Give what bears an image to him whose
   image it bears, that is, the penny to Caesar; for we can both pay
   Caesar his tribute, and offer to God what is His own.

   Bede: That is, tithes, first-fruits, oblations, and victims. In the
   same way as He gave tribute both for Himself and Peter, He also gave to
   God the things that are God's, doing the will of his Father.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Render to Caesar the money bearing his image, which is
   collected for him, and render yourselves willingly up to God, for the
   light of thy countenance, O Lord [Ps 4:6], and not of Caesar's, is
   stamped upon us.

   Theophylact: The inevitable wants of our bodies is as Caesar unto each
   of us; the Lord therefore orders that there should be given to the body
   its own, that is, food and raiment, and to God the things that are
   God's. It goes on: "And they marvelled at Him." They who ought to have
   believed, wondered at such great wisdom, because they had found no
   place for their craftiness.

   18. Then come unto Him the Sadducees, which say there is no
   resurrection; and they asked Him, saying,

   19. "Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his
   wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take
   his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

   20. Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying
   left no seed.

   21. And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and
   the third likewise.

   22. And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died
   also.

   23. In the resurrection, therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife
   shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.' "

   24. And Jesus answering, said unto them, "Do ye not therefore err,
   because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God?

   25. For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are
   given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.

   26. And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the
   book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God
   of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?'

   27. He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye
   therefore do greatly err."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: After that our Lord has prudently escaped the crafty temptation
   of the Pharisees, it is shewn how He also confounds the Sadducees, who
   tempt Him.

   Wherefore it is said: "Then come unto Him the Sadducees, which say
   there is no resurrection."

   Theophylact: A certain heretical sect of the Jews called Sadducees
   denied the resurrection, and said that there was neither angel nor
   spirit. These then coming to Jesus, craftily proposed to Him a certain
   tale, in order to shew that no resurrection should take place, or had
   taken place; and therefore there is added, "And they asked Him, saying,
   Master." And in this tale they lay down that seven men had married one
   woman, in order to make men draw back from belief in the resurrection.

   Bede: And fitly do they frame such a fable in order to prove the
   madness of those who assert the resurrection of the body. Such a thing
   however might really have happened at some time or other among them.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But in a mystical sense: what can this woman, leaving no
   seed to seven brothers, and last of all dying, mean except the Jewish
   synagogue, deserted by the seven-fold Spirit, which filled those seven
   patriarchs, who did not leave to her the seed of Abraham, that is,
   Jesus Christ?

   For although a Son was born to them, nevertheless He was given to us
   Gentiles. This woman was dead to Christ, nor shall she be joined in the
   resurrection to any patriarch of the seven; for by the number seven is
   meant the whole company of the faithful. Thus it is said contrariwise
   by Isaiah, "Seven women shall take hold of one man;" [Isa 4:1] that is,
   the seven Churches, which the Lord loves, reproves, and chastises,
   adore Him with one faith.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And Jesus answering, said unto them, Do ye not
   therefore err, not knowing the Scripture, neither the power of God?"

   Theophylact: As if He had said, Ye understand not what sort of a
   resurrection the Scriptures announce; for ye believe that there will be
   a restoration of our bodies, such as they are now, but it shall not be
   so. Thus then ye know not the Scriptures; neither again do ye know the
   power of God; for ye consider it as a difficult thing, saying, How can
   the limbs, which have been scattered, be united together and joined to
   the soul? But this in respect to the Divine power is as nothing.

   There follows: "For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither
   marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in
   heaven;" as if He had said, there will be a certain heavenly and
   angelic restoration to life, when there shall be no more decay, and we
   shall remain unchanged; and for this reason marriage shall cease. For
   marriage now exists on account of our decay, that we may be carried on
   by succession of our race, and not fail; but then we shall be as the
   Angels, who need no succession by marriage, and never come to an end.

   Bede: We must here consider that the Latin custom does not answer to
   the Greek idiom. For properly different words are used for the marriage
   of men, and that of women; but here we may simply understand that,
   "marry," is meant of men, and "given in marriage" of women.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Thus then they do not understand the Scripture, in that
   in the resurrection, men shall be as the Angels of God, that is, no man
   there dies, no one is born, no infant is there, no old men.

   Theophylact: In another way also they are deceived, not understanding
   the Scriptures; for if they had understood them, they should also have
   understood how by the Scriptures the resurrection of the dead may be
   proved.

   Wherefore He adds, "And as touching the dead, that they rise, have ye
   not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him,
   saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
   Jacob?"

   Pseudo-Jerome: But I say, "in the bush," which is an image of you; for
   in it the fire was kindled, but it did not consume its thorns; so my
   words set you on fire, but do not burn off your thorns, which have
   grown under the curse.

   Theophylact: But I say, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
   the God of Jacob."

   As if He had said, "The God of the living," wherefore He adds, "He is
   not the God of the dead, but of the living;" for He did not say, I have
   been, but "I am," as if they had been present. But some one perhaps
   will say, that God spake this only of the soul of Abraham, not of his
   body; to which I answer, that Abraham implies both, that is, soul and
   body, so that He also is the God of the body, and the body lives with
   God, that is, in God's ordinance.

   Bede: Or else; because after proving that the soul remained after
   death, (for God could not be God of those who did not exist at all,)
   the resurrection of the body also might be inferred as a consequence,
   since it had done good and evil with the soul.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But when He says, "The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
   and the God of Jacob;" by naming God thrice, He implied the Trinity.
   But when He says, "He is not the God of the dead," by naming again the
   One God, He implies One Substance. But they live who make good the
   portion, which they had chosen; and they are dead, who have lost what
   they had made good. "Ye therefore do greatly err."

   Gloss.: That is, because they contradicted the Scriptures, and
   derogated from the power of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   28. And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
   together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked Him,
   "Which is the first commandment of all?"

   29. And Jesus answered him, "The first of all the commandments is,
   Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

   30. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
   all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is
   the first commandment.

   31. And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor
   as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."

   32. And the scribe said unto Him, "Well, Master, thou hast said the
   truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but He:

   33. And to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding,
   and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his
   neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and
   sacrifices."

   34. And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, He said unto him,
   "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." And no man after that durst
   ask Him any question.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: After that the Lord confuted the Pharisees, and the Sadducees,
   who tempted Him, it is here shewn how He satisfied the Scribe who
   questioned Him.

   Wherefore it is said, "And one of the scribes came, and having heard
   them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well,
   asked Him, Which is the first commandment of all?"

   Pseudo-Jerome: This question is only that which is a problem common to
   all skilled in the law, namely, that the commandments are differently
   set forth in Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. Wherefore He brought
   forward not one but two commandments, by which, as by two paps rising
   on the breast of the bride, our infancy is nourished.

   And therefore there is added, "And Jesus answered him, The first of all
   the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God." He
   mentions the first and greatest commandment of all; this is that to
   which each of us must give the first place in his heart, as the only
   foundation of piety, that is, the knowledge and confession of the
   Divine Unity, with the practice of good works, which is perfected in
   the love of God and our neighbour.

   Wherefore there is added, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
   thy heart, and with all thy mind, and with all thy soul, and with all
   thy strength: this is the first commandment."

   Theophylact: See how He has enumerated all the powers of the soul; for
   there is a living power in the soul, which He explains, when He says,
   "With all thy soul," and to this belong anger and desire, all of which
   He will have us give to Divine love.

   There is also another power, which is called natural, to which belong
   nutriment and growth, and this also is all to be given to God, for
   which reason He says, "With all thy heart."

   There is also another power, the rational, which He calls the mind, and
   that too is to be given whole to God.

   Gloss.: The words which are added, "And with all thy strength," may be
   referred to the bodily powers.

   It goes on: "And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
   neighbour as thyself."

   Theophylact: He says that it is like, because these two commandments
   are harmonious one with the other, and mutually contain the other. For
   he who loves God, loves also His creature; but the chief of His
   creatures is man, wherefore he who loves God ought to love all men. But
   he who loves his neighbor, who so often offends him, ought much more to
   love Him, who is ever giving him benefits. And therefore on account of
   the connection between these commandments, He adds, "There is none
   other commandment greater than these."

   It goes on: "And the Scribe said unto Him, Well, Master, thou hast said
   the truth: for there is one God, and there is none other but He: and to
   love Him with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the
   understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as
   himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."

   Bede: He shews when he says, "this is greater than all sacrifices,"
   that a grave question was often debated between the scribes and
   Pharisees, which was the first commandment, or the greatest of the
   Divine law; that is, some praised offerings and sacrifices, others
   preferred acts of faith and love, because many of the fathers before
   the law pleased God by that faith only, which works by love. This
   scribe shews that he was of the latter opinion.

   But it continues: "And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, He
   said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God."

   Theophylact: By which He shews that he was not perfect, for He did not
   say, Thou art within the kingdom of heaven, but, "Thou art not far from
   the kingdom of God."

   Bede: But the reason why he was not far from the kingdom of God was,
   that he proved himself to be a favourer of that opinion, which is
   proper to the New Testament and to Gospel perfection.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan, ii, 73: Nor let it trouble us that Matthew
   says, that he who addressed this question to the Lord tempted Him; for
   it may be that though he came as a tempter, yet he was corrected by the
   answer of the Lord. Or at all events, we must not look upon the
   temptation as evil, and done with the intention of deceiving an enemy,
   but rather as the caution of a man who wished to try a thing unknown to
   him.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, he is not far who comes with knowledge; for
   ignorance is farther from the kingdom of God than knowledge; wherefore
   He says above to the Sadducees, "Ye err, not knowing the Scriptures, or
   the power of God."

   It goes on: "And no man after that durst ask Him any questions."

   Bede: For since they were confuted in argument, they ask Him no further
   questions, but take Him without any disguise, and give Him up to the
   Roman power. From which we understand that the venom of envy may be
   overcome, but can hardly lie quiet.
     __________________________________________________________________

   35. And Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, "How
   say the Scribes that Christ is the Son of David?

   36. For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord
   - "Sit thou on My right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."

   37. David therefore himself calleth Him Lord; and whence is He then his
   son?" And the common people heard Him gladly.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: Because Christ was coming to His Passion, He corrects a
   false opinion of the Jews, who said that Christ was the Son of David,
   not his Lord.

   Wherefore it is said, "And Jesus answered and said, while He taught in
   the temple."

   Pseudo-Jerome: That is, He openly speaks to them of Himself, that they
   may be inexcusable.

   For it goes on: "How say the Scribes that Christ is the Son of David?"

   Theophylact: But Christ shews Himself to be the Lord, by the words of
   David.

   For it goes on: "For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord
   said to my Lord, Sit thou on My right hand;" as if He had said, Ye
   cannot say that David said this without the grace of the Holy Spirit,
   but he called Him Lord in the Holy Spirit; and that He is Lord, he
   shews, by this that is added, "Till I make Thine enemies Thy
   footstool;" for they themselves were His enemies, whom God put under
   the footstool of Christ.

   Bede: But the putting down of His enemies by the Father, does not shew
   the weakness of the Son, but the unity of nature, by which One works in
   the Other; for the Son also subjects the Father's enemies, because He
   glorifies His Father upon earth.

   Gloss.: Thus then Lord concludes from what has gone before the doubtful
   questions. For from the foregoing words of David it is proved that
   Christ is the Lord of David, but according to the saying of the
   Scribes, it is proved that He is his Son. And this is what is added,
   "David himself then calls Him Lord, how is He then his Son?"

   Bede: The question of Jesus is useful for us even now against the Jews;
   for they, acknowledging that Christ is to come, assert that He is a
   mere man, a holy Person descended from David. Let us then ask them, as
   our Lord has taught us, if He be a mere man, and only the son of David,
   how David in the Holy Spirit calls Him Lord. They are not however
   reproved for calling Him David's son, but for not believing Him to be
   the Son of God.

   It goes on: "And the common people heard Him gladly."

   Gloss.: Namely, because they saw that He answered and put questions
   wisely.

   38. And He said unto them in His doctrine, "Beware of the scribes,
   which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the
   marketplaces,

   39. And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at
   feasts:

   40. Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers:
   these shall receive greater damnation."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: After confuting the Scribes and Pharisees, He burns up
   as a fire their dry and withered examples.

   Wherefore it is said, "And He said unto them in His doctrine, Beware of
   the Scribes, which love to go in long clothing."

   Bede: To walk in long clothing is to go forth into public clad in
   garments too much ornamented, in which amongst other things, that rich
   man, who fared sumptuously every day, is said to have sinned.

   Theophylact: But they used to walk in honourable garments, because they
   wished to be highly esteemed for it, and in like manner they desired
   other things, which lead to glory.

   For it goes on: "And love salutations in the marketplaces, and the
   chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts."

   Bede: We must observe that He does not forbid that those, to whom it
   falls by the rule of their office, should be saluted in the
   marketplace, or have chief seats and places at feasts, but He teaches
   that those who love those things unduly, whether they have them or no,
   are to be avoided by the faithful as wicked men: that is, He blames the
   intention and not the office; although this too is culpable, that the
   very men who wish to be called masters of the synagogue in Moses' seat,
   should have to do with lawsuits in the marketplace. We are in two way
   ordered to beware of those who are desirous of vain glory; first, we
   should not be seduced by their hypocrisy into thinking that what they
   do is good; nor secondly, should we be excited to imitate them, through
   a vain rejoicing in being praised for those virtues which they affect.

   Theophylact: He also especially teaches the Apostles, not to have any
   communication with the scribes, but to imitate Christ Himself; and in
   ordaining them to be masters in the duties of life, He places others
   under them. [ed. note: Theophylact's words should be translated - He
   becomes their example in the duties of life.]

   Bede: But they do not only seek for praise from men, but also for gain.
   Where there follows, "Which devour widows' houses, under the pretence
   of long prayers." For there are men who pretending to be just hesitate
   not to receive money from persons who are troubled in conscience, as
   though they would be their advocates in the judgment. A hand stretched
   out to the poor is always an accompaniment to prayer, but these men
   pass the night in prayer, that they may take away money from the poor.

   Theophylact: But the Scribes used to come to women, who were left
   without the protection of their husbands, as though they were their
   protectors; and by a pretence of prayer, a reverend exterior and
   hypocrisy, they used to deceive widows, and thus also devour the houses
   of the rich.

   It goes on: "These shall receive a greater damnation," that is, than
   the other Jews, who sinned.
     __________________________________________________________________

   41. And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people
   cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.

   42. And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,
   which make a farthing.

   43. And He called unto Him His disciples, and saith unto them, "Verily
   I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they
   which have cast into the treasury:

   44. For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want
   did cast in all that she had, even all her living."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: The Lord, who had warned them to avoid the desire of high place
   and vain glory, now distinguishes by a sure test those who brought in
   gifts.

   Wherefore it is said, "And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and
   beheld how the people cast money into the treasury."

   In the Greek language, "phylassein", means to keep, and "gaza" is a
   Persian word for treasure; wherefore the word "gazophylacium" which is
   here used means a place where riches are kept, which name also was
   applied to the chest in which the offerings of the people were
   collected, for the necessary uses of the temple, and to the porch in
   which they were kept.

   You have a notice of the porch in the Gospel, "These words spake Jesus
   in the treasury as He taught in the temple:" [John 8:20] and of the
   chest in the book of Kings, "But Jehoiada the priest took a chest." [2
   Kings 12:9]

   Theophylact: Now there was a praiseworthy custom amongst the Jews, that
   those who were able and willing should put something into the treasury,
   for the maintenance of the priests, the poor, and the widows.

   Wherefore there is added, "And many that were rich cast in much."

   But whilst many people were so engaged, a poor widow came up, and
   shewed her love by offering money according to her ability.

   Wherefore it is said, "And there came a certain poor widow, and she
   threw in two mites, which make a farthing."

   Bede: Reckoners use the words "quadrans" for the fourth part of any
   thing, be it place, money, or time. Perhaps then in this place is meant
   the fourth part of a shekel, this is, five pence.

   It goes on: "And He called unto Him His disciples, and saith unto them,
   Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all
   they which have cast into the treasury:" for God does not weigh the
   property but the conscience of those who offer; nor did He consider the
   smallness of the sum in her offering, but what was the store from which
   it came.

   Wherefore He adds, "For all they did cast in of their abundance, but
   she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living."

   Pseudo-Jerome: But in a mystical sense, they are rich, who bring forth
   from the treasure of their heart things new and old, which are the
   obscure and hidden things of Divine wisdom in both testaments; but who
   is the poor woman, if it be not I and those like me, who cast in what I
   can, and have the will to explain to you, where I have, not the power.
   For God does not consider how much ye bear, but what is the store from
   which it comes; but each at all events can bring his farthing, that is,
   a ready will, which is called a farthing, because it is accompanied by
   three things, that is, thought, word and deed. And in that it is said
   that "she cast in all her living," it is implied that all that the body
   wants is that by which it lives. Wherefore it is said, "All the labour
   of man is for his mouth." [Eccl 6:7]

   Theophylact: Or else; that widow is the soul of man, which leaving
   Satan to which it had been joined, casts into the temple two mites,
   that is, the flesh and the mind, the flesh by abstinence, the mind by
   humility, that so it may be able to hear that it has cast away all its
   living, and has consecrated it, leaving nothing for the world of all
   that it possessed.

   Bede: Again, in an allegorical way, the rich men, who cast gifts into
   the treasury, point out the Jews puffed up with the righteousness of
   the law; the poor widow is the simplicity of the Church: poor indeed,
   because she has cast away the spirit of pride and of the desires of
   worldly things; and a widow, because Jesus her husband has suffered
   death for her. She casts two mites into the treasury, because she
   brings the love of God and of her neighbour, or the gifts of faith and
   prayer; which are looked upon as mites in their own insignificance, but
   measured by the merit of a devout intention are superior to all the
   proud works of the Jews. The Jew sends of his abundance into the
   treasury, because he presumes on his own righteousness; but the Church
   sends her whole living into God's treasury, because she understands
   that even her very living is not of her own desert, but of Divine
   grace.

Chapter 13

   1. And as He went out of the temple, one of His disciples saith unto
   Him, "Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!"

   2. And Jesus answering said unto him, "Seest thou these great
   buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall
   not be thrown down."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, in Marc., iv, 42: Because after the founding of the Church of
   Christ, Judaea was to be punished for her treachery, the Lord fitly,
   after praising the devotedness of the Church in the person of the poor
   widow, goes out of the temple, and foretold its coming ruin, and the
   contempt in which the buildings now so wonderful were soon to be held.

   Wherefore it is said, "And as He went out of the temple, one of His
   disciples saith unto Him, Master, see what manner of stones and what
   buildings are here!"

   Theophylact: For, since the Lord had spoken much concerning the
   destruction of Jerusalem, His disciples wondered, that such numerous
   and beautiful buildings were to be destroyed; and this is the reason
   why they point out the beauty of the temple, and He answers not only
   that they were to be destroyed, but also that one stone should not be
   left upon another.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou
   these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another,
   that shall not be thrown down."

   Now some may endeavour to prove that Christ's words were false, by
   saying that many ruins were left, but this is not at all the point; for
   though some ruins had been left, still at the consummation of all
   things one stone shall not be left upon another. Besides it is related,
   that Aelius Adrian overturned the city and the temple from the
   foundation, so that the word of the Lord here spoken was fulfilled.

   Bede: But it was ordered by Divine power that after that the grace of
   the faith of the Gospel was made known through the world, the temple
   itself with its ceremonies should be taken away; lest perchance some
   one weak in the faith, if he saw that these things which had been
   instituted by God still remained, might by degrees drop from the
   sincerity of the faith, which is in Christ Jesus, into carnal Judaism.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Here also the Lord enumerates to His disciples the
   destruction of the last time, that is of the temple, with the people,
   and its letter; of which one stone shall not be left upon another, that
   is, no testimony of the Prophets upon those, to whom the Jews
   perversely applied them, that is, on Ezra, Zerubbabel and the
   Maccabees.

   Bede: Again, when the Lord left the temple, all the edifice of the law
   and the framework of the commandments were destroyed, so that nothing
   could be filled up by the Jews; and now that the head has been taken
   away, all the limbs fight one against the other.
     __________________________________________________________________

   3. And as He sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,
   Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,

   4. "Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign
   when all these things shall be fulfilled?"

   5. And Jesus answering them began to say, "Take heed lest any man
   deceive you:

   6. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ;' and shall
   deceive many.

   7. And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
   troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.

   8. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
   and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be
   famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: Because the Lord, when some were praising the buildings of the
   temple, had plainly answered that all these were to be destroyed, the
   disciples privately enquired about the time and the signs of the
   destruction which was foretold.

   Wherefore it is said: "And as He sat upon the mount of Olives, over
   against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him
   privately, Tell us when shall these things be? and what shall be the
   sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?"

   The Lord sits upon the mount of Olives, over against the temple, when
   He discourses upon the ruin and destruction of the temple, so that even
   His bodily position may be in accordance with the words which He
   speaks, pointing out mystically that, abiding in peace with the saints,
   He hates the madness of the proud. For the mount of Olives marks the
   fruitful sublimity of the Holy Church.

   Augustine, Epist., cxcix, 9: In answer to the disciples, the Lord tells
   them of things which were from that time forth to have their course;
   whether He meant the destruction of Jerusalem which occasioned their
   question, or His own coming through the Church, (in which He ever comes
   even unto the end, for we know that He comes in His own, when His
   members are born day by day,) or the end itself, in which He will
   appear to judge the quick and the dead.

   Theophylact: But before answering their question, He strengthens their
   minds that they may not be deceived.

   Wherefore there follows: "And Jesus answering them began to say, Take
   heed lest any man deceive you?"

   And this He says, because when the sufferings of the Jews began, some
   arose professing to be teachers.

   Wherefore there follows: "For many shall come in My name, saying, I am
   Christ; and shall deceive many."

   Bede: For many came forward, when destruction was hanging over
   Jerusalem, saying that they were Christs, and that the time of freedom
   was now approaching. Many teachers of heresy also arose in the Church
   even in the time of the Apostles; and many Antichrists came in the name
   of Christ, the first of whom was Simon Magus, to whom the Samaritans,
   as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, listened, saying, "This man is
   the great power of God." [Acts 8:10]

   Wherefore also it is added here, "And shall deceive many."

   Now from the time of the Passion of our Lord there ceased not amongst
   the Jewish people, who chose the seditious robber and rejected Christ
   the Saviour, either external wars or civil discord.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of
   wars, be ye not troubled."

   And when these come, the Apostles are warned not to be afraid, or to
   leave Jerusalem and Judaea, because the end was not to come at once,
   nay was to be put off for forty years.

   And this is what is added: "for such things must needs be; but the end
   shall not be yet," that is, the desolation of the province, and the
   last destruction of the city and temple.

   It goes on: "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
   kingdom."

   Theophylact: That is, the Romans against the Jews, which Josephus
   relates happened before the destruction of Jerusalem. For when the Jews
   refused to pay tribute, the Romans arose, in anger; but because at that
   time they were merciful, they took indeed their spoils, but did not
   destroy Jerusalem. What follows shews that God fought against the Jews,
   for it is said, "And there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and
   there shall be famines."

   Bede: Now it is on record that this literally took place at the time of
   the Jewish rebellion. But "kingdom against kingdom," the pestilence of
   those whose word spreads as a canker, dearth of the word of God, the
   commotion of the whole earth, and the separation from the true faith,
   may all rather be understood of heretics who, by fighting one against
   the other, bring about the triumph of the Church.

   9. "But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
   councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be
   brought before rulers and kings for My sake, for a testimony against
   them.

   10. And the Gospel must first be published among all nations.

   11. But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought
   beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but
   whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is
   not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.

   12. Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father
   the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall
   cause them to be put to death.

   13. And ye shall be hated of all men for My name's sake: but he that
   shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: The Lords shews how Jerusalem and the province of Judaea merited
   the infliction of such calamities, in the following words: "But take
   heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in
   the synagogues ye shall be beaten."

   For the greatest cause of destruction to the Jewish people was, that
   after slaying the Saviour, they also tormented the heralds of His name
   and faith with wicked cruelty.

   Theophylact: Fitly also did He premise a recital of those things which
   concerned the Apostles, that in their own tribulations they might find
   some consolation in the community of troubles and sufferings.

   There follows: "And ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for My
   sake, for a testimony against them."

   He says "kings and rulers," as, for instance, Agrippa, Nero and Herod.
   Again, His saying, "for My sake," gave them no small consolation, in
   that they were about to suffer for His sake. "For a testimony against
   them," means, as a judgment beforehand against them, that they might be
   inexcusable, in that though the Apostles were labouring for the truth,
   they would not join themselves to it. Then, that they might not think
   that their preaching should be impeded by troubles and dangers, He
   adds: "And the Gospel must first be published among all nations."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 77: Matthew adds, "And then shall the end
   come." [Matt 24:14]

   Bede: Ecclesiastical historians testify that this was fulfilled, for
   they relate that all the Apostles long before the destruction of the
   province of Judaea were dispersed to preach the Gospel over the whole
   world, except James the son of Zebedee and James the brother of our
   Lord, who had before shed their blood in Judaea for the word of the
   Lord. Since then the Lord knew that the hearts of the disciples would
   be saddened by the fall and destruction of their nation, He relieves
   them by this consolation, to let them know that even after the casting
   away of the Jews, companions in their joy and heavenly kingdom should
   not be wanting, nay that many more were to be collected out of all
   mankind than perished in Judaea.

   Gloss.: Another anxiety might also arise in the breasts of the
   disciples. Lest therefore after hearing that they were to be brought
   before kings and rulers, they should fear that their want of science
   and eloquence should render them unable to answer, our Lord consoles
   them by saying, "But when they shall lead you and deliver you up, take
   no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, but whatsoever shall be
   given you in that hour, that speak ye."

   Bede: For when we are led before judges for Christ's sake, all our duty
   is to offer up our will for Christ. As for the rest, Christ Himself who
   dwells in us speaks for us, and the grace of the Holy Ghost shall be
   given us, when we answer.

   Wherefore it goes on: "For it is not ye that shall speak, but the Holy
   Ghost."

   Theophylact: He also foretells to them a worse evil, that they should
   suffer persecution from their relations.

   Wherefore there follows: "Now the brother shall betray the brother to
   death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their
   parents, and shall cause them to be put to death; and ye shall be hated
   of all men for My name's sake."

   Bede: This has often been seen in time of persecution, nor can there be
   any firm affection amongst men who differ in faith.

   Theophylact: And this He says, that on hearing it, they might prepare
   themselves to bear persecutions and ills with greater patience. Then He
   brings them consolation, saying, "And ye shall be hated of all men for
   My name's sake;" for the being hated for Christ's sake is a sufficient
   reason for suffering persecutions patiently, for it is not the
   punishment, but the cause, that makes the martyr. Again, that which
   follows is no small comfort amidst persecution: "But he that shall
   endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."
     __________________________________________________________________

   14. "But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by
   Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth
   understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:

   15. And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house,
   neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:

   16. And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up
   his garment.

   17. But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in
   those days!

   18. And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.

   19. For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
   beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither
   shall be.

   20. And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should
   be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom He hath chosen, He hath
   shortened the days."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss.: After speaking of the things which were to happen before the
   destruction of the city, the Lord now foretells those which happened
   about the destruction itself of the city, saying, "But when ye shall
   see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not, (let him
   that readeth understand)."

   Augustine, de Con Evan, ii, 77: Matthew says, standing "in the holy
   place;" but with this verbal difference Mark has expressed the same
   meaning; for He says "where it ought not" to stand, because it ought
   not to stand in the holy place.

   Bede: When we are challenged to understand what is said, we may
   conclude that it is mystical. But it may either be said simply of
   Antichrist, or of the statue of Caesar, which Pilate put into the
   temple, or of the equestrian statue of Adrian, which for a long time
   stood in the holy of holies itself. An idol is also called abomination
   according to the Old Testament, and He has added "of desolation"
   because it was placed in the temple when desolate and deserted.

   Theophylact: Or He means by "the abomination of desolation" the
   entrance of enemies into the city by violence.

   Augustine, Epist., cxcix, 9: But Luke, in order to shew that the
   abomination of desolation happened when Jerusalem was taken, in this
   same place gives the words of our Lord, "And when ye shall see
   Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof
   is nigh." [Luke 21:20]

   It goes on: "Then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains."

   Bede: It is on record that this was literally fulfilled, when on the
   approach of the war with Rome and the extermination of the Jewish
   people, all the Christians who were in that province, warned by the
   prophecy, fled far away, as Church history relates, and retiring beyond
   Jordan, remained for a time in the city of Pella under the protection
   of Agrippa, the king of the Jews, to whom mention is made in the Acts,
   and who with that part of the Jews, who chose to obey him, always
   continued subject to the Roman empire.

   Theophylact: And well does He say, "Who are in Judaea," for the
   Apostles were no longer in Judaea, but before the battle had been
   driven from Jerusalem.

   Gloss.: [ed. note: Non in Gloss - sed ap. Theophylact] Or rather went
   out of their own accord, being led by the Holy Ghost.

   It goes on: "And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the
   house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house;" for
   it is a desirable thing to be saved even naked from such a destruction.

   It goes on: "But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give
   suck in those days."

   Bede: That is, they whose wombs or whose hands, overladen with the
   burden of children, in no small measure impede their forced flight.

   Theophylact: But it seems to me, that in these words He foretells the
   eating of children, for when afflicted by famine and pestilence, they
   laid hands on their children.

   Gloss.: Again, after having mentioned this double impediment to flight,
   which might arise either from the desire of taking away property, or
   from having children to carry, He touches upon the third obstacle,
   namely, that coming from the season; saying, "And pray ye that your
   flight be not in the winter."

   Theophylact: That is, lest they who wish to fly should be impeded by
   the difficulties of the season. And He fitly gives the cause for so
   great a necessity for flight; saying, "For in those days shall be
   affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which
   God created unto this time, neither shall be."

   Augustine, Epist., cxcix, 9: For Josephus, who has written the history
   of the Jews, relates that such things were suffered by this people, as
   are scarcely credible, wherefore it is said, not without cause, that
   there was not such tribulation from the beginning of the creation until
   now, nor shall ever be. But although in the time of Antichrist there
   shall be one similar or greater, we must understand that it is of that
   people, that it is said that there shall never happen such another. For
   if they are the first and foremost to receive Antichrist, that same
   people may rather be said to cause than to suffer tribulation.

   Bede: The only refuge in such evils is, that God who gives strength to
   suffer, should abridge the power of inflicting.

   Wherefore there follows: "And except that the Lord had shortened those
   days."

   Theophylact: That is, if the Roman war had not been soon finished, "no
   flesh should be saved;" that is, no Jew should have escaped; "but for
   the elect's sake, whom He hath chosen," that is, for the sake of the
   believing Jews, or who were hereafter to believe, "He hath shortened
   the days," that is, the war was soon finished, for God foresaw that
   many Jews would believe after the destruction of the city; for which
   reason He would not suffer the whole race to be utterly destroyed.

   Augustine: But some persons more fitly understand that the calamities
   themselves are signified by days, as evil days are spoken of in other
   parts of Holy Scripture; for the days themselves are not evil, but what
   is done in them. The woes themselves therefore are said to be abridged,
   because through the patience which God gave they felt them less, and
   then what was great in itself was abridged.

   Bede: Or else; these words, "In those days shall be affliction,"
   properly agree with the times of Antichrist, when not only tortures
   more frequent, and more painful than before are to be heaped on the
   faithful, but also, what is more terrible, the working of miracles
   shall accompany those who inflict torments. But in proportion as this
   tribulation shall be greater than those which preceded, by so much
   shall it be shorter.

   For it is believed, that during three years and a half, as far as may
   be conjectured from the prophecy of Daniel and the Revelations of John,
   the Church is to be attacked. In a spiritual sense, however, when we
   see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not, that is,
   heresies and crimes reigning amongst them, who appear to be consecrated
   by the heavenly mysteries, then whosoever of us remain in Judaea, that
   is, in the confession of the true faith, ought to mount the higher in
   virtue, the more men we see following the broad paths of vice.

   Pseudo-Jerome: For our flight is to the mountains, that he who has
   mounted to the heights of virtue may not go down to the depths of sin.

   Bede: Then let him who is on the house-top, that is, whose mind rises
   above carnal deeds, and who lives spiritually, as it were in the free
   air, not come down to the base acts of his former conversation, nor
   seek again those things which he had left, the desires of the world or
   the flesh. For our house either means this world, or that in which we
   live, our own flesh.

   Pseudo-Jerome: "Pray that your flight may not be in the winter, or on
   the sabbath day," that is, that the fruit of our work may not be ended
   with the end of time; for fruit comes to an end in the winter and time
   in the sabbath.

   Bede: But if we are to understand it of the consummation of the world,
   He commands that our faith and love for Christ should not grow cold,
   and that we should not grow lazy and cold in the work of God, by taking
   a sabbath from virtue.

   Theophylact: We must also avoid sin with fervour, and not coldly and
   quietly.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But the tribulation shall be great, and the days short,
   for the sake of the elect, lest the evil of this time should change
   their understanding.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: After that the Lord had finished all that concerned
   Jerusalem, He now speaks of the coming of Antichrist, saying, "Then if
   any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, to, he is there;
   believe him not." But when He says, "then," think not that it means
   immediately after these things are fulfilled about Jerusalem; as
   Matthew also says after the birth of Christ, "In those days came John
   the Baptist;" [Matt 3:1] does he mean immediately after the birth of
   Christ? No, but he speaks indefinitely and without precision. So also
   here, "then" may be taken to mean not when Jerusalem shall be made
   desolate, but about the time of the coming of Antichrist.

   It goes on: "For false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and
   shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the
   elect."

   For many shall take upon them the name of Christ, so as to seduce even
   the faithful.

   Augustine, de Civ. Dei, xx, 19: For then shall Satan be unchained, and
   work through Antichrist in all his power, wonderfully indeed, but
   falsely. But a doubt is often raised whether the Apostle said "signs
   and lying wonders," because he is to deceive mortal sense, by phantoms,
   so as to appear to do what he does not, or because those wonders
   themselves, even though true, are to turn men aside to lies, because
   they will not believe that any power but a Divine power could do them,
   being ignorant of the power of Satan, especially when he shall have
   received such power as he never had before. But for whichever reason it
   is said, they shall be deceived by those signs and wonders who deserve
   to be deceived.

   Greg., Hom in Ezech. i, 9: Why however is it said with a doubt "if it
   were possible," when the Lord knows beforehand what is to be? One of
   two things is implied; that if they are elect, it is not possible; and
   if it is possible, they are not elect. This doubt therefore in our
   Lord's discourse expresses the trembling in the mind of the elect. And
   He calls them elect, because He sees that they will persevere in faith
   and good works; for those who are chosen to remain firm are to be
   tempted to fall by the signs of the preachers of Antichrist.

   Bede: Some however refer this to the time of the Jewish captivity,
   where many, declaring themselves to be Christs, drew after them crowds
   of deluded persons; but during the siege of the city there was no
   Christian to whom the Divine exhortation, not to follow false teachers,
   could apply. Wherefore it is better to understand it of heretics, who,
   coming to oppose the Church, pretended to be Christs; the first of whom
   was Simon Magus, but that last one, greater than the rest, is
   Antichrist.

   It goes on: "But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things."

   Augustine, Epist., 78: For He did not only foretel to His disciples the
   good things which He would give to His saints and faithful ones, but
   also the woes in which this world was to abound, that we might look for
   our reward at the end of the world with more confidence, from feeling
   the woes in like manner announced as about to precede the end of the
   world.

   Theophylact: But after the coming of Antichrist, the frame of the world
   shall be altered and changed, for the stars shall be obscured on
   account of the abundance of the brightness of Christ.

   Wherefore it goes on: "But in those days, after that tribulation, the
   sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light; and the
   stars of heaven shall fall."

   Bede: For the stars in the day of judgment shall appear obscure, not by
   any lessening of their own light, but because of the brightness of the
   true light, that is, of the most high Judge coming upon them; although
   there is nothing to prevent its being taken to mean, that the sun and
   moon with all the other heavenly bodies then for a time are really to
   lose their light, just as we are told was the case with the sun at the
   time of our Lord's Passion. But after the day of judgment, when there
   shall be a new sky and a new earth, then shall happen what Isaiah says:
   "Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and
   the light of the sun shall be sevenfold." [Isa 30:26]

   There follows: "And the powers of heaven shall be shaken."

   Theophylact: That is, the Angelic virtues shall be astonished, seeing
   that such great things are done, and that their fellow-servants are
   judged.

   Bede: What wonder is it that men should be troubled at this judgment,
   the sight of which makes the very Angelic powers to tremble? What will
   the stories of the house do when the pillars shake? What does the shrub
   of the wilderness undergo, when the cedar of paradise is moved?

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, the sun shall be darkened, at the coldness of
   their hearts, as in the winter time. And the moon shall not give her
   light with serenity, in this time of quarrel, and the stars of heaven
   shall fail in their light, when the seed of Abraham shall all but
   disappear, for to it they are likened [Gen 22:17]. And the powers of
   heaven shall be stirred up to the wrath of vengeance, when they shall
   be sent by the Son of Man at His coming, of whose Advent it is said,
   "And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great
   power and glory," He, that is, who first came down like rain into the
   fleece of Gideon in all lowliness.

   Augustine, Epist., cxcix, 11: For since it was said by the Angels to
   the Apostles, "He shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go
   into heaven," [Acts 1:11] rightly do we believe that He will come not
   only in the same body, but on a cloud, since He is to come as He went
   away, and a cloud received Him as He was going.

   Theophylact: But they shall see the Lord as the Son of Man, that is, in
   the body, for that which is seen is body.

   Augustine, de Trin., i, 13: For the vision of the Son of Man is shewn
   even to the bad, but the vision of the form of God to the pure in heart
   alone, "for they shall see God." [Matt 5:8] And because the wicked
   cannot see the Son of God, as He is in the form of God, equal to the
   Father, and at the same time both just and wicked are to see Him as
   Judge of the quick and dead, before Whom they shall be judged, it was
   necessary that the Son of Man should receive power to judge. Concerning
   the execution of which power, there is immediately added, "And then
   shall He send He angels."

   Theophylact: Observe that Christ sends the Angels as well as the
   Father; where then are they who say that He is not equal to the Father?
   For the Angels go forth to gather together the faithful, who are
   chosen, that they may be carried into the air to meet Jesus Christ.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And gather together His elect from the four
   winds."

   Pseudo-Jerome: As corn winnowed from the threshing-floor of the whole
   earth.

   Bede: By "the four winds," He means the four parts of the world, the
   east, the west, the north, and the south. And lest any one should think
   that the elect are to be gathered together only from the four edges of
   the world, and not from the midland regions as well as the borders, He
   has fitly added, "From the uttermost part of earth, to the uttermost
   part of heaven," that is, from the extremities of the earth to its
   utmost bounds, where the circle of the heavens appears to those who
   look from afar to rest upon the boundaries of the earth. No one
   therefore shall be elect in that day who remains behind and does not
   meet the Lord in the air, when He comes to judgment. The reprobate also
   shall come to judgment, that when it is finished they may be scattered
   abroad and perish from before the face of God.

   28. "Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
   tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:

   29. So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass,
   know that it is nigh, even at the doors.

   30. Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till
   all these things be done.

   31. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but My words shall not pass
   away."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: Under the example of a tree the Lord gave a pattern of the end,
   saying, "Now learn a parable of the fig tree, when her branch is yet
   tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near. So ye in
   like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it
   is nigh, even at the doors."

   Theophylact: As if He had said, As when the fig tree puts forth its
   leaves, summer follows at once, so also after the woes of Antichrist,
   at once, without an interval, shall be the coming of Christ, who will
   be to the just as summer after winter, but to sinners, winter after
   summer.

   Augustine, Epist., 119, 11: All that is said by the three Evangelists
   concerning the Advent of our Lord, if diligently compared together and
   examined, will perchance be found to belong to His daily coming in His
   body, that is, the Church, except those places where that last coming
   is so promised, as if it were approaching; for instance in the last
   part of the discourse according to Matthew, the coming itself is
   clearly expressed, where it is said, "When the Son of Man shall come in
   His glory," [Matt 25:31] For what does He refer to in the words, "when
   ye shall see these things come to pass," but those things which He has
   mentioned above, amongst which it is said, "And then ye shall see the
   Son of Man coming in the clouds." The end therefore shall not be then,
   but then it shall be near at hand.

   Or are we to say, that not all those things which are mentioned above
   are to be taken in, but only some of them, that is, leaving out these
   words, "Then shall ye see the Son of Man coming;" for that shall be the
   end itself, and not its approach only. But Matthew has declared that it
   is to be received without exception, saying, "When ye shall see all
   these things, know that it is near, even at the doors." That which is
   said above must therefore be taken thus; "And He shall send His angels,
   and gather together the elect from the four winds;" that is, He shall
   collect His elect from the four winds of heaven, which He does in the
   whole of the last hour, coming in His members as in clouds.

   Bede: This fruitbearing of the fig tree may also be understood to mean
   the state of the synagogue, which was condemned to everlasting
   barrenness, because when the Lord came, it had no fruits of
   righteousness in those who were then unfaithful. But the Apostle has
   said that when the fulness of the Gentiles is come in [Rom 11:25], all
   Israel shall be saved. What means this, but that the tree, which has
   been long barren, shall then yield the fruit, which it had withheld?
   When this shall happen, doubt not that a summer of true peace is at
   hand.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, the leaves which come forth are words now
   spoken, the summer at hand is the day of Judgment, in which every tree
   shall shew what it had within it, deadness for burning, or greenness to
   be planted with the tree of life.

   There follows: "Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass,
   till these things be done."

   Bede: By generation He either means the whole race of mankind, or
   specially the Jews.

   Theophylact: Or else, "This generation shall not pass away," that is,
   the generation of Christians, "until all things be fulfilled," which
   were spoken concerning Jerusalem and the coming of Antichrist; for He
   does not mean the generation of the Apostles, for the greater part of
   the Apostles did not live up to the destruction of Jerusalem. But He
   says this of the generation of Christians, wishing to console His
   disciples, lest they should believe that the faith should fail at that
   time; for the immoveable elements shall first fail, before the words of
   Christ fail; wherefore it is added, "Heaven and earth shall pass away,
   but My words shall not pass away."

   Bede: The heaven which shall pass away is not the ethereal or starry
   heaven, but the heaven where is the air. For wheresoever the water of
   the judgment could reach, there also, according to the words of the
   blessed Peter, the fire of judgment shall reach [2 Pet 3:10-12]. But
   the heaven and the earth shall pass away in that form which they now
   have, but in their essence they shall last without end.

   32. "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels
   which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

   33. Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is.

   34. For the Son of Man is a man taking a far journey, who left his
   house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work,
   and commanded the porter to watch.

   35. Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house
   cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the
   morning:

   36. Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

   37. And what I say unto you I say unto all - Watch."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: The Lord wishing to prevent His disciples from asking
   about that day and hour, says, "But of that day and that hour knoweth
   no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but
   the Father."

   For if He had said, I know, but I will not reveal it to you, He would
   have saddened them not a little; but He acted more wisely, and prevents
   their asking such a question, lest they should importune Him, by
   saying, neither the Angels, nor I.

   Hilary, de Trin., ix: This ignorance of the day and hour is urged
   against the Only-Begotten God, as if, God born of God had not the same
   perfection of nature as God. But first, let common sense decide whether
   it is credible that He, who is the cause that all things are, and are
   to be, should be ignorant of any out of all these things. For how can
   it be beyond the knowledge of that nature, by which and in which that
   which is to be done is contained? And can He be ignorant of that day,
   which is the day of His own Advent? Human substances foreknow as far as
   they can what they intend to do, and the knowledge of what is to be
   done, follows upon the will to act. How then can the Lord of glory,
   from ignorance of the day of His coming, be believed to be of that
   imperfect nature, which has on it a necessity of coming, and has not
   attained to the knowledge of its own advent?

   But again, how much more room for blasphemy will there be, if a feeling
   of envy is ascribed to God the Father, in that He has withheld the
   knowledge of His beatitude from Him to whom He gave a foreknowledge of
   His death. But if there are in Him all the treasures of knowledge, He
   is not ignorant of this day; rather we ought to remember that the
   treasures of wisdom in Him are hidden; His ignorance therefore must be
   connected with the hiding of the treasures of wisdom, which are in Him.

   For in all cases, in which God declares Himself ignorant, He is not
   under the power of ignorance, but either it is not a fit time for
   speaking, or it is an economy of not acting.

   But if God is said then to have known that Abraham loved Him, when He
   did not hide that His knowledge from Abraham, it follows, that the
   Father is said to know the day, because He did not hide it from the
   Son. If therefore the Son knew not the day, it is a Sacrament of His
   being silent, as on the contrary the Father alone is said to know,
   because He is not silent. But God forbid that any new and bodily
   changes should be ascribed to the Father or the Son.

   Lastly, lest He should be said to be ignorant from weakness, He has
   immediately added, "Take ye heed, watch and pray, for ye know not when
   the time is."

   Pseudo-Jerome: For we must needs watch with our souls before the death
   of the body.

   Theophylact: But He teach us two things, watching and prayer; for many
   of us watch, but watch only to pass the night in wickedness; He now
   follows this up with a parable, saying, "For the Son of Man is as a man
   taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave his servants power
   over every work, and commanded the porter to watch."

   Bede: The man who taking a far journey left his house is Christ, who
   ascending as a conqueror to His Father after the Resurrection, left His
   Church, as to His bodily presence, but has never deprived her of the
   safeguard of His Divine presence.

   Greg, Hom in Evan, 9: For the earth is properly the place for the
   flesh, which was as it were carried away to a far country, when it was
   placed by our Redeemer in the heavens. "And he gave his servants power
   over every work," when, by giving to His faithful ones the grace of the
   Holy Ghost, He gave them the power of serving every good work.

   He has also ordered the porter to watch, because He commanded the order
   of pastors to have a care over the Church committed to them. Not only,
   however, those of us who rule over Churches, but all are required to
   watch the doors of their hearts, lest the evil suggestions of the devil
   enter into them, and lest our Lord find us sleeping.

   Wherefore concluding this parable He adds, "Watch ye therefore: for ye
   know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight,
   or at cockcrow, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly he find you
   sleeping."

   Pseudo-Jerome: For he who sleeps applies not his mind to real bodies,
   but to phantoms, and when he awakes, he possesses not what he had seen;
   so also are those, whom the love of this world seizes upon in this
   life; they quit after this life what they dreamed was real.

   Theophylact: See again that He has not said, I know not when the time
   will be, but, "Ye know not." For the reason why He concealed it was
   that it was better for us; for if, now that we know not the end, we are
   careless, what should we do if we knew it? We should keep on our
   wickedness even unto the end. Let us therefore attend to His words; for
   the end comes at even, when a man dies in old age; a midnight, when he
   dies in the midst of his youth; and at cockcrow, when our reason is
   perfect within us; for when a child begins to live according to his
   reason, then the cock cries loud within him, rousing him from the sleep
   of sense; but the age of childhood is the morning. Now all these ages
   must look out for the end; for even a child must be watched, lest he
   die unbaptized.

   Pseudo-Jerome: He thus concludes His discourse, that the last should
   hear from those who come first this precept which is common to all;
   wherefore He adds, "But what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch."

   Augustine, Epist., 199, 3: For He not only speaks to those in whose
   hearing He then spake, but even to all who came after them, before our
   time, and even to us, and to all after us, even to His last coming. but
   shall that day find all living, or will any man say that He speaks also
   to the dead, when He says, "Watch, lest when he cometh he find you
   sleeping?"

   Why then does He say to all, what only belongs to those who shall then
   be alive, if it be not that it belongs to all, as I have said? For that
   day comes to each man when his day comes for departing from this life
   such as he is to be, when judged in that day, and for this reason every
   Christian ought to watch, lest the Advent of the Lord find him
   unprepared; but that day shall find him unprepared, whom the last day
   of his life shall find unprepared.

Chapter 14

   1. After two days was the feast of the Passover, and of unleavened
   bread: and the Chief Priests and the Scribes sought how they might take
   Him by craft, and put Him to death.

   2. But they said, "Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the
   people."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: Let us now sprinkle our book, and our thresholds, with
   blood, and put the scarlet thread around the house of our prayers, and
   bind scarlet on our hand, as was done to Zarah [Gen 38:30], that we may
   be able to say that the red heifer [Num 19:2] is slain in the valley
   [Deut 21:4]. For the Evangelist, being about to speak of the slaying of
   Christ, premises, "After two days was the feast of the Passover, and of
   unleavened bread."

   Bede, Marc., iv, 43: Pascha, which in Hebrew is, phase, is not called
   from Passion, as many think, but from passing over, because the
   destroyer, seeing the blood on the doors of the Israelites, passed by
   them, and did not smite them; or the Lord Himself, bringing aid unto
   His people, walked above them.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, phrase, is interpreted as a passing over, but
   Pascha means sacrifice. In the sacrifice of the lamb, and the passing
   of the people through the sea, or through Egypt, the Passion of Christ
   is prefigured, and the redemption of the people from hell, when He
   visits us after two days, that is, when the moon is most full, and the
   age of Christ is perfect, that when no part at all of it is dark, we
   may eat the flesh of the Lamb without spot, Who taketh away the sins of
   the world, in one house, that is, in the Catholic Church, shod with
   charity, and armed with virtue.

   Bede: The difference according to the Old Testament between the
   Passover and the feast of unleavened bread was, that the day alone on
   which the lamb was slain in the evening, that is, the fourteenth moon
   of the first month, was called Passover. But on the fifteenth moon,
   when they came out of Egypt, the feast of unleavened bread came on,
   which solemn time was appointed for seven days, that is, up to the
   twenty-first day of the same month in the evening. But the Evangelists
   indifferently use the day of unleavened bread for the Passover, and the
   Passover for the days of unleavened bread. Wherefore Mark also here
   says, "After two days was the feast of the Passover, and of unleavened
   bread," because the day of the Passover was also ordered to be
   celebrated on the days of unleavened bread, and we also, as it were,
   keeping a continual passover, ought always to be passing out of this
   world.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But iniquity came forth in Babylon from the princes, who
   ought to have purified the temple and the vessels, and themselves
   according to the law, in order to eat the lamb.

   Wherefore there follows: "And the Chief Priests and the Scribes sought
   how they might take Him by craft, and put him to death."

   Now when the head is slain, the whole body is rendered powerless,
   wherefore these wretched men slay the Head. But they avoid the feast
   day, which indeed befits them, for what feasting can there be for them,
   who have lost life and mercy?

   Wherefore it goes on: "But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there
   be an uproar of the people."

   Bede: Not indeed, as the words seem to imply, that they feared the
   uproar, but they were afraid lest He should be taken out of their hands
   by the aid of the people.

   Theophylact: Nevertheless, Christ Himself had determined for Himself
   the day of His Passion; for He wished to be crucified on the Passover,
   because He was the true Passover.

   3. And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at
   meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of
   spikenard very ; and she brake the box, and poured it on His head.

   4. And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and
   said, "Why was this waste of the ointment made?"

   5. "For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and
   have been given to the poor." And they murmured against her.

   6. And Jesus said, "Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought
   a good work on me."

   7. "For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may
   do them good: but Me ye have not always."

   8. "She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint My
   Body to the burying."

   9. "Verily I say unto, wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached
   throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be
   spoken of for a memorial to her."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: The Lord when about to suffer for the whole world, and to redeem
   all nations with His Blood, dwells in Bethany, that is, in the house of
   obedience.

   Wherefore it is said, "And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the
   leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman."

   Pseudo-Jerome: For the fawn amongst the stags ever comes back to his
   couch, that is, the Son, obedient to the Father even unto death, seeks
   for obedience from us.

   Bede: He says "of Simon the leper", not because he remained still a
   leper at that time, but because having once been such, he was healed by
   Our Saviour; his former name is left, that the virtue of the Healer may
   be made manifest.

   Theophylact: But although the four Evangelists record the anointing by
   a woman, there were two women and not one; one described by John, the
   sister of Lazarus; it was she who six days before the Passover anointed
   the feet of Jesus; another described by the other three Evangelists.
   Nay, if you examine, you will find three; for one is described by John,
   another by Luke, a third by the other two. For that one described by
   Luke is said to be a sinner and to have come to Jesus during the time
   of His preaching; but this other described by Matthew and Mark is said
   to have come at the time of the Passion, nor did she confess that she
   had been a sinner.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., ii, 79: I however think that nothing else can
   be meant, but that the sinner who then came to the feet of Jesus was
   none other than the same Mary who did this twice; once, as Luke relates
   it, when coming for the first time with humility and tears she merited
   the remission of her sins. For John also relates this, when he began to
   speak of the raising of Lazarus before He came to Bethany, saying, "It
   was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet
   with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick." [John 11:2]

   But what she again did at Bethany is another act, unrecorded by Luke,
   but mentioned in the same way by the other three Evangelists. In that
   therefore Matthew and Mark say that the head of the Lord was anointed
   by the woman, whilst John says the feet, we must understand that both
   the head and the feet were anointed by the woman. Unless because Mark
   has said that she broke the box in order to anoint His head, any one is
   so fond of cavilling as to deny that, because the box was broken, any
   could remain to anoint the feet of the Lord. But a man of a more pious
   spirit will contend that it was not broken so as to pour out the whole,
   or else that the feet were anointed before it was broken, so that there
   remained in the unbroken box enough to anoint the head.

   Bede: Alabaster is a sort of white marble, veined with various colors
   which is often hollowed out for boxes of ointment, because it keeps
   things of that nature most uncorrupt. Nard is an aromatic shrub of a
   large and thick root, but short, black and brittle; though unctuous, it
   smells like cypress, and has a sharp taste, and small and dense leaves.
   Its tops spread themselves out like ears of corn, therefore, its gift
   being double, perfumers make much of the spikes and the leaves of the
   nard. And this is what is meant by Mark, when he says "spikenard very
   precious", that is, the ointment which Mary brought for the Lord was
   not made of the root of nard, but even, what made it more precious, by
   the addition of the spikes and the leaves, the gratefulness of its
   smell and virtue was augmented.

   Theophylact, Matthew 26:2 : Or as is said in Greek, of pistic nard,
   that is, faithful, because the ointment of the nard was made faithfully
   and without counterfeit.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan. ii, 78: It may appear to be a contradiction,
   that Matthew and Mark after mentioning "two days" and "the Passover",
   and afterwards that Jesus was in Bethany, where that precious ointment
   is mentioned; whilst John, just before he speaks of the anointing,
   says, that Jesus came into Bethany six days before the feast. [John
   12:1] But those persons who are troubled by this, are not aware that
   Matthew and Mark do not place that anointing in Bethany immediately
   after that two days of which he foretold, but by way of recapitulation
   at the time when there were yet six days to the Passover.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Again in a mystic sense, Simon the leper means the
   world, first infidel, and afterwards converted, and the woman with the
   alabaster box, means the faith of The Church, who says, My spikenard
   sendeth forth its smell. It is called pistic nard, that is, faithful
   and precious. The house filled with the smell of it is heaven and
   earth; the broken alabaster box is carnal desire, which is broken at
   the Head, from which the whole body is framed together, whilst He was
   reclining, that is, humbling Himself, that the faith of the sinner
   might be able to reach Him, for she went up from the feet to the head,
   and down from the head to the feet by faith, that is, to Christ and to
   His members.

   It goes on: "And there were some that had indignation within
   themselves, and said, Why was this loss of the ointment?"

   By the figure synecdoche, one is put for many, and many for one; for it
   is the lost Judas who finds loss in salvation; thus in the fruitful
   vine rises the snare of death. Under the cover of his avarice, however,
   the mystery of faith speaks; for our faith is bought for three hundred
   pence, in our ten senses (denarii, i.e. ten senses), that is, our
   inward and outward senses which are again trebled by our body, soul and
   spirit.

   Bede: and in that he says, "And they murmured against her," we must not
   understand this to be spoken of the faithful Apostles, but rather of
   Judas mentioned in the plural.

   Theophylact: Or else, it appears to be aptly implied that many
   disciples murmured against the woman, because they had often heard our
   Lord talking of alms. Judas, however, was indignant, but not with the
   same feeling, but on account of his love of money, and filthy gain;
   wherefore John also records him alone, as accusing the woman with a
   fraudulent intent. But he says, "They murmured against her," meaning
   that they troubled her with reproaches, and hard words. Then Our Lord
   reproves His disciples, for throwing obstacles against the wish of the
   woman.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And Jesus said, Let her alone, why trouble ye
   her?" For after she had brought her gift, they wished to prevent her
   purpose by their reproaches.

   Origen, on Matthew, 35: For they were grieved at the waste of the
   ointment, which might be sold for a large sum and given to the poor.
   This however ought not to have been, for it was right that it should be
   poured over the head of Christ, with a holy and fitting stream;
   wherefore it goes on, "She hath wrought a good work on me."

   And so effectual is the praise of this good work, that it ought to
   excite all of us to fill the head of the Lord with sweet-smelling and
   rich offerings, that of us it may be said that we have done a good work
   over the head of the Lord. For we always have with us, as long as we
   remain in this life, the poor who have need of the care of those who
   have made progress in the word, and are enriched in the wisdom of God;
   they are not however able always day and night to have with them the
   Son of God, that is, the Word and Wisdom of God.

   For it goes on: "For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever
   ye will ye may do them good; but me ye have not always.

   Bede: To me, indeed, He seems to speak of His bodily presence, that He
   should by no means be with them after His Resurrection, as He then was
   living with them in all familiarity.

   Pseudo-Jerome: He says also, "She hath wrought a good work on me," for
   whosoever believes on the Lord, it is counted unto Him for
   righteousness. For it is one thing to believe Him, and to believe on
   Him, that is, to cast ourselves entirely upon Him.

   It goes on: "She hath done what she could, she is come aforehand to
   anoint My Body to the burying."

   Bede: As if the Lord said, What ye think is a waste of ointment is the
   service of my burial.

   Theophylact: For "She is come aforehand" as though led by God "to
   anoint my body", as a sign of my approaching burial; by which He
   confounds the traitor, as if He said, With what conscience canst thou
   confound the woman, who anoints my body to the burial, and dost not
   confound thyself, who wilt deliver me to death? But the Lord makes a
   double prophecy; one that the Gospel shall be preached over the whole
   world, another that the dead of the woman shall be praised.

   Wherefore it goes on: "Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this Gospel
   shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath
   done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her."

   Bede: Observe, also, that as Mary won glory throughout the whole world
   for the service which she rendered to the Lord, so, on the contrary, he
   who was bold enough to reprove her service, is held in infamy far and
   wide; but the Lord in rewarding the good the due praise has passed over
   in silence the future shame of the impious.

   10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the Chief Priests,
   to betray Him unto them.

   11. And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him
   money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: The unhappy Judas wishes to compensate with the price of his
   Master for the loss which he thought he had made by the pouring out of
   the ointment.

   Where it is said: "And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the
   Chief Priests to betray Him unto them."

   Chrysostom, de Prod. Jud., Homily 1: Why dost thou tell me of his
   country? would that I could also have been ignorant of his existence.
   But there was another disciple called Judas the zealot, the brother of
   James, and lest by calling him by this name there should arise a
   confusion between the two, he separates the one from the other. But he
   says not Judas the traitor, that he may teach us to be guiltless of
   detraction, and to avoid accusing others. In that however he says, "one
   of the twelve", he enhanced the detestable guilt of the traitor; for
   there were seventy other disciples, these however were not so intimate
   with Him, nor admitted to such familiar intercourse. But these twelve
   were approved by Him, these were the regal band, out of which the
   wicked traitor came forth.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But he was one of the twelve in number, not in merit,
   one in body, not in soul. But he went to the Chief Priests after he
   went out and Satan entered into him. Every living thing unites with
   what is like itself.

   Bede: But by the words, "he went out", it is shown that he was not
   invited by the Chief Priests, nor bound by any necessity, but entered
   upon this design from the spontaneous wickedness of his own mind.

   Theophylact: It is said, to "betray him unto them", that is, to
   announce to them when He should be alone. But they feared to rush upon
   Him when He was teaching, for fear of the people.

   Pseudo-Jerome: And he promises to betray Him, as his master the devil
   said before, "All this power I will give thee." [Luke 4:6]

   It goes on, "And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to
   give him money." They promise him money, and they lose their life,
   which he also loses on receiving the money.

   Chrysostom: Oh! the madness, yes, the avarice of the traitor, for his
   covetousness brought forth all the evil. For covetousness retains the
   souls which it has taken, and confines them in every way when it has
   bound them, and makes them forget all things, maddening their minds.
   Judas, taken captive by this madness of avarice, forgets the
   conversation, the table of Christ, his own discipleship, Christ's
   warnings and persuasion.

   For there follows, "And he sought how he might conveniently betray
   Him."

   Pseudo-Jerome: No opportunity for treachery can be found, such that it
   can escape vengeance here or there.

   Bede: Many in this day shudder at the crime of Judas in selling his
   Master, his Lord and his God, for money, as monstrous and horrible
   wickedness. They however do not take heed, for when the sake of gain
   they trample on the rights of charity and truth, they are traitors to
   God, Who is Charity and Truth.

   12. And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
   Passover, His disciples said unto Him: Where wilt Thou that we go and
   prepare that Thou mayest eat the Passover?

   13. And He sendeth forth two of His disciples, and saith unto them: Go
   ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of
   water - follow him.

   14. And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house,
   The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the
   Passover with My disciples?

   15. And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared:
   there make ready for us.

   16. And His disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as
   He had said unto them: and they made ready the Passover.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chrysostom: Whilst Judas was plotting how to betray Him, the rest of
   the disciples were taking care of the preparation of the Passover:
   where it is said, "And the first day of unleavened bread, when they
   killed the Passover, His disciples said unto Him, Where wilt thou that
   we go and prepare where thou mayest eat the Passover?' "

   Bede: He means by the first day of the Passover the fourteenth day of
   the first month, when they throw aside leaven, and were wont to
   sacrifice, that is, to kill the lamb at even. The Apostle explaining
   this says, "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us." [1 Cor 5:7].

   For although He was crucified on the next day, that is, on the
   fifteenth moon, yet on the night when the lamb was offered up, He
   committed to His disciples the Mysteries of His Body and Blood, which
   they were to celebrate, and was seized upon and bound by the Jews; thus
   He consecrated the beginning of His Sacrifice, that is, of His Passion.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But the unleavened bread which was eaten with
   bitterness, that is with bitter herbs, is our redemption, and the
   bitterness is the Passion of Our Lord.

   Theophylact: From the words of the disciples, "Where wilt thou that we
   go?", it seems evident that Christ had no dwelling-place, and that the
   disciples had no houses of their own; for if so, they would have taken
   Him thither.

   Pseudo-Jerome: For they say, "Where wilt thou that we go?", to shew us
   that we should direct our steps according to the Will of God. But the
   Lord points out with whom He would eat the Passover, and after His
   custom He sends two disciples, which we have explained above; wherefore
   it goes on, "And He sendeth forth two of His disciples, and He saith
   unto them, Go ye into the city.' "

   Theophylact: He sent two of His disciples, that is, Peter and John, as
   Luke says, to a man unknown to Him, implying by this that He might, if
   He had pleased, have avoided His Passion. For what could not He work in
   other men, who influenced the mind of a person unknown to Him, so that
   he received them? He also gives them a sign how they were to know the
   house, when He adds, "And there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher
   of water."

   Augustine, de Con. Evan, ii, 80: Mark says a pitcher, Luke a two-handed
   vessel; one points out the kind of vessel, the other the mode of
   carrying it; both however mean the same truth.

   Bede: And it is a proof of the presence of His divinity, that in
   speaking with His disciples, He knows what is to take place elsewhere;
   wherefore it follows, "And His disciples went forth, and came into the
   city, and found as He had said unto them; and they made ready the
   Passover."

   Chrysostom: Not our Passover, but in the meanwhile that of the Jews;
   but He did not only appoint ours, but Himself became our Passover. Why
   too did He eat it? Because He was "made under the Law, to redeem them
   that were under the Law," [Gal 4:4] and Himself gave rest to the Law.
   And lest any one should say that He did away with it, because He could
   not fulfil its hard and difficult obedience, He first Himself fulfilled
   it, and then set it to rest.

   Pseudo-Jerome: And in a mystical sense the city is The Church,
   surrounded by the wall of faith, the man who meets them is the
   primitive people, the pitcher of water is the law of the letter.

   Bede: Or else, the water is the laver of grace, the pitcher points out
   the weakness of those who were to shew that grace to the world.

   Theophylact: He who is baptized carries the pitcher of water, and he
   who bears baptism upon him comes to his rest, if he lives according to
   his reason; and he obtains rest, as being in the house.

   Wherefore it is added, "Follow Him."

   Pseudo-Jerome: That is, him who leads to the lofty place, where is the
   refreshment prepared by Christ. The lord of the house is the Apostle,
   Peter, to who the Lord has entrusted His house, that there may be one
   faith under one Shepherd. [ref John 21:15] The large upper-room is the
   wide-spread Church, in which the Name of the Lord is spoken of,
   prepared by a variety of powers and tongues.

   Bede: Or else, the large upper-room is spiritually the Law, which comes
   forth from the narrowness of the letter, and in a lofty place, that is,
   in the lofty chamber of the soul, receives the Saviour. But it is
   designedly that the names both of the bearer of the water, and of the
   lord of the house, are omitted, to imply that power is given to all who
   wish to celebrate the true Passover, that is, to be embued with the
   Sacraments of Christ, and to receive Him in the dwelling-place of their
   mind.

   Theophylact: Or else, the lord of the house is the intellect, which
   points out the large upper room, that is, the loftiness of
   intelligences, and which, though it be high, yet has nothing of vain
   glory, or of pride, but is prepared and made level by humility. But
   there, that is, in such a mind Christ's Passover is prepared by Peter
   and John, that is by action and contemplation.

   17. And in the evening He cometh with The Twelve.

   18. And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you,
   one of you which eateth with me shall betray me."

   19. And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto Him one by one, "Is
   it I?" And another said, "Is it I?"

   20. And He answered and said unto them, "It is one of The Twelve, that
   dippeth with Me in the dish."

   21. "The Son of Man indeed goeth, as it is written of Him: but woe to
   that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! good were it for that man
   if he had never been born."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: The Lord Who had foretold His Passion, prophesied also of the
   traitor, in order to give him room for repentance, that understanding
   that his thoughts were known, he might repent. Wherefore it is said,
   "And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. And as they sat and did
   eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me
   shall betray me."

   Chrysostom: Where it is evident that He did not proclaim him openly to
   all, lest He should make him the more shameless; at the same time He
   did not altogether keep it silent, lest thinking that he was not
   discovered, he should boldly hasten to betray Him.

   Theophylact: But how could they eat reclining, when the law ordered
   that standing and upright they should eat the Passover? It is probable
   that they had first fulfilled the legal Passover, and had reclined,
   when He began to give them His own Passover.

   Pseudo-Jerome: The evening of the day points out the evening of the
   world; for the last, who are the first to receive the penny of eternal
   life, come about the eleventh hour. All the disciples then are touched
   by the Lord; so that there is amongst them the harmony of the harp, all
   the well attuned strings answer with accordant tone; for it goes on:
   "And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto Him one by one, Is it
   I?"

   One of them however, unstrung, and steeped in the love of money, said,
   "Is it I, Lord?", as Matthew testifies.

   Theophylact: But the other disciples began to be saddened on account of
   the word of the Lord; for although they were free from this passion,
   yet they trust Him Who knows all hearts, rather than themselves.

   It goes on: "And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the
   twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish."

   Bede: That is, Judas, who when the others were sad and held back their
   hands, puts forth his hand with his Master into the dish. And because
   He had before said, One of you shall betray me, and yet the traitor
   perseveres in his evil, He accuses him more openly, without however
   pointing out his name.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Again, He says, "One out of the twelve", as it were,
   separate from them, for the wolf carries away from the flock the sheep
   which he has taken, and the sheep which quits the fold lies open to the
   bite of the wolf. But Judas does not withdraw his foot from his
   traitorous design though once and again pointed at, wherefore his
   punishment is foretold, that the death denounced upon him might correct
   him, whom shame could not overcome; wherefore it goes on: "The Son of
   Man indeed goeth, as it is written of Him."

   Theophylact: The word here used, "goeth", shews that the death of
   Christ was not forced, but voluntary.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But because many do good, in the way that Judas did,
   without its profiting them, there follows: "Woe to that man by whom the
   Son of Man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been
   born."

   Bede: Woe, too, to that man, today and forever, who comes to the Lord's
   table with an evil intent. For he, after the example of Judas, betrays
   the Lord, not indeed to Jewish sinners, but to his own sinning members.

   It goes on: "Good were it for that man if he had never been born."

   Pseudo-Jerome: That is, hidden in his mother's inmost womb, for it is
   better for a man not to exist than to exist for torments.

   Theophylact: For as respects the end for which he was designed, it
   would have been better for him to have been born, if he had not been
   the betrayer, for God created him for good works; but after he had
   fallen into such dreadful wickedness, it would have been better for him
   never to have been born.

   22. And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it,
   and gave to them, and said, "Take, eat: This is My Body."

   23. and He took the cup, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to
   them, and they all drank of it.

   24. And He said unto them, "This is My Blood of the New Testament,
   which is shed for many."

   25. "Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the
   vine, until that day that I drink It new in the Kingdom of God."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: When the rites of the old Passover were finished, He passed to
   the new, in order, that is, to substitute the Sacrament of His own Body
   and Blood, for the flesh and blood of the lamb. Wherefore there
   follows: "And as they did eat, Jesus took bread"; that is, in order to
   shew that He, Himself, is that person to whom the Lord swore, "Thou art
   a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedec." [Ps 100:4]

   There follows: "And blessed, and brake it."

   Theophylact: That is, giving thanks, He brake it, which we also do,
   with the addition of some prayers.

   Bede: He Himself also breaks the bread, which He gives to His
   disciples, to shew that the breaking of His Body was to take place, not
   against His Will, nor without His intervention; He also blessed it,
   because He with the Father and the Holy Spirit filled His human nature,
   which He took upon Him in order to suffer, with the grace of Divine
   power. He blessed bread and brake it, because He deigned to subject to
   death His manhood, which He had taken upon Him in such a way as to shew
   that there was within it the power of Divine immortality, and to teach
   them that therefore He would the more quickly raise it from the dead.

   There follows: "And gave to them, and said, Take, eat: This is My
   Body.' "

   Theophylact: That, namely, which I now give and which ye take. But the
   bread is not a mere figure of the Body of Christ, but is changed into
   the very Body of Christ. For the Lord said, "The bread which I give you
   is My Flesh." But the Flesh of Christ is veiled from our eyes on
   account of our weakness, for bread and wine are things to which we are
   accustomed, if however we saw flesh and blood we could not bear to take
   them. For this reason the Lord bending Himself to our weakness keeps
   the forms of bread and wine, but changes the bread and wine into the
   reality of His Body and Blood.

   Chrysostom: Even now also that Christ is close to us; He Who prepared
   that table, Himself also consecrates it. For it is not man who makes
   the offerings to be the Body and Blood of Christ, but Christ Who was
   crucified for us. The words are spoken by the mouth of the Priest, and
   are consecrated by the power and the grace of God. By this word which
   He spoke, "This is My Body", the offerings are consecrated; and as that
   word which says, "Increase and multiply, and fill the earth," [Gen
   1:28] was sent forth but once, yet has its effect throughout all time,
   when nature does the work of generation; so also that voice was spoken
   once, yet gives confirmation to the Sacrifice through all the tables of
   The Church even to this day, even to His advent.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But in a mystical sense, the Lord transfigures into
   bread His Body, which is the present Church, which is received in
   faith, is blessed in its number, is broken in its sufferings, is given
   in its examples, is taken in its doctrines; and He forms His Blood in
   the chalice of water and wine mingled together, that by one we may be
   purged from our sins, by the other redeemed from their punishment
   [formans sanguinem suum ap. I's eudo-Hier]. For by the blood of the
   lamb our houses are preserved from the smiting of the Angel, and our
   enemies perish in the waters of the Red Sea, which are the Sacraments
   of the Church of Christ.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He took the cup, and when He had given
   thanks, He gave it to them." For we are saved by the grace of the Lord,
   not by our own deserts.

   Gregory, Mor. ii, 37: When His Passion was approaching, He is said to
   have taken bread and given thanks. He therefore gave thanks, Who took
   upon Him the stripes of other men's wickedness; He Who did nothing
   worthy of smiting, humbly gives a blessing in His Passion, to shew us,
   what each should do when beaten for his own sins, since He Himself bore
   calmly the stripes due to the sin of others; furthermore to shew us,
   what we who are the subjects of the Father should do under correction,
   when He Who is His equal gave thanks under the lash.

   Bede: The wine of the Lord's cup is mixed with water, because we should
   remain in Christ and Christ in us. For on the testimony of John, the
   waters are the people, [Rev 17:15] and it is not lawful for any one to
   offer either wine alone, or water alone, lest such an oblation should
   mean that the head may be severed from the members, and either that
   Christ could suffer without love for our redemption, and that we can be
   saved or be offered to the Father without His Passion.

   It goes on: "And they all drank of it."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Happy intoxication, saving fulness, which the more we
   drink gives the greater sobriety of mind!

   Theophylact: Some say that Judas did not partake in these Mysteries,
   but that he went out before the Lord gave the Sacrament. Some again say
   that He gave him also of that Sacrament.

   Chrysostom: For Christ offered His Blood to him who betrayed Him, that
   he might have remission of his sins, if he had chosen to cease to be
   wicked.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Judas therefore drinks and is not satisfied, nor can he
   quench the thirst of the everlasting fire, because he unworthily
   partakes of the Mysteries of Christ. There are some in The Church whom
   the Sacrifice does not cleanse, but their foolish thought draws them on
   to sin, for they have plunged themselves in the stinking slough of
   cruelty.

   Chrysostom: Let there not be therefore a Judas at the table of the
   Lord; this Sacrifice is spiritual food, for as bodily food, working on
   a belly filled with humours which are opposed to it, is hurtful, so
   this spiritual food if taken by one polluted with wickedness, rather
   brings him to perdition, not by its own nature, but through the fault
   of the recipient. Let therefore our mind be pure in all things, and our
   thought pure, for that Sacrifice is pure.

   There follows: "And He said unto them, This is My Blood of the New
   Testament, which is shed for many.' "

   Bede: This refers to the different circumstances of the Old Testament,
   which was consecrated by the blood of calves and of goats; and the
   lawgiver said in sprinking it, "This is the blood of the Testament
   which God has injoined unto you." [Heb 9:19-20, ref. Ex 24:8]

   It goes on: "Which is shed for many."

   Pseudo-Jerome: For it does not cleanse all.

   It goes on: "Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit
   of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God."

   Theophylact: As if He had said, I will not drink wine until the
   Resurrection; for He calls His Resurrection "the kingdom", as He then
   reigned over death. But after His Resurrection He ate and drank with
   His disciples, shewing that it was He Himself who had suffered. But He
   drank it "new", that is, in a new and strange manner, for He had not a
   body subject to suffering, and requiring food, but immortal and
   incorruptible.

   We may also understand it in this way. The vine is the Lord Himself. By
   the offspring (genimen) of the vine is meant mysteries, and the secret
   understanding, which He Himself begets (gererat), Who teaches man
   knowledge. But in the kingdom of God, that is, in the world to come, He
   will drink with His disciples mysteries and knowledge, teaching us new
   things, and revealing what He now hides.

   Bede: Or else, Isaiah testifies that the synagogue is called the vine
   or the vineyard of the Lord, saying, "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts
   is the house of Israel." [Isa 5:7] The Lord therefore when about to go
   to His Passion, says, "I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine,"
   as if He had said openly, I will no longer delight in the carnal rites
   of the synagogue, in which also these rites of the Paschal Lamb have
   held the chief place. For the time of My Resurrection shall come, that
   day shall come, when in the kingdom of Heaven, that is, raised on high
   with the glory of immortal life, I will be filled with a new joy,
   together with you, for the salvation of the same people born again of
   the fountain of spiritual grace.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But we must consider that here the Lord changes the
   sacrifice without changing the time; so that we never celebrate the
   Caena Domini before the fourteenth moon. He who celebrates the
   Resurrection on the fourteenth moon, will celebrate the Caena Domini on
   the eleventh moon, which was never done in either Old or New Testament.

   26. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of

   will not deny thee in any wise." Likewise, also, said they all.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: As they returned thanks, before they drank, so they return
   thanks after drinking; wherefore it is said, "And when they had sung an
   hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives," to teach us to return
   thanks both before and after our food.

   Pseudo-Jerome: For by a hymn he means the praise of the Lord, as is
   said in the Psalms [Ps 22, 26, 29], "The poor shall eat and be
   satisfied; they that seek after the Lord shall praise Him." And again,
   "All such as be fat upon earth have eaten and worshipped."

   Theophylact: He also shews by this that He was glad to die for us,
   because when about to be betrayed, He deigned to praise God. He also
   teaches us when we fall into troubles for the sake of the salvation of
   many, not to be sad, but to give thanks to God, Who through our
   distress works the salvation of many.

   Bede: That hymn in the Gospel of John may also be meant, which the Lord
   sang, returning thanks to the Father, in which also He prayed, raising
   His eyes to Heaven, for Himself and His disciples, and those who were
   to believe, through their word.

   Theophylact: Again, He went out into a mountain, that they might come
   to Him in a lonely place, and take Him without tumult. For if they had
   come to Him, whilst He was abiding in the city, the multitude of the
   people would have been in an uproar, and then His enemies, who took
   occasion against Him, should seem to have slain Him justly, because He
   stirred up the people.

   Bede: Beautifully also does the Lord lead out His disciples, when they
   had tasted His Sacraments, into the mount of Olives, to shew typically
   that we ought through the reception of the Sacraments to rise up to
   higher gifts of virtue, and graces of the Holy Ghost, that we may be
   anointed in heart.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Jesus also is held captive on the mount of Olives,
   whence He ascended to Heaven, that we may know, that we ascend into
   Heaven from that place in which we watch and pray; there we are bound
   and do not tend back again to earth.

   Bede: But the Lord foretells to His disciples what is about to happen
   to them, that when they have gone through it, they may not despair of
   salvation, but work out their repentance, and be freed.

   Wherefore there follows: "And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be
   offended because of Me this night."

   Pseudo-Jerome: All indeed fall, but all do not remain fallen. For shall
   not he who sleeps also rise up again? [Ps 40:9] It is a carnal thing to
   fall, but devilish to remain lying when fallen.

   Theophylact: The Lord allowed them to fall that they might not trust in
   themselves, and lest He should seem to have prophesied, what He had
   said, as an open accusation of them, He brings forward the witness of
   Zechariah the Prophet; wherefore it goes on: "For it is written, I will
   smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered." [Zech 13:7]

   Bede: This is written in different words in Zecharias, and in the
   person of the Prophet it is said to the Lord, "Smite the shepherd, and
   the sheep shall be scattered."

   Pseudo-Jerome: For the Prophet prays for the Passion of the Lord, and
   the Father answers, I will smite the shepherd according to the prayers
   of those below. The Son is sent and smitten by the Father, that is, He
   is made Incarnate and suffers.

   Theophylact: But the Father say, "I will smite the shepherd," because
   He permitted him to be smitten. He calls the disciples sheep, as being
   innocent and without guile. At last He consoles them, by saying, "But
   after that I am risen I will go before you into Galilee."

   Pseudo-Jerome: In which the true Resurrection is promised, that their
   hope may not be extinguished. There follows: "But Peter said unto Him,
   Although all shall be offended, yet will not I." Lo a bird unfledged
   strives to raise itself on high; but the body weighs down the soul, so
   that the fear of the Lord is overcome by the fear of human death.

   Bede: Peter then promised in the ardour of his faith, and the Saviour
   as God knew what was to happen.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
   that this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou
   shalt deny me thrice."

   Augustine, de Con. Even. iii, 2: Though all the Evangelists say that
   the Lord foretold that Peter was to deny before the cock crew, Mark
   alone has related it more minutely, wherefore some from inattention
   suppose that he does not agree with the others.

   For the whole of Peter's denial is threefold; if it had begun
   altogether after the cock crew, the other three Evangelist would seem
   to have spoken falsely, in saying, that before the cock crew, he would
   deny Him thrice. Again, if he had finished the entire threefold denial
   before the cock began to crow, Mark would in the person of the Lord
   seem to have said needlessly, "Before the cock crow twice, thou shall
   deny Me thrice."

   But because that threefold denial began before the first cock-crowing,
   the other three did not notice when Peter was to finish it, but how
   great it was to be, that is, threefold, and when it was to begin, that
   is, before the cock crew, although the whole was conceived in his mind,
   even before the first cock crew; but Mark has related more plainly the
   interval between his words themselves.

   Theophylact: We are to understand that it happened thus; Peter denied
   once, then the cock crew for the second time.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Who is the cock, the harbinger of day, but the Holy
   Ghost? by whose voice in prophecy, and in the Apostles, we are roused
   from our threefold denial, to most bitter tears after our fall, for we
   have thought evil of God, spoken evil of our neighbours, and done evil
   to ourselves.

   Bede: The faith of the Apostle Peter, and his burning love for our
   Lord, is shewn in what follows.

   For it goes on: "But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with
   Thee, I will not deny Thee in any wise."

   Theophylact: The other disciples also shewed a fearless zeal. For there
   follows, "Likewise also said they all," but nevertheless they acted
   against the truth, which Christ had prophesied.

   32. And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and He saith
   to His disciples, "Sit ye here, while I shall pray."

   33. And He taketh with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be
   sore amazed, and to be very heavy;

   34. And saith unto them, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death:
   tarry ye here, and watch."

   35. And He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed
   that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him.

   36. And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto Thee; take
   away this cup from Me: nevertheless not what I will, but what Thou
   wilt.

   37. And He cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
   "Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?"

   38. "Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly
   is ready, but the flesh is weak."

   39. And again He went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.

   40. And when He returned, He found them asleep, again, (for their eyes
   were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer Him.

   41. And He cometh the third time, and saith unto them, "Sleep on now,
   and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of
   Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."

   42. "Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth Me is at hand."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss: After that the Lord had foretold the offence of His disciples,
   the Evangelist gives an account of His prayer, in which He is supposed
   to have prayed for His disciples; and first describing the place of
   prayer, he says, "And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane."

   Bede: The place Gethsemane, in which the Lord prayed, is shewn up to
   this day at the foot of the Mount of Olives. The meaning of Gethsemane
   is, the valley of the fat, or of fatness. Now when our Lord prays on a
   mountain, He teaches us that we should when we pray ask for lofty
   things; but by praying in the valley of fatness, He implies that in our
   prayer humility and the fatness of interior love must be kept. He also
   by the valley of humility and the fatness of charity underwent death
   for us.

   Pseudo-Jerome: In the valley of fatness also, the fat bulls beset Him.
   There follows, "And He saith to His disciples, Sit ye here, while I
   shall pray;" they are separated from Him in prayer, who are separated
   in His Passion; for He prays, they sleep, overcome by the sloth of
   their heart.

   Theophylact: It was also His custom always to pray by Himself, in order
   to give us an example, to seek for silence and solitude in our prayers.
   There follows: "And He taketh with Him Peter, and James and John." He
   takes only those who had been witnesses of His glory on Mount Tabor,
   that they who had seen His glory might also see His sufferings, and
   learn that He is really man, in that He is sorrowful.

   Wherefore there follows: "And began to be sore amazed, and very heavy."
   For since He had taken on Himself the whole of human nature, He took
   also those natural things which belong to man, amazement, heaviness,
   and sorrow; for men are naturally unwilling to die.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He saith unto them, My soul is exceeding
   sorrowful unto death."

   Bede: As being God, dwelling in the body, He shews the frailty of
   flesh, that the blasphemy of those who deny the Mystery of His
   Incarnation might find no place; for having taken up a body, He must
   needs also take up all that belongs to the body, hunger, thirst, pain,
   grief; for the Godhead cannot suffer the changes of those affections.

   Theophylact: but some have understood this, as if He had said, I am
   sorrowful, not because I am to die, but because the Jews, My
   countrymen, are about to crucify Me, and by these means to be shut out
   from the kingdom of God.

   Pseudo-Jerome: By this also we are taught to fear and to be sorrowful
   before the judgment of death, for not by ourselves, but by Him only,
   can we say, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me."
   [John 14:30]

   There follows: "Tarry ye, here, and watch."

   Bede: He does not mean natural sleep by the sleep which He forbids, for
   the time of approaching danger did not allow of it, but the sleep of
   unfaithfulness, and the torpor of the mind. But going forward a little,
   He falls on His face, and shews His lowliness of mind, by the posture
   of His body.

   Wherefore there follows: "And He went forward a little, and fell on the
   ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from
   Him."

   Augustine, de Con. iii, iv: He said not, if He could do it, but if it
   could be done; for whatever He wills is possible. We must therefore
   understand, "if it be possible," as if it were; if He is willing. And
   lest any one should suppose that He lessened His Father's power, He
   shews in what sense the words are to be understood; for there follows,
   "And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto Thee."

   By which He sufficiently shows that the words, "if it be possible,"
   must be understood not of any impossibility, but of the Will of His
   Father. As to what Mark relates that He said not only Father, but
   "Abba, Father", Abba is the Hebrew for Father. And perhaps the Lord
   said both words, on account of some Sacrament contained in them;
   wishing to shew that He had taken upon Himself that sorrow in the
   person of His body, The Church, to which He was made the chief
   cornerstone, and which came to Him, partly from the Hebrews, who are
   represented by the word, "Abba", partly from the Gentiles, to whom
   "Father" belongs.

   Bede: But He prays, that the cup may pass away, to shew that He is very
   man, wherefore He adds: "Take away this cup from Me." But remembering
   why He was sent, He accomplishes the dispensation for which He was
   sent, and cries out, "But not what I Will, but what Thou Wilt." As if
   He had said, If death can die, without My dying according to the flesh,
   let this cup pass away; but since this cannot be otherwise, "not what I
   Will, but what Thou Wilt."

   Many still are sad at the prospect of death, but let them keep their
   heart right, and avoid death as much as they can; but if they cannot,
   then let them say what the Lord said of us.

   Pseudo-Jerome: By which also He ceases not up to the end to teach us to
   obey our fathers, and to prefer their will to ours. There follows: "And
   he cometh, and findeth them sleeping." For as they are asleep in mind,
   so also in body.

   Theophylact: But after His prayer, the Lord coming, and seeing His
   disciples sleeping, rebukes Peter alone. Wherefore it goes on: "And
   saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch with me
   one hour?

   As if He had said, If thou couldest not watch one hour with me, how
   wilt thou be able to despise death, thou who promisest to die with Me?

   It goes on: "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation," that
   is, the temptation of denying Me.

   Bede: He does not say, Pray that ye may not be tempted, because it is
   impossible for the human mind not to be tempted, but that ye enter not
   into temptation, that is, that temptation may not vanquish you.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But he is said to enter into temptation, who neglects to
   pray.

   There follows: "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

   Theophylact: As if He had said, Your spirit indeed is ready not to deny
   me, and for this reason ye promise; but your flesh is weak, in that
   unless God give power to your flesh through prayer, ye shall enter into
   temptation.

   Bede: He here represses the rash, who think that they can compass
   whatever they are confident about. But in proportion as we are
   confident from the ardour of our mind, so let us fear from the weakness
   of our flesh.

   For this place makes against those, who say that there was but one
   operation in the Lord and one Will. For He shews two wills, one human,
   which from the weakness of the flesh shrinks from suffering; one
   divine, which is most ready.

   It goes on: "And again He went away and prayed, and spake the same
   words."

   Theophylact: That by His second prayer He might shew Himself to be very
   man. It goes on: "And when He returned, He found them asleep again;" He
   however did not rebuke them severely. "For their eyes were heavy, (that
   is, with sleep,) neither wist they what to answers Him." By this learn
   the weakness of men, and let us not, whom even sleep can overcome,
   promise things which are impossible to us. Therefore He goes away the
   third time to pray the prayer mentioned above.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And He cometh the third time, and saith unto
   them, Sleep on now, and take your rest." He is not vehement against
   them, though after His rebuke they had done worse, but He tells them
   ironically, "Sleep on now, and take your rest," because He knew that
   the betrayer was now close at hand. And that He spoke ironically is
   evident, by what is added; "It is enough, the hour is come; behold, the
   Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners." He speaks this, as
   deriding their sleep, as if He had said; Now indeed is a time for
   sleep, when the traitor is approaching.

   Then He says; "Arise, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth Me is at hand."

   Augustine: Or else; In that it is said, that after He had spoken these
   words, "Sleep on now, and take your rest," He added, "It is enough,"
   and then, "the hour is come; behold, the Son of Man is betrayed," we
   must understand that after saying, "Sleep on now, and take your rest,"
   our Lord remained silent for a short time, to give space for that to
   happen, which He had permitted; and then that He added, "the hour is
   come;" and therefore He puts in between, "it is enough," that is, your
   rest has been long enough.

   Pseudo-Jerome: The threefold sleep of the disciples points out the
   three dead, whom our Lord raised up; the first, in a house; the second,
   at the tomb; the third, from the tomb. And the threefold watch of the
   Lord teaches us in our prayers, to beg for the pardon of past, future
   and present sins.

   43. And immediately, while He yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
   twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the
   Chief Priests and the Scribes and the elders.

   44. And he that betrayed Him had given them a token, saying,
   "Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away
   safely."

   45. And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to Him, and saith,
   "Master, master;" and kissed Him.

   46. And they laid their hands on Him, and took Him.

   47. And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of
   the High Priest, and cut off his ear.

   48. And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Are ye come out, as against
   a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?"

   49. "I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took Me not:
   but the Scriptures must be fulfilled."

   50. And they all forsook Him, and fled.

   51. And there followed Him a certain young man, having a linen cloth
   cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:

   52. And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: After that our Lord had prayed three times, and had obtained by
   His prayers that the fear of the Apostles should be amended by future
   repentance, He, being tranquil as to His Passion, goes to His
   persecutors, concerning the coming of whom the Evangelist says, "And
   immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas Iscariot, on of the
   twelve."

   Theophylact: This is not put without reason, but to the greater
   conviction of the traitor, since though he was of the chief company
   amongst the disciples, he turned himself to furious enmity against our
   Lord.

   There follows: "And with him a great multitude with swords and staves
   from the Chief Priests and the Scribes and the elders."

   Pseudo-Jerome: For he who despairs of help from God, has recourse to
   the power of the world.

   Bede: But Judas had still something of the shame of a disciple, for he
   did not openly betray Him to His persecutors, but by the token of a
   kiss.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And he that betrayed Him had given them a token,
   saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead
   him away safely."

   Theophylact: See how in his blindness he thought to deceive Christ by
   the kiss, so as to be looked upon by Him as His friend. But if thou
   wert a friend, Judas, how didst thou come with His enemies? But
   wickedness is ever without foresight.

   It goes on: "And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to Him,
   and saith, Master, master; and kissed Him."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Judas gives the kiss as a token, with poisonous guile,
   just as Cain offered a crafty, reprobate sacrifice.

   Bede: With envy and with a wicked confidence, he calls Him master, and
   gives Him a kiss, in betraying Him. But the Lord receives the kiss of
   the traitor, not to teach us to deceive, but lest he should seem to
   avoid betrayal, and at the same time to fulfil that Psalm, "Among them
   that are enemies unto peace, I labour for peace." [Ps 120:5]

   It goes on: "And they laid hands on Him, and took Him."

   Pseudo-Jerome: This is the Joseph who was sold by his brethren [Ps
   105:18], and into whose soul the iron entered. [note: this passage not
   found in the Venice ed. of the Pseudo-Jerome]

   There follows: "And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a
   servant of the High Priest, and cut off his ear."

   Bede: Peter did this, as John declares, with the same ardent mind with
   which he did all things; for he knew how Phineas had by punishing
   sacrilegious persons received the reward of righteousness and of
   perpetual priesthood.

   Theophylact: Mark conceals his name, lest he should seem to be praising
   his master for his zeal for Christ. Again, the action of Peter points
   out that they were disobedient and unbelieving, despising the
   Scriptures; for if they had ears to hear the Scriptures, they would not
   have crucified the Lord of glory. But he cut off the ear of a servant
   of the High Priest, for the Chief Priests especially passed over the
   Scriptures, like disobedient servants.

   It goes on: "And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
   against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?"

   Bede: As if He had said, it is foolish to seek with swords and staves
   Him, who offers Himself to you of His own accord, and to search, as for
   one who hides Himself, by night and by means of a traitor, for Him who
   taught daily in the temple.

   Theophylact: This, however, is a proof of His divinity, for when He
   taught in the temple they were unable to take Him, although He was in
   their power, because the time of His Passion had not yet come; but when
   He Himself was willing, then He gave Himself up, that the Scriptures
   might be fulfilled, "for he was led as a lamb to the slaughter," not
   crying nor raising His voice, but suffering willingly.

   It goes on: "And they all forsook Him and fled."

   Bede: In this is fulfilled the word, which the Lord had spoken, that
   all His disciples should be offended in Him that same night.

   There follows: "And there followed Him a certain young man, having a
   linen cloth cast about his naked body," that is, he had no other
   clothing but this linen cloth.

   It goes on: "And they laid hold on him, and he left the linen cloth,
   and fled from them naked." That is, he fled from them, whose presence
   and whose deeds he abhorred, not from the Lord, for Whom his love
   remained fixed in his mind, when absent from Him in body.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Just as Joseph left his mantle behind him, and fled
   naked from the wanton woman; so also let him, who would escape the
   hands of the evil ones, quit in mind all that is of the world, and fly
   after Jesus.

   Theophylact: It appears probable that this young man was of that house,
   where they had eaten the Passover. But some say that this young man was
   James, the brother of our Lord, who was called Just; who after the
   ascension of Christ received from the Apostles the throne of the
   bishopric of Jerusalem.

   Greg., Mor. 14, 49: Or, he says this of John, who, although he
   afterwards returned to the cross to hear the words of the Redeemer, at
   first was frightened and fled.

   Bede: For that he was a young man at that time, is evident from his
   long sojourn in the flesh. Perhaps he escaped from the hands of those
   who held him for the time, and afterwards got back his garment and
   returned, mingling under cover of the darkness with those who were
   leading Jesus, as though he was one of them, until he arrived at the
   door of the High Priest, to whom he was known, as he himself testifies
   in the Gospel. But as Peter, who washed away the sin of his denial with
   the tears of penitence, shews the recovery of those who fall away in
   time of martyrdom, so the other disciples who prevented their actual
   seizure, teach the prudence of flight to those who feel themselves
   unequal to undergo tortures.
     __________________________________________________________________

   53. And they led Jesus away to the High Priest: and with him were
   assembled all the Chief Priests and the elders and the Scribes.

   54. And Peter followed Him afar off, even into the palace of the High
   Priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.

   55. And the Chief Priests and all the council sought for witness
   against Jesus to put Him to death; and found none.

   56. For many bare false witness against Him, but their witness agreed
   not together.

   57. And there arose certain, and bare false witness against Him,
   saying,

   58. "We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with
   hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands."

   59. But neither so did their witness agree together.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss: The Evangelist had related above how our Lord had been taken by
   the servants of the Priests. Now he begins to relate how He was
   condemned to death in the house of the High Priest.

   Wherefore it is said: "And they led Jesus away to the High Priest."

   Bede: He means by the High Priest, Caiaphas, who (as John writes) was
   High Priest that year, of whom Josephus relates that he bought his
   priesthood of the Roman Emperor.

   There follows: "And with him were assembled all the Chief Priests and
   the elders and the scribes."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Then took place the gathering together of the bulls
   among the heifers of the people. [Ps 67:31, Vulgate]

   It goes on: "And Peter followed Him afar off, even into the palace of
   the High Priest."

   For though fear holds him back, love draws him on.

   Bede: But rightly does he follow afar off, who is just about to betray
   Him; for he could not have denied Christ if he had remained close to
   Him.

   There follows: "And he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the
   fire."

   Pseudo-Jerome: He warms himself at the fire in the hall, with the
   servants. The hall of the High Priest is the enclosure of the world,
   the servants are the devils, with whom whosoever remains cannot weep
   for his sins; the fire is the desire of the flesh.

   Bede: For charity is the fire of which it is said, "I am come to send
   fire on the earth," [Luke 12:49] which flame coming down on the
   believers, taught them to speak with various tongues the praise of the
   Lord. There is also a fire of covetousness, of which it is said, "They
   are all adulterers as an oven:" [Hosea (Osee) 7:4] this fire, raised up
   in the hall of Caiaphas by the suggestion of an evil spirit, was arming
   the tongues of the traitors to deny and blaspheme the Lord. For the
   fire lit up in the hall amidst the cold of the night was a figure of
   what the wicked assembly was doing within; for because of the abounding
   of iniquity the love of many waxes cold. [Matt 24:12] Peter, who for a
   time was benumbed by this cold, wished as it were to be warmed by the
   coals of the servants of Caiaphas, because He sought in the society of
   traitors the consolation of worldly comfort.

   It goes on: "And the Chief Priests and all the council sought for
   witness against Jesus to put Him to death."

   Theophylact: Though the law commanded that there should be but one High
   Priest, there were then many put into the office, and stripped of it,
   year by year, by the Roman emperor. He therefore calls chief priests
   those who had finished the time alloted to them, and had been stripped
   of their priesthood. But their actions are a sign of their judgment,
   which they carried on as they had prejudged, for they sought for a
   witness, that they might seem to condemn and destroy Jesus with
   justice.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But iniquity lied as the queen did against Joseph, and
   the priests against Susannah, but a flame goes out, if it has no fuel.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And found none. For many bare false witness
   against Him, but their witness agreed not together."

   For whatever is not consistent is held to be doubtful.

   There follows: "And there arose certain, and bare false witness against
   Him, saying, We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made
   with hands, and within three days I will build another made without
   hands."

   It is usual with heretics out of the truth to extract the shadow; He
   did not say what they said, but something like it, of the temple of His
   body, which He raised again after two days.

   Theophylact: For the Lord had not said, I will destroy, but, "Destroy",
   nor did He say, made with hands, but, "this temple."

   Bede: He had said also, "I will raise up," meaning a thing with life
   and soul, and a breathing temple. He is a false witness, who
   understands words in a sense, in which they are not spoken.
     __________________________________________________________________

   60. And the High Priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying,
   "Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?"

   61. But He held His peace, and answered nothing. Again the High Priest
   asked Him, and said unto Him, "Art thou the Christ, the Son of the
   Blessed?"

   62. And Jesus said, "I am: and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on
   the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven."

   63. Then the High Priest rent his clothes, and saith, "What need we any
   further witnesses?"

   64. "Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye?" And they all
   condemned Him to be guilty of death.

   65. And some began to spit on Him, and to cover His face, and to buffet
   Him, and to say unto Him, "Prophesy:" and the servants did strike Him
   with the palms of their hands.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: The more Jesus remained silent before the false witnesses who
   were unworthy of His answer, and the impious priests, the more the High
   Priest, overcome with anger, endeavoured to provoke Him to answer, that
   he might find room for accusing Him, from any thing whatever which He
   might say.

   Wherefore it is said, "And the High Priest stood up in the midst, and
   asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these
   witness against thee?"

   The High Priest, angry and impatient at finding no room for accusation
   against Him, rises from his seat, thus shewing by the motion of his
   body the madness of his mind.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But our God and Saviour Himself, Who brought salvation
   to the world, and assisted mankind by His love, is led as a sheep to
   the slaughter, without crying, and remained mute and "kept silence yea
   even from good words."

   Wherefore it goes on, "But He held His peace, and answered nothing."

   The silence of Christ is the pardon for the defence or excuse of Adam.
   [Gen 3:10]

   Theophylact: But He remained silent because He knew that they would not
   attend to His words, wherefore He answered according to Luke, "If I
   tell you, ye will not believe." [Luke 22:67]

   Wherefore there follows: "Again the High Priest asked Him, and said
   unto Him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"

   The High Priest indeed puts this question, not that he might learn of
   Him and believe, but in order to seek occasion against Him. But he
   asks, "Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed," because there were
   many Christs, that is, anointed persons, as Kings and High Priests, but
   none of these was called the Son of the Blessed God, that is, the
   Ever-praised.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But they looked from afar off for Him, whom though near
   they cannot see, as Isaac from the blindness of his eyes does not know
   Jacob who was under his hands, but prophecies long before things which
   were to come to him.

   It goes on: "Jesus said, I am;" namely, that they might be inexcusable.

   Theophylact: For He knew that they would not believe, nevertheless He
   answered them, lest they should afterwards say, If we had heard any
   thing from Him, we would have believed on Him; but this is their
   condemnation, that they heard and did not believe.

   Augustine, de Con., iii, 6: Matthew, however, does not say that Jesus
   answered, "I am," but, "Thou has said." But Mark shews that the words
   "I am" were equivalent to "Thou hast said."

   There follows: "And ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right
   hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven." [Matt 26:64]

   Theophylact: As if He had said, Ye shall see Me as the Son of Man
   sitting on the right hand of the Father, for He here calls the Father,
   "power". He will not however come without a body, but as He appeared to
   those who crucified Him, so will He appear in the judgment.

   Bede: If therefore to thee, O Jew, O Pagan, and heretic, the contempt,
   weakness, and cross in Christ are a subject of scorn, see how by this
   the Son of Man is to sit at the right hand of the Father, and to come
   in His majesty on the clouds of heaven.

   Pseudo-Jerome: The High Priest indeed asks the Son of God, but Jesus in
   His answer speaks of the Son of Man, that we may by this understand
   that the Son of God is also the Son of Man; and let us not make a
   quaternity (a reference to the charge brought by the Apollinarians
   against the Catholics, that their doctrine of a divine human substance
   in our Lord introduced a fourth Person into the Blessed Trinity; it is
   also answered by St. Ambrose, de Incarnatione, 7, 77 [ed. note?]) in
   the Trinity, but let man be in God and God in man.

   And He said, "Sitting on the right hand of power," that is, reigning in
   life everlasting, and in the Divine power. He says, "And coming with
   the clouds of heaven." He ascended in a cloud, He will come with a
   cloud; that is, He ascended in that body alone, which He took of the
   Virgin, and He will come to judgment with the whole Church, which is
   His body and His fulness.

   Leo, Sermon 5, de Pass.: But Caiaphas, to increase the odiousness of
   what they had heard, "rent his clothes," and without knowing what his
   frantic action meant, by this madness, deprived himself of the honour
   of the priesthood, forgetting that command, by which it is said of the
   High Priest, "He shall not uncover his head or rend his clothes." [Lev
   21:10]

   For there follows: "The High Priest rent his clothes, and saith, What
   need we any further witnesses? Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think
   ye?"

   Theophylact: The High Priest does after the manner of the Jews; for
   whenever any thing intolerable or sad occurred to them, they used to
   rend their clothes. In order then to shew that Christ had spoken great
   and intolerable blasphemy, he rent his clothes.

   Bede: But it was also with a higher mystery, that in the Passion of our
   Lord the Jewish priest rent his own clothes, that is, his ephod, whilst
   the garment of the Lord could not be rent, even by the soldiers, who
   crucified Him. For it was a figure that the Jewish priesthood was to be
   rent on account of the wickedness of the priests themselves. But the
   solid strength of the Church, which is often called the garment of her
   Redeemer, can never be torn asunder.

   Theophylact: The Jewish priesthood was to be rent from the time that
   they condemned Christ as guilty of death.

   Wherefore there follows: "And they all condemned Him to be guilty of
   death."

   Pseudo-Jerome: They condemned Him to be guilty of death, that by His
   guiltiness He might absolve our guilt.

   It goes on: "And some began to spit on Him, and to cover His face, and
   to buffet Him, and to say unto Him, Prophecy: and the servants did
   strike Him with the palms of their hands;" that is, that by being spit
   upon He might wash the face of our soul, and by the covering of His
   face, might take away the veil from our hearts, and by the buffets,
   which were dealt upon His head, might heal the head of mankind, that
   is, Adam, and by the blows, by which He was smitten with the hands, His
   great praise might be testified by the clapping of our hands and by our
   lips, as it is said, "O clap your hands together, all ye people." [Ps
   47:1]

   Bede: By saying, "Prophesy, who is he that smote thee," they mean to
   insult Him, because He wished to be looked upon as a prophet by the
   people.

   Augustine: We must understand by this, that the Lord suffered these
   things till morning, in the house of the High Priest, whither He had
   first been brought.
     __________________________________________________________________

   66. And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the
   maids of the High Priest:

   67. And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and
   said, "And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth."

   68. But he denied, saying, "I know not, neither understand I what thou
   sayest." And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.

   69. And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by,
   "This is one of them."

   70. And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said
   again to Peter, "Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean,
   and thy speech agreeth thereto."

   71. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, "I know not this man of
   whom ye speak."

   72. And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the
   word that Jesus said unto him, "Before the cock crew twice, thou shalt
   deny me thrice." And when he thought thereon, he wept.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Augustine: Concerning the temptation of Peter, which happened during
   the injuries mentioned, all the Evangelists do not speak in the same
   order. For Luke first relates the temptation of Peter, then these
   injuries of the Lord; but John begins to speak of the temptation of
   Peter, and then puts in some things concerning our Lord's
   ill-treatment, and adds, that He was sent from there to Caiaphas the
   High Priest, and then he goes back to unfold the temptation of Peter,
   which he had begun.

   Matthew and Mark, on the other hand, first notice the injuries done to
   Christ, then the temptation of Peter.

   Concerning which it is said, "And as Peter was beneath in the palace,
   there cometh one of the maids of the High Priest."

   Bede: But what can be meant by his being first recognized by a woman,
   when men were more able to know him, if it be not that that sex might
   be seen to sin in the death of our Lord, and that sex be redeemed by
   His Passion?

   It goes on: "But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I
   what thou sayest."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Peter when he had not the Spirit yielded and lost
   courage at the voice of a girl, though with the Spirit he was not
   afraid before princes and kings.

   Theophylact: The Lord allowed this to happen to him by His providence,
   that is, lest he should be too much elated, and at the same time, that
   he might prove himself merciful to sinners, as knowing from himself the
   result of human weakness.

   There follows: "And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew."

   Bede: The other Evangelists do not mention this crowing of the cock;
   they do not however deny the fact, as also some pass over many other
   things in silence, which others relate.

   There follows: "And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that
   stood by, This is one of them."

   Augustine [ed. note: for a harmony of this portion of the Gospel, v.
   Williams on the Passion, p.101]: This maid is not the same, but
   another, as Matthew says. Indeed, we must also understand, that in this
   second denial he was addressed by two persons, that is, by the maid
   whom Matthew and Mark mention, and by another person, of whom Luke
   takes notice.

   It goes on: "And he denied it again."

   Peter had now returned, for John says that he denied Him again standing
   at the fire; wherefore the maid said what has been mentioned above, not
   to him, that is, Peter, but to those who, when he went out, had
   remained, in such a way however that he heard it; wherefore coming back
   and standing again at the fire, he contradicted them, and denied their
   words. For it is evident, if we compare the accounts of all the
   Evangelists on this matter, that Peter did not the second time deny Him
   before the porch, but within the palace at the fire, whilst Matthew and
   Mark who mention his having gone out are silent, for the sake of
   brevity, as to his return.

   Bede: By this denial of Peter we learn, that not only he denied Christ,
   who says that He is not the Christ, but he also, who although he is a
   Christian, denies himself to be such. For the Lord did not say to
   Peter, Thou shalt deny thyself to be my disciple, but, "Thou shalt deny
   me;" he therefore denied Christ, when he said that he was not His
   disciple.

   There follows: "And a little after, they that stood by said again to
   Peter, Surely thou art one of them, for thou art a Galilaean, and thy
   speech agreeth thereto."

   Not that the Galilaeans spoke a different tongue from the inhabitants
   of Jerusalem, for they were both Hebrews, but that each province and
   region has its own peculiarities, and cannot avoid a vernacular
   pronunciation.

   Theophylact: Therefore Peter was seized with fear, and forgetting the
   word of the Lord, which said, "Whosoever shall confess Me before men,
   him will I confess before My Father," [Matt 30:32] he denied our Lord.

   Wherefore there follows: "But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I
   know not this man of whom ye speak."

   Bede: How hurtful it is to speak with the wicked. He denies before
   infidels that he knows the Man, whom amongst the disciples, he had
   confessed to be God. But the Scripture is wont to point out a Sacrament
   of the causes of things, by the state of the time; thus Peter, who
   denied at midnight, repented at cock crew.

   Wherefore it is added: "And the second time the cock crew. And Peter
   called to mind the word which Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crew
   twice, thou shalt deny me thrice."

   Theophylact: For tears brought Peter by penitence to Christ. Confounded
   then be the Novatians, who say that he who sins after receiving baptism
   is not received to the remission of his sin. For behold Peter, who had
   also received the Body and Blood of the Lord, is received by penitence;
   for the failings of saints are written, that if we fall by want of
   caution, we also may be able to run back through their example, and
   hope to be relieved by penitence.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But in a mystical sense, the first maid means the
   wavering, the second, the assent, the third man is the act. This is the
   threefold denial which the remembrance of the word of the Lord washes
   away through tears. The cock then crows for us when some preacher stirs
   up our hearts by repentance to compunction. We then begin to weep, when
   we are set on fire within by the spark of knowledge, and we go forth,
   when we cast out what we were within.

Chapter 15

   1. And straightway in the morning the Chief Priests held a consultation
   with the elders and Scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and
   carried Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate.

   2. And Pilate asked Him, "Art thou the King of the Jews?" And He
   answering said unto him, "Thou sayest it."

   3. And the Chief Priests accused Him of many things: but he answered
   nothing.

   4. And Pilate asked Him again, saying, "Answerest thou nothing? behold
   how many things they witness against thee."

   5. But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede, in Marc., 4, 44: The Jews had a custom of delivering him whom
   they had condemned to death, bound to the judge. Wherefore after the
   condemnation of Christ, the Evangelist adds: "And straightway in the
   morning the Chief Priests held a consultation with the elders and
   Scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried Him away,
   and delivered Him to Pilate." But it must be observed, that they did
   not then first bind Him, but they bound Him on first taking Him in the
   garden by night, as John declares.

   Theophylact: They then gave Jesus up to the Romans, but were themselves
   given up by God into the hands of the Romans, that the Scriptures might
   be fulfilled, which say, "Recompense them after the work of their
   hands." [Ps 28:5]

   It goes on: "And Pilate asked Him, Art thou the King of the Jews?"

   Bede: By Pilate's asking Him about no other accusation, except whether
   He was King of the Jews, they are convicted of impiety, for they could
   not even find a false accusation against our Saviour.

   It goes on: "And He answering said unto him, Thou sayest."

   He answers in this way so as both to speak the truth, and yet not be
   open to cavil.

   Theophylact: For His answer is doubtful, since it may mean, Thou
   sayest, but I say not so.

   Bede: And observe that He does somewhere answer Pilate, who condemned
   Him unwillingly, but does not choose to answer the priests and great
   men, and judges them unworthy of a reply.

   It goes on: "And the Chief Priests accused Him of many things."

   Augustine, de. Con. Evan., iii, 8: Luke has also laid open the false
   charges which they brought against Him; for he thus relates it: "And
   they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the
   nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he
   himself is Christ a King." [Luke 23:2]

   There follows: "And Pilate asked Him, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
   behold how many things they witness against thee."

   Bede: He indeed who condemns Jesus is a heathen, but he refers it to
   the people of the Jews as the cause.

   There follows: "But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate
   marvelled."

   He was unwilling to give an answer, lest He should clear Himself of the
   charge, and be acquitted by the judge, and so the gain resulting from
   the Cross should be done away.

   Theophlyact: But Pilate wondered, because, though He was a teacher of
   the law, and eloquent, and able by His answer to destroy their
   accusations, He did not answer any thing, but rather bore their
   accusations courageously.
     __________________________________________________________________

   6. Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever
   they desired.

   7. And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had
   made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the
   insurrection.

   8. And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had
   ever done unto them.

   9. But Pilate answered them, saying, "Will ye that I release unto you
   the King of the Jews?"

   10. For he knew that the Chief Priests had delivered Him for envy.

   11. But the Chief Priests moved the people, that he should rather
   release Barabbas unto them.

   12. And Pilate answered and said again unto them, "What will ye then
   that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?"

   13. And they cried out again, "Crucify him!"

   14. Then Pilate said unto them, "Why, what evil hath he done?" And they
   cried out the more exceedingly, "Crucify him!"

   15. And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas
   unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged Him, to be
   crucified.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bede: Pilate furnished many opportunities for releasing Jesus, in the
   first place contrasting a robber with the Just One.

   Wherefore it is said: "Now at that feast he released unto them one
   prisoner, whomsoever they desired."

   Gloss: Which indeed he was accustomed to do, to obtain favour with the
   people, and above all, on the feast day, when the people of the whole
   province of the Jews flocked to Jerusalem. And that the wickedness of
   the Jews might appear the greater, the enormity of the sin of the
   robber, whom they preferred to Christ, is next described.

   Wherefore there follows: "And there was one Barabbas, who lay bound
   with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder
   in the insurrection."

   In which words their wickedness is shewn both from the heinousness of
   his signal crime, in that he had committed murder, and from the way in
   which he did it, because he had in doing it raised a sedition and
   disturbed the city, and also because his crime was notorious, for he
   was bound with seditious persons.

   It goes on: "And the multitude," when it had come up, "began to desire
   him to do as he had ever done unto them."

   Augustine: No one can feel it a difficulty that Matthew is silent as to
   their asking some one to be released unto them, which Mark here
   mentions; for it is a thing of no consequence that one should mention a
   thing which another leaves out.

   There follows: "But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I
   release unto you the King of the Jews? For he knew that the Chief
   Priests had delivered Him for envy."

   Some one may ask, which were the words of which Pilate made use, those
   which are related by Matthew, or those which Mark relates; for there
   seems to be a difference between, "Whom will ye that I release unto
   you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?" as Matthew has it;
   and, "Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?" as is here
   said. But since they gave to kings the name of Christs, he who said
   this man or that must have asked whether they wished the King of the
   Jews to be released unto them, that is, Christ. It makes no difference
   to the sense that Mark has said nothing of Barabbas, wishing only to
   mention what belonged to the Lord, since by their answer he
   sufficiently shewed whom they wished to have released to them.

   For there follows: "But the Chief Priests moved the people that he
   should rather release unto them Barabbas."

   Bede: This demand which the Jews made with such toil to themselves
   still sticks to them. Because, when the choice was given to them, they
   chose a robber instead of Christ, a murderer instead of the Saviour,
   they deservedly lost their salvation and their life, and they subjected
   themselves to such a degree to robbery and sedition, that they lost
   their country and their kingdom which they preferred to Christ, and
   never regained their liberty, body or soul.

   Then Pilate gives another opportunity of releasing the Saviour, when
   there follows, "And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will
   ye then that I should do unto the King of the Jews?"

   Augustine: It now is clear enough that Mark means by "King of the Jews"
   what Matthew means by the word, "Christ"; for no kings but those of the
   Jews were called Christs. For in this place according to Matthew it is
   said, "What then shall I do with Jesus which is called Christ?" [Matt
   27:22]

   There follows: "And they cried out again, "Crucify him!"

   Theophylact: Now see the wickedness of the Jews, and the moderation of
   Pilate, though he too was worthy of condemnation for not resisting the
   people. For they cried out, "Crucify"; he faintly tries to save Jesus
   from their determined sentence, and again puts a question to them.

   Wherefore there follows: "Then Pilate said unto them, "Why, what evil
   hath he done?" For he wished in this way to find an opportunity for
   releasing Christ, who was innocent.

   Bede: But the Jews giving loose to their madness do not answer the
   question of the judge. Wherefore it goes on, "And they cried out the
   more exceedingly, Crucify him!," that those words of the Prophet
   Jeremiah might be fulfilled, "Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the
   forest, it crieth out against me." [Jer 12:8]

   There follows: "And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released
   Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged Him, to
   be crucified."

   Theophylact: He wished indeed to satisfy the people, that is, to do
   their will, not what was agreeable to justice and to God.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Here are two goats; one is the scape goat, that is, one
   loosed and sent out into the wilderness of hell with the sin of the
   people; the other is slain, as a lamb, for the sins of those who are
   forgiven. The Lord's portion is always slain; the devil's part, (for he
   is the master of those men, which is the meaning of Barabbas,) when
   freed, is cast headlong into hell.

   Bede: We must understand that Jesus was scourged by no other than
   Pilate himself. For John writes: "Pilate took Jesus, and scourged Him,"
   [John 19:1] which we must suppose that he did, that the Jews might be
   satisfied with Him pains and insults, and cease from thirsting for His
   blood.
     __________________________________________________________________

   16. And the soldiers led Him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and
   they called together the whole band.

   17. And they clothed Him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns,
   and put it about His head.

   18. And began to salute Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"

   19. And they smote Him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon Him,
   and bowing their knees worshipped Him.

   20. And when they had mocked Him, they took off the purple from Him,
   and put His own clothes on Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Theophylact: The vainglory of soldiers, ever rejoicing in disorder and
   in insult, here displayed what properly belonged to them.

   Wherefore it is said, "And the soldiers led Him away into the hall
   called Praetorium, and they call together the whole band," that is, the
   whole company of the soldiers, "and they clothed Him with purple as a
   king."

   Bede: For since He had been called King of the Jews, and the scribes
   and priests had objected to Him as a crime that He usurped rule over
   the Jewish people, they in derision strip Him of His former garments,
   and put on Him a purple robe, which ancient kings used to wear.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., iii, 9: But we must understand that the words
   of Matthew, they "put of Him a scarlet robe," Mark expresses by
   "clothed Him in purple"; for that scarlet robe was used by them in
   derision for the royal purple, and there is a sort of red purple, very
   like scarlet. It may also be that Mark mentions some purple which the
   robe had about it, though it was of a scarlet colour.

   Bede: But instead of the diadem, they put on Him a crown of thorns,
   wherefore it goes on, "And platted a crown of thorns, and put it about
   His head." And for a royal sceptre they give Him a reed, as Matthew
   writes, and they bow before Him as a king, wherefore there follows,
   "And began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!" And that the
   soldiers worshipped Him as one who falsely called Himself God, is clear
   from what is added: "And bowing their knees, worshipped Him," as though
   He pretended to be God.

   Pseudo-Jerome: His shame took away our shame; His bonds made us free;
   by the thorny crown of His head, we have obtained the crown of the
   kingdom; by His wounds we are healed.

   Augustine: It appears that Matthew and Mark here relate things which
   took place previously, not that they happened when Pilate had already
   delivered Him to be crucified. For John says that these things took
   place at Pilate's house; but that which follows, "And when they had
   mocked Him, they took off the purple from Him, and put on Him His own
   clothes," must be understood to have taken place last of all, when He
   was already being led to be crucified.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But in a mystic sense, Jesus was stripped of His
   clothes, that is, of the Jews, and is clothed in a purple robe, that
   is, in the Gentile church, which is gathered together out of the rocks.
   Again, putting it off in the end, as offending, He again is clothed
   with the Jewish purple, [Rom 11:25] for when the fulness of the
   Gentiles is come in, then shall all Israel be saved.

   Bede: Or else, by the purple robe, with which the Lord is clothed, is
   meant His flesh itself, which He gave up to suffering, and by the
   thorny crown which He carried is meant, the taking upon Him of our
   sins.

   Theophylact: Let us also put on the purple and royal robe, because we
   must walk as kings treading on serpents and scorpions, and having sin
   under our feet. For we are called Christians, that is, anointed ones,
   just as kings were then called anointed. Let us also take upon
   ourselves the crown of thorns, that is, let us make haste to be crowned
   with a strict life, with self-denials and purity.

   Bede: But they smite the head of Christ, who deny that He is very God.
   And because men are wont to use a reed to write with, they, as it were,
   smite the head of Christ with a reed, who speak against His divinity,
   and endeavour to confirm their error by the authority of Holy Writ.
   They spit in His face, who spit from them by their accursed words the
   presence of His grace. There are some also in this day, who adore Him,
   with a sure faith, as very God, but by their perverse actions, despise
   His words as though they were fabulous, and think the promises of that
   word inferior to worldly allurements. But just as Caiaphas said, though
   he knew not what it meant, "It is expedient for us that one man should
   die for the people," [John 11:50] so also the soldiers do these things
   in ignorance.

   20. ---- And led Him out to crucify Him.

   21. And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of
   the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear His cross.

   22. And they bring Him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
   interpreted, The place of a skull.

   23. And they gave Him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but He received
   it not.

   24. And when they had crucified Him, they parted His garments, casting
   lots upon them, what every man should take.

   25. And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.

   26. And the superscription of His accusation was written over: The King
   of The Jews.

   27. And with Him they crucify two thieves; the one on His right hand,
   and the other on His left.

   28. And the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, "And he numbered with
   the transgressors." [Isa 53:12]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss: After the condemnation of Christ, and the insults heaped upon
   Him when He was condemned, the Evangelist proceeds to relate His
   crucifixion, saying, "And led Him out to crucify Him."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Here Abel is brought out into the field by his brother,
   to be slain by him. Here Isaac comes forth with the wood, and Abraham
   with the ram caught in the thicket. Here also Joseph with the sheaf of
   which he dreamed, and the long robe steeped in blood. Here is Moses
   with the rod, and the serpent hanging on the wood. Here is the cluster
   of grapes, carried on a staff. Here is Elisha with the piece of wood
   sent to seek for the axe, which had sunk, and which swam to the wood;
   that is, mankind, which by the forbidden tree, fell down to hell, but
   by the wood of the cross of Christ, and by the baptism of water, swims
   to paradise. Here is Jonah out of the wood of the ship sent down into
   the sea and into the whale's belly for three days [ed note: The Glossa
   ordinaria has here preserved the right reading, de ligno navis foris,
   which had been lost both in the editions of St. Jerome and in the
   Catena.].

   There follows: "And they compel Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming
   out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear His
   cross."

   Theophylact: Now John says that He Himself bare His cross, for both
   took place; for He first bore the cross Himself, until some one passed,
   whom they compelled, and who then carried it. But he mentioned the name
   of his sons, to make it more credible and the affirmation stronger, for
   the man still lived to relate all that had happened about the cross.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Now since some men are known by the merits of their
   fathers, and some by those of their sons, this Simon, who was compelled
   to carry the cross, is made known by the merits of his sons, who were
   disciples. By this we are reminded, that in this life, parents are
   assisted by the wisdom and the merits of their children, wherefore the
   Jewish people is always held worthy of being remembered on account of
   the merits of the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles. But this Simon who
   carries the cross, because he is compelled, is the man who labours for
   human praise. For men compel him to work, when the fear and love of God
   could not compel him.

   Bede: Or, since this Simon is not called a man a Jerusalem, but a
   Cyrenian, (for Cyrene is a city in Libya,) fitly is he taken to mean
   the nations of the Gentiles, which were once foreigners and strangers
   to the covenants, but now by obedience are heirs of God, and joint
   heirs with Christ. Whence also Simon is fitly interpreted obedient',
   and Cyrene an heir'. But he is said to come from a country place, for a
   country place is called pagos' in Greek, wherefore those whom we see to
   be aliens from the city of God, we call pagans. Simon then coming out
   from the country carries the cross after Jesus, when the Gentile
   nations leaving pagan rights embrace obediently the footsteps of our
   Lord's Passion.

   There follows: "And they bring Him unto the place Golgotha, which is
   being interpreted, the place of Calvary."

   There are places without the city and the gate, in which the heads of
   condemned persons are cut off, and which receive the name of Calvary,
   that is, of the beheaded. But the Lord was crucified there, that where
   once was the field of the condemned, there the standards of martyrdom
   might be lifted up.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But the Jews relate that in this spot of the mountain
   the ram was sacrificed for Isaac, and there Christ is made bald, that
   is, separated from His flesh, that is, from the carnal Jews.

   There follows: "And they gave Him to drink wine mingled with myrrh."

   Augustine, de. Con. Evan., iii, 11: This we must understand to be what
   Matthew expresses by, "mixed with gall"; for he put gall for anything
   bitter, and wine mingled with myrrh is most bitter; although there may
   have been both gall and myrrh to make the wine most bitter.

   Theophylact: Or, they may have brought different things, in order [ed.
   note. some problem with translation of "in order"], some vinegar and
   gall, and others wine mixed with myrrh.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Or else, "wine mingled with myrrh," that is, vinegar; by
   it the juice of the deadly apple is wiped away.

   Bede: Bitter the vine which bore the bitter wine, set before the Lord
   Jesus, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith, "They gave me
   gall to eat, and when I was thirsty, they gave me vinegar to drink."
   [Ps 69:22]

   Augustine: That which follows, "But He received it not," must mean, He
   received it not to drink, but only tasted it, as Matthew witnesses. And
   what the same Matthew relates, "He would not drink," Mark expresses by,
   "He received it not," but was silent as to His tasting it.

   Pseudo-Jerome: He also refused to take sin for which He suffered,
   wherefore it is said of Him, I then paid the things that I never took.
   [Ps 68:5]

   There follows: "And when they had crucified Him, they parted His
   garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take."

   In this place salvation is figured by the wood; the first wood was that
   of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; the second wood is one of
   unmixed good for us, and is the wood of life. The first hand stretched
   out to the wood caught hold of death; the second found again the life
   which had been lost. By this wood we are carried through a stormy sea
   to the land of the living, for by His cross Christ has taken away our
   torment, and by His death has killed our death.

   With the form of a serpent [ed. note: This clause is not in
   Pseudo-Jerome; its obscurity may be cleared up by comparing it with a
   passage in St. Augustine's sixth sermon, where it is said that the
   serpent signifies death, and that Moses' rod was changed into a serpent
   because our Lord took upon Himself death for us. In St. Gregory Nyasen,
   the serpent is said to signify sin, de vita Mosis, p.193, v. also St.
   Ambrose, de Spiritu Sancto 3, 50.] He kills the serpent, for the
   serpent made out of the rod swallowed up the other serpents. But what
   means the shape itself of the cross, save the four quarters of the
   world; the East shines from the top, the North is on the right, the
   South on the left, the West is firmly fixed under the feet.

   Wherefore the Apostle says: "That we may know what is the height, and
   breadth, and length, and depth." [Eph 3:18]

   Birds, when they fly in the air, take the shape of a cross; a man
   swimming in the waters is borne up by the form of a cross. A ship is
   blown along by its yards, which are in the shape of the cross. The
   letter Tan is written as the sign of salvation and of the cross.

   Bede: Or else, in the transverse beam of the cross, where the hands are
   fixed, the joy of hope is set forth; for by the hands we understand
   good works, by its expansion the joy of him who does them, because
   sadness puts us in straits. By the height to which the head is joined,
   we understand the expectation of reward from the lofty righteousness of
   God; by the length, over which the whole body is stretched, patience,
   wherefore patient men are called long-suffering; by the depth, which is
   fixed in the ground, the hidden Sacrament itself. As long therefore as
   our bodies work here to the destruction of the body of sin, it is the
   time of the cross for us.

   Theophylact: But their casting lots for His garments was also meant as
   an insult, as though they were dividing the clothes of a king; for they
   were coarse and of no great value. And John's Gospel shews this more
   clearly, for the soldiers, though they divided every thing else into
   four parts, according to their number, cast lots for the coat, which
   "was without seam, woven from the top throughout." [John 19:23]

   Pseudo-Jerome: Now the garments of the Lord are His commandments, by
   which His body, that is, the Church is covered; which the soldiers of
   the Gentiles divide amongst themselves, that there may be four classes
   with one faith, the married, and the widowed, those who bear rule, and
   those who are separate. [ed. note: The Catena, Glossa ordinaria, and
   editions of St. Jerome, which often correct each other, here agree in
   the reading "praepositi et separsti." It appears to be only another
   instance of this writer's obscurity.] They cast lots for the undivided
   garment, which is peace and unity.

   It goes on: "And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him."

   Mark has introduced this truly and rightly, for at the sixth hour
   darkness overspread the earth, so that no one could move his head.

   Augustine, de. Con. Evan., iii, 13: If Jesus was given up to the Jews
   to be crucified, when Pilate sat down at his tribunal about the sixth
   hour, as John relates, how could He be crucified at the third hour, as
   many persons have thought from not understanding the words of Mark.
   First then let us see at what hour He might have been crucified, then
   we shall see why Mark said that He was crucified at the third hour. It
   was about the sixth hour when He was given up to be crucified by Pilate
   sitting on his judgment seat, as has been said, for it was not yet
   fully the sixth hour, but about the sixth, that is, the fifth was over,
   and some of the sixth had begun, so that those things which are related
   to the crucifixion of our Lord took place after the finishing of the
   fifth, and at the commencement of the sixth, until, when the sixth was
   completed and He was hanging on the cross, the darkness which is spoken
   of took place.

   Let us now consider, why Mark has said, "It was the third hour." He had
   already said positively, "And when they had crucified Him, they parted
   His garments;" as also the others declare, that when He was crucified
   His garments were divided. Now if Mark had wished to fix the time of
   what was done, it would have been enough to say, "And it was the third
   hour," why did He add, "and they crucified Him," unless it was that he
   wished to point to something which had gone before, and which if
   enquired into would be explained, since that same Scripture was to be
   read at a time, when it was known to the whole Church at what hour our
   Lord was crucified, by which means any error might be taken away, and
   any falsehood be refuted. But because he knew that the Lord was fixed
   to the cross not by the Jews but by the soldiers, as John very plainly
   shews, he wished to intimate that the Jews had crucified Him, since
   they cried out, "Crucify Him," rather than those who executed the
   orders of their chief according to their duty. It is therefore implied,
   that it took place at the third hour when the Jews cried out, "Crucify
   Him," and it is most truly shewn that they crucified Him, when they so
   cried out.

   But in the attempt of Pilate to save the Lord, and the tumultuous
   opposition of the Jews, we understand that a space of two hours was
   consumed, and that the sixth hour had begun, before the end of which,
   those things occurred which are related to have taken place from the
   time when Pilate gave up the Lord, and the darkness overspread the
   earth. Now he who will apply himself to these things, without the
   hard-heartedness of impiety, will see that Mark has fitly placed it at
   the third hour, in the same place as the deed of the soldiers who were
   the executors of it is related.

   Therefore lest any one should transfer in his thoughts so great a crime
   from the Jews to the soldiers, he says "it was the third hour, and they
   crucified Him," that the fault might rather by a careful enquirer be
   charged to them, who, as he would find, had at the third hour cried out
   for His crucifixion, whilst at the same time it would be seen that what
   was done by the soldiers was done at the sixth hour. [ed. note: For
   another explanation of this see Williams on the Passion, p. 257]

   Pseudo-Augustine, Quaest. Vet. et Nov. Test. 65: Therefore he wishes to
   imply that is was the Jews who passed sentence concerning the
   crucifixion of Christ at the third hour; for every condemned person is
   considered as dead, from the moment that sentence is passed upon him.
   Mark therefore shewed that our Saviour was not crucified by the
   sentence of the judge, because it is difficult to prove the innocence
   of a man so condemned.

   Augustine: Still there are not wanting persons who assert that the
   preparation, mentioned by John, "Now it was the preparation about the
   sixth hour," was really the third hour of the day. For they say that on
   that day before the sabbath day, there was a preparation of the
   passover of the Jews, because on that sabbath, they began the
   unleavened bread; but however that the true passover, which is now
   celebrated on the day of our Lord's Passion, that is, the Christian not
   the Jewish passover, began to be prepared, or to have its "parasceue",
   from that sixth hour of the night, when His death began to be prepared
   by the Jews; for "parasceue" means preparation. Between that hour
   therefore of the night and His crucifixion occurs the sixth hour of
   preparation, according to John, and the third hour of the day,
   according to Mark. What Christian would not give in to this solution of
   the question, provided that we could find some circumstance, from which
   we might gather that this preparation of our Passover, that is, of the
   death of Christ, began at the ninth hour of the night? For if we say
   that it began when our Lord was taken by the Jews, it was still early
   in the night, but if when our Lord was carried away to the house of the
   father in law of Caiaphas, where also He was heard by the chief
   priests, the cock had not crowed; but if when He was given up to
   Pilate, it is very plain that it was morning. It remains therefore that
   we must understand the preparation of our Lord's death to have
   commenced when all the Chief Priests pronounced, "He is guilty of
   death." For there is nothing absurd in supposing that was the ninth
   hour of the night, so that we may understand that Peter's denial is put
   out of its order after it really happened.

   It goes on: "And the superscription of His accusation was written over,
   THE KING OF THE JEWS."

   Theophylact: They wrote this superscription, as the reason why He was
   crucified, thus wishing to reprove His vainglory in making Himself a
   king, that so the passers by might not pity Him, but rather hate Him as
   a tyrant.

   Pseudo-Jerome: He wrote it in three languages, in Hebrew, "Melech
   Jeudim"; in Greek, [ ]; in Latin, "Rex confessorum". These three
   languages were consecrated to be the chief, in the superscription on
   the cross, that every tongue might record the treachery of the Jews.

   Bede: But this superscription on the cross shews, that they could not
   even in killing Him take away the kingdom over them from Him who was
   about to render unto them according to their works.

   There follows: "And with Him they crucify two thieves, the one on His
   right hand, the other on His left."

   Theophylact: They did this that men might have a bad opinion of Him, as
   though He also were a robber and a malefactor. But it was done by
   Providence to fulfil the Scriptures.

   There follows: "And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith, And he was
   numbered with the transgressors."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Truth was numbered with the wicked; He left one on His
   left hand, the other He takes on the right, as He will do at the last
   day. With a similar crime they are allotted different paths; one
   precedes Peter into Paradise, the other Judas into hell. A short
   confession won for him a long life, and a blasphemy which soon ended is
   punished with endless pain.

   Bede: Mystically, however, the thieves crucified with Christ signify
   those, who by their faith and confession of Christ undergo either the
   struggle of martyrdom, or some rules of a stricter discipline. But
   those who do these deeds for the sake of endless glory, are signified
   by the faith of the right hand robber; those again who do them for
   worldly praise copy the mind and the acts of the left hand robber.

   Theophylact: Or else; the two robbers were meant to point out the two
   people, that is, the Jews and the Gentiles, for both were evil, the
   Gentile as transgressing natural law, but the Jew by breaking the
   written law, which the Lord had delivered to them; but the Gentile was
   penitent, the Jew a blasphemer unto the end. Between whom our Lord is
   crucified, for He is the corner stone, which binds us together.

   29. And they that passed by railed on Him, wagging their heads, and
   saying, "Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
   days,

   30. Save thyself, and come down from the cross."

   31. Likewise also the Chief Priests mocking said among themselves with
   the Scribes, "He saved others; himself he cannot save."

   32. "Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we
   may see and believe." And they that were crucified with Him reviled
   Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: The foal of Judah has been tied to the vine, and his
   clothes dyed in the blood of the grape, [Gen 49:11] and the kids tear
   the vine, blaspheming Christ, and wagging their heads.

   Wherefore it is said: "And they that passed by railed on Him, wagging
   their heads and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple."

   Theophylact: For the passers by blasphemed Christ, reproaching Him as a
   seducer. But the devil moved them to bid Him come down from the Cross;
   for he knew that salvation was being won by the Cross, therefore he
   again proceeded to tempt Christ, so that if He came down from the
   Cross, he might be certain that He is not truly the Son of God, and so
   the salvation, which is by the Cross, might be done away. But He being
   truly the Son of God, did not come down; for if He ought to have come
   down, He would not have ascended there at all; but since He saw that in
   this way salvation must be effected, He underwent the crucifixion, and
   many other sufferings, unto the finishing of His work.

   It goes on: "Likewise also the Chief Priests mocking said among
   themselves with the Scribes, He saved others, himself he cannot save."

   They said this, to do away with His miracles, as though those which He
   had done were but the semblance of them, for by working miracles He
   saved many.

   Bede: Thus also they confess, though against their will, that He saved
   many. Therefore your words condemn you, for He who saved others could
   have saved Himself.

   It goes on: "Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross,
   that we may see and believe."

   Pseudo-Jerome: Afterwards they saw Him arise from the grave, though
   they would not believe that He could come down from the tree of the
   Cross. Where, O Jews, is your lack of faith? Your own selves I appeal
   to; your own selves I bring as judges. How much more wonderful is it
   that a dead man should arise, than that one yet living should choose to
   come down from the cross. Ye asked but small things, till greater
   should have come to pass; but your want of faith could not be healed by
   signs much greater than those for which you sought. Here "all have gone
   out of the way, all are become abominable." [Ps 13:3]

   Wherefore it goes on: And they that were crucified with Him reviled."

   Augustine, de. Con. Evan. 3, 16: How can this be, when according to
   Luke one only reviled Him, but was rebuked by the other who believed on
   God; unless we understand that Matthew and Mark, who touched but
   slightly on this place, put the plural for the singular number?

   Theophylact: Or else, both at first reviled Him, then one recognizing
   Him as innocent, rebukes the other for blaspheming Him.

   34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi,

   why hast Thou forsaken me?

   35. And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold,
   he calleth Elias."

   36. And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a

   Elias will come to take him down."

   Bede: This most glorious light took away its rays from the world, lest
   it should see the Lord hanging, and lest the blasphemers should have
   the benefit of its light.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And when the sixth hour was come, there was
   darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."

   Augustine, de. Con. Evan. 3, 17: Luke added to this account the cause
   of the darkness, that is, the darkening of the sun.

   Theophylact: If this had been the time for an eclipse, some one might
   have said that this which happened was natural, but it was the
   fourteenth moon, when no eclipse can take place.

   There follows: "And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
   saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani."

   Pseudo-Jerome: At the ninth hour, the tenth piece of money which had
   been lost is found, by the overturning of the house.

   Bede: For when Adam sinned, it is also written that he heard the voice
   of the Lord, walking in paradise, in the cool after mid-day [Gen 3:8];
   and in that hour when the first Adam by sinning brought death into the
   world, in that same hour the second Adam by dying destroyed death. And
   we must observe, that our Lord was crucified, when the sun was going
   away from the center of the world; but at sunrise He celebrated the
   Mysteries of His Resurrection; because He died for our sins, but rose
   again for our justification.

   Nor need you wonder at the lowliness of His words, at the complaints as
   of one forsaken, when you look on the offense of the cross, knowing the
   form of a servant. For as hunger, and thirst, and fatigue were not
   things proper to the Divinity, but bodily afflictions; so His saying,
   "Why hast Thou forsaken me?" was proper to a bodily voice, for the body
   is never naturally wont to wish to be separated from the life which is
   joined to it. For although our Saviour Himself said this, He really
   shewed the weakness of His body; He spoke therefore as man, bearing
   about with Him my feelings, for when placed in danger we fancy that we
   are deserted by God.

   Theophylact: Or, He speaks this as man crucified by God for me, for we
   men have been forsaken by the Father, but He never has. For hear what
   He says; "I am not along, because the Father is with me." [John 16:32]
   Though He may also have said this as being a Jew, according to the
   flesh, as though He had said, Why hast thou forsaken the Jewish people,
   so that they have crucified Thy Son? For as we sometimes say, God has
   put on me, that is, my human nature, so here also we must understand
   "Thou hast forsaken me," to mean my nature, or the Jewish people.

   It goes on: "And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said,
   Behold, he calleth Elias."

   Bede: These however I suppose were Roman soldiers who did not
   understand the peculiarity of the Hebrew tongue, but, from His calling
   Eloi, thought that Elias was called by Him. But if the Jews are
   understood to have said this, they must be supposed to do this, as
   accusing Him of folly in calling for the aid of Elias.

   It goes on: "And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put
   it on a reed, and gave Him to drink, saying, Let along; let us see
   whether Elias will come to take Him down."

   John shews more fully the reason why the vinegar was given to the Lord
   to drink, saying, that Jesus said, "I thirst," [John 19:28] that the
   Scriptures might be fulfilled. They however applied a sponge full of
   vinegar to His mouth.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Here he points out a similitude for the Jews; a sponge
   on a reed, weak, dry, fit for burning; they fill it with vinegar, that
   is, with wickedness and guile.

   Augustine: Matthew has not related, that the man who brought the sponge
   filled with vinegar, but that the others spoke about Elias; from whence
   we gather that both said it.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Though the flesh was weak, yet the heavenly voice, which
   said, "Open me the gates of righteouness," [Ps 117:19] waxed strong.

   Wherefore there follows: "And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave
   up the ghost."

   We who are of the the earth die with a very low voice, or with no voice
   at all; but He who descended from heaven breathed His last with a loud
   voice.

   Theophylact: He who both rules over death and commands it dies with
   power, as its Lord. But what this voice was is declared by Luke:
   "Father, into Thy hands I commend My Spirit." For Christ would have us
   understand by this, that from that time the souls of the saints go up
   into the hands of God. For at first the souls of all were held in hell,
   till He came, who preached the opening of the prison to the captives.

   38. And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the

   39. And when the centurion, which stood over against Him, saw that He

   Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and
   Salome;

   41. (Who also, when He was in Galilee, followed Him, and ministered
   unto Him;) and many other women which came up with Him unto Jerusalem.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss: After the Evangelist has related the Passion and the death of
   Christ, he now goes on to mention those things which followed after the
   death of our Lord.

   Wherefore it is said: "And the veil of the temple was rent in twain
   from the top to the bottom."

   Pseudo-Jerome: The veil of the temple is rent, that is, the heaven is
   opened.

   Theophylact: Again, God by the rending of the veil implied that the
   grace of the Holy Spirit goes away and is rent from the temple, so that
   the Holy of holies might be seen by all; [ed. note: The sense of the
   passage by reference to Theophylact appears to be, that as the Jews
   used to rend their clothes as a sign of grief, so the temple by the
   rending of its veil might be said to mourn.] also that the temple will
   mourn amongst the Jews, when they shall deplore their calamities, and
   rend their clothes.

   This also is a figure of the living temple, that is, the body of
   Christ, in whose Passion His garment is torn, that is, His flesh.

   Again, it means another thing; for the flesh is the veil of our temple,
   that is, of our mind. But the power of the flesh is torn in the Passion
   of Christ, from the top to the bottom, that is, from Adam even down to
   the latest man; for also Adam was made whole by the Passion of Christ,
   and his flesh does not remain under the curse, nor does it deserve
   corruption, but we all are gifted with incorruption.

   "And when the centurion who stood over against Him saw." He who
   commands a hundred soldiers is called a centurion. But seeing that He
   died with such power as the Lord, he wondered and confessed.

   Bede: Now the cause of the centurion's wonder is clear, that seeing
   that the Lord died in that way, that is, sent forth His Spirit, he
   said, "Truly this man was the Son of God." For no one can send forth
   his own spirit, but He who is the Creator of souls.

   Augustine: This also he most of all wondered at, that after that voice
   which He sent forth as a figure of our sin, He immediately gave up His
   Spirit. For the Spirit of the Mediator shewed that no penalty of sin
   could have had power to cause the death of His flesh; for it did not
   leave the flesh unwillingly, but as it willed, for it was joined to the
   Word of God in the unity of person.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But the last are now made the first. The Gentile people
   confesses. The blinded Jew denies, so that their error is worse than
   the first.

   Theophylact: And so the order is inverted, for the Jew kills, and the
   Gentile confesses; the disciples fly, and the women remain.

   For there follows: "There were also women looking on afar off, amongst
   whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of
   Joses, and Salome."

   Origin, in Matt. Tract. 35: But it seems to me, that here three women
   are chiefly named, by Matthew and Mark. Two indeed are set down by each
   Evangelist, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James; the third is
   called by Matthew, the mother of the sons of Zebedee, but by Mark she
   is called Salome.

   Bede: He means by James the Less, the son of Alphaeus, who was also
   called the brother of our Lord, because he was the son of Mary, our
   Lord's mother's sister, whom John mentions, saying, "Now there stood by
   the cross of Jesus His mother and His mother's sister, Mary of
   Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene." [John 19:25]

   And he seems to call her Mary of Cleophas, from her father or some
   relation. But he was called James the Less, to distinguish him from
   James the Great, that is, the son of Zebedee, who was called amongst
   the first of the Apostles by our Lord. Further, it was a Jewish custom,
   nor was it thought blamable after the manners of an ancient people,
   that women should furnish to teachers food and clothing out of their
   substance.

   Wherefore there follows: "Who also when He was in Galilee followed Him,
   and ministered unto Him."

   They ministered unto the Lord of their substance, that He might reap
   their carnal things whose spiritual things they reaped, and that He
   might shew forth a type for all masters, who ought to be content with
   food and clothing from their disciples. But let us see what companions
   He had with Him, for it goes on: "And many other women which came up
   with Him into Jerusalem."

   Pseudo-Jerome: As the female sex through the Virgin Mary is not shut
   out from salvation, so it is not thrust away from the knowledge of the
   Mystery of the Cross, and of the Resurrection, through the widow Mary
   Magdalene, and the others, who were mothers.

   42. And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,
   that is, the day before the sabbath,

   43. Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable counsellor, which also waited
   for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and
   craved the body of Jesus.

   44. And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him
   the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

   45. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

   46. And he brought fine linen, and took Him down, and wrapped Him in
   the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock,
   and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

   47. And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where He was
   laid.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss: After the Passion and Death of Christ, the Evangelist relates
   His burial, saying, "And now when the even was come, because it was the
   preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, Joseph of
   Arimathaea."

   Bede: What is called "parasceue" in Greek, is in Latin "praeparatio";
   by which name those Jews, who lived amongst Greeks, used to call the
   sixth day of the week, because on that day they used to prepare what
   was necessary for the rest of the sabbath day. Because then man was
   made on the sixth day, but on the seventh the Creator rested from all
   His work, fitly was our Saviour crucified on the sixth day, and thus
   fulfilled the mystery of man's restoration.

   But on the sabbath, resting in the tomb, He was waiting for the event
   of the Resurrection, which was to come on the eighth day. So we must
   also in this age of time be crucified to the world; but in the seventh
   day, that is, when a man has paid the debt to death, our bodies indeed
   must rest in the grave, but our souls after good works in hidden peace
   with God; till in the eighth period, even our bodies themselves,
   glorified in the resurrection, receive incorruption together with our
   souls. But the man who buried the body of the Lord must needs by his
   righteous merits have been worthy, and by the nobility of worldly power
   able to perform this service.

   Therefore it is said, "An honourable counsellor, which also waited for
   the kingdom of God." He is called in Latin, "decurio", because he is of
   the order of the "curia", and served the office of a provincial
   magistracy; this officer was also called "curialis", from his care of
   civic duties. Arimathaea is the same as Ramathain, the city of Elkanah
   and Samuel.

   Pseudo-Jerome: It it interpreted, "taking down," of which was Joseph,
   who came to take down the body of Christ from the cross.

   There follows: "Came and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the
   body of Jesus."

   Theophylact: He was bold with a praiseworthy boldness; for he did not
   consider within himself, I shall fall from my rich estate, and I shall
   be expelled by the Jews, if I beg for the body of Him, who was
   condemned as a blasphemer.

   It goes on: "And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead." For he
   thought that He should continue long alive upon the cross, as also the
   thieves used to live long, upon the instrument of their execution.

   It goes on: "And calling unto him the centurion, he asked him if he had
   been any while dead;" that is, before the time when other executed
   persons usually died.

   There follows: "And when he knew it of the centurion, (that is, that He
   was dead,) he gave the body to Joseph."

   Bede: But it was not an obscure person, nor a man of mean rank, who
   could come to the governor and obtain the body.

   There follows: "And he brought fine linen, and took Him down, and
   wrapped Him in the linen."

   Theophylact: Burying the precious body preciously; for being a disciple
   of our Lord, he knew how greatly the Lord's body ought to be honoured.

   Bede: By this however, according to a spiritual meaning, we may
   understand that the body of the Lord should not be wrapped in gold or
   gems, or silk, but in a clean linen cloth. Hence it became a custom in
   the Church that the sacrifice of the altar should not be celebrated in
   silk, or in a dyed cloth, but in linen produced from the earth, just as
   the body of the Lord was wrapped in clean linen; as, we read in the
   Pontifical acts, it was ordered by the blessed Sylvester [ed. note: St.
   Sylvester was Pope from 314 to 335. On his decree respecting the
   Corporal used in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, see Bona de
   Rebns Lit., i.e. 25. 11].

   Though it has also another meaning, that he who receives Jesus in a
   pure mind wraps Him in a clean linen. There follows: "And laid Him in a
   sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the
   door of the sepulchre."

   It is said that the sepulchre of the Lord is a round cell, hewn out of
   the rock which was around it, so high, that a man standing upright
   could scarcely touch the roof with his outstretched hand; and it has an
   entrance to the east, to which the great stone was rolled, and placed
   upon it. In the northern part of it is the tomb itself, that is, the
   place where our Lord's body lay, made of the same rock, seven feet in
   length, raised three palms higher than the floor. It is not open from
   above, but on the south side, the whole of which is open, and through
   which the body was brought in. The colour of the sepulchre and of the
   recess is said to be a mixed white and red.

   Pseudo-Jerome: By the burial of Christ we rise again, by His going down
   into hell we mount up into heaven; here is found the honey in the mouth
   of the dead lion.

   Theophylact: Let us too imitate Joseph, taking to ourselves the body of
   Christ by Unity, and let us place it in a sepulchre, hewn out of the
   rock, that is, in a soul recollected, never forgetful of God; for this
   is a soul hewn out of the rock, that is, out of Christ, for He is our
   rock, who holds together our strength. We ought also to wrap Him in
   linen, that is, to receive Him in a pure body; for the linen is the
   body which is the clothing of the soul. We must, however, not throw
   open, but wrap Him up; for He is secret, closed and hidden.

   There follows: "And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld
   where he was laid."

   Bede: We read in Luke, that His acquaintances and the women who had
   followed Him stood afar off. When these then who were known to Jesus
   returned home after the burial of His body, the women alone, who were
   bound to Him with a closer love, after following the funeral, took care
   to see how He was laid, that they might be able at a fitting season to
   offer Him the sacrifice of their devotion.

   But on the day of the "parasceue", that is, of the preparation, the
   holy women, that is, humble souls, do the same, when they burn with
   love for the Saviour, and diligently follow the steps of His Passion in
   this life, where their future rest is to be prepared; and they weigh
   with a pious minuteness the order in which His Passion was
   accomplished, if perchance they be able to imitate it.

   Pseudo-Jerome: These things also fit the Jewish people, which finally
   is believing, which is ennobled by faith to become the child of
   Abraham. It lays aside its despair, it waits for the kingdom of God, it
   goes in to the Christians, that is may be baptized; which is implied by
   the name of Pilate, which is interpreted.

   One who works with a hammer,' that is, he who subdues the iron nations,
   that he may rule them with a rod of iron. It seeks for the Sacrifice,
   that is, the Viaticum, which is given to penitents at their last end,
   and wraps it up in a heart clean and dead to sin; it makes it firm in
   the safeguard of faith, and shuts it up with the covering of hope,
   through works of charity; (for the end of the commandment is charity;
   [1 Tim 1:5]) whilst the elect, who are the stars of the sea, are
   looking on from afar, for, if it be possible, the very elect shall be
   offended.

Chapter 16

   1. And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother
   of James, and Salome, had brought sweet spices, that they might come
   and anoint Him.

   2. And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came
   unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

   3. And they said among themselves, "Who shall roll us away the stone
   from the door of the sepulchre?"

   4. And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for
   it was very great.

   5. And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the
   right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.

   6. And he saith unto them, "Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
   Nazareth, which was crucified: He is risen; He is not here; behold the
   place where they laid Him."

   7. "But go your way, tell His disciples and Peter that He goeth before
   you into Galilee: there shall ye see Him, and He said unto you."

   8. And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they
   trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for
   they were afraid.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: After the sadness of the sabbath, a happy day dawns upon
   them, which holds the chief place amongst days, for in it the chief
   light shines forth, and the Lord rises in triumph.

   Wherefore it is said: "And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene,
   and Mary the mother of James and Salome, had brought sweet spices."

   Gloss: For these religious women after the burial of the Lord, as long
   as it was lawful to work, that is, up to sunset, prepared ointment, as
   Luke says. And because they could not finish their work from the
   shortness of the time, when the sabbath was over, that is, at sunset,
   as soon as the time for working came round again, they hastened to buy
   spices, as Mark says, that they might go in the morning to anoint the
   body of Jesus. Neither could they come to the sepulchre on the evening
   of the sabbath, for night prevented them.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And very early in the morning the first day of
   the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun."

   Severianus, ap. Chrysologum, sermon 89: The women in this place run
   abroad with womanly devotion, for they do not bring Him faith as though
   He were alive, but ointments as to one dead; and they prepare the
   service of their grief for Him as buried, not the joys of heavenly
   triumph for Him as risen.

   Theophylact: For they do not understand the greatness and dignity of
   the wisdom of Christ. But they came according to the custom of the Jews
   to anoint the body of Christ, that it might remain sweet-smelling, and
   might not burst forth into moisture, for spices have the property of
   drying up, and absorb the moisture of the body, so that they keep the
   body from corruption.

   Greg., Hom. in. Evan., 21: But if we believe on Him who is dead, and
   are filled with the sweet smell of virtue, and seek the Lord with the
   fame of good works, we come to His sepulchre with spices.

   There follows: "And very early in the morning the first day of the
   week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun."

   Augustine, Con. Evang., iii, 24: What Luke expresses by "very early in
   the morning," and John by "early when it was yet dark," Mark must be
   understood to mean, when he says, "very early in the morning, at the
   rising of the sun," that is, when the sky was growing bright in the
   east, as is usual in places near the rising sun; for this is the light
   which we call the dawning. Therefore there is no discrepancy with the
   report which says, "while it was yet dark."

   For when the day is dawning, the remains of darkness lessen in
   proportion as the light grows brighter; and we must not take the words
   "very early in the morning, at the rising of the sun," to mean that the
   sun himself was seen upon the earth, but as expressing the near
   approach of the sun into those parts, that is, when his rising begins
   to light up the sky.

   Pseudo-Jerome: By "very early in the morning," he means what another
   Evangelist expresses by at the dawning [Luke 24:1, dilueulo]. But the
   dawn is the time between the darkness of night, and the brightness of
   day, in which the salvation of man is coming forth with a happy
   closeness, to be declared in the Church, just as the sun, when he is
   rising and the light is near, sends before him the rosy dawn, that with
   prepared eyes she may bear to see the graciousness of his glorious
   brightness, when the time of our Lord's Resurrection has dawned; that
   then the whole Church, after the example of the women, may sing the
   praises of Christ, since He has quickened the race of man after the
   pattern of His Resurrection, since He has given life, and has poured
   upon them the light of belief.

   Bede, in Marc., 4, 40: As then the women shew the great fervency of
   their love, by coming very early in the morning to the sepulchre, as
   the history relates, according to the mystical sense an example is
   given to us, that with a shining face, and shaking off the darkness of
   wickedness, we may be careful to offer the fragrance of good works and
   the sweetness of prayer to the Lord.

   Theophylact: He says, On the first of the sabbaths, that is, on the
   first of the days of the week. For the days of the week are called
   sabbaths, and by the word "una" is meant "prima".

   Bede: Or else, by this phrase is meant the first day from the day of
   sabbaths, or rests, which were kept on the sabbath.

   There follows: "And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away
   the stone from the door of the sepulchre?"

   Severianus, Chrysologus: Your breast was darkened, your eyes shut, and
   therefore ye did not before see the glory of the opened sepulchre.

   It goes on: "And they looked, and saw that the stone was rolled away."

   Bede: Matthew shews clearly enough, that the stone was rolled away by
   an Angel. This rolling away of the stone means mystically the opening
   of the Christian Sacraments, which were held under the veil of the
   letter of the law; for the law was written on stone.

   I goes on: "For it was very great."

   Severianus, Chrysologus: Great indeed by its office rather than its
   size, for it can shut in and throw open the body of the Lord.

   Greg.: But the women who came with spices see the Angels; because those
   minds who come to the Lord with their virtues, through holy desires,
   see the heavenly citizens.

   Wherefore it goes on: "And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a
   young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment;
   and they were affrighted."

   Theophylact: Though Matthew says that the Angel was sitting on stone,
   whilst Mark relates that the women entering into the sepulchre saw a
   young man sitting, yet we need not wonder, for they afterwards saw
   sitting within the sepulchre the same Angel as sat without on the
   stone.

   Augustine: Either let us suppose that Matthew was silent about that
   Angel, whom they saw on entering, whilst Mark said nothing of him, whom
   they say outside sitting on the stone, so that they saw two and heard
   separately from two, the things which the Angels said concerning Jesus;
   or we must understand by "entering into the sepulchre," their coming
   within some inclosure, by which is it probable that the place was
   surrounded a little space before the stone, by the cutting out of which
   the burial place had been made, so that they saw sitting on the right
   hand in that space him whom Matthew designates as sitting on the stone.

   Theophylact: But some say the women mentioned by Matthew were different
   from those in Mark. But Mary Magdalene was with all parties, from her
   burning zeal and ardent love.

   Severianus: The women, then, entered the sepulchre, that being buried
   with Christ, they might rise again from the tomb with Christ. They see
   the young man, that is, they see the time of the Resurrection, for the
   Resurrection has no old age, and the period, in which man knows neither
   birth nor death, admits of no decay, and requires no increase.
   Wherefore what they saw was a young man, not an old man, nor an infant,
   but the age of joy.

   Bede: Now they saw a young man sitting on the right side, that is, on
   the south part of the place where the body was laid. For the body,
   which was lying on its back, and had its head to the west, must have
   had its right to the south.

   Greg.: But what is meant by the left hand, but this present life, and
   what by the right, but everlasting life? Because then our Redeemer had
   already gone through the decay of this present life, fitly did the
   Angel, who had come to announce His everlasting life, sit on the right
   hand.

   Severianus, Chrysologus: Again, they saw a young man sitting on the
   right, because the Resurrection has nothing sinister in it. They also
   see him dressed in a long white robe; that robe is not from mortal
   fleece, but of living virtue, blazing with heavenly light, not of an
   earthly dye, as saith the Prophet, "Thou deckest thyself with light as
   with a garment;" [Ps 104:2] and of the just it is said, "Then shall the
   righteous shine forth as the sun." [Matt 13:43]

   Greg.: Or else, he appeared covered with a white robe, because he
   announced the joys of our festivity, for the whiteness of the robe
   shews the splendour of our solemnity.

   Pseudo-Jerome: The white robe is also true joy, now that the enemy is
   driven away, the kingdom won, the King of Peace sought for and found
   and never let go by us. This young man then shews an image of the
   Resurrection to them who feared death. But their being frightened shews
   that "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the
   heart of man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for them
   that love Him." [1 Cor 2:9]

   There follows: "And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted."

   Greg.: As though he had said, Let them fear, who love not the coming of
   the inhabitants of heaven; let them fear, who, weighed down with carnal
   desires, despair that they can ever attain to their company; but why
   should ye fear, ye who see your own fellow citizens.

   Pseudo-Jerome: For there is no fear in love. Why should they fear, who
   had found Him whom they sought?

   Greg.: But let us hear what the Angel adds; "Ye seek Jesus of
   Nazareth." Jesus means the Saviour, but at that time there may have
   been many a Jesus, not indeed really, but in name, therefore the place
   Nazareth is added, that it might be evident of what Jesus it was
   spoken. And immediately he subjoins the reason, "Which was crucified."

   Theophylact: For he does not blush at the Cross, for in it is the
   salvation of men, and the beginning of the Blessed.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But the bitter root of the Cross has disappeared. The
   flower of life has burst forth with its fruits, that is, He who lay in
   death has risen in glory.

   Wherefore he adds, "He is risen; He is not here."

   Greg.: "He is not here," is spoken of His carnal presence, for He was
   not absent from any place as to the presence of His majesty.

   Theophylact: As if he had said, Do ye wish to be certain of His
   Resurrection, he adds, "Behold the place where they laid Him."

   This too was the reason why he had rolled away the stone, that he might
   shew them the place.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But immortality is shewn to mortals as [debita, ap.
   Pseudo-Hier.] due to thankfulness, that we may understand what we were,
   and that we may know what we are to be.

   There follows: "But go your way, tell His disciples and Peter that He
   goeth before you into Galilee."

   The women are ordered to tell the Apostles, that as by a woman death
   was announced, so also might life rising again. But He says specially
   unto Peter, because he had shewn himself unworthy of being a disciple,
   since he had thrice denied his Master; but past sins cease to hurt us
   when they cease to be pleasing to us.

   Greg.: If again the Angel had not expressly name him who had denied his
   Master, he would not have dared to come amongst the disciples; he is
   therefore called by name, lest he should despair on account of his
   denial.

   Augustine, de. Con. Evan., iii, 25: By saying, "He will go before you
   into Galilee, there shall ye see Him, and He said unto you," he seems
   to imply, that Jesus would not shew Himself to His disciples after His
   Resurrection except in Galilee, which shewing of Himself Mark himself
   has not ['s ec', ap. Aug. (?)] mentioned. For that which He has
   related, "Early the first day of the week He appeared to Mary
   Magdalene," and "after that to two of them as they walked and went into
   the country," we know took place in Jerusalem, on the very day of the
   resurrection; then he comes to His last manifestation, which we know
   was on the Mount of Olives, not far from Jerusalem.

   Mark therefore never relates the fulfilment of that which was foretold
   by the Angel; but Matthew does not mention any place at all, where the
   disciples saw the Lord after He arose, except Galilee, according to the
   Angel's prophecy. But since it is not set down when this happened,
   whether first, before He was seen any where else, and since the very
   place where Matthew says that He went into Galilee to the mountain,
   does not explain the day, or the order of the narration, Matthew does
   not oppose the account of the others, but assists in explaining and
   receiving them.

   But nevertheless, since the Lord was not first to shew Himself there,
   but sent word that He was to be seen in Galilee, where He was seen
   subsequently, it makes every faithful Christian on the look out, to
   find out in what mysterious sense it may be understood.

   Greg.: For Galilee mean a passing over' [transmigratio]; for our
   Redeemer had already passed from His Passion to His Resurrection, from
   death unto life, and we shall have joy in seeing the glory of His
   Resurrection, if only we pass over from vice to the heights of virtue.
   He then who is announced at the tomb, is shewn in passing over,'
   because He who is first known in mortification of the flesh, is seen in
   this passing over of the soul.

   Pseudo-Jerome: This sentence is but short in the number of syllables,
   but the promise is vast in its greatness. Here is the fountain of our
   joy, and the source of everlasting life is prepared. Here all that are
   scattered are brought together, and the contrite hearts are healed.
   There, he says, ye shall see Him, but not as ye have seen Him.

   Augustine: It is also signified that the grace of Christ is about to
   pass over from the people of Israel to the Gentiles, by whom the
   Apostles would never have been received when they preached, if the Lord
   had not gone before them and prepared a way in their hearts; and this
   is what is meant by, "He goeth before you into Galilee, there shall ye
   see Him," that is, there shall ye find His members.

   There follows: "And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre,
   for they trembled and were amazed."

   Theophylact: That is, they trembled because of the vision of Angels,
   and were amazed because of the Resurrection.

   Severianus, Chrysologus: The Angel sits on the sepulchre, the women fly
   from it; he, on account of his heavenly substance, is confident, that
   are troubled because of their earthly frame. He who cannot die, cannot
   fear the tomb, but the women both fear from what was then done, and
   still, as being mortals, fear the sepulchre as mortals are wont.

   Pseudo-Jerome: This also is spoken of the life to come, in which grief
   and groaning will flee away. For the women prefigure before the
   Resurrection all that is to happen to them after the Resurrection,
   namely, they flee away from death and fear.

   There follows: "Neither said they any thing to any man, for they were
   afraid."

   Theophylact: Either on account of the Jews, or else they said nothing
   because the fear of the vision prevented them.

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., iii, 24: We may however enquire how Mark can
   say this, when Matthew says, "they departed quickly from the sepulchre
   with fear and great joy, and did run to bring His disciples word,"
   [Matt 28:8] unless we understand it to mean, that they did not dare to
   say a word to any of the Angels themselves, that is, to answer the
   words which they had spoken to them; or else to the guards whom they
   saw lying there; for that joy of which Matthew speaks is not
   inconsistent with the fear which Mark mentions. For we ought to have
   understood that both feelings were in their minds, even though Matthew
   had not mentioned the fear. But since he has also said that they came
   out with fear and great joy, he does not allow room for any question to
   be raised.

   Severianus, Chrysologus: It is said also in a marked manner, that they
   said nothing to any one, because it is the part of women to hear, and
   not to speak, to learn, not to teach.

   9. Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, He
   appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.

   10. And she went and told them that had been with Him, as they mourned
   and wept.

   11. And they, when they had heard that He was alive, and had been seen
   of her, believed not.

   12. After that He appeared in another form unto two of them, as they
   walked, and went into the country.

   13. And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they
   them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Augustine, de Con. Evan., iii, 25: Now we must consider how the Lord
   appeared after the Resurrection. For Mark says, "Now when Jesus was
   risen early the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary
   Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils."

   Bede: John tells us most fully how and when this appearance took place.
   But the Lord rose in the morning from the sepulchre in which He had
   been laid in the evening, that those words of the Psalm might be
   fulfilled, "Heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the
   morning." [Ps 29:6]

   Theophyact: Or else put a stop at, "Now when Jesus was risen," and then
   read, "early the first day of the week He appeared," &c.

   Greg.: For as Samson at midnight not only left Gaza, but also carried
   away the gates of it, so also our Redeemer rising before the light, did
   not only come out free from hell, but destroyed also the very gates of
   hell.

   [Hom. in Evan., 33] But Mark here testifies that seven devils were cast
   out of Mary; and what is meant by "seven devils" save all vices? for as
   by seven days is understood all time, so by the number seven [see note
   d, p.149] a whole is fitly figured.

   Theophylact: But Mary had seven devils, because she was filled with all
   vices. Or else, by seven devils are meant seven spirits contrary to the
   seven virtues, as a spirit without fear, without wisdom, without
   understanding, and whatsoever else is opposed to the gifts of the Holy
   Ghost.

   Pseudo-Jerome: Again, He is shewn to her, out of whom He had cast seven
   devils, because harlots and publicans shall go before the synagogue
   into the kingdom of heaven, as the thief reached it before the
   Apostles.

   Bede: In the beginning also woman brought man into sin, now she, who
   first tasted death, first sees the Resurrection, lest she should have
   to bear the reproach of perpetual guilt amongst men; and she who had
   been the channel of guilt to man, now has become the first channel of
   grace.

   For it goes on: "And she went and told them that had been with Him as
   they mourned and wept."

   Pseudo-Jerome: They mourn and weep because they had not yet seen, but
   after a short time they shall receive a consolation. For blessed are
   they that weep now, for they shall be comforted.

   Bede: Fitly too is this woman, who was the first to announce the joy of
   our Lord's Resurrection, said to have been cured of seven devils, lest
   any one worthily repenting of his sins should despair of pardon for
   what he had done, and that is might be shewn that "where sin abounded,
   grace did much more abound." [Rom 5:20]

   Severianus, Chrysologus: Mary brings the news, not now as a woman, but
   in the person of the Church, so that, as above woman was silent, here
   as the Church she might bring tidings and speak.

   There follows: "And they when they heard that He was alive and had been
   seen by her, believed not."

   Greg.: That the disciples were slow in believing our Lord's
   Resurrection was not so much a weakness of theirs as it is our
   strength. For the Resurrection itself through their doubts was
   manifested by many proofs; and whilst we read and acknowledge them,
   what do we but become firmer through their doubting?

   There follows: "After this He appeared in another form unto two of them
   as they walked and went to a farm house."

   Augustine: Luke relates the whole story respecting these two, one of
   whom was Cleophas, but Mark here touches but slightly upon it. That
   village of which Luke speaks may without absurdity be supposed to be
   what is here called a farm house, and indeed in some Greek manuscripts
   it is called, the country. But by this name are understood not only
   villages, but also boroughs and country towns, because they are without
   the city, which is the head and mother of all the rest.

   That which Mark expresses by the Lord's appearance "in another form,"
   is what Luke means by saying that "their eye were holden that they
   could not know Him." For something was upon their eyes, which was
   allowed to remain there, until the breaking of bread.

   Severianus, Chrysologus: But let no one suppose that Christ changed the
   form of His face by His Resurrection, but the form is changed when of
   mortal it becomes immortal, so that this means that He gained a
   glorious countenance, not that He lost the substance of His
   countenance. But He was seen of two; because faith in the Resurrection
   is to be preached and shewn to two people, that is, the Gentiles and
   the Jews.

   There follows: "And they went and told it unto the residue, neither
   believed they them."

   How are we to understand the words of Mark compared with the account of
   Luke, that they then said, "The Lord hath risen indeed, and hath
   appeared unto Simon," [Luke 24:34] if we do not suppose that there were
   some there who would not believe?

   Theophylact: For he does not say this of the eleven, but of some
   others, whom He calls the residue.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But in a mystic sense we may understand that faith here
   labours, leading the active life, but there it reigns secure in the
   contemplative vision. Here we see His face through a glass, there we
   shall see the truth face to face, wherefore He was shewn to them as
   they were walking, that is, labouring, in another form. And when it was
   told, the disciples did not believe, because they saw, like Moses, that
   which was not enough for them, for he said, "Shew me Thyself;" [Ex
   33:18] forgetting his flesh, he prays in this life for that which we
   hope for in the life to come.

   14. Afterward He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
   upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
   believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen.

   15. And He said unto them, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the
   Gospel to every creature."

   16. "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
   believed not shall be damned."

   17. "And these signs shall follow them that believe; In My name shall
   they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;"

   18. "They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing,
   it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they
   shall recover."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gloss: Mark, when about to finish his Gospel, relates the last
   appearance of our Lord to His disciples after His Resurrection, saying,
   "For the last time He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat."

   Greg.: We should observe that Luke says in the Acts, "As He was eating
   with them [convescens] He commanded that they should not depart from
   Jerusalem," [Acts 1:4] and shortly afterwards, "while they beheld He
   was taken up." [Acts 1:9] For He ate, and then ascended, that by the
   act of eating, the truth of the flesh might be declared.

   Wherefore it is also here said that "He appeared to them for the last
   time as they sat at meat."

   Pseudo-Jerome: But He appeared when all the eleven were together, that
   all might be witnesses, and relate to all men what they had seen and
   heard in common.

   It goes on: "And upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of
   heart, because they believed not them who had seen Him after His
   Resurrection."

   Augustine: But how was this done "the last time?" The last occasion on
   which the Apostles saw the Lord upon earth happened forty days after
   the Resurrection; but would He then have upbraided them for not
   believing those who had seen Him risen, when they themselves had so
   often seen Him after His Resurrection? It remains therefore that we
   should understand that Mark wished to say it in few words, and said
   "for the last time," because it was the last time that He shewed
   Himself that day, as night was coming on, when the disciples returned
   from the country into Jerusalem, and found, as Luke says, [Luke 24:33]
   the eleven and those who were with them, speaking together concerning
   the Resurrection of our Lord.

   But there were some there who did not believe; when these then were
   sitting at meat, (as Mark says,) and were still speaking, (as Luke
   relates,) "The Lord stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them,
   Peace be unto you;" [Luke 24:36] as Luke and John [John 20:19] say. The
   rebuke therefore which Mark here mentions must have been amongst those
   words, which Luke and John say, that the Lord at that time spoke to the
   disciples. But another question is raised, how Mark says that He
   appeared when the eleven sat at meat, if the time was the first part of
   the night on the Lord's day, when John plainly says that Thomas was not
   with them, who, we believe, had gone out, before the Lord came in to
   them, after those two had returned from the village, and spoken with
   the eleven, as we find in Luke's Gospel. But Luke in his relation
   leaves room for supposing that Thomas went out first, while they spoke
   these things, and that the Lord entered afterwards; Mark however from
   his saying, "for the last time He appeared to the eleven as they sat at
   meat," forces us to believe that he was there, unless indeed, though
   one of them was absent, he chose to call them, the eleven, because the
   company of the Apostles was then called by this number, before Matthias
   was chosen into the place of Judas.

   Or if this be a harsh way of understanding it, let us understand that
   it means that after many appearances, He shewed Himself for the last
   time, that is, on the fortieth day, to the Apostles, as they sat at
   meat, and that since He was about to ascend from them, He rather wished
   on that day to reprove them for not having believed those who had seen
   Him risen before seeing Him themselves, because after His ascension
   even the Gentiles on their preaching were to believe a Gospel, which
   they had not seen.

   And so the same Mark immediately after that rebuke says, "And He said
   unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every
   creature." And lower down, "He that believeth not shall be condemned."
   Since then they were to preach this, were not they themselves to be
   first rebuked, because before they saw the Lord they had not believed
   those to whom He had first appeared?

   Greg.: Another reason also why our Lord rebuked His disciples, when He
   left them as to His bodily presence, was, that the words which He spoke
   on leaving them might remain more deeply impressed upon the hearts of
   His hearers.

   Pseudo-Jerome: But He rebukes their want of faith, that faith might
   take its place; He rebukes the hardness of their stony heart, that the
   fleshy heart, full of love, might take its place.

   Greg.: After rebuking the hardness of their hearts, let us hear the
   words of advice which He speaks. For it goes on: "Go ye into all the
   world, and preach the Gospel to every creature." Every man must be
   understood by "every creature;" for man partakes something of every
   creatures; he has existence as have stones, life as trees, feeling as
   animals, understanding as have Angels. For the Gospel is preached to
   every creature, because He is taught by it, for whose sake all are
   created, whom all things are in some way like, and from whom therefore
   they are not alien.

   By the name of every creature also every nation of the Gentiles may be
   meant. For it had been said before, "Go not into the way of the
   Gentiles." [Matt 10:5] But now it is said, "Preach the Gospel to every
   creature," so that the preaching of the Apostles which was thrust aside
   by Judaea, might be an assistance to us, since Judaea had haughtily
   rejected it, thus witnessing to her own damnation.

   Theophylact: Or else; to every creature, that is, whether believing or
   unbelieving.

   It goes on: "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." For it
   is not enough to believe, for he who believeth and is not baptized, but
   is a catechumen, has not yet attained to perfect salvation.

   Greg.: But perhaps some one may say in himself, I have already
   believed, I shall be saved. He says what is true, if he keeps his faith
   by works; for that is a true faith, which does not contradict by its
   deeds what it says in words.

   There follows: "But he that believeth not shall be damned."

   Bede: What shall we say here about infants, who by reason of their age
   cannot yet believe; for as to older persons there is no question. In
   the Church then of our Saviour, children believe by others, as also
   they drew from others the sins which are remitted to them in baptism.

   It goes on: "And these signs shall follow them that believe; In My name
   shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they
   shall take up serpents."

   Theophlyact: That is, they shall scatter before them serpents, whether
   intellectual or sensible, as it is said, Ye shall tread upon serpents
   and scorpions, [Luke 10:19] which is understood spiritually. But it may
   also mean sensible serpents, as when Paul received no hurt from the
   viper.

   There follows: "And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
   them." We read of many such cases in history, for many persons have
   drank poison unhurt, by guarding themselves with the sign of Christ.

   It goes on: "They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."

   Greg.: Are we then without faith because we cannot do these signs? Nay,
   but these things were necessary in the beginning of the Church, for the
   faith of believers was to be nourished by miracles, that it might
   increase. Thus we also, when we plant groves, strong in the earth; but
   when once they have firmly fixed their roots, we leave off irrigating
   them.

   These signs and miracles have other things which we ought to consider
   more minutely. For Holy Church does every day in spirit what then the
   Apostles did in body; for when her Priests by the grace of exorcism lay
   their hands on believers, and forbid the evil spirits to dwell in their
   minds, what do they, but cast out devils?

   And the faithful who have left earthly words, and whose tongues sound
   forth the Holy Mysteries, speak a new language; they who by their good
   warnings take away evil from the hearts of others, take up serpents;
   and when they are hearing words of pestilent persuasion, without being
   at all drawn aside to evil doing, they drink a deadly thing, but it
   will never hurt them; whenever they see their neighbours growing weak
   in good works, and by their good example strengthen their life, they
   lay their hands on the sick, that they may recover.

   And all these miracles are greater in proportion as they are spiritual,
   and by them souls and not bodies are raised.

   19. So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, He was received up
   into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

   20. And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working
   with them, and confirming the word with signs following.

   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pseudo-Jerome: The Lord Jesus, who had descended from heaven to give
   liberty to our weak nature, Himself also ascended above the heavens;
   wherefore it is said, "So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, He
   was received up into heaven."

   Augustine: By which words He seems to shew clearly enough that the
   foregoing discourse was the last that He spake to them upon earth,
   though it does not appear to bind us down altogether to this opinion.
   For He does not say, After He had thus spoken unto them, wherefore it
   admits of being understood not as if that was the last discourse, but
   that the words which are here used, "After the Lord had spoken unto
   them, He was received into heaven," might belong to all His other
   discourses. But since the arguments which we have used above make us
   rather suppose that this was the last time, therefore we ought to
   believe that after these words, together with those which are recorded
   in the Acts of the Apostles, our Lord ascended into heaven.

   Greg.: We have seen in the Old Testament that Elias was taken up into
   heaven. But the ethereal heaven is one thing, the aerial is another.
   The aerial heaven is nearer the earth, Elias then was raised into the
   aerial heaven, that he might be carried off suddenly into some secret
   region of the earth, there to live in great calmness of body and
   spirit, until he returns at the end of the world, to pay the debt of
   death. We may also observe that Elias mounted up in a chariot, that by
   this they might understand that a mere man requires help from without.
   But our Redeemer, as we read, was not carried up by a chariot, not by
   angels, because He who had made all things was borne over all by His
   own power.

   We must also consider what Mark subjoins, "And sat at the right hand of
   God," since Stephen says, "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man
   standing at the right hand of God." Now sitting is the attitude of a
   judge, standing of one fighting or helping. Therefore Stephen, when
   toiling in the contest, saw Him standing, whom he had for his helper;
   but Mark describes Him as sitting after His assumption into heaven,
   because after the glory of His assumption, He will in the end be seen
   as a judge.

   Augustine, de Symbolic, 7: Let us not therefore understand this sitting
   as though He were placed there in human limbs, as if the Father sat on
   the left, the Son on the right, but by the right hand itself we
   understand the power which He as man received from God, that He should
   come to judge, who first had come to be judged. For by sitting we
   express habitation, as we say of a person, he sat himself down in that
   country for many years; in this way then believe that Christ dwells at
   the right hand of God the Father. For He is blessed and dwells in
   blessedness, which is called the right hand of the Father; for all is
   right hand there, since there is no misery.

   It goes on: "And they went forth and preached every where, the Lord
   working with them, and confirming the word with signs and wonders."

   Bede: Observe that in proportion as Mark began his history later, so he
   makes it reach in writing to more distant times, for he began from the
   commencement of the preaching of the Gospel by John, and he reaches in
   his narrative those times in which the Apostles sowed the same word of
   the Gospel throughout the world.

   Greg.: But what should we consider in these words, if it be not that
   obedience follows the precept and signs follow the obedience? For the
   Lord had commanded them, "Go into all the world preaching the Gospel,"
   and, Ye shall be witnesses even unto the ends of the earth.

   Augustine, Epist., CXCIX [199], 12: But how was this preaching
   fulfilled by the Apostles, [Acts 1:8] since there are many nations in
   which it has just begun, and others in which it has not yet begun to be
   fulfilled? Truly then this precept was not so laid upon the Apostles by
   our Lord, as though they alone to whom He then spoke were to fulfil so
   great a charge; in the same way as He says, "Behold, I am with you
   always, even unto the end of the world," apparently to them alone; but
   who does not understand that the promise is made to the Catholic
   Church, which though some are dying, others are born, shall be here
   unto the end of the world?

   Theophylact: But we must also know from this that words are confirmed
   by deeds as then, in the Apostles, works confirmed their words, for
   signs followed. Grant then, O Christ, that the good words which we
   speak may be confirmed by works and deeds, so that at the last, Thou
   working with us in word and in deed, we may be perfect, for Thine as is
   fitting is the glory both of word and deed.

   Amen.
