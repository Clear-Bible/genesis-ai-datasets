   EDITORS PREFACE

   THE present COMMENTARY, necessarily partaking of the character of the
   Book which it is designed to illustrate, is more historical than
   doctrinal; and hence does not contain so much profound theological
   discussion as some of Calvin's other Commentaries. The leading topic is
   the progress of the Gospel under the inspired teachers to whom its
   first propagation was entrusted, and, in immediate connection with
   this, the Constitution of the Apostolic Church, and the privileges
   enjoyed by its members. To this latter point the attention of the
   religious world is now more especially directed; and whatever be the
   views entertained with regard to it by any reader into whose hands this
   Commentary may fall, if he feels aright, he will not think that his
   study of the controversy is complete until he has made himself
   acquainted with what has been said upon it by such a man as Calvin.

   A work of talent need not be either the less interesting or the less
   instructive that it advocates views at variance with our own. If our
   opinions have been deliberately and candidly formed, it is a
   satisfactory test of their soundness when they continue unshaken by all
   that the ablest opponent can urge against them.

   The Translation appears to be well executed. It is, perhaps, not so
   strictly literal as that of the Commentary on the Romans, which the
   CALVIN SOCIETY has already published; but any difference, in this
   respect, is more than compensated by the general superiority of its
   style. There are occasional obscurities or mistranslations which the
   Editor has endeavored, as in the Commentary on the Romans, to remove by
   foot-notes; but, on the whole, it is believed that the present
   Translation will not suffer by comparison with that of any Theological
   Translation of the same period.

   THE COMMENTARIES
   of M. JOHN CALVIN

   upon the Actes of the Apostles

   Faithfully translated out of Latin into English for the great profit of
   our countrymen, By Christopher Fetherstone
   student in Divinity.

   LONDON,

   Impensis G. Bishop.

   TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORD HENRY,
   EARL OF HUNTINGTON,

   LORD HASTINGS, ETC.,

   Knight Of The Most Honorable Order Of The Garter, And Lord President Of
   The Queen's Majesty's Counsel Established In The North Parts,

   CHRISTOPHER FETHERSTONE WISHETH INCREASE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS, LONG LIFE,
   AND HAPPY DAYS.

   If that (Right Honorable) I should prefix any long and tedious preface
   before this work in commendation of your honor, -- I should of some be
   suspected of flattery; if in praise of these learned Commentaries, --
   it should seem a thing superfluous, seeing they sufficiently commend
   themselves; if in excuse of those faults which are by me in translating
   hereof committed, -- some censuring Cato would condemn me, because I
   would take in hand a work so weighty, being not able to be without
   fault, and by craving pardon for faults laying open my folly. Omitting,
   therefore, those things which might carry with them such
   inconveniences, I hasten unto that whereof I am chiefly to speak;
   namely, to lay open the causes moving me to dedicate this my simple
   translation unto your honor.

   Your deserts of God's church, your singular zeal, your unfeigned faith,
   your sincere profession, your especial care to advance God's glory, and
   to root out Papistry, your faithfulness towards your prince, have been
   such, that this realm generally, but my countrymen in the north parts,
   my native soil, specially, have, and shall have, great cause to praise
   God for you in the day of their visitation, even when it shall please
   God of his great mercy to behold them with favor-able countenance, and
   to take from them in greater measure that blindness and superstition,
   wherein they had been long time nousled, and being fast bred by the
   bone, is not yet (through want of means) gotten out of the flesh.
   Seeing all these virtues are in you to be found; seeing both this
   church and country have found you so beneficial, whom ought not these
   things to provoke to show all thankfulness towards your honor?

   Again, when this history of the Acts of the Apostles was first penned
   in Greek by Luke, it was dedicated to noble Theophilus. When M. Calvin
   did the second time publish his Commentaries thereupon in Latin, he
   presented them unto one who was in mind a noble Theophilus. Lest,
   therefore, this work, now published in English, should by dedication be
   any whit debased, I have made choice of your honor, being no less a
   noble Theophilus than those before mentioned.

   Another thing, which is not so much a cause as an encouragement, is
   that courtesy which your honor showeth to those which present unto you
   any exercises of learning, how simple soever they be, whereof I have
   had full good experience even in my tender years; namely, at such time
   as I was trained up in the city of Carlisle, under that man, in his
   calling painful, and to the commonwealth profitable, M. Hayes, whom for
   that duty which to him I owe I name. At which time, though those
   exercises which unto your honor we then presented were simple, yet were
   they so courteously of you received, that the remembrance thereof doth
   even now encourage me to presume to offer unto you some weightier
   matter.

   The last, but not the least, is, the consideration of that great and
   undeserved kindness, which all my friends in general, but especially my
   brother, your honor's servant, have found at your hands, which, to rip
   up at large, would be too tedious. In their behalf, therefore, Right
   Honorable, as also in mine own, as a small testimony of a thankful
   heart, I present unto your honor this work; simple, if you respect the
   translation, but most excellent, if you consider the matter. And thus,
   humbly craving pardon for my boldness, and much more humbly beseeching
   the Lord to bless you in the reading hereof, I conclude, fearing
   prolixity. The Lord of heaven bless you, and grant that: as you have
   been heretofore a good Theophilus, so you may continue to the glory of
   God, the increasing of his Church, and the profit of this commonwealth.

   From Maighfield in Sussex, this 12th of October, 1585.

   Your Honor's most humble and obedient,
   and in Christ at commandment,

   CHRISTOPHER FETHERSTONE.

   THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.

   THOU hast at length, (Christian reader,) through the blessing of God,
   wherewith he hath blessed my labors, those learned Commentaries of M.
   Calvin upon the Acts of the Apostles, though simply, yet faithfully,
   turned into English; and though of many I was the unmeetest to attempt
   this travail, yet such was the earnest request of my godly friends,
   that unless I should have taken it in hand, I should have seemed void
   of courtesy, and also of care to profit God's Church. I will not stand
   to rip up those commodities which thou by reading these Commentaries
   mayest reap, but I leave them to thine own experience. What my travail
   hath been in this work, those who have endured like toll can best
   judge. And forasmuch as I know well, that after great painstaking some
   things have escaped me, I beseech thee, (gentle reader,) condemn me not
   rashly, but rather amend them friendly. If thou shalt grow forward in
   knowledge by reading this work, then praise God, who hath by this means
   made thee profit. God give thee good success in reading, that thereby
   thou mayest both be better learned, and also better lived.

   Thine in the Lord,
   CHRISTOPHER FETHERSTONE.

   TO THE MOST RENOWNED PRINCE, THE LORD NICOLAS RADZIWILL, DUKE IN OLIKA,

   COUNTY PALATINE OF VILNA, CHIEF MARSHAL, AND HEAD CHANCELLOR OF THE
   GREAT DUKEDOM OF LITHUANIA, ETC.,

   HIS LORD HIGHLY TO BE REVERENCED,
   JOHN CALVIN.

   WHEREAS I have made mention of the names of those kings unto whom I had
   dedicated these my Commentaries, lest the change incur the crime of
   lightness among certain unskillful men, I must briefly render some
   reason thereof. For although both the remembrance of the father, who is
   dead, doth retain that reverence with me which it deserveth, and I do
   also, as becometh me, reverence the son; yet the importunities of
   certain did enforce me to put out [1] their names in this second
   edition, who, being incensed against me with a furious hatred and fear,
   lest the majesty of kings do purchase some favor to my writings, do
   boast abroad that they did conceive sore displeasure, that their name
   was mixed with the doctrine of the sacraments which they themselves
   disallow. I leave it indifferent whether that be true or no, neither do
   I pass; [2] forasmuch as I did neither hunt after any private gain, nor
   yet seek to win favor. But because it seemed to me an indecent and
   filthy thing to enforce those books upon men which are unwilling to
   entertain them, which do find willing readers enough, it was worth the
   declaring now, that I never did think any thing less; but that I did
   hope for more courtesy than I found. In that truly there can be no
   offense, if withdrawing myself from the contempt of those who loathe my
   dutifulness, I suffer them to enjoy those delights of theirs which they
   desire, and wherein they delight.

   Of you, most famous prince, have I made choice, not without good cause,
   whom I might put in the place of two; both because I think you most
   worthy to have your name appear in the spiritual building of Christ's
   temple; neither do I fear but that my book shall find the same
   friendship at your hands, which you did vouchsafe to declare towards me
   in your most gentle letters. But, omitting at this time the respect of
   private good-will, I will stay in another thing. Moreover, I may full
   well apply unto you that speech which I had before with another.
   Neither am I determined in this place to commend those most excellent
   virtues wherewith you have purchased great authority and singular favor
   with the King [3] of Polonia; I am rather bent unto an exhortation, the
   sum whereof shall be this, that with the like readiness and joyfulness
   wherewith you have at the beginning received the pure doctrine of the
   Gospel, that with the like stoutness of courage wherewith you have
   hitherto endeavored to maintain the true worship of God, you do with
   the same constancy prosecute this course unto the end.

   It was surely a point of rare virtue, that whereas you did know that
   many did hate nothing more than the frank profession and free study of
   godliness, yet, so soon as the truth of the Gospel of Christ did once
   shine and appear unto you, you did not fear by giving your name to
   provoke their hatred against you. Neither do those offices and good
   turns deserve small praise, which you did not cease to bestow upon the
   cherishing and increasing of the first beginnings of the Church;
   although this your diligence did purchase unto you great envy amongst
   many noblemen, which did not allow the same. But, because you have no
   less hard straits to pass through, you must oftentimes stir up and
   encourage yourself to overcome them all, until you have finished the
   last act; and, so much the more carefully, because many princes,
   although they see the estate of the Church filthily corrupt, yet dare
   they attempt no remedy; because that danger which they fear will
   proceed from innovation, when evils must be driven out of their old and
   quiet possession, doth hinder and keep them back from doing their duty.
   Other some think it to be an absurd and foolish thing to touch (or set
   hand to) diseases which are incurable. Other some (I cannot tell
   through what forwardness) do flee from and abhor all manner of
   reformation. But to intreat of those lets wherewith you are environed
   on every side, it were superfluous, especially seeing you know them
   well enough. Yet, howsoever Satan doth assault you, and with what
   combats soever he doth exercise you, you cannot, without great
   wickedness, be weary of this holy warfare, which you have professed
   under Christ his banner. Furthermore, although you be forward enough of
   yourself, yet I hope it will neither be troublesome, nor yet
   unprofitable for you, to have your prosperous course of your earnest
   study, holpen and furthered with this help which God doth offer unto
   your hands by me. [4]

   So often as we see things tossed to and fro, and, as it were, turned
   topsy-turvy in the world, there can no more fit and sure prop be found
   to establish and stay our weak consciences, than when as setting before
   our eyes the kingdom of Christ, as it doth now appear, we consider what
   hath been [5] the estate and condition of the same from the beginning.
   When we speak of the kingdom of Christ, we must respect two things; the
   doctrine of the gospel, whereby Christ doth gather unto himself a
   church, and whereby he governeth the same, being gathered together;
   secondly, the society of the godly, who being coupled together by the
   sincere faith of the gospel, are truly accounted the people of God.
   Both which things, how lively they are expressed by Luke, in the Acts
   of the Apostles, it is better to know by the reading of the whole book,
   than to believe either my commendation, or the commendation of any man
   else. For although the Son of God hath always reigned, even from the
   first beginning of the world, yet after that, being revealed in the
   flesh, he published his gospel, he began then to erect a more famous
   tribunal-seat than before, whence he doth now appear most plainly, and
   to be also most glorious. If we turn our eyes hither, they shall be
   fed, not with a vain picture, (as Virgil saith of his AEneas) but with
   the sound knowledge of those things from which we must fetch life. And
   to the end I may return unto that whereof I determined to speak, this
   is the best refuge for the conscience of men, where they may quietly
   rest amidst these troublesome tempests wherewith the world is shaken.
   Finally, this meditation alone shall bring to pass, that that shall
   never befall us, which too too many experiments do prove to have been
   truly spoken by Ennius in times past of the more part of men, that
   wisdom is driven away so often as the matter is handled by violence.
   For if, in the greatest and most vehement heat of combats, the sweet
   harmony of instruments was of such force amongst the Lacedemonians,
   that it did assuage that furiousness and fierceness which was
   engendered in that warlike people, and did temper that violence which
   doth then out of measure rage in those natures which are otherwise
   impatient, how much more shall the kingdom of Christ do this by the
   heavenly pleasant tune of the Holy Ghost, which doth not only tame most
   cruel beasts, but maketh also lambs of wolves, lions, and bears; which
   turneth spears into hooks, and swords into ploughshares?

   Therefore, seeing that, most noble prince, I offer unto you such kind
   of temperature as the necessity of times requireth, I hope that this
   duty of mine shall not be unwelcome to your highness; so that, indeed,
   you shall perceive this kind of confirmation to be very profitable and
   fit to look into the beginning of the Church, as it is described of
   Luke, wherein appeareth both wonderful power of God under the reproach
   of the cross, and also most valiant patience of the servants of God,
   under the huge burden of troubles, and the success itself incredible to
   the judgment of the world, bringeth forth most plentiful fruit of both.
   But that I may omit other things which you had better set [seek] out by
   reading of Luke himself, I will touch one thing which is proper to
   earthly princes, and the chief governors of kingdoms and countries; to
   wit, that seeing that (the power of the whole world gainsaying, and all
   men which were then in authority being armed to oppress the gospel) a
   few men, obscure, unarmed, and contemptible, trusting only to the aid
   of the truth and the Spirit, did labor so stoutly in spreading abroad
   the faith of Christ, did refuse no pains nor danger, did stand stoutly
   against all assaults, until at length they got the victory; there
   remaineth no excuse for Christian nobles, who are of any dignity,
   seeing God hath furnished them with the sword to defend the kingdom of
   his Son, unless they be at least as constant and bold to take upon them
   such an honorable office.

   Furthermore, it is not my part to declare how faithfully and uprightly
   I have behaved myself in interpreting this history. I hope, surely, my
   labor shall be fruitful to all men. And as for you, most worthy prince,
   I must again request and beseech you, that you do both privately addict
   yourself wholly unto Christ his government, as you have of late happily
   begun; and that you would also become not only a faithful helper, but
   also a most stout and valiant standard-bearer in furthering the kingdom
   of Christ unto so many noble men, whom not only the renown of their
   stock and lineage, but also the excellency of their virtues, doth
   commend. God hath vouchsafed to bestow upon the realm of Polonia a
   singular privilege of honor, that the better part of the nobility,
   bidding adieu to wicked superstitions, which are as many corruptions
   and pollutions of the worship of God, should desire with one consent a
   true form of godliness, and a well framed and reformed order of the
   Church. It is well known that these men were not a little aided by your
   authority. But there remain more combats both for you and also for
   them, than that, like overworn [6] soldiers, you should give yourselves
   to idleness and rest.

   First, although no foreign enemy trouble you, you shall have business
   enough to withstand those evils which are at home with you. You have
   sufficiently tried with how many sleights Satan is furnished, that he
   may work some policy to overthrow that holy concord amongst brethren,
   wherein consisteth the safety of the Church; that befalleth you which
   is common everywhere, for troublesome men to thrust in themselves when
   things are out of order; who, whilst they see a few, and those
   weaklings troubled by a great multitude, and that they do with much ado
   defend the truth, which is covered with the thick clouds of false
   accusations, they do more easily come upon them unawares [7] And by
   this subtlety doth that chief worker of all deceit and guile seek the
   ruin of the Church, not only by cutting, mangling, and pulling in
   pieces the unity of the faith, but by burdening the name of Christ with
   false envy; because the companies of the godly, amongst whom these
   wicked knaves mix themselves, seem to be certain receptacles and sinks
   of all filthiness.

   So, whilst that Stancarus, a man of a troublesome nature, doth, through
   that ambition wherewith he is wholly set on fire, spread abroad amongst
   you his dotings, hereupon brake out that contention which threateneth
   some scattering abroad; and you were laid open unto the slanders of
   many, because it was thought that his sect did spread itself farther.
   Behold, on the other side, a certain physician, called George
   Blandrata, worse than Stancarus, because his error is more detestable,
   and because he hath in his mind more secret poison. For which cause
   these also are the more worthy to be reproved, at whose hands the
   ungodliness of Servetus hath found such favor of such a sudden. For
   although I am persuaded that they are far from those perverse and
   sacrilegious opinions, yet they should have taken better heed, and not
   have suffered this fox craftily to creep into their company. Because
   such plagues will never be wanting, neither will Satan ever cease to
   bring abroad into the forefront such champions as have given over
   themselves to serve him, that he may trouble the beginnings of the
   gospel, it is for you to be continually in a readiness; and to the end
   you may prevent greater evils, you must set down right and godly manner
   of government, which is the faithful keeping of holy peace. For as it
   is manifest that purity of doctrine is the soul of the Church, so we
   may full well compare discipline unto the sinews, wherewith the body
   being bound and knit together, doth maintain his [its] strength.

   Now, on the other side, the ungodliness of other enemies ought to
   sharpen your study (and earnestness,) I mean the preachers of
   Antichrist of Rome, who, to the end they may deceive the ignorant, do
   continually, with shrill voice, sound out the name of the Church. There
   is no controversy amongst us about the Church, but all grant that the
   authority thereof ought to be reverenced of all the children of God;
   save only that they, under false color of honor, do make the shadowish
   name of the Church subject to their lusts; we do so reverence the
   Church from our heart, that we account it great wickedness to profane
   the sacred name thereof. That I may omit other godly ministers of pure
   and sound doctrine, I myself have again and again heretofore in many
   places handled this question. When mention is made of the Church, whose
   head is the Son of God, and which he, who is the fountain of life
   eternal, doth always quicken by his Spirit, how ridiculous a thing it
   is to bring forth a body without a head, and, secondly, a dead carcass.

   The hireling flatterers of the Pope do cry out that they have the
   Church; but we can know by no means better, whether this be true or no,
   than when we look unto the head. As for that, it is manifest that it is
   cut off by their sacrilegious violence. For how shall Christ retain the
   place of the head, being despoiled of all his power, thrown down from
   his government, deprived of his dignity? Upon this condition hath the
   heavenly Father made him the head of the Church, that he may govern all
   men from the greatest to the least, by the doctrine of his gospel; that
   he may be the only priest to reconcile the Father continually, as he
   hath once appeased his wrath by the sacrifice of his death; that his
   death may continually purge our sins; that his blood may be the only
   washing; that his obedience may be a perfect satisfaction; that he may
   be a (continual and) sole intercessor, through whose means our prayers
   may be heard; that he may be a faithful defender and tutor, that he
   may, by his aid, defend us; that (the vices of our flesh being tamed)
   he may reform us unto righteousness and holiness; that he alone may
   begin and finish in us a blessed life. If the Papists have left him any
   of these things, let them have the Church on their side. But if the
   Pope, oppressing men's consciences with his fierce and more cruel
   tyranny, have disannulled and taken away Christ his government; if he
   have brought in a form of government altogether contrary to the gospel;
   if he have invented a new and strange priesthood, that he may thrust-in
   himself, being but a mortal man, to be the mediator between God and the
   world; if he have forged daily sacrifices, that he may trot them in
   Christ's place; if he have invented a thousand satisfactions for sins;
   if he have brought reigned washings from the lake of hell, to make dry
   the blood of the Son of God; if he have put in his place infinite
   patrons; if he have torn in a thousand pieces that righteousness which
   must be set [sought] wholly from him; if, instead of the Holy Ghost, he
   have erected man's free-will; it is, without all question, that the
   true Christ is banished far from Papistry. For this cause have I said
   that the Papists make boast of a dead carcass instead of the lively
   body of Christ, because, though they have extinguished the doctrine of
   the gospel, (which is the true soul of the Church, and which duly doth
   quicken the same,) yet they do greatly boast of a shadowish and
   trifling kind of Church.

   We make it full well known how corrupt the purity of doctrine is
   amongst them, yea, with what monstrous errors it is polluted. They do
   not only cover all their corruptions under the shadow of the Church,
   but also complain that we do great injury to the Church, because we say
   that the same doth err. But they should first have examined the
   doctrine, that the Church might thereby be known. These just and honest
   judges will have the reigned title of doctrine to have sufficient force
   of prejudice to cover and suppress the difference, and that not to
   deceive men. For with what sleights and legerdemain would they assay to
   blear even dazzling eyes in so great light? But because they account
   this liberty of lying a part of their tyranny, they think they reign
   not as they would, unless they reproachfully mock miserable souls.

   That we may set an example no farther, we have seen in our times,
   sometimes the Tridentine Fathers, sometimes the Fathers of Bononia,
   who, although they were even at daggers drawing among themselves, yet
   did they foam out their vain canons on both sides. And surely if men
   assent to their principles, the triumph shall be prepared on both
   sides. There sit there I cannot tell how many bishops and abbots,
   peradventure an hundred horned beasts. If the most fine flower of all
   the nation should shine there, yet should it be nothing else but a
   wicked conspiracy against God. And now after that the Pope hath
   gathered together the bran and chips of his unclean and filthy rotten
   flock, shall the representative Church suddenly appear there? And are
   they not yet ashamed to call that an holy, general, and lawful Council,
   which doth not deserve so much as to be called a vain and comical visor
   of a Council? But as for us, to whom the promise is made, that
   Antichrist, who sitteth in the temple of God, shall be destroyed with
   the breath of the Lord's mouth; let not us (I say) cease to refute this
   filthy and whorish impudency, with that most sacred word which they so
   boldly mock, that all men may see what difference there is between the
   chaste spouse of Christ and the stinking whore of Belial; between the
   sanctuary of God and the brothel-house of Satan; between the spiritual
   house of the godly and the stye of hogs; and, finally, between the true
   Church and the court of Rome. There can no more certain or plain
   demonstration be brought concerning this matter either by Euclid,
   either yet by Archimedes, than if the Church, as Luke describeth it, be
   compared with the Popish synagogue. Neither am I so strait that I would
   have that confused lump, being altogether repugnant unto the order of
   nature and manner of humanity, to be agreeable in all points to the
   rule of the Apostles, which is angelical and heavenly. If they can show
   any thing wherein they are like unto them, [8] they may triumph for me;
   but forasmuch as all things are contrary, and although the more part of
   men become blind willingly, at least wise, [still] seeing the whole
   heavens do allow [9] us, we may not only contemn their brain-sick pride
   without any fear, but also freely speak evil of the same.

   In the mean season, we have no small consolation to support us, that
   howsoever the Papists do set against us with stern countenance [10] the
   name and title of the Church, yet we know that we fight only against
   the professed enemies of Christ. We ought above all things to desire,
   that the most renowned king, who, according to his wisdom, hath long
   ago spied out the subtle sleights of the Romish court, commanding those
   vain bulls to avoid, [11] wherein the council boasteth afar off, may at
   length more freely apply his mind unto the earnest and perfect
   restoring of the Church; yet ought no lingering to keep you back, but
   every one of you must, with might and main, endeavor to enlarge and
   spread abroad those beginnings which are begun to arise so happily.

   Farewell, most excellent lord and right renowned prince. The Lord
   always govern you with his Spirit, amplify by all means your dignity,
   and bless your godly enterprises even unto the end.

   At Geneva, the 1st of August, 1560.

   THE ARGUMENT

   UPON

   THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.

   To the intent that all godly men may, with more diligence, read this
   history, and also be more desirous thereof, it shall not be without
   profit briefly to note what commodity they shall reap thereby.

   This is the chiefest praise that a profane history hath, namely, that
   it is the mistress of life. If that narration of famous deeds, which
   only teacheth men what they ought to follow, or what they ought to
   eschew, in their common actions, deserve such a title, of how great
   praise are the divine histories worthy, which do not only frame the
   outward life of man that he may win praise by virtue, but also (which
   is more) which declare unto us that God, from the beginning, hath had a
   special regard always of his Church, (and faithful congregation,) that
   he hath been always a most just revenger of all wrongs done unto those
   that have betaken themselves unto his tuition, and have committed
   themselves unto his custody; that he hath showed himself favorable and
   merciful unto most miserable and wretched sinners; and, lastly, by
   teaching us faith, raised us high above the heavens. I say nothing of
   this, that they do everywhere set forth the providence of God, that
   they distinguish the true worship of God from the false, and never err
   in the difference of vice and virtue; although I omit now also those
   worthy praises which used most commonly to be attributed unto the
   sacred histories, intending only shortly to touch those which are
   proper to this book which we have taken in hand.

   Those things which Luke setteth before us in this place to be learned
   are not only great, but also of rare profit; for, first, in that he
   showeth that the Spirit of God was sent unto the apostles, he doth not
   only prove that Christ was faithful (and true) in keeping his promise
   made unto his apostles; but also he certifieth us, that he is always
   mindful of his, and a perpetual governor of his Church, because the
   Holy Spirit did descend from heaven to this end; whereby we learn that
   the distance of place doth no whit hinder Christ from being present
   with those that be his at all times. Now, here is most lively painted
   out the beginning of Christ's kingdom, and as it were the renewing of
   the world; for although the Son of God had gathered together, by his
   preaching, a certain Church, before such time as he departed out of the
   world, yet, nevertheless, that was the best form of the Church which
   began then, when as the apostles, having new power given them from
   above, began to preach that that only Shepherd did both die and also
   rise again, that through his conduct all those which were dispersed,
   far and wide, (upon the face of the whole earth,) might be gathered
   unto one sheepfold. Here is, therefore, set down both the beginning and
   also the increasing of the Church of Christ after his ascension,
   whereby he was declared to be King both of heaven and earth.

   Furthermore, therein appeareth, as well the marvelous power of Christ,
   as the great force and efficacy of the gospel itself; for in that
   Christ, by a sort of simple souls, (and of no reputation amongst men,)
   being indued also with no eloquence at all, hath subdued the whole
   world so easily, by the only voice of the gospel, whereas,
   notwithstanding Satan did resist him with so many lets, he hath showed
   a most manifest token of his divine power and might therein. And also,
   we see in the same the incredible force of the gospel, that it did not
   only come forth and show itself, although the whole world did say nay,
   but also with great glory and majesty, make all that which did seem
   stubborn to be obedient unto Christ. Therefore, these few and simple
   creatures did more prevail against the troublesome tumults of the
   world, with the base and simple sound of their mouth, than if God
   should openly have thrown down lightnings [12] from heaven. And, on the
   other side, the Spirit of God teacheth us, that the kingdom of Christ
   beginneth never sooner to flourish, but by and by Satan opposeth
   himself most furiously against the same, and useth all his engines
   either utterly to overthrow or sore to shake the same. Neither are we
   only taught, that Satan doth resist Christ as an enemy, but also that
   the whole world doth furiously rage together against him, that he may
   not reign over them. Yea, furthermore, that is to be set down as a
   thing most certain, that wicked men, whilst they do so rage against the
   gospel, do both fight under Satan's banner, and are pricked forward by
   him into so blind fury. Hereupon do arise so many uproars, so many
   plaguy conspiracies, so many devilish endeavors of the reprobate to
   overthrow the gospel, (and to hinder the free passage of the same,)
   which Luke setteth down almost in every place.

   Lastly, like as the apostles have indeed tried, [13] that the doctrine
   of the gospel is a fire and a sword, so may we learn by their
   experience that it will always come to pass, not only by the obstinate
   malice of Satan, but also by the fatal stubbornness of men, that the
   gospel shall suffer many conflicts, and that thereby many tumults shall
   be raised. But, on the other side, he declareth that the apostles,
   (with a stout stomach,) with a lively courage and invincible
   violentness [force] of mind, did, notwithstanding, execute the office
   which they knew was enjoined them by God; and also, what innumerable
   troubles they suffered with great perseverance, what wearisomeness they
   passed over, how patiently they sustained most cruel persecution; and,
   lastly, how meekly they suffered reproach, sorrow, and calamity of all
   sorts. And we must learn patience by such examples, seeing the Son of
   God hath pronounced that the cross and tribulation shall always
   accompany his gospel; we must not pamper and cherish ourselves with a
   vain hope, as though the state and condition of the Church should be
   quiet (prosperous) and flourishing here upon earth. Let us, therefore,
   address ourselves to suffer the like things. And that is added as no
   small comfort for us, that as God hath marvelously delivered his Church
   in times past, being afflicted and oppressed so many ways, so he will
   at this day be present with us also. For, surely, seeing that in this
   book is declared how that God, by his mighty hand and outstretched arm
   alone, doth continually defend his Church, being amidst continual
   deaths: God himself, by this means, setteth before our eyes his
   continual providence in procuring the safety thereof.

   Furthermore, here are set down certain sermons of the apostles which
   intreat in such sort of the great mercies of God, of the grace of
   Christ, of the hope of blessed immortality, of the calling upon God, of
   repentance and the fear of God, and also of other principal points of
   Christian doctrine, that we need not seek the whole sum of godliness
   anywhere else.: But that I may now omit the declaration of sound and
   pure doctrine, -- if that be a thing most needful to be known, namely,
   to understand how the Church of Christ first began; how the apostles
   began to preach the gospel; what success they had in the same; what
   cruel combats they suffered; how manfully they passed through so many
   lets and impediments; how courageously they triumphed over all the
   pride of the world under the reproach of the cross; how wonderfully God
   was present with them: then must we highly esteem of this book, which,
   unless it were extant, the knowledge of so great things should either
   be quite buried, or greatly obscured, or wrapped in divers doubts. For
   we see that Satan used all his engines, that he might so bring to pass,
   that never any of the acts of the apostles might come to light, but
   such only as were mixed with lies; to the end he might bring into
   suspicion what thing soever was spoken of them, and so by that means
   might pluck out of the minds of the godly all the remembrance of that
   age. For he always raised up, either doting fools or crafty flouters,
   [14] that they might spread abroad a sort of filthy fables under the
   names of other men; the blockishness whereof did much discredit even
   the true histories.

   So in those books of Peter and Paul, which are reigned to be of Linus
   his doing, are contained such a sort of stinking trifles, that they
   cause the wicked to laugh at them, and the godly to loathe them. So
   that reigned disputation of Peter with Simon Magus is so ridiculous,
   that it doth discredit the name of a Christian. The same opinion must
   we have of all that mingle-mangle, [15] which is set before the
   Recognitions and Councils of Clement, and recited of Gratianus in his
   Fragments. They beguile the unskillful under color of ancient names;
   the wicked boast of those as of oracles, no less boldly than
   impudently, when as, indeed, they are filthy toys. Satan did use such
   liberty to lie, that we might have no certain thing left us after
   Christ's ascension. So that unless this work [16] of Luke were extant,
   it might seem that Christ being taken up into heaven, left no fruit of
   his death or resurrection upon earth. For all should have vanished away
   with his body. We should not know that Christ was so received into his
   celestial glory, that, nevertheless, he beareth rule in all the world;
   we should not know that the gospel was published by the apostles, and
   so came from them unto us, though by the means of others; [17] we
   should not know that they were inspired by the Holy Ghost, lest they
   should teach anything but that which was divine, to the end our faith
   might be grounded only upon the infallible verity of God. Last of all,
   we should not know that that prophecy of Esaias was fulfilled, wherein
   he foretold that the law should come out of Sion, and the Word of the
   Lord out of Jerusalem.

   Seeing this book proceeding, no doubt, from the Spirit of God, taketh
   from us all doubting of these things, we must count the same as a great
   treasure, as I have said before not without cause, and now again
   confirm the same.

   COMMENTARY

   UPON

   THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 1:1-2

   1. The former speech truly have we had, O Theophilus, of all things
   which Jesus began to do and teach, 2. Even until that day, wherein,
   after he had given commandment by the Holy Ghost to the apostles, which
   he had chosen, he was taken up.


   That he may pass over unto those things which followed the ascension of
   Christ, he briefly gathereth the sum of all those which before he had
   handled in the former book, that he may annex this thereunto. And he
   briefly setteth down this description of the history of the gospel,
   that it is a narration of those things which Christ did and said so
   long as he was conversant upon earth. Furthermore, whereas they
   interpret this commonly, that there was first in Christ purity of life,
   before such time as he began to preach, it maketh nothing unto Luke's
   mind. Truth it is, that the manners of a good and godly teacher ought
   so to be framed, that he speak first with his life, then with his
   tongue, otherwise he should differ nothing from a stage-player. But
   Luke hath respect rather unto that which he had said about the end of
   his gospel, (Luke 24:19,) namely, that Christ was a prophet mighty in
   deed and word, that is, such a one as did excel no less in deeds than
   in words; although there be but small difference betwixt these two
   places. For the mightiness of works which is commended there doth
   belong unto his miracles, but this, to do, doth reach further in my
   opinion, namely, that under the same are comprehended all the famous
   acts which were proper unto his ministry, wherein his death and
   resurrection are the chiefest. For the office of the Messias did not
   only consist in doctrine, but it was also behoveful that he should make
   peace between God and man, that he should be a Redeemer of the people,
   a restorer of the kingdom, and an author of everlasting felicity. All
   these things, I say, as they were promised of the Messias, so were they
   looked for at his hands.

   Now we see that the sum of the gospel consisteth of these two parts,
   namely, of the doctrine of Christ, and of his acts; forasmuch as he did
   not only bring unto men that embassage which was given him in charge of
   his Father, but also performed all things that could be required of the
   Messias. He began his kingdom, he pacified God with his sacrifice, he
   purged man's sins with his own precious blood, he subdued death and the
   devil, he restored us unto true liberty, he purchased righteousness and
   life for us. And to the end that whatsoever he either did or said might
   be certain, he proved himself by miracles to be the Son of God. So that
   this word, to do, is extended unto his miracles also; but it must not
   be restrained only unto the same. Here must we note, that those which
   have only the bare knowledge of the history have not the gospel; unless
   the knowledge of the doctrine which maketh manifest the fruits of the
   acts of Christ be adjoined thereunto. For this is a holy knot which no
   man may dissolve. Therefore, whensoever mention is made of the doctrine
   of Christ, let us learn to adjoin thereunto his works, as seals whereby
   the truth thereof is established and confirmed, and the effect
   declared. Furthermore, that we may reap commodity by his death and
   resurrection, and also that miracles may have their use, we must always
   have respect unto him that speaketh. For this is the true rule of
   Christianity.

   1. Of all things which he began I do not greatly mislike the
   interpretation which some give of this place that Luke said rather of
   all than all; because it is possible in some measure to intreat of the
   works and doctrine of Christ, but to set down the whole course, that
   the narration may be perfect, were a matter of great [18] weight. Like
   as John doth declare that the world could not contain the books, (John
   21:25.) That is also to be noted that Luke saith, that he began his
   history at the beginning of the works of Christ. But so soon as he hath
   declared the nativity of Christ, he passeth over unto the twelfth year
   of his age (Luke 2:42;) and after he had briefly spoken of his
   disputation had in the temple with the doctors, passing over eighteen
   years without speaking any thing of them, he entereth [on] the just
   narration of the works of Christ. It is, therefore, manifest that those
   works and sayings only which make any thing unto the sum of our
   salvation are noted in this place. For, after that Christ came abroad
   into the world clothed with our flesh, he lived privately at home until
   he was thirty years of age, at which time his Father put upon him
   another manner of person. God would have him to lead the former part of
   his life obscurely, to this end, that the knowledge of these things
   might be more excellent which do edify our faith.

   The former speech. It seemed good to me to translate this on this wise,
   because logon poieisthai, is the same with the Grecians, which verba
   facere, or to speak, is with the Latins, as Budaeus doth note. And we
   must understand the contrariety of the second part, which he taketh in
   hand, that we may know that the evangelist determined with himself
   afresh to write, having new matter whereupon to write.

   2 Even until that day. Therefore, the ascension of Christ is the end of
   the history of the gospel. For he hath ascended, saith Paul, that he
   might fulfill all things, (Ephesians 4:10.) Our faith gathereth other
   fruit thereby; but it shall be sufficient to note in this place, that
   our redemption was fully complete and finished then when Christ did
   ascend unto his Father; and, therefore, that Luke did fully perform his
   duty in this narration, as touching the doctrine and works of Christ.
   And he is said to be taken up, that we may know that he is truly
   departed out of this world, lest we should consent unto their dotings
   who think that in his ascension there was no alteration of place made.

   Commandment by the Holy Ghost Luke showeth in these words, that Christ
   did not so depart out of the world that he did no longer care for us;
   for in that he hath ordained a perpetual government in his Church, he
   thereby declareth that he had a care to provide for our salvation; yea,
   he hath promised that he will be present with his to the end, (Matthew
   28:20,) like as, indeed, he is always present by his ministers. Luke,
   therefore, doth show unto us, that Christ did no sooner depart hence,
   but straightway he provided for the government of his Church; whence we
   may gather that he is careful for our salvation. And this his
   providence hath Paul plainly noted in the place lately cited, when he
   saith, That he hath fulfilled all things, making some apostles, some
   evangelists, some pastors, etc. But these commandments, which the
   evangelist saith Christ gave unto his disciples, do I interpret of the
   preaching of the gospel; like as ambassadors use to be instructed with
   certain precepts before they go of their embassage, lest they should
   rashly attempt any thing contrary to his will and mind that sendeth
   them. And all this is spoken in commendation of that doctrine which the
   apostles taught. The which that it may appear more manifestly, every
   thing is to be marked in order as it lieth. First of all, he saith they
   were elect and chosen of Christ, that we may be certain of their
   calling unto that function. Neither doth he in this place set God's
   election against man's merits, but only affirmeth that they were raised
   up by God, and that they did not rashly take upon them this function.
   That is true, indeed, that they were freely chosen; but now have we to
   inquire what is Luke's drift in this place. I say that he hath respect
   unto nothing else, but that we may be certain of the calling of the
   apostles, that we may learn not to have respect unto men, but unto the
   Son of God, the author thereof, because this must always be a maxim in
   the Church, that no man usurp any honor. Secondly, he saith, that they
   were instructed of Christ what they should do. As if he should say,
   that they uttered not their own inventions, but they delivered that
   sincerely and faithfully which was enjoined them by their heavenly
   Master. And to the end that that which Christ taught them might be the
   more reverenced, he addeth this, that this was done by the direction of
   the Holy Ghost. Not because the Son of God had any need to be guided by
   any other, who is eternal wisdom, but because he was also man, lest any
   man should think that he did deliver those things unto his disciples
   which he delivered by man's wit and reason, he calleth us back
   expressly unto the divine authority. Like as the Lord himself doth so
   often affirm, that he taught nothing but that which he had received of
   his Father; and therefore he saith, that his doctrine was not his own.
   Therefore, he signifieth that in the preaching of the gospel there is
   nothing which issueth from man's brain, but that it is the divine
   ordinance of the Spirit, whereunto the whole world must be subject.

   Acts 1:3-5

   3. To whom also he showed himself alive, after that he had suffered, in
   many proofs, while that he is seen of them by the space o f forty days,
   and he intreateth of the kingdom of God. 4. And when he had gathered
   them together, he commanded them that they should not depart from
   Jerusalem, but that they should wait for the promise of the Father;
   whereof, saith he, ye have heard of me: 5. Because John truly baptized
   with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, after a few
   days.


   3. Unto whom, etc He addeth this, that he might make the resurrection
   to be believed, as a thing most necessary to be known, and without the
   which the whole gospel falleth flat to the ground, neither remaineth
   there any more faith. And that I may omit to speak of other
   discommodities that come by being ignorant of the resurrection of
   Christ, the gospel loseth his whole authority, unless we know and be
   also fully persuaded that Christ being alive, speaketh unto us from the
   heavens. Whereunto Luke hath chiefest respect in this place. Therefore,
   that the truth hereof might not be called in question, he saith that it
   was proved by many signs and tokens. Those which Erasmus, following an
   old interpreter, doth call arguments, I have translated proofs. For
   Aristotle doth call that tekmerion, in the first book of his Rhetorics,
   which is necessary in signs. This is, therefore, that which I said
   before, that Christ did make manifest his resurrection unto his
   apostles by evident tokens, which did serve instead of necessary
   proofs, lest they should doubt of the same. Furthermore, he doth not
   reckon up those tokens and signs, saving only that he saith, that
   Christ did appear unto them about the space of a month and one-half
   oftentimes. If he had but once appeared unto them, it might have been
   somewhat suspicious, but in showing himself so often unto them, he
   dissolveth all doubts which might arise in their minds, and by this
   means, also, he putteth away the reproach of the ignorance which he
   said was in the apostles, lest it discredit their preaching.

   He intreateth of the kingdom of God He telleth us again that the
   apostles themselves were well taught [19] before such time as they took
   upon them to teach others; therefore, whatsoever things they uttered
   and brought to light, either by word or by writing, touching the
   kingdom of God, they are those speeches which Christ himself uttered.
   And hereby doth he briefly set down the end of the doctrine of the
   gospel; namely, that God may reign in us. Regeneration is the beginning
   of this kingdom, and the end thereof is blessed immortality; the middle
   proceedings are in a more ample going forward and increase of
   regeneration. But that this thing may appear more evidently, we must
   first note, that we are born, and that we live aliens and strangers
   from the kingdom of God, until such time as God doth fashion us again
   unto a new life. Therefore, we may properly set the world, the flesh,
   and whatsoever is in man's nature against the kingdom of God, as
   contrary to it. For the natural man is wholly occupied about the things
   of this world, and he seeketh felicity here; [20] in the mean season,
   we are as it were banished from God, and he likewise from us; but
   Christ, by the preaching of the gospel, doth lift us up unto the
   meditation of the life to come. And to the end he may the better bring
   this to pass, he reformeth all our earthly affections, and so having
   striped us out of the vices of our flesh, he separateth us from the
   world. And, like as eternal death is prepared for all those which live
   after the flesh, so in as much as the inward man is renewed in us, that
   we may go forward in the spiritual life, we draw nearer unto the
   perfection of the kingdom of God; which is the society of the glory of
   God. Therefore, God will reign in and amongst us now, that he may at
   length make us partakers of his kingdom. Hereby we gather that Christ
   did principally intreat of the corruption of mankind; of the tyranny of
   sin, whose bond-slaves we are; of the curse and guiltiness of eternal
   death, whereunto we all are subject, and also of the means to obtain
   salvation; of the remission of sins; of the denying of the flesh; of
   spiritual righteousness; of hope of eternal life, and of like such
   things. And if we will be rightly instructed in Christianity, we must
   apply our studies to these things.

   4. Gathering them together, he commanded, etc They had before done the
   duty of Apostles; but that lasted but a while; and, secondly, so far
   forth that they might with their preaching awake the Jews to hear their
   Master. And so that commandment to teach, which Christ had given them,
   (Matthew 10:7,) whilst he lived with them upon earth, was, as it were,
   a certain entrance into their apostleship which was to come, for which
   they were not yet ripe. Therefore, their ordinary function was not laid
   upon them, until such time as Christ was risen again; but they stirred
   up their nation (as I have said) like criers, that they might give ear
   to Christ. And then at length, after the resurrection, they were made
   Apostles, to publish abroad throughout the whole world that doctrine
   which was committed to them. And whereas after they were made Apostles,
   Christ commandeth them as yet to abstain from their office, that is
   done not without just cause; yea, many causes may be alleged why it
   should be so. That filthy forsaking of their Master was yet fresh; many
   notes and tokens of unbelief were yet fresh. Whereas, they had been so
   thoroughly taught, and had so suddenly forgotten all, they showed a
   manifest token of their great dullness of wit. Neither were they free
   from sluggishness, which could not otherwise fitly be purged, than by
   deferring the promised grace, that he might the more sharpen their
   desire. But this cause is chiefly to be noted, that the Lord did
   appoint a certain time for the sending of the Spirit, that the miracle
   might be the more apparent. Again, he suffered them to rest a while,
   that he might the better set forth the greatness of that business which
   he was about to commit unto them. And thereby is the truth of the
   gospel confirmed, because the Apostles were forbidden to address
   themselves to preach the same, until they should be well prepared in
   succession of time.

   And they were commanded to stay together, because they should all have
   one spirit given them. If they had been dispersed, the unity should not
   have been so well known. Though they were scattered abroad afterwards
   in divers places, yet because they brought that which they had from one
   and the same fountain, it was all one, as if they always had had all
   one mouth. Furthermore, it was expedient that they should begin to
   preach the gospel at Jerusalem, that the prophecy might be fulfilled,

   "There shall a law go out of Zion,
   and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem," (Isaiah 2:3.)

   Although the participle sunalizomenos, may be diversely translated, yet
   Erasmus his translation did please me best, because the signification
   of gathering together will agree better with the text, [context.]

   They should wait for the promise It was meet that these should be
   accustomed to obey first, who should shortly after lay Christ's yoke
   upon the neck of the world. And surely they have taught us by their
   example, that we must work and rest at the Lord's pleasure alone. For
   if, during our life, we go on warfare under his banner and conduct,
   surely he ought to have no less authority over us than any earthly
   captain hath in his army. Therefore, as warlike discipline requireth
   this, that no man wage unless he be commanded by the captain, so it is
   not lawful for us either to go out, or to attempt any thing, until the
   Lord give the watchword; and so soon as he bloweth the retreat, we must
   stay, [halt.] Moreover, we are taught that we are made partakers of the
   gifts of God through hope. But we must mark the nature of hope as it is
   described in this place. For that is not hope which every man feigneth
   to himself unadvisedly, but that which is grounded on the promise of
   God. Therefore Christ cloth not suffer his apostles to look for
   whatsoever they will, but he addeth expressly the promise of the
   Father. Furthermore, he maketh himself a witness thereof; because we
   ought to be so sure and certain, that although all the engines of hell
   gainstand us, yet this may remain surely fixed in our minds, that we
   have believed God. I know, saith Paul, whom I have believed, (2 Timothy
   1:12.) And here he putteth them in mind of those things which are
   written in John 14:15, 16,

   "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that
   he may continue with you; I say the Spirit of truth," etc.

   Again,

   "I have spoken these things unto you while I am with you." "And the
   Spirit, whom my Father shall send in my name, shall teach you all
   things," (John 14:25, 26,) etc.

   And again,

   "When the Spirit of truth shall come, whom I will send from my Father,
   he shall bear witness of me," (John 15:26.)

   And again,

   "If I shall go hence, I will send you the Comforter, who shall reprove
   the world," (John 16:7.)

   And he had said long before,

   "He which believeth in me, out of his belly
   shall flow rivers of living water,"
   (John 7:38.)

   5. Because John truly Christ repeateth this unto his apostles out of
   John's own words. For some part of them had heard that at John's mouth,
   which the Evangelists report, "I truly baptize you with water, but he
   that cometh after me shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with
   fire." Now Christ pronounceth that they shall well perceive that that
   is true indeed which he said. Furthermore, this serveth greatly to
   confirm the sentence next going before, for it is an argument drawn
   from the office of Christ. And that thus: John was sent to baptize with
   water, he fulfilled his function as it became the servant of God. The
   Son of God is sent to baptize with the Holy Ghost; it remained,
   therefore, that he do his duty. Neither can it be otherwise but he must
   do that which his Father hath commanded him to do, and for which also
   he came down into the earth. But it seemeth a very absurd thing to
   restrain that unto the visible sending of the Holy Ghost, which was
   spoken universally of regeneration. [21] I answer, that Christ did not
   then only baptize with the Holy Ghost, when as he sent him under the
   form of fiery tongues; for he had baptized his apostles before this;
   and he baptizeth all the elect thus daily. But because the sending of
   the Holy Ghost after so glorious a sort was a token of the hidden grace
   wherewith he doth daily inspire his elect, he doth fitly apply
   thereunto the testimony of John. And truly this was as though it had
   been the common baptism of the Church. For besides that the apostles
   did not receive the Spirit for themselves only, but for the use of all
   the faithful, there was also declared the universal favor of Christ
   towards his Church, while that he poured out thereupon the gifts of his
   Spirit in great abundance.

   Although, therefore, he doth daily baptize the elect of his Father, yet
   was this no let why he might not show forth this token to be remembered
   above all others, that the apostles might know that they were only
   entered by John; and that not in vain, seeing their perfection was hard
   at hand. And that is frivolous which some gather out of this place most
   commonly, [22] namely, that the baptism of John and the baptism of
   Christ were diverse. For here doth not he dispute in this place of
   baptism, but maketh only a comparison betwixt the person of John and
   the person of Christ. When as John did say that he did baptize with
   water only, he did not reason of what sort his baptism was; but what he
   himself was; lest he should arrogate that unto himself which was proper
   to Christ. As also, the ministers in these days ought not to speak
   otherwise of themselves; but they must acknowledge Christ to be the
   author of all those things which they do prefigure in the outward
   baptism, and leave nothing to themselves save only the outward
   administration. For when as these titles are attributed unto baptism,
   namely, that it is the laver of regeneration, (Titus 3:5,) a washing
   away of sins, the fellowship of death, and burying with Christ, (Romans
   6:4,) and a grafting into the body of Christ, it is not declared what
   man, being the minister of the outward sign, doth; but rather what
   Christ doth, who only giveth force and efficacy unto the signs. We must
   always hold fast this distinction, lest, whilst we deck man too much,
   we take from Christ. [23]

   But here may a question be moved, why he doth rather name John here
   than any other; first, It is manifest enough that John did profess
   himself to be the minister of the outward sign, namely, of water, and
   that Christ was the author of the spiritual baptism; secondly, Because
   it was meet that John should decrease and Christ increase; and,
   thirdly, Because the apostles did so much esteem of John, (John 3:30,)
   it might have been that thereby the glory of Christ might have been
   obscured. Therefore, Christ, to the end he might reclaim them to
   himself, telleth them that John did only minister unto them the
   external baptism; notwithstanding, he confirmeth them also, lest they
   should doubt of the promise; for they did attribute very much unto
   John, and therefore were they persuaded that the baptism which they had
   received by him was not in vain. Now, if that the verity and force
   thereof must be looked for at Christ's hands, then ought the apostles
   to hope that that shall surely be fulfilled which John prefigured.

   So must we, in like manner, think that we are not in vain baptized with
   water by men, because Christ, who commanded the same to be done, will
   fulfill his office, and baptize us with the Spirit. So faith draweth a
   consequent from the outward sign unto the inward effect; yet doth it
   not attribute any more than is meet, either to the sign or to the
   minister thereof, because in the sign it only looketh unto the promise,
   which is Christ's, and doth acknowledge him to be the only author of
   grace. Let us, therefore, use such a mean that we do in no part
   diminish Christ's honor; and yet, nevertheless, let us hope for that
   fruit by our baptism which is noted in this place. By assigning so
   short a time our Savior maketh them more joyful to hope well. Whereupon
   it followeth, that that death was not to be lamented which brought with
   it presently so precious fruit. And let us note this also, that this
   word baptism is used improperly in this place, that the contrariety may
   be full. After the same sort, Paul, in his Epistle unto the Romans,
   (Romans 3:26,) after he hath set down the law of works, to the end that
   the contrary may answer on the other side, he useth the law of faith
   for faith itself.

   Acts 1:6-8

   6. And when they, were gathered together, they asked him, saying, Lord,
   dost thou at this time restore the kingdom unto Israel? 7. And he said
   unto them, It is not for you to know the times and the seasons, which
   the Father hath placed in his own power. 8. But you shall receive power
   when as the Spirit shall come up. on you: and you shall be witnesses
   unto me, as well at Jerusalem as in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto
   the farthest part of the earth.


   6. He showeth that the apostles were gathered together when as this
   question was moved, that we may know that it came not of the
   foolishness of one or two that it was moved, but it was moved by the
   common consent of them all; but marvelous is their rudeness, that when
   as they had been diligently instructed by the space of three whole
   years, they betray no less ignorance than if they had heard never a
   word. There are as many errors in this question as words. They ask him
   as concerning a kingdom; but they dream of an earthly kingdom, which
   should flow with riches, with dainties, with external peace, and with
   such like good things; and while they assign the present time to the
   restoring of the same. they desire to triumph before the battle; for
   before such time as they begin to work they will have their wages. They
   are also greatly deceived herein, in that they restrain Christ's
   kingdom unto the carnal Israel, which was to be spread abroad, even
   unto the uttermost parts of the world. Furthermore, there is this fault
   in all their whole question, namely, that they desire to know those
   things which are not meet for them to know. No doubt they were not
   ignorant what the prophets did prophesy concerning the restoring of
   David's kingdom, they had oftentimes heard their Master preach
   concerning this matter. Lastly, It was a saying common in every man's
   mouth, that, in the most miserable captivity of the people, they should
   all be comforted, with the expectation of the kingdom that should be.
   Now, they hoped for the restoring hereof at the coming of the Messias,
   and hereupon was it that so soon as the apostles saw their Master
   Christ risen from the dead, they straightway began to think thereupon;
   but, in the meantime, they declared thereby how bad scholars they were
   under so good a Master. Therefore doth Christ briefly comprehend [24]
   in this short answer all the errors whereinto they fell in this their
   question, as I shall straightway declare. To restore, in this place,
   doth signify to set up again that which was fallen, and through many
   ruins grown out of fashion; for out of the dry stock of Isai [Jesse]
   should spring a Branch, and the tabernacle of David, which was laid
   waste, [25] should be erected and set on foot again.

   7. It is not for you to know, etc. This is a general reprehension of
   the whole question. For it was too curious for them to desire to know
   that whereof their Master would have them ignorant; but this is the
   true means to become wise, namely, to go as far forward in learning as
   our Master Christ goeth in teaching, and willingly to be ignorant of
   those things which he doth conceal from us. But forasmuch as there is
   naturally engendered in us a certain foolish and vain curiosity, and
   also a certain rash kind of boldness, we must diligently observe this
   admonition of Christ, whereby he correcteth both these vices. But to
   the end we may know what his meaning is hereby, we must mark the two
   members which he joineth together. "It is not for you" (saith he) "to
   know those things which the Father hath placed in his own power." He
   speaketh, indeed, of the times and seasons; but seeing there is the
   like reason in other things, we must think this to be a universal
   precept, That being contented with the revelation of God, we think it
   an heinous crime to inquire any further. This is the true mean between
   the two extremes. The Papists, that they may have somewhat wherewith to
   cloak their gross ignorance, say for themselves, that they omit the
   hidden mysteries of God, as though our whole faith and religion did
   consist upon any thing else than upon the hidden mysteries of God; then
   may we take our leave of Christ and his gospel, if we must abstain
   utterly from the hidden mysteries of God. But we must keep, as I said
   before a mean herein; for we must be desirous to learn so far as our
   heavenly Master doth teach us; but as for such things as he will have
   us ignorant of, let mine be so bold as to inquire after them that we
   may be wise with sobriety. Therefore, so often as we are vexed with
   this foolish desire of knowing more than we ought, let us call to mind
   this saying of Christ, "It is not for you to know." For unless we will
   burst in against his will and commandment, this shall have force and
   strength enough to restrain the outrageousness of our wits.

   Now, as touching the foreknowledge of times, Christ condemneth only the
   searching out thereof which reacheth beyond the measure of God's
   revelation; and that is to be noted out of the second member, as before
   I have said, "which the Father hath placed in his own power." Truth it
   is, that God hath in his own power winter and summer, and the rest of
   the seasons of the year, cold and heat, fair weather and foul. But
   because he hath testified that the course of the years shall be
   perpetual, (Genesis 1:14,) he is said not to have placed that in his
   own power which he hath revealed unto men. What thing soever the
   philosophers or husbandmen do comprehend or understand by art, by
   learning, by judgment, or experience, all that doth God not retain unto
   himself, because he hath after a certain sort revealed it unto them,
   (Genesis 8:22.) The same opinion must we have of the prophets; for it
   was their office to know those things which God did reveal. But we must
   be ignorant of the secret events of things, as touching the time to
   come; for there is nothing which may make us more slack in doing our
   duties, than too careful an inquisition herein, for we will always take
   counsel according to the future event of things; but the Lord, by
   hiding the same from us, doth prescribe unto us what we ought to do.
   Here ariseth a conflict, because we will not willingly suffer God to
   have that which is his own, namely, the sole government and direction
   of things which are to come; but we cast ourselves into a strange and
   inordinate carefulness. To conclude, Christ forbiddeth us to apply
   those things unto ourselves, which God doth challenge as proper to
   himself alone. Of this sort is the foreknowledge of those things which
   God hath taken to himself to govern and direct, according to his own
   pleasure, far contrary to our opinion, and otherwise than we could
   invent. [26]

   8. You shall receive power. Our Savior Christ doth here call them back
   as well unto the promise of God as also unto his commandment, which was
   the readiest way to bridle their curiosity. Curiosity doth rise almost
   always either of idleness or else of distrust; distrust is cured by
   meditating upon the promises of God. And his commandments do tell us
   how we ought to occupy ourselves and employ our studies. Therefore, he
   commandeth his disciples to wait for the promise of God, and to be
   diligent in executing their office whereunto God had called them. And
   in the mean season he noteth [27] their great hastiness, in that they
   did preposterously catch at those gifts which were proper unto the Holy
   Spirit, when as they were not as yet endued with the same. Neither did
   they take the right way herein, in that being called to go on warfare,
   they desire (omitting their labor) to lake their ease in their inn.
   [28] Therefore, when he saith, you shall receive power, he admonisheth
   them of their imbecility, lest they follow before the time those things
   whereunto they cannot attain. It may be read very well either way, You
   shall receive the power of the Spirit; or, The Spirit coming upon you;
   yet the latter way seemeth to be the better, because it doth more fully
   declare their defect trod want, until such time as the Spirit should
   come upon them.

   You shall be my witnesses He correcteth two errors of theirs in this
   one sentence. For, first, he showeth that they must fight before they
   can triumph; and, secondly, that the nature of Christ's kingdom was of
   another sort than they judged it to have been. Therefore, saith he, You
   shall be my witnesses; that is, the husbandman must first work before
   he can reap his fruits. Hence, nay we learn that we must first study
   how we may come unto the kingdom of God, before we begin to dispute
   [29] about the state of the life to come. Many there be which do
   curiously inquire what manner [of] blessedness that shall be which they
   shall enjoy after they shall be received into the everlasting kingdom
   of heaven, not having any care how they may come to enjoy the same.
   [30] They reason concerning the quality of the life to come, which they
   shall have with Christ; but they never think that they must be
   partakers of his death, that they may live together with him, (2
   Timothy 2:11.) Let every man, therefore, apply himself in his work
   which he hath in hand; let us fight stoutly under Christ's banner; let
   us go forward manfully and courageously [31] in our vocation, and God
   will give fruit in due time (and tide.) There followeth another
   correction, when he saith, that they must be his witnesses. For hereby
   he meant to drive out of his disciples' minds that fond and false
   imagination which they had conceived of the terrestrial kingdom,
   because he showeth unto them briefly, that his kingdom consisteth in
   the preaching of the gospel. There was no cause, therefore, why they
   should dream of riches, [32] of external principality, or any other
   earthly thing, whilst they heard that Christ did then reign when as he
   subdueth unto himself (all the whole) world by the preaching of the
   gospel. Whereupon it followeth that he doth reign spiritually, and not
   after any worldly manner. And that which the apostles had conceived of
   the carnal kingdom proceeded from the common error of their nation;
   neither was it marvel if they were deceived herein. [33] For when we
   measure the same with our understanding, what else can we conceive but
   that which is gross and terrestrial? Hereupon it cometh, that, like
   brute beasts, we only desire that which is commodious for our flesh,
   and therefore we rather catch that which is present. Wherefore, we see
   that those which held opinion, that Christ should reign as a king in
   this world a thousand years [34] fell into the like folly. Hereupon,
   also, they applied all such prophecies as did describe the kingdom of
   Christ figuratively by the similitude of earthly kingdoms unto the
   commodity of their flesh; whereas, notwithstanding, it was God's
   purpose to lift up their minds higher. As for us, let us learn to apply
   our minds to hear the gospel preached, lest we be entangled in like
   errors, which prepareth a place in our hearts for the kingdom of
   Christ. [35]

   In all Judea Here he showeth, first, that they must not work for the
   space of one day only, while that he assigneth the whole world unto
   them, in which they must publish the doctrine of the gospel.
   Furthermore, he refuteth [36] the opinion which they had conceived of
   Israel. They supposed those to be Israelites only which were of the
   seed of Abraham according to the flesh. Christ testifieth that they
   must gather thereunto all Samaria; which, although they were nigh in
   situation, yet were they far distant in mind and heart. He showeth that
   all other regions far distant, and also profane, must be united unto
   the holy people, that they may be all partakers of one and the same
   grace. It is evident (John 4:9) how greatly the Jews did detest the
   Samaritans. Christ commanded that (the wall of separation being broken
   down) they be both made one body, (Ephesians 2:14,) that his kingdom
   may be erected everywhere. By naming Judea and Jerusalem, which the
   apostles had tried [37] to be full of most deadly enemies, he
   foretelleth them of the great business and trouble which was prepared
   for them, that he may cause them to cease to think upon this triumph
   which they hoped to have been so nigh at hand. [38] Neither could they
   be a little afraid to come before so cruel enemies, more to inflame
   their rage and fury. And here we see how he giveth the former place
   unto the Jews, because they are, as it were, the first-begotten,
   (Exodus 4:22.) Notwithstanding, he calleth those Gentiles one with
   another, which were before strangers from the hope of salvation,
   (Ephesians 2:11.) Hereby we learn, that the gospel was preached
   everywhere by the manifest commandment of Christ, that it might also
   come unto us.

   Acts 1:9-11

   9. And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken
   up on high, and a cloud received him out of their sight. 10. And while
   they looked up steadfastly into heaven, as he went, behold, two men
   stood by them in white apparel, 11. Which also said, Ye men of Galilee,
   why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up
   from you into heaven, shall so come as you have seen him go into
   heaven.


   9. The readers may learn out of our Institutions what profit we reap by
   the ascension of Christ. Notwithstanding, because it is one of the
   chiefest points of our faith, therefore doth Luke endeavor more
   diligently to prove the same; yea, rather, the Lord himself meant to
   put the same out of all doubt, when as he hath ascended so manifestly,
   and hath confirmed the certainty of the same by other circumstances.
   For, if so be it he had vanished away secretly, then might the
   disciples have doubted what was become of him; [39] but now, sith that
   they, being in so plain a place, [40] saw him taken up with whom they
   had been conversant, whom also they heard speak even now, whom they
   beheld with their eyes, whom also they see taken out of their sight by
   a cloud, there is no cause why they should doubt whither he was gone.
   Furthermore, the angels are there also to bear witness of the same. And
   it was needful that the history should have been set down so diligently
   for our cause, that we may know assuredly, that although the Son of God
   appear nowhere upon earth, yet doth he live in the heavens. And this
   seemeth to be the reason why the cloud did overshadow him, before such
   time as he did enter into his celestial glory; that his disciples being
   content with their measure [41] might cease to inquire any further. And
   we are taught by them that our mind is not able to ascend so high as to
   take a full view of the glory of Christ; therefore, let this cloud be a
   mean to restrain our boldness, as was the smoke which was continually
   before the door of the tabernacle in the time of the law.

   10. Two men He calleth them so by reason of their form. For although it
   might be that they had the bodies of men in deed, concerning which
   thing I will not greatly stand in defense of either part, yet certain
   it is they were not men; but because this metonymia is commonly used in
   the Scriptures, especially in the First Book of Moses, I will not
   greatly stand thereupon. Their white garments were a token of rare and
   excellent dignity. For God meant by this, as by an evident token to
   distinguish them from the common sort of people, that the disciples
   might give better ear unto them; [42] and that at this day we also may
   know that this vision was showed them of God.

   11. Ye men of Galilee, etc. I am not of their opinion who think that
   this name was given the apostles after an opprobrious sort, as if the
   angels meant to reprehend the slowness and dullness of the apostles. In
   my opinion, it was rather to make them more attentive, in that men,
   whom they did never see before, did name them as though they had
   perfectly known them. But they seem to reprehend without cause, for
   looking up into heaven. For where should they rather seek for Christ
   than in heaven? Doth not the Scriptures also oftentimes exhort us
   thereunto? I answer, that they were not reprehended because they looked
   up towards heaven; but because they coveted to see Christ, when as the
   cloud which was put between them and him did keep them from seeing him
   with their bodily senses: Secondly, because they hoped that he would
   return again straightway, that they might enjoy the sight of him again,
   when as lie did ascend to stay in the heavens until such time as he
   should come [43] to judge the world. Wherefore, let us first learn out
   of this place that we must not seek Christ either in heaven, either
   upon earth, otherwise than by faith; and also, that we must not desire
   to have him present with us bodily in the world; for he that doth [44]
   either of those two shall oftentimes go farther from him. So this their
   admiration is reprehended, not simply, but inasmuch as they were
   astonied by the strangeness of this matter; like as we are oftentimes
   carried unadvisedly into a wonderful great wondering at God's works;
   but we never apply ourselves to consider for what end and purpose they
   were done.

   Jesus, which is taken up into heaven There are two members in this one
   sentence. The first is, that Christ was taken up into heaven, that they
   may not henceforth foolishly desire to have him any longer conversant
   with them upon earth. The other is straightway added as a consolation
   concerning his second coming. Out of these two jointly, and also
   severally, is gathered a firm, stable, and strong argument, to refute
   the Papists, and all other which imagine that Christ is really present
   in the signs of bread and wine. For when it is said that Christ is
   taken up into heaven; here is plainly noted the distance of place. I
   grant that this word heaven is interpreted divers ways, sometimes for
   the air, sometimes for the whole connection [45] of the spheres,
   sometimes for the glorious kingdom of God, where the majesty of God
   hath his [its] proper scat, howsoever it doth fill the whole world.
   After which sort Paul doth place Christ above all heavens, (Ephesians
   1:22,) because he is above all the world, and hath the chiefest room in
   that place of blessed immortality, because he is more excellent than
   all the angels, (Ephesians 4:15.) But this is no let why he may not be
   absent from us bodily, and that by this word heavens, there may not be
   signified a separation from the world. Let them cavil as much as they
   will, it is evident that the heaven whereinto Christ was received is
   opposite to the frame of the world; therefore it doth necessarily
   follow, that if he be in heaven, he is without [beyond] the world.

   But, first, we must mark what the purpose of the angels was, for
   thereby we shall more perfectly know what the words mean. The angels'
   intent was to call back the apostles from desiring the carnal presence
   of Christ. For this purpose was it that they said that he should not
   come again until he came to judge the world. And to this end serveth
   the assigning of the time, that they might not look for him in vain
   before that same time. Who seeth not that in these words is manifestly
   showed that he was bodily absent out of the world? Who seeth not that
   we are forbidden to desire to have him upon the earth? But, they think
   they escape safe with that crafty answer, when as they say that then he
   shall come visibly; but he cometh now invisibly daily. But we are not
   here to dispute of his form; only the apostles are taught that Christ
   must abide in heaven until such time as he appear at the latter day.
   For the desiring of his corporeal presence is here condemned as absurd
   and perverse. The Papists deny that he is present in the sacrament
   carnally, while that his glorious body is present with us after a
   supernatural sort, and by a miracle; but we may well enough reject
   their inventions concerning his glorious body, as childish and
   frivolous toys. They feign unto themselves a miracle not confirmed with
   any testimony of Scripture. The body of Christ was then glorious, when
   as he was conversant with his disciples after his resurrection. This
   was done by the extraordinary and secret power of God; yet,
   notwithstanding, the angels do forbid to desire him afterward after
   that sort, and they say that he shall not come unto men in that sort
   (before the latter day.) Therefore, according to their commandment, let
   us not go about to pull him out of the heavens with our own inventions;
   neither let us think that we call handle him with our hands, or
   perceive him with our other senses, more than we can see him with our
   eyes. I speak always of his body. For in that they say it is infinite,
   as it is all absurd dream, so is it safely to be rejected.
   Nevertheless, I willingly confess that Christ is ascended that he may
   fulfill [fill] all things; but I say that he is spread abroad
   everywhere by the power of his Spirit, not by the substance of his
   flesh. I grant, furthermore, that he is present With us both in his
   word and in the sacraments. Neither is it to be doubted, but that all
   those which do with faith receive the signs of his flesh and blood, are
   made truly partakers of his flesh and blood. But this partaking doth
   nothing agree with the dotings of the Papists; for they feign that
   Christ is present in such sort upon the altar as Numa Pompilius did
   call down his Jupiter Elicitus, or as those witches did fetch down the
   moon from heaven with their enchantments. But Christ, by reaching us
   the bread in his Supper, doth will us to lift up our hearts into
   heaven, that we may have life by his flesh and blood. So that we do not
   eat his flesh grossly, that we may live thereby, but he poureth into
   us, by the secret power of his Spirit, his force and strength.

   He shall so come I have said before, that by this consolation all
   sorrow which we might conceive, because of Christ's absence, is
   mitigated, yea, utterly taken away, when as we hear that he shall
   return again. And also the end for which he shall come again is to be
   noted; namely, that he shall come as a Redeemer, and shall gather us
   with him into blessed immortality. For as lie doth not now sit idle in
   heaven, (as Homer signifieth, that his gods be busied only about their
   bellies;) so shall not he appear again without profit. Therefore, the
   only looking for Christ's coming must both restrain the importunate
   desires of our flesh, and support our patience in all our adversities;
   and, lastly, it must refresh our weariness. But it worketh this only in
   the faithful, which believe that Christ is their Redeemer; for it
   bringeth unto the wicked nothing but dread, horror, and great
   fearfulness. And howsoever they do now scoff' and jest when as they
   hear of his coming, yet shall they be compelled to behold him sitting
   upon his tribunal-seat, whom now they will not vouchsafe to hear speak.
   Furthermore, it were but frivolous to move any question about his
   apparel wherewith he was then clothed, whether he shall come again
   being clothed with the same or no. Neither am I now determined to
   refute that which Augustine, in his Epistle unto Consentius, doth
   touch, (August. ad Con. Epist. 146;) notwithstanding, it is better for
   me to omit that thing which I cannot unfold.

   Acts 1:12-14

   12. Then they returned unto Jerusalem from the mountain which is called
   Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, being distant about a
   Sabbath-day's journey. 13. And, coming in, they went up into an upper
   chamber, where abode Peter and James, John and Andrew, Philip and
   Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon
   Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. 14. These all abode together
   with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the wives, (or women,)
   and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.


   12. That he may pass over unto another history, he showeth that the
   disciples being returned unto Jerusalem, dwelt together in one parlor.
   For it was the upper part of the house, which used to be let out unto
   those which did hire houses; [46] for the most commodious places were
   reserved unto them that were masters of the house, (for their own use.)
   Wherefore, by this word Luke doth signify that they were driven into a
   strait room; [47] and yet, notwithstanding, though this commodity were
   great, yet they did not part asunder. They might have been more
   commodiously asunder, yet might they not part company before they had
   received the Spirit. In that he noteth here the distance of place, it
   bringeth credit unto the history. Unless, peradventure, he meant hereby
   to declare that they were not terrified with any fear of danger, but
   that they did all return and kept company together in one house, which
   was not so large, but that the company being greater than the place
   could well contain, it might breed some rumor (or noise.) A
   Sabbath-day's journey was two miles, and that account doth well agree
   with the place of John 11:18, where he saith, "that Jerusalem was
   distant from Bethany almost fifteen furlongs;" which containeth about a
   thousand and nine hundred paces. And the mount Olivet was at the side
   of Bethany. There was no Sabbath-day's journey prescribed in the law;
   for the Lord doth command them simply to rest upon the Sabbath-day in
   the law. [48] But because the Jews could not easily be ruled, but that
   they would run abroad about their business upon the Sabbath-day, (as
   the Lord himself doth complain, "that they did bear burdens out at the
   gates,") (Jeremiah 17:24,) therefore, it is to be thought that it was
   determined by the priests, [49] (to the end they might restrain such
   enormities,) that no man should travel upon the Sabbath-day above two
   miles. Although Jerome, in his Answers unto Algasia, doth say that this
   tradition did come from two Rabbins, namely, from Atriba, and from
   Simon Heli.

   13. Where they abode Some translate it, where they did abide; as though
   they did use to dwell there. But I am of that opinion, that they did
   then first of all use that hired room to dwell together in, until such
   time as the Holy Spirit was come upon them. Too, too ridiculous are the
   Papists, which go about to prove Peter his supremacy [50] hereby,
   because he is reckoned up first of all the apostles. Although we do
   grant that he was the chiefest of the apostles, yet it doth not follow
   hereupon that he was the chiefest ruler of all the world. But if he be,
   therefore, the chief of all the apostles, because his name is first in
   the catalogue of the apostles' names, I will again conclude, that the
   mother of Christ was inferior unto all the rest of the women, because
   she is [here] reckoned the last; which they will in no case admit, as
   indeed it were a thing too absurd. Wherefore, unless they will set
   their Papacy to be laughed at of all men, as hitherto they have done,
   they must leave off to adorn it with such foolish toys. But what is
   their intent? Forsooth, they will prove out of the Scriptures that
   there was a secondary head of the Church, inferior to Christ; whereas
   there is no syllable in the Scripture which is consenting unto this
   their foolish invention. No marvel is it, therefore, if they do snatch
   here and there certain places, which, although no man smite them out of
   their hands, they will let fall of their own accord. But omitting them,
   let us mark what is Luke's purpose in this place. Because the disciples
   had fallen away, and filthily fled from their Master Christ, every man
   whither fear did drive him, (Matthew 26:56,) they did deserve, like
   forsakers of their masters, or run-agates, to be deprived of honor.
   Therefore, that we may know that by the appointment of the Lord they
   were gathered together again, and restored to their former degree, Luke
   reckoneth up all their names.

   14. With their wives Some translate it women; and they think that he
   speaketh of those which accompanied Christ. As I will not contend with
   any man concerning this matter, so have I not doubted to prefer that
   which I thought was more probable. I grant that the word which Luke
   useth may be interpreted both ways. But this is my reason, why I do
   think that he speaketh rather of wives, because, seeing that they used
   afterward to carry their wives about with them, as Paul doth testify,
   (1 Corinthians 9:5,) it is not likely that they were then asunder. For
   they might more easily rest together in one place, than by wandering to
   and fro oftentimes to change their abiding; and, secondly, seeing that
   they did look for the coming of the Holy Ghost, which was even then at
   hand, what reason was there why they should deprive their wives of so
   great goodness? Peter's wife was about to be a helper unto him shortly
   after, which we must also think of the rest of the wives. These women
   had need of heroical fortitude and constancy, lest they should faint.
   Who would, therefore, think that they were excluded from their husbands
   whilst they look for the coming of the Spirit? But if they will stick
   to the general word, it standeth with reason that there were married
   women in the company. Howsoever it be, it is Luke's mind to tell us by
   the way how greatly they had changed their minds. [51] For whereas
   before the men, being afraid, had fled away, the women are gathered
   together with them now, neither do they fear any danger. He doth reckon
   up the mother of Jesus with the other women, whom, notwithstanding,
   John is said to have kept at his own house. But, as I have said before,
   they met altogether now only for a short season; for it is not to be
   doubted but that they departed one from another afterwards. It is well
   known that amongst the Hebrews all kinsfolk are comprehended under this
   word brethren.

   All these did continue. Here he showeth that they did diligently look
   for the coming of the Holy Spirit.; For this was the cause of their
   prayer, that Christ would send his Spirit, as he had promised.
   Whereupon we may gather that this is the true faith which stirreth us
   up to call upon God. For the security of faith doth much differ from
   sluggishness. Neither doth God, therefore, assure us of this grace,
   that our minds may straightway become careless, but that he may rather
   sharpen our desire to pray. Neither is prayer any sign of doubting, but
   rather a testimony of our (sure hope and) confidence, because we ask
   those things at the Lord's hands which we know he hath promised. So it
   becometh us also (after their example) to be instant in prayer, [52]
   and to beg at God's hands that he will increase in us his Holy Spirit:
   [53] increase, (I say,) because before we can conceive any prayer we
   must needs have the first-fruits of the Spirit. For as much as he is
   the only Master which teacheth us to pray aright, who doth not only
   give us utterance, (Romans 2:25,) but also governs our inward
   affections.

   Furthermore, Luke doth express two things which are proper to true
   prayer, namely, that they did persist, and that they were all of one
   mind. This was an exercise of their patience, in that Christ did make
   them stay a while, [54] when as he could straightway have sent the Holy
   Spirit; so God doth oftentimes drive off, [55] and, as it were, suffer
   us to languish, that he may accustom us to persevere. The hastiness of
   our petitions is a corrupt, yea a hurtful plague; wherefore it is no
   marvel if God do sometimes correct the same. In the mean season (as I
   have said) he doth exercise us to be constant in prayer. Therefore, if
   we will not pray in vain, let us not be wearied with the delay of time.
   As touching the unity of their minds, it is set against that scattering
   abroad, which fear had caused before. Yet, notwithstanding, we may
   easily gather, even by this, how needful a thing it is to pray
   generally, in that Christ commandeth every one to pray for the whole
   body, and generally for all men, as it were, in the person of all men:
   Our Father, Give us this day, etc., (Matthew 6:9.) Whence cometh this
   unity of their tongues but from one Spirit? Wherefore, when Paul would
   prescribe unto the Jews and Gentiles a right form of prayer, he
   removeth far away all division and dissension. That we may, (saith he,)
   being all of one mind, with one mouth glorify God, (Romans 15:6.) And
   truly it is needful that we be brethren, and agree together like
   brethren, that we rightly call God Father.

   Acts 1:15-22

   15. In those days, Peter standing up in the midst of the disciples,
   said, (and the company of names together was almost an hundred and
   twenty,) 16. Men and brethren, it was expedient that this Scripture
   should be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost foretold by the mouth of
   David concerning Judas, which was guide unto them which took Jesus: 17.
   Which was adopted into the number of us, and had obtained part [lot] of
   this ministry. 18. And he truly hath [had] possessed [or gotten] a
   field with the reward of iniquity, and being hanged, he burst in sunder
   in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out. 19. And this was known
   unto all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that that field is called, in
   their tongue, Aceldama, that is, The field of blood. 20. For it is
   written in the book of the Psalms, Let his habitation be void, and let
   there be none to dwell therein, and let another man take his bishopric.
   21. Of all those, therefore, which were gathered together with us all
   that time wherein the Lord Jesus went in and out amongst us, 22.
   Beginning from the baptism of John, until that day wherein he was taken
   up from us, must one be made a witness together with us of his
   resurrection.


   15. It was meet that Matthias should be chosen into the place of Judas,
   lest, through the treachery of one man, all that might seem to have
   been made of none effect which Christ had once appointed. He did not
   unadvisedly choose the twelve in the beginning, as principal preachers
   of his gospel. For when he said that they should be judges of twelve
   tribes of Israel, Luke 6:13, John 6:70; he showeth here that it was
   done of set purpose, that they might gather together the tribes of
   Israel unto one faith. But after that the Jews had refused the grace
   offered unto them, it was behoveful that the Israel of God should be
   gathered together out of all countries.

   This, therefore, was, as it were, a holy number, which, if it should
   have been diminished through the wickedness of Judas, then should the
   preaching of the gospel both have had, and also have, less credit at
   this day, if the beginning thereof had been imperfect. [56] Although,
   therefore, Judas would (as much as in him lay) have disappointed the
   purpose of Christ, yet nevertheless it stood firm and stable. He
   perished as he was worthy, yet did the order of the apostles remain
   whole and sound.

   The company of names It is uncertain whether he meaneth the men who
   only have the name properly, seeing the women are comprehended under
   the name of the men; or whether he taketh names simply for all the
   heads, as the Hebrews call them souls. This may also be called in
   question, whether they were wont daily to frequent that parlor in which
   the apostles did dwell, or they did continually dwell there with them.
   For the place was scarce able to contain so great a multitude, to serve
   them for all necessary uses. Surely it seemeth to me a thing more like
   to be true, that Luke doth in this place express the number of them,
   that we may know that they were all gathered together when Peter made
   this sermon. Whereby we may guess that they were not always present
   there. Although I dare not affirm any certain thing concerning this
   matter, yet being moved with a probable conjecture, I do rather lean
   unto this part, that the church was gathered together them because they
   had to intreat of a serious matter, and to this end also tendeth this
   word rising, [standing up.]

   16. It was meet that the Scripture should be fulfilled. Because Peter
   doth speak in this their assembly, therefore the Papists will have him
   to be the head of the church. [57] As though no man might speak in any
   assembly of the godly but he should straightway be Pope. We do grant,
   that as in every assembly there must be some which must be chief, so in
   this assembly the apostles did ascribe this honor unto Peter. But what
   maketh this unto (the proving of) their Papacy? Wherefore, bidding them
   adieu, [58] let us consider what the Spirit doth speak by the mouth of
   Peter. He saith That the Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, lest
   any man's mind should be troubled with that horrible fall of Judas. For
   it seemed a strange thing that he which was chosen by Christ unto so
   excellent a function, should so filthily fall in the beginning of his
   course. Peter removeth this stone of stumbling, when he saith that it
   was foretold by the Scripture. Whence we may gather an admonition very
   necessary for daily practice; namely, that we ought to attribute this
   honor unto the prophecies of the Scriptures, that they are able to
   appease all such fear as we conceive of the sudden event of things. For
   there is nothing which doth more trouble us than when we stay still in
   our own sense and understanding, and procure unto ourselves lets and
   doubts, [59] which the Lord would be ready to cure, if so be that we
   would hold fast this one thing, that nothing is absurd which he hath
   foreseen, appointed, and foretold, that he might make us more strong.
   Neither was Judas therefore excusable, because that which befell him
   was foretold, seeing that he fell away, not being compelled by the
   prophecy, but only by the malice of his own heart. The oration of Peter
   hath two parts. For, in the first place, he putteth away the offense
   which godly minds might have conceived by reason of the fall of Judas;
   whence also he gathereth an exhortation that the rest may learn to fear
   God. Secondly, he telleth them that it remaineth that they choose
   another into his place, both which he proveth by testimony of
   Scripture.

   Which the Holy Ghost foretold Such manner of speeches bring greater
   reverence to the Scriptures, whilst we are taught by them that David
   and all the rest of the prophets did speak only as they were directed
   by the Holy Ghost; so that they themselves were not the authors of
   their prophecies, but the Spirit which used their tongues as an
   instrument. Wherefore, seeing that our dullness is so great, that we
   ascribe less authority unto the Scriptures than we ought, we must
   diligently note such manner of speeches, and acquaint ourselves with
   them, that we may oftentimes remember the authority of God to confirm
   our faith withal.

   17. Adopted. It is word for word reckoned. And he saith that he was one
   of the number, that he might signify unto them that it was needful that
   the empty place should be filled, to the end that the number might
   continue whole. And to this propose serveth that which followeth, that
   he had obtained a part in the ministry. For thereupon it doth follow
   that the body should be, as it were, lame, if that part should be
   wanting. Surely it was a thing which might make them greatly amazed,
   that he whom Christ had extolled unto so high dignity should fall
   headlong into such destruction. Which circumstance doth increase the
   cruelty of the fact, [60] and teacheth the rest to take heed unto
   themselves. [61] Neither is it to be doubted but that the disciples did
   remember Judas with great grief and sorrow. But Peter doth here express
   by name the excellency of his function, that he might make them more
   attentive and more careful to provide a remedy.

   18. And he truly It seemeth unto me a thing like to be true, that this
   narration of the death of Judas was put in by Luke; therefore, it
   seemeth good to me to include it within a parenthesis, that it may be
   separated from Peter's sermon. For to what end should Peter here reckon
   up unto the disciples those things which they already knew well enough?

   Secondly, it should have been an absurd thing to have spoken after this
   among them, that the field which was bought with the money that was
   given to betray Christ was called of the Hebrews, in their own mother
   tongue, Aceldama. But whereas some do answer, that Peter spoke this
   unto the Galileans, whose speech did disagree with the Jewish tongue,
   it is but vain and frivolous. In very deed they did somewhat disagree
   in pronunciation; yet not so much but that they did well understand one
   another; like as do these of Paris and the men of Rouen.

   Furthermore, how could this be a fit word for Jerusalem, where Peter
   made his sermon? To what end should he interpret in Greek among the
   Hebrews their own mother tongue? Therefore doth Luke of himself put in
   this sentence concerning the death of Judas, lest Peter's words might
   seem strange [62] through ignorance of that history.

   He possessed a field This word hath a double signification, which, in
   my opinion, doth rather signify in this place to possess than to get;
   yet because it skilleth little whether way we read it, I leave it
   indifferent. And he speaketh after this sort, not because Judas had the
   use of the field, or that he himself did buy it, seeing it was bought
   after his death. But Luke's meaning was, that his burial was the
   perpetual note of ignominy; was the reward which he had for his
   falsehood and wicked act. Neither did he so much sell Christ for thirty
   pieces as his apostleship. He enjoyed not the money; [63] he only
   possessed the field. Furthermore, it came to pass through the marvelous
   providence of God, that the very common name of the field should be a
   note of infamy for the priests, which had bought (the) innocent blood
   of [from] the traitor. He saith that the Hebrews did call it by that
   name in their tongue, because he himself was a Grecian born; and he
   calleth that the Hebrew tongue which the Jews did use after the
   captivity of Babylon, namely, such as was mixed of the Assyrian tongue
   and of the Chaldean tongue.

   It is written in the book of Psalms He taketh away, by authority of
   Scriptures, all offense which might have happened by reason of the
   falling away of Judas. Yet might this place seem to be greatly wrested:
   First, in that David did not wish that these things might befall any
   particular person, but (in the plural number) he wisheth them unto his
   enemies. Secondly, it seemeth that Peter doth apply these things amiss
   unto Judas, which were spoken of the enemies of David. I answer, that
   David doth there speak after this [afterwards] of himself, that he may
   describe the condition and state of Christ's kingdom.

   In that Psalm (I say) is contained the common image of the whole
   Church, which is the body of the Son of God. Therefore, the things
   which are there set down must needs have been fulfilled in the head,
   which are indeed fulfilled, as the evangelists do testify, know, if any
   man object that those things which there were spoken against the
   enemies of David do not fitly agree unto Judas, we may easily gather
   that they do so much the rather agree with him, because David doth not
   respect himself as being separated from the body of the Church; but
   rather as he was one of the members of Christ, and so taking upon him
   his image, he steppeth forth in his name.

   Whosoever shall mark that this singular person was attributed to David,
   that he should be a figure of Christ, will not marvel if all these
   things be applied unto him which were prefigured in David. Although,
   therefore, he doth comprehend the whole Church, yet he beginneth at the
   head thereof, and doth especially describe what things Christ should
   suffer by the hands of the wicked. For we learn out of Paul's doctrine,
   that whatsoever afflictions the godly suffer, they are part of the
   afflictions of Christ, and serve to the fulfilling of the same,
   (Colossians 1:14.) This order and connection did David observe, or
   rather the Spirit of God, who meant by the mouth of David to instruct
   the whole Church. But as touching the persecutors of Christ, all that
   which is commonly spoken of them is by good right referred unto their
   standard-bearer; whose impiety and wickedness, as it is most famous, so
   his punishment ought to be made known unto all men. If any man do
   object again, that that which is recited in the Psalm is only certain
   cursings, and not prophecies; and that, therefore, Peter doth gather
   improperly that it was of necessity that it should be fulfilled, it is
   soon answered. For David was not moved with any perverse or corrupt
   affection of the flesh to crave vengeance; but he had the Holy Spirit
   to be his guide and director. Therefore, what things soever he prayed
   for there, being inspired with the Holy Ghost, they have the same
   strength which prophecies have, because the Spirit doth require no
   other thing than that which God hath determined with himself to
   perform, and will also promise unto us. But whereas Peter doth cite out
   of the Scriptures two diverse testimonies; by the first is meant, that
   Judas, together with his name and family, should quite be extinguished,
   that his place might be empty; the other, which he fetcheth out of the
   109th Psalm, tendeth to this end, that there should be another chosen
   to supply his place. These seem at first to be contrary; namely, a
   waste habitation and succession. Yet, because the Spirit saith only, in
   the former place, that the adversaries of the Church should be taken
   away, that their place might be empty, and without one to dwell
   therein, in respect of themselves, this is no let why another may not
   afterward supply their empty place. Yea, this doth also augment their
   punishment, in that the honor, after it was taken from him that was
   unworthy thereof, is given to another.

   And his bishopric The Hebrew word could not be translated more fitly.
   For phkvdh (pecudah) doth signify a jurisdiction or government, so
   called of the overseeing and beholding of things. For as for those
   which interpret it wife, the text [64] refuteth them; for it followeth
   in the next verse, of his wife, that she may be made a widow.
   Therefore, after that he had wished that the wicked may be deprived of
   his life, he addeth, moreover, that he may be spoiled of his honor;
   neither doth he stay here, but also he desireth that another may
   succeed him, whereby, as I have said before, his punishment is doubled.
   In the meanwhile, he noteth by the way, [65] that this false,
   treacherous, and wicked person, whereof he speaketh, should not be some
   one of the common sort, but such an one as should be indued with honor
   and dignity; from which, nevertheless, he shall fall. And out of this
   place must we learn, that the wicked shall not escape scott free, which
   have persecuted the Church of God; for this miserable and wretched end
   is prepared for them all.

   21. We must therefore. This which he bringeth in might seem, at the
   first sight, to be far set [fetched.] For if so be it David did speak
   of transposing [66] Judas's bishopric, it did not thereupon straightway
   follow that the disciples should choose another to be his successor;
   yet, because they knew that they had this charge given them to order
   the Church, so soon as Peter had told them that it did please the Lord
   that it should be so, he gathereth thereupon that they ought to do it.
   For whensoever God will use as means, [67] to maintain the government
   of his Church, so soon as we know what his will is, we must not linger,
   but stoutly perform whatsoever is required in our ministry (and
   function.) That was, without all controversy, what was the duty of the
   Church; like as, at this day, when we hear that those must be put from
   their office which behave themselves ungodly and wickedly, and that
   others must be chosen in their rooms, the Church must take this charge
   in hand. Wherefore, it was superfluous to move any question about a
   thing that was not to be doubted of. Therefore, let us always remember
   to consider what we have to do, that we may be ready to obey the Lord.
   Furthermore, when as he intreateth of the making of an apostle, he
   saith, He must be a witness of the resurrection; which signifieth that
   the apostleship is not without the preaching of the gospel. Whence it
   may appear how vain and frivolous the Popish bishops are, which having
   on only dumb visors, brag that they are the successors of the apostles;
   but wherein are they like unto them? I grant that Peter doth here
   require such a witness as saw the Lord after his resurrection, of which
   sort John professeth himself to be one, when he saith, "He which saw it
   beareth witness," (John 19:35.) For this did serve for the confirmation
   of faith; yet, nevertheless, Peter maketh it a thing necessary in him
   and the rest of his fellows in office, that they should teach, whilst
   he maketh them and himself preachers or witnesses of the resurrection.

   He nameth the resurrection, not because they must bear witness thereof
   alone; but because, first, under this is comprehended the preaching of
   the death of Christ; secondly, because we have the end of our
   redemption therein, and the accomplishment thereof, and also it
   bringeth with it the celestial government of Christ, and the power of
   the Spirit in defending his, in establishing justice and equity, in
   restoring order, in abolishing the tyranny of sin, and in putting to
   flight all the enemies of the Church. Let us know, therefore, that
   those things are not excluded by this word which are necessarily knit
   together. Nevertheless, let us note that the resurrection is here named
   before other things, as being the chief point of the gospel, as also
   Paul teacheth, (1 Corinthians 15:17.)

   But were the apostles alone witnesses of the resurrection? Was not this
   also common to the rest of the disciples? For Peter seemeth to
   challenge this as proper only to the apostles. I answer, that this
   title is therefore attributed unto them, because they were chosen
   peculiarly unto that function, and because they had the chief room
   amongst those which did bring this embassage; therefore, though they
   were the chief of those which were assigned, yet were not they only
   appointed thereunto.

   All that time. He beginneth at that time when Jesus began to show
   himself unto the world, which is diligently to be observed, as before I
   have said; for he lived privately until such time as he was almost
   thirty years of age. For he would not make himself known further than
   was needful for our salvation. Therefore, when the time was come
   wherein he must go about that business which his Father had appointed
   him, he came abroad like a new man, and one that was but lately born.
   Every man may easily perceive what great force this hath to bridle our
   curiosity. The whole life of Christ might have been a mirror most
   marvelous, [68] of more than absolute perfection; and yet,
   notwithstanding, that he might keep us occupied in the study and
   meditation of those things which were most needful to be known, he
   would lead the better part of his life obscurely and in secret. [69]
   Who dare now wander without Christ, seeing that he doth apply the
   knowledge of himself to the edifying of faith?

   The Hebrews take this, to go in and out, for to be conversant and to
   lead the life among men. In which sense, citizens are said to go in and
   out by the gates of their city; so John 10:9,

   "If any man enter in by me, he shall go in and out,
   and shall find pasture."

   Although, in the Second Book of the Chronicles, the first chapter, and
   tenth verse, it seemeth to be a token of rule and government.

   Acts 1:23-26

   23. Then they presented two, Joseph, whose sirname was Barsabas, which
   was called Justus, and Matthias. 24. And when they had prayed, they
   said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of men, show whether of
   these two thou hast chosen, 25. That he may take the room of this
   ministry and apostleship, from which Judas is fallen, that he might go
   unto his place. 26. And they gave in their lots, and the lot fell upon
   Matthias; and he was by common consent counted with the eleven
   apostles.


   23. They were to choose one only into the room of Judas; they present
   two. Here may a question be asked, Why they were not contented with one
   only? Was it because they were so like, that they could not discern
   whether was more fit? This truly had been no sufficient reason why they
   should suffer it to be decided by lots. And also it seemeth that Joseph
   was of greater estimation otherwise; or was it because they were
   diversely affectioned? But this seemeth scarce probable, neither is
   this to be admitted as true, because of that most excellent testimony
   which Luke did give a little before of their unity and agreement.
   Lastly, It had been very absurd for them to have polluted the election
   of the apostle with such strife and contention. [70] But for this cause
   did they use the casting of lots, that it might be known that Matthias
   was not only chosen by the voices of men, but also that he was made by
   the determination and judgment of God.

   For there was this difference between the apostles and the pastors,
   that the pastors were chosen simply by the Church, the apostles were
   called of God. In which respect Paul, in the preface of his Epistle to
   the Galatians, (Galatians 1:2,) doth profess himself to be an apostle,
   "neither of men, neither made by man." Therefore, like as the dignity
   of this function was excellent, so was it meet that in the choosing of
   Matthias, the chief judgment should be left unto God, howsoever men did
   their duty. Christ by his own mouth did appoint the rest; therefore, if
   Matthias had been chosen only by man to be one of them, he should have
   had less authority than they. This was very orderly done, [71] that the
   disciples should present unto God those whom they thought to be the
   best; and he should choose to himself whom he knew to be most fit, so
   that God, by the fall of the lot, doth pronounce that he did allow of
   the apostleship of Matthias. But the apostles might seem to have dealt
   very rashly and disorderly, which laid so great and weighty a matter
   upon a lot; for what certainty could they gather thereby? I answer,
   that they did it only as they were moved thereunto by the Holy Spirit;
   for although Luke doth not express this, yet, because he will not
   accuse the disciples of rashness, but rather doth show that this
   election was lawful and approved of God; I say, therefore, that they
   went this way to work, being moved by the Spirit, like as they were
   directed in all the action by the same Spirit. But why do they not pray
   that God would choose whom he would out of the whole multitude? Why do
   they restrain his judgment unto two? Is not this to rob God of his
   liberty, when as they tie him, and, as it were, make him subject unto
   their voices and consents? [72] But whosoever shall quietly ponder the
   matter shall plainly perceive, by the drift of Luke, that the disciples
   durst do nothing but that which they knew was their duty to do, and was
   commanded them by the Lord. As for the contentious, let them go shake
   their ears. [73]

   24. In praying, they said. Word for word it is, Having prayed, they
   said; but there is no obscurity in the sense, because his meaning was
   to speak as followeth, that they prayed; and yet he doth not reckon up
   all the words, being content briefly to show the sum. Therefore,
   although they were both of honest conversation, yea, although they did
   excel in holiness and other virtues, yet because the integrity of the
   heart, whereof God is the alone knower and judge, is the chief, the
   disciples pray that God would bring that to light which was hidden from
   men. The same ought to be required even at this day in choosing
   pastors; for howsoever we are not to appoint two for one, yet because
   we may oftentimes be deceived, and the discerning of spirits cometh of
   the Lord, we must always pray unto God, that he will show unto us what
   men he will have to be ministers, that he may direct and govern our
   purposes. Here we may also gather what great regard we must have of
   integrity and innocency in choosing pastors, without which both
   learning and eloquence, and what excellency soever can be invented, are
   as nothing. [74]

   25. [75] Of the ministry and apostleship. Because the word ministry was
   base, he addeth apostleship, wherein there is greater dignity; although
   the sense shall be more plain if you expound it, "the ministry of the
   apostleship." For the figure hypallage is common in the Scriptures.
   Assuredly Luke meant to join with the burden the excellency of the
   office, that it might have the greater reverence and authority; and yet
   this was his intent also, to declare that the apostles are called unto
   a painful function.

   26. They gave in their lots We will not, in this place, make any long
   disputation about lots. Those men who think it to be wickedness to cast
   lots at all, offend partly through ignorance, and partly they
   understand not the force of this word. There is nothing which men do
   not corrupt with their boldness and vanity, whereby it is come to pass
   that they have brought lots into great abuse and superstition. For that
   divination or conjecture which is made by lots is altogether devilish.
   But when magistrates divide provinces among them, and brethren their
   inheritance, it is a thing lawful. Which thing Solomon doth plainly
   testify, when he maketh God the governor of the event.

   "The lots (saith he) are cast into the bosom, and the judgment of them
   cometh forth from the Lord," (Proverbs 16:33.)

   This ordinance or custom is no more corrupt and depraved by corruption,
   than the corrupt vanity of the Chaldeans doth corrupt true and natural
   astrology. Whilst the Chaldeans go about, with the name of astrology,
   to cloak and color their wicked curiosity, they defame a science both
   profitable and praiseworthy. The same do those which tell men their
   destinies (as they call them) by casting lots; but it is our duty to
   discern the lawful use from the corruption. He saith the lots were
   given, that being put into a pot, or one of their laps, they might
   afterwards be drawn out. And here we must also note that this word lot
   is diversely taken in this place; for when he said before that Judas
   had obtained a lot of the ministry, his meaning was, (according to the
   common custom of the Scripture,) that he had a portion given him of the
   Lord. He speaketh afterwards properly, and without any figure of a lot,
   yet is it likely, forasmuch as the word gr'l, (goral) is commonly used
   by the Hebrews for both things, that Peter meant to allude unto that
   which they were about to do, and that Luke had respect unto the
   self-same thing.

   The lot fell upon Matthias. It came to pass as no man would have looked
   for; for we may gather by that which goeth before, that there was not
   so great account made of Matthias as of the other; for, besides that
   Luke gave him the former place, the two sirnames which Barsabas had do
   show that he was in great estimation. He was called Barsabas, (that is,
   the son of an oath, or of rest,) of the thing itself, as if he were
   some mirror, either of faithfulness and innocency, or of a quiet and
   modest nature. The other sirname did import singular honesty. This man,
   therefore, in men's judgment, was the former, [superior;] but God did
   prefer Matthias before him. Whereby we are taught that we must not
   glory if we be extolled unto the skies in the opinion of men, and if by
   their voices and consents [76] we be judged to be most excellent men;
   but we must rather have regard of this, to approve ourselves unto God,
   who alone is the most lawful and just judge, by whose sentence and
   judgment we stand or fall. And we may oftentimes mark this also, that
   God passeth over him which is the chiefest in the sight of men, that he
   may throw down all pride which is in man. In that he addeth, that he
   was reckoned amongst the rest, he wipeth away all sinister note of
   rashness from the casting of lots, because the Church did embrace him
   as chosen by God on whom the lot fell.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 2:1-4

   1. And when the day of Pentecost was fulfilled, they were all with one
   accord gathered together: 2. And there was made from heaven suddenly a
   sound, as it were when a violent wind breaketh in, and it filled all
   the house where they sat: 3. And they saw cloven tongues, as it were of
   fire, and it sat upon every one of them. 4. And they were all filled
   with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with strange tongues, even
   as the Spirit gave them to speak.


   1. And when. To be fulfilled is taken in this place for to come. For
   Luke beareth record again of their perseverance, when he saith that
   they stood all in one place until the time which was set them. Hereunto
   serveth the adverb, with one accord Furthermore, we have before
   declared why the Lord did defer the sending of his Spirit a whole month
   and a half. But the question is, why he sent him upon that day chiefly.
   I will not refute that high and subtle interpretation of Augustine,
   that like as the law was given to the old people fifty days after
   Easter, being written in tables of stone by the hand of God, so the
   Spirit, whose office it is to write the same in our hearts, did fulfill
   that which was figured in the giving of the law as many days after the
   resurrection of Christ, who is the true Passover. Notwithstanding,
   whereas he urgeth this his subtle interpretation as necessary, in his
   book of Questions upon Exodus, and in his Second Epistle unto
   Januarius, I would wish him to be more sober and modest therein.
   Notwithstanding, let him keep his own interpretation to himself. In the
   mean season, I will embrace that which is more sound.

   Upon the feast day, wherein a great multitude was wont to resort to
   Jerusalem, was this miracle wrought, that it might be more famous. And
   truly by means hereof was it spread abroad, even unto the uttermost
   parts and borders of the earth. [77] For the same purpose did Christ
   oftentimes go up to Jerusalem upon the holy days, [78] (John 2, 5, 7,
   10, 12,) to the end those miracles which he wrought might be known to
   many, and that in the greater assembly of people there might be the
   greater fruit of his doctrine. For so will Luke afterward declare, that
   Paul made haste that he might come to Jerusalem before the day of
   Pentecost, not for any religion's sake, but because of the greater
   assembly, that he might profit the more, (Acts 20:16.) Therefore, in
   making choice of the day, the profit of the miracle was respected:
   First, that it might be the more extolled at Jerusalem, because the
   Jews were then more bent to consider the works of God; and, secondly,
   that it might be bruited abroad, even in far countries. They called it
   the fiftieth day, beginning to reckon at the first-fruits.

   2. And there was made It was requisite that the gift should be visible,
   that the bodily sense might the more stir up the disciples. For such is
   our slothfulness to consider the gifts of God, that unless he awake all
   our senses, his power shall pass away unknown. This was, therefore, a
   preparation that they might the better know that the Spirit was now
   come which Christ had promised. Although it was not so much for their
   sake as for ours, even as in that the cloven and fiery tongues
   appeared, there was rather respect had of us, and of all the whole
   Church in that, than of them. For God was able to have furnished them
   with necessary ability to preach the gospel, although he should use no
   sign. They themselves might have known that it came to pass neither by
   chance, neither yet through their own industry, that they were so
   suddenly changed; but those signs which are here set down were about to
   be profitable for all ages; as we perceive at this day that they profit
   us. And we must briefly note the proportion of the signs. The violence
   of the wind did serve to make them afraid; for we are never rightly
   prepared to receive the grace of God, unless the confidence (and
   boldness) of the flesh be tamed. For as we have access unto him by
   faith, so humility and fear setteth open the gate, that he may come in
   unto us. He hath nothing to do with proud and careless men. It is a
   common thing for the Spirit to be signified by wind, (or a blast,)
   (John 20:22.) For both Christ himself, when he was about to give the
   Spirit to his apostles, did breathe upon them; and in Ezekiel's vision
   there was a whirlwind and wind, (Ezekiel 1:4.) Yea, the word Spirit
   itself is a translated word; for, because that hypostasis, or person of
   the Divine essence, which is called the Spirit, is of itself
   incomprehensible, the Scripture doth borrow the word of the wind or
   blast, because it is the power of God which God doth pour into all
   creatures as it were by breathing. The shape of tongues is restrained
   unto the present circumstance. For as the figure and shape of a dove
   which came down upon Christ, (John 1:32,) had a signification agreeable
   to the office and nature of Christ, so God did now make choice of a
   sign which might be agreeable to the thing signified, namely, that it
   might show such effect and working of the Holy Ghost in the apostles as
   followed afterward.

   The diversity of tongues did hinder the gospel from being spread abroad
   any farther; so that, if the preachers of the gospel had spoken one
   language only, all men would have thought that Christ had been shut up
   in the small corner of Jewry. But God invented a way whereby it might
   break out, when he divided and clove the tongues of the apostles, that
   they might spread that abroad amongst all people which was delivered to
   them. Wherein appeareth the manifold goodness of God, because a plague
   and punishment of man's pride was turned into matter of blessing. For
   whence came the diversity of tongues, save only that the wicked and
   ungodly counsels of men might be brought to naught? (Genesis 11:7.) But
   God doth furnish the apostles with the diversity of tongues now, that
   he may bring and call home, into a blessed unity, men which wander here
   and there. These cloven tongues made all men to speak the language of
   Canaan, as Isaiah foretold, (Isaiah 19:18.) For what language soever
   they speak, yet do they call upon one Father, which is in heaven, with
   one mouth and one spirit, (Romans 15:6.) I said that that was done for
   our sake, not only because the fruit came unto us, but because we know
   that the gospel came unto us not by chance, but by the appointment of
   God, who to this end gave the apostles cloven tongues, lest any nation
   should want that doctrine which was committed unto them; whereby is
   proved the calling of the Gentiles; and, secondly, hereby their
   doctrine doth purchase credit, which we know was not forged by man,
   seeing that we hear that the Spirit did dwell in their tongues.

   Now, it remaineth that we declare what the fire meaneth. Without all
   doubt, it was a token of the (force and) efficacy which should be
   exercised in the voice of the apostles. Otherwise, although their sound
   had gone out into the uttermost parts of the world, they should only
   have beat the air, without doing any good at all. Therefore, the Lord
   doth show that their voice shall be fiery, that it may inflame the
   hearts of men; that the vanity of the world being burnt and consumed,
   it may purge and renew all things. Otherwise they durst never have
   taken upon them so hard a function, unless the Lord had assured them of
   the power of their preaching. Hereby it came to pass that the doctrine
   of the gospel did not only sound in the air, but pierce into the minds
   of men, and did fill them with an heavenly heat (and burning.) Neither
   was this force showed only in the mouth of the apostles, but it
   appeareth daily. And, therefore, we must beware lest, when the fire
   burneth, we be as stubble. Furthermore, the Lord did once give the Holy
   Ghost under a visible shape, that we may assure ourselves that his
   invisible and hidden grace shall never be wanting to the Church.

   And it sat. Because the number is suddenly changed, it is to be doubted
   whether he speaketh of the fire. He said that there appeared tongues as
   it had been of fire. It followeth by and by, and it sat upon them.
   Notwithstanding, I refer it unto the Spirit. For the Hebrews use
   commonly to express the substantive of the verb in the second member,
   which they did omit in the former. Wherefore we have an example in this
   place: It sat upon them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.
   And we know that although Luke did write in Greek, yet is he full of
   those phrases which the Hebrews use. [79] Now, whereas he calleth the
   tongues the Holy Ghost, it is according to the custom of the Scripture.
   For John calleth the dove by the same name, (John 1:32,) because the
   Lord would testify and declare the presence of his Spirit by some such
   sign. If it were a vain sign, it should be an absurd naming (to call
   the sign by the name of the thing signified;) but where the thing is
   annexed, the name of the thing is fitly given to the sign which
   offereth the same unto our senses to be perceived. The fullness of the
   Spirit, wherewith he saith every one was replenished, doth not express
   the [an] equal measure of gifts in every one, but that excellence which
   should be meet for such a calling. [80]

   4. They began to speak He showeth that the effect did appear presently,
   and also to what use their tongues were to be framed and applied, But
   because Luke setteth down shortly after, that strangers out of divers
   countries did marvel, because that every one of them did hear the
   apostles speaking in their own tongue, some think that they spoke not
   in divers tongues, but that they did all understand that which was
   spoken in one tongue, as well as if they should hear their natural
   tongue. [81] Therefore, they think that one and the same sound of the
   voice was diversely distributed amongst the hearers. Another conjecture
   they have, because Peter made one sermon in the audience of many
   gathered together out of divers countries, who could not understand his
   speech (and language,) unless another voice should come unto their ears
   than that which proceeded out of his mouth. But we must first note that
   the disciples spoke indeed with strange tongues; otherwise the miracle
   had not been wrought in them, but in the hearers. So that the
   similitude should have been false whereof he made mention before;
   neither should the Spirit have been given so much to them as to others.
   Again, we hear how Paul giveth thanks to God, that he speaketh with
   divers tongues, (1 Corinthians 14:18.) Truly he challengeth to himself
   both the understanding, and also the use thereof. Neither did he attain
   to this skill by his own study and industry, but he had it by the gift
   of the Spirit. In the same place he affirmeth that it is an especial
   gift, wherewith all men are not endued. I suppose that it doth
   manifestly appear hereby that the apostles had the variety and
   understanding of tongues given them, that they might speak unto the
   Greeks in Greek, unto the Italians in the Italian tongue, [82] and that
   they might have true communication (and conference) with their hearers.
   Notwithstanding, I leave it indifference whether there was any second
   miracle wrought or no, so that the Egyptians and Elamites did
   understand Peter speaking in the Chaldean tongue, as if he did utter
   divers voices. For there be some conjectures which persuade me thus to
   think, and yet not so firm but that they may be refuted. For it may be
   that they spoke with divers tongues, as they light upon this man or
   that, and as occasion was offered, and as their languages were diverse.
   Therefore, it was a manifest miracle, when they saw them ready to speak
   divers languages. As touching Peter's sermon, it might be understood of
   the greater part of men wheresoever they were born; for it is to be
   thought that many of those which came to Jerusalem were skillful in the
   Chaldean tongue. Again, it shall be nothing inconvenient if we say that
   he spoke also in other tongues. Although I will not much stand about
   this matter; so that this be out of doubt, that the apostles changed
   their speech. [83]

   Acts 2: 5-12

   5. And there were at Jerusalem Jews abiding, godly men, out of every
   nation of those which are under heaven. 6. And when this was noised
   abroad, the multitude came together, and was astonished: because every
   one heard them speak in his own tongue. 7. And they wondered all, and
   marveled, saying amongst themselves, Behold, are not all these which
   speak men of Galilee? 8. And how do we every one hear them speaking in
   his own language, wherein we were born? 9. Parthians, and Medes, and
   Elamites, and inhabiters of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, of
   Pontus and Asia, 10. And of Phrygia and Pamphylia, of Egypt, and of the
   parts of Libya towards Cyrene, and strangers of Rome; 11. Jews and
   Proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues
   the wonderful works of God. 12. Therefore they were all amazed, and
   marveled, saying one to another, What meaneth this? Others mocking,
   said, They are full of sweet wine. [84]


   5. And there were at Jerusalem. When he calleth them godly or religious
   men, he seemeth to give us to understand that they came to Jerusalem
   that they might worship God; like as God, in all ages, after the
   scattering abroad, did gather together into that city some seed which
   remained, having, as it were, set up his banner, because as yet the
   temple did serve to some use. Yet, nevertheless, he showeth, by the
   way, who those be which profit by those miracles, whereby God doth
   declare his power. For wicked and profane men do either laugh at them,
   or else pass [care] not for them, as we shall see by and by.
   Furthermore, he meant to cite those as witnesses, which may the better
   be believed for their religion and godliness. When he said, out of
   every nation, he meaneth out of divers countries, whereof one is far
   from another. For he doth also afterwards reckon up those lands whereof
   one was far distant from another, of which sort are Libya and Pontus,
   Rome and Parthia, and Arabia, and such like. This serveth to increase
   the greatness of the thing. For the Cretians and men of Asia, dwelling
   so near together, might have some likelihood and agreement in speech;
   [85] but the same could not be betwixt the Italians and the men of
   Cappadocia, betwixt the Arabians and those of Pontus. Yea, this was
   also a work of God worthy to be remembered and wondered at, that in so
   huge and horrible a scattering abroad of the people, he did always
   reserve some relics, yea, he caused certain strangers to adjoin
   themselves unto a people which was in such misery, and, as it were,
   quite destroyed. For although they lived here and there in exile in far
   countries, and being one far from another, did, as it were, inhabit
   divers worlds, yet did they hold among themselves the unity of faith.
   Neither doth he call them unadvisedly, and without good consideration,
   godly men, and men fearing God.

   6. When this was noised abroad. Luke saith thus in Greek, This voice
   being made; but his meaning is, that the fame was spread abroad,
   whereby it came to pass that a great multitude came together. For if
   one after another in divers places, and at divers times, had heard the
   apostles speaking in divers tongues, the miracle had not been so
   famous; therefore they come altogether into one place, that the
   diversity of tongues may the better appear by the present comparison.
   There is a further circumstance also here to be noted, that the country
   (and native soil) of the apostles was commonly known, and this was also
   commonly known, that they never went out of their country to learn [86]
   strange tongues. Therefore, forasmuch as one speaketh Latin, another
   Greek, another the Arabian tongue, as occasion was offered, and that
   indifferently, and every one doth also change his tongue, the work of
   God appeareth more plainly hereby.

   11. The wonderful works of God. Luke noteth two things which caused the
   hearers to wonder; first, because the apostles being before ignorant
   and private persons, [87] born in a base corner, [88] did,
   notwithstanding, intreat profoundly of divine matters, and of heavenly
   wisdom. The other is, because they have new tongues given them
   suddenly. Both things are worth the noting, because to huddle out
   [utter] words unadvisedly and foolishly, should not so much have served
   to move their minds; and the majesty of the things ought the more to
   have moved them to consider the miracle. Although they give due honor
   to God, in that they are astonished and amazed, yet the principal and
   of the miracle is expressed in this, that they inquire, and thereby
   declare that they are prepared to learn; for otherwise their amazedness
   and wondering should not have done them any great good. And certainly
   we must so wonder at the works of God, that there must be also a
   consideration, and a desire to understand.

   12. Others mocking Hereby it appeareth how monstrous as well the
   sluggishness, as also the ungodliness of men is, when Satan hath taken
   away their mind. If God should openly (and visibly) descend from
   heaven, his majesty could scarce more manifestly appear than in this
   miracle. Whosoever hath any drop of sound understanding in him must
   needs be stricken with the only hearing of it. How beastly, then, are
   those men who see it with their eyes, and yet scoff, and go about with
   their jests to mock the power of God? But the matter is so. There is
   nothing so wonderful which those men do not turn to a jest who are
   touched with no care of God; because they do, even upon set purposes,
   harden themselves in their ignorance in things most plain. And it is a
   just punishment of God, which he bringeth upon such pride, to deliver
   them to Satan, to be driven headlong into blind fury. Wherefore, there
   is no cause why we should marvel that there be so many at this day so
   blind in so great light, if they be so deaf when such manifest doctrine
   is delivered, yea, if they wantonly refuse salvation when it is offered
   unto them. For if the wonderful and strange works of God, wherein he
   doth wonderfully set forth his power, be subject to the mockery of men,
   what shall become of doctrine, which they think tasteth of nothing but
   of that which is common? Although Luke doth signify unto us that they
   were not of the worst sort, or altogether past hope, which did laugh
   (and mock;) but he meant rather to declare how the common sort was
   affected when they saw this miracle. And truly it hath been always so
   in the world, for very few have been touched with the true feeling of
   God as often as he hath revealed himself. Neither is it any marvel; for
   religion is a rare virtue, and a virtue which few men have; which is,
   indeed, the beginning of understanding. Nevertheless, howsoever the
   more part of men, through a certain hard stiff-neckedness, doth reject
   the consideration of the works of God, yet are they never without
   fruit, as we may see in this history.

   Acts 2:14-21

   14. But Peter, standing with the eleven, lift up his voice, and spoke
   unto them, Ye men of Judea, and all ye which dwell at Jerusalem, let
   this be known unto you, and with your ears hear my words. 15. For these
   men are not drunk as ye suppose; for it is the third hour of the day.
   16. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel, 17. And it
   shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour out my Spirit upon
   all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your
   young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream dreams: 18.
   Verily, I will pour out of my Spirit in those days upon my servants,
   and upon mine handmaids, and they shall prophesy. 19. And I will show
   wonders in heaven above, and signs upon the earth beneath, blood and
   fire, and vapor of smoke. 20. The sun shall be turned into darkness,
   and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord
   do come. 21. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon
   the name of the Lord he shall be saved.


   14. And Peter, standing By this word standing he did signify, that
   there was a grave sermon made in the assembly; for they did rise when
   they spoke unto the people, to the end they might be the better heard.
   The sum of this sermon is this, he gathereth that Christ is already
   revealed and given by the gift of the Holy Ghost, which they saw. Yet,
   first, he refuteth that false opinion, in that they thought that the
   disciples were drunk. This refutation consisteth upon a probable
   argument; because men use not to be drunk betimes in the morning. For,
   as Paul saith,

   "Those which are drunk are drunk in the night,"
   (1 Thessalonians 5:7.)

   For they flee the light for shame. And surely so great is the
   filthiness of this vice, that for good causes it hateth the light. And
   yet this argument were not always good; for Esaias doth inveigh in his
   time against those which did rise early to follow drunkenness. And at
   this day there be many who, like hogs, so soon as they awake, run to
   quaffing. But because this is [89] a common custom amongst men, Peter
   saith, that it is no likely thing. Those which have but even small
   skill in antiquity do know that the civil day, from the rising of the
   sun until the going down thereof, was divided into twelve hours; so
   that the hours were longer in summer, and shorter in winter. Therefore,
   that which should now be the ninth before noon in winter, and in summer
   the eighth, was the third hour amongst the old people. [90] Therefore,
   whereas Peter doth only lightly remove the opinion of drunkenness, he
   doth it for this cause, because it had been superfluous to have stood
   about any long excuse. [91] Therefore, as in a matter which was certain
   and out of doubt, he doth rather pacify those which mocked, than labor
   to teach them. And he doth not so much refute them by the circumstance
   of time, as by the testimony of Joel. For when he saith that that is
   now come to pass which was foretold, he toucheth briefly their
   unthankfulness, because they do not acknowledge such an excellent
   benefit promised unto them in times past which they now see with their
   eyes. And whereas he upbraideth the fault of a few unto all, [92] he
   doth it not to this end, that he may make them all guilty of the same
   fault; but because a fit occasion was offered by their mocking to teach
   them altogether, he doth not foreslow the same. [93]

   17. It shall be in the last days By this effect he proveth that the
   Messiah is already revealed. Joel, indeed, doth not express the last
   days, (Joel 2:29;) but for as much as he intreateth of the perfect
   restoring of the Church, it is not to be doubted but that that prophecy
   belongeth unto the last age alone. Wherefore, that which Peter bringeth
   doth no whit dissent from Joel's meaning; but he doth only add this
   word for exposition sake, that the Jews might know that the Church
   could by no other means be restored, which was then decayed, but by
   being renewed by the Spirit of God. Again, because the repairing of the
   Church should be like unto a new world, therefore Peter saith that it
   shall be in the last days. And surely this was a common and familiar
   thing among the Jews, that all those great promises concerning the
   blessed and well-ordered state of the Church should not be fulfilled
   until Christ, by his coming, should restore all things. Wherefore, it
   was out of all doubt amongst them, that that which is cited out of Joel
   doth appertain unto the last time. Now, by the last days, or fullness
   of time, is meant the stable and firm condition of the Church, in the
   manifestation or revealing of Christ.

   I will pour out my Spirit He intendeth to prove, (as we have already
   said,) that the Church can be repaired by no other means, saving only
   by the giving of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, forasmuch as they did all
   hope that the restoring drew near, he accuseth them of sluggishness,
   because they do not once think upon the way and means thereof. And when
   the prophet saith, "I will pour out," it is, without all question, that
   he meant by this word to note the great abundance of the Spirit. And we
   must take I will pour out of my Spirit in the same sense, as if he had
   said simply, I will pour out my Spirit. For these latter words are the
   words of the prophet. But Peter followed the Grecians, who translate
   the Hebrew word ch, (cheth,) apo Therefore, some men do in vain more
   subtlely play the philosophers; because, howsoever the words be
   changed, yet must we still retain and keep the prophet's meaning.
   Nevertheless, when God is said to pour out his Spirit, I confess it
   must be thus understood, that he maketh manifold variety and change of
   gifts to flow unto men from his Spirit, as it were out of the only
   fountain, the fountain which can never be drawn dry. For, as Paul doth
   testify, there be divers gifts, and yet but one Spirit, (1 Corinthians
   12:4.) And hence do we gather a profitable doctrine, that we can have
   no more excellent thing given us of God than the grace of the Spirit;
   yea, that all other things are nothing worth if this be wanting. For,
   when God will briefly promise salvation to his people, he affirmeth
   that he will give them his Spirit. Hereupon it followeth that we can
   obtain no good things until we have the Spirit given us. And truly it
   is, as it were, the key which openeth unto us the door, that we may
   enter into all the treasures of spiritual good things; and that we may
   also have entrance into the kingdom of God.

   Upon all flesh It appeareth, by that which followeth, of what force
   this generality is; for, first, it is set down generally, all flesh;
   after that the partition is added, whereby the prophet doth signify
   that there shall be no difference of age or kind, but that God
   admitteth all, one with another, unto the partaking of his grace. It is
   said, therefore, all flesh, because both young and old, men and women,
   are thereby signified; yet here may a question be moved, why Clod doth
   promise that unto his people, as some new and unwonted good thing,
   which he was wont to do for them from the beginning throughout all
   ages; for there was no age void of the grace of the Spirit. The answer
   of this question is set down in these two sentences: "I will pour out,"
   and, "Upon all flesh;" for we must here note a double contrariety, [94]
   between the time of the Old and New Testament; for the pouring out (as
   I have said) doth signify great plenty, when as there was under the law
   a more scarce distribution; for which cause John also doth say that the
   Holy Ghost was not given until Christ ascended into heaven. All flesh
   cloth signify an infinite multitude, whereas God in times past did
   vouchsafe to bestow such plenty of his Spirit only upon a few.

   Furthermore, in both comparisons we do not deny but that the fathers
   under the law were partakers of the self, same grace whereof we are
   partakers; but the Lord doth show that we are above them, as we are
   indeed. I say, that all godly men since the beginning of the world were
   endued with the same spirit of understanding, of righteousness, and
   sanctification, wherewith the Lord doth at this day illuminate and
   regenerate us; but there were but a few which had the light of
   knowledge given them then, if they be compared with the great multitude
   of the faithful, which Christ did suddenly gather together by his
   coming. Again, their knowledge was but obscure and slender, and, as it
   were, covered with a veil, if it be compared with that which we have at
   this day out of the gospel, where Christ, the Sun of righteousness,
   doth shine with perfect brightness, as it were at noon day. Neither
   doth that any whit hurt or hinder that a few had such an excellent
   faith, that peradventure they have no equal at this day. For their
   understanding did nevertheless smell or savor of the instruction and
   schoolmastership [95] of the law. For that is always true, that godly
   kings and prophets have not seen nor heard those things which Christ
   hath revealed by his coming. Therefore, to the end the prophet Joel may
   commend the excellency of the New Testament, he affirmeth and
   foretelleth that the grace of the Spirit shall be more plentiful in
   time thereof; and, again, that it shall come unto more men, (Matthew
   13:17; Luke 10:24.)

   And your sons shall prophesy By the word prophesy he meant to note the
   rare and singular gift of understanding. And to the same purpose
   tendeth that partition which followeth afterwards, "your young men
   shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;" for we gather
   out of the twelfth chapter of Numbers, that these were the two ordinary
   ways whereby God did reveal himself to the prophets. For in that place,
   when the Lord exempteth Moses from the common sort of prophets, he
   saith,

   "I appear unto my servants by a vision, or by a dream; but I speak unto
   Moses face to face,"
   (Numbers 12:6.)

   Therefore, we see that two kinds are put after the general word for a
   confirmation; yet this is the sum, that they shall all be prophets so
   soon as the Holy Ghost shall be poured out from heaven. But here it is
   objected, that there was no such thing, even in the apostles
   themselves, neither yet in the whole multitude of the faithful. I
   answer, that the prophets did commonly use to shadow under tropes most
   fit for their time, [96] the kingdom of Christ. When they speak of the
   worship of God, they name the altar, the sacrifices, the offering of
   gold, silver, and frankincense. Notwithstanding, we know that the
   altars do cease, the sacrifices are abolished, whereof there was some
   use in time of the law; and that the Lord requireth some higher thing
   at our hands than earthly riches. That is true, indeed; but the
   prophets, whilst they apply their style unto the capacity of their
   time, comprehend under figures (wherewith the people were then well
   acquainted) those things which we see otherwise revealed and showed
   now, like as when he promiseth elsewhere that he will make priests of
   Levites, and Levites of the common sort of men, (Isaiah 66:21,) this is
   his meaning, that under the kingdom of Christ every base person shall
   be extolled unto an honorable estate; therefore, if we desire to have
   the true and natural meaning of this place, we must not urge the words
   which are taken out of the old order [97] of the law; but we must only
   seek the truth without figures, and this is it, that the apostles,
   through the sudden inspiration of the Spirit, did intreat of the
   heavenly mysteries prophetically, that is to say, divinely, and above
   the common order.

   Therefore, this word prophesy doth signify nothing else save only the
   rare and excellent gift of understanding, as if Joel should say, Under
   the kingdom of Christ there shall not be a few prophets only, unto whom
   God may reveal his secrets; but all men shall be endued with spiritual
   wisdom, even to the prophetical excellency. As it is also in Jeremiah,

   "Every man shall no longer teach his neighbor; because they shall all
   know me, from the least unto the greatest,"
   (Jeremiah 31:34.)

   And in these words Peter inviteth the Jews, unto whom he speaketh, to
   be partakers of the same grace. As if he should say, the Lord is ready
   to pour out that Spirit far and wide which he hath poured upon us.
   Therefore, unless you yourselves be the cause of let, ye shall receive
   with us of this fullness. And as for us, let us know that the same is
   spoken to us at this day which was then spoken to the Jews. For
   although those visible graces of the Spirit be ceased, yet God hath not
   withdrawn his Spirit from his Church. Wherefore he offereth him daily
   unto us all, by this same promise, without putting any difference.
   Wherefore we are poor and needy only through our own sluggishness; and
   also it appeareth manifestly, that those are wicked and sacrilegious
   enemies of the Spirit which keep back the Christian common people from
   the knowledge of God; and forasmuch as he himself doth not only admit,
   but also call by name unto himself, women and men, young and old.

   18. Upon my servants. In these words the promise is restrained unto the
   worshippers of God. For God doth not profane his Spirit; which he
   should do, if he should make the stone common to the unbelieving and
   despisers. It is certain that we are made the servants of God by the
   Spirit; and that, therefore, we are not, until such time as we have
   received the same; but, first, whom God hath adopted to be of his
   family, and whom he hath framed by his Spirit to obey him, those doth
   he furnish with new gifts afterward. Again, the prophet did not respect
   that order of thee, but his meaning was to make this grace proper to
   the Church alone. And forasmuch as the Church was only among the Jews,
   he calleth them honorably the servants and handmaids of God. But after
   that God did gather unto himself on every side a Church, the wall of
   separation being pulled down, so many as are received into the society
   of the covenant are called by the same name. Only let us remember, that
   the Spirit is appointed for the Church properly.

   19. And I will show wonders We must first see what is meant by this
   great day of the Lord. Some do expound it of the former coming of
   Christ in the flesh; and others refer it unto the last day of the
   resurrection, I do allow neither opinion. For, in my judgment, the
   prophet comprehendeth the whole kingdom of Christ. And so he calleth it
   the great day, after that the Son of God began to be revealed in the
   flesh, that he may lead us into the fulfilling of his kingdom.
   Therefore, he appointeth no certain day, but he beginneth this day at
   the first preaching of the gospel, and he extendeth the same unto the
   last resurrection. Those which restrain it unto the time of the
   apostles are moved with this reason, because the prophet joineth this
   member and that which goeth next before together. But in that there is
   no absurdity at all, because the prophet doth assign the time when
   these things began to come to pass, howsoever they have a continual
   going forward even until the end of the world. Furthermore, whereas he
   saith that the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon into
   blood, they are figurative speeches, whereby he doth give us to
   understand thus much, that the Lord will show tokens of his wrath
   through the whole frame of the world, which shall bring men even to
   their wit's end, as if there should be some horrible and fearful change
   of nature wrought. For as the sun and moon are unto us witnesses of
   God's fatherly favor towards us, whilst that by course they give light
   to the earth; so, on the other side, the prophet saith, that they shall
   be messengers to foreshow God's wrath and displeasure. And this is the
   second member of the prophecy. For after that he had intreated of the
   spiritual grace which should be abundantly poured out upon all flesh,
   lest any man should imagine that all things should be quiet and
   prosperous together, therewithal he addeth that the estate of the world
   shall be troublesome, and full of great fear under Christ; as Christ
   himself doth more fully declare, Matthew 24 and Luke 21.

   But this serveth greatly to the setting forth of grace, that whereas
   all things do threaten destruction, yet whosoever doth call upon the
   name of the Lord is sure to be saved. By the darkness of the sun, by
   the bloody streaming of the moon, by the black vapor of smoke, the
   prophet meant to declare, that whithersoever men turn their eyes, there
   shall many things appear, both upward and downward, which may make them
   amazed and afraid, as he hath already said. Therefore, this is as much
   as if he should have said, that the world was never in a more miserable
   case, that there were never so many and such cruel tokens of God's
   wrath. Hence may we gather how inestimable the goodness of God is, who
   offereth a present remedy for so great evils; and again, how unthankful
   they are towards God, and how froward, which do not flee unto the
   sanctuary of salvation, which is nigh unto them, and doth meet them.
   Again, it is out of all doubt, that God meaneth by this so doleful a
   description, to stir up all godly men, that they may with a more
   fervent desire seek for salvation. And Peter citeth it to the same end,
   that the Jews may know that they shall be more miserable unless they
   receive that grace of the Spirit which is offered unto them. Yet here
   may a question be asked, how this can hang together, that when Christ
   is revealed, there should such a sea of miseries overflow and break out
   therewithal? For it may seem to be a thing very inconvenient, [98] that
   he should be the only pledge of God's love toward mankind, in whom the
   heavenly Father doth lay open all the treasure of his goodness, yea, he
   poureth out the bowels of his mercy upon us, and that yet, by the
   coming of the same, his Son, his wrath should be more hot than it was
   wont, so that it should, as it were, quite consume both heaven and
   earth at once.

   But we must first mark, that because men are too slow to receive
   Christ, they must be constrained by divers afflictions, as it were with
   whips. Secondly, forasmuch as Christ doth call unto himself all those
   which are heavy laden and labor, (Matthew 11:28,) we must first be
   tamed by many miseries, that we may learn humility. For through great
   prosperity men do set up the horns of pride. And he cannot but despise
   Christ fiercely, whosoever he be, that seemeth to himself to be happy.
   Thirdly, because we are, more than we ought, set upon the seeking of
   the peace of the flesh, whereby it cometh to pass that many tie the
   grace of Christ unto the present life, it is expedient for us to be
   accustomed to think otherwise, that we may know that the kingdom of
   Christ is spiritual. Therefore, to the end God may teach us that the
   good things of Christ are heavenly, he doth exercise us, according to
   the flesh, with many miseries; whereby it cometh to pass that we do
   seek our felicity without the world. Moreover, men do bring miseries
   upon themselves through their unthankfulness; for the servant which
   knoweth his master's will, and doth not obey, is worthy of greater and
   more stripes, (Luke 12:47.) The more familiarly that God doth
   communicate with us in Christ, the more doth our ungodliness grow and
   break out into open contumacy, so that it is no marvel if, when Christ
   is revealed, there appear many tokens of God's vengeance on the other
   side, forasmuch as men do hereby more grievously provoke God against
   them, and kindle his wrath through wicked contempt. Surely, in that the
   day of Christ is fearful, it is an accidental thing; whether God will
   correct our slothfulness, to bring us under, which [who] are yet inapt
   to be taught, or whether he will punish our unthankfulness. For it
   bringeth with it of itself nothing but that which is pleasant; but the
   contempt of God's grace doth provoke him to horrible anger not without
   cause.

   21. Whosoever shall call upon An excellent place. For as God doth prick
   us forward like sluggish asses, with threatenings and terrors to seek
   salvation, se, after that he hath brought darkness upon the face of
   heaven and earth, yet doth he show a means whereby salvation may shine
   before our eyes, to wit, if we shall call upon him. For we must
   diligently note this circumstance. If God should promise salvation
   simply, it were a great matter; but it is a far greater when as he
   promiseth the same amidst manifold dungeons of death. Whilst that
   (saith he) all things shall be out of order, and the fear of
   destruction shall possess all things, only call upon me, and ye shall
   be saved. Therefore, howsoever man be swallowed up ill the gulf of
   miseries, yet is there set before him a way to escape. We must also
   note the universal word, whosoever For God admitteth all men unto
   himself without exception, and by this means doth he invite them to
   salvation, as Paul gathereth in the tenth chapter to the Romans, and as
   the prophet had set it down before,

   "Thou, Lord, which hearest the prayer,
   unto thee shall all flesh come,"
   (Psalm 65:2.)

   Therefore, forasmuch as no man is excluded from calling upon God, the
   gate of salvation is set open unto all men; neither is there any other
   thing which keepeth us back from entering in, save only our own
   unbelief. I speak of all unto whom God doth make himself manifest by
   the gospel. But like as those which call upon the name of the Lord are
   sure of salvation, so we must think that, without the same, we are
   thrice miserable and undone. And when as our salvation is placed in
   calling upon God, there is nothing in the mean season taken from faith,
   forasmuch as this invocation is grounded on faith alone. There is also
   another circumstance no less worthy the noting; in that the prophet
   doth signify, that the calling upon God doth properly appertain and
   agree unto the last days. For although he would be called upon in all
   ages, notwithstanding, since that he showed himself to be a Father in
   Christ, we have the more easy access unto him. Which thing ought both
   the more to embolden us, and to take from us all sluggishness. As he
   himself doth also reason, that by this privilege our forwardness to
   pray is doubled to us: "Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name; ask,
   and ye shall receive;" as if he should say, theretofore, although I did
   not yet appear to be a mediator and advocate in the faith, yet did ye
   pray; but now, when you shall have me to be your patron, with how much
   more courage ought ye to do that?

   Acts 2:22-24

   22. Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man showed
   towards you of God, by powers and wonders, and signs, which God did by
   him in the midst of you, as you yourselves know: 23. Him, I say, have
   ye taken, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
   of God, by the hands of wicked men, and have slain him, having fastened
   him to the cross. 24. Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the
   sorrows of death, forasmuch as it was impossible that he should be
   holden of it.


   22. Jesus of Nazareth Now doth Peter apply unto his purpose the
   prophecy of Joel; namely, that the Jews may thereby know that the time
   of restoring was present; and that Christ was given them for this
   purpose. For this promise was no otherwise to be fulfilled, save only
   by the coming of the Mediator. And this is the right use of all those
   gifts which we have by Christ, whilst that they bring us unto Christ,
   as unto a fountain. But he cometh hither by little and little. For he
   doth not by and by in the beginning affirm that Jesus was Christ; but
   he saith only that he was a man sent of God; and that doth he prove by
   his miracles. Afterward he addeth, that he rose from death when he was
   slain. Whereby it appeareth more certainly and more fully that he was
   not one of the prophets, but the very Son of God, who was promised to
   be the repairer of all things. Let this, therefore, be the first
   member, that Jesus of Nazareth was a man approved of God by manifest
   testimonies, so that he could not be despised as some base and obscure
   person. The old interpreter did not evil [99] translate hupodedeigmenon
   approved. And Erasmus is deceived, who thinketh that he did read it
   otherwise; and he himself did not express Luke's mind, when as he
   translated it given. [100] For, seeing that word doth signify among the
   Grecians to show, whereupon the mathematicians also call those
   arguments whereby they set a thing, as it were, before a man's eyes,
   apodeixeis, or demonstrations, Luke meant to say, that Jesus came not
   unknown, and without any testimony or approbation, but that those
   miracles which God showed by him served to this end, that he might be
   famous and excellent. Therefore he saith that he was showed toward the
   Jews; because God would have his Son to be accounted excellent and
   great among them; as if he should say, that miracles were not appointed
   for other nations, but for the Jews, that they might know that Jesus
   was sent unto them of God.

   By great works. He calleth miracles by these three names. And because
   God doth show forth his power in them after a new and unwonted sort, or
   doth, at least, procure greater admiration, they are, for good causes,
   called great works. [101] For we are commonly more moved when any
   extraordinary thing doth happen. In which respect they are also called
   wonders, [102] because they make us astonished. And for this cause are
   they called signs, because the Lord will not have men's minds to stay
   there, but to be lifted up higher; as they are referred unto another
   end. He put in three words, to the end he might the more extol Christ's
   miracles, and enforce the people, by his heaping and laying of words
   together, to consider the same. Furthermore, he maketh not Christ the
   chief author, but only the minister; because, as we have already said,
   he determined to go forward by degrees. Notwithstanding, here may a
   question be asked, whether miracles do suffice to be a sufficient and
   just approbation [proof] or no? Because by this means inchanters might
   cause their legerdemain [103] to be believed. I answer, that the
   juggling casts of Satan do much differ from the power of God. Christ
   saith elsewhere, that the kingdom of Antichrist shall be in wonders,
   but he addeth by and by, in lying wonders, (2 Thessalonians 2:9.) if
   any man object, that we cannot easily discern, because he saith that
   they shall have so great color that they shall deceive (if it could be)
   the very elect; I answer again, that this error proceedeth only from
   our own want of wit, because we are so dull; for God doth show his
   power manifestly enough. Therefore, there is sufficient approbation of
   the doctrine and of the ministry in the miracles which God doth work,
   so that we be not blind. And whereas it is not of sufficient force
   among the wicked, because they may now and then be deceived with the
   false miracles of Satan, this must be imputed unto their own blindness;
   but whosoever hath a pure heart, he doth also know God with the pure
   eyes of his mind, so often as he doth show himself. Neither can Satan
   otherwise delude us, save only when, through the wickedness of our
   heart, our judgment is corrupt and our eyes blinded, or at least
   bleared through our own slothfulness.

   23. Him have ye slain. He maketh mention of the death of Christ for
   this cause chiefly, that the resurrection might the more assuredly be
   believed. It was a thing full well known among the Jews that Christ was
   crucified. Therefore, in that he rose again, it is a great and
   wonderful token of his Divine power. In the mean season, to the end he
   may prick their consciences with the feeling of sin, he saith that they
   slew him; not that they crucified him with their own hands, but because
   the people, with one voice, desired to have him put to death. And
   although many of the hearers unto whom he speaketh did not consent unto
   that wicked and ungodly cruelty, yet doth he justly impute the same to
   the nation; because all of them had defiled themselves either with
   their silence, or else through their carelessness. Neither hath the
   cloak and color [104] of ignorance any place, forasmuch as he was
   showed before of God. This guiltiness, therefore, under which he
   bringeth them, is a preparation unto repentance.

   By the determinate counsel He removeth a stumbling-block; because it
   seemeth, at the first blush, to be a thing very inconvenient,
   [unaccountable,] that that man whom God had so greatly adorned, being
   afterward laid open to all manner of mocking, doth suffer so
   reproachful a death. Therefore, because the cross of Christ doth
   commonly use to trouble us at the first sight, for this cause Peter
   declareth that he suffered nothing by chance, or because he wanted
   power to deliver himself, but because it was so determined (and
   appointed) by God. For this knowledge alone, that the death of Christ
   was ordained by the eternal counsel of God, did cut off all occasion of
   foolish and wicked cogitation's, and did prevent all offenses which
   might otherwise be conceived. For we must know this, that God doth
   decree nothing in vain or rashly; whereupon it followeth that there was
   just cause for which he would have Christ to suffer. The same knowledge
   of God's providence is a step to consider the end and fruit of Christ's
   death. For this meeteth us by and by in the counsel of God, that the
   just was delivered [105] for our sins, and that his blood was the price
   of our death.

   And here is a notable place touching the providence of God, that we may
   know that as well our life as our death is governed by it. Luke
   intreateth, indeed, of Christ; but in his person we have a mirror,
   which doth represent unto us the universal providence of God, which
   doth stretch itself throughout the whole world; yet doth it specially
   shine unto us who are the members of Christ. Luke setteth down two
   things in this place, the foreknowledge and the decree of God. And
   although the foreknowledge of God is former in order, (because God doth
   first see what he will determine, before he doth indeed determine the
   same,) yet doth he put the same after the counsel and decree of God, to
   the end we may know that God would nothing, neither appointed anything,
   save that which he had long before directed to his [its] end. For men
   do oftentimes rashly decree many things, because they decree them
   suddenly. Therefore, to the end Peter may teach that the counsel of God
   is not without reason, he coupleth also therewithal his foreknowledge.
   Now, we must distinguish these two, and so much the more diligently,
   because many are deceived in this point. For passing over the counsel
   of God, wherewith he doth (guide and) govern the whole world, they
   catch at his bare foreknowledge. Thence cometh that common distinction,
   that although God doth foresee all things, yet doth he lay no necessity
   upon his creatures. And, indeed, it is true that God doth know this
   thing or that thing before, for this cause, because it shall come to
   pass; but as we see that Peter doth teach that God did not only foresee
   that which befell Christ, but it was decreed by him. And hence must be
   gathered a general doctrine; because God doth no less show his
   providence in governing the whole world, than in ordaining and
   appointing the death of Christ. Therefore, it belongeth to God not only
   to know before things to come, but of his own will to determine what he
   will have done. This second thing did Peter declare when he said, that
   he was delivered by the certain and determinate counsel of God.
   Therefore, the foreknowledge of God is another thing than the will of
   God, whereby he governeth and ordereth all things.

   Some, which are of quicker sight, confess that God doth not only
   foreknow, but also govern with his beck what things soever are done in
   this world. Nevertheless, they imagine a confused government, as if God
   did give liberty to his creatures to follow their own nature. They say
   that the sun is ruled by the will of God, because, in giving light to
   us, he doth his duty, which was once enjoined him by God. They think
   that man hath free-will after this sort left him, because his nature is
   disposed or inclined unto the free choice of good and evil. But they
   which think so do feign that God sitteth idle in heaven. The Scripture
   teacheth us far otherwise, which ascribeth unto God a special
   government in all things, and in man's actions. Notwithstanding, it is
   our duty to ponder and consider to what end it teacheth this; for we
   must beware of doting speculations, wherewith we see many carried away.
   The Scripture will exercise our faith, that we may know that we are
   defended by the hand of God, lest we be subject to the injuries of
   Satan and the wicked. It is good for us to embrace this one thing;
   neither did Peter mean anything else in this place. Yea, we have an
   example set before us in Christ, whereby we may learn to be wise with
   sobriety. For it is out of question, that his flesh was subject to
   corruption, according to nature. But the providence of God did set the
   same free. If any man ask, whether the bones of Christ could be broken
   or no? it is not to be denied, that they were subject to breaking
   naturally, yet could there no bone be broken, because God had so
   appointed and determined, (John 19:36.) By this example (I say) we are
   taught so to give the chiefest room to God's providence, that we keep
   ourselves within our bounds, and that we thrust not ourselves rashly
   and indiscreetly into the secrets of God, whither our eyesight doth not
   pierce.

   By the hands of the wicked Because Peter seemeth to grant that the
   wicked did obey God, hereupon followeth two absurdities; [106] the one,
   either that God is the author of evil, or that men do not sin, what
   wickedness soever they commit. I answer, concerning the second, that
   the wicked do nothing less than obey God, howsoever they do execute
   that which God hath determined with himself. For obedience springeth
   from a voluntary affection; and we know that the wicked have a far
   other purpose. Again, no man obeyeth God save he which knoweth his
   will. Therefore, obedience dependeth upon the knowledge of God's will.
   Furthermore, God hath revealed unto us his will in the law; wherefore,
   those men [107] do obey God, who do that alone which is agreeable to
   the law of God; and, again, which submit themselves willingly to his
   government. We see no such thing in all the wicked, whom God doth drive
   hither and thither, they themselves being ignorant. No man, therefore,
   will say that they are excusable under this color, because they obey
   God; forasmuch as both the will of God must be sought in his law, and
   they, so much as in them lieth, do [108] to resist God. As touching the
   other point, I deny that God is the author of evil; because there is a
   certain noting of a wicked affection in this word. For the wicked deed
   is esteemed according to the end whereat a man aimeth. When men commit
   theft or murder, they offend [109] for this cause, because they are
   thieves or murderers; and in theft and murder there is a wicked
   purpose. God, who useth their wickedness, is to be placed in the higher
   degree. For he hath respect unto a far other thing, because he will
   chastise the one, and exercise the patience of the other; and so he
   doth never decline from his nature, that is, from perfect
   righteousness. So that, whereas Christ was delivered by the hands of
   wicked men, whereas he was crucified, it came to pass by the
   appointment and ordinance of God. But treason, which is of itself
   wicked, and murder, which hath in it so great wickedness, must not be
   thought to be the works of God.

   24. Having loosed the sorrows of death. By the sorrows of death I
   understand some farther thing than the bodily sense or feeling. For
   those which duly consider the nature of death, because they hear that
   it is the curse of God, must needs conceive that God is angry in death.
   Hence cometh marvelous horror, wherein there is greater misery than in
   death itself. Furthermore, Christ died upon this occasion that he might
   take upon him our guiltiness. That inward fear of conscience, which
   made him so afraid that he sweat blood when he presented himself before
   the throne and tribunal seat of God, did more vex him, and brought upon
   him greater horror, than all the torments of the flesh. And whereas
   Peter saith, that Christ did wrestle with such sorrows, and doth also
   declare that he had the victory, by this it cometh to pass that the
   faithful ought not now to be afraid of death; for death hath not the
   like quality now which was in Adam; because by the victory of Christ
   the curse is swallowed up, (1 Corinthians 15:54.) We feel, indeed, yet
   the pricking of sorrows, but such as do not wholly wound us, whilst
   that we hold up the buckler of faith against them. He added a reason,
   because it was impossible that Christ should be oppressed by death, who
   is the author of life.

   Acts 2:25-31

   25. For David saith of him, I saw the Lord before me always, because he
   is on my right hand; lest I should be moved. 26. For this my heart
   rejoiced, and my tongue was glad; moreover, my flesh shall rest in
   hope: 27. Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt
   thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption. 28. Thou hast made known
   unto me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me with gladness with thy
   face. 29. Men and brethren, seeing that I may boldly speak unto you of
   the patriarch David, because he is both dead and buried, and his
   sepulcher remaineth with us until this day. 30. Therefore, seeing he
   was a prophet, and did know that God had sworn unto him with an oath
   that it should come to pass, that Christ should rise of the fruits of
   his loins, concerning the flesh, who should sit upon his throne; 31. He
   knowing this before, spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul
   was not left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.


   25. The resurrection, [110] which was both declared and witnessed by
   certain and evident testimonies, and which might also have been
   gathered out of the continual doctrine of the prophets, was to be
   proved to the Jews as some new and strange thing. And no marvel. For we
   see that although Christ had oftentimes beat [111] the same into his
   disciples' heads, yet did they profit but a little. And yet did they
   retain certain principles of true doctrine, which might have made a way
   for them unto the knowledge of Christ, as we shall see by and by.
   Therefore, because the gift of the Spirit was a fruit of the
   resurrection of Christ, he proveth by the testimony of David that
   Christ must needs have risen again, that the Jews may thereby know that
   he was the author of the gift. For he taketh it as a thing which all
   men grant, that he was raised up from death, that he may live not for
   himself, but for his. Now we see Peter's drift; that that ought to seem
   no strange thing which was foretold so long before; and that Jesus is
   also Christ, because David did prophecy of him, as of the tied of the
   Church.

   First of all, we must see whether this place ought altogether to be
   understood of Christ, as Peter affirmeth; that done, if there be any
   thing in the words worth noting, we will in order discuss it. Peter
   denieth that that agreeth with David which is said in this place:

   "Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption,"
   (Psalm 16:10,)

   because David's carcass was corrupt in the grave. It seemeth at the
   first blush to be but a light argument. For a man might easily object,
   that the word is not to be urged, forasmuch as David meant nothing
   else, save only to exempt himself from destruction. Therefore,
   howsoever corruption did touch him, yet doth that no whit hinder but
   that he may easily say that he was safe from the danger thereof,
   because he knew that the Lord would deliver him. Yea, it seemeth to be
   a repetition of the former sentence, according to the common custom of
   the Hebrew tongue. Which if it be so, the sense shall be plain, that
   God will not suffer him to be oppressed with death, or that death
   should consume him. And this interpretation is confirmed by that where
   we read hell, it is in Hebrew sl, (seol;) where we read corruption,
   there it is scht, (shachat;) both these words do signify the grave. By
   this means David should say twice, that he shall be delivered from
   death by the grace of God. Finally, he saith the same thing in this
   place, which he saith, (Psalm 49:15,) "God shall redeem my soul from
   the hand of hell." Like as, on the other side, when he speaketh of the
   reprobates, he is wont to take "going down into the grave" for
   destruction. I answer briefly, that there is some greater thing
   expressed in this place than the common redemption or deliverance of
   the godly. David, indeed, doth promise that God will be his eternal
   deliverer, as well in life as in death. Neither had he been much better
   for this, to have been once delivered from one danger, unless he had
   hoped that he should be safe even unto the end through God's
   protection; but he speaketh of such safety as is not common. [112] And
   surely the words do sound that he speaketh of some new and singular
   privilege. Admit I grant that it is a repetition, and that there is all
   one thing uttered in these two members, "Thou shalt not leave my soul
   in hell;" and, "Thou shalt not suffer me to see corruption;" yet do I
   deny that it is simply to be understood that God will deliver his Holy
   One from eternal destruction; for freedom from corruption is promised
   by name. Neither do I pass for this, that scht (shachat) doth signify
   the grave, as sl, (seol,) which is put in the former member. For
   although I do not stand nor contend about the words, yet must we
   respect the etymology. Therefore, forasmuch as the grave is called
   scht, (shachat) because it doth corrupt man's body with rottenness, it
   is not to be doubted but that David meant to note that quality.
   Therefore, the place is not so much expressed by this word, as the
   condition of rotting. So that the sense is, that God will not suffer
   him of whom the Psalm speaketh "to rot or corrupt in the grave." And
   forasmuch as David was not free from this necessity, it followeth that
   the prophecy was neither truly nor perfectly fulfilled in him.

   And that the Psalm ought altogether to be expounded of Christ, the
   thing itself doth prove. For seeing that David was one of the sons of
   Adam, he could not escape that universal condition and estate of
   mankind,

   "Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return,"
   (Genesis 3:19;)

   the grave standeth open (I say) for all the children of Adam, that it
   may swallow them up, and consume them; so that no man can exempt
   himself from corruption. So that, beholding ourselves apart from
   Christ, we see the grave prepared for us, which threateneth to us
   corruption. Wherefore, if David be separated from Christ, that shall
   not belong to him which is here said, that he shall be preserved from
   the grave. Therefore, when he boasteth that he shall be free from the
   grave, as touching corruption, without all doubt he placeth himself in
   the body of Christ, wherein death was overcome, and the kingdom thereof
   abolished. But and if David do promise himself exempting from the grave
   in another respect, save only so far forth as he is a member of Christ,
   hereby it appeareth that this freedom must begin at Christ as at the
   head. What man soever shall be of sound judgment shall easily know that
   this is a good argument. God did put all mankind under corruption;
   therefore, David, inasmuch as he was of the number of men, could not be
   free from the same. Neither is it to be doubted, but that the Jews,
   before whom this sermon was made, forasmuch as without question that
   maxim was of force amongst them, that they were to hope for the
   restoring of things at the hands of Christ alone, did the more readily
   stay themselves upon [113] the words of Peter; because they saw that
   that could no otherwise be which the words do import, unless they
   should apply it to the Messias. For they were not come to that point of
   impudence, at least those of whom mention is made here, that they durst
   cavil in matters which were evident; for God had then offered unto his
   disciples those which were godly hearers, and apt to be taught. They
   sought the Messias in the Old Testament. They knew that David was a
   figure of him. There was amongst them some religion and reverence of
   the Scriptures then; but now the impudency of all the whole nation
   almost is desperate. Howsoever they be urged, they wrench themselves
   out one way or other. [114] Where there is no way to escape, yet they
   break through; although they be overcome, yet will they not yield;
   neither is it to be doubted but that this their shameless forwardness
   is a punishment for their ungodliness. But let us return unto Peter's
   sermon.

   Seeing that David doth not only affirm that God also shall be his
   deliverer, but doth express a singular way and means; namely, that he
   shall not be subject to the corruption of the grave, Peter doth for
   good causes gather, that that doth not properly appertain unto him, for
   that his body was corrupt in the grave. And now, because this had been
   somewhat hard to be spoken among the Jews, he mollifieth the hardness
   with a circumlocution. For he doth not flatly deny in one word that
   that was fulfilled indeed in David, but doth only by the way [115]
   signify so much unto them, because he lieth consumed in the grave after
   the common custom of other men. And David did so prophesy of Christ,
   that he did both apply this consolation unto himself privately, and'
   also extend the same unto the whole body of the Church. For that which
   is sound and perfect in the head is spread abroad, being afterward
   poured out into all the members. Neither is it to be denied but that
   David spoke of himself in this place; yet only so far forth as he
   beheld himself in Christ, as in the mirror of life. First, he hath
   respect unto Christ; after that he turneth his eyes toward himself, and
   others the faithful. So that we have a general doctrine prescribed unto
   us in this plate, concerning the nature of faith, the spiritual joy of
   conscience: and the hope of eternal deliverance.

   I saw We must hold this principle. If we will have God present with us,
   we must set him before our eyes; and that before he do appear; for the
   prospect of faith pierceth far further than unto the present
   experience. Therefore faith hath this property, to set God always
   before it as a guide in all dangers and confused matters. For there is
   nothing that doth so much hold us up, as when we know that God is
   present with us; as the opinion of his absence doth often cast us down,
   and at length quite discourage us. David addeth, That he took not heed
   in vain unto the direction of God. "He is (saith he) at my right hand;"
   whereby he doth signify that we need not to fear lest we be deceived,
   [116] when as we set him before us at present; for we shall always feel
   his help most ready. Faith, in hoping for the help of God, ought to
   prevent and overgo [117] all experience, and whatsoever is perceived by
   the sense; but so soon as it shall give this glory to God, that it doth
   behold him in his Word, although he be absent, and so, consequently,
   invisible, it shall be overcome with the effect of the thing. For the
   measure of faith is not able to comprehend the infinite greatness of
   the power and goodness of God. He draweth a similitude from those
   which, when they will underprop the weak, or strengthen the fearful, do
   join themselves unto their side. Not to be moved, is not to be thrown
   down from their degree, but to remain firm in their estate; like as
   also Psalm 46:5, God is in the midst of it, therefore shall it not be
   moved. For although it come to pass sometimes that the godly be sore
   shaken, yet because they come to themselves again, they are said to
   continue firm. Therefore, there is no cause why they should be afraid
   of falling, who are upholden by the help of God. Like as, on the other
   side, those which place their strength anywhere else save only in God,
   they shall be like to fall at every blast of wind, but at any mean wind
   of temptation they shall fall to the ground.

   26. For this my heart rejoiced Joy of the soul, gladness of the tongue,
   and quietness of all the whole body, do ensue upon sure hope and
   confidence; for unless men be quite past feeling, [118] they must needs
   be careful and sorrowful, and so, consequently, miserably tormented, so
   long as they feel themselves destitute of the help of God. But that
   sure trust which we repose in God doth not only deliver us from
   carefulness, [119] but doth also replenish our hearts with wonderful
   joy (and gladness.) That is the joy which Christ promised to his
   disciples should be full in them, and which he testified could not be
   taken from them, (John 16:22; 17:13.) He expresseth the greatness of
   the joy when he saith, That it cannot be kept in, but that it will
   break forth into the gladness of the tongue. [120] kvvd, doth signify,
   indeed, glory, but it is taken in that place, as in many others, for
   the tongue And so the Grecians have truly translated the same. The rest
   of the flesh doth signify the quietness of the whole man, which we have
   through the protection of God. Neither is this any let, because the
   faithful are continually out of quiet and tremble; for as in the midst
   of sorrows they do nevertheless rejoice; so there are no troubles so
   great that can break them of their rest. If any man object, that the
   peace of the faithful doth consist in the spirit, and that it is not in
   the flesh: I answer, that the faithful do rest in body; not that they
   are free from troubles, but because they believe that God careth for
   them wholly, and that not only their soul shall be safe through his
   protection, but their body also.

   27. Because thou shalt not leave To leave the soul in hell is to suffer
   the same to be oppressed with destruction. There be two words used in
   this place, both which do signify the grave amongst the Hebricians.
   Because s'vl, doth signify to require, I suppose it is called svl,
   because death is insatiable; whence also cometh that translation, Hell
   hath enlarged her soul. Again, they set open their mouth like hell. And
   because the latter scht, is derived and set for corruption, or
   consumption, that quality is to be considered, as David meant to note
   the same. Those things which are disputed in this place by divers,
   concerning the descending of Christ into hell, are in my judgment
   superfluous; because they are far from the intent and purpose of the
   prophet. For the word anima, or soul, doth not so much signify the
   spirit being of an immortal essence as the life itself. For when a man
   is dead, and lieth in the grave, the grave is said to rule over his
   life. Whereas the Grecians translate it holy, it is in Hebrew chst,
   which doth properly signify meek, or gentle, but Luke did not much
   regard this, because it doth not much appertain unto the present
   purpose. Furthermore, gentleness and meekness is so often commended in
   the faithful, because it behoveth them to imitate and resemble the
   nature of their Father.

   28. Thou hast made known. He meaneth, that he was restored from death
   to life by the grace of God. For in that he was, as it were, a man
   raised from death to life, he acknowledgeth that it was a great good
   gift of God. This was in such sort fulfilled in Christ, that there
   wanted nothing unto perfection. As for the members they have their
   measure. Therefore Christ was far from corruption, that he may be the
   first-fruits of those which rise from death, (1 Corinthians 15:23.) We
   shall follow him in our order at length, but being first turned into
   dust, (1 Corinthians 15:42.) That which followeth, that he was filled
   with gladness, with the countenance of God, agreeth with that: Show us
   thy face, and we shall be safe. And, again, The light of thy
   countenance is showed upon us: thou hast put gladness in my heart. For
   it is only the pleasantness of God's countenance, which doth not only
   make us glad, but also quickens us; again, when the same is turned
   away, or troubled, we must needs faint.

   30. Therefore, seeing he was a prophet He showeth, by two reasons, that
   it is no marvel if David do speak of things that should come to pass
   long after his time; the former is, because he was a prophet. And we
   know that things to come, and such as are removed far from the
   knowledge of men, are revealed unto the prophets. Therefore, it were
   wickedness to measure their speeches according to the common manner and
   order which we use in measuring the speeches of other men, forasmuch as
   they go beyond the long courses of years, having the Spirit for their
   director. Whereupon they are also called seers; because being placed,
   as it were, upon an high tower, [121] they see those things which, by
   reason of great distance, are hidden from other men. Another reason is,
   because Christ was promised to him peculiarly. This maxim was so common
   amongst the Jews, that they had ever now and then the son of David in
   their mouth, so often as there was any mention made of Christ. They be
   no such arguments, I confess, as do necessarily prove that this
   prophecy is to be expounded of Christ; neither was that Peter's intent
   and purpose; but first he meant to prevent the contrary objection,
   whence David had such skill to foretell a thing which was unknown.
   Therefore he saith, That he knew Christ, both by prophetical
   revelation, and also by singular promise. Furthermore, this principle
   was of great (Romans 10:4) force amongst the better-minded sort which
   Paul setteth down, that Christ is the end of the law. [122] No man,
   therefore, did doubt of this, but that this was the mark whereat all
   the prophets did aim, to lead the godly unto Christ as it were by the
   hand. Therefore, what notable or extraordinary thing soever they did
   utter, the Jews were commonly persuaded that it did agree with Christ.
   Furthermore, we must note, that Peter doth reason soundly, when he
   gathered that David was not ignorant of that which was the chiefest
   point of all revelations.

   He had sworn with an oath God swore not only to the end he might make
   David believe his promise, but also that the thing promised might be
   had in greater estimation. And to this end, in my judgment, it is here
   repeated, that the Jews may think with themselves of what great weight
   the promise was, which God did make so notable (and so famous.) The
   same admonition is profitable for us also. For we need not to doubt of
   this, but that the Lord meant to set forth the excellency of the
   covenant by putting in a solemn oath. In the mean season, this is also
   a fit remedy for the infirmity of our faith, that the sacred name of
   God is set forth unto us, [123] that his words may carry the greater
   credit. These words, "according to the flesh," do declare that there
   was some more noble thing in Christ than the flesh. Therefore Christ
   did so come of the seed of David as he was man, that he doth
   nevertheless, retain his divinity; and so the distinction between the
   two natures is plainly expressed; when as Christ is called the Son of
   God, according to his eternal essence, in like sort as he is called the
   seed of David according to the flesh.

   Acts 2:32-36

   32. This Jesus hath God raised up; whereof we all are witnesses. 33. He
   being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received
   the promise of the Holy Ghost of the Father, he hath now shed forth
   that which ye now see and hear. 34. For David is not ascended into
   heaven: But he saith, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
   35. Until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 36. Therefore, let all
   the house of Israel know for a surety, that God hath made this Jesus
   Lord, and the same Christ, whom ye have crucified.


   32. This Jesus After that he had proved by the testimony of David, that
   it was most requisite that Christ should rise again, he saith, that he
   and the rest of his fellows were such witnesses as saw him with their
   eyes after his resurrection. For this text [124] will not suffer this
   word raised up to be drawn into any other sense. Whereupon it followeth
   that that was fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth which David did foreshow
   concerning Christ. After that he intreateth of the fruit or effect. For
   it was requisite for him to declare that first, that Christ is alive.
   Otherwise it had been an absurd and incredible thing that he should be
   the author of so great a miracle. Notwithstanding he doth therewithal
   teach us, that he did not rise for his own sake alone, but that he
   might make the whole Church partaker of his life, having poured out the
   Spirit.

   33. He being therefore exalted by the right hand of God The right hand
   is taken in this place for the hand or power, in like sort as it is
   taken everywhere in the Scripture. For this is his drift, to declare
   that it was a wonderful work of God, in that he had exalted his Christ
   (whom men thought to be quite destroyed by death) unto so great glory.

   The promise of the Spirit for the Spirit which was promised. For he had
   oftentimes before promised the Spirit to his apostles. Therefore Peter
   doth signify, that Christ had obtained power of God the Father to
   fulfill the same. And he maketh mention of the promise in plain words,
   to the end the Jews may know that this came not to pass suddenly, but
   that the words of the prophet were now verified, which went long time
   before the thing itself.

   Furthermore, whereas it is said that he obtained it of the Father, it
   is to be applied to the person of the Mediator. For both these are
   truly said, that Christ sent the Spirit from himself and from the
   Father. He sent him from himself, because he is eternal God; from the
   Father, because in as much as he is man, he receiveth that of the
   Father which he giveth us. And Peter speaketh wisely according to the
   capacity of the ignorant, lest any man should move a question out of
   season concerning the power of Christ. And surely forasmuch as it is
   the office of Christ to direct us unto his Father, this is a most apt
   form of speaking for the use of godliness, that Christ being placed, as
   it were, in the midst between God and us, doth deliver unto us with his
   own hand those gifts which he hath received at the hands of his Father.
   Furthermore, we must note this order that he saith, that the Spirit was
   sent by Christ after that he was exalted. This agreeth with those
   sentences:

   "The Spirit was not yet given,
   because Christ was not yet glorified,"
   (John 7:39.)

   And again,

   "Unless I go hence, the Spirit will not come,"
   (John 16:7.)

   Not because the Spirit began then first to be given, wherewith the holy
   fathers were endued since the beginning of the world; but because God
   did defer this more plentiful abundance of grace, until such time as he
   had placed Christ in his princely seat; which is signified by this word
   poured out, as we saw a little before. For by this means the force and
   fruit of Christ his death and resurrection is sealed; and we do also
   thereby know, that we have lost nothing by Christ his departing out of
   the world; because, though he be absent in body, yet is he present with
   us after a better sort, to wit, by the grace of his Holy Spirit.

   34. For doubtless David Although they might easily gather by the very
   effect which they saw with their eyes, that the principality was
   granted and given to Christ, yet to the end his glory may carry the
   greater credit, he proveth, by David his testimony, that it was so
   appointed in times past by God, that Christ should be lifted up unto
   the highest degree of honor. For these words, to "sit at the right hand
   of God," import as much as to bear the chief rule, as we shall
   afterward more at large declare. Yet before he reciteth the prophecy,
   he saith that it agreeth only to Christ. Therefore, to the end the
   sense may be more manifest, the sentence must thus run. David
   pronounceth that it was decreed by God that a king should sit at his
   right hand. But this doth not appertain unto David, who was never
   extolled unto so great dignity. Therefore lie speaketh this of Christ.
   Furthermore, that ought to have seemed no strange thing unto the Jews
   which was foretold by the oracle of the Holy Ghost. Hereby it appeareth
   in what sense Peter denieth that David ascended into heaven. He
   intreateth not in this place of the soul of David, whether it were
   received into blessed rest, and the heavenly dwelling or no; but the
   ascending into heaven comprehendeth under it those things which Paul
   teacheth in the Epistle to the Ephesians, (Ephesians 4:9), where he
   placeth Christ above all heavens, that he may fulfill all things.
   Wherefore the disputation concerning the estate of the dead is
   altogether superfluous in this place. For Peter goeth about to prove no
   other thing but this, that the prophecy concerning the sitting at the
   right hand of God was not fulfilled in David, and that, therefore, the
   truth thereof must be sought elsewhere. And forasmuch as it can be
   found nowhere else save only in Jesus Christ, it resteth that the Jews
   [125] do know that that is showed to them in Christ which was foretold
   them so long before. That is true, indeed, that David reigned, God
   being the author hereof, and, in some respect, he was God's vicegerent;
   yet not so that he might be above all creatures. Wherefore, this
   sitting agreeth to none, unless he excel and be above all the whole
   world.

   The Lord said unto my Lord. This is the most lawful manner of ruling,
   when as the king (or by what other title soever he be called) doth know
   that he is ordained of God, therefore David pronounceth that the
   commandment to reign was given unto Christ by name, (Psalm 110:1.) As
   if he should say, He took not the honor to himself rashly, but did only
   obey God when he commanded him, (Hebrews 5:5.) Now must we see whether
   Peter's reason be sound enough or no. He gathereth that the words
   concern Christ, because the sitting at the right hand of God doth not
   agree to David. It seemeth that this may be refuted, because David did
   reign by the peculiar commandment, name, and help of God; which is to
   sit at the right hand of God. But Peter taketh that for a thing which
   all men grant, which is true, and which I have already touched, that a
   greater and more royal government is here spoken of than that which
   David did enjoy. For howsoever he was God's vicegerent and did, as it
   were, represent his person in reigning, yet is this power far inferior
   to that, to sit even at the right side of God. For this is attributed
   to Christ, because he is placed above all principality, and above every
   name that is named, both in this world, and in the world to come,
   (Ephesians 1:21.) Seeing that David is far inferior to the angels, he
   doth possess no such place that he should be counted next to God. For
   he must ascend far above all heavens, that he may come to the right
   hand of God. Wherefore no man is said to sit at it, rightly and
   properly, save only he which doth surpass all creatures in the degree
   of honor. As for him which is resident amongst the creatures, although
   he be reckoned in the order of angels, yet is he far from that
   highness. Again, we must not seek the right hand of God amongst the
   creatures; but it doth also surpass all heavenly principalities.

   Furthermore, there is great weight even in the sentence itself. The
   king is commanded to bear the chiefest rule, until God have put all his
   enemies under his feet. Surely, although I grant that; he name of such
   an honorable sitting may be applied unto earthly lordship: yet do I
   deny that David did reign until such time as all his enemies were
   subdued. For we do hereby gather that the kingdom of Christ is eternal.
   But the kingdom of David was not only temporal, but also frail, and of
   a small continuance.

   Moreover, when David died, he left many enemies alive here and there he
   got many notable victories, but he was far from subduing all his
   enemies. He made many of those people which were round about him
   tributaries to him; some did he put to flight and destroyed; but what
   is all this unto all? Finally, we may prove by the whole text of the
   Psalm, that there can nothing else be understood save only the kingdom
   of Christ. That I may pass over other things: that which is here spoken
   touching the eternal priesthood is too far disagreeing from David's
   person. I know that the Jews do prattle, that kings' sons are called
   elsewhere cohenim. But he intreateth here of the priesthood as it is
   ascribed by Moses to the king Melchizedek. And there is established by
   a solemn oath a certain new kind of priesthood. And, therefore, we must
   not here imagine any common or ordinary thing. But it had been
   wickedness for David to thrust himself into any part of the priest's
   office. How should he then be called cohen, greater than Aaron, and
   consecrated of God for ever? But because I do not intend at this
   present to expound the whole Psalm, let this reason suffice which Peter
   bringeth: That he is made Lord of heaven and earth, which sitteth at
   the right hand of God. As touching the second member of the verse, read
   those things which I have noted upon the fifteenth chapter (1
   Corinthians 15:25) of the former Epistle to the Corinthians, concerning
   the putting of his enemies under his feet.

   36. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know The house of Israel did
   confess that that Christ should come which was promised; yet did they
   not know Who it was. Therefore, Peter concludeth, that Jesus: whom they
   had so spitefully handled, yea, whose name they did so greatly detest:
   is he whom they ought to acknowledge to be their Lord, and whom they
   ought to reverence. For, (saith he,) God hath made him Lord and Christ;
   that is, you must look for none other than him whom God hath made and
   given. Furthermore, he saith, That he was made, because God the Father
   gave him this honor. He joineth the title Lord with the word Christ,
   because it was a common thing among the Jews, that the Redeemer should
   be anointed upon this condition, that he might be the Head of the
   Church, and that the chiefest power over all things might be given him.
   He speaketh unto the whole house of Israel; as if he should say,
   Whosoever will be reckoned among the sons of Jacob, and do also look
   for the promise, let them know for a surety, that this is he and none
   other. He useth the word house, because God had separated that name and
   family from all other people. And he saith asphalos, or for a surety,
   not only that they may repose their sure confidence and trust in
   Christ, but that he may take away all occasion of doubting from those
   which do oftentimes willingly doubt even of matters which are certain
   and sure. In the end of his oration he upbraideth unto them again, that
   they did crucify him, that being touched with greater grief of
   conscience, they may desire remedy.

   And now, forasmuch as they know that Jesus is the Anointed of the Lord,
   the governor of the Church, and the giver of the Holy Ghost, the
   accusation hath so much the more force. For the putting of him to death
   was not only full of cruelty and wickedness, but also a testimony of
   outrageous disloyalty against God, of sacrilege and unthankfulness,
   and, finally, of apostasy. But it was requisite that they should be so
   wounded, lest they should have been slow to seek for medicine. And yet,
   notwithstanding, they did not crucify him with their own hands; but
   this is more than sufficient to make them guilty, in that they desired
   to have him put to death. And we also are accused by this same voice,
   if we crucify him in ourselves, being already glorified in heaven,
   making a mock of him, as saith the Apostle, (Hebrews 6:6.)

   Acts 2:37-39

   37. And when they heard these things, they were pricked in heart, and
   said unto Peter and to the other apostles, Men and brethren, what shall
   we do? 38. Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of
   you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye
   shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39. For the promise
   appertaineth unto you, and unto your children, and unto all which are
   far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.


   37. They were pricked in heart. Luke doth now declare the fruit of the
   sermon, to the end we may know that the power of the Holy Ghost was not
   only showed forth in the diversity of tongues, but also in their hearts
   which heard. And he noteth a double fruit; first, that they were
   touched with the feeling of sorrow; and, secondly, that they were
   obedient to Peter's counsel. This is the beginning of repentance, this
   is the entrance unto godliness, to be sorry for our sins, and to be
   wounded with the feeling of our miseries. For so long as men are
   careless, they cannot take such heed unto doctrine as they ought. And
   for this cause the word of God is compared to a sword, (Hebrews 4:12,)
   because it doth mortify our flesh, that we may be offered to God for a
   sacrifice. But there must be added unto this pricking in heart
   readiness to obey. Cain and Judas were pricked in heart, but despair
   did keep them back from submitting themselves unto God, (Genesis 4:13;
   Matthew 27:3.) For the mind being oppressed with horror, can do nothing
   else but flee from God. And surely when David affirmeth that a contrite
   spirit and an humble heart is a sacrifice acceptable to God, he
   speaketh of voluntary pricking; forasmuch as there is fretting and
   fuming mixed with the prickings of the wicked. Therefore, we must take
   a good heart to us, and lift up our mind with this hope of salvation,
   that we may be ready to addict and give over ourselves unto God, and to
   follow whatsoever he shall command. We see many oftentimes pricked,
   who, notwithstanding, do fret and murmur, or else forwardly strive and
   struggle, and so, consequently, go furiously mad. Yea, this is the
   cause why they go mad, because they feel such prickings against their
   will. Those men, therefore, are profitably pricked alone who are
   willingly sorrowful, and do also seek some remedy at God's hands.

   38. Peter said Hereby we see that those do never go away empty which
   ask at the mouth of the Lord, and do offer themselves unto him to be
   ruled and taught; for that promise must needs be true, Knock, and it
   shall be opened unto you, (Matthew 7:7.) Therefore, whosoever shall be
   rightly prepared to learn, the Lord will not suffer his godly desire to
   be in vain; for he is a most faithful master, so that he hath scholars
   which are apt to be taught and studious. Wherefore, there is no cause
   why he should fear, lest he suffer us to be destitute of sound counsel,
   if we be attentive and ready to hear him, and do not refuse to embrace
   whatsoever he shall teach us. And let us suffer ourselves to be
   governed by the counsel and authority of those men whom he offereth
   unto us to teach us, for this ready obedience cometh thence so suddenly
   in those which addict themselves unto the apostles, because they are
   persuaded that they are sent of God, to show them the way of salvation.

   Repent. There is greater force in the Greek word, for it doth signify
   the conversion of the mind, that the whole man may be renewed and made
   another man, which thing must be diligently noted, because this
   doctrine was miserably corrupted in the time of Popery; for they
   translated the name of repentance almost unto certain external rites.
   They babble somewhat, indeed, about the reigned contrition of the
   heart; but they touch that part very slightly, and they stand
   principally upon the external exercises of the body, which were little
   worth; yea, though there were in them no corruption; but they urge
   nothing else in a manner but reigned trifles, wherewith men are wearied
   in vain. Wherefore, let us know that this is the true repentance, when
   a man is renewed in the spirit of his mind, as Paul teacheth, (Romans
   12:2.) Neither need we to doubt of this; but that Peter did preach
   plainly of the force and nature of repentance; but Luke doth only touch
   the chief points, and doth not reckon up the words of the oration which
   he made. We must, therefore, know thus much, that Peter did at the
   first exhort the Jews unto repentance; and that done, he lifted them up
   with hope of pardon; for he promised them forgiveness of sins, which
   two things are the two parts of the gospel, as we know full well; and,
   therefore, when Christ will briefly teach what the doctrine of the
   gospel doth contain, he saith, that repentance and remission of sins
   (Luke 24:47) must be preached in his name. Furthermore, because we are
   reconciled unto God only by the intercession of Christ's death, neither
   are our sins otherwise purged, [126] and done away, save only by his
   blood, therefore, Peter calleth us back unto him by name. He putteth
   baptism in the fourth place, as the seal whereby the promise of grace
   is confirmed.

   Wherefore, we have in these few words almost the whole sum of
   Christianity, namely, how a man renouncing himself and taking his
   farewell of the world, may addict himself wholly to God; secondly, How
   he may be delivered by free forgiveness of sins, and so adopted into
   the number of the children of God. And forasmuch as we can obtain none
   of all these things without Christ, the name of Christ is therewithal
   set forth unto us, as the only foundation of faith and repentance. And
   we must also note this, that we do so begin repentance when we are
   turned unto God, that we must prosecute the same during our life;
   therefore, this sermon must continually sound in the Church, repent,
   (Mark 1:15;) not that those men may begin the same, who will be counted
   faithful, and have a place already in the Church; but that they may go
   forward in the same; although many do usurp the name of faithful men,
   which had never any beginning of repentance. Wherefore, we must observe
   this order in teaching, that those which do yet live unto the world and
   the flesh may begin to crucify the old man, that they may rise unto
   newness of life, and that those who are already entered the course of
   repentance may continually go forward towards the mark. Furthermore,
   because the inward conversion of the heart ought to bring forth fruits
   in the life, repentance cannot be rightly taught unless works be
   required, not those frivolous works which are only in estimation
   amongst the Papists, but such as are sound testimonies of innocence and
   holiness.

   Be baptized every one of you. Although in the text and order of the
   words, baptism doth here go before remission of sins, yet doth it
   follow it in order, because it is nothing else but a sealing of those
   good things which we have by Christ that they may be established in our
   consciences; therefore, after that Peter had intreated of repentance,
   he calleth the Jews unto the hope of grace and salvation; and,
   therefore, Luke well afterwards, in Paul's sermon, joineth faith and
   repentance together in the same sense, wherein he putteth forgiveness
   of sins in this place, and that for good considerations; for the hope
   of salvation consisteth in the free imputation of righteousness; and we
   are counted just, freely before God, when he forgiveth us our sins. And
   as I said before, that the doctrine of repentance hath a daily use in
   the Church so must we think of the forgiveness of sins, that the same
   is continually offered unto us; and surely it is no less necessary for
   us during the whole course of our life, than at our first entrance into
   the Church, so that it should profit us nothing to be once received
   into favor by God, unless this embassage should have a continual
   course; be-reconciled unto God, because

   "he which knew no sin was made sin for us, that we might be the
   righteousness of God in him,"
   (2 Corinthians 5:20.)

   Moreover, the Papists do so corrupt this other part of the gospel, that
   they quite exclude the remission of sins, which was to be obtained by
   Christ. They confess their sins are freely forgiven in baptism, but
   they will have them redeemed with satisfactions after baptism; and
   although they mix the grace of Christ together therewithal, yet because
   they inwrap the same in men's merits, they do by this means overthrow
   the whole doctrine of the gospel; for, first, they take from men's
   consciences the certainty of faith; that done, forasmuch as they part
   the forgiveness of sins between the death of Christ and our
   satisfactions, they do altogether deprive us of Christ's benefit. For
   Christ doth not reconcile us unto God in part, but wholly, neither can
   we obtain remission of sins by him, unless it be whole and perfect. But
   the Papists are much deceived therein, who restrain baptism unto the
   nativity and former life, as if the signification and force thereof did
   not reach even unto death.

   Let us know, therefore, that forgiveness of sins is grounded in Christ
   alone, and that we must not think upon any other satisfaction [127]
   save only that which he hath performed by the sacrifice of his death.
   And for this cause, as we have already said, doth Peter express his
   name, whereby he doth signify unto us, that none of all these things
   can be rightly taught, unless Christ be set in the midst, to the end
   the effect of this doctrine may be sought in him. That needeth no long
   exposition where he commandeth them to be baptized for the remission of
   sins; for although God hath once reconciled men unto himself in Christ"
   by not imputing unto them their sins," (2 Corinthians 5:19,) and doth
   now imprint in our hearts the faith thereof by his Spirit; yet,
   notwithstanding, because baptism is the seal whereby he doth confirm
   unto us this benefit, and so, consequently, the earnest and pledge of
   our adoption, it is worthily said to be given us for the remission of
   sins. For because we receive Christ's gifts by faith, and baptism is a
   help to confirm and increase our faith, remission of sins, which is an
   effect of faith, is annexed unto it as unto the inferior mean.
   Furthermore, we must not fetch the definition of baptism from this
   place, because Peter doth only touch a part thereof. Our old man is
   crucified by baptism, as Paul teacheth, that we may rise unto newness
   of life, (Romans 6:4, 6.) And, again, we put on Christ himself, (1
   Corinthians 12.) and the Scripture teacheth every where, that it is
   also a sign and token of repentance, (Galatians 3:27.) But because
   Peter doth not intreat in this place openly of the whole nature of
   baptism, but speaking of the forgiveness of sins, doth, by the way,
   declare that the confirmation thereof is in baptism, there doth no
   inconvenience follow, if ye do omit the other part. [128]

   In the name of Christ. Although baptism be no vain figure, but a true
   and effectual testimony; notwithstanding, lest any man attribute that
   unto the element of water which is there offered, the name of Christ is
   plainly expressed, to the end we may know that it shall be a profitable
   sign for us then, if we seek the force and effect thereof in Christ,
   and know that we are, therefore, washed in baptism, because the blood
   of Christ is our washing; and we do also hereby gather, that Christ is,
   the mark and end whereunto baptism directeth us; wherefore, every one
   profiteth so much in baptism as he learneth to look unto Christ. But
   here ariseth a question, Whether it were lawful for Peter to change the
   form prescribed by Christ? The Papists do think, at least feign so, and
   thence do they take a color of liberty to change or abrogate the
   institutions of Christ. They confess that nothing ought to be changed,
   as touching the substance, but they will have the Church to have
   liberty to change whatsoever it will in the form. But this argument may
   easily be answered. For we must first know that Christ did not indite
   and rehearse unto his apostles magical words for enchanting, as the
   Papists do dream, but he did, in few words, comprehend the sum of the
   mystery. Again, I deny that Peter doth speak in this place of the form
   of baptism; but he doth simply declare that the whole strength [129] of
   baptism is contained in Christ; although Christ cannot be laid hold on
   by faith without the Father by whom he was given us, and the Spirit by
   the which he reneweth and sanctifieth us. The answer consisteth wholly
   in this, that he intreateth not in this place of the certain form of
   baptizing, but the faithful are called back unto Christ, in whom alone
   we have whatsoever baptism doth prefigure unto us; for we are both made
   clean by his blood, and also we enter into a new life by the benefit of
   his death and resurrection.

   Ye shall receive the gift of the Spirit. Because they were touched with
   wondering when they saw the apostles suddenly begin to speak with
   strange tongues, Peter saith that they shall be partakers of the same
   gift if they will pass over unto Christ. Remission of sins and newness
   of life were the principal things, and this was, as it were, an
   addition, that Christ should show forth unto them his power by some
   visible gift. Neither ought this place to be understood of the grace of
   sanctification, which is given generally to all the godly. Therefore he
   promiseth them the gift of the Spirit, whereof they saw a pattern in
   the diversity of tongues. Therefore this doth not properly appertain
   unto us. For because Christ meant to set forth the beginning of his
   kingdom with those miracles, they lasted but for a time; yet because
   the visible graces which the Lord did distribute to his did shoe, as it
   were in a glass, that Christ was the giver of the Spirit, therefore,
   that which Peter saith doth in some respect appertain unto all the
   whole Church: ye shall receive the gift of the Spirit. For although we
   do not receive it, that we may speak with tongues, that we may be
   prophets, that we may cure the sick, that we may work miracles; yet is
   it given us for a better use, that we may believe with the heart unto
   righteousness, that our tongues may be framed unto true confession,
   (Romans 10:10,) that we may pass from death to life, (John 5:24) that
   we, which are poor and empty, may be made rich, that we may withstand
   Satan and the world stoutly. Therefore, the grace of the Spirit shall
   always be annexed unto baptism, unless the let be in ourselves.

   39. For the promise appertaineth unto you. It was requisite that this
   should be expressly added, that the Jews might certainly think and
   persuade themselves that the grace of Christ did belong as well to them
   as to the apostles. And Peter proveth it thus, because the promise of
   God was made unto them. For we must always look unto this, because
   [that] we cannot otherwise know the will of God save only by his word.
   But it is not sufficient to have the general word, unless we know that
   the same is appointed for us. Therefore Peter saith, that those
   benefits which they see in him and his fellows in office were in times
   past promised to the Jews; because this is required necessarily for the
   certainty of faith, that every one be fully persuaded of this, that he
   is comprehended in the number of those unto whom God speaketh. Finally,
   this is the rule of a true faith, when I am thus persuaded that
   salvation is mine, because that promise appertaineth unto me which
   offereth the same. And hereby we have also a greater confirmation, when
   as the promise is extended unto those who were before afar off. For God
   had made the covenant with the Jews, (Exodus 4:22.) If the force and
   fruit thereof come also unto the Gentiles, there is no cause why the
   Jews should doubt of themselves, but that they shall find the promise
   of God firm and stable.

   And we must note these three degrees, that the promise was first made
   to the Jews, and then to their children, and last of all, that it is
   also to be imparted to the Gentiles. We know the reason why the Jews
   are preferred before other people; for they are, as it were, the first
   begotten in God's family, yea, they were then separated from other
   people by a singular privilege. Therefore Peter observeth a good order,
   when he giveth the Jews the pre-eminence. Whereas he adjoineth their
   children unto them, it dependeth upon the words of the promise: I will
   be thy God, and the God of thy seed after thee, (Genesis 17:7,) where
   God doth reckon the children with the fathers in the grace of adoption.

   This place, therefore, doth abundantly refute the manifest error of the
   Anabaptists, which will not have infants, which are the children of the
   faithful, to be baptized, as if they were not members of the Church.
   They espy a starting hole in the allegorical sense, [130] and they
   expound it thus, that by children are meant those which are spiritually
   begotten. But this gross impudency doth nothing help them. It is plain
   and evident that Peter spoke thus because God did adopt one nation
   peculiarly. And circumcision did declare that the right of adoption was
   common even unto infants. Therefore, even as God made his covenant with
   Isaac, being as yet unborn, because he was the seed of Abraham, so
   Peter teacheth, that all the children of the Jews are contained in the
   same covenant, because this promise is always in force, I will be the
   God of your seed.

   And to those which are afar off. The Gentiles are named in the last
   place, which were before strangers. For those which refer it unto those
   Jews which were exiled afar off, (and driven) into far countries, they
   are greatly deceived. For he speaketh not in this place of the distance
   of place; but he noteth a difference between the Jews and the Gentiles,
   that they were first joined to God by reason of the covenant, and so,
   consequently, became of his family or household; but the Gentiles were
   banished from his kingdom. Paul useth the same speech in the second
   chapter to Ephesians, (Ephesians 2:11,) that the Gentiles, which were
   strangers from the promises, are now drawn near, through Jesus Christ,
   unto God. Because that Christ (the wall of separation being taken away)
   hath reconciled both (the Jews and Gentiles) unto the Father, and
   coming, he hath preached peace unto those which were nigh at hand, and
   which were afar off. Now we understand Peter's meaning. For to the end
   he may amplify the grace of Christ, he doth so offer the same unto the
   Jews, that he saith the Gentiles are also partakers thereof. And
   therefore he useth this word call, as if he should say: Like as God
   hath gathered you together into one peculiar people heretofore by his
   voice, so the same voice shall sound everywhere, that those which are
   afar off may come and join themselves unto you, when as they shall be
   called by a new proclamation.

   Acts 2:40-42

   40. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Be ye
   saved from this froward generation. 41. Those, therefore, which
   willingly embraced his words were baptized: and there were added that
   day about three thousand souls. 42. And they continued in the apostles'
   doctrine, and in fellowship, and breaking of bread, and prayers.


   40. And with many Although in these things which we have had hitherto,
   Luke did not recite the words of St Peter, but did only briefly touch
   the chief points; notwithstanding he telleth us again in this place,
   that Peter did not use doctrine only, but did add the pricks of
   exhortations. And he expresseth plainly that tie stood much [131]
   hereupon. Whereas he saith, that he did exhort and beseech, he noteth
   therein his earnestness. For it was not so easy a matter for them by
   and by [132] to take their leave of those errors wherewith they were of
   late infected, and to shake off the government of the priests whereunto
   they were accustomed. Therefore it stood him upon to pull them
   violently out of this mire. The sum was this, that they should beware
   of that froward generation. For they could not be Christ's unless they
   would depart from his professed enemies. The priests and scribes were
   then in great authority, and forasmuch as they did cover themselves
   under the visor [mask] of the Church, they did deceive the simple, this
   did hinder and keep back a great many from coming to Christ. Also some
   might waver, and other some might fall away from the right faith.
   Therefore Peter plainly declareth that they are a froward generation,
   howsoever they may boast of the title of the Church. For which cause he
   commandeth his hearers to separate themselves from them, lest they
   entangle themselves in their wicked and pestiferous fellowship. Whereas
   he saith, Be ye saved, he signifieth unto them that they shall surely
   perish if they couple themselves with such a plague. And surely
   experience doth teach us, how miserably those men are tossed to and fro
   who cannot discern the voice of their pastor from the voice of other
   men; [133] and again, what an hindrance softness and sluggishness is to
   a great many, whilst they desire to stand in a doubt. [134] Therefore
   he commandeth them to depart from the wicked if they will be saved. And
   this point of doctrine is not to be neglected. For it were not
   sufficient to have Christ set before us, unless we were also taught to
   flee those things which do lead us away from him. And it is the duty of
   a good shepherd to defend his sheep from the wolves. So at this day, to
   the end we may keep the people in the sincere doctrine of the gospel,
   we are ever now and then enforced to show and testify how much Papistry
   differeth from Christianity, and what a hurtful plague it is to be
   yoked with the unfaithful enemies of Christ. Neither ought Peter to be
   accused of railing, because he calleth the reverend otthers, who had
   the government of the Church [135] in their hands at that day, a
   froward generation For those dangers which may draw the soul unto
   destruction are to be showed by their names. For men will not beware of
   poison, unless they know that it is poison.

   41. They, therefore, which willingly. Luke showeth more plainly how
   fruitful this one sermon which Peter made was: to wit, that it gained
   unto Christ about three thousand men. And therewithal he declareth the
   nature and force of faith when he saith, that with a prompt and ready
   [136] mind they embraced his word. Therefore, faith must begin with
   this readiness and willing desire to obey. And because many do show
   themselves at the first very willing, who afterward have in themselves
   no constancy or continuance, lest we should think that it was some
   sudden pang [137] which by and by fell away, Luke doth also afterward
   commend their constancy, who (as he said) did willingly embrace this
   word of the apostles, showing that they were joined unto the disciples,
   or that they were engrafted into the same body, and that they continued
   in their doctrine. Therefore we must neither be slow to obey, nor yet
   swift to leap back; but we must stick fast, and stand stoutly to that
   doctrine which we did forthwith (without any tarriance [delay])
   embrace. Furthermore, this example ought to make us not a little
   ashamed. For whereas there was a great multitude converted unto Christ
   with one sermon, an hundred sermons can scarce move a few of us; and
   whereas Luke saith that they continued, there is scarce one amongst ten
   that doth show even a mean desire to profit and go forward, yea,
   rather, the more part doth soon loathe our doctrine. Woe be, therefore,
   to the sluggishness and lightness of the world!

   42. In their doctrine Luke doth not only commend in them the constancy
   of faith or of godliness, but he saith, also, that they did constantly
   give themselves to those exercises which serve to the confirmation of
   faith; to wit, that they studied continually to profit by hearing the
   apostles; that they gave themselves much to prayer; that they did use
   fellowship and breaking of bread very much.

   As touching prayer and doctrine the sense is plain. Communication or
   fellowship, and breaking of bread, may be taken diversely. Some think
   that breaking of bread doth signify the Lord's Supper; other some do
   think that it signifieth alms; other some that the faithful did banquet
   together [138] among themselves. Some do think that koinonia, doth
   signify the celebrating of the Holy Supper; but I do rather agree to
   those others who think that the same is meant by the breaking of bread.
   For koinonia, unless it have somewhat added unto it, is never found in
   this sense; therefore, I do rather refer it unto mutual society and
   fellowship, unto alms, and unto other duties of brotherly fellowship.
   And my reason why I would rather have breaking of bread to be
   understood of the Lord's Supper in this place is this, because Luke
   doth reckon up those things wherein the public estate of the Church is
   contained. Yea, he expresseth in this place four marks whereby the true
   and natural face of the Church may be judged. Do we then seek the true
   Church of Christ? The image thereof is lively depainted and set forth
   [139] unto us in this place. And he beginneth with doctrine which is,
   as it were, the soul of the Church. Neither doth he name all manner of
   doctrine, but the doctrine of the apostles, that is, that which the Son
   of God had delivered by their hands. Therefore, wheresoever the pure
   voice of the gospel doth sound, where men continue in the profession
   thereof, where they exercise themselves in hearing the same ordinarily
   that they may profit, without all doubt there is the Church.

   Hereby we may easily gather how frivolous the boasting of the Papists
   is, whilst that they carelessly [140] thunder out with fall mouth the
   name of the Church; whereas, notwithstanding, they have most filthily
   corrupted the doctrine of the apostles. For if it be duly examined, we
   shall find no sound part at all; and in most points they do as much
   dissent from the same, and have as little agreement therewith as light
   with darkness. The rule of worshipping God, which ought to be fetched
   out of the pure Word of God alone, is only made and patched together
   [141] amongst the Papists, of the superstitious inventions of men. They
   have translated unto the merits of works the hope of salvation, which
   ought to have rested in Christ alone. The invocation of God is
   altogether polluted with innumerable profane dotings of men. Finally,
   whatsoever is heard amongst them, it is either a deforming of the
   apostles' doctrine, or else a clear overthrowing (and destroying) of
   the same. Therefore, we may as easily refute the foolish arrogancy of
   the Papists, as they can cloak their dealings with the title of the
   Church. For this shall be the state, [142] whether they have retained
   the purity of doctrine, from which they are as far as hell is from
   heaven. But they are wise enough in that point, because they will have
   no controversy moved about doctrine. But we, as I have said, may freely
   contemn that vain visor, [mask,] forasmuch as the Spirit of God doth
   pronounce that the Church is principally to be (esteemed and) discerned
   by this mark, if the simplicity or purity of the doctrine delivered by
   the apostles do flourish (and be of force) in the same.

   In fellowship. This member and the last do flow from the first, as
   fruits or effects. For doctrine is the bond of brotherly fellowship
   amongst us, and doth also set open unto us the gate unto God, that we
   may call upon him. And the Supper is added unto doctrine instead of a
   confirmation. Wherefore, Luke doth not in vain reckon up these four
   things, when as he will describe unto us the well-ordered state of the
   Church. And we must endeavor to keep and observe this order, if we will
   be truly judged to be the Church before God and the angels, and not
   only to make boast of the name [143] thereof amongst men. It is certain
   that he speaketh of public prayer. And for this cause it is not
   sufficient for men to make their prayers at home by themselves, unless
   they meet altogether to pray; wherein consisteth also the profession of
   faith.

   Acts 2:43-45

   43. And there came fear upon every soul, and many wonders and signs
   were wrought by the apostles. 44. And all those which believed were
   joined together, and had all things common. 45. And they sold their
   possessions and substance, and did part them to all men, as every man
   had need.


   43. And there came. He signifieth unto us that the show and sight of
   the Church was such, that it made others afraid which did not consent
   unto [its] doctrine; and that was done for the preserving and
   furthering of the Church. When there ariseth any seen all men set
   themselves stoutly against the same; and as novelty is odious, the Jews
   would never have suffered the Church of Christ to stand one minute of
   an hour, [144] unless the Lord had restrained them with fear as with a
   bridle. Furthermore, Luke noteth the manner of fear, that it was no
   such fear as bringeth men unto the obedience of Christ, but such as
   causeth men to stand in a doubt, and so, consequently, doth, as it
   were, so bind them hand and foot, [145] that they dare not hinder the
   Lord's work. Like as there be some at this day who will willingly be
   ignorant of the gospel; or, at least, are so holden [146] with the
   cares of this world, that they cannot thoroughly join themselves unto
   Christ; and yet they are not so hard-hearted but that they confess that
   the truth is on our side; and, therefore, they rest, as it were, in the
   middle way, neither do they favor the cruelty of the wicked, because
   they are afraid to strive against God. And whereas he saith, Every
   soul, he speaketh thus by synecdoche. For it is certain that many did
   contemn the hand of God, and that other some were stricken with no
   great fear, but that they did furiously rage together against the
   Church. [147] But Luke's meaning was this, that there appeared such
   power of God in the Church, that the people for the most part had not
   one word to say. [148]

   And many wonders. This member serveth also to the showing of the cause.
   For the miracles served to make them afraid, together with other works
   of God, although this was not the only reason, but one of many, why
   they were afraid to set themselves against God, who was on that side,
   as they did gather by the miracles; whence we gather that they are not
   only profitable for this to bring men to God, [149] but also to make
   the wicked somewhat more gentle, and that they may tame their
   furiousness. Pharaoh was a man of desperate stubbornness, (Exodus 8:8,
   etc. 19,) and yet we see how miracles do sometimes pierce his obstinate
   heart. He forgetteth them by and by; but when the hand of God is heavy
   upon him, he is compelled through fear to yield. To be brief, Luke
   teacheth that the Jews were by this means kept back, that the Church,
   which might easily have been destroyed, might have got up her head.
   [150] Which thing we have oftentimes tried [151] even in our time. And
   he doth not only declare that they were bridled with fear, lest they
   should be so bold as to attempt so much as they lusted to do hurt to
   the Church, but that they were also humbled with reverence to the glory
   of the gospel.

   44. And all Whereas I have translated it joined together, it is word
   for word in St Luke, Into the same, or into one, which may be expounded
   of the place; as if he should have said that they were wont to dwell
   together in one place. Notwithstanding, I had rather understand it of
   their consent (and agreement;) as he will say in the fourth chapter,
   "That they had one heart," (Acts 4:32.) And so he goeth forward
   orderly, when, as he beginneth with their mind, he addeth afterward
   their bountifulness, as a fruit proceeding thence. Therefore, he giveth
   us to understand that they were rightly joined together with brotherly
   love amongst themselves, and that they did indeed declare the same,
   because the rich men did sell their goods that they might help the
   poor. And this is a singular example of love, and therefore doth Luke
   record the same, to the end we may know that we must relieve the
   poverty of our brethren with our plenty.

   But this place hath need of a sound exposition, because of fantastical
   [fanatical] spirits, which do feign a commonalty or participation
   together of goods, whereby all policy or civil government is taken
   away; as in this age the Anabaptists have raged, because they thought
   there was no Church unless all men's goods were put and gathered
   together, as it were, in one heap, that they might all one with another
   take thereof. Wherefore, we must in this point beware of two extremes.
   For many, under color of policy, do keep close and conceal whatsoever
   they have; they defraud the poor, and they think that they are twice
   righteous, so they take away no other men's goods. Other some are
   carried into the contrary error, because they would have all things
   confused. But what doth Luke? Surely he noteth another order, when he
   saith that there was choice made in the distribution. If any man object
   that no man had any thing which was his own, seeing all things were
   common, we may easily answer. For this community or participation
   together must be restrained unto the circumstance which ensueth
   immediately; to wit, that the poor might be relieved as every man had
   need. We know the old proverb, "All things are common amongst friends."
   When as the scholars of Pythagoras said thus, they did not deny but
   that every man might govern his own house privately, neither did they
   intend to make their own wives common; so this having of things common,
   whereof Luke speaketh, and which he commendeth, doth not take away
   household government; which thing shall better appear by the fourth
   chapter, whereas he nameth two alone which sold their possessions of so
   many thousands. Whence we gather that which I said even now, that they
   brought forth and made common their goods in no other respect, save
   only that they might relieve the present necessity. And the impudency
   of the monks was ridiculous, who did profess that they did observe the
   apostles' rule, because they call nothing their own; and yet,
   nevertheless, they neither sell any thing, neither yet do they pass for
   any man's poverty; [152] but they stuff their idle bellies with the
   blood of the poor, neither do they regard any other thing in their
   having of things common, save only that they may be well filled and
   daintily, although all the whole world be hungry. Wherein, then, are
   they like to the first disciples, with whom they will be thought to be
   able to compare? [153]

   Acts 2:46-47

   46. And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking
   bread from house to house, they did eat their meat with gladness, and
   singleness of heart, 47. Praising God, and having favor with all the
   people. And the Lord added daily unto the congregation those which
   should be saved.


   46. Continuing in the temple We must note that they did frequent the
   temple for this cause, because there was more opportunity and occasion
   offered there to further the gospel. Neither were they drawn with the
   holiness of the place, seeing they knew that the shadows of the law
   were ceased; neither meant they to draw others by their example to have
   the temple in any such reverence; [154] but because there was there
   great concourse of people, who having laid aside their private cares,
   wherewith they had been drawn away elsewhere, [155] did seek the Lord;
   they were continually in the temple, that they might gain such unto
   Christ. There might be another reason which might induce them hereunto,
   that they might have a mutual conference and imparting of doctrine
   amongst themselves, which they could not have done so conveniently in a
   private house, especially seeing they were so, many.

   Breaking bread from house to house. Luke signifieth unto us, that they
   did not only show some token of true godliness publicly, but that the
   course and tenor of their private life was alone in that respect. For
   whereas some do think that in this place, by breaking of bread is meant
   the Holy Supper, it seemeth to me that Luke meant no such thing. He
   signifieth, therefore, unto us, that they used to eat together, and
   that thriftily. [156] For those which make sumptuous banquets do not
   eat their meat together so familiarly. Again, Luke addeth, in
   singleness of heart; which is also a token of temperance. In sum, his
   meaning is to declare, that their manner of living was brotherly and
   sober. Some do join simplicity and gladness with the praise of God; and
   both texts may well be allowed. [157] But because there can be no
   singleness of heart in praising God, unless the stone be also in all
   parts of the life, therefore it is certain, that there is mention made
   thereof in this sense, that the faithful did always use the same in all
   places. [158] And we must also note the circumstance of time, that,
   being environed and beset with many dangers, they were merry and
   joyful. The knowledge of God's love toward us, and the hope of his
   protection, do bring us this goodness with them, that we praise God
   with quiet minds, whatsoever the world doth threaten. And as Luke spoke
   a little before of the public estate of the Church, so he declareth now
   what form and manner of life the faithful did use; that we may learn by
   their example a thrifty fellowship in our manner of living, and in all
   our whole life to embrace singleness, to enjoy the spiritual joy, and
   to exercise ourselves in the praises of God. Furthermore, the
   singleness of heart reacheth far; but if you join it in this place with
   breaking of bread, it shall signify as much as sincere love, where one
   man dealeth plainly with another, neither doth any man craftily hunt
   after his own profit. Yet had I rather set the same against that
   carefulness, wherewith worldly men [159] do too much torment
   themselves. For when as we do not cast our care upon the Lord, this
   reward hangeth over our heads, that we tremble and quake even when we
   take our rest.

   47. Having favor. This is the fruit of an innocent life, to find favor
   even amongst strangers. And yet we need not to doubt of this, but that
   they were hated of many. But although he speak generally of the people,
   yet he meaneth that part alone which was sound, neither yet infected
   with any poison of hatred; he signifieth briefly, that the faithful did
   so behave themselves, that the people did full well like of them for
   their innocency of life. [160]

   The Lord added daily. He showeth in these words that their diligence
   was not without profit; they studied so much as in them lay to gather
   into the Lord's sheepfold those which wandered and went astray. He
   saith that their labor bestowed herein was not lost; because the Lord
   did increase his Church daily. And surely, whereas the Church is rather
   diminished than increased, that is to be imputed to our slothfulness,
   or rather forwardness. [161] And although they did all of them stoutly
   labor to increase the kingdom of Christ, yet Luke ascribeth [162] this
   honor to God alone, that he brought strangers into the Church. And
   surely this is his own proper work. For the ministers do no good by
   planting or watering, unless he make their labor effectual by the power
   of his Spirit, (1 Corinthians 3.) Furthermore, we must note that he
   saith, that those were gathered unto the Church which should be saved.
   For he teacheth that this is the means to attain salvation, if we be
   incorporate into the Church. For like as there is no remission of sins,
   so neither is there any hope of salvation. [163] Furthermore, this is
   an excellent comfort for all the godly, that they were received into
   the Church that they might be saved; as the Gospel is called the power
   of God unto salvation to all that believe, (Romans 1:16.) Now,
   forasmuch as God doth gather only a part, or a certain number, this
   grace is restrained unto election, that it may be the first cause of
   our salvation.

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 3:1-11

   1. Now, [or almost at that time,] Peter and John went up together into
   the temple, about the ninth hour of prayer. 2. Furthermore, a certain
   man, which was lame from his mother's womb, was carried; whom they laid
   daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, that he
   might ask alms of those which entered into the temple. 3. When he saw
   Peter and John draw near to the temple, he asked an alms. 4. And Peter,
   beholding him earnestly with John, said, Look on us. 5. And he gave
   heed unto them, thinking that he should receive somewhat of them. 6.
   And Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have, give I
   thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk. 7. And
   when he had taken him by the right hand, he lifted him up, and
   immediately his feet and ankle-bones received strength. 8. And leaping
   up he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple,
   walking, and leaping, and praising God. 9. And all the people saw him
   walking, and praising God. 10. And they knew him, that it was he which
   was wont to sit for the alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple. And
   they were filled with wondering, and were astonied at that thing which
   was come unto him. 11. Moreover, when the lame man which was healed
   held Peter and John, all the people ran amazed unto them, into the
   Porch which is called Solomon's.


   1. We saw before that many signs were showed by the hands of the
   apostles; now Luke reciteth one of many for example's sake, after his
   common custom; namely, that a lame man, which was lame of his feet from
   his mother's womb, was perfectly restored to his limbs. And he doth
   diligently gather all the circumstances which serve to set forth the
   miracle. If it had been that his legs had been out of joint, or if it
   had been some disease coming by some casualty, it might have been the
   more easily cured. But the default of nature [164] could not have been
   so easily redressed. When as he saith that he was carried, we gather
   thereby that it was no light halting, but that this man did lie as if
   his legs had been dead. Forasmuch as he was wont daily to ask alms,
   hereby all the people might the better know him. In that being healed,
   he walked in the temple at the time of prayer, this served to spread
   abroad the fame of the miracle. Furthermore, this doth not a little set
   forth the same, that being lifted up and set upon his feet, he leapeth
   up therewithal, and walketh joyfully.

   Went up together Because these words, epi to auto, doth no more signify
   place than time, this latter sense seemeth better to agree with the
   text of Peter, yet, because it is of no great importance, I leave it
   indifferent. That it is called the ninth hour of prayer, when as the
   day began to draw towards night. [165] For seeing the day from the
   rising of the sun unto the going down thereof had twelve hours, as I
   have said elsewhere, all that time was divided into four parts. So that
   by the ninth is meant the last portion of the day; as the first hour
   did continue unto the third, the third unto the sixth, the sixth unto
   the ninth. Hence may we gather, by a probable conjecture, that that
   hour was appointed for the evening sacrifice. Furthermore, if any man
   ask, whether the apostles went up into the temple that they might pray
   according to the rite of the law, I do not think that that is a thing
   so likely to be true, as that they might have better opportunity to
   spread abroad the gospel. And if any man will abuse this place, as if
   it were lawful for us to use and take up superstitious worshippings,
   whilst that we are conversant amongst the ignorant and weak, his reason
   shall be frivolous. The Lord appointed that the Jews should offer
   sacrifice morning and evening, (Exodus 29:41.) By this exercise were
   they taught to begin and end the day with calling upon the name of God,
   and with worshipping him, [166] (Numbers 28:2.) Therefore Peter and
   John might freely come into the temple, which was consecrated to God;
   neither did they pollute themselves, seeing they called upon the God of
   Israel, that they might thereby declare their godliness. First, in that
   the Lord would have the older people to observe the appointed hours,
   [167] we gather thereby that the Church cannot be without certain
   discipline. And even at this day, were it profitable for us to have
   such meetings daily, unless our too [too] much sluggishness did let us.
   And whereas the apostles go up at that hour, hereby we gather that we
   must foreslow [neglect] no opportunity that is offered us for the
   furtherance of the gospel.

   3. He asketh an alms. We see how God restored this lame man to his
   limbs contrary to his expectation. Because he thought that his disease
   was incurable, he was only careful for maintenance. That is given him
   which he durst never have asked. In like sort God doth oftentimes
   prevent us, neither doth he stay until he be provoked. [168] And hence
   can we not gather any occasion of slothfulness, as if the Lord did
   therefore meet us of his own accord, that being idle and slothful we
   may suffer the Lord to do good unto us. For we are commanded to pray,
   and therefore let us not foreslow [neglect] our duty. [169] But, first
   of all, under the person of the lame man, we have set before us an
   example of a man that is not yet illuminated by faith, that he may know
   how to pray aright. Such doth God prevent, as it is needful, even of
   his own accord. Therefore, when as he restoreth our souls not only to
   health, but also to life, he himself is to himself the cause hereof.
   For this is the beginning of our calling, that he may make those things
   to be which are not; that he may show himself unto those who seek not
   after him, (Romans 4:17.) Furthermore, howsoever we be already taught
   by faith to pray unto God, yet, because we do not always feel our
   miseries, it cometh not into our mind to seek for remedy; therefore the
   Lord bringeth the same freely and unlooked for. Finally, howsoever we
   be bent to pray, yet doth he exceed our hope and petitions with his
   goodness.

   4. Look upon us. Peter doth not thus speak before he be certain of the
   purpose and intent of God. And surely in these words he commandeth him
   to hope for some singular and unwonted benefit; yet here may a question
   be moved, whether they had power to work miracles so often as they
   would? I answer, that they were ministers of God's power in such sort,
   that they did attempt nothing of their own will or proper motion, but
   the Lord wrought by them, when he knew that it was expedient it should
   be so. Hereby it came to pass that they healed one and not all.
   Therefore, as in other things, they had the Spirit of God to be their
   guide and director, so also in this point. Therefore, before such time
   as Peter commandeth the lame man to arise, he did east and fasten his
   eyes upon him; this steadfast looking upon him was not without some
   peculiar motion of the Spirit. Hereby it cometh to pass that he
   speaketh so surely (and safely, without all fear) of the miracle.
   Furthermore, he meant by this word to provoke the lame man to receive
   the grace of God; yet doth he look for nothing but for an alms.

   6. Silver and gold. Peter doth truly excuse himself, that he doth want
   that help which the lame man did require. And therefore doth he
   declare, that if he were able to relieve his poverty he would willingly
   do it; like as every man ought to consider with himself what the Lord
   hath given him, that he may therewith help his neighbors. For what
   store soever God giveth to every man, he will have the same to be an
   instrument and help to exercise love. Therefore he saith, that he
   giveth that which he hath. This was at the first a trick of mockage,
   [170] in that Peter beginneth to speak of his poverty, after that he
   had brought the lame man into a rare hope, as if he meant to mock a
   gaping crow; but he comforteth him immediately, to the end the miracle
   might be had in greater estimation by the comparison. That is horrible
   wickedness, in that the Pope, when as he is created, doth most
   unshamefastly [shamelessly] abuse this place, making thereof a comical,
   or rather a scoffing play. There be two cells, or places made of stone,
   in the one whereof when he sitteth, and the people ask an alms, using
   these words of Peter, he casteth abroad crosses in the air with his
   fingers. When he is brought into the next tell, or place, he hath bags
   full of money. Then his angels cry unto him,

   "He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor,"
   (Psalm 112:9.)

   I have made mention hereof, to the end all men may see that Satan doth
   questionless reign there, where they do so manifestly mock the sacred
   Word of God. And to the end I may return unto the former sentence, it
   is evident enough that Peter was instructed by a certain and sure
   revelation, when as he saith that he hath the gift of healing.

   In the name of Jesus. He saith that this is the work and benefit of
   Christ, that he restoreth to the cripple the use of his feet, for name
   is taken for power and empire, or government. Neither must we dream
   that there is any magical force in the sounding or pronouncing of the
   word, as the Jews do dote about the word Jehovah. To be short, Peter
   meant to declare that he was nothing but a minister, and that Christ
   was the author of the miracle. For this ought to have been, and was his
   care, that Christ might be made known unto the world, and that his name
   might be sanctified. But why doth he give Christ this epithet, or
   title, of Nazareth? I leave to other men their own judgment; but I
   think thus: Forasmuch as Christ was thus called in contempt, Peter
   meant of set purpose to express that that Jesus of Nazareth whom they
   had crucified, and whose name was despised and without glory amongst
   the Jews, and was to the most of them detestable, was nevertheless the
   Messias promised of God, and that all power was given unto him of the
   rather; as Paul saith, that he preacheth Christ and him crucified, (1
   Corinthians 2:2.)

   Arise and walk. This might seem to be a very ridiculous thing. For the
   cripple might have readily objected, Why hast thou not first given me
   legs and feet? For this is a plain mock, when as thou biddest a man
   without feet to go. But he believed Peter's words; and he, which was at
   the first so slow, doth now with a ready and joyful mind embrace God's
   benefit. Whereby appeareth both the force of the word, and also the
   fruit of faith. The force of the word is double, both in that the
   cripple is so touched that he doth forthwith obey without delay; and in
   that it giveth strength to his dead members, and doth, after a sort,
   renew the man. And faith also hath her reward, in that the cripple
   obeyeth him which commandeth him to rise not in vain. Therefore we see
   how God worketh by his Word, to wit, when he giveth success to the
   preaching thereof, that it may pierce into the minds of men; secondly,
   when he giveth those things with his hand which are promised there.
   Moreover, he suffereth not faith to be void, but she doth indeed truly
   enjoy all those good things which she looketh for, and which are
   offered unto her in the same Word. And we must remember that which I
   have already said, that we have in this history a type [171] or figure
   of our spiritual restoring; namely, that as the Word, laid hold on by
   faith, did restore the cripple to his limbs, so the Lord pierceth into
   our souls by the Word, that he may restore the same. And, first of all,
   he speaketh by man's mouth, and pricketh us forward by the obedience of
   faith; that done, he moveth our hearts inwardly by his Spirit, that the
   Word may take lively root in us; finally, he reacheth out his hand, and
   by all means he finisheth his work in us. We gather out of Matthew that
   miracles must be thus handled.

   9. And all the people saw. He beginneth now to declare the fruit of the
   miracle, to wit, that the cripple began to show his thankfulness by
   praising God, and that all the people were brought into great
   wondering. And here is a double fruit. For he which was healed doth
   acknowledge and set forth the benefit of God; on the other side, the
   people is moved, and the fame is spread abroad, many come to see it.
   And whereas Luke saith that they were filled with wondering, it doth
   only declare a preparation, which a more full proceeding [172] (and
   going forward) did at length follow. For it was necessary that they
   should go forward, because this their wondering had served to no end of
   itself, but did rather make them astonied and amazed, than bring them
   (from their own proceedings) unto God.

   Therefore it was, as it were, the foundation of the building which was
   to come, in that the people was touched with amazedness. For if we pass
   over the works of God contemptibly or carelessly, we shall never be
   able to profit by them. Furthermore, this place doth teach us what
   miracles do work of themselves in men; to wit, that they breed a
   confused amazedness. For although the Lord doth call us straightway
   unto himself, by showing plainly his goodness and power there, yet such
   is the weakness of our nature, that we stumble or faint in the midway,
   until such time as we be holpen by doctrine.

   Let us, therefore, learn reverently to consider the works of God, that
   the wondering at them may make an entrance for doctrine. For when
   doctrine is cold and unprofitable with us, God doth justly punish our
   unthankfulness by this means, because we have despised the glory of his
   works. Again, because we are not so quick of sight, that we can see so
   much in the works of God alone, as is sufficient, let us learn to join
   therewithal the help of doctrine. [173] To be brief, the one ought not
   to be separated from the other. Which thing experience doth
   sufficiently teach us. For hereby it came to pass that the world did so
   wickedly abuse miracles.

   The Papists do object unto us miracles again and again. Let us suppose
   that they be true, whereof they make such boast, yet do they greatly
   err in this, that they wrest them to a wrong end; to wit, that they may
   darken the name of God, and infect the pure truth of the gospel with
   their inventions. For whence come so many superstitious worshippings of
   saints, save only from the abuse of miracles? For when any miracle is
   wrought, men must needs be moved. And because they are deaf when they
   should hear the Word, and do not mark what God cloth mean, Satan doth
   craftily take an occasion of superstition by our amazedness. [174] As,
   for example, I will acknowledge the power of God in a miracle. If it
   were wrought by Peter, Satan will by and by put this in my head, and
   will say thus: [175] Dost thou not see that this is a man of God? [176]
   therefore thou dost owe unto him divine honor. The same thing had
   befallen the Jews when they were amazed, unless Peter's sermon had
   called them back into the right way. But in Popery, where none did call
   them back or reprove them, [177] the preposterous wondering of men did
   easily get the upper hand. Wherefore, we must so much the more [178]
   seek for medicine out of the Word, that doctrine may direct us unto the
   right end, being lifted up [179] with the miracles.

   11. In the porch. It is like that there was a porch built in that place
   where Solomon's porch was sometimes, and that it took the name
   therefrom. For the old temple was pulled down, but Zerubbabel and Ezra,
   ill the re-edifying and new building of the same temple, had imitated
   the same, so nigh as they could possibly devise. Afterward Herod
   renewed the same, and made it far more gorgeous, but that vain cost
   which he had bestowed had not yet blotted out the remembrance of
   Solomon in the hearts of the people. And Luke nameth the same as a most
   famous place, whereunto the people ran together (by heaps, to celebrate
   their feasts unto God at the times appointed.)

   Acts 3:12-16

   12. And when Peter saw that, he made answer unto the people, Men of
   Israel, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye so steadfastly on us, as
   if by our own power or godliness we have made this man walk? 13. The
   God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath
   glorified his Son Jesus, whom ye have delivered, and whom ye have
   denied before the face of Pilate, when he had judged him to be loosed.
   14. But ye have denied the holy, the just, and have desired to have a
   murderer given you. 15. But ye have murdered the Prince of life: whom
   God hath raised up from the dead; whereof we are witnesses: and in the
   faith of his name, his name hath strengthened this man, whom ye have
   seen and known. 16. And the faith which is by him hath given him this
   perfect soundness in presence of you all.


   12. Men of Israel He beginneth his sermon with a reproving of the
   people. And yet doth he not simply reprove them because they wonder;
   for that was altogether profitable and worthy praise; but because they
   do wickedly ascribe unto men that praise which is due to the work of
   God. As if he should say, Ye do amiss, in that you stay in us, and
   stand gazing upon us, whereas you ought rather to look upon God and
   Christ. Therefore, this is to be amazed evilly, when as our minds do
   stay in men. And we must note that he condemneth the respect of men; as
   if, saith he, we by our own power and virtue had done this. Therefore
   there is an error and corruption in this, if we attribute that unto the
   godliness and power of men which is proper to God and Christ. And, as
   concerning power, no man will deny that it cometh of God; yet when they
   have confessed this in one word, they do not cease to take from God his
   right, to the end they may adorn the creatures with that which they
   take from him; as we see the Papists place the power of God in the
   saints; yea, they include his power in a stone or stock of wood, so
   soon as the image is consecrated to Barbara or Chrysogonus. But,
   notwithstanding, let us suppose that they do not offend in that former
   member; yet do they foolishly think that they have done their duty
   toward God, when as they leave him the power, and assign the miracles
   unto the godliness of saints. For why do they run unto them, when they
   will obtain either rain or fair weather, or be delivered from diseases,
   unless they do imagine that they have by their godliness deserved that
   God should grant them this right and privilege? This is, therefore, but
   a childish starting-hole, [180] when they confess that God is the
   author of the power; but they thank the godliness of saints for those
   benefits which they have received. Howsoever they color the matter, we
   must always know this, that Peter doth generally condemn those which do
   so look unto men in miracles, that they think that their holiness is
   the cause thereof. This is the first part of the sermon, wherein he
   reproveth superstition. And we must note his manner and order of
   teaching. For because men are inclined to nothing more than to fall
   from God unto the creatures, it is very expedient to prevent this vice
   in time. And if the people were forbidden to look unto the apostles,
   much more doth the Spirit draw us away from calling upon every petty
   saint.

   13, 14. The God of Abraham. He addeth a remedy now in calling them back
   unto Christ. And the sum is this, That this is God's purpose in those
   miracles which he worketh by the apostles to set forth the glory of his
   Christ; whereupon it followeth that all those do deal disorderly who
   set up Peter, or any other, whatsoever he be, forasmuch as all men must
   decrease, and Christ alone must be excellent, (John 3:30.) Here
   appeareth a manifest difference between Christ and the apostles. First
   of all, he is the author, they are only the ministers; secondly, this
   is the lawful end, that he alone may have the glory; and as for them
   there is no respect to be had of them as concerning glory; for
   certainly they which do glorify any in miracles besides Christ, they
   set themselves flatly against the counsel of God.

   He maketh mention of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to the end
   he may declare unto the people that he meaneth nothing less than to
   lead them away from the old and ancient worship of the true God, which
   they had received of the fathers. Furthermore, God hath given himself
   this title, that he might (dissever and) distinguish himself by some
   mark from idols; for we do not comprehend God in his essence, which
   cannot be seen, and which is infinite; therefore, he useth such means
   as agree best with us, to bring us to the knowledge of him. The Turks
   do boast that they do worship God, which is the creator of heaven and
   earth; but before they come at heaven they vanish away. Therefore, to
   the end God might keep his people from vain and erroneous inventions,
   he kept them in his covenant; therefore, when he calleth himself the
   God of Abraham, he did briefly teach that which Moses declareth more at
   large, (Deuteronomy 30:12,)

   "Say not, Who shall ascend into heaven? Who shall go down into the
   depth? Or who shall sail over the seas? The word is nigh," etc.

   Furthermore, as amongst the Jews the name of the holy fathers was in
   high estimation, so Peter doth closely [181] tell them, that they were
   no better than other men, without the only begotten Son of God. And at
   this day God will be known by a more evident mark yet, when as he
   calleth himself the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Let us now return unto Peter; he saith that he bringeth in no new
   religion, that. he may draw away the people from the law and the
   prophets; for if he should attempt this, God had forbidden them to hear
   him, (Deuteronomy 13:3.) Like as Paul teacheth, that we must retain one
   foundation in the spiritual building, (1 Corinthians 3:11,) because, so
   soon as we depart even but a little from Christ, there can nothing
   ensue but ruin. And hereby also we may easily discern in what sense he
   calleth God the God of the fathers; for neither doth he take this for a
   general maxim, that what manner of worship soever the fathers had, we
   must continue the same, as the Papists do foolishly vaunt that they do
   follow the manner of worshipping which was used amongst the fathers;
   for Peter doth expressly reckon up Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from whom
   true religion did proceed, and by whom it was divinely delivered;
   whereby he doth signify unto us, that we must not follow all fathers,
   whereof many did grow out of kind, and became altogether unlike to the
   first fathers; that this honor is due to the children of God alone, and
   that others are to be refused; which thing the prophets do also beat in
   [182] everywhere:

   "Walk not in the ways of your fathers," etc.,
   (Ezekiel 20:18.)

   Whom ye have delivered He mingleth with doctrine a most sharp chiding,
   according as the matter did require; for it was impossible to bring
   them truly unto God, unless they were first brought to the knowledge of
   their sins; neither doth he only lightly touch them, but he doth very
   gravely show them the horribleness of that offense which they had
   committed. To this end tendeth that comparison, that they delivered him
   to be put to death, whom Pilate would have loosed; and again, that,
   pardoning a murderer, they put the Prince of life to death; that they
   did reject the just and holy. Men must be so stricken, that being
   brought to know their guiltiness, they may earnestly fly unto the
   remedy of pardon. Such vehemence and earnestness did Peter also use in
   his first sermon; he saith afterward that God raised him up, whereby
   they ought to know that, in putting Christ to death, they did strive
   against God; although Peter had respect unto an higher thing, to wit,
   that their cruelty did no whit impair the glory of Christ, because God
   had nevertheless restored him to life. When as he saith, that he and
   his fellows in office were witnesses of the resurrection, his meaning
   is, that they saw it with their eyes, (Luke 24:48.) Therefore, this is
   referred not only unto the apostolical function, but because they saw
   Christ with their eyes after that he was risen from the dead; although
   I do also grant that this second thing is comprehended under these
   words, because it is likely that Peter doth make mention of that
   function which was committed unto him, to the end he may purchase the
   greater authority.

   16. And in the faith of his name. When as he saith in the faith of his
   name, and his name; and again, the faith which is by him; this
   repetition is a token of a fervent affection, for because he was wholly
   given to set forth the glory of Christ, he beateth in [inculcateth] the
   same thing oftentimes. Moreover, we see that when Paul is occupied
   about the showing and setting forth of the grace of Christ, he thinketh
   that he hath never spoken enough touching the same; and surely such is
   the wicked nature of men, that Christ cannot be so highly extolled, and
   so preached, that his honor can remain sound unto him. Let us,
   therefore, remember that Peter did use such variety and plenty of
   words, to the end he might stay us in Christ. As touching the phrase,
   when as he saith, his name in the faith of his name hath strengthened,
   he showeth both the cause and the manner; the power of Christ had
   healed the cripple but by faith. When as he saith, the faith which is
   by him, by this word he signifieth unto us that our faith cannot arise
   up unto God unless it be grounded in Christ, and se, consequently, that
   this our faith doth look unto Christ and stay itself upon him, and so
   he showeth that there cat be no right faith in God when we pass over
   this mean.

   Furthermore, as he said before, that he and the other apostles were
   witnesses of Christ's life, so he doth now declare that this life was
   manifestly proved unto the Jews by a sign or effect, because they see
   the cripple healed, in whom they had an excellent and evident token of
   the Divine power of Christ. And when as in this last member he maketh
   faith the cause of this soundness, he layeth unthankfulness to their
   charge by the way, unless they give faith her due praise; and although
   faith may be referred as well unto the man that was healed as unto the
   apostles, yet we need not to stand much about this manner, because the
   power of the gospel is set forth by synecdoche.

   Repent, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be forgiven,
   20. When the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the
   Lord; and he shall send him that was preached before, Jesus Christ: 21.
   Whom heaven must contain until the time that all things be restored,
   which he hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets, since the
   beginning of the world, [or set before your eyes and represented.]


   17. Because it was to be doubted, lest, being cast down with despair,
   they should refuse his doctrine, he doth a little lift them up. We must
   so temper our sermons that they may profit the hearers, for unless
   there be some hope of pardon left, the terror and fear of punishment
   doth harden men's hearts with stubbornness; for that of David is true,
   That we fear the Lord when we perceive that he is unto us favorable,
   and easy to be pacified, (Psalm 130:4.) Thus doth Peter lessen the sin
   of his nation, because of their ignorance; for it had been impossible
   for them to have suffered and endured this conscience, if they had
   denied the Son of God, and delivered him to be slain, wittingly and
   willingly; and yet will he not flatter them, when as he saith that they
   did it through ignorance; but he doth only somewhat mitigate his
   speech, lest they should be overwhelmed and swallowed up of despair.
   Again, we must not so take the words as if the people did sin simply of
   ignorance, for under this there did lie hid hypocrisy; but as
   wickedness or ignorance doth abound, the action is named of the one or
   the other. This is, therefore, Peter's meaning, that they did it rather
   through error and a blind zeal, than through any determined wickedness;
   but a question may be moved here, if ally man have offended wittingly
   and willingly, whether he shall surely fall into despair or not? I
   answer, that he doth not make mention in this place of all manner of
   sin; but only of the denying of Christ, and of the extinguishing of the
   grace of God, so much as in them did lie. If any man be desirous to
   know more concerning this, he may read the first chapter of the First
   Epistle to Timothy, (1 Timothy 1:13.)

   As did also your rulers. First, this seemeth to be an improper
   comparison, for the scribes and the priests were carried headlong with
   a wonderful madness, and they were full of wicked unfaithfulness; [183]
   but the perverse study and zeal of the law did prick forward the
   people. Again, the people were incensed against Christ, inasmuch as
   their rulers did provoke them thereunto. I answer, that they were not
   all of one mind, for without doubt many of them were like unto Paul,
   unto whom that doth truly appertain, which he writeth elsewhere of the
   princes and rulers of this world, if they had known the wisdom of God
   they would never have crucified the Lord of glory; therefore, he
   speaketh not generally of all the rulers; but if any of them be
   curable, them doth he invite to repentance.

   18. And God Hereby it appeareth more plainly to what end he made
   mention of ignorance; for when he telleth them that God hath
   accomplished those things which he had foretold, he doth so touch their
   offense in the death of Christ, that it turneth to their salvation.
   Ignorance, saith he, hath made you guilty, yet God hath brought that to
   pass which he had determined, that Christ should redeem you by his
   death. This is a most notable consideration, when as we ponder and
   consider with ourselves, that through the wonderful counsel of God our
   evils are turned to another end to us, yet this doth no whir excuse us,
   for so much as in us lieth we cast away [184] ourselves by sinning; but
   that conversion whereof I have spoken is a notable work of God's mercy,
   whereof we must speak, and which we must extol with humility. The Jews
   did what they could to extinguish all hope of life in the person of
   Christ; and yet, nevertheless, that death gave life as well to them as
   to the whole world. We must also remember that which we saw elsewhere,
   lest there should any false and absurd opinion creep in, that Christ
   was laid open to the lust of the wicked, that God is made the chief
   author by whose will his only Son did suffer.

   19. Repent We must note, that when he exhorteth unto repentance, he
   doth also declare that there is remission of sins prepared for them
   before the face of God. For, as I said of late, no man can be stirred
   up to repentance, unless he have salvation set before him; but he which
   doth despair of pardon, being, as it were, given over unto destruction
   already, doth not fear to run headlong against God obstinately. Hereby
   it cometh to pass that the Papists cannot deliver the doctrine of
   repentance. They babble, indeed, very much concerning the same; but
   because they overthrow the hope of grace, it cannot be that they should
   persuade their disciples unto the study of repentance. Moreover, I
   confess that they babble a little touching forgiveness of sins; but
   because they leave men's souls in doubt and in fearfulness, and,
   furthermore, do cast them as it were into a labyrinth, (or place out of
   which they know not how to come,) this part of the doctrine being
   corrupt, they confound the other also.

   20. That when If we follow Erasmus and the old interpreter, this
   sentence shall be unperfect, [185] which may be made perfect, thus:
   When the time of refreshing shall come, you may also enjoy this
   refreshing; when Christ shall come to judge the world, you may find him
   a redeemer and not a Judge. But because Beza doth fitly translate it,
   After that they shall come, it is better to retain that which is not so
   racked; [186] so you resolve it thus: That sins are so forgiven against
   the day of the last judgment; because, unless we be cited to appear
   before God's judgment-seat we are not greatly careful to pacify God.
   First of all, we must note, that he setteth before them the day of
   judgment, to the end the former exhortation may take the greater
   effect. For there is nothing which doth more prick us, than when we are
   taught that we must once give an account. For so long as our senses are
   holden and kept in this world, they are drowned, as it were, in a
   certain drowsiness, [187] that I may so call it. Wherefore the message
   of the last judgment must sound as a trumpet to cite us to appear
   before the judgment-seat of God. For then at last being truly awaked,
   we begin to think of a new life. In like sort, when Paul preached at
   Athens, God saith, that he doth now will all men to repent; because he
   hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world, (Acts 17:30, 31.)
   The sum is this, that Christ, who is now unto us a Master, when as he
   teacheth us by the gospel, is appointed of the Father to be a Judge,
   and shall come in his due time; and that, therefore, we must obey his
   doctrine betimes, that we may gather the fruit of our faith then.

   But some man may object, that Peter speaketh otherwise of the last day.
   For this doth not serve to make them afraid, when he saith, the time of
   refreshing. I answer, that there is a double prick, wherewith the
   faithful are pricked forward when as they are told of the last
   judgment. For the profit of faith doth not appear in this world, yea
   rather it seemeth to go well with the despisers of God; but the life of
   the godly is full of miseries. Therefore our hearts should oftentimes
   faint and quail, unless we should remember that the day of rest shall
   come, which shall quench all the heat of our trouble, and make an end
   of our miseries. The other prick whereof I spoke is this, when as the
   fearful judgment of God causeth us to shake off delicacy and
   drowsiness. So Peter mixeth in this place threatenings with promises,
   partly to the end he may allure the Jews unto Christ, and partly that
   he may prick them forward with fear. Furthermore, this is a thing much
   used in the Scripture, as it speaketh either unto the reprobate, or
   unto the elect, sometimes to make the day of the Lord doleful and
   fearful, sometimes to make the same pleasant and to be wished for.
   Peter therefore doth very well, who, whilst that he putteth the Jews in
   good hope of pardon, doth make the day of Christ pleasant to them, to
   the end they may desire the same.

   And shall send him. He saith expressly that Christ shall be Judge, to
   the end they may know that the contempt of the gospel shall not be
   unpunished. For how should not Christ punish the same? In the
   meanwhile, this doth greatly comfort the faithful, when as they know
   that it shall be in his hand to give salvation, who doth now promise
   and offer the same. He addeth, moreover, that he shall come who is now
   preached unto them. Whereby he taketh away all excuse of ignorance. As
   if he should say, Christ is preached unto you now before he come to
   judge the world; to the end that those who will embrace him may receive
   the fruit of their faith at that day; and to the end that others, who
   shall refuse him, may be punished for their unbelief. Although the
   Grecians do read this two ways; for some books [188] have
   prokekerugmenon, that is, preached before; and other some
   prokecheirismenon, that is, showed, or set before their eyes. But both
   have one sense, to wit, that Christ is not offered unto them in vain
   now by the doctrine of the gospel; because he shall be sent the second
   time by his Father to be a Judge, armed and prepared to render
   vengeance, unless they embrace him now for their Redeemer.

   21. Whom the heaven must contain. Because men's senses are always bent
   and inclined towards the gross and earthly beholding of God and Christ,
   the Jews might think with themselves that Christ was preached, indeed,
   to be raised up from the dead, yet could they not tell where he was;
   for no man did show them where he was. Therefore Peter preventeth them,
   when he saith that he is in heaven. Whereupon it followeth that they
   must lift up their minds on high, to the end they may seek Christ with
   the eyes of faith, although he be far from them, [189] although he
   dwell without the world in the heavenly glory. But this is a doubtful
   [190] speech; because we may as well understand it that Christ is
   contained or comprehended in the heavens, as that he doth comprehend
   the heavens. Let us not therefore urge the word, being of a doubtful
   signification; but let us content ourselves with that which is certain,
   that we must seek for Christ nowhere else save only in heaven, whilst
   that we hope for the last restoring of all things; because he shall be
   far from us, until our minds ascend high above the world.

   Until the time of restoring As touching the force and cause, Christ
   hath already restored all things by his death; but the effect doth not
   yet fully appear; because that restoring is yet in the course, and se,
   consequently, our redemption, forasmuch as we do yet groan under the
   burden of servitude. For as the kingdom of Christ is only begun, and
   the perfection thereof is deferred until the last day, so those things
   which are annexed thereunto do now appear only in part. Therefore, if
   at this day we see many things confused in the world, let this hope set
   us upon foot and refresh us, that Christ shall once come that he may
   restore tall things. In the mean season, if we see the relics of sin
   hang on us, if we be environed on every side with divers miseries, if
   the world be full of wasting and scattering abroad, let us bewail these
   miseries, yet so that we uphold with the hope of restoring. And this is
   the reason why Christ doth not appear by and by, [191] because the
   warfare of the Church is not yet full, [192] whose time, seeing it is
   appointed by God, it is not for us to prevent the same. [193]

   Which he spoke. I do not expound this of the times alone, but I refer
   it unto the whole period; so that the sense is this: That whatsoever he
   had spoken before of the kingdom of Christ is witnessed by all the
   prophets. Certes, the gospel doth win no small credit hereby, that so
   soon as God began to show himself to the world, he did always set
   Christ before them; after that he began to speak unto the fathers, he
   did always lay this foundation of doctrine. By the same argument Paul
   commendeth the gospel, both in the beginning of his Epistle to the
   Romans, (Romans 1:1,) and also in the end, (Romans 16:25,) to wit, that
   it is no new thing, but promised even from the beginning. [194] This is
   true antiquity, which is able to purchase credit to doctrine: when as
   God himself is the author, the holy prophets the witnesses, and the
   continual course of times confirmeth the testimony. This confirmation
   was especially necessary for the Jews, who being brought up in the
   doctrine of the law, ought to admit nothing but that which agreeth
   therewith. Therefore Peter doth command them only to mind those things
   which the prophets have testified of Christ.

   Acts 3:22-24

   22. Moses truly said unto the fathers, The Lord your God shall raise up
   a Prophet unto you of your brethren, [like unto me;] him shall ye hear,
   according to all things which he shall speak unto you. 23. And it shall
   come to pass, that every soul which shall not hear that Prophet shall
   be destroyed of the people. 24. And all the prophets from Samuel, and
   thenceforth, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold these days.


   22. By this argument he proveth that he goeth not about to cause them
   to revolt from Moses, because it is a part of the law to take heed to
   and obey this chief teacher. Here might a doubt arise, why Peter
   thought it more convenient to cite this testimony of Moses than others,
   seeing there were many others in readiness far more plain; but he did
   this for this cause, because he intreateth in this place of the
   authority of doctrine; and this was the best way to bring the Jews to
   be Christ's disciples. For he should have preached in vain of all other
   things, unless they had been persuaded that his doctrine was reverently
   to be received. This is therefore the thing which Peter aimeth at, to
   bring them to hear Christ willingly, as the master whom God hath
   appointed to teach them.

   But here ariseth a question, which hath in it great difficulty; to wit,
   in that Peter applieth that unto the person of Christ which Moses spoke
   generally of the prophets. For although he make mention of a prophet in
   the singular number, yet the text [context] doth plainly declare, that
   he speaketh not of one alone; but that this word is put indefinitely.
   For after that Moses had forbidden the people to give themselves unto
   the superstitions of the Gentiles, by turning aside unto enchanters and
   soothsayers, he showeth them therewithal a remedy, whereby they may
   avoid all vanity; to wit, if they depend wholly upon the Word of God
   alone. By this means he promiseth that God will be careful at all times
   to send them prophets, that they may teach them aright. As if he should
   say, God will never suffer you to be destitute of prophets, of whom you
   may learn whatsoever shall be profitable for you to know. And Moses
   saith expressly, of thy brethren, to the end the Jews may know that the
   oracles of God are to be sought and set no where else, seeing that God
   had appointed unto them teachers of the kindred of Abraham. He addeth
   further, like unto me that they may know that they were not to hear God
   only at one time, or by the mouth of one man; but as God proceedeth to
   teach us by divers ministers throughout the continual course of time,
   so must we hold on in the obedience of the word. Now, the Jews were
   wont to reverence Moses; therefore, he will have them to give like
   honor to the prophets. I know that many would fain restrain it unto
   Christ. They catch at this word, whereas Moses doth testify that the
   prophet shall be like unto him, (Deuteronomy 18:15,) whereas,
   notwithstanding, it is written, that there arose none like unto Moses.
   I confess that there is in both places the same note of likeness, yet
   in a diverse sense. For, in the second place, the likeness or equality
   is expressed, as it doth plainly appear. They catch also at another
   thing, that the prophet shall far excel Moses, of whom he beareth
   witness as a crier or herald. But this is never a whit stronger,
   because Moses goeth about to bring to pass that the word of God may be
   believed by whomsoever it be brought.

   Therefore, there is no cause why we should set ourselves to be laughed
   to scorn by the Jews, by wresting the words of Moses violently, as if
   he spoke of Christ alone in this place. Yet we must see whether Peter
   doth cite the testimony fitly, whose authority ought to serve for a
   sound reason. I say; that in Peter's speech there is nothing which is
   not most convenient. For he saw that which all men ought to grant, that
   this testimony doth so appertain unto the other prophets, that yet
   notwithstanding it doth chiefly commend Christ, not only because that
   he is the prince and chief of all the prophets, but because all other
   former prophecies were directed toward him, and because God did at
   length speak absolutely by his mouth, For God spoke in divers manners,
   and at sundry times in times past3 unto our fathers by the prophets, he
   addeth the conclusion at length, in the last days in his only begotten
   Son, (Hebrews 1:1, 2.) Therefore, it came to pass, that they wanted
   prophets for a certain years [195] before his coming; which thing is
   plainly gathered out of the words of Malachi, who, after he hath
   commanded the people to be mindful of the law, he passeth over by and
   by unto John Baptist and unto Christ, as if he should say, that the
   prophecies are now ended until the last revelation come, (Malachi
   4:4-6;) according to that,

   "The law and the prophets prophesied until John; after that the kingdom
   of God is preached,"
   (Matthew 11:13.)

   And that was so common amongst the people, that the woman of Samaria
   could say, according to the common fame and opinion,

   "We know that the Messias shall come,
   who will teach us all things,"
   (John 4:25.)

   Therefore, we know that after the return of the people all the prophets
   ceased, to the end they might be made more attentive to hear Christ, by
   that silence or intermission of revelations. Therefore, Peter did not
   wrest this place, or abuse the same through ignorance, but he took that
   doctrine which all men had received for a principle; that God had
   promised to teach his people at the first by his prophets as by means,
   [196] but at length principally by Christ, at whose hands they were to
   hope for the perfect manifestation and laying open of all things. And
   to this purpose serveth that excellent testimony or commendation
   wherewith his Father setteth him forth, "Hear him," (Matthew 17:5.)

   23. Every soul. Here, by a most grievous punishment against the
   rebellious, the authority of all the prophets, but most of all of
   Christ, is established; and that for good causes. For seeing there is
   nothing that God doth account more precious than his word, it cannot be
   that he should suffer the same to be freely contemned. Therefore, if
   any man despised the law of Moses, he was adjudged to die the death.
   And hereunto Moses had respect when he said, "He shall be put away from
   among the people." For God had adopted the stock and kindred of Abraham
   unto himself, upon this condition, that this might be sufficient for
   them unto the chiefest felicity to be reckoned in that number, as it is
   said in the Psalm, "Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord." And
   in another place, "Blessed is the nation whom the Lord hath chosen to
   be his inheritance." Wherefore it is not to be doubted, but that he
   pronounceth that he shall be blotted out of the book of life whosoever
   shall refuse to hear Christ. For he is not worthy to be accounted one
   of the Church, whosoever he be that refuseth to have him to be his
   Master, by whom alone God doth teach us, and by whom he will have us to
   hear himself; and he cutteth himself away from the body, whosoever he
   be that refuseth to be under the Head.

   24. And all When as he saith that all the prophets do with one consent
   send their scholars unto Christ, that appeareth more plainly hereby,
   which I said, that the commendation of the gospel is contained under
   that testimony of Moses, and so, consequently, that the conclusion of
   prophecies is principally noted. Again, this maketh much for the
   certainty of the gospel, that all the prophets, for a long time,
   [series of ages,] do yet, notwithstanding, so temper their form of
   teaching with one consent, that they do testify altogether that men
   ought to hope for a certain, better, and more perfect thing. Therefore,
   whosoever will believe Moses and the prophets, he must needs submit
   himself unto the doctrine of Christ, without which all that is lame and
   imperfect which they taught, (John 5:47.)

   Acts 3:25-26

   25. You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God
   made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shalt all
   families of the earth be blessed. 26. God raised up unto you first his
   Son Jesus, and he sent him, blessing you, whilst that he doth turn away
   every one from his sins.


   25. You are the children. He signifieth that the grace of the covenant
   was appointed principally for them, which covenant God made with their
   fathers. And so as he pricked them forward to obey the gospel, by
   terrifying them with the terror of punishment, so he allureth them now
   again to receive the grace which is offered them in Christ; so that we
   see how that God omitteth nothing whereby he may bring us unto himself.
   And it is the duty of a wise minister so to prick forward the sluggish
   and slow bellies, that he do lead those gently which are apt to be
   taught; we must also note diligently this course of teaching, where
   Peter showeth that the gospel is assigned and appointed unto the Jews.
   For it is not sufficient to have the mercy of God preached unto us
   generally, unless we also know that the same is offered unto us by the
   certain ordinance of God. For this cause is it that Paul standeth so
   much upon the avouching of the calling of the Gentiles, (Romans 15:18;
   Ephesians 3:3, 4;) because, if any man should think that the gospel
   came unto him by chance, when as it was scattered here and there, faith
   should quail; [197] yea, there should be a doubtful opinion instead of
   faith. Therefore, to the end we may steadfastly believe the promise of
   salvation, this application (that I may so term it) is necessary, that
   God doth not cast forth uncertain voices, that they may hang in the
   air, but that he doth direct the same unto us by his certain and
   determinate counsel. Peter telleth the Jews, that Christ is promised
   unto them after this sort, to the end they may more willingly embrace
   him. And how proveth he this? because they are the children of the
   prophets and of the covenant. He calleth them the children of the
   prophets, which were of the same nation, and therefore were heirs of
   the covenant, which did belong unto the whole body of the people. For
   he argueth thus: God made his covenant with our fathers; therefore we,
   which are their posterity, are comprehended in the covenant.

   Whereby the doubting [doting] subtlety of the Anabaptists is refuted,
   who do expound the children of Abraham only allegorically; as if God
   had had no respect to his stock, when he said, "I will be the God of
   thy seed," (Genesis 17:7.) Certainly Peter doth not speak in this place
   of the shadows of the law; but he affirmeth that this is of force under
   the kingdom of Christ, that God doth adopt the children together with
   the fathers; and so, consequently, the grace of salvation may be
   extended unto those which are as yet unborn, (Romans 9:7.) I grant,
   indeed, that many which are the children of the faithful, according to
   the flesh, are counted bastards, and not legitimate, because they
   thrust themselves out of the holy progeny through their unbelief. But
   this doth no whit hinder the Lord from calling and admitting the seed
   of the godly into fellowship of grace. And so, although the common
   election be not effectual in all, yet may it set open a gate for the
   special elect. As Paul intreateth in the 11th to the Romans, (Romans
   11:23,) whence we must set [seek] an answer for this question.

   And in thy seed He proveth that the covenant was made with the fathers,
   because God said unto Abraham,

   "In thy seed shall all nations be blessed," (Genesis 22:18.)

   But if we admit Paul's interpretation, this testimony shall make
   nothing for the present cause. Paul teacheth that Christ is this seed,
   (Galatians 3:16.) If the blessing be promised to all mankind by Christ,
   what is this to the especial or particular privilege of one nation?
   Secondly, Peter himself seemeth shortly after to subscribe to this
   exposition of Paul, when as he saith that Christ was sent, that in him
   the Jews may be blessed. For this could not be, unless Christ were that
   blessed seed. I answer, When Paul referreth it unto Christ, he standeth
   not upon the word seed, but he hath respect to an higher tiling; to
   wit, that it cannot be one seed, unless it be united and knit together
   in Christ, as in the Head. For Ismael and Isaac, although both of them
   be the sons of Abraham, yet do they not make one seed, because they be
   divided into two people. Therefore, though many be estranged from the
   family of Abraham, which came of hint according to the flesh, yet Moses
   noteth one certain body, when he promiseth the blessing unto the seed
   of Abraham. And whence cometh the unity, save only from the Head, which
   is Christ? In this sense doth Paul understand this word seed of Christ,
   although it be a noun collective; because, if you depart from hint, the
   posterity of Abraham shall be as torn members, neither shall there be
   any thing else in them, save only mere wasteless and scattering abroad.
   Peter agreeth with that doctrine, because he doth so extend the
   blessing unto all the people, that he doth, nevertheless, seek the
   fountain in Christ.

   Secondly, forasmuch as the Jews do what they can to wring [wrest] from
   us this testimony, the godly readers must arm themselves against their
   cavils; and so much the rather, because Christian writers have been too
   slack in this point, as I have said in the Epistle to the Galatians.
   First, as touching the word seed, there is no cause wily they should
   prattle that Paul doth not rightly restrain it unto Christ; for he doth
   not this simply, but in that respect whereof I have spoken. In which
   point, I confess, both our Latin and Greek interpreters have erred.
   Now, we must see what this manner of speech doth import. The Gentiles
   shall be blessed in the seed of Abraham. Our men think that there is
   some cause noted; to wit, that through that seed the Gentiles shall be
   blessed. The Jews toss this to and fro, because this phrase signifieth
   every where in the Scriptures, an example or similitude; as, on the
   other side, [198] to be cursed in Sodom, in Israel, or in another
   people, is to take them for a notable example of a curse. I answer,
   that it is a doubtful speech, and taken diversely, according to the
   circumstance of the places, which the Jews do craftily dissemble. For
   they gather many places, out of which they prove that there is a
   comparison made; as if it should be said, The Gentiles shall desire to
   be blessed, like to the seed of Abraham. But when as the Scripture
   saith elsewhere, "They shall bless themselves in the living God," as
   Jeremiah 4:2; Isaiah 65:16; and again, "Do bless in the name of the
   Lord," (Deuteronomy 10:8,) and in other such like places; who doth not
   see that there is a cause expressed? Therefore, I say that this form of
   speech ought to be understood according to the circumstances of the
   places.

   And now, forasmuch as I have declared that the seed of Abraham can be
   found nowhere else save only in Christ, it remaineth that we consider
   of what sort the office of Christ is. So shall it appear, undoubtedly,
   that he is not made a bare example or pattern, but that the blessing is
   truly promised to him; because without him we be all accursed. Yet
   there remaineth one doubt; for certain both these are spoken in one
   sense, They shall be blessed in thee, and in thy seed; but Abraham was
   nothing else but a type or mirror of the blessing. I answer, that in
   the person of Abraham, that body is also noted out, which dependeth
   upon one head, and is knit together in the same.

   All the families The Jews do grossly expound this, That all nations
   shall desire to be blessed, as the seed of Abraham. But we say
   otherwise, That they shall be engrafted into the society. For the name
   of Abraham tendeth to this end, because it should come to pass that God
   should gather all people [199] unto him. Also, when the prophets will
   declare the force hereof, they foretell everywhere that the inheritance
   of salvation shall be common to the Gentiles. And hereby it appeareth
   that the covenant of God, which was then proper to the Jews alone, is
   not only common to all men, but is made with us expressly; otherwise,
   we could not conceive that hope of salvation which is firm enough out
   of the gospel. Therefore, let us not suffer this promise to be wrung
   from us, which is, as it were, a solemn declaration, whereby the Lord
   maketh us his heirs together with the fathers. Whereunto Peter also had
   respect, when as he saith shortly after, that Christ was first sent
   unto the Jews; for he doth signify that the Gentiles also have their
   order, though it be secondary.

   26. He hath raised up his Son. He gathereth out of the words of Moses
   that Christ is now revealed. But the words do seem to import no such
   thing; yet doth he reason fitly thus, because the blessing could no
   otherwise be, unless the beginning thereof did flow from the Messias.
   For we must always remember this, that all mankind is accursed, and,
   therefore, there is a singular remedy promised us, which is performed
   by Christ alone. Wherefore, he is the only fountain and beginning of
   the blessing. And if so be that Christ came to this end, that he may
   bless the Jews first, and, secondly, us, he hath undoubtedly done that
   which was his duty to do; and we shall feel the force and effect of
   this duty in ourselves, unless our unbelief do hinder us.

   This was a part of the priest's office under the law, to bless the
   people; and, lest this should be only a vain ceremony, there was a
   promise added; as it is, (Numbers 6:27.) And that which was shadowed in
   the old priesthood was truly performed in Christ, (Hebrews 7:1, 6.)
   Concerning which matter we have spoken more at large in the seventh
   chapter to the Hebrews. I like not Erasmus's translation; for he saith,
   when he had raised him up, as if he spoke of a thing which was done
   long ago. But Peter meaneth rather, that Christ was raised up, when he
   was declared to be the author of the blessing; which thing, since it
   was done of late and suddenly, it ought to move their minds the more.
   For the Scripture useth to speak thus, as in the last place, of Moses,
   whereunto Peter alludeth. To raise up a prophet, is to furnish him with
   necessary gifts to fulfill his function, and, as it were, to prefer him
   to the degree of prophetical honor. And Christ was raised up then, when
   he fulfilled the function enjoined him by his Father, but the same
   thing is done daily when he is offered by the gospel, that he may excel
   amongst us. We have said that in the adverb of order, first, is noted
   the right of the first-be-gotten, because it was expedient that Christ
   should begin with the Jews, that he might afterward pass over unto the
   Gentiles.

   Whilst that he turneth. He doth again commend the doctrine of
   repentance, to the end we may learn to conclude under the blessing of
   Christ newness of life, as when Esaias promiseth that a "Redeemer
   should come to Zion," he addeth a restraint; [200] "Those which in
   Jacob shall be turned from their iniquities." For Christ doth not do
   away the sins of the faithful, to the end they may grant liberty to
   themselves to sin under this color; but he maketh them therewith all
   new men. Although we must diligently distinguish these two benefits
   which are linked together, that this ground-work may continue, that we
   are reconciled to God by free pardon, I know that other men turn it
   otherwise; but this is the true meaning of Luke; for he speaketh thus
   word for word, "In turning every one from his wickedness."

   CHAPTER 4

   In this narration we must consider three things chiefly. That so soon
   as the truth of the gospel doth once appear, Satan setteth himself
   against the same on the other side, so much as he is able, and
   attempteth all things that he may smolder the same in the very first
   beginnings. Secondly, That God doth furnish his children with
   invincible force and strength, [201] that they may stand steadfast and
   unmovable against all assaults of Satan, and not yield unto the
   violence of the wicked. And, last of all, we must note the event and
   end, that howsoever the adversaries seem to bear the chiefest swing,
   and they themselves do omit nothing which may serve to blot out the
   name of Christ; and, on the other side, howsoever the ministers of
   sound doctrine be as sheep in the mouths of wolves, yet doth God spread
   abroad the kingdom of his Son; he fostereth the light of the gospel
   which is lighted; and he is the protector of his children. Therefore,
   so often as the doctrine of the gospel ariseth, and divers motions do
   rise on the other side, and the course thereof is letted divers ways,
   there is no cause why godly minds should faint or quail, as at some
   unwonted thing; but they ought rather to remember, that these are
   ordinary endeavors of Satan, so that we must think upon this well
   before it come to pass, that it cannot otherwise be but that Satan will
   spew out all his might and main, so often as Christ doth come abroad
   with his doctrine. And therewithal let us consider that the constancy
   of the apostles is set forth unto us for an example, lest, being
   overcome either with any perils, or threatenings, or terrors, we leap
   back from that profession of faith which the Lord requireth at our
   hands. And, moreover, let us comfort ourselves with this, that we need
   not to doubt but that the Lord will give prosperous success when we
   have done our duty faithfully.

   Acts 4:1-4

   1. And as they spoke unto the people, the priests and the governor of
   the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 2. Taking it grievously
   that they taught the people, and preached, in Jesus' name, the
   resurrection from the dead. 3. And they laid hands on them, and they
   put them in prison until the morrow. For it was now even. tide. 4. And
   many of those which heard the word believed; and the number of men
   there was about five thousand.


   1. And as they spoke Hereby it appeareth how watchful the wicked be,
   because they are always ready at an inch to stop the mouth of the
   servants of Christ. And, undoubt edly, they came together, as it were,
   to quench some great fire; which thing Luke signifieth, when as he
   saith that the ruler or captain of the temple came also; and he addeth,
   moreover, that they took it grievously that the apostles did teach.
   Therefore, they came not upon them by chance, but of set purpose, that,
   according to their authority, they might restrain the apostles, and put
   them to silence. And yet they have some show of law and equity; for if
   any man did rashly intrude himself, it was the office of the high
   priest to repress him; and also in like sort, to keep the people in the
   obedience of the law and the prophets, and to prevent all new
   doctrines. Therefore, when they hear unknown men, and such as had no
   public authority, preaching unto the people in the temple, they seem,
   according as their office did require, and they were commanded by God,
   to address themselves to remedy this. And surely, at the first blush,
   it seemeth that there was nothing in this action worthy of
   reprehension, but the end doth at length declare that their counsel was
   wicked, and their affection ungodly.

   Again, it was a hard matter for the apostles to escape infamy and
   reproach, because they, being private and despised persons, did take
   upon them public authority; to wit, because, when things are out of
   order, many things must be essayed to [against] the common custom, and
   especially, when we are to avouch and defend religion and the worship
   of God, and the ringleaders themselves do stop all ways, and do abuse
   that office against God, which was committed unto them by God. The
   faithful champions of Christ must swallow up and pass through this
   ignominy in [under] Popery. For a thousand summers will go over their
   heads before any reformation or amendment will wax ripe amongst them
   for the better. Therefore, Luke standeth upon this point, when as he
   saith that they were grieved because the resurrection was preached in
   the name of Christ. For hereupon it followeth that they did hate the
   doctrine before they knew the same. He expresseth the Sadducees by
   name, as those which were more courageous [202] in this cause. For they
   were almost [usually] a part of the priests; but because the question
   is about the resurrection, they set themselves against the apostles
   more than the rest. Furthermore, this was most monstrous confusion
   amongst the Jews, in that this sect, which was profane, was of such
   authority. For what godliness could remain, when as the immortality of
   the soul was counted as a fable, and that freely? But men must needs
   run headlong after this sort, when they have once suffered pure
   doctrine to fall to the ground amongst them. Wherefore, we must so much
   the more diligently beware of every wicked turning aside, lest such a
   step do follow immediately.

   Some men think that the ruler of the temple was chosen from among the
   priests, but I do rather think that he was some chief captain of the
   Roman army; for it was a place which was fortified both naturally and
   artificially. Again, Herod had built a tower there, which was called
   Antonia; so that it is to be thought that he had placed there a band of
   soldiers, and that the Roman captain had the government of the temple,
   lest it should be a place of refuge for the Jews, if they had stirred
   up any tumult, which we may likewise gather out of Josephus. And this
   agreeth very well, that the enemies of Christ did crave the help of the
   secular power, under color of appeasing some tumult. In the mean
   season, they seek favor at the hands of the Romans, as if they were
   careful to maintain the right of their empire.

   4. And many of them which heard The apostles are put in prison, but the
   force of their preaching is spread far and wide, and the course thereof
   is at liberty. Of which thing Paul boasteth very much, that the Word of
   God is not bound with him, (2 Timothy 2:9.) And here we see that Satan
   and the wicked have liberty granted them to rage against the children
   of God; yet can they not (maugre their heads [203] ) prevail, but that
   God doth further and promote the kingdom of his Son; Christ doth gather
   together his sheep; and that a few men unarmed, furnished with no
   garrisons, do show forth more power in their voice alone, than all the
   world, by raging against them. This is, indeed, no common work of God,
   that one sermon brought forth such plentiful fruit; but this is the
   more to be wondered at, that the faithful are not terrified with the
   present danger, and discouraged from taking up the cross of Christ
   together with the faith. For this was a hard beginning for novices.
   Christ did more evidently declare by this efficacy and force of
   doctrine that he was alive, than if he should have offered his body to
   be handled with hand, and to be seen with the eyes. And whereas it is
   said that the number of those which believed did grow to be about five
   thousand, I do not understand it of those which were newly added, but
   of the whole church.

   Acts 4: 5-12

   5. And it came to pass, that the next day their rulers, and elders, and
   scribes, were gathered together at Jerusalem. 6. And Annas the high
   priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and so many as were of
   the kindred of the priests, 7. And when they had set them before them,
   they asked them, In what power, or in what name, have ye done that? 8.
   Then Peter, being filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers
   of the people, and elders of Israel, 9. If we be judged this day for
   healing the man which was lame, by what means he is made whole: 10. Be
   it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the
   name of Jesus Christ of. Nazareth, whom ye have crucified, whom God
   hath raised up from the dead, this man standeth before you whole. 11.
   This is the stone which was refused of you the builders; it is placed
   in the head of the corner. 12. Neither is there salvation in any other.
   Neither is there any other name given under heaven unto men, wherein we
   must be saved.


   5. It is a thing worthy to be noted in this place, that the wicked do
   omit no subtilty that they may blot out the gospel and the name of
   Christ, and yet do they not obtain that which they hoped for; because
   God doth make their counsels frustrate. For they make an assembly,
   wherein they do all things so tyrannously, that yet, notwithstanding,
   lust beareth a show of right, and liberty is driven far away, and at
   length the truth may seem to be condemned by good right. But the Lord
   bringeth upon them a sudden fear, so that they dare not do that which
   they can, and which they do most of all desire. Whatsoever the apostles
   shall bring in defense of their cause, that shall remain buried and
   shut up with the walls, where there is none which doth bear them any
   favor. And therefore there is no place left for the truth. Yet we see
   how the Lord bringeth their counsel to nought, whilst that being kept
   back with fear of the people, they stay themselves and bridle their
   fury, to the end they may avoid envy. But I marvel much why Luke doth
   make Annas the highest priest in this place, seeing that it appeareth
   by Josephus, that this honor was not taken from Caiaphas until
   Vitellius had entered Jerusalem to bear rule, after that Pilate was
   commanded to depart unto Rome. All men grant that the Lord was
   crucified in the eighteenth year of Tiberius. And that empire [the
   reign of Tiberius] did continue four years longer. And it must needs
   be, that there were three years complete, after the death of Christ,
   before Pilate was put from the office of the pro-consul. For when
   Tiberius was dead he came to Rome; so that Caiaphas was high priest yet
   three years after the death of Christ. Wherefore it is to be thought,
   that that whereof Luke speaketh in this place did not happen
   immediately after the resurrection of Christ; although the doubt cannot
   thus be answered. [204] For Josephus reporteth, that Jonathas was
   chosen into the place of Caiaphas; but because this Jonathas was the
   son of Annas, it is a thing not unlike to be true, that the son was
   called by the name of the father; as Caiaphas also had two names; for
   they did also call him Joseph.

   7. In what power They do yet seem to have some zeal of God. For they
   feign that they are careful that the honor due unto God may not be
   given to any other. Name is taken in this place for authority. In sum,
   they deal as if they were most earnest defenders and maintainers of
   God's glory. In the mean season, their importunateness is wonderful, in
   that they go about to drive the apostles to make denial, by asking many
   questions concerning a manifest matter, and to wring out by fear some
   other thing than they had confessed. But God doth bring their crafty
   wiliness to nought, and maketh them hear that which they would not.

   8. Peter, being filled with the Holy Ghost It is not without great
   cause that Luke addeth this, to the end we may know that Peter spake
   not with such a majesty of himself. And surely, seeing he had denied
   his Master, Christ, being afraid at the voice of a silly woman,
   (Matthew 26:70,) he should have utterly fainted in such an assembly,
   when he did only behold their pomp, unless he had been upholden by the
   power of the Spirit. He had great need of wisdom and strength. [205] He
   excelleth in both these so much, that his answer is indeed divine. He
   is another manner of man here than he was before. Furthermore, this
   profiteth us two manner of ways. For this title, or commendation, is of
   no small force to set forth the doctrine which shall follow
   immediately, when it is said that it came from the Holy God, [Spirit.]
   And we are taught to crave at the hands of the Lord the Spirit of
   wisdom and strength, when we make profession of our faith, to direct
   our hearts and minds. The fullness of the Spirit is taken for a large
   and no common measure.

   9. If we be judged. Undoubtedly Peter layeth tyranny to the charge of
   the priests and the scribes, because they examine them unjustly
   concerning a benefit which deserveth praise, as if he and his fellow
   had committed some heinous offense. If, saith he, we be accused for
   this cause, because we have made a sick man whole. Peter hath in this
   place more respect unto the wicked affection of the mind than unto the
   very order of the question. For if, under color of a miracle, the
   apostles would have drawn away the people from the true and sincere
   worship of God, they should have been worthily called to answer for
   themselves; because religion doth far excel all the good things of this
   present life. But seeing they (having no cause at all) did wickedly
   make an offense of that which they ought to have honored, Peter, being
   supported with this confidence, doth at the first gird them wittily
   with a taunting preface, because they sit as judges to condemn good
   deeds. Yet he toucheth this point but lightly, that he may pass over
   unto the matter.

   10. Be it known unto you. Peter might (as I have already said) have
   turned aside unto many starting-holes, [206] if he would not have
   entered the cause; [207] but because the miracle was wrought, to this
   end, that the name of Christ might be glorified, he descendeth by and
   by unto this. For he knew that he was the minister of such excellent
   power of God, that he might have a seal to confirm his doctrine. In the
   meanwhile, the wicked, will they, nil they, are enforced to hear that
   which they would have had buried full deep. When they have done what
   they can, this is all; they cause Peter to avouch and object to their
   faces, that wherewith they were so grieved, when it was spoken to
   others. And, first he maketh Christ the author of the miracle.
   Secondly, because it seemed to be an absurd and incredible thing, that
   a dead man should be endued with divine power, he testifieth that
   Christ is alive, because God hath raised him up from the dead,
   howsoever they had crucified him. So that the miracle giveth him
   occasion to preach the resurrection of Christ. And by this testimony
   Peter meant to prove that he was the true Messias. He saith that they
   had crucified him, not only to the end he may upbraid this unto them,
   that they may acknowledge their fault; but also that they may
   understand that they have in vain striven against God; and so,
   consequently, cease to rage so unluckily and with such deadly success.

   11. This is the stone. He confirmeth by testimony of Scripture that it
   is no new thing that the ringleaders [208] of the Church, which have
   glorious titles given them, and have the chief room in the temple of
   God, have, notwithstanding, wickedly rejected Christ. Therefore he
   citeth a place out of the 118th Psalm, (Psalm 118:22,) where David
   complaineth that he is rejected of the captains [leaders] of the
   people, and yet, notwithstanding, he boasteth that he was chosen of God
   to have the chief room. Moreover, he compareth the Church, or the state
   of the kingdom, by an usual metaphor to a building, he calleth those
   which have the government the masters of the work, [209] and he maketh
   himself the principal stone, whereon the whole building is stayed and
   grounded. For that is meant by the head of the corner. Therefore, this
   is David's comfort, that howsoever the captains have rejected him, so
   that they would not grant him even the basest place, yet did not their
   wicked and ungodly endeavors hinder him from being extolled by God unto
   the highest degree of honor. But that was shadowed in David which God
   would have perfectly expressed in the Messias. Therefore Peter dealeth
   very aptly when as he citeth this testimony, as being spoken before of
   Christ, as they knew full well that it did agree properly to him. Now
   we know to what end Peter did cite the Psalm; to wit, lest the elders
   and priests being unadvisedly puffed up with their honor, should take
   to themselves authority and liberty to allow or disallow whatsoever
   they would. For it is evident that the stone refused by the chief
   builders is placed by God's own hand in the chief place, that it may
   support the whole house.

   Furthermore, this happeneth not once only, but it must be fulfilled
   daily; at least it must seem no new thing if the chief builders do even
   now reject Christ. Whereby the vain boasting of the Pope is plainly
   refuted, who maketh his boast of the bare title, that he may usurp
   whatsoever is Christ's. Admit we grant to the Pope and his horned
   beasts that which they desire, to wit, that they are appointed to be
   ordinary pastors of the Church, they can go no farther at length than
   to be called chief builders with Annas and Caiaphas. And it is evident
   what account ought to be made of this title, which they think is
   sufficient to mix heaven and earth together. Now let us gather out of
   this place some things which are worth the noting. Forasmuch as they
   are called master-builders who have government of the Church, the name
   itself putteth them in mind of their duty. Therefore, let them give
   themselves wholly to the building of the temple of God. And because all
   men do not their duty faithfully as they ought, let them see what is
   the best manner of building aright, to wit, let them retain Christ for
   the foundation; that done, let them not mix straw and stubble in this
   building, but let them make the whole building of pure doctrine; as
   Paul teacheth in 1 Corinthians 3:12. Whereas God is said to have
   extolled Christ, who was rejected of the builders, this ought to
   comfort us, when as we see even the pastors of the Church, or, at
   least, those which are in great honor, wickedly rebel against Christ,
   that they may banish him. For we may safely set light by those visors
   which they object against us; so that we need not fear to give Christ
   that humor which God doth give to him. But if he wink for a time, yet
   doth he laugh at the boldness of his enemies from on high, whilst they
   rage and fret upon earth. Furthermore, though their conspiracies be
   strong and well guarded with all aids, yet must we always assure
   ourselves of this, that Christ's honor shall remain safe and sound. And
   let the fruit of this confidence ensue also, that we be valiant and
   without fear in maintaining the kingdom of Christ, whereof God will be
   an invincible defender, as he himself affirmeth.

   We have already spoken of Peter's constancy, in that one simple man,
   having such envious judges, and yet having but one partner in the
   present danger, showeth no token at all of fear, but doth freely
   confess in that raging and furious company, that thing which he knew
   would be received with most contrary minds. And whereas he sharply
   upbraideth unto them that wickedness which they had committed, we must
   let [seek] from hence a rule of speech when we have to deal with the
   open enemies of the truth. For we must beware of two faults on this
   behalf, that we seem not to flatter by keeping silence or winking; for
   that were treacherous silence, whereby the truth should be betrayed.
   Again, that we be not puffed up with wantonness, or immoderate heat as
   men's minds do oftentimes break out more than they ought in contention.
   Therefore, let us use gravity in this point, yet such as is moderate;
   let us chide freely, yet without all heat of railing. We see that Peter
   did observe this order. For at the first he giveth an honorable title;
   when he is once come to the matter he inveigheth sharply against them;
   neither could such ungodliness as theirs was be concealed. Those which
   shall follow this example shall not only have Peter to be their guide,
   but also the Spirit of God.

   12. Neither is there salvation in any other. He passeth from the
   species [salvation] unto the genus, [or more particular,] and he goeth
   from the corporal benefit unto perfect health, [or general.] And
   assuredly Christ had showed this one token of his grace, to the end he
   might be known to be the only author of life. We must consider this in
   all the benefits of God, to wit, that he is the fountain of salvation.
   And he meant to prick and sting the priests with this sentence, when as
   he saith that there is salvation in none other save only in Christ,
   whom they went about to put quite out of remembrance. [210] As if he
   should say, that they are twice damned who did not only refuse the
   salvation offered them by God, but endeavor to bring the same to
   nought, and did take from all the people the fruit and use thereof. And
   although he seemeth to speak unto deaf men, yet doth he preach of the
   grace of Christ, if peradventure some can abide to hear; if not, that
   they may at least be deprived of all excuse by this testimony.

   Neither is there any other name He expoundeth the sentence next going
   before. Salvation (saith he) is in Christ alone, because God hath
   decreed that it should be so. For by name he meaneth the cause or mean,
   as if he should have said, forasmuch as salvation is in God's power
   only, he will not have the same to be common to us by any other means
   than if we ask it of Christ alone. Whereas he saith under heaven, they
   do commonly refer it unto creatures, as if he should say, that the
   force and power to save is given to Christ alone. Notwithstanding, I do
   rather think that this was added, because men cannot ascend into
   heaven, that they may come unto God. Therefore, seeing we are so far
   from the kingdom of God, it is needful that God do not only invite us
   unto himself, but that reaching out his hand he offer salvation unto
   us, that we may enjoy the same. Peter teacheth in this place, that he
   hath done that in Christ, because he came down into the earth for this
   cause, that he might bring salvation with him, Neither is that contrary
   to this doctrine, that Christ is ascended above all heavens, (Ephesians
   4:10.) For he took upon him our flesh once for this cause, that he
   might be a continual pledge of our adoption. He hath reconciled the
   Father to us for ever by the sacrifice of his death: by his
   resurrection he hath purchased for us eternal life. And he is present
   with us now also, that he may make us partakers of the fruit of eternal
   redemption; but the revealing of salvation is handled in this place,
   and we know that the same was so revealed in Christ, that we need not
   any longer to say, "Who shall ascend into heaven?" (Romans 10:6.) And
   if so be this doctrine were deeply imprinted in the minds of all men,
   then should so many controversies concerning the causes of salvation be
   soon at an end, wherewith the Church is so much troubled. The Papists
   confess with us, that salvation is in God alone, but by and by they
   forge to themselves infinite ways to attain unto the same. But Peter
   calleth us back unto Christ alone. They dare not altogether deny that
   we have salvation given us by Christ; but whilst they feign so many
   helps, they leave him scarce the hundredth part of salvation. But they
   were to seek for salvation at the hands of Christ wholly; for when
   Peter excludeth plainly all other means, he placeth perfect salvation
   in Christ alone, and not some part thereof only. So that they are far
   from understanding this doctrine.

   Acts 4:13-18

   13. And when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and considered
   that they were men unlearned and ignorant, they wondered; and they knew
   them, that they had been with Jesus. 14. And when they saw the man that
   had been healed standing with them, they could not say against it. 15.
   But when they had commanded them to depart out of the council, they
   consulted among themselves, 16. Saying, What shall we do to these men?
   For a manifest sign is done by them, and it is openly known to all the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem; neither can we deny it. 17. But lest it be
   noised any farther among the people, in threatening let us threaten
   them, that they speak not henceforth to any man in this name. 18. And
   then when they had called them, they charged them that they should not
   speak at all, or teach, in the name of Jesus.


   13. Here may we see an evil conscience; for being destitute of right
   and reason, they break out into open tyranny, the hatred whereof they
   had essayed to escape. Therefore, he doth first declare that they were
   convict, that it may appear that they did war against God wittingly and
   willingly like giants. For they see a manifest work of his in the man
   which was healed, and yet do they wickedly set themselves against him.
   In as much as they know that Peter and John were men unlearned and
   ignorant, they acknowledge that there was somewhat more than belongeth
   to man in their boldness; therefore they are enforced to wonder whether
   they will or no. Yet they break out into such impudence, that they fear
   not to seek some tyrannous means to oppress the truth. When as they
   confess that it is a manifest sign, they condemn themselves therein of
   an evil conscience. When they say that it is known to all men, they
   declare that passing over God they have respect unto men only. For they
   betray their want of shame thereby, that they would not have doubted to
   turn their back if there had been any color of denial. And when they
   ask what they shall do, they make their obstinate wickedness known unto
   all men. For they would have submitted themselves unto God, unless
   devilish fury had carried them away to some other purpose. This is the
   spirit of giddiness and madness, therewith God doth make his enemies
   drunk. So when they hope shortly after that they can by threatenings
   bring it about, that the same shall go no farther, what can be more
   foolish? For after they have put two simple men to silence, shall the
   arm of God be broken?

   17. In threatening let us threaten. Here may we see what a deadly evil
   power void of the fear of God is. For when that religion and reverence
   which ought doth not reign, the more holy the place is which a man doth
   possess, the more boldly [211] doth he rage. For which cause we
   [should] always take good heed that the wicked be not preferred unto
   the government of the Church. And those which are called to this
   function must behave themselves reverently and modestly, lest they seem
   to be armed to do hurt. But and if it so happen they abuse their honor,
   the Spirit declareth there, as in a glass, what small account we ought
   to make of their decrees and commandments. [212] The authority of the
   pastors hath certain bounds appointed which they may not pass. And if
   they dare be so bold, we may lawfully refuse to obey them; for if we
   should, it were in us great wickedness, as it followeth now.

   Acts 4:19-23

   19. And Peter and John answered them, and said, Whether it be right in
   the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than to God, judge ye. 20.
   For we cannot but speak those things which we have seen and heard. 21.
   And when they had threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing.
   for which they might punish them, because of the people; for all men
   did glorify God because of that which was done. 22. For the man was
   more than forty years old on whom the sign of healing was showed. 23.
   Furthermore, when they were let go, they came to their fellows, and
   told them whatsoever things the priests and elders had said.


   19. Whether it be right. Let us remember to whom they make this answer.
   For this council did undoubtedly represent the Church; but because they
   do abuse their authority, the apostles say flatly that they are not to
   be obeyed. And (as men use to do in an evident matter) they refer over
   the judgment unto their adversaries for a reproach unto them.
   Furthermore it is worth the noting, that they set the authority of God
   against their decrees; which thing should be done out of season, unless
   they were the enemies of God, who notwithstanding, were otherwise the
   ordinary pastors of the Church. Moreover, the apostles express a
   farther thing also to wit, that the obedience which men use toward evil
   and unfaithful pastors, howsoever they hold the lawful government of
   the Church, is contrary to God. This question doth the Pope answer
   pleasantly, [213] because he saith that all those things are divine
   oracles whatsoever it hath pleased him to blunder out un-advisedly.
   [214] By this means the danger of contrariety is taken away. But the
   bishops can challenge no more at this day than God had given then to
   the order of the priests. Therefore, this is a toy too childish, [viz.]
   that they can command nothing but that which is agreeable to the
   commandment of God. [215] Yea, rather the thing itself declareth
   evidently that there shall be no conflict then if they suffer their
   vain and unbridled lust to range freely, having vanquished and
   renounced the doctrine of Christ.

   Therefore, by what title soever men be called, yet must we hear them
   only upon this condition, if they lead us not away from obeying God. So
   that we must examine all their traditions by the rule of the Word of
   God. We must obey princes and others which are in authority, yet so
   that they rob not God (who is the chief King, Father, and Lord) of his
   right and authority. If we must observe such modesty in politic [civil]
   government, it ought to be of far more force in the spiritual
   government of the Church. And lest, according to their wonted pride,
   they think that their authority is abated, when God is extolled above
   them, Peter draweth them away from such pleasant flattering of
   themselves, telling them that this matter must be determined before the
   judgment-seat of God; for he saith plainly before [in the sight of]
   God; because, howsoever men be blinded, yet will God never suffer any
   man to be preferred before him. And surely the Spirit did put this
   answer in the mouth of the apostles, not only to the end he might
   repress the furiousness of the enemies, but that he might also teach us
   what we ought to do, so often as men become so proud, that having
   shaken off the yoke of God, they will lay their own yoke upon us.
   Therefore, let us then remember this holy authority of God, which is
   able to drive away the vain smoke of all man's excellency.

   20. For we cannot Many things which are found out by hearing and seeing
   may, yea, ought to be concealed, when as the question is concerning the
   redeeming of peace. For this is a point of discourtesy and of wicked
   stubbornness to move and raise a tumult about unnecessary matters; but
   the apostles do not speak generally, when as they say they cannot but
   speak. For the gospel of Christ is now in hand, wherein consisteth both
   the glory of God and the salvation of men. It is an unmeet thing, and
   sacrilegious wickedness, that the same should be suppressed by
   prohibitions and menacings [216] of men; for God commandeth that his
   gospel be preached, especially since they did know that they were
   chosen to be witnesses and preachers of Christ, and that God had opened
   their mouth. Therefore, whosoever putteth them to silence, he
   endeavoreth so much as he is able to abolish the grace of God, and
   fordo [destroy] the salvation of men. And if so be that a prohibition
   so wicked do stop our mouths, woe be to our sluggishness. Now, let all
   men see what confession God requireth at their hands, lest, when they
   keep silence because of men, they hear a fearful voice proceed out of
   the mouth of Christ, whereby their unfaithfulness shall be condemned.
   And as for those which are called unto the office of teaching, let them
   be terrified with no threatenings of men, with no color of authority,
   but let them execute [217] that office which they know is enjoined them
   by God. Woe be unto me, saith Paul, if I preach not the gospel, because
   the function is committed unto me, (1 Corinthians 9:10.) Neither ought
   we only to set this commandment of God against the tyrannous
   commandments of men, but also against all lets which Satan doth
   oftentimes thrust in to break off and hinder the course of the gospel.
   For we have need of a strong buckler to bear off such sore assaults,
   which all the ministers of Christ do feel; but howsoever we speed, this
   is a brazen wall, that the preaching of the gospel doth please God, and
   therefore that it can for no cause be suppressed.

   21. And when they had threatened them. And here is the end of sedition,
   that the wicked cease not to breathe out their fury, yet are they
   bridled by the secret power of God, so that they cannot tell how to do
   any hurt. [218] How is it that being content with threatenings, they do
   not also rage against their bodies, save only because the power of God
   doth bind them as a chain? Not that the fear of God doth prevail with
   them, for it is the regard of the people alone which hindereth them;
   but the Lord doth bind them with his bonds, though they be ignorant
   thereof. Luke commendeth unto us the providence of God in preserving
   his children; and though it be hidden from the wicked, yet we may
   behold the same with the eyes of faith, Furthermore, the wonderful
   counsel of God doth show itself here, in that the glory of Christ is
   furthered by those which are his most deadly enemies. For whereas the
   priests do assemble themselves together, it is not done without great
   rumor. All men wait for some rare and singular event; the apostles
   depart, being let loose and acquitted. Therefore, the adversaries are
   not only vanquished, but they confirm the gospel against their will.
   Notwithstanding, it is expedient for us to mark again, that the
   faithful do so get the victory, that they are always humbled under the
   cross. For they are threatened again, and straitly charged, that they
   teach not henceforth in the name of Christ. Therefore, they do not so
   get the upper hand that they do not triumph, save only under the
   reproach of the cross. Whereas Luke saith that they did all glorified
   God, he noteth the fruit of the miracle now the second time, although
   it may be that they were not all brought unto the perfect end. For that
   man which is touched with the feeling of the power of God, and doth not
   come unto Christ, neither hath his faith confirmed by the miracle he
   stayeth, as it were, in the midway. Yet this was some thing, though not
   all, that the power of God was acknowledged in the healing of the man,
   so that the adversaries being ashamed, did cease off from their fury,
   or at least give back a little.

   23. Furthermore when they were let go. It shall appear by and by to
   what end they declared to the other disciples what things had befallen
   them, to wit, that they might be the more emboldened and encouraged by
   the grace of God hereafter; secondly, that they might arm themselves
   with prayer against the furious threatenings of their enemies; and thus
   must the children of God do, one must prick forward another, and they
   must join hand in hand, that they may vanquish the common adversary
   fighting under Christ's banner. They consider [219] with themselves
   what dangers hang over their heads, to the end they may be the more
   ready to enter [220] the same, although they see their enemies press
   sore upon them; yet lest it should grieve them [221] to have a new
   combat ever now and then, they assure [222] themselves that they shall
   be invincible [223] through the same power of God whereby they got the
   victory before. And it is to be thought (although Luke makes no mention
   thereof) that the apostles being contented with their former answer,
   did not contend with those furies, [furious men;] and yet we must
   persuade ourselves that they were not so forgetful of their former
   constancy that they did submit themselves unto their ungodly decree
   like slaves. [224]

   Acts 4:24-31

   24. And when they had heard it, they lifted up their voice unto God
   with one accord, and said, Lord,, thou art God, which hast made heaven
   and earth, the sea, and all things which are therein; 25. Which by the
   mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why have the heathen raged
   together, and why have the people imagined vain things? 26. The kings
   of the earth have stood up, and the rulers have met together against
   the Lord, and against his Christ. 27. For of a truth, Herod and Pontius
   Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, have come together
   in this city against thy holy Son, Jesus, 28. That they might do
   whatsoever thine hand and thy counsel had decreed before to be done.
   29. And now, O Lord, look upon the threatenings of these men; and grant
   unto thy servants that they may speak thy word with boldness; 30.
   Reaching out thine hand to this end, that healing, and signs, and
   wonders, may be done by the name of thy only Son, Jesus. 31. And when
   they had prayed, the place moved wherein they were assembled: and they
   were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and did speak the word of God with
   boldness.


   We are taught by this example what is our duty to do when our
   adversaries do imperiously threaten us; for we must not carelessly
   laugh in time of danger, but the fear of danger ought to drive us to
   crave help at the hands of God, and this is a remedy to comfort and set
   us up on foot, lest, being terrified with threatenings, we cease off
   from doing our duty. Here is a double fruit of this history, that the
   disciples of Christ do not jest when they hear that their enemies do
   threaten them so sore and press so sore upon them, as careless and
   sluggish men use to do; but being touched with fear, they fly to seek
   help at the hands of God; and again, they are not terrified, neither
   yet do they conceive any immoderate fear; [225] but crave of God [226]
   invincible constancy with right godly petitions.

   24. Thou art God, which hast created. Although this title and
   commendation of God's power be general, yet it ought to be referred
   unto the present matter, for they do in such sort acknowledge the power
   of God in the creation of the whole world, that they apply the same
   therewithal unto the present use. In like sort, the prophets do
   oftentimes commend the same, to the end they may redress that fear
   which troubleth us when we behold the power of our enemies; secondly,
   they add thereunto the promise, and they make these two foundations of
   their boldness whereby they are emboldened to pray. And surely our
   prayers are such as they ought to be, and acceptable to God only then,
   when as staying ourselves upon his promises and power, we pray with
   certain hope to obtain that for which we pray, for we cannot otherwise
   have any true confidence unless God do will us to come unto him, and
   promise that he is ready to help us; and, secondly, unless we
   acknowledge that he is able enough to help us; wherefore let the
   faithful exercise themselves in this double meditation so often as they
   address themselves unto prayer. Furthermore, we gather hereby after
   what sort we ought to consider the creation of the world; to wit, that
   we may know that all things are subject to God, and ruled by his will,
   and when that the world hath done what it can, there shall no other
   thing come to pass but that which God hath decreed; yea, that the
   wantonness of the wicked is monstrous, as if the clay should resist the
   potter; for this is the meaning of the faithful generally, that
   whatsoever dangers hang over their heads, yet can God prevent the same
   infinite ways, forasmuch as all things are in his hand, and that he is
   able to make all the parts of heaven and earth (which he hath created)
   to obey him.

   25. Who by the mouth of David. They descend now into the second member,
   that they ask nothing but that which God hath promised to perform, so
   that his will and power are joined together, to the end they may fully
   assure themselves that they shall obtain their requests; and because
   the kingdom of Christ is now in hand, they make rehearsal of the
   promise of God, wherein he promiseth to defend and maintain the same,
   so that when the whole world hath done what it can to overthrow it, yet
   all shall be in vain; and herein their godliness and sincere zeal, in
   that they are not so much careful for their own safety, as for the
   increasing and advancement of the kingdom of Christ.

   Why have the Gentiles raged? We must need confess that David speaketh
   of himself, who after he was chosen king by the Lord, and anointed by
   Samuel the prophet, did enjoy the kingdom very hardly, [227] because
   his enemies withstood him on every side. We know how the rulers and
   people conspired together with Saul and his family; after that the
   Philistines, and other strange enemies, despising him when he came
   newly to the crown, made war against him, striving who should begin
   first, wherefore it is not without cause that he complaineth that the
   kings rage and take counsel together, and that the people do go about
   divers things; nevertheless, because he knew that God was the supporter
   of his kingdom, he derideth their foolish enterprises, and affirmeth
   that they are vain; but because his kingdom was established, that it
   might be a figure or image of the kingdom of Christ, David doth not
   stay still in the shadow itself; but he apprehendeth the body, yea, the
   Holy Ghost, as the apostles do truly repeat the same, doth sharply
   reprove the foolish and ridiculous madness of the world, in that they
   dare invade the kingdom of Christ which God had esta-blished, as well
   in the person of David as of Christ himself. And this is a singular
   comfort, in that we hear that God is on our side, so long as we go on
   warfare under the kingdom of Christ. Hereby we may persuade ourselves,
   that howsoever all men, both high and low do wickedly conspire together
   against this kingdom, yet shall they not prevail, for what is all the
   whole world compared with God? But we must first of all know and assure
   ourselves of this, that God will continually maintain the kingdom of
   his Son, whereof he himself is the author, so that we may set his
   decree (which shall not be broken) against the rashness of men, that
   trusting to the help of his hand, we may not doubt to despise all the
   preparation and furniture of men, though they be terrible; and he doth
   diligently express how great the bands of the adversaries are; he
   saith, that they attempt all things, he doth also reckon up their
   counsels, lest any of these do terrify us. Furthermore, when as the
   Psalm teacheth, that the kingdom of Christ shall endure, maugre the
   heads of the adversaries, it doth also show that there shall be many
   adversaries, which shall endeavor to overthrow the same. On the one
   side, he bringeth in the kings raging, on the other, the people all out
   of quiet, [228] whereby he signifieth that all estates shall be
   offended at it; [229] and no marvel, because nothing is more contrary
   to the flesh than the spiritual sword of the gospel wherewith Christ
   killeth us, that he may make us obey him, (Romans 15:16.) Therefore, we
   must know this for a surety, that the kingdom of Christ shall never be
   quiet in the world, lest when we are to fight, we be afraid as at some
   strange thing.

   26. Against the Lord, and his Christ. The Spirit teacheth by this word,
   that all those do make war against God which refuse to submit
   themselves to Christ; they do full little think this oftentimes,
   notwithstanding it is so that because God will reign in the person of
   his Son alone, we refuse to obey him so often as we rebel against
   Christ, as the Lord himself saith in John, "He which honoreth not the
   Son, honoreth not the Father." Wherefore let the hypocrites profess a
   thousand times that they mean nothing less than to make war against
   God, yet shall they find this true, that God is their open enemy,
   unless they embrace Christ with his gospel. The use of this doctrine is
   double, for it armeth us against all the terrors of the flesh, because
   we must not fear, lest they get the victory of God which withstand the
   gospel. Again, we must beware, lest, through the contempt of godly
   doctrine, we advance ourselves against God to our own destruction.

   27 Have met together in this city. They declare that this prophecy was
   proved to be true by the event, to the end they may believe the same
   more assuredly, for the sense is, Lord, thou hast spoken it and we have
   in truth tried [experienced] the same to be true; and they call to mind
   that which was done four years before, or thereabout. In like sort, it
   is expedient for us to apply the events of things which are foretold to
   the confirmation of our faith; but because it might seem that the
   matter fell out far otherwise then than the Psalm pronounceth,
   forasmuch as they raged not in vain, neither were the assaults of the
   enemies frustrate when they had put Christ to death; and their violence
   went further afterwards after a fearful manner. The faithful remove
   this offense, and say that the enemies could do no more than God had
   appointed; therefore, howsoever the wicked did suppose that Christ was
   quite taken away by death, and did now vainly triumph, yet the faithful
   confess that their rage was all but vain. But here may a question be
   moved, why he calleth them the Gentiles and people of Israel, seeing
   there was but one body? I think that the diversity of countries is
   noted in this place, out of which the Jews came together to the feast,
   as if they should have said, that the Jews which were born in divers
   places, having made, as it were, a concourse, did assault the kingdom
   of Christ, yet was their fury frustrate and of none effect.

   Thy holy Son Jesus. The Grecians use the very same word which I
   translated even now, servant, when mention was made of David, for they
   call [paida] sometimes a servant sometimes a son; and David is so
   called, because he was the minister of God, as well in ruling the
   people as in the office of a prophet; but this word, son, agreeth
   better with the person of Christ, unless some man had liefer take it
   thus, that Luke meant to allude unto that likelihood [resemblance]
   which David had with Christ when he setteth down a word of a double
   signification. It is expressly said, that God hath anointed his Son,
   that that may truly agree to him which is in the Psalm, for in
   anointing him God made him a King, and yet we must note therewithal
   what anointing this was, for we know that he was not anointed with
   visible oil, but with the Holy Ghost.

   28. That they might do. I have already declared to what end this is
   spoken; that the kingdom of Christ was so far from being overrun by
   that conspiracy, that in truth it did then flourish. Notwithstanding
   herein is contained a singular doctrine, that God doth so govern and
   guide all things by his secret counsel, that, he doth bring to pass
   those things which he hath determined, even by the wicked. Not that
   they are ready willingly to do him such service, but because he turneth
   their counsels and attempts backward; so that on the one side appeareth
   great equity and most great righteousness; on the other appeareth
   nought but wickedness and iniquity. Which matter we have handled more
   at large in the second chapter. Let us learn here, by the way, that we
   must so consider the providence of God, that we know that it is the
   chief and only guider of all things which are done in the world, that
   the devil and all the wicked are kept back with God's bridle, lest they
   should do us any harm; that when they rage fastest, yet are they not at
   liberty to do what they list, but have the bridle given them, yet so
   far forth as is expedient to exercise us. Those men which do
   acknowledge the foreknowledge of God alone, and yet confess not that
   all things are done as it pleaseth him, are easily convict by these
   words, That God hath appointed before that thing to be done which was
   done. Yea, Luke being not contented with the word counsel, addeth also
   hand, improperly, yet to the end he might the more plainly declare that
   the events of things are not only governed by the counsel of God, but
   that they are also ordered by his power and hand.

   29. And now O Lord. They do very well extend that unto themselves which
   they cited concerning Christ; because he will not, be separated from
   the gospel; yea, what trouble so ever befalleth his members, he
   applieth that to his own person. And they crave at God's hands that he
   will beat down the cruelty of the adversaries; yet not so much for
   their own sake that they may live quietly and without vexation, as that
   they may have liberty to preach the gospel in all places. Neither was
   it for them to desire a life which they might spend idly, having
   forsaken their calling. For they add, "Grant unto thy servants, O Lord,
   that they may speak boldly." And by the way we must note this speech,
   that the Lord would behold their threatenings. For seeing it belongeth
   properly to him to resist the proud, and to throw down their lofty
   looks; the more proudly they brag and boast, the more do they
   undoubtedly provoke God to be displeased with them, and it is not to be
   doubted but that God, being offended with such indignity and cruelty,
   will redress the same. So Ezechias, to the end he may obtain help in
   extremity, declareth before the Lord the arrogancy of Sennacherib and
   his cruel threatenings, (Isaiah 37:14 and 17.) Wherefore let the
   cruelty and reproaches of our enemies rather stir up in us a desire to
   pray, than any whit discourage us from going forward in the course of
   our office.

   30. Grant unto thy servants. Seeing that one miracle had stinged the
   enemy so sore how is it that these holy men do desire to have new
   miracles done daily? Therefore we gather that hence which I have
   already touched, that they make so great account of the glory of God,
   that in comparison of this, they set light by all other things. They
   have respect unto this one thing only, that the power of God may be
   declared by miracles, which the godly ought always to desire, although
   the adversaries burst, and all the whole hell do rage. The same must we
   also think of boldness to speak. They knew that the wicked could abide
   nothing worse than the free course of the gospel; but because they know
   that that is the doctrine of life which God will have published
   whatsoever befall; they do undoubtedly prefer the preaching thereof
   before all other things, because it is acceptable to God. And we are
   taught that we do then rightly acknowledge the benefits of God as we
   ought, if by this occasion we be pricked forward to pray, that he will
   confirm that which he hath began. The apostles had showed a token of
   heroic fortitude; now again they pray that they may be furnished with
   boldness. So Paul desireth the faithful to pray unto the Lord that his
   mouth may be opened, whereas, notwithstanding, his voice did sound
   everywhere (Ephesians 6:19.) Therefore, the more we perceive ourselves
   to be holpen by the Lord, let us learn to crave at the hands of God
   that we may go forward hereafter; and especially seeing the free
   confession of the gospel is a singular gift of God, we must continually
   beseech him to keep us in the same.

   31. And when they had prayed. Luke declareth now that God did not only
   hear this prayer, but did also testify the same by a visible sign from
   heaven. For the shaking of the place should, of itself, have done them
   small good; but it tendeth to another end, that the faithful may know
   that God is present with them. Finally, it is nothing else but a token
   of the presence of God. But the fruit followeth, for they are all
   filled with the Holy Ghost, and endowed with greater boldness. We ought
   rather to stand upon this second member. For whereas God did declare
   his power then by shaking the place it was a rare and extraordinary
   thing; and whereas it appeared by the effect, that the apostles did
   obtain that which they desired, this is a perpetual profit of prayer,
   which is also set before us for an example.

   Acts 4:32-37

   32. And the multitude which believed had one heart and one soul; and no
   man did say that any of those things which he possessed was his own;
   but they had all things common. 33. And the apostles did bear witness
   of the resurrection of Jesus Christ with great power; and great grace
   was upon them all. 34. For there was one among them that kicked: for so
   many as possessed lands or houses, setting them, they brought the price
   of those things which were sold, 35. And they laid it at the feet of
   the apostles: and it was distributed to every man according as he had
   need. 36. And Joses, which was suremined of the opostles Barnabas,
   (which is, the son of comfort,) a Levite, of the country of Cyprus, 37.
   Whereas he had land, he sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at
   the apostles' feet.


   32. And the multitude. In this place there are three things commended;
   that the faithful were all of one mind; that there was a mutual
   partaking of goods amongst them; that the apostles behaved themselves
   stoutly in announcing the resurrection of Christ. He saith that the
   multitude had one heart; because this is far more excellent than if a
   few men should have a mutual consent. And heretofore he hath declared,
   that the Church did grow to be about five thousand. And now he saith
   that there was wonderful concord in so great a multitude, which is a
   very hard matter.

   And surely where faith beareth the chief sway, it doth so knit the
   hearts of men together, that all of them do both will and nill one
   thing. For discord springeth hence because we are not all governed with
   the same Spirit of Christ. It is well known that by these two words,
   heart and soul, he meaneth the will. And because the wicked do
   oftentimes conspire together to do evil, this concord was laudable and
   holy therefore because it was amongst the faithful.

   And no man did say. This is the second member; that they coupled this
   love with external benefits. But we shall see anon, after what sort
   they had their goods common. This is now worth the noting in the text
   of Luke that the inward unity of minds goeth before as the root, and
   then the fruit followeth after. And surely even we ought to observe the
   same order, we must love one another, [230] and then this love of ours
   must show itself by external effects. [231] And in vain do we boast of
   a right affection, unless there appear some testimony thereof in
   external offices. Moreover, Luke declareth therewithal, that they were
   not of one mind for any respect of their own commodity, forasmuch as
   the rich men, when they did liberally bestow their goods, sought
   nothing less than their own gain.

   33. And with great power. This third member appertaineth to doctrine.
   For Luke doth signify that the zeal which the apostles had to preach
   the gospel was so far from being diminished, that they were rather
   endowed with new power. Whereas he doth only name the resurrection of
   Christ, it is synecdoche; for this part is put for the whole gospel.
   But Luke maketh mention of the resurrection alone, because it is, as it
   were, the furnishing or fulfilling of the gospel; and, secondly,
   because they had endured a sore combat for the same, and the Sadducees
   were sore grieved at it, who aid then bear the chief swinge, [sway.]

   And great grace was He signifieth that this served not a little to the
   spreading abroad of doctrine, in that, by helping the poor so
   bountifully, they found favor at the hands of strangers. For he saith
   that they were beloved, because they were beneficial. [232] Therefore,
   there is a showing of a reason in these words, No man amongst them did
   lack. Although we need not doubt of this, but that their honesty, and
   temperance, and modesty, and patience, and other virtues, did provoke
   many to bear them good-will. He declareth [233] afterward, after what
   sort they had their goods common, which he had touched before, to wit,
   that the rich men sold their lands and houses, that they might relieve
   the poverty of the poor,

   34. For so many as were. Although this be an universal speech, yet is
   it all one as if it were indefinite. And assuredly it is to be thought
   that there were many which did not diminish their possessions, and that
   may be gathered out of the text, [context.] For when he speaketh of
   Joses anon, undoubtedly he meant to note a notable example, passing all
   others. Therefore he saith, that all did that which many did every
   where; neither doth this disagree with the common use of the Scripture.
   Again, he meaneth not that the faithful sold all that they had, but
   only so much as need required. For this is spoken for amplification's
   sake, that the rich men did not only relieve the poverty of their
   brethren of the yearly revenue of their lands, but they were so
   liberal, that they spared not their lands. And this might be, though
   they did not rob themselves of all, but only a little diminish their
   revenues; which we may gather again out of the words of Luke, for he
   saith that this was the end, that no man might lack. He showeth
   further, that they used great wisdom, [234] because it was distributed
   as every man had need. Therefore the goods were not equally divided,
   but there was a discreet distribution made, lest any should be out of
   measure oppressed with poverty. And, peradventure, Joses hath this
   commendation given him by name, because he sold his only possession.
   For by this means he passed all the rest.

   Hereby it appeareth what that meaneth, that no man counted anything his
   own, but they had all things common. For no man had his own privately
   to himself, that he alone might enjoy the same, neglecting others; but
   as need required, they were ready to bestow upon all men. And now we
   must needs have more than iron bowels, seeing that we are no more moved
   with the reading of this history. The faithful did at that day give
   abundantly even of that which was their own, but we are not only
   content at this day wickedly to suppress that which we have in our
   hands, but do also rob others. They did and faithfully bring forth
   their own; we invent a thousand subtile shifts to draw all things unto
   us by hook or by crook. They laid it down at the apostles' feet, we
   fear not with sacrilegious boldness to convert that to our own use
   which was offered to God. They sold in times past their possessions,
   there reigneth at this day an insatiable desire to buy. Love made that
   common to the poor and needy which was proper to every man; such is the
   unnaturalness of some men now, that they cannot abide that the poor
   should dwell upon the earth, that they should have the use of water,
   air, and heaven. [235]

   Wherefore, these things are written for our shame and reproach.
   Although even the poor themselves are to blame for some part of this
   evil. For seeing goods cannot be common after this sort, save only
   where there is a godly agreement, and where there reigneth one heart
   and one soul; many men are either so proud or unthankful, or slothful,
   or greedy, or such hypocrites, that they do not only so much as in them
   lieth quite put out the desire to do well, but also hinder ability. And
   yet must we remember that admonition of Paul, that we be not weary of
   well-doing, (Galatians 6:9.) And whereas, under color of this, the
   Anabaptists and fantastical [fanatical] men have made much ado, as if
   there ought to be no civil property of goods amongst Christians, I have
   already refuted this folly [236] of theirs in the second chapter. For
   neither doth Luke in this place prescribe a law to all men which they
   must of necessity follow, while that he reckoneth up what they did in
   whom a certain singular efficacy and power of the Holy Spirit of God
   did show itself; neither doth he speak generally of all men, that it
   can be gathered that they were not counted Christians which did not
   sell all that they had.

   Acts 5:1-6

   1. And a certain man called Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
   possession, 2. And he kept back part of the price, his wife knowing
   thereof, and bringing part, he laid it at the apostles' feet. 3. And
   Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart that thou
   shouldest lie to the Holy Ghost, and keep back part of the price of the
   ground? 4. Did it not, remaining, remain to thee? and, being sold, was
   it not in thy power? How is it that thou hast put this thing in thy
   heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God. 5. And when Ananias heard
   these words, falling, he yielded up the ghost; and there came great
   fear upon all those which had heard these things. 6. Furthermore, the
   young men which were present gathered him up, and, carrying him out,
   they buried him.


   1. Those things which Luke hath reported hitherto did show that that
   company, which was gathered together under the name of Christ, was
   rather a company of angels than of men, Moreover, that was incredible
   virtue, that the rich men did despoil themselves of their own accord,
   not only of their money, but also of their land, that they might
   relieve the poor. But now he showeth that Satan had invented a shift to
   get into that holy company, and that under color of such excellent
   virtue; for he hath wonderful wiles of hypocrisy to insinuate himself.
   This way doth Satan assault the Church, when as he cannot prevail by
   open war. But we must specially in this place have respect unto the
   drift of the Holy Ghost. For in this history he meant to declare,
   first, how acceptable singleness of heart is to God, and what an
   abomination hypocrisy is in his sight; secondly, how greatly he
   alloweth [approves] the holy and pure policy and government of his
   Church. For this is the principal point, the punishment wherewith
   punished Ananias and his wife. As the greatness thereof did at that
   time terrify them all, so it is unto us a testimony that God cannot
   abide this unfaithfulness, when as bearing a show of holiness where
   there is none, we do mock him contemptibly. For if, having weighed all
   the circumstances, we be desirous to know the sum, Luke condemneth no
   other fault in Ananias than this, that he meant to deceive God and the
   Church with a reigned offering. Yet there were more evils packed under
   this dissimulation: the contempt of God, whom he feareth not, though he
   knew his wickedness; sacrilegious defrauding, because he keepeth back
   part of that which he professeth to be holy to God; perverse vanity and
   ambition, because he vaunteth himself in the presence of men, without
   having any respect unto God's judgment; want of faith, because he would
   never have gone this way to work, unless he had mistrusted God; the
   corrupting of a godly and holy order; furthermore, the hypocrisy itself
   was a great offense of itself. [237] The fact of Ananias did bear a
   goodly show, [238] although he had given only the half of his land.
   Neither is this a small virtue, for a rich man to bestow the half of
   his goods upon the poor; but the sacrifices of the ungodly are an
   abomination to God, (Proverbs 15:8;) neither can any thing please him
   where the singleness of heart is wanting. For this cause is it that
   Christ maketh more account of the two mites offered by the widow, than
   of the great sums of others, who of their great heaps gave some part,
   (Luke 21:2.) This is the cause why God doth show an example of such
   sharp punishment in Ananias. Now, let us note every point by itself. He
   laid it at the feet of the apostles. Lo, what ambition doth! Ananias is
   ashamed not to be accounted one of the best; therefore, although he be
   greedy of money, yet to the end he may purchase a name amongst men, he
   depriveth himself of some part of his riches. In the meanwhile, he doth
   not consider that he lieth and deceiveth in the sight of God, and that
   God will punish this lie. So it is, that he honoreth the apostles' feet
   more than God's eyes. Wherefore, we must take good heed, that when we
   do well, we do not seek to be praised of the bystanders; [239] and it
   is not without cause that Christ saith, that it is profitable for us
   when we give our alms, to have the left hand ignorant of that which the
   right hand doth.

   3. And Peter said. How did Peter know Ananias' fraud (and purloining?)
   Undoubtedly by the revelation of the Spirit. Therefore, Luke signifieth
   unto us, that the apostles did after a sort represent God's person, and
   supply his room. If the Spirit of God, by the mouth of a mortal man, do
   so sore urge an hypocrite, being otherwise painted with the beautiful
   color of virtues, how shall the reprobate abide the voice of God
   himself, with the sound of the trumpet, when they shall appear before
   his judgment-seat? Furthermore, Peter pointeth out the cruelness and
   horribleness of the offense [240] by his question, when he saith, that
   Satan had filled the heart of Ananias. For there is no man whose heart
   is not pricked with the pricks of Satan, and all men are also many ways
   tempted, yea, these temptations pierce into their minds; but where
   Satan possesseth the heart, he reigneth in the whole man, having, as it
   were, expelled God. This is a sign of a reprobate, to be so addicted
   and given over to Satan, that the Spirit of God hath no place. That
   which followeth afterward concerning lying may have a double sense;
   either that he did falsely bear a show of the Spirit, or that he lied
   against the Spirit. And, indeed, it is word for word mentiri Spiritum;
   but forasmuch as the Greek word [pseudesthai] is joined with a double
   accusative case and that doth better agree with the text [context,] I
   am rather of this mind, that Ananias is reprehended, because he did lie
   falsely to the Holy Ghost. Which he confirmeth shortly after, when he
   upbraideth this unto him, that he hath lied unto God, and not unto men.
   Wherefore we must take great heed, that hypocrisy reign not in us,
   which hath this wickedness proper to it, to go about to deceive God,
   and, as it were cornicum oculos configere. To go about to make blind
   those which are most wise; [241] which cannot be without a disloyal and
   unseemly mock. Wherefore it is not without cause that Peter saith, that
   where this cometh to pass the heart is possessed of Satan. For who
   durst (unless he were void of reason) so blaspheme God? Therefore Peter
   asketh him as of some wonder, because such blindness is horrible.

   4. Did it not remaining. This amplifieth the offense because he sinned,
   being enforced by no necessity. For seeing it is no just or lawful
   excuse to have been provoked by some other means, how much worse is it
   to run headlong unto wickedness willingly, and, as it were of set
   purpose to pull down God's vengeance? We gather out of this, that no
   man was enforced to sell his goods or lands. For Peter saith, that
   Ananias had free liberty to keep both his land and his money; because
   in the second member, the field which was sold is taken for the price
   itself. Therefore he should nevertheless have been counted faithful,
   though he had kept that which was his own. Whereby it appeareth that
   they are men destitute of their right wits, who say that it is not
   lawful for the faithful to have anything of their own.

   Thou hast not lied to men, but to God. Although the words be diversely
   construed, yet do I not doubt but that this confirmeth the former
   sentence. For hypocrites do so enwrap themselves in so many shifts,
   that they think they have nothing to do with God. And Peter speaketh
   thus expressly, because Ananias had deceived the Church. But he ought
   to have considered, that

   "where two or three be gathered together in the name of Christ, he is
   present there as the chief governor,"
   (Matthew 18:20;)

   yea, he ought to have behaved himself no otherwise in that assembly,
   than if he should have seen God with his eyes. For seeing that God will
   reign in the Church, if we give him any reverence, we must reverence
   that rule and government religiously which he exerciseth by his Word.
   The apostles were indeed men, but not private men, because God had put
   them in his stead. Furthermore, we must note, that he saith that he
   lieth to God who doth lie to the Holy Ghost. For the divinity of the
   Holy Ghost is manifestly proved by this form of speech. In like sort
   Paul saith, "Ye are the temples of God, because his Spirit dwelleth in
   you," (1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; and 6:19.)

   5. When Ananias heard these things. The death of Ananias doth, indeed,
   declare and prove the force of the word, which Paul cloth highly extol;
   to wit, that it is the savor of death unto death to those which perish,
   (2 Corinthians 2:16.) He speaketh, indeed, of the spiritual death of
   the soul, but there was a visible sign in the body of Ananias of that
   punishment which cannot be seen with the eyes of men. He was not slain
   with sword, by force, nor hand, but was stricken dead with the only
   hearing of the voice. When we hear this, let the threatenings of the
   gospel terrify us, and humble us in time, lest we also feel the like
   effect. For that which is spoken of Christ,

   "He shall slay the wicked with the breath of his mouth."
   (Isaiah 11:4,)

   doth not only appertain to the head of the wicked, but also to every
   member. For those which refuse the salvation offered in his word, it
   must needs be deadly to them, which was naturally wholesome. But and if
   any man do think it an absurd thing that the apostle did punish Ananias
   bodily, first, I answer, that this was an extraordinary thing;
   secondly, that this was one of the gifts of the Spirit, as it appeareth
   by the 19th chapter of the First to the Corinthians, (verse 10.) After
   which sort we shall afterward see Elymas, the sorcerer, stricken with
   blindness by Paul, (Acts 13:8.) Therefore, Peter did nothing which was
   impertinent to his function, when he did in time shoot that dart which
   the Holy Ghost had given him. And whereas some think that this was too
   cruel a punishment, this cometh to pass, because, weighing Ananias' sin
   in their own and not in God's balance, they count that but a light
   offense which was a most great and grievous crime, being full of such
   heinous offenses as I have already declared. Other some do think that
   this was nothing so, because they see many hypocrites escape scot free
   daily, which do no less mock God than did Ananias; yea, because they
   themselves being most gross contemners of God, are yet notwithstanding
   unpunished for their wickedness. But as God hath poured out visible
   graces upon his Church in the beginning, to the end we may know that he
   will be present with us by the secret power of his Spirit, yea, he
   showed that openly by external signs, which we feel inwardly by the
   experiment of faith; so he declared by the visible punishment of two,
   how horrible a judgment remaineth for all hypocrites, which shall mock
   God and his Church.

   And there came great fear This was the Lord's purpose, by punishing one
   to make the rest afraid, that they might reverently beware of all
   hypocrisy. And that which Luke saith, that they feared, doth appertain
   unto us also. For God meant to give all ages a lesson at that time,
   that they may learn to deal sincerely and uprightly with him. In the
   mean season, the punishment of this wicked person ought to have
   encouraged the godly hereafter to consecrate their goods more freely to
   God and the poor; because they might gather how precious alms was in
   the sight of God, seeing the profaning thereof was so punished. [242]

   Acts 5:7-11

   7. And there was passed about the space of three hours, when his wife
   came in, ignorant of that which was done. 8. And Peter said unto her,
   Tell me, sold ye the field for so much? She answered, Surely, for so
   much. 9. And Peter said unto her, What is this that ye are agreed
   together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those
   which have buried thy husband are at the door, which shall carry thee
   out. 10. And immediately she fell down at his feet, and gave up the
   ghost. Furthermore, when the young men came in, they found her dead,
   and when they had carried her out, they buried her beside her husband.
   11. And there came great fear upon all the church, and upon all which
   heard these things.


   7. That punishment wherewith the Lord punished Sapphira containeth no
   new thing, save only that the example was the more confirmed thereby.
   And it came to pass by the certain providence of God, that the Church
   should see apart the obstinate wickedness and treacherous mind of them
   both. Seeing their faults were alike, they might have been known
   together; but this was more fit and profitable for the Church, that
   they might severally bewray their own wickedness. Neither was Sapphira
   provoked by the sight of her husband to dissemble, (as it falleth out
   oftentimes,) that the fault could be ascribed to shamefacedness, but of
   her own accord, and being pricked forward by no other means, she
   seemeth to be no better than her husband. Moreover, their wickedness in
   lying was like, forasmuch as she may see by Peter's interrogation that
   their guile was found out.

   8. Tell me. We see that God doth not by and by [243] punish her, but
   first he trieth the matter thoroughly, lest he should send vengeance
   upon any save the obstinate, and those which will not be pardoned.
   [244] For although Sapphira did know that the matter was hidden, she
   ought to have been stricken with this question of Peter, no otherwise
   than if she had been cited to appear before the judgment-seat of God.
   She hath a time granted her to repent; yea, this is, as it were, a
   pleasant [245] inviting unto repentance. But she, in holding on so
   carelessly, [246] doth declare that she was incurable, because she is
   touched with no fear of God.

   And hereby are we taught to labor diligently to bring sinners into the
   way. For the Spirit of God keepeth this moderation; but when as
   stubbornness and the stubborn contempt of God is added unto the
   offense, it is now high time to punish. Therefore, those men are too
   arrogant who are displeased with the immoderate rigor of God. It is
   rather our duty to consider how we shall in time to come [247] stand
   before the judgment-seat of God; although this is too much to despise
   his holy power and majesty, if we will have him mocked freely without
   any punishment. Moreover, so many circumstances, which before I have
   gathered, do sufficiently prove that Ananias and Sapphira were not
   worthy of one death only. For, first of all, hypocrisy is of itself
   very abominable to God. Secondly, whereas they are determined to lie
   unto God, this ariseth of great contempt, in that they do not reverence
   and fear Christ, being the Chief Governor of those amongst whom they
   were. It is ungodliness joined with impudency; because, so they can
   escape shame and reproach amongst men, before whom they were determined
   to vaunt and brag, they pass not to deny their manifest wickedness unto
   God. Whereas they do stubbornly deny their offense, this doth, as it
   were, make up the heap and measure. And whereas innumerable hypocrites
   do no less mock God and the Church daily, who, notwithstanding, are not
   punished with death, I have already showed why this ought to seem to be
   no inconvenient thing. [248] Forasmuch as God is the only Judge of the
   world, it belongeth to him to punish every man at his pleasure, when
   and how it seemeth good to him. Wherefore we must not prescribe unto
   him a certain mean and manner of punishment. But the greatness of the
   spiritual judgment, which is as yet hid, hath been set before us in the
   bodily punishment of two, as in a mirror. For if we consider what it is
   to be cast into eternal fire, we shall not judge that this is the
   greatest evil and punishment of all, to fall down dead before men. Look
   the 10th chapter of the First to the Corinthians, verse 5.

   9. To tempt the Spirit. He uttereth the same thing in other words which
   he had said before; to wit, that they did mock God unreverently and
   contemptibly. But he said that they tempted the Spirit, because they
   had cunningly packed their fraud, as if the Spirit of God were not the
   knower of the hearts. For it was a point of too great carelessness,
   seeing the one made the other privy to their wickedness, to make their
   match between themselves, having, as it were, excluded God. For the
   Scripture saith, that God is tempted either when his power is taken
   from him, or the knowledge of all things is denied him. Furthermore, he
   meaneth that Spirit which governed the Church by the apostles. For when
   Christ saith, When the Spirit cometh, he shall judge the world, he
   noteth no other kind of authority than that which he exerciseth by the
   ministry of the Church.

   11. And there came fear. He saith, again, that the punishment of one
   was a lesson to all. But he plainly expresseth in this place a double
   fear. He saith that the Church feared, because the faithful do never so
   perfectly fear God, but that they profit yet more, being admonished by
   his judgments. Therefore, by all those punishments which we read have
   been laid upon men in times past, and do daily see to be laid upon
   them, doth God call us back from the enticements and liberty of
   sinning. For our flesh must be bridled every now and then after this
   sort, because one bridle will scarce serve the turn. There was another
   manner [of] fear in the strangers, yet no such fear as brought them
   unto the sincere worship of God; yet, notwithstanding, it was such as
   caused them to give the glory to God.

   Acts 5:12-16

   12. And by the hands of the apostles were done many signs and wonders
   amongst the people. And they were all with one accord in the Porch of
   Solomon. 13. And of the other durst no man join himself to them: but
   the people magnified them. 14. And the multitude of those that believed
   in the Lord, both of men and women, grew more and more. 15. So that
   they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them in beds and
   couches, that at the least way the shadow of Peter, as he came, might
   shadow some of them. 16. And a multitude of the next cities came
   together to Jerusalem, bringing their sick, and those which were vexed
   with unclean spirits, which were all healed.


   12. He returneth to miracles of another sort, which are more proper to
   the gospel; to wit, whereby Christ doth not only declare his power, but
   also his goodness; to the end he may allure men unto himself with the
   sweetness of his grace. For he came to save the world, and not to
   condemn it. Therefore, whereas the sick are healed, and others are
   delivered from devils, these benefits done to the body do represent the
   spiritual grace of Christ; and therefore they agree with his natural
   [249] office that I may so speak. That fearful sign which was showed in
   Ananias and Sapphira came to pass extraordinarily [250] Luke saith that
   the Church was increased by miracles, because they serve for faith,
   [251] (as we have said,) to prepare some, to confirm others. Whereby
   that is proved again, which I have said elsewhere that miracles must
   never be separated from the word. Luke showeth the multitude of
   miracles by this, in that the sick were brought forth everywhere, that
   they might be healed. For God meant thus to set forth the gospel of his
   Son, especially at the beginning; that he, might for a certainty
   testify to the Jews, that that restoring of all things was present,
   which was so often promised, and in which all their hope was reposed,
   as they themselves did pretend, (and make semblance.) It is well known
   that couches were certain little beds in which the men of old were wont
   to rest at noon. Because they might the more easily carry them out,
   they laid the sick in them.

   And they were all with one accord. He signifieth unto us that they were
   wont to meet together at certain hours, not only for doctrine and
   prayers' sake, but that they might win others unto the Lord, as
   occasion was given. For every man lived at home at his own house, but
   they had their meetings there, as assuredly no body of the Church can
   otherwise continue. For if every man will be his own teacher, and pray
   apart by himself, and if there be no meetings and assemblies, how
   excellently soever the Church be ordered and appointed, yet must it
   needs decay and come to nought. He saith that they were all of one
   mind, to the end we may know that they did all keep that order
   willingly, that no man was so disordered as to keep himself at home,
   [252] neglecting the public assembly. Wherein they showed a token, not
   only of modesty, but also of constancy. For they could not do this
   without danger, seeing the place was so famous. For which cause, the
   agreement of them all to put themselves in hazard was so much the more
   worthy of commendation.

   13. And of other durst no man. This was the second fruit of the
   miracles, in that these which believed not, being convict with the
   excellent power of God, dare not despise the apostles, but are rather
   enforced to reverence the Church. Yet that might seem an absurd thing,
   that being terrified with miracles, they flee from God and his people.
   I answer, that they were letted through their own fault from coming;
   and it is not to be doubted but that God doth call us unto himself by
   miracles. Therefore, whosoever they be that go not so far, as willingly
   to embrace the grace of God which shineth in them, they are letted and
   hindered by their own perverse and evil conscience. Yet this is some
   fruit, in that God wringeth some fear out of them; although Luke doth
   ascribe this not only to the miracle, but rather comprehendeth all
   together which might serve to the increasing of the dignity of the
   Church. For all things were so ordered, that there shined there a
   certain divine majesty; for they did no less differ from the other than
   angels from men.

   For there is a certain secret majesty in holy discipline and in sincere
   godliness, which doth even fast bind the wicked whether they will or
   no. But we know not at this day of what sort the same is; yea, rather,
   we cause ourselves to be despised together with the gospel, through our
   profane liberty of evil living. Furthermore, the punishment of Ananias
   and his wife did not a little terrify the wicked, and keep them from
   breaking in unadvisedly into the company of those men, where God had
   showed himself so sharp a Judge. Yet we must note that he speaketh of
   men which were indifferent in this place, and of those which were not
   of the worst sort; for there were at that time many at Jerusalem, whom
   neither the reverence of signs, neither yet of the angelic holiness of
   the godly, could move. Therefore Luke meaneth moderate men, in whom
   there are some seed of the fear of God; like as we see at this day
   certain, whom the vanity of the world keepeth back from submitting
   their necks unto the yoke of Christ; yet because they smell out some
   divine thing in our doctrine, [253] they dare not despise the same; yet
   we may see also in what deadly grins [gins] Satan insnareth all those
   which have not the Spirit of Christ, that they do not only fear to
   provide for themselves, but purposely avoid those remedies which are
   offered them unto salvation. They both see and allow those things which
   are both holy and profitable, and yet, notwithstanding, they are either
   carried headlong unto things which are worse, or else they wax drowsy
   in their filthiness.

   15. The shadow of Peter, as he came. The Papists abuse this text, [as a
   pretexts] not only to the end they may commend reigned miracles, which
   they say are done at the graves of martyrs, but also that they may
   boast of their relics. Why (say they) shall not the grave, or garment,
   the touching of the bones of Peter, have power to heal, as well as his
   shadow had this power? I answer, we must not by and by think that that
   is right which Luke saith was done by ignorant men, and those which
   knew not the pure faith. Yet we have a more certain answer in readiness
   than this. For the apostles were endued with such power for this cause,
   because they were ministers of the gospel. Therefore they used this
   gift, inasmuch as it served to further the credit of the gospel; yea,
   God did no less show forth his power in their shadow than in their
   mouth. Those miracles whereof the Papists babble are so unlike to
   these, that they are rather altogether contrary. For this is the end of
   their miracles, to lead away the world from Christ unto saints.

   Acts 5:17-26

   17. And the high priest rose, and all that were with him, that is to
   say, the sect of the Sadducees, and were. filled with zeal, [or
   indignation.] 18. And they laid hands on the apostles, and put them in
   the common prison. 19. And the angel of the Lord opened the door of the
   prison in the night season, and bringing them out, said, 20. Go, and
   standing, speak in the temple unto the people all the word, of this
   life. 21. When they heard this early in the morning, they entered into
   the temple and taught. But when the high priest came, and those which
   were with him, they called a council, and all the whole senate of the
   children of Israel, and sent into the common prison to fetch them. 22.
   But when the ministers came, they found them not. Therefore they
   returned and told, saying, 23. The prison truly found we shut with all
   diligence, and the keepers standing at the door; but when the prison
   was opened, we found none within. 24. When the chief priest, and the
   captain of the temple, and the priests, heard these sayings, they
   doubted of these things, what this would be. 25. Furthermore, a certain
   man coming told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye had put in prison
   stand in the temple, teaching the people. 26. Then the captain going
   with the ministers, brought them without violence. For they feared the
   people, lest they should be stoned.


   17. Luke hath hitherto declared that the Church was wonderfully
   increased, that it was furnished [254] with divers gifts, that it
   excelled in miracles; finally, that the kingdom of Christ did flourish
   there by all means. Now he beginneth to show that the fury of the
   wicked was kindled with these things, so that they raged sorer afresh.
   [255] Whence we may gather with what blind fury and rage Satan driveth
   them forward, when as they are so little terrified with such evident
   power of God, that they run headlong more boldly, and with greater
   force, and bend all their force, as it were, to overthrow the very
   heaven. As this so great blindness is a horrible punishment of Almighty
   God, so ought it to teach all men to submit themselves betimes to God,
   lest that they themselves, being taken with the spirit of giddiness,
   (whilst they run against the hand of God,) be broken in pieces with the
   same. Nevertheless, let us know that God will so increase his Church
   with spiritual good things, that yet, notwithstanding, he suffereth the
   same to be vexed of the wicked. Therefore we must alway be ready for
   the combat; for our estate at this day is not unlike to theirs.
   Especially the knowledge of the gifts of God, whereby he testifieth
   that he is present with us, ought to encourage us, lest the fury and
   boldness of the wicked do terrify and dismay us. For this is no small
   comfort, when we know that God is present with us.

   Which were with him. He meaneth those which were most familiar, and the
   highest linked in friendship with the chief priest, whose counsel he
   was wont to use, and whom he had, being, as it were, gathered and
   culled out of the whole order, not for judgment, or discretion, but for
   the love of his faction; as they did then contend among themselves
   shamelessly, like mortal enemies. Furthermore, Luke saith again, that
   the Sadducees did bear the greatest swing at that day; to the end we
   may know that the government was then confused with horrible wasteness;
   [256] when as such a sect could bear rule. But God suffered the
   synagogue to be drowned in such extreme reproach, after that he had
   separated his Church from it, to the end they might have the less
   excuse, who despising the gospel, did continue in such a sink of
   filthiness. In the mean season, what did enforce and drive forward
   those swine, who were touched with no care of the life to come, save
   only mere ambition, and desire to keep that lordship and pre-eminence
   which they had gotten?

   They were filled with zeal. I had liefer keep the Greek word still
   (especially seeing it is common enough otherwise) than to translate it
   emulation (or indignation;) for he speaketh generally of the perverse
   and violent force wherewith hypocrites are carried and inflamed to
   maintain their superstitions; whereby it appeareth what account God
   maketh of zeal, and what praise it deserveth, when as it is not
   governed by reason and wisdom, that is, when it is not led and guided
   by the Spirit of God. We see at this day those men moved and stirred
   with devilish fury, who will be counted the most devout of all men, who
   rage horribly to shed innocent blood. Nevertheless, let us note that he
   speaketh not in this place of an unadvised or blind zeal, which was in
   many of the Jews, as Paul affirmeth, but we understand rather a hot and
   unbridled violence; for although the wicked be accused of their own
   consciences, because they wittingly resist godliness, yet do they
   deceive themselves with a false show of zeal, because it is lawful to
   prevent new things. [257] So at this day almost in all Popery they
   boast only of zeal, whereas notwithstanding they are zealous for their
   belly. But admit we grant that that is true which they pretend, how can
   this excuse the heat of their cruelty whereunto they are enforced by
   their blindness? as if this were a chief virtue to grant liberty to
   their wrath, [258] to be avenged of that which displeaseth them; but
   this was former in order, to make a difference between good and evil,
   lest any thing be dissolved [259] unadvisedly.

   19. The angel of the Lord. The Lord brought the apostles out of prison,
   not because he would rid them quite out of the hands of their enemies,
   for he suffered them afterwards to be brought back again, and to be
   beaten with rods; but he meant to declare, by this miracle, that they
   were in his hand and tuition, to the end he might maintain the credit
   of the gospel; partly that the Church might have another confirmation
   thereby, partly that the wicked might be left without excuse wherefore
   we must not hope always, nay, we must not always desire that God will
   deliver us from death; but we must be content with this one thing, that
   our life is defended by his hand, so far as is expedient. In that he
   useth the ministry of an angel, in this he doth according to his common
   custom; for he testifieth every where in the Scriptures, that the
   angels are ministers of his goodness towards us. Neither is that a vain
   speculation, for this is a profitable help for our infirmity, that we
   know that not only God doth care for us, but also that the heavenly
   spirits do watch for our safety. Again, this was no small pledge of
   God's love towards us, that the creatures of all other most noble are
   appointed to have regard of our safety. The angel openeth the prison in
   the night, because he would not work the miracle when the wicked might
   see him, although he would have the same being wrought known by the
   event itself.

   20. Speak in the temple. This is the end of their deliverance, that
   they employ themselves stoutly in preaching the gospel, and provoke
   their enemies courageously, until they die valiantly. For they were put
   to death at length when the hand of God ceased, after that they had
   finished their course; but now the Lord openeth the prison for them,
   that they may be at liberty to fulfill their function. That is worth
   the marking, because we see many men, who, after they have escaped out
   of persecution, do afterwards keep silence, as if they had done their
   duty towards God, (and were no more to be troubled;) other some, also,
   do escape away by denying Christ; but the Lord doth deliver his
   children, not to the end they may cease off from the course which they
   have begun, but rather that they may be the more zealous afterward. The
   apostles might have objected, It is better to keep silence for a time,
   forasmuch as we cannot speak one word without danger; we are now
   apprehended for one only sermon, how much more shall the fury of our
   enemies be inflamed hereafter, if they shall see us make no end of
   speaking? But because they knew that they were to live and to die to
   the Lord, they do not refuse to do that which the Lord commanded; so we
   must always mark what function the Lord enjoineth us. There will many
   things meet us oftentimes, which may discourage us, unless being
   content with the commandment of God alone, we do our duty, committing
   the success to him.

   The words of this life. A singular commendation of the gospel, that it
   is a lively doctrine, bringing salvation unto men; for the
   righteousness of God is revealed unto us in it, (Romans 1:17;) and in
   it Christ offereth himself unto us with the sacrifice of his death,
   with the Spirit of regeneration, with the earnest of our adoption. And
   this is spoken expressly to the apostles, to the end they may the more
   courageously enter all manner of combats for the gospel, forasmuch as
   they hear that they are ministers of eternal salvation. The
   demonstrative is added for the more certainty, as if the angel did
   point out life with his finger, as assuredly we need not to seek the
   same far, when we have the word in our mouth and in our heart; unless
   peradventure some man had rather take it by hypallage, the words of
   this life, for these words, which I do not reject, yet that former
   sense me thinks is better, for it was a new revelation of Christ
   wherein they had life present.

   21. And when the chief priest came. The chief priest calleth all the
   council together now, lest, if giving the honor to his own sect, he
   omit others, and be not able to bear the burden; therefore, he is
   enforced by fear to call the multitude together, notwithstanding they
   observe diligently and straitly the form of law. The elders are called
   who did govern, that nothing may be done but according to the sentence
   and authority of the council. Who would not have hoped for a moderate
   end, seeing they began thus? and surely they pretend what color they
   can, lest they seem to oppress the truth violently and tyrannously; but
   when they hear that the apostles teach in the temple, howsoever they
   know that they came not out by deceit of man, but miraculously, yet
   they hold on still in their purpose; where appeareth, together with the
   ungodliness of behavior and contempt of God, horrible fury and want of
   reason. Therefore, the beautiful colors of right and equity [260] do
   never so cover hypocrites, but that they do at length betray their
   wickedness. They must need certainly gather by all circumstances, that
   it is the work of God that the prison was opened, yet they do not doubt
   openly to rage against God.

   These things are also meet for our time. We know how proudly the
   Papists boast of that maxim of theirs, that lawful councils must be
   obeyed, because they represent the Church. Moreover, they call those
   lawful councils, and they will have them so accounted, wherein nothing
   is wanting touching the external form, and such a council was this
   whereof Luke speaketh in this place; and yet, notwithstanding, we know
   that it was gathered to put out [261] the name of Christ; for although
   the priests did then creep in unto honor by subtlety, or by inordinate
   suit, [262] to win the favor of men, or by other wicked policies, or
   whether they burst in unto the same by bribery, or murder, [263] yet
   the dignity of the priesthood did continue as yet until Christ was
   revealed. There was in the assembly of the elders a representing of the
   Church; but where the truth of God is not sought, all outward
   appearance is nothing else but a mere visor. Therefore, it is in vain
   for the Papists to cover their abominations with the shadow of this
   buckler, because it is not sufficient for those to be gathered together
   who are rulers of the Church, unless they do this in the name of
   Christ, otherwise forasmuch as it is an usual policy of Satan to
   transform himself into an angel of light, (2 Corinthians 11:14,) we
   will grant him as fit a covert under the title of the Church as he can
   wish.

   He brought them without violence. We have spoken somewhat before of the
   captain of the temple. For I do not think [264] that it was lawful for
   the Jews to set and appoint whom they would to rule the temple, but
   that the president of the province did appoint one to have the
   government of the temple. And he saith, that they were brought without
   violence, that is, that they were not drawn violently, lest any tumult
   should arise, so that, whereas they neither fear nor reverence God,
   they are afraid of men. The apostles also do show their modesty in
   that, that whereas they are guided with a great number of men, yet do
   they suffer themselves to be led away by the officers, lest they should
   be authors of any tumult.

   Acts 5:27-28

   27. And when they had brought them, they set them before the council;
   and the chief priest asked them, 28. Saying, Did not we, in commanding,
   command you, that you should not teach in this name? And behold ye have
   filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and you will bring the blood of
   this man upon us.


   28. The chief priest layeth two crimes to the charge of the apostles,
   for he accuseth them of contumacy or stubbornness, [265] because they
   obeyed not the decree of the council. In the second member he betrayeth
   an evil conscience, or, at least, he showeth that he handled rather a
   private business than any public cause, for he complaineth that the
   apostles will cause the priests and the scribes to be hated for the
   death of Christ. Behold, therefore, what that is which nettleth them,
   because they fear the revenge and punishment of wicked murder. He
   pretendeth, at the first, doctrine; but we may gather out of the end
   that he was not so careful for doctrine. In the mean season, he
   accuseth the apostles of sedition; for he taketh that for a thing which
   all men, for the most part, did grant, [266] that Christ was put to
   death justly. Notwithstanding this is the principal point of the
   accusation, that they did not obey the commandment of the priests. It
   was an heinous offense not to obey the chief priest; how much more
   heinous was it, then, to despise the whole order? But the chief priest
   doth not consider what is his duty towards God and the Church; [267] he
   abuseth his authority tyrannously, as if the same were not under any
   laws, as the Pope dealeth with us at this day; for seeing that he
   taketh to himself an unbridled authority and government, he feareth not
   to condemn us for schismatics, so soon as he seeth us refuse his
   decrees; for he catcheth at these sentences: "He which despiseth you
   despiseth me," (Luke 10:16;) and thereupon he concludeth that we will
   rebel [268] against God. But if he will be heard as the ambassador of
   Christ, he must speak out of the mouth of Christ.

   Now, forasmuch as he doth manifestly play the minister of Satan, he
   borroweth authority, without shame and color, of the name of Christ;
   yea, the very form of speech which the chief priest useth doth prove
   how carelessly spiritual tyrants who usurp such authority and lordship
   as is not subject to the word of God, dare grant liberty to themselves
   to attempt whatsoever pleaseth them. With a commandment (saith he) have
   we commanded. Whence cometh such strait rigor, save only because they
   think that all that must be received without exception which they shall
   command?

   Acts 5:29-33

   29. And Peter and the apostles answering, said, We ought rather to obey
   God than men. 30. The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom ye
   slew, hanging him upon a tree. 31. Him God hath lifted up with his
   right hand, to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel,
   and remission of sins. 32. And we are his witnesses of these words [or
   things,] and the Holy Ghost also, whom God hath given to them that obey
   him. 33. And when they heard these things, they were cut in sunder, and
   would slay them.


   29. This is the sum of their answer, It is lawful for them, nay, they
   ought to prefer God before men. God commandeth us to bear witness of
   Christ; therefore it is in vain for you to command us to keep silence.
   But I have declared before in the third chapter, when this sentence
   taketh place, that we ought rather to obey God than men. God doth set
   men over us in such sort with power, that he keepeth still his own
   authority safe and sound. Therefore, we must obey rulers so far, that
   the commandment of God be not broken. Whereas power and authority is
   lawfully used, then it is out of season to make comparison between God
   and man. If a faithful pastor do command or forbid out of the Word of
   God, it shall be in vain for men which are stubborn to object that we
   ought to obey God; for God will be heard by man. Yea, man is nothing
   else but an instrument of God. If a magistrate do his duty as he ought,
   a man shall in vain say that he is contrary to God, seeing that he
   dissenteth in nothing; yea, rather the contrary rule is then in force.
   We must obey God's ministers and officers if we will obey him. [269]
   But so soon as rulers do lead us away from the obedience of God,
   because they strive against God with sacrilegious boldness, their pride
   must be abated, that God may be above all in authority. Then all smokes
   of honor vanish away. For God doth not vouchsafe to bestow honorable
   titles upon men, to the end they may darken his glory. Therefore, if a
   father, being not content with his own estate, do essay to take from
   God the chief honor of a father, he is nothing else but a man. If a
   king, or ruler, or magistrate, do become so lofty that he diminisheth
   the honor and authority of God, he is but a man. We must thus think
   also of pastors. For he which goeth beyond his bounds in his office,
   (because he setteth himself against God:) must be despoiled of his
   honor, lest, under a color or visor, he deceive. The office of a pastor
   is very excellent, the authority of the Church is great, yet so that no
   part of God's power and Christ's mastership be diminished. Whence we
   may easily gather that the pride of the Pope is ridiculous, who, when
   as he treadeth under foot the whole kingdom of Christ, and doth set
   himself openly against God, will yet, nevertheless, lie hid under the
   name of Christ. [270]

   30. The God of our fathers. They descend unto the matter whereof they
   are to speak, that they may declare that they made small account of the
   commandment of the priests, not without cause, nor yet unadvisedly. For
   (as I have already said) the comparison between God and man taketh no
   place save only when there is some contrariety. Therefore they prove by
   this, that they are enforced by the fear of God to refuse the
   commandment of the priests; because God commandeth that which they
   forbid. Therefore, first of all, they say that God had raised up
   Christ, after the common custom of the Scriptures. For this speech is
   common, that God raised up prophets or judges, or rather ministers,
   whom he determined to use into some great work; which importeth as much
   as that all excellency of nature is weak, unless God do furnish those
   with singular gifts whom he preferreth unto any excellent office.
   Peradventure, also they allude unto that famous place of Moses, which
   Peter cited in his first sermon, (Deuteronomy 18:15, above 3:22.) They
   cite the God of the fathers by name, as the author, that they may
   declare that they bring in no new form of religion, neither yet will
   they enforce upon the people any new god. For they were to make answer
   to that false slander, that they went about to lead away the people
   from the law and the prophets. Not that they allow all that worship
   which was used by the fathers, as profane men are content with this
   only argument, that the fathers taught thus, that they do all things
   according to the custom and decree of their ancestors; but the apostles
   speak in this place of those fathers with whom God hath made his
   covenant, who followeth right and pure doctrine, who embraceth the
   promise of salvation with true faith; finally, who had their beginning
   of the heavenly Father, and who, through the only begotten Son of God,
   were the children of God together with their posterity.

   Whom ye. In this member the apostles declare unto them plainly that
   they were the enemies of God who would have the chief honor given them
   as unto the governors and prelates of the Church. Whereupon it
   followeth that they are unworthy even of the smallest authority.
   Although there is also a prevention, being a token of boldness, when as
   he speaketh of that thing boldly and freely which they did account a
   shameful thing, to wit, lest any part of Christ's glory should seem to
   be diminished because he suffered a slanderous [271] death upon the
   cross; as if it had been said, You have slain him. Neither was your
   cruelty satisfied with a plain and common death; for he was hanged upon
   a tree. But neither could death extinguish his power; neither could
   that shame and reproach which he suffered amongst you take away his
   honor. Therefore the calling of God continueth firm and stable.
   Therefore, as the apostles hit the priests in the teeth with that
   wickedness and heinous offense which they had committed, so they
   prevent, by a granting, to express the manner of the reproachful death
   which Christ suffered, lest the authors of the wickedness triumph as
   having gotten the victory.

   31. Him has God lifted up. Therefore the apostles do signify that
   whatsoever the wicked do go about, it did not hinder and keep back
   Christ from fulfilling his function which was enjoined him by his
   Father. The right hand of God is taken for his power. Neither is the
   same metaphor used in this place, which we had before, chapter 2, and
   which is common elsewhere, when Christ is said to be lift up unto the
   right hand of the Father; but the meaning of this place is, that
   Christ, which was slain by the hand of men, was lifted up on high by
   the power of God, that he might bear rule over angels and men. And this
   seemeth secretly to be set against all the enterprises of Satan and the
   world; as if he should say that they shall have no good success,
   because they shall never climb so high as to hinder the hand of God,
   whereby he hath both wrought mightily already in his only begotten Son,
   neither will he ever cease to work. Yet the end is added also, that he
   may be a captain and Savior. For so often as God did put his people in
   hope of salvation, he was wont to promise a prince or a king, by whose
   hand he would restore all things. The apostles do testify that this
   principality was granted to Christ. Notwithstanding they do more
   plainly express his office by the other adjunct. [272] The sum is this,
   that Christ is placed in the highest degree of honor, that he may
   govern the people of God, and not that only, but that he may show
   himself to be a saving captain, or the author of salvation.

   To give repentance. They show in this place how Christ reigneth to save
   the people, to wit, when he bringeth his own to repentance, and doth
   reconcile them unto God through the remission of sins. Furthermore, we
   know that the sum of the gospel is contained in these two things.
   Wherefore the apostles do not only stand upon the defense of their
   cause, but they preach the office of Christ plentifully, [273] that
   they may win even some of the mortal enemies of Christ, [274] if it may
   be. Furthermore, we have declared before what the word repentance doth
   signify, to wit, that it is an inward turning of man unto God, which
   showeth itself afterwards by external works. For Christ giveth us the
   Spirit of regeneration for this cause, that he may renew us inwardly;
   to the end that a new life may afterward follow the newness of the mind
   and heart. And if it belong to Christ to give repentance, then it
   followeth that it is not a thing which is in man's power. And surely,
   seeing that it is a certain wonderful reformation, (or fashioning
   again,) which maketh us new creatures, repaireth in us the image of
   God, bringeth us out of the bondage of sin unto the obedience of
   righteousness; it is a thing as impossible for men to convert
   themselves as to create themselves. Repentance is, I grant, a voluntary
   conversion, but whence have we this will, save only because God
   changeth our heart, that it may be made fleshy of a stony heart;
   flexible, of hard and stubborn; and, finally, righteous of wicked,
   (Ezekiel 11:19.) And this cometh to pass when Christ regenerateth thus
   by his Spirit. Neither is this given in a moment, but it must be
   increased daily during our whole life, until we be fully joined to God;
   which shall be then when we have put off our flesh.

   This is, indeed, the beginning of repentance, when a man, who before
   was turned away from God, renounceth the world and himself, and doth
   purpose to lead a new life. But because when we have entered the way,
   we are far from the mark, we must needs go forward continually. We have
   [275] a both through the benefit of Christ. For as he beginneth
   repentance in us, so doth he also give us perseverance. This is an
   inestimable grace; but it should do us but a little good, unless it
   were coupled with forgiveness of sins. For Christ doth both find us the
   enemies of God at the first, and also there are always vices remaining
   in us, which cause disagreement between him and us; so that he may
   justly be offended with us, rather than merciful unto us. And therein
   doth our righteousness consist, if God do not impute our sins unto us.
   Therefore, this latter grace must never be separated from them. Yea,
   rather the gospel shall be lame [276] and corrupt, unless it consist
   upon [of] these two members, that is, unless men be taught that they
   are reconciled to God by Christ by the free imputation of
   righteousness, and that they are fashioned again unto newness of life
   by the Spirit of regeneration. So that we understand briefly how we
   must obtain salvation in Christ.

   32. And we are his witnesses. After that they have declared that their
   doctrine came from God, they descend now unto the other part that they
   speak as they were commanded by God, lest they seem to attempt anything
   unadvisedly. For this also was a necessary defense, as it is for all
   the ministers of the gospel, to wit, that they make this openly known
   to all men that they teach nothing but that which they have received of
   God. Secondly, that they are called hereunto, so that they cannot avoid
   the necessity of teaching, unless they will resist God. Luke putteth
   words in this place, instead of things, according to the Hebrew phrase.
   Although if any man had rather understand it of the speech itself, I do
   not deny but that it may be so. The sum is, seeing they are brought
   forth by God to be witnesses, they may not give back, [277] but they
   must publish things which he hath commanded.

   And also the Spirit. They confirm their calling by the effect; for this
   was a seal to approve their doctrine, seeing that God gave the Holy
   Spirit to those which believed. Forasmuch, as it appeared manifestly by
   this, that he allowed the faith of the gospel, and it was acceptable to
   him. In that they say to those which obey him, I refer it unto Christ,
   as if they should have said, those which believe in Christ are
   plentifully rewarded for their obedience. Therefore God will have
   Christ obeyed. Wherefore even our ministry doth please him in that
   thing. Yet here may a question be moved, Seeing that we have saith by
   the revelation of the Spirit, how is it said in this place, that the
   same is given after faith? I answer, that the gift of tongues, of
   prophecy, of interpretation, of healing, and such like, are spoken of
   in this place, wherewith God did beautiful his Church. As Paul saith,
   where he asketh the Galatians, whether they received the Spirit by the
   law, or by the hearing of faith, (Galatians 3:2.) Therefore the
   illumin-ation of the Spirit goeth before faith, because it is the cause
   thereof; but there follow other graces afterward, that we may go
   forward, according to that, "To him that hath shall be given," (Matthew
   13:12.) And if we will be enriched every now and then with new gifts of
   the Spirit, let us hold out unto God the lap of faith. [278] But the
   reward wherewith our want of faith is rewarded at this day is far
   unlike; [279] for the most part being destitute of the Spirit of God
   doth neither see nor understand anything.

   33. They were cut in sunder. The priests ought to have been thoroughly
   moved, though they had had hearts of iron, but they burst. [280] Whence
   we gather that no reasons can prevail with the reprobate, to bring them
   unto the obedience of Christ; for unless God speak within, the outward
   doctrine shall be able to do nothing else but to beat the ears. The
   apostles were able so to overcome their enemies, that they should not
   have had one word to say; but their fury was so untamed, and unbridled
   that they do rather go mad. Yet we must therewithal note the force of
   the word, because although the reprobate are not thereby changed, that
   they may become better, yet it pierceth into their hearts, so that it
   urgeth their consciences; for thence springeth their fury, because they
   saw themselves [281] urged by their judge. They would gladly mock all
   the gospel, as they attempt whatsoever they can, that they may count it
   as nothing; but there is in the same a certain hidden majesty, which
   driveth away mightily all their delicacy. [282] And chiefly when they
   are cited by the sound of the trumpet to appear before the
   judgment-seat of God, then appeareth their madness and fury.

   Acts 5:34-39

   34. And a certain Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law,
   precious to all the people, rising in the council, commanded the
   apostles to be carried out a little space. 35. Then he said unto them,
   Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves, what ye intend to do touching
   these men. 36. For before these days there arose one Theudas, saying,
   that he was some great man, to whom consented a number of men, about
   four hundred, who perished; and they were all scattered abroad which
   had obeyed him, and were brought to nought. 37. After him arose one
   Judas of Galilee, in the days of the tribute, and led away much people
   after him, and he likewise perished; and all which had obeyed him were
   scattered abroad. 38. Now, therefore, I say unto you, Abstain from
   these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of
   men, it shall come to nought: 39. But if it be of God, you cannot
   destroy it; lest, at any time, ye be found to fight with God.


   34. Luke showeth now after what manner God brought to nought the fury
   of the wicked. They were purposed to put the apostles to death;
   Gamaliel standeth up amidst them, to break off that mad consultation.
   Furthermore, he noteth the circumstances, to the end we may know how it
   could be, that one man could prevail so much against so many. He saith
   he was a Pharisee which sect was in great estimation, as we know. He
   saith that he was in price, or honored amongst the people; and they
   feared the people. Hereby it cometh to pass that they are the more
   afraid to do any thing contrary to his mind. So God doth oftentimes set
   sudden terrors against his enemies, (when they look not for them,)to
   stay their violence. Furthermore, Gamaliel commandeth the apostles to
   go aside, lest they should be the more emboldened by his words. For we
   must not think that he spake thus, because he did allow [283] the
   doctrine of the gospel, or that he meant to defend the same; but
   because he saw all the rest inflamed with fury, he being a man moderate
   and courteous, doth with sober speech temper that excess.

   But if we consider all things well, this judgment and opinion is unmeet
   for a wise man. I know that many count it as an oracle, but it
   appeareth sufficiently hereby that they judge amiss, because by this
   means men should abstain from all punishments, neither were any wicked
   fact any longer to be corrected. Yea, all helps of life were to be
   refused, which we cannot prolong one moment. [284] Both things are
   true, that no endeavor of men can destroy that which is of God; and
   that that which is of men is not so strong that it can stand. But he
   gathereth amiss hence, that men must sit still and say nothing in the
   mean season. We must rather mark what God commandeth us to do, and he
   will have us to restrain wickedness. To this end hath he appointed
   magistrates, and armed them with the sword; to this end hath he set
   elders over his Church, to bring the froward in order, and that they
   may not suffer sin licentiously to rage without punishment. Therefore
   it is gathered amiss that we must refrain from punishing, because God
   is sufficient of himself to take away evils. Although his whole counsel
   is such, Gamaliel willeth the scribes and elders to take heed that they
   make not open war against God. And he speaketh as it were touching a
   doubtful matter; whereby it appeareth that he hath no certainty from
   the foundation, when as he doubteth in the quality of the cause,
   neither dare set down whether it be good or evil, but doth only command
   to defer it for a time, until the cause appear more plainly.

   In sum, Gamaliel setteth an evil consequent from true grounds; [285]
   because he applieth that amiss unto the external office and manner of
   doing which ought to serve for faith only. On the other side, let this
   be our logic, That which is of God must needs stand, though all the
   world say nay; therefore faith must stand without all fear, against all
   the assaults of Satan and men, seeing faith is under-propped and
   supported with the eternal truth of God; although heaven fail, our
   salvation is safe, which hath God to be the author and keeper thereof;
   because God doth defend the kingdom of Christ, it can never be
   overthrown with any violence; because the doctrine of the gospel is
   grounded in God, howsoever men resist or shake the same, yet shall it
   nevertheless continue firm. Again, although the wicked attempt
   whatsoever they can, and seek all means [286] to destroy the Church,
   although they furiously strive against Christ and his Church so much as
   they are able, yet they shall not prevail, because it is the property
   of God to bring the counsels of men to nought; and by this means doth
   he punish their rashness. We see that both members are well applied to
   faith. But, in the mean season, there is no cause why the servants of
   Christ should be less diligent in maintaining the truth; why they
   should suffer the Church to decay through their fault; [287] why they
   should carelessly wink at their wickedness who endeavor to turn all
   things topsy-turvy.

   36. There arose one Theudas. If we credit Josephus, Gamaliel altereth
   in this place the true course of the history. For he reporteth that
   Judas Gaulanites, who was born in Gamala, at such time as Quirinius, or
   Cyrenius, was proconsul, did raise a tumult with his adherents, because
   they would not have their goods taxed; [288] and that Theudas, at such
   time as Cuspius Fadus was procurator, did boast that he was a prophet
   of God. And Fadus was sent into Judea by Claudius Caesar. The former
   history is recorded in the Eighteenth Book of Antiquities; and the
   other in the Twentieth. But I think that when Luke saith, After him was
   there one Judas, he meant not to note the course of time, as if he were
   the latter; but forasmuch as Gamaliel brought in two like examples, he
   might put the one in place of the other, [289] without having respect
   of time. Therefore the word post is as much as moreover, or besides.

   Furthermore, even these examples wherewith Gamaliel confirmeth his
   opinion do not sufficiently agree with the present cause. For, because
   they did not by and by resist Judas, that sedition which he had raised
   was the occasion of many murders, and at length he was vanquished with
   hand and weapon. Theudas also had done far more hurt, unless he had
   been put to flight in time by Cuspius Fadus. But Gamaliel hath respect
   unto this alone, that men have unlucky success when as they advance
   themselves un-advisedly; and that cometh to pass by the just judgment
   of God. But because the priests refuse to hearken when God giveth them
   good counsel, they are worthy to be made amazed by man with frivolous
   reasons, wavering hither and thither through foolish perplexity.
   Furthermore, if we cast the time, we shall find that it was twelve
   years at least after the death of Christ before the apostles were
   beaten. For unto the five years which remained of the government of
   Tiberius, we must add three and a half which Caligula reigned. Fadus
   was not sent by Claudius into Judea before the second or third year of
   his reign. Gamaliel rehearsed not the act within a day or two after.
   Therefore that space of time is complete whereof I spake. Wherefore the
   constancy of the apostles was the more excellent, who, though they be
   so evil rewarded for those long pains which they had endured, yet are
   they not discouraged, neither do they cease to hold on as they had
   begun.

   That he was some great man. Some books [290] have, Saying that he was
   somebody; yet both carry one sense. For he boasted that he was such a
   prophet that he could dry up Jordan, that those which were with him
   might go over dry foot. Nevertheless, we see how far Gamaliel is from
   true knowledge, who compareth the holy ministers of Christ unto
   seducers and robbers; although he mitigateth his words afterward, and,
   inclining toward the better part, leaveth it indifferent whether they
   have taken this matter in hand, having God for their author or no. Yet
   he speaketh doubtfully, because he provideth [291] only for quietness,
   all inquiry being set apart. This is only to be allowed [292] in his
   speech, that he feareth [deterreth] the wicked from wicked boldness,
   because there is nothing more to be feared than to strive against God.

   Acts 5:40-42

   40. And they obeyed him. And when they had called the apostles, having
   beaten them, they commanded them that they should not speak in the name
   of Jesus; and they let them go. 41. Therefore they went rejoicing from
   the face of the council, because they were counted worthy to suffer
   reproach for his name. 42. And they did not cease daily in the temple,
   and in every house, to teach and preach Christ Jesus.


   40. Having beaten them, they commanded. He saith that Gamaliel's
   counsel was allowed; yet the apostles are beaten, and forbidden to
   preach. [293] Hereby we gather how great the rage of the enemies was,
   who being now pacified, or at least mitigated, do yet, notwithstanding,
   rage immoderately. [294] And it appeareth also what evil success those
   doubtful counsels have, wherein men alone are respected, and the truth
   of God set aside. Gamaliel obtaineth thus much, that the lives of the
   apostles may be saved; [295] but, in the mean season, the Son of God is
   blasphemed and slandered in their person; the truth of the gospel is
   buried in eternal silence, so much as in the enemies lieth, God surely
   doth by this means wonderfully spread abroad his word; yet that counsel
   ceaseth not to be evil. Which we must note for this cause, because most
   men at this day do think, that they do not a little obey God, if they
   save the lives of those men which come in hazard for the doctrine of
   the gospel, or somewhat appease [296] the enemies who are otherwise
   bloody. In the mean season, they are not afraid to drive them unto the
   wicked denial of Christ, the confessing of whom is far more precious in
   the sight of God than the life of all men. But what could they do who,
   casting away all care of godliness, go about to redeem God's favor with
   the duty of courtesy? [297]

   41. Then they went rejoicing. We must not think that the apostles were
   so senseless but that they felt some shame and did also lament, when
   they felt the punishment; for they had not quite put off nature; [298]
   but when they considered the cause, then joy got the upperhand. So the
   faithful must be two manner of ways affectioned so often as they suffer
   persecution for the gospel; they must be touched with the bitterness of
   punishments, [299] yet so that they overcome this sorrow with spiritual
   joy. For they should have (changed their mind, and) stricken sail by
   and by, unless they had been strengthened and encouraged by that joy.
   [300] And it is not to be doubted, but that even death was sweet, and
   pleasant to Peter on this fashion, which, notwithstanding the Lord doth
   testify shall be bitter unto him. Let us, therefore, learn that we must
   wrestle with sorrow and care, [301] that we hold on courageously to
   suffer the cross, and that we bear the same when it is laid upon us.

   That they were counted worthy. This might seem at the first blush
   absurd, in that Luke placeth honor in reproach; [302] but the
   disagreement which is between God and the world causeth this, that that
   which is counted amongst men most reproachful, excelleth in dignity and
   glory in the sight of God and his angels. We know that the kind of
   death which Christ suffered was of all other most shameful, and yet did
   he triumph most nobly upon the cross; so, when we are made like unto
   him, we may worthily boast that it is a point of singular excellency,
   that we suffer rebuke in the sight of the world. Thus doth Paul boast
   of the marks of Christ, (Galatians 6:17.) For we must here respect the
   cause which doth associate us unto Christ, [303] who doth not only
   swallow up the shame of the world with his glory, but doth also turn
   reproaches, slanders, and mocks of the world, into great honor.
   Wherefore, it is no marvel that there be so few found which are strong
   and stout to bear the cross, because we are almost all drowned and
   overwhelmed with the sense of the flesh; and there is scarce one
   amongst an hundred which considereth that the reproach of Christ doth
   far excel all the triumphs of the world, which is the only matter of
   comfort. Wherefore, we must use the greater diligence in thinking upon
   this sentence; that we are at this day made partakers [304] of the
   sufferings of Christ, that we may be partakers of his glory.

   42. They ceased not. Constancy did also accompany their Joy. For how is
   it that we are discouraged with persecution, save only because none
   lifteth up himself unto Christ, that he may in mind lay hold upon the
   fruit of victory, and so be pricked forward unto patience? But that man
   which thinketh with himself that he is happy when he suffereth for
   Christ's sake, shall never faint, though he must suffer hard conflicts.
   Therefore the apostles are, after a sort, armed with stripes, so that
   they valiantly make haste unto death. Therefore, woe be to our
   daintiness, who, having suffered a little persecution, do by and by
   resign up the light [305] to another, as if we were now old worn
   soldiers.

   CHAPTER 6
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 6:1-6

   1. And in those days, when the number of the disciples grew, there
   arose a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, because their
   widows were despised in the daily ministry. 2. Therefore, when the
   twelve had called unto them the multitude of the disciples, they said,
   It doth not please [or it is not good] that we should serve tables,
   having left the word of God. 3. Therefore, brethren, look out seven men
   of you, of known honesty, full of the Holy Ghost, and of wisdom, whom
   we will appoint over this business, 4. And we will give ourselves unto
   prayer, and to the ministration of the word. 5. The speech pleased the
   whole multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the
   Holy Ghost; and Philip, and Prochorus, [Nicanor,] and Timon, and
   Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch; 6. These did they set
   before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands
   upon them.


   1. Luke declareth here upon what occasion, and to what end, and also
   with what rite, deacons were first made. He saith, When there arose a
   murmuring amongst the disciples, it was appeased by this remedy, as it
   is said in the common proverb, Good laws have taken their beginning of
   evil manners. And it may seem to be a strange thing, seeing that this
   is a function so excellent and so necessary in the Church, why it came
   not into the apostles' minds at the first, (before there was any such
   occasion ministered,) to appoint deacons, and why the Spirit of God did
   not give them such counsel which they take now, being, as it were,
   enforced thereunto. But that which happened was both better then, and
   is also more profitable for us at this day, to be unto us an example.
   If the apostles had spoken of choosing deacons before any necessity did
   require the same, they should not have had the people so ready; they
   should have seemed to avoid labor and trouble; many would not have
   offered so liberally into the hands of other men. Therefore, it was
   requisite that the faithful should be convict [convinced] by experience
   that they might choose deacons willingly, whom they saw they could not
   want; and that through their own fault.

   We learn in this history that the Church cannot be so framed by and by,
   but that there remain somewhat to be amended; neither can so great a
   building be so finished in one day, that there may not something be
   added to make the same perfect. Furthermore, we learn that there is no
   ordinance of God so holy and laudable, which is not either corrupt or
   made unprofitable through the fault of men. We wonder that things are
   never so well ordered in the world, but that there is always some evil
   mixed with the good; but it is the wickedness and corruption of our
   nature which causeth this. That was, indeed, a godly order, whereof
   Luke made mention before, when the goods of all men being consecrated
   to God, were distributed to every man as he had need; [306] when as the
   apostles, being, as it were, the stewards of God and the poor, had the
   chief government of the alms. But shortly after there ariseth a
   murmuring which troubleth this order. Here appeareth that corruption of
   men whereof I have spoken, which doth not suffer us to use our good
   things. We must also mark the subtilty [307] of Satan, who, to the end
   he may take from us the use of the gifts of God, goeth about this
   continually, that it may not remain pure and sound; but that, being
   mixed with other discommodities, it may, first, be suspected, secondly,
   loathed, and, lastly, quite taken away. But the apostles have taught
   us, by their example, that we must not yield unto such engines (and
   policies) of Satan. For they do not think it meet (being offended with
   the murmuring) to take away that ministry which they know pleaseth God;
   but rather invent a remedy whereby the offense may be taken away, and
   that may be retained which is God's. Thus must we do. For what offenses
   soever Satan raise, [308] we must take good heed that he take not from
   us those ordinances which are otherwise wholesome.

   The number increasing. We ought to wish for nothing more than that God
   would increase his Church, and gather together many [309] on every side
   unto his people; but the corruption of our nature hindereth us from
   having any thing happy in all points. For there arise many
   discommodities also, even of the increasings of the Church. For it is a
   hard matter to keep many hypocrites from creeping into the multitude,
   whose wickedness is not by and by discovered, until such time as they
   have infected some part of the flock with their infection. Moreover,
   many wicked, froward, and dissolute persons do insinuate themselves
   under a false color of repentance. And that I may pass over innumerable
   things, there is never such agreement amongst many, but that, according
   to the diversity of their manners, their opinions are also diverse, so
   that one thing cannot please all alike. This offense causeth many to be
   desirous to choose a few for a Church; it causeth them to loathe or
   else to hate a multitude. But no trouble, no irksomeness, ought so much
   to prevail, but that we must always be desirous to have the Church
   increased; but that we must study to enlarge the same; but that we must
   cherish so much as in us lieth unity with the whole body.

   A murmuring of the Greeks. Hereby it appeareth that they were not fully
   regenerate by the Spirit of God, to whom the diversity of nation and
   country ministereth occasion of disagreement. For in Christ there is
   neither Jew nor Grecian, (Galatians 3:28.) Therefore, this indignation
   smelleth [310] of the flesh and the world. Wherefore we must take good
   heed that the like fault be not found in us. [311] There is another
   fault in that they declare their indignation by murmuring. Furthermore
   it is uncertain whether the complaint were true or no. For when Luke
   saith that the Greeks murmured, because their widows were not honored,
   he showeth not what was done in deed, but what they thought was done.
   And it may be that forasmuch as the apostles did prefer the Jews, [312]
   because they were better known, the Greeks did think (though falsely)
   that their widows were despised as strangers. And this seemeth to be
   more like to be true. Furthermore the word ministering may be expounded
   two manner of ways, actively or passively. For we know that at the
   first there were widows chosen unto the ministration. [313]
   Notwithstanding, I do rather think that the Greeks did complain,
   because their widows were not so liberally relieved as they wished. So
   that the ministration shall be that daily distribution which was wont
   to be made.

   2. The twelve having the multitude called unto them It is a point
   [proof] of patience and meekness that the apostles are no more moved.
   [314] It is a point of prudence and godly carefulness, in that they
   prevent the evil which began to arise, [315] without deferring the
   remedy. For after that every dissension and division hath gathered
   strength, it is a wound hard to be cured. By this assembly it appeareth
   that the Church was governed by order and reason, so that the apostles
   had the chiefest authority, and that they did impart their counsels and
   purposes unto the people. [316] Again, we must note that the faithful,
   or Christians, are in this place called disciples, in whom that of
   Isaiah must be fulfilled, "That they were all taught of God." And
   again, that of Jeremiah, "They shall all know God, from the least to
   the greatest."

   It pleaseth not. It is in Greek [ouk areston] By which word, the
   Grecians do now express every opinion or decree which is better than
   another, or which is to be preferred as being better. [317] I do rather
   think that the apostles declare what is profitable, than simply what
   they have decreed. But if it be not expedient for them to meddle with
   this business, [318] they seem [now] to acknowledge some fault in that
   they ministered hitherto. And surely that is true, that use is the
   father of wisdom. [319] Wherefore there shall be no absurdity if we
   shall say, that the apostles desire of the Church to be unburdened of
   that function, after that they have tried [experienced] that it is not
   meet for them. But if there were any fault, it ought rather to be
   ascribed unto necessity than unto them; for they took not this burthen
   upon them greedily, but seeing there was no other way as yet, they had
   better burthen themselves out of measure than that the poor should be
   forslowed. [320] And when as they say that it is not meet that they
   should be occupied in providing for the poor, their meaning is, that
   are unable to endure both burthens, so that they must needs let the one
   alone. For it is as if they should say, If thou wilt enjoy our ministry
   in the preaching of the gospel, deliver us from the charge of the poor,
   because we are not able to do both. But this seemeth to be spoken out
   of season by them, because they had not left the charge of teaching
   before, although they had the oversight of the alms. I answer,
   forasmuch as the administration was confused, they were so enwrapped,
   [321] that they could not wholly attend upon doctrine as was meet.
   Therefore, they refuse that function which draweth them away from the
   free and perfect [322] charge of teaching. Notwithstanding, we may not
   think that they had quite cast away all care of the poor, but that they
   did only seek somewhat to be lightened and eased, that they might
   attend upon their office. And, in the mean season, they declare that
   the ministry of the word is so painful [323] that it requireth a whole
   man, neither will it suffer him to be occupied about any other
   business; which, if it had been well considered, there had been a far
   other order taken in the Church.

   The Popish bishops did suck [324] up great riches under color of the
   ministration or deaconship; nevertheless, they entangled themselves in
   divers businesses, which they were scarce able to overcome, [325]
   though every one of them had had ten heads. Notwithstanding, such is
   their wickedness, that they say that there can be no church unless it
   be drowned in this depth; [326] neither do they cease to brag and boast
   that they are the successors of the apostles, whereas there is nothing
   which appeareth to be more contrary. They were careful for this, that
   they might not be occupied about serving of tables, and so be compelled
   to leave their own banquets. For whosoever is careful for his own
   table, he taketh leave to be vacant [327] from other men's tables.

   But omitting these things, let us mark this sentence. We know what a
   holy thing it is to be careful for the poor. Therefore, forasmuch as
   the apostles prefer the preaching of the gospel before if we gather
   thereby that no obedience is more acceptable to God. Notwithstanding,
   the hardness is also declared, [328] when as they say that they cannot
   discharge both these duties. Surely we are not better than they.
   Therefore, let every one of us that is called unto the function of
   teaching addict himself wholly to order this his estate well. [329] For
   we are inclined to nothing more than to fall to slothfulness. Again,
   the flesh ministereth goodly cloaks and colors, so that those men
   cannot see by and by that they are led away from their calling which
   enwrap themselves in strange business. Wherefore, to the end ministers
   may prick forward themselves to do their duty, let them remember this
   saying of the apostles oftentimes, wherein they declare that, forasmuch
   as they are called unto the function of teaching, they must not any
   longer take charge of the poor. Therefore, what excuses have profane
   affairs [330] (taken in hand even for some private gain) where that is
   set aside, which is otherwise accounted no small part of the worship of
   God.

   3. Therefore, brethren, look out. Now we see to what end deacons were
   made. The word itself is indeed general, yet is it properly taken for
   those which are stewards for the poor. Whereby it appeareth how
   licentiously the Papists do mock God and men, who assign unto their
   deacons no other office but this, to have the charge of [331] the paten
   and chalice. Surely we need no disputation to prove that they agree in
   no point with the apostles. But if the readers be desirous to see any
   more concerning this point, they may repair unto our Institution,
   chapter 8. As touching this present place, the Church is permitted to
   choose. For it is tyrannous if any one man appoint or make ministers at
   his pleasure. [332] Therefore, this is the (most) lawful way, that
   those be chosen by common voices [333] who are to take upon them [334]
   any public function in the Church. And the apostles prescribe what
   manner [of] persons ought to be chosen, to wit, men of tried honesty
   and credit, [335] men endued with wisdom [336] and other gifts of the
   Spirit. And this is the mean between tyranny and confused liberty,
   [337] that nothing be done without [338] the consent and approbation of
   the people, yet so that the pastors moderate and govern (this action,
   [339] ) that their authority may be as a bridle to keep under the
   people, [340] lest they pass their bounds too much. In the mean season,
   this is worth the noting, that the apostles prescribe an order unto the
   faithful, lest they appoint any save those which are fit. For we do God
   no small injury if we take all that come to hand [341] to govern his
   house. Therefore, we must use great circumspection that we choose none
   [342] unto the holy function of the Church unless we have some trial of
   him first. The number of seven is applied [343] unto the present
   necessity, lest any man should think [344] that there is some mystery
   comprehended under the same. Whereas Luke saith, full of the Spirit and
   wisdom, I do interpret it thus, that it is requisite that they be
   furnished both with other gifts of the Spirit, and also with wisdom,
   [345] without which that function cannot be exercised well, both that
   they may beware of the leger-demain [346] of those men, who being too
   much given unto begging, require [347] that which is necessary for the
   poverty of the brethren, and also of their slanders, who cease not to
   backbite, though they have none occasion given them. For that function
   is not only painful, but also subject to many ungodly murmurings. [348]

   4. And we will give ourselves unto prayer. They show again that they
   have too much business otherwise, wherein they may exercise themselves
   during their whole life. For the old proverb agreeth hereunto very
   fitly, which was used sometimes in the solemn rites, do this.
   Therefore, they use the word [proskarteresai] which signifieth to be,
   as it were, fastened and tied to anything. Therefore, pastors must not
   think that they have so done their duty that they need to do no more
   when they have daily spent some time in teaching. There is another
   manner of study, another manner of zeal, another manner of continuance
   [349] required, that they may [350] indeed boast that they are wholly
   given to that thing. They adjoin thereunto prayer, not that they alone
   ought to pray, (for that is an exercise common to all the godly,) but
   because they have peculiar causes to pray above all others. There is no
   man which ought not to be careful for the common salvation of the
   Church. How much more, then, ought the pastor, who hath that function
   enjoined him by name to labor carefully [anxiously] for it? So Moses
   did indeed exhort others unto prayer, but he went before them as the
   ringleader [351] (Exodus 17:11.) And it is not without cause that Paul
   doth so often make mention of his prayers, (Romans 1:10.) Again, we
   must always remember that, that we shall lose all our labor bestowed
   upon plowing, sowing, and watering, unless the increase come from
   heaven, (1 Corinthians 3:7.) Therefore, it shall not suffice to take
   great pains in teaching, unless we require the blessing at the hands of
   the Lord, that our labor may not be in vain and unfruitful. Hereby it
   appeareth that the exercise of prayer [352] is not in vain commended
   unto the ministers of the word.

   5. Stephen, full of faith. Luke doth not, therefore, separate faith
   from the Spirit, as if it also were not a gift of the Spirit; but by
   Spirit he meaneth other gifts wherewith Stephen was endued, as zeal,
   wisdom, uprightness, brotherly love, diligence, integrity of a good
   conscience; secondly, he expresseth the principal kind. Therefore, he
   signifieth that Stephen did excel first in faith, and, secondly, in
   other virtues; so that it was evident that he had abundance of the
   grace of the Spirit. He doth not so greatly commend the rest, because
   undoubtedly they were inferior to him. Moreover, the ancient writers
   do, with great consent, affirm that this Nicholas, which was one of the
   seven, is the same of whom John maketh mention in the Revelation,
   (Revelation 2:15,) to wit, that he was an author of a filthy and wicked
   sect; forasmuch as he would have women to be common. For which cause we
   must not be negligent in choosing ministers of the Church. For if the
   hypocrisy of men do deceive even those which are most vigilant and
   careful to fake heed, what shall befall the careless and negligent?
   Notwithstanding, if when we have used such circumspection as is meet,
   it so fall out that we be deceived, let us not be troubled out of
   measure; forasmuch as Luke saith that even the apostles were subject to
   this inconvenience. Some will ask this question, then, what good shall
   exhortation do? to what use serveth prayer, seeing that the success
   itself showeth that the election was not wholly governed by the Spirit
   of God? I answer, that this is a great matter that the Spirit directed
   their judgments in choosing six men; in that he suffereth the Church to
   go astray in the seventh, it ought to seem no absurd thing. For it is
   requisite that we be thus humbled divers ways, partly that the wicked
   and ungodly may exercise us; partly that, being taught by their
   example, we may learn to examine ourselves thoroughly, lest there be in
   us any hidden and privy starting-corners of guile; [353] partly that we
   may be more circumspect to discern, and that we may, as it were, keep
   watch continually, lest we be deceived by crafty and unfaithful men.
   Also it may be that the ministry of Nicholas was for a time profitable,
   and that he fell afterward into that monstrous error. And if so be it
   he fell in such sort from such an honorable degree, the higher that
   every one of us shall be extolled, let him submit himself unto God with
   modesty and fear.

   6. Having prayed, they laid their hands upon them. Laying on of hands
   was a solemn sign of consecration under the law. To this end do the
   apostles now lay their hands upon the deacons, that they may know that
   they are offered to God. Notwithstanding, because this ceremony should
   of itself be vain, they add thereunto prayer, wherein the faithful
   commend unto God those ministers whom they offer unto him. This is
   referred unto the apostles, for all the people did not lay their hands
   upon the deacons; but when the apostles did make prayer in the name of
   the Church, others also did add their petitions. Hence we gather that
   the laying on of hands is a rite agreeing unto order and comeliness,
   forasmuch as the apostles did use the same, and yet that it hath of
   itself no force or power, but that the effect dependeth upon the Spirit
   of God alone; which is generally to be thought of all ceremonies.

   Acts 6:7-10

   7. Furthermore, the word of God grew, and the number of the disciples
   increased greatly at Jerusalem, and a great company of the priests
   obeyed the faith. 8. And Stephen, full of faith and power, wrought
   wonders and great signs amongst the people. 9. But there arose certain
   of the synagogue, which was called the synagogue of the Libertines and
   Cyrenians, and of Alexandria, and of those which were of Cilicia and
   Asia, disputing with Stephen. 10. And they could not resist the wisdom
   and spirit wherewith he spake.


   Luke setteth forth again the increasing of the Church, to the end he
   may the better declare the power of God and his grace in the continual
   going forward thereof. This was an excellent work of God that the
   Church should suddenly, and, as it were, in a moment, be raised up; but
   this is worthy no less admiration, in that he furthereth that work
   which he had begun amidst so many lets, in that the number of these is
   increased, whom to diminish, and so, consequently, to destroy the whole
   stock, the world doth so greatly labor. In that he saith that the Word
   of God did grow, his meaning is, that it was spread further abroad. The
   Word of God is said to grow two manner of ways; either when new
   disciples are brought to obey the same, or as every one of us profiteth
   and goeth forward therein Luke speaketh in this place of the former
   sort of increasing, for he expoundeth himself by and by, when he
   speaketh of the number of the disciples. Notwithstanding, he
   restraineth this so great an increasing of faith unto one city. For
   although it be to be thought that the disciples were scattered abroad
   elsewhere, yet was there no certain body save only at Jerusalem.

   And a great company. Seeing that (in speaking properly) our faith doth
   obey the doctrine of the gospel, it is a figurative speech, uttered by
   metonymia, when Luke saith. That they obeyed the faith; for the word
   faith is taken by him for the Word of God, and the very profession of
   Christianity. And he reckoneth up the priests by name, because they
   were for the most part enemies; for which cause it was a wonderful work
   of God that some should be converted, and much more wonderful that
   many. For at the first they raged against Christ with this brag, "Hath
   any of the rulers believed in him? But this multitude, which knoweth
   not the law, are accursed."

   8. And Stephen Luke reciteth in this place a new combat of the Church,
   whereby it appeareth that the glory of the gospel was always joined
   with the cross and divers troubles. And this is the sum, that the
   Church was assaulted in the person of one man. Whereby it came to pass
   that the enemies were the more bold, and being imbrued with innocent
   blood, did rage sorer than they had wont; for they had not gone as yet
   beyond the prison and rods. But to the end we may know that the name of
   Christ was glorified as well in the life as in the death of Stephen,
   Luke saith at the first, that he was full of faith and power. Whereby
   he signifieth that his faith was excellent, and that he excelled in
   power to do miracles. Neither ought we to imagine perfection of faith,
   because he is said to be full of faith; but this manner of speaking is
   much used in the Scripture, to call those full of the gifts of God who
   are abundantly endued with the same. I take power (without question)
   for ability to do miracles. Faith comprehendeth not only the gift of
   understanding, but also the ferventness of zeal. Forasmuch as his name
   was famous by reason of his excellency, it came thereby to pass that
   the rage of the wicked was bent against him, as it were, with one
   consent, to overthrow him. [354] For so soon as the force and grace of
   the Spirit doth show itself, the fury of Satan is by and by provoked.

   And it shall appear by the text that Stephen was diligent and
   courageous in spreading abroad the doctrine of the gospel; but Luke
   passeth over that, being content to have commended his faith, which
   could not be slothful and sluggish.

   9. And there arose certain. This was the beginning of persecution,
   because the wicked, after that they have essayed in vain to set
   themselves against Christ by disputing, when they saw that that former
   attempt did take none effect, they fly unto slanders, (caviling,) and
   tumults, and at length they break out into violence and murder.
   Therefore, Luke meaneth by the word rise, that those of whom he
   speaketh did assault the gospel with their tongue, and did not, by and
   by, bring Stephen before the judgment-seat, but did first set upon him,
   by disputing against him. Furthermore, he signifieth that they were
   strangers, which lived in Judea, either that they might exercise
   merchandise, or else get learning. Therefore he saith that some of them
   were Cyrenians, some of Alexandria, some of Cilicia, some of Asia. He
   saith that they were all of the synagogue of the Libertines. It is to
   be thought that the free men of the citizens of Rome had caused a
   synagogue to be builded of their own charges, that it might be proper
   to the Jews which came together out of the provinces. [355]

   Therefore, those which were brought thither by the grace of God, and
   ought to have embraced Christ so much the more willingly, assault him
   first, and inflame the fury of others, as it were with a trumpet. Also
   Luke will in many other places afterward declare that the Jews, which
   were scattered abroad in the provinces, were most deadly enemies to
   sound doctrine: and most venomous [356] in moving tumults. He reckoneth
   up many, to the end the victory of the truth may be more famous, whilst
   that in any, gathered of divers countries, depart, being vanquished by
   one man; and it is not to be doubted but that they were enforced to
   hold their peace with shame. Stephen had already won great favor, and
   gotten great dignity by miracles. [357] He answereth the disputers now
   in such sort that he getteth the upper hand much. He putteth not that
   wisdom and spirit which he saith his adversaries could not gainstand,
   as divers things. Therefore resolve these words thus: They could not
   resist the wisdom which the Spirit of God gave him. For Luke meant to
   express that they fought not on both sides as men; but that the enemies
   of the gospel were therefore discouraged and overcome, because they did
   strive against the Spirit of God, which spake by the mouth of Stephen.
   And forasmuch as Christ hath promised the same Spirit to all his
   servants, let us only defend the truth faithfully, and let us crave a
   mouth and wisdom of him, and we shall be sufficiently furnished to
   speak, so that neither the wit, neither yet the babbling of our
   adversaries, shall be able to make us ashamed. So the Spirit was as
   effectual in our time in the mouth of the martyrs which were burnt, and
   it uttereth the like force now daily, that though they were ignorant

   Acts 6:11-15

   11. Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard this man speak
   blasphemous words against Moses and God. 12. And they moved the people,
   and the elders, and the scribes. And invading him, they took him and
   brought him into the council. 13. And they brought forth false
   witnesses) which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words
   against this holy place and the law. 14. For we have heard him say,
   That this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change
   the ordinances which Moses hath given us. 15. And when all which sat in
   the council had beholden him, they saw his face as it had been the face
   of an angel.


   12. Being overcome with the power of the Spirit, they give over
   disputing, but they prepare false witnesses, that with false and
   slanderous reports, they may oppress him; whereby it appeareth that
   they did strive with an evil conscience. For what can be more unmeet
   than in their cause to lean unto lies? [359] Admit he were a wicked
   man, and guilty, yet he must not have false witness borne against him.
   [360] But hypocrites, which shroud themselves under zeal, do carelessly
   grant themselves leave to do that. We see how the Papists at this day
   corrupt manifest places of Scripture, and that wittingly, whilst that
   they will falsely wrest testimonies against us. I confess, indeed, that
   they offend for the most part through ignorance; yet can we find none
   of them which doth not grant himself liberty to corrupt both the sense
   and also the words of the Scripture, that they may bring our doctrine
   into contempt; [361] yea, they slander us monstrously even in the
   pulpit. If you ask these Rabbins, whether it be lawful to slander a man
   or no, they will deny that it is lawful generally; but when they come
   unto us, good zeal doth excuse them, because they think that nothing is
   unlawful which may burden us or our cause; therefore they flatter
   themselves in lying, falsehood, and dogged impudence. Such hypocrisy
   did also blind them of whom Luke speaketh in this place, which used
   false witness to put Stephen to death; for when Satan reigneth, he doth
   not only prick forward the reprobate unto cruelty, but also blind their
   eyes, so that they think that they may do whatsoever they will. We are
   specially taught by this example, how dangerous the color of good zeal
   is, unless it be governed by the Spirit of God; for it breaketh out
   always into furious madness, and, in the mean season, it is a marvelous
   visor to cover all manner of wickedness.

   14. We have heard It shall full well appear by Stephen's defense, that
   he never spake anything touching Moses or the temple without reverence;
   and yet, notwithstanding, this was not laid to his charge for nothing,
   for he had taught the abrogating of the law. But they are false
   witnesses in this, and suborned to lie, because they corrupt purposely
   those things which were well and godly spoken. So Christ was enforced
   to clear himself, that he came, not to destroy the law, but to fulfill
   the law; because, when he had preached of abrogating the ceremonies,
   the wicked wrested this unto another purpose, as if he meant to abolish
   and take away the whole law. Furthermore, they wrested that wickedly
   unto the temple of Jerusalem, which he spake of his body. What, was it
   not objected to Paul, that he taught, "That evil is to be done, that
   good may come thereof?"

   Therefore, there is no cause why we should wonder at this day that that
   is so falsely misconstrued which we teach godly, well, and profitably;
   yea, we must rather persuade ourselves thus, that the doctrine of the
   gospel can never be handled so warily and moderately, but that it shall
   be subject to false accusations; for Satan, who is the father of lying,
   doth always bestir himself in his office. Again, because there be many
   things which are contrary to the reason of the flesh, men are inclined
   to nothing more than to admit false reports, which corrupt the true and
   sincere sense of doctrine. This malice of Satan, and the sleights,
   ought to make us more wary and more circumspect that no preposterous
   thing, or anything that is improperly spoken, escape us, wherewith they
   may be armed to fight against us; for we must carefully cut off from
   the wicked that occasion whereat they snatch. And if we see that,
   doctrine, which is by us well and godly delivered, corrupted, deformed,
   and torn in pieces with false reports, we must not repent that we have
   begun, neither yet is there any cause why we should be more slack
   hereafter; for it is not meet that we should be flee from the poisoned
   and venomous bitings of Satan, which the Son of God himself could not
   escape. In the mean season, it is our part and duty to dash and put
   away those lies wherewith the truth of God is burdened, like as we see
   Christ free the doctrine of the gospel from unjust infamy. Only let us
   so prepare ourselves that such indignity and dishonest dealing may not
   hinder us in our course.

   Because we teach that men are so corrupt, that they are altogether
   slaves unto sin and wicked lusts, the enemies do thereupon infer this
   false accusation, that we deny that men sin willingly, but that they
   are enforced thereunto by some other means, so that they are not in the
   fault, neither bear any blame; yea, they say farther, that we quench
   altogether all desire to do well. Because we deny that the works of
   holy men are for their own worthiness meritorious, because they have
   always some fault or imperfection in them, they cavil that we put no
   difference between the good and the evil. [362] Because we say that
   man's righteousness consisteth in the grace of God alone, and that
   godly souls can find rest nowhere else, save only in the death of
   Christ; they object that by this means we grant liberty to the flesh,
   (to do whatsoever it will,) that the use of the law may no longer
   remain. When as we maintain the honor of Christ, which they bestow as
   it pleaseth them here and there, after that they have rent it in a
   thousand pieces like a prey; they feign that we are enemies to the
   saints, they falsely report that we seek the licentiousness of the
   flesh instead of the liberty of the Spirit. Whilst that we endeavor to
   restore the Supper of the Lord unto his pure and lawful use; they cry
   out impudently that we overthrow and destroy the same. Others also
   which take away all things, as did the Academics, because that doth not
   please them which we teach concerning the secret predestination of God,
   and that out of the Scriptures, lay to our charge despitefully, that we
   make God a tyrant which taketh pleasure in putting innocent men to
   death, seeing that he hath already adjudged those unto eternal death
   which are as yet unborn, and other such things as can be said on this
   behalf; whereas, notwithstanding, they are sufficiently convicted that
   we think reverently of God, and that we speak no otherwise than he
   teacheth with his own mouth. It is a hard matter to endure such envy,
   yet must we not therefore cease off to defend a good cause. For the
   truth of God is precious in his sight, and it ought also to be precious
   unto us, although it be unto the reprobate the savor of death unto
   death, (2 Corinthians 2:16.)

   But now I return unto Stephen's accusation, the principal point whereof
   is this, that he blasphemed God and Moses. They do, for good
   considerations, make the injury common to God and to Moses, because
   Moses had nothing in his doctrine which was his own or separated from
   God. They prove this, because he spake blasphemously against the temple
   and the law; furthermore, they make this the blasphemy, because he said
   that the coming of Christ had made an end of the temple and the
   ceremonies. It is not credible that Stephen spake thus as they report;
   but they maliciously wrest those things which were spoken well and
   godly, that they may color their false accusation; but although they
   had changed nothing in the words, yet Stephen was so far from doing any
   injury to the law and the temple, that he could no way better and more
   truly praise the same. The Jews did suppose that the temple was quite
   dishonored, unless the shadowy estate thereof should endure for ever,
   that the law of Moses was frustrate and nothing worth, unless the
   ceremonies should be continually in force. But the excellency of the
   temple and the profit of the ceremonies consist rather in this, whilst
   that they are referred unto Christ as unto their principal pattern.
   Therefore, howsoever the accusation hath some color, yet is it unjust
   and wicked. And although the fact come in question, that is, whether
   the matter be so as the adversaries lay to his charge, notwithstanding
   the state [of the question] is properly [one] of quality, for they
   accuse Stephen, because he taught that the form of the worship of God
   which was then used should be changed; and they interpret this to be
   blasphemy against God and Moses; therefore the controversy is rather
   concerning right (as they say) than the fact itself; for the question
   is, Whether he be injurious and wicked against God and Moses, who
   saith, that the visible temple is an image of a more excellent
   sanctuary, wherein dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead, and who
   teacheth that the shadows of the law are temporal?

   This Jesus of Nazareth. They speak thus of Christ disdainfully, as if
   the remembrance of him were detestable. Nevertheless, it may be
   gathered out of their accusations, that Stephen did, in the abrogating
   of the law, set the body against the shadows, and the substance against
   the figure; for if ceremonies be abolished by Christ, their truth is
   spiritual. The Jews, which would have them continue for ever, did
   consider nothing in them but that which was gross, carnal, earthly, and
   which might be seen with the eyes. Briefly, if the use of ceremonies
   were continual, they should be frail and should vanish away, because
   they should have nothing but the only external show, so that they
   should have no soundness. Therefore, this is their true perpetuity,
   when as they are abrogated by the coming of Christ; because it
   followeth hereupon that the force and effect thereof doth consist in
   Christ.

   Shall change the ordinances. It is out of all doubt that Stephen meant
   this of the ceremonial part only; but because men are wont to be more
   addicted to external pomp, these men understand that which was spoken,
   as if Stephen would bring the whole law to nothing. The principal
   precepts of the law did indeed concern the spiritual worship of God,
   faith, justice, and judgment; but because these men make more account
   of the external rites, they call the rites which are commanded
   concerning the sacrifices, ordinances of Moses, by excellency. This was
   bred by the bone from the beginning of the world, and it will never out
   of the flesh so long as it lasteth. [363] As at this day the Papists
   acknowledge no worship of God save only in their visors; although they
   differ much from the Jews, because they follow nothing but the
   frivolous invention of men for the ordinances of God.

   15. And when they had beheld. Men do commonly in places of judgment
   turn their eyes toward the party arraigned, when as they look for his
   defense. He saith that Stephen appeared like to an angel; this is not
   spoken of his natural face, but rather of his present countenance. For
   whereas the countenance of those which are arraigned useth commonly to
   be pale, whereas they stammer in their speech, and show other signs of
   fear, Luke teacheth that there was no such thing in Stephen, but that
   there appeared rather in him a certain majesty. For the Scripture useth
   sometimes to borrow a similitude of angels in this sense; as 1 Samuel
   24:9; 2 Samuel 14:17; 2 Samuel 19:27

   CHAPTER 7
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 7:1-4

   1. And the chief priest said, Are these things so? 2. He answered, Men,
   brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared to our father
   Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, 3. And
   he said unto him, Come out of thy country, and from amongst thy
   kindred, and come into the land which I will show thee. 4. Then he came
   out of the land of the Chaldees, and dwelt in Charran. After that his
   father was dead, God brought him thence into this land, wherein ye now
   dwell.


   1. There appeareth as yet some color of equity in the high priest and
   in the council; and yet, notwithstanding, there is a most unjust
   prejudice in his words; for he asketh him not what cause he had to
   teach thus, neither doth he admit him unto the defense of right, (which
   was, notwithstanding, the chief;) but he demanded precisely whether
   Stephen uttered these words, whatsoever they were; as the Papists at
   this day will not demand what doctrine it is, and whether it can be
   proved out of the Scriptures; but they inquire [364] whether any man
   durst mutter against their superstitions, that so soon as he is
   convict, they may forthwith burn [365] him. Furthermore, Stephen's
   answer may seem at the first blush absurd and foolish. He beginneth
   first at the very first beginning; afterwards he maketh a long
   narration, wherein there is no mention made, in a manner, of the matter
   in hand; and there can be no greater fault than to utter many words
   which are nothing appertinent unto the matter; [366] but whosoever
   shall thoroughly consider this long speech, he shall find nothing
   therein which is superfluous; and shall full well perceive that Stephen
   speaketh very ap-pertinently, [367] as the matter requireth. He was
   accused as an apostate (or revolt,) which did attempt the overthrow of
   religion and the worship of God; therefore, he beateth in [368] this
   diligently, that he retaineth that God which the fathers have always
   worshipped, so that he turneth away the crime of wicked backsliding;
   [369] and declareth that his enemies were pricked forward with nothing
   less than with the zeal of the law, for they bear a show that they were
   wholly determined [370] to increase the glory of God; therefore, he
   wringeth from them this false boasting, and because they had the
   fathers always in their mouths, because they were puffed up with the
   glory of their nation, Stephen declareth also that they have no cause
   to be proud of this, but rather that the corruptions of the fathers
   were so great and so many, that they ought to be ashamed and humbled.

   As concerning the principal state of the cause, because the question
   was concerning the temple and the ceremonies, he affirmeth plainly that
   their fathers were elected of God to be a peculiar people before there
   was any temple, and before Moses was born; and to this end tendeth that
   exordium or beginning which is so far fet, (fetched.) Secondly, he
   telleth them that all external rites which God gave by the hand of
   Moses were fashioned according to the heavenly pattern.

   Whereupon it followeth, that the ceremonial law is referred unto
   another end, and that those deal foolishly and disorderly who omit the
   truth, and stay only in the signs. If the readers shall refer the whole
   oration of Stephen unto these points, they shall find nothing therein
   which agreeth not very well with the cause, as I shall declare again
   briefly in the end; nevertheless, that scope of the whole oration shall
   not hinder but that we may discuss all things briefly which are worth
   the noting.

   2. Men, brethren, and fathers. Although Stephen saw that those which
   sat in the council were, for the most part, the sworn enemies of
   Christ, yet because the ordinary government of the people did belong to
   them, and they had the oversight of the Church, which God had not as
   yet cast off, therefore, he is not afraid, for modesty's sake, to call
   them fathers. Neither doth he flatteringly purchase favor hereby; but
   he giveth this honor to the order and government appointed by God,
   until such time as the authority should be taken from them, the order
   being altered. Nevertheless, the reverence of the place which they had
   doth not hinder him nor stop his mouth; but that he doth freely dissent
   from them, whereby it appeareth how ridiculous the Papists are who will
   have us so tied unto bare and vain invented titles, that they may
   enforce us to subscribe unto their decrees, though they be never so
   wicked.

   The God of glory. By this beginning, he declareth that he doth not
   disagree or dissent from the fathers in true religion which they
   followed; for all religion, the worship of God, the doctrine of the
   law, all prophecies, did depend upon that covenant which God made with
   Abraham; therefore, when Stephen confessed that God appeared to
   Abraham, he embraceth the law and the prophets, which flow from that
   first revelation as from a fountain; moreover, he calleth him the God
   of glory, that he may distinguish him from the false and reigned gods,
   who alone is worthy of glory.

   When he was in Mesopotamia. It is well known that that is called by
   this name which lieth between the river Tigris and Euphrates; and he
   saith before, he dwelt in Charran, because Abraham, being warned by an
   oracle, fled [371] from Chaldea to Charran, which is a city of
   Mesopotamia, famous by reason of the slaughter of Crassus and the Roman
   army; although Pliny saith that it was a city of Arabia; and it is no
   marvel that Chaldea is in this place comprehended under the name of
   Mesopotamia, because, although that region, which is enclosed with
   Tigris and Euphrates, [Mesopotamia,] be properly the country between
   two rivers, yet those which set down any description of countries [372]
   do call both Assyria and Chaldea by this name.

   The sum is this, that Abraham being commanded by God, did forsake his
   country, and so he was prevented with the mere goodness of God when as
   he sought that which was offered him at home of the [its] own accord.
   Read the last chapter of Joshua; but it seemeth that Moses' narration
   doth somewhat disagree with this, for after that, about the end of the
   11th chapter of Genesis, he had declared, that Abraham doth [did] go
   into another country to dwell, having left his house, he addeth, in the
   beginning of the 12th, that God spake unto Abraham. This is easily
   answered, for Moses reciteth not in this latter place what happened
   after the departure of Abraham; but lest any man should think that
   Abraham wandered into other countries, having unadvisedly forsaken his
   own house, (as light and indiscreet men [373] used to do sometimes,) he
   showeth the cause of his departure, to wit, because he was commanded by
   God to flit into another place. And thus much do the words of the
   oracle import. For, if he had been a stranger in another country, God
   could not have commanded him to depart out of his native soil,
   forsaking his kinsmen and father's house. Therefore, we see that this
   place agreeth wondrous well with the words of Moses. For after that
   Moses hath said that Abraham went to Charran, to the end he may show
   that this journey was taken in hand, not through any lightness of man,
   but at the commandment of God, he addeth that afterwards which he had
   before omitted, which manner of speaking is much used of the Hebrews.

   3. Come out of thy country. God useth many words, to the end he may the
   more wound the mind of Abraham, as if it were not a thing sharp enough
   of itself to be banished out of his own country. And that served to try
   his faith; even as that other thing also, that God assigneth him no
   land wherein he may dwell, but maketh him stand in doubt, and wait for
   a time. Wherefore the obedience of Abraham was so much the more to be
   commended, because the sweetness of his native soil keepeth him not
   back from going willingly, as it were, into exile; and in that he
   doubteth not to follow God, although there appear no certain
   resting-place, but is commanded to wander to and fro for a time.
   Whereas, the showing of the land is deferred, it differeth not much
   from deceiving of him. [374]

   Furthermore, we learn continually by our own experience how profitable
   it was for Abraham thus to be exercised, and, as it were, trained by
   little and little. Many men are carried with a godly affection to
   attempt great things, but by and by, so soon as their heat is waxen
   cold, it repenteth them of their purpose, and they would gladly slip
   their necks out of the collar. [375] Therefore, lest Abraham should
   faint when he was in the midst of his course, through the remembrance
   of those things which he had left behind him, God sifteth and trieth
   his mind thoroughly, immediately after he had begun, lest he take
   anything in hand lightly and unadvisedly. To this purpose serveth the
   parable which Christ setteth before us concerning the building of the
   tower, (Luke 14:28.) For he teacheth that we must first cast the
   charges, lest with shame we be enforced to leave off building after we
   have begun. And though this were a particular thing in Abraham in that
   he was commanded to go out of his own country, and to go into a far
   country, in that God carried him from place to place, yet,
   notwithstanding, there is in these words some figure of the calling of
   us all. We are not all simply commanded to forsake our country, but we
   are commanded to deny ourselves; we are not commanded to come out of
   our father's house, but to bid adieu to our own will, and to the
   desires of our own flesh. Again, if father and mother, wife and
   children, hinder us from following God, we must forsake them all. The
   commandment is given simply to Abraham to flit; but we are commanded to
   do the stone upon condition. For if in any place we cannot serve God,
   we must rather make choice of exile than to stay in our nest, being
   slothful and sluggish. Therefore, let us have the example of Abraham
   always before our eyes. He is the father of the faithful, he was tried
   all manner of ways. Doth he forget his country, his friends, and
   himself, that he may give over himself unto God? (Romans 4:16,17.) If
   we will be counted the children of God, we must not degenerate from
   him.

   Which I shall show thee. We must note that which I touched a little
   before, that Abraham is kept in doubt, to the end his patience may be
   tried. And this must we also apply to our own use, that we may learn to
   depend wholly upon God. And surely this is a principal exercise of our
   faith to put our trust in God, even when we see nothing. God, indeed,
   will oftentimes show us a land wherein he granteth us an abiding-place;
   yet, notwithstanding, because we are strangers in the world, we have no
   certain and continual place of abode anywhere. Again, our life, as Paul
   saith, is hid, (Colossians 3:3;) and being like unto dead men, we hope
   for salvation, which is hid in heaven. Therefore, as touching our
   perpetual habitation, God doth cause us to depend upon his providence
   alone, when he commandeth us, as it were, to wander in a strange
   country. Lest such deferring discourage us, we must hold this general
   rule of faith, that we must go whither God calleth us, howsoever he do
   not show that which he promiseth.

   4. Then going out. The readiness and willingness of faith is commended
   in these words. For when he is called he maketh no delay, but maketh
   haste [376] and subdueth all his affections, that they may obey the
   holy commandment of God. It is uncertain for what cause he stayed at
   Charran; yet it may be that the weakness of his father caused him to
   tarry there, who, as we read, died there shortly after; or else,
   because he durst go no further, until such time as the Lord had told
   him whither he should go. It is more like to be true in mine opinion,
   that he was stayed there a while with the wearisomeness and sickness of
   his father, because Stephen saith plainly that he was brought thence
   after the death of his father.

   Acts 7: 5-8

   5. And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not the breadth of a
   foot; and promised that he would give it to him to possess, and to his
   seed after him, when as he had no son. 6. And God spake after this
   manner, Thy seed shall sojourn in a strange land; and they shall bring
   it into bondage, and shall evil entreat it four hundred years. 7. But
   the nation whom they shall serve will I judge, said God. And afterwards
   they shall come out, and shall worship me in this place. 8. And he gave
   him the covenant of circumcision: and so he begat Isaac, and
   circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
   the twelve patriarchs.


   5. We must note three firings in this place; that God exercised the
   patience of his servant, because, after that he had brought him out of
   his own country, he dwelt in the land of Canaan as a stranger.

   [First,] For Abraham possessed not one foot's-breadth, save only that
   which he bought to bury in. And that is counted no possession which
   serveth not for the uses of this life. Secondly, forasmuch as that
   field was bought, Stephen doth for good causes say, that God gave
   Abraham nothing. For that could not be gotten either with money, or by
   any other means which man could invent, which Abraham did hope for of
   the promise.

   Secondly, we must note, that though God did not show Abraham the thing
   itself as yet, yet did he uphold him by his word. And this is our stay,
   when God promiseth that that is laid up for us which as yet we possess
   not. Therefore, when as the thing, that is, the possession of the land,
   was wanting, Abraham had for his help and stay the promise of God; and
   being content with the same alone, he desired nothing in the land of
   Canaan save only an uncertain resting-place wherein he might sojourn.

   For as much as [epangellesthai] signifieth simply to promise, I thought
   there was no cause why, with Erasmus, I should translate it in this
   place, to promise again. For I resolve it adversatively, although he
   had promised, that by the way we may note as it were, a show of
   deceiving, [377] unless peradventure some man be disposed to apply it
   unto the promises which are oftentimes repeated. [378]

   Thirdly, we must note that the promise was such that it did not much
   differ from a mere mock. God promised the land to the seed of Abraham
   when he was fourscore years old, and had to wife one that was barren,
   neither had he any hope to have any issue. This seemeth to be more than
   frivolous. For why doth he not rather promise that he will give him
   seed? But this was a notable trial of faith, in that Abraham, without
   asking any question, or any curious disputation, did obediently and
   meekly embrace that which he had heard proceed out of the mouth of the
   Lord. Therefore, let us remember that God doth so lift up and comfort
   his servant with his word, that he doth not only defer the giving of
   the thing, [379] but also he may seem after a sort to mock him; as he
   dealeth with us also in some respect. For, although he call us the
   heirs of the world, (James 2:5,) he suffereth us oftentimes to want
   even a competent living and necessary helps. And this doth he of set
   purpose, that he may bring the wisdom of the flesh to nought, seeing
   that we do not otherwise give due honor to his word.

   6. Thy seed shall be a stranger. Stephen putteth the Jews in mind in
   how miserable and reproachful an estate their fathers were in Egypt;
   and showeth that this their servitude, wherewith they were oppressed,
   came not by chance; because it was foretold long before by the oracle
   of God. This history ought to have been of great force, partly to tame
   their lofty courages, [380] and to teach them modesty; partly to set
   forth the grace of God, because God had always had a care of that
   nation. For this is a singular benefit, in that the people are restored
   wonderfully, as it were, from death to life. In the mean season, the
   Jews are taught that the Church of God was elsewhere than in the land
   wherein they dwelt; that the fathers were chosen to be a peculiar
   people, and that they were kept safe under the tuition of God, before
   ever the temple was built, or the external ceremonies of the law were
   instituted.

   These things appertain unto the general scope or drift of the sermon.
   But hence may we gather a profitable admonition. Bondage is of itself
   hard and bitter; but when cruelty of masters is added thereunto, it
   seemeth to be intolerable. Wherefore, it must needs be that the mind of
   the godly man was sore wounded, when he heard that his seed should
   serve, and be villanously and cruelly entreated, Moreover, this was no
   small trial; forasmuch as these things were, to look to contrary--the
   inheritance of the land of Canaan which was now promised, and bondage
   in a strange country. For who would not have thought that God had, as
   it were, forgotten his former promise, when as he telleth Abraham that
   his seed shall endure miserable bondage? He saith, at the first, that
   he will give his seed the land. But he had as yet no seed; yea, all
   hope of seed was now cut off. But when doth he promise that he will
   give it? After his death. By and by he saith, that that seed should be
   carried away to another place, that it may serve strangers. And how
   long? Four hundred years. Doth he not seem, by this means, to pull back
   his hand, that he may not perform that which he had promised?

   Let us know that this was done, (not once only,) for God dealeth
   oftentimes with us thus, so that he may seem contrary to himself; and
   he speaketh also in such sort as that he may seem to call back [381]
   that which he had promised. Therefore, it cannot be but that flesh will
   judge that he is contrary to himself; but faith doth know that his
   words do agree well together amongst themselves, and with his works.
   And this is the purpose of God, to the end he may extend the sight of
   our faith the farther, to show his promises afar off, as it were, a
   long place [space] being put between. Therefore it is our duty to go
   forward, and to strive to attain unto that salvation which is set
   before us through many straits, [382] through divers lets, through long
   distance, through the midst of deeps, and, finally, through death
   itself. Furthermore, seeing that we see that the people which God had
   chosen did serve the Egyptians, and was uncourteously [383] afflicted,
   we must not be discouraged if the like condition be prepared for us at
   this day. For it is no new thing, neither any unwonted thing, for the
   Church of God to lie oppressed under tyranny, and to be, as it were,
   trodden under foot of the wicked.

   7. The nation whom they shall serve. This judgment is joined with the
   deliverance of the people. For, whereas God doth punish the cruelty and
   tyranny of the wicked Egyptians, he doth that for his people's sake,
   whom he took into his tuition, that it may be seen that he is the
   deliverer of his Church. Therefore, so often as we are unjustly
   afflicted by the wicked, let us remember that God is the Judge of the
   world, who will let no injuries be unpunished. Let every man thus think
   with himself, Seeing that I am under the tuition of God, who is the
   Judge of the world, and to whom it belongeth to punish all injuries,
   those shall not escape his hand who trouble me now. There is the like
   place in Deuteronomy 32:43, where God saith that vengeance is his.
   Whence Paul gathereth that we must give place to wrath, (Romans 12:19;)
   as if he should say, that this ought to serve to reform impatience, and
   to bridle our evil affections, in that God promiseth that he will
   revenge; for he which revengeth himself doth take God's office from
   him. And let us still remember that which I have already said, that God
   is touched with an especial care to revenge injuries done to his
   children, as it is in the Psalm, "Hurt not mine anointed, and be not
   troublesome to my prophets."

   They shall come thence and serve me. Therefore their deliverance went
   before the temple and the worship of the law; whereupon it followeth,
   that the grace of God was not tied to ceremonies. Nevertheless, Stephen
   noteth the end of their deliverance, that God chose both a peculiar
   people and a peculiar place for the true worship of his name. Whence we
   gather again, that we must regard what he commandeth and alloweth.
   Other nations also were determined to worship God; but because their
   rites were corrupt and bastardly, [384] God doth separate the Jews from
   the rest, and assigneth them a place where he will have them to worship
   him sincerely and duly as they ought. This place teacheth us, that
   God's benefits must be referred to this end, that men might be brought
   to addict and give over themselves wholly to him. Now, since that God
   hath dispersed the treasures of his grace throughout the whole world,
   we must endeavor to sanctify him, by worshipping him purely and holily,
   in what country soever we dwell.

   8. He gave him the covenant. When as he confesseth that circumcision is
   the covenant of God, he cleareth himself sufficiently of that crime
   which was laid to his charge; but, in the mean season, he showeth that
   the Jews deal amiss, if they place the beginning of their salvation in
   the external sign. For if Abraham was called, and the land and
   redemption promised to his seed before such time as he was circumcised,
   it appeareth that the glory of the whole stock cloth not depend upon
   circumcision. Paul useth the same argument in the 4th chapter to the
   Romans, (Romans 4:11.) For, seeing that Abraham obtained righteousness,
   and pleased God before he was circumcised, he gathereth thence that
   circumcision is not the cause of righteousness. Therefore we see that
   Stephen frameth no vain and idle narration; because this was very much
   appertinent unto the cause, that the Jews might remember how God had
   adopted them with their fathers, and it is to be thought that Stephen
   did plainly express both things; that although circumcision was given
   by God, that it might be a sign of grace, yet was the adoption before
   it both in order and in time. But we have no need to dispute any longer
   in this place concerning the nature and force of circumcision. Only let
   us note this, that God doth first promise those things to Abraham which
   he confirmeth afterward by circumcision, that we may know that the
   signs are vain and nothing worth, unless the word go before. Let us
   also note, that there is a profitable doctrine contained in the word
   covenant, to wit, that God maketh his covenant with us in the
   sacraments, that he may declare his love toward us; which thing, if it
   be true, first, they are not only works of external profession amongst
   men, but they gave great force inwardly before God, to confirm the
   faith. Secondly, they are no vain figures; because God, who is true
   figureth nothing there which he doth not perform.

   Acts 7:9-16

   9. And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt.
   Notwithstanding, God was with him; 10. And he delivered him out of all
   his afflictions: and he gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of
   Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt, and over all his
   house. 11. And there came a famine upon all the land of Egypt and
   Canaan, and great affliction; neither did our fathers find food. 12.
   And when Jacob had heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent our
   fathers thither first. 13. And at the second coming Joseph was known of
   his brethren; and the kindred of Joseph was made known to Pharaoh. 14.
   Then Joseph sent, and called out his father Jacob and all his kindred,
   seventy-five souls. 15. And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died,
   and our fathers; 16. And they were carried into Sychem, and they were
   laid in the sepulcher which Abraham had bought for money of the sons of
   Hemor, the son [father] of Sychem.


   9. Now followeth the greatest wickedness of the nation of Israel, that
   they conspired [385] together to oppress their innocent brother, which
   cruelty is contrary [386] to nature. Neither could the Jews object that
   it was a private fault of a few; for the infamy reacheth unto all the
   people. Forasmuch as all the patriarchs, Benjamin excepted, had
   polluted themselves with that treachery; therefore in that Stephen
   vouchsafeth to give them an honorable name that redoundeth to the
   greater reproach of the nation. They boasted proudly of their fathers;
   he showeth what manner [of] persons the chief of them were; to wit,
   murderers of their brother, [387] so much as in them laid. For, besides
   that slavery was a kind of death, we know what they went about at the
   first and, secondly, what cruel punishments Joseph suffered, of all
   which his brethren were guilty. Hereby it appeareth that God was
   bountiful and merciful to those which were, as it were unwilling, and
   which did resist him. For him (who was about to be the author of health
   and help [388] ) would they have destroyed. Wherefore they did what
   they could to renounce all the benefits of God. So he will declare
   afterward that Moses was rejected when he was offered of God to be a
   redeemer. Therefore, the Jews have small cause to brag of the
   excellency of their kindred; but this alone remaineth for them, that,
   being ashamed, [389] they confess that whosoever they are, they have
   the same through the mere mercy of God, and that they consider that the
   law was given to set forth the same.

   God was with him. God was not so with him that he did always show forth
   his power in helping him. For that is no small thing which is said in
   the Psalm, (105:18,) "That the iron went through his soul." Surely, it
   must needs be that he was in great heaviness, [390] when, being
   destitute of all help, he suffered reproach also together with bonds
   and the punishment of an ungodly and wicked man; but God useth
   oftentimes to be present with his in such sort, that he lieth hid for a
   time. And the end was an evident [391] token of his presence, which
   Joseph saw not at the first. Furthermore, we ought to remember this
   every now and then, that Joseph was not delivered because he had called
   upon God in the [a] temple but afar off in Egypt.

   10. Stephen addeth the means, because God gave him favor in the sight
   of Pharaoh. God could have delivered him by some other means, but his
   counsel had respect unto a farther thing, that Joseph, being ruler of
   the kingdom, might entertain his father and all his family. In these
   two words, favor and wisdom, there is the figure hypalloge. For the
   wisdom wherewith Joseph was endued was the cause that he found favor;
   although I confess that they were two distinct benefits. For, though
   Joseph were a faithful interpreter of dreams, and did excel in divine
   wisdom, yet the proud tyrant would never have brought him to so great
   honor, unless God had bent the mind of Pharaoh unto a certain unwonted
   love; yet, notwithstanding, we must consider that order whereby God
   useth to bring him into favor. [392] Wisdom doth not only signify the
   gift of prophecy in interpreting dreams, but prudence in giving
   counsel; for Moses putteth in both. That which Stephen reporteth of one
   man in this place is extended unto all. For what aptness and readiness
   [393] soever is in men, it ought to be reckoned amongst the gifts of
   God, and that his special gifts. [394] And it is he that giveth good
   success as it pleaseth him, that his gifts may be profitable to that
   end for which it seemed good to him to give them. Therefore, although
   Joseph be made chief ruler of Egypt by Pharaoh, yet is he lifted up to
   so great honor properly by the hand of God. [395]

   11. There came a famine. Hereby it appeareth that the deliverance of
   Joseph was such a benefit as was common to all the family of Jacob.
   For, seeing the famine drew on, [396] Joseph was sent before in due
   time to provide sustenance to feed the hungry; as he himself doth
   acknowledge the wonderful counsel of God in that point. Nevertheless,
   the free goodness of God appeareth plainly in the person of Joseph,
   whilst that he is appointed to nourish and feed his brethren, who had
   sold him, and by that means sent him far away, and thought that he was
   gone away quite [397] out of the world. He putteth meat in their mouths
   who had thrown him into a pit, and had deprived him of the air and the
   common breath. Finally, he nourisheth and preserveth their life who
   were not afraid [398] to take from him his life. In the mean season,
   Stephen putteth the Jews in mind of this, that the patriarchs were
   enforced to depart out of that land which was given them for an
   heritage, and that they died in another place. Therefore, forasmuch as
   they were sojourners in it, they are at length banished out of the
   same. [399]

   14. Whereas he saith that Jacob came into Egypt with seventy-five
   souls, it agreeth not with the words of Moses; for Moses maketh mention
   of seventy only. Jerome thinketh that Luke setteth not down, word for
   word, those things which Stephen had spoken, or that he took this
   number out of the Greek translation of Moses, (Genesis 46:27,) either
   because he himself, being a proselyte, had not the knowledge of the
   Hebrew tongue, or because he would grant the Gentiles this, who used to
   read it thus. [400] Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the Greek
   interpreters set down this number of set purpose, or whether it crop
   [crept] in afterward through negligence, [mistake;] which (I mean the
   latter) might well be, forasmuch as the Grecians used to set down their
   numbers in letters. Augustine, in his 26th book of City of God, [De
   Civitate Dei,] thinketh that Joseph's nephews and kinsmen [401] are
   comprehended in this number; and so he thinketh that the words went
   down doth signify all that time which Jacob lived. But that conjecture
   can by no means be received. For, in the mean space, the other
   patriarchs also had many children born to them. This seemeth to me a
   thing like to be true, that the Seventy Interpreters did translate that
   truly which was in Moses. And we cannot say that they were deceived;
   forasmuch as [in] Deuteronomy 10, where this number is repeated, they
   agree with Moses, at least as that place was read without all doubt in
   the time of Jerome; for those copies which are printed at this day have
   it otherwise. Therefore, I think that this difference came through the
   error of the writers which wrote out the books. [402] And it was a
   matter of no such weight, for which Luke ought to have troubled the
   Gentiles which were accustomed with the Greek reading. And it may be
   that he himself did put down the true number; and that some man did
   correct the same amiss out of that place of Moses. For we know that
   those which had the New Testament in hand were ignorant of the Hebrew
   tongue, yet skillful in [403] the Greek,

   Therefore, to the end [that] the words of Stephen might agree with the
   place of Moses, it is to be thought that that false number which was
   found in the Greek translation of Genesis was by them put in also in
   this place; concerning which, if any man contend more stubbornly, let
   us suffer him to be wise without measure. Let us remember that it is
   not without cause that Paul doth forbid us to be too curious about
   genealogies. This, so small a number, is purposely expressed, to the
   end the power of God may the more plainly appear, in so great an
   enlarging of that kindred, which was of no long continuance. For such a
   small handful of men could not, by any human manner of engendering,
   grow to such an infinite multitude as is recorded in Exodus 12:37,
   within two hundred and fifty years. We ought rather to weigh the
   miracle which the Spirit commendeth unto us in this place, than to
   stand long about one letter, whereby the number is altered. There arise
   other questions (and those which are more hard to be answered) out of
   the rest of the text, [context.]

   16. Stephen saith, that the patriarchs were carried into the land of
   Canaan after they were dead. But Moses maketh mention only of the bones
   of Joseph, (Genesis 1:13.) And Joshua 24:32, it is reported, that the
   bones of Joseph were buried without making any mention of the rest.
   Some answer, that Moses speaketh of Joseph for honor's sake, because he
   had given express commandment concerning his bones, which we cannot
   read to have been done of the rest. And, surely, when Jerome, in the
   pilgrimage of Paula, saith, that she came by Shechem, he saith that she
   saw there the sepulchres of the twelve patriarchs; but in another place
   he maketh mention of Joseph's grave only. And it may be that there were
   empty tombs [404] erected to the rest. I can affirm nothing concerning
   this matter for a certainty, save only that this is either a speech
   wherein is synecdoche, or else that Luke rehearseth this not so much
   out of Moses, as according to the old fame; as the Jews had many things
   in times past from the fathers, which were delivered, as it were, from
   hand to hand. And whereas he saith afterward, they were laid in the
   sepulcher which Abraham had bought of the sons of Hemor, it is manifest
   that there is a fault [mistake] in the word Abraham. For Abraham had
   bought a double cave of Ephron the Hittite, (Genesis 23:9,) to bury his
   wife Sarah in; but Joseph was buried in another place, to wit, in the
   field which his father Jacob had bought of the sons of Hemor for an
   hundred lambs. Wherefore this place must be amended.

   Acts 7:17-19

   17. And when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to
   Abraham, the people increased, and was multiplied in Egypt, 18. Until
   another king arose, which knew not Joseph: 19. This man dealt subtilely
   with our kindred; he evil-entreated our fathers, that they might cast
   out their infants, lest they should be increased.


   17. Stephen passeth over unto the deliverance of the people, before
   which [405] went that innumerable issue which had increased beyond the
   ordinary manner in no long space of time. Therefore, he setteth down
   this as a singular gift of God, that the people was increased, to the
   end we may know that that came not to pass according to the common or
   wonted custom of nature. But, on the other side, God seemeth to take
   from the Jews all hope, because Pharaoh doth tyrannously afflict them,
   and their bondage groweth greater daily. And when as they are commanded
   to cast out their male infants, it seemeth that the destruction of the
   whole nation was present. There is another token of deliverance given,
   when Moses cometh abroad; but because he is by and by refused and
   enforced to fly into exile, there remaineth nothing but mere despair.
   The sum is this; that God, being mindful of his promise, did increase
   the people in time, that he might perform that which he had sworn to
   Abraham; but the Jews (as they were unthankful and froward) did refuse
   the grace of God, so that they did what they could to shut up the way
   before themselves. Furthermore, we must note the providence of God in
   this place, whilst that he doth so order the course of times, that his
   works have always their opportunity. But men who make haste disorderly
   in their desires cannot hope patiently, and be at rest, until such time
   as God showeth forth his hand; for this cause, because they take no
   heed to that moderation whereof I have spoken. And to the end God may
   exercise the faith of his children so often as he appeareth with joyful
   tokens of grace, he setteth other things against those on the other
   side, which cut off suddenly the hope of salvation. For who would not
   have said of the Hebrews, that they were utterly undone, when as the
   king's commandment appointed all the men children to be put to death?
   For which cause the meditating upon that doctrine is the most [more]
   necessary for us, that God doth kill and restore to life; he leadeth
   unto hell, and bringeth back again.

   19. Dealt subtilely. The old interpreter did not translate this amiss,
   to deceive. [406] For Stephen meaneth that the king of Egypt did
   craftily invent new shifts and wicked pretenses, that he might every
   now and then lay heavier burdens upon the people, like as almost all
   tyrants do; for how unjustly soever they vex their subjects, they are
   [but] too witty to invent excuses. And it is not to be doubted but that
   Pharaoh abused this honest color, that it was not meet that the Jews,
   who were sojourners, should have a place of abode in his realm for
   nought, and that they should be free from all burthens, seeing they did
   enjoy great commodities. Therefore, he deceitfully made them vile
   bondslaves of free-men. When Stephen saith that this tyrant knew not
   Joseph, hereby it appeareth how soon the remembrance of benefits
   passeth away among men, For although we do all with one consent detest
   unthankfulness, yet is there no vice more common amongst us.

   Lest they should be increased. Erasmus translateth this improperly, in
   my judgment. For [Zoogoneisthai] expresseth more than lest their
   children should live. For the word is fet [fetched] thence, because the
   people doth all always remain alive in the offspring. And, furthermore
   Stephen doth not reckon up all the parts of their evil-entreating, but
   putteth down one example of extreme cruelty. Whence we may easily
   gather how near the whole seed of Abraham was to destruction. For
   Pharaoh seemed to have murdered them all with that commandment as with
   one stroke of a sword. But such violent barbarism did the more set
   forth the unlooked-for and incredible power of God; because when
   Pharaoh hath, by all means possible, striven against God, yet all is in
   vain.

   Acts 7:20-29

   20. At that time was Moses born, who was acceptable to God And he was
   brought up three months in his father's house. 21. And the daughter of
   Pharaoh took him up when he was cast out, and nourished him up for her
   own son. 22. And Moses was taught in all wisdom of the Egyptians, and
   was mighty in word and deed. 23. And when the time of forty years was
   fulfilled, it came into his mind to go visit his brethren, the children
   of Israel. 24. And when he saw one of them suffer wrong, he defended
   him, and revenged him which had the wrong, having smitten the Egyptian.
   25. And he thought that his brethren would have understood that by his
   hand should give them deliverance; but they understood not. 26. The
   next day he was seen as they strove, and set them at one again, saying,
   Sirs, ye are brethren: why hurt ye one another? 27. And he which did
   injury to his neighbor thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a prince
   and a judge over us? 28. Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian
   yesterday? 29. And Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in
   the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.


   20. It is not without cause that Stephen noteth the circumstance of
   time. Moses was born at the very same time when the king had commanded
   that all the men children should be cast out. Therefore, it seemeth
   that the minister of deliverance is dead before he is born. But that
   time is most fit for God to work in, when there is no hope or counsel
   to be looked for at man's hands. And it appeareth also most plainly how
   God doth make perfect his power in man's weakness, (2 Corinthians
   41:9.) Moses is kept three months, but at length his parents (that they
   may save their own lives) are enforced to cast him out into the river.
   Only they put him into a little coffer, [407] that he may not by and by
   [immediately] perish. When as Pharaoh's daughter taketh him up, he
   escaped death indeed, yet so that he goeth into another nation, being
   cut off from the kindred of Israel. Yea, he was like to be a most
   troublesome adversary to his nation, unless God had restrained his
   mind. It is forty years before he showeth any token of brotherly
   good-will.

   22. Whereas Luke reporteth that he was taught in all wisdom of the
   Egyptians, he putteth that in his commendation as a point of
   excellency. Notwithstanding, it might have so fallen out, as it doth
   oftentimes, that being puffed up with profane sciences, he might have
   despised the base common people; yet because God had determined to
   redeem his people, he doth, in the mean season, frame both the mind of
   Moses and all other things to finish his work. The reason of man's
   flesh [408] should murmur in this place, Why doth God wink at so long
   miseries of the people? Why doth he suffer Pharaoh to rage more cruelly
   daily? Why doth he not suffer Moses to grow up amongst his own people?
   Why doth he after a sort cut him off from the kindred of Israel, being
   adopted by the king's daughter? Why will he suffer him to remain amidst
   courtly pleasures, [409] and doth not rather pull him thence? But the
   end itself is so wonderful, that we are enforced to confess that all
   these things were governed by singular counsel and order to set forth
   the glory of God.

   Whereas I said that Luke speaketh in this place of the learning of the
   Egyptians for honor's sake, I would not have it so taken as if there
   were in the same no corruption. Forasmuch as astrology [410] doth
   consider the wonderful workmanship of God, not only in the placing of
   the stars, and in such excellent variety, but also in their moving,
   force, and secret offices, it is a science both profitable and worthy
   of praise. The Egyptians bestowed great study in this, but being not
   content with the simple order of nature, they wandered also into many
   foolish speculations, as did the Chaldeans. It is uncertain whether
   Moses was infected with these superstitions or no. Yet, howsoever it
   be, we see how sincerely and plainly he setteth that before us to be
   considered in the frame of the world, which is appertinent unto
   godliness. Surely this was excellent modesty, in that he which could
   reason with learned and witty men of the secrets of nature, doth not
   only omit higher subtleties, but doth also descend unto the common
   capacity of every most simple man, and doth, in a common style, set
   forth unto men unlearned those things which they perceive by
   experience. When Justinian [Justin] babbleth concerning Moses, he
   maketh him a magician, which, with juggling and enchantments, made
   passage for the people through the Red Sea; so that Satan did not only
   go about to bury the power of God, but also to blaspheme the same. But
   we know that Moses did not strive with the enchanters by magic, but did
   that only which God had enjoined him.

   Furthermore, the Egyptians had mystical divinity, wherewith they
   colored their doting inventions and monstrous abominations, as if they
   would prove that they went mad not without reason: as the Papists,
   whereas they delude and mock men like stage-players, in their mass and
   other foolish rites, yet they invent mysteries, that they may persuade
   men that there is nothing there but that which is divine. The common
   sort of priests cannot climb so high, but those which amongst them will
   be accounted more cunning [411] do omit no rite, how foolish and
   childish soever it be, affirming that there is some spiritual mystery
   in every [one] of them. There is extant concerning this matter a most
   foolish mingle-mangle, which they call the Rationall [Rationale] of
   Divine Offices. But forasmuch as sacrificing priests alone did use such
   dotings amongst themselves, it is not to be thought that Moses spent
   any time in these, whose bringing up was princely, but that he was
   taught in liberal arts.

   He was mighty. This phrase doth express among the Hebrews a double
   excellency, when as he which doth excel in wit and learning, is also
   apt to attempt and bring to pass great and weighty matters. [412]
   Stephen's meaning is, therefore, that Moses was furnished with rare
   gifts, so that they did all confess that he was a singular man. But
   seeing he was in such estimation, the Israelites had the less hope that
   he should be the minister which should work their deliverance.

   23. When the time was fulfilled. Many gather by this that Moses was
   never estranged in mind from his nation; but the words of Stephen
   incline rather toward the contrary, to wit, that the Spirit of God did
   at length awake his mind, as it were out of sleep, that he might at
   length go visit his brethren, whom he had long time neglected. It is to
   be thought that he was not ignorant of what stock he came, seeing he
   had some token thereof in his flesh, and seeing the rumor thereof was
   spread abroad in the court, because the king's daughter could not adopt
   him to be her son without some suspicion of wickedness, unless his
   kindred had been known; yet was it long before he was of such courage
   that he durst make known the love which he bare toward his kindred. And
   this serveth not a little to set forth the glory of God, that Moses,
   being ignorant of his calling, doth remain a long time idle in the
   king's court, and is afterward called of the Lord contrary to the hope
   of all men, and his own also. Therefore, this new care for his brethren
   which came into his mind, proceeded from a new and unwonted motion of
   God's Spirit.

   24. When he saw a certain man. Moses came not to this spectacle by
   chance, but forasmuch as God had appointed him to be the deliverer of
   his people, he would have him show forth this token, and, as it were,
   make this beginning. For Stephen doth plainly express that he did
   attempt nothing unadvisedly, but did that which became him that was
   appointed to be a deliverer of the people, knowing that he was
   thereunto called. For unless God had armed him, (and made him
   puissant,) it had been a thing altogether unlawful for him to kill any
   man, how wicked soever he had been. It is a godly deed, and
   praiseworthy, for a man to set himself against the wicked, to defend
   the good against the injuries of the wicked, to bridle their violence;
   but it is not for a private person to punish, (or take vengeance.)
   Therefore, it was unlawful for Moses to slay the Egyptian, save only
   inasmuch as the Lord had put the sword in his hand according to the
   right of his calling. But this heroical courage and nobleness of heart
   [413] was a work of the Holy Ghost; because God doth mightily show
   forth his power in those whom he appointeth unto great matters, that
   they may be able to fulfill their function. In sum, Stephen meaneth
   that Moses was even then offered to be the minister of deliverance when
   the day was at hand, according to the covenant made with Abraham, yet
   did the people hope for nothing less.

   26. The day following he appeared. Stephen declareth now that the
   fathers did not only neglect, but maliciously reject the grace of God.
   For although the evil which he mentioneth did proceed from one man
   only, yet doth he by right assign the fault unto them all. For if they
   had been thankful to God, they would all with one consent have
   repressed his forwardness. [414] But they are whisht, [415] and suffer
   that good turn which Moses had done to be upbraided unto him; and, so
   much as in them lieth, they bring them into extreme danger whom they
   ought to have defended by endangering themselves. [416] Therefore, his
   drift is this, that the people themselves were in the fault, that they
   were no sooner delivered and eased. [417] So the wickedness of men doth
   oftentimes hinder God from doing that [which] he would do. He is ready
   to help those that be his in due time, but we keep back his hand from
   ourselves with divers lets, and afterwards we complain of his slowness,
   but unjustly. Furthermore, this unthankfulness was too wicked against
   God, and too cruel against Moses. They were to thank God for giving
   such a faithful patron in the king's court. They were to love and
   reverence Moses; but they rewarded him full evil [418] with
   threatenings and reproaches. Furthermore, inasmuch as the fact was
   brought to the king's ears, we must needs impute that to the treachery
   of the people. Therefore, as when afterward the people could see the
   land of Canaan, they did through their own folly keep themselves from
   entering in; so now, refusing the grace of God in the person of one
   man, they cause the time of their deliverance to be deferred forty
   years. For although God had determined what he would do, yet those are
   justly blamed for the delay which hinder [419] Moses in his office.

   Men ye are brethren. There is, indeed, amongst men a general
   conjunction, so that they ought to use great courtesy one toward
   another, and to abstain from all injuries; but this is more unmeet and
   intolerable, when those hurt one another who are nearer linked
   together. Therefore, Moses doth not only use a general reason, that it
   may revoke [420] their minds which were desirous to do harm, but he
   mentioneth their kindred and fellowship of blood to mollify their
   cruelty. Yet all in vain; for he which had done injury to his neighbor
   doth forwardly thrust him from him, and addeth thereunto threatening.
   And this is a common thing amongst men; for an evil conscience doth
   drive men into fury, and the worse every man's cause is, the more
   boldly and cruelly doth he extol himself. But under what color doth he
   which hath the worst cause set himself so stubbornly against Moses? He
   saith he is no judge; but he did not reprove them according to
   authority, but did only friendly admonish them. Is it the duty of a
   judge alone to admonish us when we do amiss? But this is a common vice,
   used of all stubborn and unruly persons, to give place to no
   admonitions, save only when they are enforced by violence and
   authority; yea, they are like frantic [phrenzied] men who rail upon
   [421] their physicians. For which cause we must be the more careful to
   bridle our lust, lest we run headlong with such blind fury against
   those which are desirous to cure our vices. Furthermore, we are taught
   by this example, that the servants of God cannot so do their duty in
   reproving such vices of men, but they shall suffer many injuries,
   offend many, and incur dangers; and chiefly when they do well, they
   shall surely hear evil. But they must swallow up the unworthiness of
   these evils, [422] that they may not therefore cease to do that which
   the Lord commanded them, and which he alloweth. [423] Moses is burdened
   here with a cruel false accusation that he usurpeth the authority of a
   ruler, and by this means they lay treason to his charge. Secondly, it
   is objected unto him reproachfully that he slew an Egyptian; both these
   were very odious. Whereby we may gather with how dangerous a temptation
   the mind of the holy man was stricken. And forasmuch as we see that he
   was neither discouraged by exile, neither by any other evils, so that
   it did not repent him of his well-doing, let us also learn by his
   example to bear a valiant and strong mind and courage against all such
   assaults of Satan,

   Acts 7:30-34

   30. And when forty years were expired, there appeared unto him in the
   desert of Mount Sinai the angel of the Lord, in a flame of fire in a
   bush. 31. And so soon as Moses saw it, he wondered at the vision.
   Furthermore, when he drew near to consider, the voice of the Lord came
   unto him, 32. I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, the God
   of Isaac, the God of Jacob; and Moses was afraid, and durst not draw
   near. 33. And the Lord said unto him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet;
   for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 34. In seeing, I
   have heard [seen] the affliction of my people in Egypt, and have heard
   their mourning, and I am come down to deliver them. And now come, I
   will send thee into Egypt.


   30. And when forty years were expired. As Moses was no blockish man,
   [424] every one of us may easily gather how many things might have come
   into his mind which might have caused him to mistrust his calling. The
   shifts and sleights of Satan are captious. We are more than bent
   naturally to distrustfulness; [425] what doubts soever arise in our
   minds concerning the word of God we do easily admit the same. It was a
   hard exchange to be thrust from earthly delights and a sumptuous life
   unto the painful and base office of feeding sheep; and especially
   forasmuch as Moses saw so much time spent, and being in the mean season
   sent into the wilderness, what other thing could he imagine with
   himself but that that was vain and a plain mock which the Lord had
   promised? Forasmuch as being now fourscore years of age, he was
   occupied about the feeding of his father-in-law's sheep, when could he
   have hoped that there should have been any use of him in delivering the
   people? It is good for us oftentimes to call to mind these combats of
   the godly until they be thoroughly imprinted in our memory, lest our
   minds faint, and our hearts fail us, if the Lord make us stay longer
   than we could wish. Again, Moses giveth a notable example of modesty,
   seeing that in all that time he attempteth nothing; he raiseth no
   tumults, neither intrudeth himself any way to bear rule, as troublesome
   men use to do; but employeth himself in his shepherd's function as
   diligently as if he should never have been called unto any greater
   charge. But whilst he tarrieth the Lord's leisure so patiently, he [the
   Lord] appeareth unto him at length.

   The angel of the Lord appeared unto him. It is first demanded who this
   angel was? and, secondly, why he appeared in such a form? For after
   that Luke had called him an angel, he bringeth him in immediately
   speaking thus: I am the God of Abraham, etc. Some answer, As God doth
   sometimes attribute and impart unto his ministers those things which
   are most proper to himself, so it is no absurd or inconvenient thing,
   if they have his name given them; but seeing this angel affirmeth
   manifestly that he is the eternal God, who alone is, and in whom all
   things have their being, we must needs restrain this title unto the
   essence of God; for it can by no means agree to the angels. It might be
   said more fitly, that because the angel speaketh in the name of the
   Lord, he taketh upon him his person, as if he declared his commandments
   word for word, as out of the mouth of God, which manner of speaking is
   usual in the prophets; but when Luke shall say afterwards, that this
   was the same angel through whose assistance and guiding Moses delivered
   the people: and Paul, in the 10th chapter of the First to the
   Corinthians, (1 Corinthians 10:4) doth affirm that Christ was that
   guide, there is no cause why we should now wonder that the angel taketh
   to himself that which is proper to God alone.

   Therefore, let us, first of all, set down this for a surety, that there
   was never since the beginning any communication between God and men,
   save only by Christ; for we have nothing to do with God, unless the
   Mediator be present to purchase his favor for us. Therefore, this place
   doth plentifully prove the divinity of Christ, and teacheth that he is
   of the same essence with the Father. Furthermore, he is called an
   angel, not only because he had the angels always to bear him company,
   and to be, as it were, his apparitors: [426] but because that
   deliverance of the people did shadow the redemption of us all, for
   whose sake Christ was to be sent of his Father, that he might take upon
   him the shape of a servant together with our flesh. It is certain,
   indeed, that God did never appear unto men as he is, but under some
   shape agreeable to their capacity; notwithstanding, there is another
   reason why Christ is called by this name, because he being appointed by
   the eternal counsel of God to be unto men the minister of salvation,
   doth appear unto Moses to this end. Neither is that contrary to this
   doctrine, which is written in the 2nd chapter to the Hebrews, (Hebrews
   2:16) that Christ never took the angels, but the seed of Abraham; for
   although he took upon him the shape of an angel for a time, yet did he
   never take the nature of angels, as we know that he was made very man.

   It resteth that we speak somewhat of the burning bush. That is common,
   that God doth apply the signs unto the things by a certain likelihood,
   and this is almost the common order and way of the sacraments.
   Furthermore, this was the fittest thing that could have been shown to
   Moses, to confirm his faith in the present business. He knew in what
   state he had left his nation. Although there were a greater [427]
   number of men, yet were they not unlike to a bush. For the thicker the
   bush is, and the more store of shrubs it hath, [428] the more subject
   is it to take fire, that it may burn on every side; so the people of
   Israel were but a weak band, and such as was laid open to all injuries;
   and this unwarlike multitude being pressed down even with their own
   weight, had incensed the cruelty of Pharaoh only with the prosperous
   success of increasing. Therefore, the people being oppressed with cruel
   tyranny, is, as it were, a pile of wood set on fire at every corner,
   neither is there any thing which keepeth it from being consumed to
   ashes, save this, because the Lord sitteth in the midst thereof; and
   although the [an] undoubted [429] fire of persecution did then burn,
   yet because the Church of God is never free from afflictions in the
   world, the continual estate thereof is after a sort painted out in this
   place. For what other thing are we but fuel for fire? And there fly
   abroad innumerable fire-brands of Satan continually, which set on fire
   both our bodies and also our minds; but the Lord delivereth and
   defendeth us, by his wonderful and singular goodness, from being
   consumed. Therefore, the fire must needs burn, that it may burn us in
   this life; but because the Lord dwelleth in the midst of us, he shall
   so preserve us that afflictions shall do us no harm, as it is also said
   in the 46th Psalm, (Psalm 46:5.)

   31. He wondered at the vision. Let us know that God did use thus to
   deal with our fathers, that they might assuredly know his majesty; for
   he meant to make a manifest distinction between the visions which he
   showed, and the juggling casts of Satan. And this certainty is more
   necessary, for what credit should the oracles of God otherwise carry,
   wherein the covenant of eternal life is contained? Therefore, forasmuch
   as this alone is the true stay of faith, to have God to be the author
   thereof, that he may [he must needs] undoubtedly declare that it is he
   that speaketh. Again, forasmuch as Satan walketh about continually, and
   doth by many and strange shifts insinuate himself, and hath so many
   ways to deceive, and especially seeing he doth pretend the name of God
   craftily, we must take great heed of his mocks. We see how in times
   past he deluded all nations, and [how he deludes] the Papists also. For
   all the monsters of superstitions, all the dotings of errors which were
   in times past, and do as yet reign in Popery, did proceed from dreams,
   visions, and false revelations; yea, furthermore, even the Anabaptists
   have their illusions thence. Therefore, this is the only remedy that
   God do distinguish by certain marks those visions which he showeth; for
   then are we without danger of erring, when he hath revealed his majesty
   unto us. For this cause was the mind of Moses stricken with admiration,
   and then afterwards he draweth near to consider; after that he is come
   nearer, the Lord toucheth him with a more lively feeling of [I confess
   indeed] his presence, so that he is afraid. For I confess that there
   are none of all these things which Satan cannot imitate, yet falsely
   like an ape. And the Lord doth not only show himself by such signs, but
   helping our dullness, he doth also open our eyes that we may not be
   deceived. Again, the Holy Ghost doth imprint in our minds certain marks
   and tokens of God's presence, that there may no doubt remain.

   32. I am the God of thy fathers. Now, we see to what end the vision was
   offered to Moses; to wit, that the word of God might have his [its]
   authority. For bare visions should do but little good, unless doctrine
   were joined therewithal; and it is joined with them not as an inferior
   part, but as the cause of all visions and the end. And whereas he
   calleth himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there is a double
   reason why he calleth himself so. As the majesty of God is infinite, if
   we will comprehend it, it doth rather swallow up our senses; if we
   endeavor to ascend unto it we vanish away; therefore, he adorneth
   himself with titles under which we may comprehend him. But we must mark
   that God maketh choice of such titles, as that he may by them call us
   back unto his word. For he is called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
   Jacob, for this cause, because he committed unto them the doctrine of
   salvation, that he might thereby be known to the world. But God had
   respect properly unto the present circumstance when he spake to Moses
   on this wise; for both this vision, and the hope of the delivery of the
   people, and the commandment which he was about to give to Moses, did
   depend upon the covenant which he had made in times past with the
   fathers. So that the suspicion of novelty is taken away, and the mind
   of Moses is lifted up to hope for redemption, which was grounded in the
   whole [430] promise.

   Therefore, this title is as much as if God had said, I, which have
   promised in times past to your fathers, that I have a care of your
   safety, which have taken the kindred of Abraham to my tuition by a free
   covenant, yea, which have appointed this time for an end of your
   bondage, I appear now unto thee, that I may perform that which I
   promised, like as at this day all the promises of God must lean and be
   stayed upon this foundation, that they may be sure and certain to us,
   that God hath adopted us in Christ, and hath promised that he will be
   our God and our Father. And Christ gathereth out of this place by good
   reason that the godly live after they be dead, (Matthew 22:32;) for if
   the whole man perish in death, this were an unfitting speech, [431] I
   am the God of Abraham. Let us suppose that there is no Rome, shall not
   he be laughed at which shall call himself consul of Rome? For this is
   requisite in relation, that the members be answerable between
   themselves. [432] There is also another reason to be considered, that
   forasmuch as God hath in his hand both life and death, without all
   doubt he preserveth those alive whose father he will be, and whom he
   counteth his children; therefore, though Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
   died, concerning the flesh, yet do they live in spirit with God.

   And Moses being afraid. This might seem to be an absurd thing, that a
   voice full of consolation doth rather terrify Moses than make him glad;
   but it was good for Moses to be thus terrified with the presence of
   God, that he might frame himself unto the greater reverence; neither
   doth the voice of God alone strike his mind, but his majesty, whereof
   he saw a sign in the burning bush. And what marvel is it, if man be
   afraid when he seeth God? and especially let us remember that men's
   minds are by this means prepared unto fear and reverence as in Exodus
   20:22,

   "Thou hast seen signs, thou hast heard the sound of the trumpet, that
   thou mayest learn to fear the Lord."

   But some will say, Why dare not Moses now for fear consider, who was
   not afraid to draw near before? I answer, that the nearer we draw unto
   God, the more his glory doth appear, so are we the more afraid, and
   that by right. And God maketh Moses afraid for none other cause, save
   only that he may make him obedient unto him. This fear was a
   preparation not unfit for greater boldness; and to this end tendeth
   that which followeth, Put off thy shoes from thy feet; for he is
   admonished by this sign with reverence to receive the commandments of
   God, and to give him due glory by all means.

   33. Because the place wherein. The Lord meant by this commendation
   which he giveth to the place, to lift up the mind of Moses into heaven,
   that he might not think upon any earthly thing. And if so be that Moses
   was to be pricked forward with so many pricks, that having forgotten
   the earth, he might hearken to God, must not we have our sides even, as
   it were, digged through, [433] seeing we are an hundred times more slow
   than he? Notwithstanding, here may a question be asked, how this place
   became so holy? for it was no more holy than other places before that
   day. I answer, that this honor is given to the presence of God, and not
   to the place, and that the holiness of the place is spoken of for man's
   sake. For if the presence of God do make the earth holy, how much more
   force thereof ought men to have? [434] Notwithstanding, we must also
   note, that the place was thus beautified only for a time, so that God
   did not fix his glory there, as Jacob erected an altar to God in
   Bethel, after that God had showed some token of his presence there,
   (Genesis 35:7.) When as his posterity did imitate the same afterward,
   it was such worship as was reproved. [435] Finally, the place is called
   holy for Moses' sake only, that he may the better address himself to
   fear God and to obey him. Forasmuch as God doth now show himself unto
   us everywhere in Christ, and that in no obscure figures, but in the
   full light and perfect truth, we must not only put off our shoes from
   our feet, but strip ourselves stark-naked of ourselves. [436]

   34. In seeing I have seen. God promiseth now that he will deliver his
   people, that he may appoint Moses to be his minister afresh, because
   the former objection was taken away by so long space of time. For God
   is said to see our miseries when he hath respect to us, and is careful
   for our safety; as he is said again to shut his eyes, and turn his
   back, when as he seemeth to set light by our cause. In like sort is he
   said to come down. He needeth not to move out of his place to help us,
   for his hand reacheth throughout the heaven and earth; but this is
   referred unto our understanding. For, seeing that he did not deliver
   his people from their affliction, he might seem that he was afar off,
   and was busied about some other thing in heaven. Now he saith that the
   Israelites shall perceive that he is nigh unto them. The sum tendeth to
   this end, that Moses knowing the will of God, may not doubt to follow
   him as a guide, and the more boldly to employ himself about the
   delivery of the people, which he knew was the work of God. For we must
   note that he saith that he heard the mourning of the people. For
   although he hath respect unto those which are in misery and unjustly
   oppressed, yet when we lay our mournings and complaints in his lap, he
   is especially moved to have mercy; although this word may be taken for
   those blind and confused complaints which are not directed unto God, as
   it is taken oftentimes elsewhere.

   Acts 7:35-37

   35. This Moses, whom they had denied, saying, Who made thee a ruler and
   judge? him, I say, hath God sent to be a ruler and a redeemer, in the
   hand of the angel which appeared unto him in the bush. 36. He brought
   them out, having showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in
   the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years. 37. This is Moses,
   which said unto the children of Israel, The Lord your God shall raise
   up unto you a Prophet, out of the midst of your brethren, like unto me;
   hear him.


   35. Stephen passeth over many things, because he maketh haste unto this
   stun, that the Jews may understand that the fathers were not delivered
   therefore, because they had deserved that with their godliness, but
   that this benefit was bestowed upon them, being altogether unworthy;
   and, secondly, that there is some more perfect thing to be hoped for of
   these beginnings. When Moses, being ordained of God to be their
   revenger and deliverer, was now in a readiness, they stopped the way
   before him; therefore God doth deliver them now, as it were against
   their will. That which is added touching miracles and wonders, serveth
   as well to the setting forth of the grace of God, as to make known the
   calling of Moses. It is surely a strange thing, that God doth vouchsafe
   to declare his power by divers wonders, for such an unthankful people's
   sake. But in the mean season, he bringeth his servant in credit.
   Therefore, whereas the Jews set less by him afterward, whereas they
   essay sometimes to drive him away by railing, whereas they scold
   sometimes, sometimes murmur, sometimes set upon him outrageously, they
   bewray thereby both their wickedness, and also their contempt of the
   grace of God. Their unthankfulness and ungodliness was so increased
   always, that God must needs have striven with wonderful patience with
   such a froward and stubborn people.

   A ruler and a deliverer. We must understand the contrarieties [437]
   which augment the fault. They would have obeyed Moses if a tyrant had
   appointed him to be a judge, but they contemn him proudly, and refuse
   him disdainfully, being appointed of God, and that to be a deliverer.
   Therefore, in despising him, they were wicked; and in rejecting grace,
   unthankful. And whereas Moses hath such an honorable title given him,
   God doth not so give and resign unto man that honor which is due to
   himself, that he loseth any whit of his authority thereby. For
   doubtless Moses was not called a redeemer or deliverer in any other
   respect save only because he was the minister of God. And by this means
   the glory of the whole work remaineth in the power of God wholly.
   Therefore let us learn that so often as men have the titles which
   belong to God given them, God himself is not despoiled of his honor;
   but because the work is done by their hands, they are by this means
   commended. To this end tendeth that which Stephen saith, that this
   charge was committed to Moses in the hand of the angel. For by this
   means Moses is made subject to Christ, that under his conduct and
   direction he may obey God. For hand is taken in this place not for
   ministry, but for principality. Wherefore, God did so use the service
   of Moses, that the power of Christ did surpass him, as he is even at
   this day the chief governor, in accomplishing the salvation of the
   Church; yea, he useth the ministry of men in that sort, that the force
   and effect dependeth upon him alone.

   37. A Prophet shall God raise up. Stephen endeavoreth undoubtedly to
   prove by these words that Christ is the end of the law; although he
   doth not express the same in plain words. And assuredly, (as we have
   already said,) Luke reciteth not word for word all those things which
   Stephen uttered; but it is sufficient for him to note the principal
   points of matters. Furthermore, we have said before in the third
   chapter, that this testimony is so applied to Christ, that
   notwithstanding it agreeth to the other prophets also. For after that
   Moses had forbidden the people to be carried to and fro with the wicked
   superstitions of the Gentiles, he showeth what ought to follow. There
   is no cause (saith he) why thou shouldst desire magicians and
   enchanters; for God will never suffer thee to want prophets to teach
   thee faithfully. And now it is certain that the ministry of the
   prophets was temporal, as was also the ministry of the law; until
   Christ should bring the full perfection of wisdom into the world.
   Therefore Stephen's speech tendeth to this end, that Moses doth not
   keep the people fast bound to himself alone when as he setteth before
   them and commendeth unto them another teacher. The prophets were
   indeed, interpreters of the law and all their doctrine was, as it were,
   an addition or appurtenance [438] of those things which were uttered by
   Moses; but forasmuch as this was also certain, that Christ should bring
   a more perfect kind of doctrine, because he should make an end of all
   the prophecies, it followeth, that he is made the chief; and that the
   principal mastership (that I may so call it) is his, lest the faith of
   the gospel should be doubtful. Now we know to what end Stephen
   intermingled Moses' testimony, to wit, that he may prove that the Jews
   did no less contemn him, (of whom they made boast with open mouth to be
   their only teachers) even now when he is dead, than they did in times
   past, whilst he lived, wickedly and frowardly reject him. For whosoever
   believeth Moses, he will not refuse to be the disciple of Christ, whose
   messenger and crier he was, (John 5:46.) For the rest [439] out of the
   third chapter.

   Acts 7:38-41

   38. This is he which was in the congregation in the wilderness, with
   the angel which had spoken unto him in mount Sinai, [or did speak to
   him in the mount,] and with our fathers; who received lively oracles,
   that he might give them to us: 39. Whom our fathers would not obey, but
   they refused him, and they turned back in their hearts into Egypt, 40.
   Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for we know not what
   is happened to this Moses which brought us out of the land of Egypt.
   41. And they made a calf in those days, and they offered sacrifice to
   the idol, and they rejoiced over the works of their own hands.


   38. Stephen proceedeth to set forth the frowardness [440] of the
   people, who though they were provoked [stirred up] with so many
   benefits of God, yet did they never cease maliciously to reject him. If
   they had been disobedient and unthankful to God before, yet this so
   wonderful a deliverance ought to have brought them into a better mind;
   but he declareth that they were always like themselves. It was meet
   that so many miracles should not only have stuck fast in their minds,
   but also have continued still before their eyes. But having forgotten
   all, they fly back suddenly unto the superstitions of Egypt. The
   memorial of their cruel servitude was yet fresh, which they had escaped
   by passing over the Red Sea; and yet they prefer those tyrants by whom
   they were more than cruelly handled, before their deliverer, This was,
   therefore, a heap of ungodliness most desperate, that their
   stubbornness could not be broken or overcome with so many benefits of
   God, but that they did always return unto their nature. This doth
   greatly augment the greatness of the offense, where Stephen saith that
   Moses was then with them in the wilderness. For besides that there
   appeareth here rare goodness and long-sufferance of the Lord, in
   bearing with them, they make themselves to be without all excuse,
   whilst that being beset on every side with so many straits, being
   brought into so great distress; having Moses to be their guide in their
   journey, and the faithful keeper of their life, they fall away
   nevertheless treacherously from God, Finally, it appeareth that they
   were like untamed beasts, whom God could not keep in obedience with so
   many bands. Therefore, inasmuch as Moses left not off to govern them
   even through the wilderness, under the conduct and aid of the angel, it
   is an easy matter to gather by this circumstance of time, how incurable
   and obstinate their frowardness was; as it was a point of monstrous
   rebellion, not to be humbled with miseries, [441] and even with the
   very sight of death.

   Whereas he saith, that Moses was with the angel and the fathers, there
   is a contrary respect. [442] He was present with the fathers, that he
   might be their guide according to the commandment of the Lord; he was
   with the angel as a minister. Whereupon it followeth that he was no
   private person to whom this injury was done, but it was done to the
   governance of God, when the people could be kept back, with the
   reverence of neither, from running headlong into wicked rebellion. We
   have already spoken of the angel. But the participle [lalountos] or
   which spake, hath a double meaning. For it may be understood either of
   the first vision, whereby Moses was called to redeem the people, or of
   that speech which God had with Moses, after they were come over the Red
   Sea. And because Christ declared both ways, that he was the author of
   their deliverance, it is no great matter whether we choose; yea, there
   is no let but that it may be extended unto both. For he which began to
   speak to Moses from the beginning, that he might send him into Egypt,
   did continue the tenor of his speech afterward, until the work was
   finished.

   Which received lively oracles. Erasmus translated it lively speech; but
   those which are expert in the Greek tongue, they shall know that I have
   more truly translated the words of Stephen. For there is greater
   majesty in Oracles than in Speech, I speak only of the word; for I know
   that whatsoever proceedeth out of the mouth of God, the same is an
   oracle. Moreover, he purchaseth authority for the doctrine of Moses in
   these words, because he uttereth nothing but that which proceeded from
   God, Whereupon it followeth, that they did not so much rebel against
   Moses as against God; whereby their stubbornness [443] is more
   discovered, And this is a general way to establish doctrine, when men
   teach nothing but that which is commanded them by God. For what man
   dare make Moses inferior to him, who (as the Spirit affirmeth) ought
   only to be believed for this cause, because he faithfully unfolded and
   delivered the doctrine which he had received of God? But some men may
   ask this question, Why he called the law a living speech? For this
   title seemeth to disagree much with the words of Paul, where he saith
   that the law is the ministry of death, and that it worketh death, and
   that it is the strength of sin, (1 Corinthians 3:7.) If you take lively
   speech for that which is effectual, and cannot be made frustrate by the
   contempt of men, there shall be no contrariety; but I interpret it as
   spoken actively, for that which maketh to live. [444] For seeing that
   the law is the perfect rule of godly and holy life, and it showeth the
   righteousness of God, it is counted, for good causes, the doctrine of
   life and salvation. And to this purpose serveth that solemn
   protestation of Moses, when he calleth heaven and earth to witness,
   that he hath set before them the way of death and life. In which sense
   the Lord himself complaineth, that his good law is broken, and his good
   commandments, whereof he had said, "He which shall do these things
   shall live in them," (Ezekiel 20) Therefore the law hath life in
   itself. Yet if any man had liefer take living for that which is full of
   efficacy and strength, I will not greatly stand in contention.

   And whereas it is called the ministry of death, that is accidental to
   it, because of the corrupt nature of man; for it doth not engender sin,
   but it findeth it in us. It offered life, but we, which are altogether
   corrupt, can have nothing but death by it. Therefore, it is deadly in
   respect of men alone. Though Stephen had respect unto a farther thing
   in this place; for he doth not only speak of the bare commandments, but
   comprehendeth all Moses' doctrine, wherein the free promises are
   included, and so consequently, Christ himself, who is the only life and
   health of men. We must remember with what men Stephen had to do. They
   were such as were preposterously zealous of the law, who stayed only in
   the dead and deadly letter of the law; and, in the mean season, they
   raged against Stephen, because he sought Christ in the law, who is,
   indeed, the soul thereof. Therefore, by touching their perverse
   ignorance glancingly, he giveth them to understand that there is some
   greater and some more excellent thing hidden in the law than they have
   hitherto known. For as they were carnal, and content with an outward
   show, they sought no spiritual thing in it, yea, they would not so much
   as suffer the same to be showed them.

   That he might give them to us. This serveth to refute the false
   accusation wherewith he was falsely burthened. For seeing he submitteth
   his neck to the yoke of the law, and professeth that he is one of
   Moses' scholars, he is far from discrediting him amongst others. Yea,
   rather he turneth back the fault which was laid to his charge upon
   those which were the authors of the slander. That was, as it were, a
   common reproach for all the people, because the fathers would not obey
   the law. And therewithal he telleth them that Moses was appointed to be
   a prophet, not only for his time, but that his authority might be in
   force with the posterity, even when he was dead. For it is not meet
   that the doctrine of God should be extinguished together with
   ministers, or that it should be taken away. For what is more unlikely
   [445] than that that should die whereby we have immortality? So must we
   think at this day. As the prophets and apostles spake unto the men of
   their time, so did they write unto us, and (that) the force of their
   doctrine is continual, because it hath rather God to be the author
   thereof than men. In the mean season, he teacheth that if any reject
   the word appointed for them, they reject the counsel of God.

   39. They refused, and were turned away. He saith that the fathers
   rejected Moses; and he showeth the cause also, because they gave
   themselves rather unto the superstitions of Egypt; which was horrible,
   and more than blind fury, to desire the customs and ordinances of
   Egypt, where they had suffered such grievous things of late. He saith
   that they were turned away into Egypt in their hearts; not that they
   desired to return thither, (bodily,) but because they returned in mind
   unto those corruptions, which they ought not so much as to have
   remembered without great detestation and hatred. It is true, indeed,
   that the Jews did once speak of returning; but Stephen toucheth not
   that history now. Furthermore, he doth rather express their
   stubbornness, when he saith that they were turned away. For after that
   they had taken the right way, having God for their guide and governor,
   they start aside suddenly, as if a stubborn unbroken horse, not obeying
   his rider, should frowardly run backward.

   40. Make us. Though the Jews be turned back divers ways, yet Stephen
   maketh choice of one notable example above all the rest, of their
   filthy and detestable treachery, to wit, when they made themselves a
   calf, that they might worship it instead of God. For there can no more
   filthy thing be invented [446] than this their unthankfulness. They
   confess that they were delivered out of Egypt; neither do they deny
   that this was done by the grace of God and the ministry of Moses; yet,
   notwithstanding, they reject the author of so great goodness, together
   with the minister. And under what color? They pretend they cannot tell
   what is become of Moses. But they know full well that he is in the
   mount. They saw him with their eyes when he went up thither, until such
   time as the Lord took him unto himself, by compassing him about with a
   cloud. Again, they know that Moses is absent for their health's sake,
   who had promised that he would return, and bring unto them the law
   which God should give. He bade them only be quiet a while. They raise
   mad uproars suddenly within a small time, and without any cause; yet to
   the end they may cover their madness with the color of some reason,
   they will have gods present with them, as if God had showed unto them
   no token of his presence hitherto; but his glory did appear daily in
   the cloud and pillar of fire. Therefore we see what haste they make to
   commit idolatry through wicked contempt of God, that I may, in the mean
   season, omit to declare how filthy and wicked their unthankfulness was,
   in that they had so soon forgotten those miracles which they ought to
   have remembered even until the end of the world. Therefore, by this one
   backsliding, it appeareth sufficiently what a stubborn and rebellious
   people they were.

   Moreover, it was more expedient for the cause which Stephen had in
   hand, to recite this history of their rebellion than the other. [447]
   For the people doth quite overthrow the worship of God; they refuse the
   doctrine of the law; they bring in a strange and profane religion. And
   this is a notable place, because it pointeth out the fountain from
   which all manner of superstitions did flow since the beginning, and
   especially what was the first beginning of making idols; to wit,
   because man, which is carnal, will, notwithstanding, have God present
   with him, according to the capacity of his flesh. This is the cause why
   men were so bold in all ages to make idols. [448] And God doth, indeed,
   apply [449] himself to our rudeness thus far, that he showeth himself
   visible, after a sort, under figures; for there were many signs under
   the law to testify his presence, And he cometh down unto us, even at
   this day, by baptism and the supper, and also by the external preaching
   of the word. But men offend two manner of ways in this; for, first,
   being not content with the means which God hath appointed, they boldly
   get to themselves new means. This is no small fault, because their
   fingers itch always to have new inventions without keeping any mean,
   and so they are not afraid to pass the bounds which God hath appointed
   them. But there can be no true image of God, save that which he
   appointed. Therefore, what images soever are reigned and invented by
   man besides his word, they are false and corrupt.

   There is also another vice no less intolerable, that as man's mind
   conceiveth nothing of God but that which is gross and earthly, so it
   translateth all tokens of God's presence unto the same grossness.
   Neither doth man delight in those idols only which he himself hath
   made, but also doth corrupt whatsoever God hath ordained, by wresting
   it unto a contrary end. God cometh down unto us, indeed, as I have
   already said, but to this end, that he may lift us up into heaven with
   him. But we, because we are wholly set upon the earth, will, in like
   sort, have him in the earth. By this means is his heavenly glory
   deformed, and that fulfilled altogether which the Israelites say here,
   Make us gods. For whosoever he be that doth not worship God
   spiritually, he maketh unto himself a new god; and yet if ye thoroughly
   weigh all things, the Israelites will not have a god made of set
   purpose by them, but they think rather that they have the true and
   eternal God under the shape of the golden calf. For they are ready to
   offer the appointed sacrifice, and they approve that with their consent
   which Aaron saith, that those are the gods by whom they were brought
   out of Egypt. But God pusseth not for those frivolous imaginations; but
   he complaineth that men put strange gods in his place, so soon as they
   depart even a very little from his word.

   41. And they made a calf. We may easily gather by that which goeth
   before, why they were more delighted in that figure than in any other.
   For although Egypt did swarm with innumerable idols, yet it is well
   known that they made the greatest account of an ox. And whence is it
   that they are so desirous to have an idol, save only because they were
   turned back into Egypt, as Stephen hath already said? We must note the
   speech when he saith that they offered sacrifice to the idol. Aaron
   commandeth the people to assemble themselves together to worship God;
   they come all together. Therefore they testify that they mean nothing
   less [any thing rather] than to defraud God of his worship, howsoever
   they translate the same unto the calf; yea, rather, they are determined
   to worship God in the image of the calf. But because they forsook the
   true God, by making an idol, whatsoever followeth afterward it is
   judged to be given to the idol, because God refuseth all wicked
   worshipping. For it is not meet to account that as bestowed upon him
   which he hath not commanded; and because he forbids them expressly to
   erect any visible image unto him, that is mere sacrilege whatsoever is
   done afterward in honor thereof.

   They rejoiced over the works. This speech is taken out of Isaiah, yet,
   out of the prophets, who, in like sort, upbraid unto the Jews that they
   were delighted in their own inventions. And surely it is wonderful
   madness, when men arrogate unto themselves anything in God's matters. I
   take this rejoicing to be that solemn dancing whereof Moses speaketh,
   in the thirty-second chapter of Exodus. Yet Stephen toucheth a common
   vice, wherewith idolaters are infected. For although it be altogether
   unlawful for men to attempt anything in religion which God hath not
   appointed, yet do they invent everything unadvisedly, and setting light
   by the Word of God, they make choice of the works of their own hands;
   but Stephen showeth that while they take such pleasure in this liberty,
   they displease God so much the more. But if we will have God to allow
   our worship, we must abstain from the works of our hands, that is, from
   our own inventions; for all that which men invent of themselves is
   nothing else but sacrilegious profanation. The idol is properly so
   called reproachfully, as it were a thing nothing worth, because no
   reason doth suffer man to make God. [450]

   Acts 7:42-43

   42. And God turned himself, and gave them up to worship the host of
   heaven: as it is written in the book of the prophets, Have ye offered
   unto me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the
   wilderness, O ye house of Israel? 43. And ye took to you the tabernacle
   of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, and figures which ye made
   to worship them; therefore I will carry you away beyond Babylon.


   Stephen will here declare that the Jews did never make an end of
   sinning, but that they wandered farther in their froward errors; so
   that that first fall of theirs was unto them as it were an entrance
   into a labyrinth. And this doth he assign unto the just vengeance of
   God, that after that time their madness grew so, that they gat for one
   idol infinity. This example teacheth us to be careful to follow the
   rule which God hath set down; because, so soon as we are turned even
   but a little aside from the same, we must needs be carried to and fro
   with divers dotings, we must needs be entangled in many superstitions,
   and be utterly drowned in the huge sink of errors; which punishment God
   in justice layeth upon men which refuse to obey his word. Therefore
   Stephen saith that God was turned away; which word imported as much as
   if he should say, that he turned his back. For he had fastened his eyes
   after a sort upon the people, when he showed his singular care which he
   took in governing them; being offended with their falling away, now he
   turneth his face another way.

   We may also hereby gather that we can no otherwise follow the right
   way, save only when the Lord watcheth over us to govern us; but so soon
   as his face is turned away, we run by and by into errors. The
   Israelites were forsaken of God even then when they made the calf; but
   Stephen meant to express the greatness of the punishment, as if he
   should have said, that they were altogether cast off into a reprobate
   sense then; as Paul also teacheth, that those which gave not glory to
   God when he had showed himself unto them, were, by the just judgment of
   God, given up unto blindness and blockishness, and unto shameful lusts,
   (Romans 1:28.) Hereby it came to pass, that after that religion began
   to be corrupt, innumerable abominations succeeded a few superstitions,
   and gross monsters of idolatry came in place of light corruptions. For
   because men neglected the light which was set before them, they became
   altogether blockish by the just judgment of God, so that they had no
   more judgment than brute beasts. Idolatry surely is very fertile, that
   of one reigned god there should by and by come an hundred, that a
   thousand superstitions should flow from one. But this so great madness
   of men springeth hence, because God revengeth himself by delivering
   them to Satan; because, after he hath once in hand to govern us, there
   is no change in his part, but he is plucked away [451] from us by our
   rash lightness.

   Have ye offered unto me slain beasts and sacrifices? This place is
   taken out of the fifth chapter of Amos, (Amos 5:25.) The speech which
   Stephen useth showeth that all the prophecies were gathered into one
   body; and Amos addeth, (after that he had inveighed against the
   idolatry and sundry sins of the people,) that this is no new evil, that
   the Jews are rebellious against God, because their fathers had fallen
   away from true godliness even in the wilderness. Furthermore, he
   denieth that they offered slain beasts to him, not because there were
   there no sacrifices at all, but because God refused their corrupt
   worship; like as he reproveth and chideth the people in Isaiah, because
   they honored him with no sacrifice,

   "Thou," (saith he,) "O Jacob, hast not called upon me, neither hast
   thou honored me with thy sacrifices, neither have I made thee serve in
   offering or incense. Thou hast not bought for me calamus, neither hast
   thou filled me with fatness. But thou hast been burdenous [burdensome]
   unto me in thy sins, and hast caused me to serve in thine iniquities,"
   (Isaiah 43:22.)

   Assuredly the Jews did all these things daily, but God accepteth not
   the obedience of the wicked, neither doth he approve the same. Again,
   he abhorreth all that which is polluted with such mingle-mangles as are
   added. [452] Thus doth Amos speak of the fathers which were revolts.
   [453] That which is added forthwith may be referred either unto them or
   unto their posterity.

   43. You took to you the tabernacle of Moloch. Some take the copulative
   for the adversative [particle,] as if he should say, Yea, rather, ye
   worshipped the idol. It may be resolved also into the conjunction
   causal, thus, You did not offer sacrifices to me, because ye erected a
   tabernacle to Moloch. But I expound it somewhat otherwise, to wit, that
   God doth first accuse the fathers for the more vehemency; and then
   afterwards he addeth, that their posterity did increase the
   superstitions, because they gat to themselves new and diverse idols; as
   if the prophet had spoken thus in the person of God, If I shall rip up
   from the beginning, (O house of Jacob,) how your kindred hath behaved
   itself toward me; your fathers began to overthrow and corrupt, even in
   the wilderness, that worship which I had commanded; but you have far
   passed their ungodliness, for you have brought in an infinite company
   of gods. And this order is fitter for Stephen's purpose; for he
   intendeth to prove, (as we have already said,) that after the
   Israelites felt away unto strange and bastardly rites, they never made
   an end of sinning, but being stricken with blindness, they polluted
   themselves every now and then with new idolatries, until they were come
   even unto the last end [454] of impiety. Therefore, Stephen confirmeth
   this sentence fitly with the testimony of the prophet, that the Jews,
   descending of wicked and rebellious fathers, had never ceased to wax
   worse and worse. And although the prophet's words be somewhat unlike to
   these, yet is the sense all one. It is to be thought that Stephen, who
   had to deal with the Jews, did repeat word for word in their tongue
   that which is in the prophet; Luke, who wrote in Greek, did follow the
   Greek interpreter. The prophet saith, Ye honored Succoth your king, and
   Chiun your image, the star of your gods. The Greek interpreter made a
   noun common of a noun proper, because of the alliance [455] of the word
   Succoth, which signifieth a tabernacle. Furthermore, I cannot tell
   whence he fetcheth that his Remphan, unless it were because that word
   was more used in that time.

   And figures which ye made. The word image, which is in the prophet,
   doth of itself signify no evil thing. Moreover, the word [tupos]; is
   taken amongst the Grecians in good part. For the ceremonies which God
   appointed are called [tupoi]; notwithstanding the prophet condemneth
   expressly the figures [types] which the Jews had made. Why so? Because
   God will not be worshipped under a visible and external form. If any
   man object that he speaketh in this place of stars; that is true, I
   confess; but I stand only upon this, that although the prophet doth
   give their idols some honest name, yet doth he sharply condemn their
   corrupt worship; whereby the foolish and childish caviling of the
   Papists is refuted. Because they deny that those images which they
   worship are idols, they say, that that mad worship of theirs is,
   [eikonodouleia], or serving of images, and not [eidolodouleia], or
   worshipping of idols. Seeing they mock God sophistically, there is no
   man that is endued even but with common understanding, which doth not
   see that they are more than ridiculous even in such toys. For although
   I move no question about the word, it is certain that the word [tupos];
   is more honorable than [eikon]. But those same [tupoi], or figures, are
   simply condemned in this place, which men make to themselves, not only
   [pros ten latreian], or that they may worship them, but [pros ten
   proskunesin], that is, that they may give them even any reverence at
   all. Therefore that filthy distinction falleth flat to the ground,
   wherein the Papists think they have a crafty starting-hole. [456]

   Beyond Babylon. The prophet nameth Damascus; neither doth the Greek
   interpretation dissent from the same. Wherefore it may be that the word
   Babylon cropt [crept] in here through error; though in the sum of the
   thing there be no great difference. The Israelites were to be carried
   away to Babylon; but because they thought that they had a sure and
   strong fortress in the kingdom of Syria, whose head Damascus was,
   therefore the prophet saith that Damascus shall not help them, but that
   God shall drive them farther; as if he should say, So long as you have
   Damascus set against your enemies, you think that you are well fenced;
   but God shall carry you away beyond it; even into Assyria and Chaldea.

   Acts 7:44-50

   44. Our fathers had the testimony of witness in the wilderness, like as
   he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according
   to the form which he had seen: 45. Which tabernacle our fathers which
   succeeded brought with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, which
   God drove out before the face of our fathers, until the days of David;
   46. Who found favor before God, and desired that he might find a
   tabernacle for the God of Jacob. 47. But Solomon built him an house.
   48. But the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as the
   prophet saith, 49. Heaven is My seat, and the earth is my footstool.
   What house will ye build for me? saith the Lord; or what place is it
   that ye should rest in? 50. Hath not my hand made all these things?


   44. The tabernacle of witness. Stephen showeth here that the blame
   cannot be laid upon God, because the Jews polluted themselves with
   divers superstitions, as if God had suffered them to wander freely.
   [457] For he saith that God had commanded how he would be worshipped by
   them. Whereupon it followeth that they were entangled in so many
   errors, because they would not follow that form which God had
   appointed. Although he girdeth [reprehendeth] them for two causes:
   Because, being not content with that rule alone which God had
   prescribed, they invented to themselves strange worships; secondly,
   because they had no respect unto the right end of the temple, and of
   the ceremonies which God had appointed. For whereas they ought to have
   been unto them exercises of the spiritual worship, they apprehended
   nothing but that which was carnal, according to their carnal nature;
   [458] that is, they took the shadow for the body.

   Therefore we see that the Jews were first reprehended for their
   boldness, for because that being not content with the plain word of
   God, they were carried away after their own inventions. Secondly, they
   are reproved for the preposterous abuse of the true and sincere
   worship; because they followed the flesh instead of the Spirit. They
   had, saith he, the tabernacle of witness. Therefore it was their own
   wantonness and rashness only which caused them to sin. For seeing they
   were well taught what was the right way and order of worshipping God,
   all cloak and color of ignorance was taken away.

   Which thing is worth the noting. For seeing God doth after a sort
   bridle us, when he maketh his will known unto us, if after we have
   received his commandment we turn aside, either unto the right hand or
   to the left, we be twice guilty; because the servant which knoweth his
   master's will, and doth it not, shall suffer more stripes: This is the
   first mark whereby the Holy Spirit doth distinguish all bastardly and
   corrupt worshippings from the true and sincere worship. Yea, (to speak
   more briefly,) the first difference between true worship and idolatry
   is this: when the godly take in hand nothing but that which is
   agreeable to the Word of God, but the other think all that lawful which
   pleaseth themselves, and so they count their own will a law; whereas
   God alloweth nothing but that which he himself hath appointed. To this
   end serveth the word witness.

   The Hebrew word [md] (moed) signifieth, indeed, an appointed place and
   time, or an assembly of men; but the reason expressed in Moses showeth
   that there is another cause why it is so named. For in Moses this is
   oftentimes repeated, "I will meet with you there." Therefore the
   tabernacle was consecrated by the covenant and the word of the Lord,
   and his voice was heard there continually, that it might be
   distinguished from all profane places.

   According to the form which he had seen. This is referred unto the
   second point which I have touched; for it may be that he which shall
   use the ceremonies only which God appointed, shall notwithstanding
   worship God amiss. For God careth not for external rites, save only
   inasmuch as they are of the heavenly truth; therefore God would have
   the tabernacle to be made like unto the heavenly figure, [459] that the
   Jews might know that they were not to stay still in the external
   figures. Furthermore, let him which is disposed read my Commentaries
   upon the Epistle to the Hebrews, and he shall see what that figure,
   whereof mention is made Exodus 25, (Exodus 25:40; Hebrews 8:5,) did
   signify. Stephen doth only briefly tell them in this place that the
   worship which God commanded the Jews is spiritual, and that they,
   according to their carnal blockishness, were evil and false
   interpreters; therefore, as we have said, that God alloweth no worship
   but that which is grounded in his commandment, so we are taught here
   that it is requisite in the right use of the commandment, that the
   spiritual truth be present; which thing being granted, it was the like
   question which we said did consist principally in this issue, whether
   the shadows ought to yield to the body or not. Whereas Moses is said to
   have seen a form or figure, the Spirit of God signifieth thereby that
   it is unlawful for us to invent forms at our pleasure; but that all our
   senses must be set upon that form which God showeth, that all our
   religion may be formed according to it. The word figure signifieth
   here, in this place, the principal pattern, [460] which is nothing else
   but the spiritual truth.

   45. Which they brought in. This serveth to increase the frowardness
   [461] of the nation, that whereas the tabernacle did continue with
   them, and they carried the same whithersoever they went, yet could they
   not be kept within the bounds of God's covenant, but they would have
   strange and profane rites; to wit, declaring that God dwelt amidst
   them, from whom they were so far distant, and whom they did drive out
   of that inheritance which he had given them. To this purpose serveth
   that also, that God did beautify the tabernacle with divers miracles;
   for the worthiness thereof [462] was established by those victories
   which the Jews had gotten, as it appeareth by divers places of the holy
   history; therefore, it must needs be that they were very disobedient,
   which did not cease oftentimes to start aside from that worship which
   was so many ways approved.

   Until the days of David. Although the ark of the Lord continued long in
   Shiloh, yet it had no certain place until the reign of David, (1 Samuel
   1:3;) for it was unlawful for men to erect a place for the same, but it
   was to be placed in that place which the Lord had showed, as Moses
   saith oftentimes. Neither durst David himself, after he had taken it
   from the enemies, bring it into the thrashing-floor of Araunah until
   the Lord had declared, by an angel from heaven, that that was the place
   which he had chosen, (2 Samuel 24:16.) And Stephen counteth this a
   singular benefit of God, not without great cause, that the place was
   showed to David wherein the Israelites should hereafter worship God; as
   in the Psalm he rejoiceth as over some notable thing: "I was glad when
   they said unto me, We will go into the house of the Lord; our feet
   shall be stable in thy courts, O Jerusalem," (Psalm 132:3) The
   priesthood was coupled with the kingdom; therefore, the stability of
   the kingdom is showed in the resting of the ark; therefore it is said
   that he desired this so earnestly that he bound himself with a solemn
   vow, that he would not come within his house, that his eyes should
   enjoy no sleep, nor his temples any rest, until he should know a place
   for the Lord, and a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. Furthermore, the
   place was showed to David, but it was granted to Solomon to build the
   temple, (1 Kings 5:7.)

   47. Solomon built. Stephen seemeth to gird Solomon glancingly [463] in
   this place, as if he did not regard the nature of God in building the
   temple; yet did he attempt that work not without the commandment of
   God. There was also a promise added, wherein God did testify that he
   would be present with his people there. I answer, that when Stephen
   denieth that God dwelleth in temples made with hands, that is not
   referred unto Solomon, who knew full well that God was to be sought in
   heaven, and that men's minds must be lifted up thither by faith; which
   thing he uttered also in that solemn prayer which he made:

   "The heaven of heavens do not contain thee,
   and how much less this house?"
   (1 Kings 8:23;)

   but he reproveth the blockishness of the people, which abused the
   temple, as if it had had God tied to it; which appeareth more plainly
   by the testimony of Isaiah, (Isaiah 6:6,) which he citeth also; God,
   saith he, would have Solomon to build him a temple; but they were
   greatly deceived who thought that he was, as it were, included in such
   a building; as he complaineth by his prophet that the people do him
   injury, when as they imagine that he is tied to a place; but the
   prophet doth not for that cause only inveigh against the Jews, because
   they worshipped God superstitiously, thinking that his power was tied
   to the temple, but because they did esteem him according to their own
   affection, and, therefore, after that they had ended [464] their
   sacrifices and external pomp, they imagined that he was pleased, and
   that they had brought him indebted to them. This was almost a common
   error in all ages; because men thought that cold ceremonies were
   sufficient enough for the worship of God. The reason is, because
   forasmuch as they are carnal, and wholly set upon the world, they
   imagine that God is like to them; therefore, to the end God may take
   from them this blockishness, he saith that he filleth all things.

   49. For whereas he saith, that heaven is his seat, and the earth his
   footstool, it must not be so understood as if he had a body, or could
   be divided into parts, after the manner of men; but because he is
   infinity, therefore he saith that he cannot be comprehended within any
   spaces of place; therefore, those men are deceived who esteem God or
   his worship according to their own nature; and because the prophet had
   to deal with hypocrites, he doth not only dispute about the essence of
   God, but also teacheth generally, that he is far unlike to men, and
   that he is not moved with the vain pomp of this world as they are. Here
   ariseth that question also, why the prophet saith that the Lord hath no
   place of rest in the world, whereas, notwithstanding, the Spirit
   affirmeth the contrary elsewhere, "This is my rest for ever," (Psalm
   132:14.) Moreover, Isaiah doth adorn the Church with this self-same
   title, that it is the glorious rest of God, alluding unto the temple, I
   answer, that when God appointed signs of his presence ill the temple,
   and sacrifices in times past, he did not this to the end he might
   settle and fasten himself and his power there; therefore, the
   Israelites did wickedly, who, setting their minds wholly upon the
   signs, did forge to themselves an earthly God. They dealt also ungodly,
   who under this color took to themselves liberty to sin, as if they
   could readily and easily pacify God with bare ceremonies. Thus doth the
   world use to mock God.

   When God doth declare, by the external rites, that he will be present
   with his, that he may dwell in the midst of them, he commandeth them to
   lift up their minds, that they may seek him spiritually. Hypocrites,
   which are entangled in the world, will rather pluck God out of heaven;
   and whereas they have nothing but vain and bare figures, they are
   puffed up with such foolish confidence, that they pamper themselves in
   their sins carelessly, so, at this day, the Papists include Christ in
   the bread and wine in their imagination; that done, so soon as they
   have worshipped their idol with foolish worship, they vaunt and crack
   as if they were as holy as angels. We must diligently note these two
   vices, that men do superstitiously forge to themselves a carnal and
   worldly God which doth so come down unto them, that they remain still
   having their minds set upon the earth, and that they rise not up in
   mind to heaven. Again, they dream that God is pacified with frivolous
   obedience; hereby it cometh to pass, that they are besotted in the
   visible signs; and, secondly, that [465] they go about to bring God
   indebted to them after a childish manner, and with things which be
   nothing worth.

   Now we understand in what sense the prophet saith that God hath no
   place of rest in the world. He would, indeed, that the temple should
   have been a sign and pledge of his presence, yet only to the godly,
   which did ascend into heaven in heart, which did worship him
   spiritually with pure faith; but he hath no place of rest with the
   superstitious, who, through their foolish inventions, tie him unto the
   elements of the world, or do erect unto him an earthly worship; neither
   yet with hypocrites, who are puffed up with drunken confidence, as if
   they had done their duty towards God well, after that they have played
   in their toys. In sum, the promise received by faith doth cause God to
   hear us in his temple, as if he were present to show forth his power in
   the sacraments; but unless we rise up unto him by faith, we shall have
   no presence of his. Hereby we may easily gather, that when he dwelleth
   amidst those that be his, he is neither tied to the earth, neither
   comprehended in any place, because they seek him spiritually in heaven.

   50. Hath not mine hand? The prophet telleth the people in these words,
   that God hath no need either of gold, either of precious furniture of
   the temple, either of the sacrifices; whereupon it followeth that his
   true worship is not contained in ceremonies. For he desireth none of
   all these things which we offer unto him, for his own sake, but only
   that he may exercise us in the study of godliness; which argument is
   handled more at large, Psalm 1. For although this be a shameful
   foolishness to go about to feed God with sacrifices, yet unless
   hypocrites were drowned in the same, they would make no such account of
   toys, because all that is unsavory before God which dissenteth from the
   spiritual worship; therefore, let us know that God seeketh us and not
   ours, which we have only at pleasure; and hereby it appeareth also what
   great difference there is between true religion and the carnal
   inventions of men.

   Acts 7: 51-53

   51. You stiff-necked, and of an uncircumcised heart and ears, ye have
   always resisted the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye. 52.
   Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have
   slain those which foretold of the coming of the Just; of whom you are
   now made the betrayers and murderers: 53. Who have received the law in
   the dispositions of angels, and have not kept it.


   51. Forasmuch as Stephen doth not expressly answer the points of the
   accusation, I am of their mind who think that he would have said more,
   if his oration had not been broken off with some uproar. For we know
   what a session of judges he had; therefore, no marvel if they enforced
   him to hold his peace with noise and outcries. And we see, also, that
   he did use long insinuation of set purpose, that he might tame and
   appease them who were like brute beasts most cruel; but it is likely
   that their madness was then incensed, when he proved that they had most
   wickedly corrupted the law, that the temple was polluted with their
   superstitions, and that there is nothing sincere amongst them; because,
   whilst they did stick in bare figures, they did not worship God
   spiritually, because they did not refer the ceremonies unto the
   heavenly figure; but though Stephen did not enter the cause
   straightway, but essayed to make their fierce minds somewhat more
   gentle by little and little, yet did he reason very fitly, to purge
   himself of the crime laid to his charge.

   These two things, as we have said, were the principal points of the
   question, that Stephen had blasphemed God and his temple; that he went
   about to disannul the law. That Stephen might clear himself of both
   these false slanders, he began at the calling of Abraham, and declareth
   that the Jews excelled the Gentiles, not of their own nature, not by
   any right of their own, not by any merits of works, but by a free
   privilege, because God had adopted them in the person of Abraham. This
   is also very pertinent to the cause, that the covenant of salvation was
   made with Abraham before any temple or ceremonies were, yea, before
   circumcision was appointed. Of which things the Jews did so boast, that
   they said there was no worship of God without them, neither any
   holiness. After that he set down how wonderful and manifold the
   goodness of God was towards Abraham's stock, and again how wickedly and
   frowardly they had refused, so much as in them lay, the grace of God;
   whereby it appeareth that it cannot be ascribed to their own merits
   that they are counted God's people, but because God did choose them of
   his own accord, being unworthy, and did not cease to do them good,
   though they were most unthankful. Their lofty and proud spirits might
   by this means have been subdued, tamed, and humbled, that being emptied
   of that wind of foolish glory they might come unto the Mediator.
   Thirdly, he declared that the Angel was the governor and chief, in
   giving the law and delivering the people, and that Moses did so serve
   in his function, that he taught that there should come other prophets
   hereafter, who should, notwithstanding, have one which should be the
   chief of them, that he might make an end of all prophecies, and that he
   might bring the perfect accomplishment of them all. Whereby it is
   gathered that those are nothing less than Moses' disciples, who reject
   that kind of doctrine which was promised and commended in the law,
   together with the author thereof.

   Last of all, he showeth that all the old worship which was prescribed
   by Moses is not to be esteemed of itself, but that it ought rather to
   be referred to another end, because it was made according to the
   heavenly pattern; and that the Jews have always been wicked
   interpreters of the law, because they conceived nothing but that which
   was earthly. Hereby is it proved that there is no injury done to the
   temple and the law when Christ is made, as it were, the end and truth
   of both, But because the state of the cause did consist chiefly in
   this, that the worship of God doth not properly consist in sacrifices
   and other things, and that all ceremonies did nothing else but shadow
   Christ, Stephen was purposed to stand upon this point if the Jews would
   have permitted him; but because, when he was come to the pith of the
   matter, they cannot abide to hear any more, (they were so incensed with
   fury,) the application of those things which he had said, unto this
   cause which he had in hand, is wanting. And he is enforced to use a
   sharp reprehension for a conclusion, Ye of an hard neck, saith he,
   (Exodus 32:9; 33:3,5.) We see how soon he is offended with them with an
   holy zeal, but because he saw that he spake many things to small end,
   especially before deaf men, he breaketh off his doctrine. This is a
   metaphor taken from horses or oxen, which Moses useth often, when he
   will say that his people is a rebellious people, and disobedient to
   God, and also unruly.

   The upbraiding which followeth was of greater force with them.
   Circumcision was unto them a vail and covering to cover all vices.
   Therefore, when he calleth them uncircumcised in heart, he doth not
   only mean that they are rebellious against God and stubborn, but that
   they were found treacherous and covenant-breakers, even in that sign
   whereof they did so greatly boast; and so he turneth that back most
   fitly to their shame, whereof they made boast to their glory. For this
   is all one, as if he should have said that they had broken the covenant
   of the Lord, so that their circumcision was void and profane. This
   speech is taken out of the law and the prophets. For as God hath
   appointed the sign, so he would have the Jews know to what end they
   were circumcised; to wit, that they might circumcise their hearts and
   all their corrupt affections to the Lord, as we read, "And now
   circumcise your hearts to the Lord," Wherefore, the letter of
   circumcision, as Paul calleth it, is a vain visor with God, (Romans
   2:28.) So, forasmuch as at this day the spiritual washing is the truth
   of our baptism, it is to be feared, lest that may well be objected to
   us, that we are not partakers of baptism, because our souls and flesh
   are polluted with filthiness.

   Ye have always resisted. At the first Stephen vouchsafed to call these
   men fathers and brethren, against whom he inveigheth thus sharply,
   Therefore, so long as there remained any hope that they might be made
   more gentle, he dealt not only friendly with them, but he spake
   honorably unto them. Now, so soon as he espieth their desperate
   stubbornness, he doth not only take from them all honor, but lest he
   should have any fellowship with them, he speaketh unto them as unto men
   of another kindred. You, saith he, are like to your fathers, who have
   always rebelled against the Spirit of God. But he himself came of the
   same fathers; and yet that he may couple himself to Christ, he
   forgetteth his kindred, inasmuch as it was wicked. And yet for all
   this, he bindeth them not all in one bundle, as they say, but he
   speaketh unto the multitude.

   And those are said to resist the Spirit who reject [466] him when he
   speaketh in the prophets. Neither doth he speak in this place of secret
   revelations, wherewith God inspireth every one, but of the external
   ministry; which we must note diligently. He purposeth to take from the
   Jews all color of excuse; and, therefore, he upbraideth unto them, that
   they had purposely, and not of ignorance, resisted God. Whereby it
   appeareth what great account the Lord maketh of his word, and how
   reverently he will have us to receive the same. Therefore, lest, like
   giants, we make war against God, let us learn to hearken to the
   ministers by whose mouth he teacheth us.

   52. Which of the prophets? Forasmuch as they ought not to bear their
   fathers' fault, Stephen seemeth to deal unjustly, in that he reckoneth
   this amongst their faults unto whom he speaketh; but he had just causes
   so to do. First, because they did vaunt that they were Abraham's holy
   progeny, it was worth the labor to show unto them how great vanity that
   was, as if Stephen should say, that there is no cause why they should
   vaunt of their stock, forasmuch as they come of those who were wicked
   murderers of the prophets. So that he toucheth that glancingly which is
   more plainly set down by the prophets, that they are not the children
   of prophets, but a degenerate and bastardly issue, the seed of Canaan,
   etc. Which thing we may at this day object to the Papists, when as they
   so highly extol their fathers. Furthermore, this serveth to amplify
   withal, whereas he saith that it is no new thing for them to resist the
   truth, but that they have this wickedness, as it were, by inheritance
   from their fathers. Furthermore, it was requisite for Stephen by this
   means to pluck from their faces the visor of the Church, wherewith they
   burdened him. [467] This was an unmeet prejudice against the doctrine
   of the gospel, in that they boasted that they are the Church of God,
   and did challenge this title [468] by long succession. Therefore,
   Stephen preventeth them on the contrary, and proveth that their fathers
   did, no less than they, rage against the prophets, through wicked
   contempt and hatred of sound doctrine. Lastly, this is the continual
   custom of the Scripture to gather the fathers and children together
   [469] under the same guiltiness, seeing they pollute themselves with
   the same offenses, and that famous sentence of Christ answereth
   thereto, "Fulfill the measure of your fathers, until the just blood
   come upon you, from Abel unto Zacharias."

   Who have foretold. Hereby we gather that this was the drift of all the
   prophets, to direct their nation unto Christ, as he is the end of the
   law, (Romans 10:4.) It were too long to gather all the prophecies
   wherein the coming of Christ was foretold. Let it suffice to know this
   generally, that it was the common office of all the prophets to promise
   salvation by the grace of Christ. Christ is called in this place the
   Just, not only to note his innocency, but of the effect, because it is
   proper to him to appoint justice in the world. And even in this place
   doth Stephen prove that the Jews were altogether unworthy of the
   benefit of redemption, because the fathers did not only refuse that in
   times past, which was witnessed unto them by the prophets, but they did
   also cruelly murder the messengers of grace, and their children
   endeavored to extinguish the author of righteousness and salvation
   which was offered unto them. By which comparison Christ teacheth that
   the wicked conspiracy of his enemies was an heap of all iniquities.

   53. Who have received the law. They called that fury wherewith they
   raged against Stephen zeal of the law, as if he had been a forsaker of
   the law, and a revolt [470] and had enforced others to fall away in
   like sort. Although he was determined to clear himself of this false
   accusation, yet he did not go through with his answer. For he could not
   be heard, and it was to no end to speak to deaf men. Therefore, he is
   content, at a word, to take from them their false color and pretense.
   It is evident, saith he, that you lie, when you pretend the zeal of the
   law, which you transgress and break without ceasing; and as he objected
   unto them in the words next going before, the treacherous murder of the
   Just, so now he upbraideth unto them their revolting from the law. Some
   man will say that Stephen's cause is no whit bettered hereby, because
   the Jews break the law. But as we have already said, Stephen doth not
   so chide them, as if his defense did principally consist in this issue,
   but that they may not flatter themselves in their false boasting. For
   hypocrites must be handled thus, who will, notwithstanding, seem to be
   most earnest defenders of God's glory, though indeed they condemn him
   carelessly. And here is also a fit antistrophe, because they made
   semblance that they received the law which was committed to them, which
   was, notwithstanding, reproachfully despised by them.

   In the dispositions of angels It is word for word, into the
   dispositions, but it is all one. Furthermore, we need not seek any
   other interpreter of this saying than Paul, who saith that the law was
   disposed or ordained by angels, (Galatians 3:16;) for he useth the
   participle there whereof this noun is derived. And his meaning is, that
   the angels were the messengers of God, and his witnesses in publishing
   the law, that the authority thereof might be firm and stable.

   Therefore, forasmuch as God did call the angels to be, as it were,
   solemn witnesses when he gave the Jews his law, the same angels shall
   be witnesses of their unfaithfulness. [471] And to this end doth
   Stephen make mention of the angels, that he may accuse the Jews in
   presence of them, and prove them guilty, because they have transgressed
   the law. Hereby we may gather what shall become of the despisers of the
   gospel, which doth so far excel the law, that it doth, after a sort,
   darken the glory thereof, as Paul teacheth, (2 Corinthians 3.)

   Acts 7:54-58

   54. Furthermore, when they heard these things, they were cut asunder in
   their hearts, and they gnashed upon him with their teeth. 55. But
   forasmuch as he was full of the Holy Ghost, he looked up steadfastly
   into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right
   hand of God; 56. And he said, Behold, I see the heavens open, and the
   Son of man standing at the right hand of God. And they cried with a
   loud voice, and stopped their ears; 57. And with one accord they ran
   upon him: 58. And having cast him out of the city, they stoned him.


   54. When they heard. The beginning of the action had in it some color
   of judgment; but at length the judges cannot bridle their fury. First,
   they interrupt him with murmuring and noise, now they break out into
   envious and deadly cryings, [472] lest they should hear any one word.
   Afterward they hale the holy man (out of the city,) that they may put
   him to death. And Luke expresseth properly what force Satan hath to
   drive forward the adversaries of the word. When he saith that they
   burst asunder inwardly, he noteth that they were not only angry, but
   they were also stricken with madness. Which fury breaketh out into the
   gnashing of the teeth, as a violent fire into flame. The reprobate, who
   are at Satan's commandment, must needs be thus moved with the hearing
   of the word of God; and this is the state of the gospel, it driveth
   hypocrites into madness who might seem before to be modest, as if a
   drunken man who is desirous of sleep be suddenly awakened. Therefore,
   Simeon assigneth this to Christ, as proper to him, to disclose the
   thoughts of many hearts, (Luke 2:35.) Yet, notwithstanding, this ought
   not to be ascribed to the doctrine of salvation, whose end is rather
   this, to tame men's minds to obey God after that it hath subdued them.
   But so soon as Satan hath possessed their minds, if they be urged,
   their ungodliness will break out. Therefore, this is an accidentary
   [accidental] evil; yet we are taught by these examples, that we must
   not look that the word of God should draw all men unto a sound mind.

   Which doctrine is very requisite for us unto constancy. Those which are
   teachers cannot do their duty as they ought, but they must set
   themselves against the contemners of God. And forasmuch as there are
   always some wicked men, which set light by the majesty of God, they
   must ever now and then have recourse unto this vehemency of Stephen.
   For they may not wink when God's honor is taken from him. And what
   shall be the end thereof? Their ungodliness shall be the more incensed,
   so that we shall seem to pour oil into the fire, (as they say.) But
   whatsoever come of it, yet must we not spare the wicked, but we must
   keep them down mightily, although they could pour out all the furies of
   hell. And it is certain that those which will flatter the wicked do not
   respect the fruit, [473] but are faint-hearted through fear of danger.
   But as for us, howsoever we have no such success as we could wish, let
   us know that courage in defending the doctrine of godliness is a
   sweet-smelling sacrifice to God.

   55. Forasmuch as he was full. We cannot almost express into what
   straits the servant of Christ was brought, when he saw himself beset
   round with raging enemies; the goodness of his cause was oppressed,
   partly with false accusations and malice, partly with violence and
   outrageous outcries; he was environed with stern countenances on every
   side; he himself was haled unto a cruel and horrible kind of death; he
   could espy succor and ease no where. Therefore, being thus destitute of
   man's help, he turneth himself toward God. We must first note this,
   that Stephen did look unto God, who is the judge of life and death,
   (turning his eyes from beholding the world,) when he was brought into
   extreme despair of all things, whilst that there is nothing but death
   before his eyes. This done, we must also add this, that his expectation
   was not in vain, because Christ appeared to him by and by. Although
   Luke doth signify, that he was now armed with such power of the Spirit
   as could not be overcome, so that nothing could hinder him from
   beholding the heavens; therefore Stephen looketh up toward heaven, that
   he may gather courage by beholding Christ; that dying he may triumph
   gloriously, having overcome death. But as for us, it is no marvel if
   Christ do not show himself to us, because we are so set and tied upon
   the earth. Hereby it cometh to pass, that our hearts fail us at every
   light rumor of danger, and even at the falling of a leaf. And that for
   good causes; for where is our strength but in Christ? But we pass over
   the heavens, as if we had no help any where else, save only in the
   world, Furthermore, this vice can be redressed by no other means than
   if God lift us up by his Spirit, being naturally set upon the earth.
   Therefore, Luke assigneth this cause, why Stephen looked up steadfastly
   toward heaven, because he was full of the Spirit. We must also ascend
   into heaven, having this Spirit to be our director and guide, so often
   as we are oppressed with troubles. And, surely, until such time as he
   illuminate us, our eyes are not so quick of sight, that they can come
   unto heaven. Yea, the eyes of the flesh are so dull, that they cannot
   ascend into heaven.

   He saw the glory of God. Luke signifieth, as I have said, that Christ
   appeared forthwith to Stephen so soon as he lifted up his eyes towards
   heaven. But he telleth us before, that he had other eyes given him than
   the fleshly eyes, seeing that with the same [474] he flieth up unto the
   glory of God. Whence we must gather a general comfort, that God will be
   no less present with us, if, forsaking the world, all our senses strive
   to come to him; not that he appeareth unto us by any external vision,
   as he did to Stephen, but he will so reveal himself unto us within,
   that we may indeed feel his presence. And this manner of seeing ought
   to be sufficient for us, when God doth not only, by his power and
   grace, declare that he is nigh at hand, but doth also prove that he
   dwelleth in us.

   56. Behold, I see the heavens. God meant not only privately to provide
   for his servant, but also to wring and torment his enemies; as Stephen
   doth courageously triumph over them, when he affirmeth plainly that he
   saw a miracle. And here may a question be moved, how the heavens were
   opened? For mine own part, I think that there was nothing changed in
   the nature of the heavens; but that Stephen had new quickness of sight
   granted him, which pierced through all lets, even unto the invisible
   glory of the kingdom of heaven. For admit we grant that there was some
   division or parting [475] made in heaven, yet man's eye could never
   reach so far. Again, Stephen alone did see the glory of God. For that
   spectacle was not only hid from the wicked, who stood in the same
   place, but they were also so blinded within themselves, that they did
   not see the manifest truth. [476] Therefore, he saith that the heavens
   are opened to him in this respect, because nothing keepeth him from
   beholding the glory of God. Whereupon it followeth that the miracle was
   not wrought in heaven, but in his eyes. Wherefore, there is no cause
   why we should dispute long about any natural vision; because it is
   certain that Christ appeared unto him not after some natural manner,
   but after a new and singular sort. And I pray you of what color was the
   glory of God, that it could be seen naturally with the eyes of the
   flesh? Therefore, we must imagine nothing in this vision but that which
   is divine. Moreover, this is worth the noting, that the glory of God
   appeared not unto Stephen wholly as it was, but according to man's
   capacity. For that infiniteness cannot be comprehended with the measure
   of any creature.

   The Son of man standing. He seeth Christ reigning in that flesh wherein
   he was abased; so that in very deed the victory did consist in this one
   thing. Therefore, it is not superfluous in that Christ appeareth unto
   him, and for this cause doth he also call him the Son of man, as if he
   should say, I see that man whom ye thought ye had quite extinguished by
   death enjoying the government of heaven; therefore, gnash with your
   teeth as much as you list: there is no cause why I should fear to fight
   for him even unto blood, who shall not only defend his own cause, but
   my salvation also. Notwithstanding, here may a question be moved, why
   he saw him standing, who is said elsewhere to sit? Augustine, as he is
   sometimes more subtle than needs, saith, "that he sitteth as a judge,
   that he stood then as an advocate." For mine own part, I think that
   though these speeches be diverse, yet they signify both one thing. For
   neither sitting, nor yet standing, noteth out how the body of Christ
   was framed; but this is referred unto his power and kingdom. For where
   shall we erect him a throne, that he may sit at the right hand of God
   the Father, seeing God doth fill all things in such sort, that we ought
   to imagine no place for his right hand?

   Therefore, the whole text is a metaphor, when Christ is said to sit or
   stand at the right hand of God the Father, and the plain meaning is
   this, that Christ hath all power given him, that he may reign in his
   Father's stead in that flesh wherein he was humbled, and that he may be
   next him. And although this power be spread abroad through heaven and
   earth, yet some men imagine amiss that Christ in every where in his
   human nature. For, though he be contained in a certain place, yet that
   hindereth no whit but that he may and doth show forth his power
   throughout all the world. Therefore, if we be desirous to feel him
   present by the working of his grace, we must seek him in heaven; as he
   revealed himself unto Stephen there. Also, some men do affirm
   ridiculously out of this place, that he drew near unto Stephen that he
   might see him. [477] For we have already said, that Stephen's eyes were
   so lifted up by the power of the Spirit, [478] that no distance of
   place could hinder the same. I confess, indeed, that speaking properly,
   that is, philosophically, there is no place above the heavens. But this
   is sufficient for me, that it is perverse doting to place Christ any
   where else save only in heaven, and above the elements of the world.

   57. Crying with a loud voice. This was either a vain show of zeal, as
   hypocrites are almost always pricked forward with ambition to break out
   into immoderate heat; as Caiaphas when he heard Christ say thus, After
   this ye shall see the Son of man, etc., did rent his clothes in token
   of indignation, as if it were intolerable blasphemy; or else certainly
   the preaching of the glory of Christ was unto them such a torment, that
   they must needs burst through madness. And I am rather of this mind;
   for Luke saith afterward, that they were carried violently, as those
   men which have no hold of themselves use to leap out immoderately.
   [479]

   58. They stoned. God had appointed this kind of punishment in the law
   for false prophets, as it is written in the 13th chapter of
   Deuteronomy; but God doth also define there who ought to be reckoned in
   that number; to wit, he which doth attempt to bring the people unto
   strange gods; therefore the stoning of Stephen was both unjust and also
   wicked, because he was unjustly condemned; so that the martyrs of
   Christ must suffer like punishment with the wicked. It is the cause
   alone which maketh the difference; but this difference is so highly
   esteemed before God and his angels, that the rebukes of the martyrs
   [480] do far excel all glory of the world. Yet here may a question be
   moved, How it was lawful for the Jews to stone Stephen, who had not the
   government in their hands? For in Christ's cause they answer, It is not
   lawful for us to put any man to death. I answer, that they did this
   violently and in an uproar. And whereas the president did not punish
   this wickedness, it may be that he winked at many things, [481] lest
   they should bring that hatred upon his own head which they bare against
   the name of Christ. We see that the Roman presidents did chiefly wink
   at the civil discords of that nation, even of set purpose; that when
   one of them had murdered another, [482] they might the sooner be
   overcome afterward.

   Acts 7:58-61

   And the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, named
   Saul. 59. And they stoned Stephen, calling on, and saying, Lord Jesus,
   receive my spirit. 60. And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud
   voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said
   thus, he fell on sleep. 61. And Saul consented [was consenting] to his
   death.


   And the witnesses. Luke signifieth, that even in that tumult they
   observed some show of judgment. This was not commanded in vain that the
   witnesses should throw the first stone; because, seeing they must
   commit the murder with their own hands, many are holden with a certain
   dread, who otherwise are less afraid to cut the throats of the innocent
   with perjury of the tongue. But in the mean season, we gather how blind
   and mad the ungodliness of these witnesses was, who are not afraid to
   imbrue their bloody hands with the blood of an innocent, who had
   already committed murder with their tongues. Whereas he saith, that
   their clothes were laid down at the feet of Saul, he showeth that there
   was no let in him, but that being cast into a reprobate sense he might
   have perished with the rest. [483] For who would not think that he was
   a desperate, [desperado,] who had infected his youth with such cruelty?
   [484] Neither is his age expressed to lessen his fault, as some
   unskillful men go about to prove; for he was of those years, that want
   of knowledge could no whit excuse him. And Luke will shortly after
   declare, that he was sent by the high priest to persecute the faithful.
   Therefore he was no child, he might well be counted a man. Why, then,
   is his youth mentioned? That every man may consider with himself what
   great hurt he might have done in God's Church, unless Christ had
   bridled him betimes. And therein appeareth a most notable token both of
   God's power and also of his grace, in that he tamed a fierce and wild
   beast in his chief fury, even in a moment, and in that he extolled a
   miserable murderer so highly who through his wickedness was drowned
   almost in the deep pit of hell.

   59. Calling on. Because he had uttered words enough before men, though
   in vain, he turneth himself now unto God for good causes, and armeth
   himself with prayer to suffer all things. For although we have need to
   run unto God's help every minute of an hour during our whole warfare,
   yet we have greatest need to call upon God in the last conflict, which
   is the hardest.

   And Luke expresseth again how furious mad they were, because their
   cruelty was not assuaged even when they saw the servant of Christ
   praying humbly. Furthermore, here is set down a prayer of Stephen
   having two members. In the former member, where he commendeth his
   spirit to Christ, he showeth the constancy of his faith. In the other,
   where he prayeth for his enemies, he testifieth his love towards men.
   Forasmuch as the whole perfection of godliness consisteth upon [of]
   these two parts, we have in the death of Stephen a rare example of a
   godly and holy death. It is to be thought that he used many more words,
   but the sum tendeth to this end.

   Lord Jesus. I have already said, that this prayer was a witness of
   confidence; and surely the courageousness and violentness [485] of
   Stephen was great, that when as he saw the stones fly about his ears,
   wherewith he should be stoned by and by; when as he heareth cruel
   curses and reproaches against his head, he yet stayeth himself meekly
   [486] upon the grace of Christ. In like sort, the Lord will have his
   servants to be brought to nought as it were sometimes, to the end their
   salvation may be the more wonderful, And let us define this salvation
   not by the understanding of our flesh, [487] but by faith. We see how
   Stephen leaneth not unto the judgment of the flesh, but rather assuring
   himself, even in very destruction, that he shall be saved, he suffereth
   death with a quiet mind. For undoubtedly he was assured of this, that
   our life is hid with Christ in God, (Colossians 3:3.)

   Therefore, casting off all care of the body, he is content to commit
   his soul into the hands of Christ. For he could not pray thus from his
   heart, unless, having forgotten this life, he had cast off all care of
   the same.

   It behoveth us with David (Psalm 31:6) to commit our souls into the
   hands of God daily so long as we are in the world, because we are
   environed with a thousand deaths, that God may deliver our life from
   all dangers; but when we must die indeed, and we are called thereunto,
   we must fly unto this prayer, that Christ will receive our spirit. For
   he commended his own spirit into the hands of his Father, to this end,
   that he may keep ours for ever. This is an inestimable comfort, in that
   we know our souls do not wander up and down [488] when they flit out of
   our bodies, but that Christ receiveth them, that he may keep them
   faithfully, if we commend them into his hands. This hope ought to
   encourage us to suffer death patiently. Yea, whosoever commendeth his
   soul to Christ with an earnest affection of faith, he must needs resign
   himself wholly to his pleasure and will. And this place doth plainly
   testify that the soul of man is no vain blast which vanisheth away, as
   some frantic fellows imagine dotingly, [489] but that it is an
   essential spirit which liveth after this life. Furthermore, we are
   taught hereby that we call upon Christ rightly and lawfully, because
   all power is given him of the Father, for this cause, that all men may
   commit themselves to his tuition. [490]

   60. Kneeling down, he cried. This is the other part of his prayer,
   wherein he joineth the love of men with faith in Christ; and surely if
   we desire to be gathered to Christ for our salvation, we must put on
   this affection. Whereas Stephen prayeth for his enemies, and those most
   deadly, and even in the very instant when their cruelty might provoke
   him unto desire of revenge, he declareth sufficiently what affection he
   beareth toward all other men.

   And we know that we are all commanded [491] to do the same which
   Stephen did; [492] but because there is nothing more hard than so to
   forgive injuries, that we will wish well to those who would have us
   undone, (Matthew 5:43, 44;) therefore we must always set Stephen before
   our eyes for an example. He crieth indeed with a loud voice, but he
   maketh show of nothing before men which was not spoken sincerely and
   from the heart, as God himself doth witness. Yet he crieth aloud, that
   he may omit nothing which might serve to assuage the cruelty of the
   enemies. The fruit appeared not forthwith, yet undoubtedly he prayed
   not in vain; and Paul is unto us a sufficient testimony [493] that this
   sin was not laid to all their charges. I will not say as Augustine,
   that unless Stephen had prayed the Church should not have had Paul; for
   this is somewhat hard; only I say this, that whereas God pardoned Paul,
   it appeareth thereby that Stephen's prayer was not in vain. Here
   ariseth a question, how Stephen prayeth for those which he said of late
   did resist the Holy Ghost; but this seemeth to be the sin against the
   Spirit which shall never be forgiven? We may easily answer, that that
   is pronounced generally of all which belongeth to many everywhere;
   therefore, he called not the body of the people rebellious in such sort
   that he exempted none. Again, I have declared before what manner of
   resisting he condemned in that place; for it followeth not by and by,
   that they sin against the Holy Ghost who resist him for a time. When he
   prayeth that God will not lay the sin to their charge, his meaning is,
   that the guiltiness may not remain in them.

   And when he had said thus, he fell on sleep. This was added, that we
   may know that these words were uttered even when he was ready to yield
   up the ghost, which is a token of wonderful constancy; also this word
   sleep noteth a meek kind of death. Now, because he made this prayer
   when he was at the point of death, he was not moved with any hope of
   obtaining pardon, to be so careful to appease his enemies, but only
   that they might repent. When this word sleep is taken in the Scripture
   for to die, it must be referred unto the body, lest any man imagine
   foolishly with unlearned men, that the souls do also sleep.

   CHAPTER 8

   In this history we may first see the state of the godly in this world,
   to wit, that they are like sheep appointed to be slain, as it is in the
   Psalm, (Psalm 44:22;) and especially when the Lord letteth loose the
   bridle to his enemies, that they may put that cruelty in execution
   which they have in mind conceived. Secondly, here is set down the end
   of persecutions, to wit, that they are so far from breaking off the
   course of the gospel, that they are rather made helps to further the
   same through the wonderful counsel of God. Like as it was a manifest
   miracle, that the scattering abroad, mentioned by Luke, gathered many
   unto the unity of faith who were estranged from God before. Now, let us
   consider every thing in order.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 8:1-4

   1. And at that day there was great persecution raised against the
   church which was at Jerusalem. Therefore they were all scattered abroad
   throughout all regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. 2.
   And religious men dressed Stephen together, and they mourned sore for
   him. 3. But Saul made havock of the church, and, entering into houses,
   and drawing thence men and women, he cast them into prison. 4. And they
   being dispersed, did go about preaching the word of God.


   1. At that day. The persecution began at Stephen, after that, when
   their madness was thereby set on fire, it waxed hot against all, both
   one and other. For the wicked are like brute beasts, for when they have
   once tasted blood they are more desirous thereof, and become more cruel
   through committing murder. For Satan, who is the father of all cruelty,
   doth first take from them all feeling of humanity when they are once
   imbrued with innocent blood; that done, he stirreth up in them an
   unquenchable thirsting after blood, whence those violent assaults to
   commit murder come; so that when they have once begun, they will never
   make an end with their will. Moreover, when they have power once
   granted them to do hurt, their boldness increaseth in tract of time, so
   that they are carried headlong more immoderately, which thing Luke also
   noteth when he saith, The persecution was great. Undoubtedly the Church
   had but small rest before, neither was it free from the vexation of the
   wicked; but the Lord spared his for a time, that they might have some
   liberty, and now they began to be sorer set on.

   These things must be applied unto our time also. If the furiousness of
   our enemies seem at any time to be as it were fallen on sleep, so that
   it casteth not out flames far, let us know that the Lord provideth for
   our weakness; yet, let us not in the mean season imagine that we shall
   have continual truce, but let us be in readiness to suffer sorer
   brunts, as often as they shall break out suddenly. Let us also
   remember, that if at any time the constancy of one man have whetted the
   cruelty of our enemies, the blame of the evil is unjustly ascribed to
   him. For Luke doth not defame Stephen, [494] when as he saith, that by
   means of him the Church was sorer vexed than before; but he rather
   turneth this to his praise, because he did valiantly, as the
   standard-bearer, encourage others with his example to fight
   courageously. When he calleth it the Church which was at Jerusalem, his
   meaning is not that there were Churches elsewhere, but he passeth over
   unto these things which ensued thereupon. For whereas there was but
   this one only body of the godly in all the world, it was rent in pieces
   through flight; yet there sprung up more Churches by and by of those
   lame members which were dispersed here and there, and so the body of
   Christ was spread abroad far and wide, whereas it was before shut up
   within the walls of Jerusalem,

   They were all scattered abroad. It is certain that they were not all
   scattered abroad, but the Scripture useth an universal note, for that
   which we say, Every where or abroad. [495] The sum is this, that not
   only a few were in danger; because the cruelty of the enemies raged
   throughout the whole Church. Many do oftentimes take themselves to
   their feet, through faintness of heart, even when they hear any light
   rumor, but these are in another case. For they fled not unadvisedly,
   being discouraged, [496] but because they saw no other means to pacify
   the fury of the adversaries. And he saith, that they were scattered not
   only through divers places of Judea, but that they came even unto
   Samaria; so that the middle wall began to be pulled down, which made
   division between the Jews and the Gentiles, (Ephesians 2:14.) For the
   conversion of Samaria was, as it were, the first fruits of the calling
   of the Gentiles. For although they had circumcision, as had the people
   of God, yet we know that there was great dissension, and that not
   without great cause, forasmuch as they had in Samaria only a forged
   worship of God, as Christ affirmeth, because it was only an unsavory
   emulation. [497] Therefore God set open the gate for the gospel then,
   that the scepter of Christ, sent out of Jerusalem, might come unto the
   Gentiles. He exempteth the apostles out of this number, not that they
   were free from the common danger, but because it is the duty of a good
   pastor to set himself against the invasions of wolves for the safety of
   his flock.

   But here may a question be asked, forasmuch as they were commanded to
   preach the gospel throughout the whole world, (Mark 16:16,) why they
   stayed at Jerusalem, even when they were expelled thence with force and
   hand? I answer, that seeing Christ had commanded them to begin at
   Jerusalem, they employed themselves there until such time as being
   brought into some other place by his hand, they might know, for a
   surety, that he was their guide. And we see how fearfully they
   proceeded to preach the gospel; not that they foreslowed [shunned] that
   function which was enjoined them, but because they were amazed at a new
   and unwonted thing. Therefore, seeing they see the gospel so mightily
   resisted at Jerusalem, they dare go to no other place until such time
   as they have broken that first huge heap of straits. Assuredly, they
   provide neither for their ease, nor yet for their own commodities
   either for being void of care by staying at Jerusalem; for they have a
   painful charge, they are continually amidst divers dangers they
   encounter with great troubles. Wherefore, undoubtedly, they are
   purposed to do their duty; and especially, whereas they stand to it
   when all the rest fly, that is an evident testimony of valiant
   constancy. If any man object that they might have divided the provinces
   amongst them, that they might not all have been occupied in one place,
   I answer, that Jerusalem alone had business enough for them all.

   In sum, Luke reckoneth up this as a thing worthy of praise, that they
   followed not the rest into voluntary exile to avoid persecution; and
   yet he doth not reprehend the flight of those men whose state was more
   free. For the apostles did consider what particular thing their calling
   had; to wit, that they should keep their standing, seeing the wolves
   did invade the sheepfold. The rigor of Tertullian, and such like, was
   too great, who did deny indifferently that it is lawful to fly for fear
   of persecution. Augustine saith better, who giveth leave to fly in such
   sort that the churches, being destitute of their pastors, be not
   betrayed into the hands of the enemies. This is surely the best
   moderation, which beareth neither too much with the flesh, neither
   driveth those headlong to death who may lawfully save their lives. Let
   him that is disposed read the 180th Epistle to Honoratus.

   That I may return to the apostles, if they had been scattered here and
   there with fear of persecution, even at the beginning, all men might
   have rightly called them hirelings. How hurtful and filthy had the
   forsaking of the place been at the present time? How greatly would it
   have discouraged the minds of all men? What great hurt should they have
   done with their example among the posterity? It shall sometimes so fall
   out indeed, that the pastor may also fly; that is, if they invade him
   alone, if the laying waste of the Church be not feared if he be absent.
   [498] But and if both his flock and he have to encounter with the
   adversary, he is a treacherous forsaker of his office if he stand not
   stoutly to it even until the end. Private persons have greater liberty.

   2. They dressed Stephen. Luke showeth, that even in the heat of
   persecution the godly were not discouraged, but being always zealous,
   they did those duties which did belong to godliness. Burial seemeth to
   be a matter of small importance; rather than they will foreslow
   [neglect] the same, they bring themselves in no small hazard of life.
   And as the circumstance of time doth declare, that they contemned death
   valiantly, so again, we gather thereby that they were careful to do
   this thing not without great and urgent cause. For this served greatly
   to exercise their faith, that the body of the holy martyr should not be
   left to the wild beasts, in whom Christ had triumphed nobly according
   to the glory of his gospel. Neither could they live to Christ, unless
   they were ready to be gathered unto Stephen into the society of death.
   Therefore the care they had to bury the martyr was unto them a
   meditation unto invincible constancy of professing the faith. Therefore
   they sought not in a superfluous matter, with an unadvised zeal, to
   provoke their adversaries. Although that general reason, which ought
   always and every where to be of force amongst the godly, was
   undoubtedly of great weight with them. For the rite of burying doth
   appertain unto the hope of the resurrection, as it was ordained by God
   since the beginning of the world to this end.

   Wherefore, this was always counted cruel barbarism to suffer bodies to
   lie unburied willingly. Profane men did not know why they should
   account the rite of burial so holy; but we are not ignorant of the end
   thereof, to wit, that those which remain alive may know that the bodies
   are committed to the earth as to a prison, [499] until they be raised
   up thence. Whereby it appeareth that this duty is profitable rather for
   those which are alive than those which are dead. Although it is also a
   point of our humanity to give due honor to those bodies to which we
   know blessed immortality to be promised.

   They made great lamentation. Luke doth also commend their profession of
   godliness and faith in their lamentation. For a doleful and
   unprosperous end causeth men, for the most part, to forsake those
   causes wherein they were delighted before. But, on the other side,
   these men declare by their mourning, that they are no whit terrified
   with the death of Stephen from standing stoutly in the approbation of
   their cause; considering therewithal what great loss God's Church
   suffered by the death of one man. And we must reject that foolish
   philosophy which willeth all men to be altogether blockish that they
   may be wise. It must needs be that the Stoics were void of common sense
   who would have a man to be without all affection. Certain mad fellows
   would gladly bring in the same dotings into the Church at this day, and
   yet, notwithstanding, although they require an heart of iron of other
   men, there is nothing softer or more effeminate than they. They cannot
   abide that other men should shed one tear; if anything fall out
   otherwise than they would wish, they make no end of mourning. God doth
   thus punish their arrogancy jestingly, (that I may so term it,) seeing
   that he setteth them to be laughed at even by boys. But let us know
   that those affections which God hath given to man's nature are, of
   themselves, no more corrupt than the author himself; but that they are
   first to be esteemed according to the cause; secondly, if they keep a
   mean and moderation. Surely that man which denieth that we ought to
   rejoice over the gifts of God is more like a block than a man;
   therefore, we may no less lawfully sorrow when they be taken away. And
   lest I pass the compass of this present place, Paul doth not altogether
   forbid men mourning, when any of their friends are taken away by death,
   but he would have a difference between them and the unbelievers;
   because hope ought to be to them a comfort and a remedy against
   impatience. For the beginning of death caused us to sorrow for good
   causes; but because we know that we have life restored to us in Christ,
   we have that which is sufficient to appease our sorrow. In like sort,
   when we are sorry that the Church is deprived of rare and excellent
   men, there is good cause of sorrow; only we must seek such comfort as
   may correct excess.

   3. But Saul. We must note two things in this place, how great the
   cruelty of the adversaries was, and how wonderful the goodness of God
   was, who vouchsafed to make Paul a pastor of so cruel a wolf. For that
   desire to lay waste the Church wherewith he was incensed did seem to
   cut away all hope. Therefore his conversion was so much the more
   excellent afterward. And it is not to be doubted but that this
   punishment was laid upon him by God, after that he had conspired to put
   Stephen to death, together with the other wicked men, that he should be
   the ringleader of cruelty. For God doth oftentimes punish sins more
   sharply in the elect than in the reprobate.

   4. And they were scattered abroad. Luke declareth in this place also,
   that it came to pass by the wonderful providence of God, that the
   scattering abroad of the faithful should bring many unto the unity of
   faith; thus doth the Lord use to bring light out of darkness, and life
   out of death. For the voice of the gospel, which was heard heretofore
   in one place only, doth now sound everywhere; in the mean season, we
   are taught by this example that we must not yield unto persecutions,
   but rather be encouraged unto valiantness; for, when the faithful flee
   from Jerusalem, they are not afterward discouraged either with exile or
   with their present miseries, or with any fear, that they degenerate
   into slothfulness; [500] but they are as ready to preach Christ even in
   the midst of their calamity as if they had never suffered any trouble.
   Moreover, Luke seemeth to note that they led a wandering life in that
   they changed their lodgings often. Therefore, if we desire to be
   counted their brethren, let us prick forward ourselves so diligently,
   that no fear or bitterness of cross discourage us, but that we go
   forward in showing forth the profession of faith; and that we never be
   weary of furthering the doctrine of Christ; for it is an absurd thing
   that exile and flight, which are the first exercises of martyrdom,
   should make us dumb and fainthearted.

   Acts 8:5-13

   5. And when Philip came into the city of Samaria, he preached Christ to
   them. 6. And the multitude gave ear to those things which Philip spake,
   hearing with one consent, and seeing the signs which he showed. 7. For
   whereas many were possessed with unclean spirits, they came out, crying
   with a loud voice; and many that had the palsy, and which were lame,
   were healed; 8. So that there was great joy in that city. 9. And a man,
   named Simon, had been before in the city, exercising the art magic, and
   bewitching the people of Samaria, saying that he was some great man:
   10. To whom they all gave heed, both small and great, saying, This man
   is the great power of God. 11. And they had given heed unto him,
   because they had been bewitched long time with his witchcraft. 12. But
   as soon as they believed Philip preaching concerning the kingdom of
   God, and in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and
   women. 13. And Simon himself believed, and being baptized, did cleave
   to Philip; and when he saw the signs and great powers which were done,
   he wondered.


   5. Luke said that they all preached the Word of God, now he maketh
   mention of Philip alone, both because his preaching was more fruitful
   and effectual than the preaching of the rest, and also because there
   followed notable histories, which he will add afterward. He put the
   city of Samaria for the city Samaria which was laid waste by Hyrcanus,
   and built again by Herod, and called Sebaste. Read Josephus, in his
   Thirteenth and Fifteenth Books of Antiquities. When he saith that
   Philip preached Christ, he signifieth that the whole sum of the gospel
   is contained in Christ. The other speech which he useth shortly after
   is more perfect; yet it all one in effect. He joineth the kingdom of
   God and the name of Christ together; but because we obtain this
   goodness through Christ, to have God to reign in us, and to lead an
   heavenly life, being renewed into spiritual righteousness, and dead to
   the world, therefore the preaching of Christ containeth this point also
   under it. But the sum is this, that Christ doth repair with his grace
   the world, being destroyed; which cometh to pass when he reconcileth us
   to the Father. Secondly, when he regenerateth us by his Spirit, that
   the kingdom of God may be erected in us when Satan is put to flight.
   Moreover, whereas he declared before, that the apostles did not stir
   one foot from Jerusalem, it is to be thought that he speaketh of one of
   the seven deacons in this place, whose daughters did also prophesy.

   6. And the multitude gave ear. Luke declareth how the Samaritans did
   embrace Philip's doctrine. For he saith that they heard, whereby they
   took some taste; there was also another prick whereby they were pricked
   forward, and that was miracles; at length there followed attentiveness.
   This is the right going forward unto faith; for those which refuse that
   doctrine which they have not heard, how is it possible that they should
   ever come unto faith, which cometh by hearing? (Romans 10:14.)
   Therefore, whereas they were ready to hear, that was the first step
   unto reverence and attentiveness. And therefore it is no marvel if
   faith be so rare, and almost none in the world; for how many be there
   which vouchsafe to hearken when God speaketh? whereby it cometh to pass
   that the more part rejecteth the truth before they know the same, and
   have not so much as lightly tasted it. And as hearing is the beginning
   of faith, so it should not be sufficient of itself, unless the majesty
   of doctrine should also move the hearts. And surely, whosoever
   considereth that he hath to do with God, cannot hear him contemptuously
   when he speaketh; and the very doctrine which is contained in his word
   shall purchase authority for itself, so that attentiveness shall flow
   of itself from hearing. As touching miracles we know that there is a
   double use thereof; they serve to prepare us to hear the gospel, and to
   confirm us in the faith thereof. The adverb, with one accord, may be
   joined as well with hearing as with attentiveness. This latter doth
   like me better, that they were attentive with one accord; and therein
   doth Luke commend the force and efficacy of Philip's preaching, because
   a great number of men was suddenly won to hear attentively with one
   consent.

   7. Unclean spirits. He toucheth certain kinds briefly, that we may know
   with what miracles they [501] were brought to attribute any authority
   to Philip. That crying wherewith the unclean spirits cried was a token
   of resistance. Wherefore this served not a little to set forth the
   power of Christ, that he did bind the devils with his commandment,
   though they resisted stubbornly.

   8. The joy whereof he speaketh is a fruit of faith. For it cannot be
   but that so soon as we know that God will be favorable and merciful our
   minds shall be wrapt with incomparable joy, and such as doth far pass
   all understanding, (Philippians 4:7.)

   9. A certain man named Simon. This was such a let that it might seem
   that the gospel could have no passage to come unto the Samaritans; for
   the minds of them all were bewitched with Simon's jugglings. And this
   amazedness was grown to some strength by reason of long space of time.
   Furthermore experience teacheth what a hard matter it is to pluck that
   error out of the minds of men which hath taken root through long
   continuance and to call them back unto a sound and right mind who are
   already hardened. Superstition made them more obstinate in their error,
   because they counted Simon not only as a prophet of God, but even as
   the Spirit of God.

   10. For the surname, great power, tendeth to this end, that whatsoever
   should otherwise be divine might wax vile through this greatness.
   Therefore the power of Christ appeareth hereby more plainly, in that
   Philip brake through these lets; which thing Luke amplifieth,

   11. When he saith that they were astonied, from the least to the
   greatest. For seeing all men, of what estate soever they were, were
   deluded, what entrance could the gospel have, especially since it was
   no mean seducing? for all their senses were besotted. And besides that
   we see thereby how mighty the truth is, there is also set before us an
   example of constancy in Philip, who, though he saw no way, yet doth he
   set hand to the Lord's work with a valiant courage, waiting for the
   success which God should give. And thus must we do, we must valiantly
   attempt whatsoever the Lord commandeth, even when our endeavors seem to
   be vain. Furthermore, whereas Satan did bewitch the Samaritans, let us
   know that it is the common punishment of infidelity. All men are not
   bewitched, indeed, with the jugglings of enchanters, neither are there
   Simons everywhere, which can so seduce and deceive; but my meaning is,
   that it is no wonder, [502] if Satan do mock men diversely in the dark;
   for they are subject to all errors whosoever are not governed by the
   Spirit of God. Furthermore, when Luke saith that they were all seduced
   one with another, we are taught that neither wit, neither all that
   reason and wisdom which we have, are sufficient to avoid the craftiness
   of Satan withal. And surely we see in what foolish and doting errors
   they were entangled, who were counted in the world wiser than others.

   The great power of God. Therefore Satan abused the name of God to
   deceive, which is the most pestilent kind of deceiving, so far is it
   from being any excuse. It hath been said before, that Simon did take to
   himself the name of the principal power of God, that he might suppress
   and surpass whatsoever was elsewhere divine, as the sun darkeneth all
   the stars with his light. This was wicked and ungodly profaning of the
   name of God. But we read of nothing which was done here, which is not
   done as yet daily; for men are bent to nothing more than to translate
   that to Satan which is proper to God. They pretend religion; but what
   did this pretense help the Samaritans? Therefore it goeth well with us
   when God setteth forth to us his power in Christ, and declareth
   therewith that we must not seek the same anywhere else, and doth
   discover the sleights and juggling casts of Satan, which we must avoid,
   to the end he may keep us still in himself.

   12. When they had believed. That is the miracle whereof I spake because
   they heard Philip, who were altogether made astonied with the illusions
   of Simon; in that they were made partakers of the heavenly wisdom who
   were blockish and dull. So that they were, after a sort, brought from
   hell to heaven. Whereas baptism followed faith, it agreeth with
   Christ's institution, as concerning strangers, (Mark 16:47 [sic],) and
   those which were without. For it was meet that they should be engrafted
   into the body of the Church before they should receive the sign; but
   the Anabaptists are too foolish, whilst they endeavor to prove by these
   places that infants are not to be baptized. Men and women could not be
   baptized without making confession of their faith; but they were
   admitted unto baptism upon this condition, that their families might
   [503] be consecrated to God; for the covenant goeth thus:

   "I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed,"
   (Genesis 17:7.)

   13. Simon also himself. He which had besotted the whole city with his
   witchery receiveth the truth together with others. He which had boasted
   himself to be the principal power of God submitteth himself to God,
   [Christ; ] though he were brought to the knowledge of the gospel, not
   so much for his own sake alone, as for the whole country's sake, that
   that offense might be taken out of the way which might have hindered
   the unskillful. And to this end tendeth that which Luke setteth down
   afterward, that he wondered at the signs. For God meant to triumph over
   this man, whom the Samaritans counted a petit God; [504] which cometh
   to pass whilst he is enforced to give glory to the true miracles, after
   that his vain boasting is taken away. And yet he giveth not himself
   over sincerely to Christ; for then his ambition, and that wicked and
   profane account which he made of the gifts of God, should not break
   out. And yet I am not of their mind who think that he made only a
   semblance of faith, seeing he did not believe. Luke saith plainly that
   he believed, and the reason is added, Because he was touched with
   wondering. How, then, doth he shortly after betray himself to be but a
   hypocrite? I answer, That there is some mean between faith and mere
   dissimulation. The Epicures [Epicureans] and Lucianists do profess that
   they believe, whereas notwithstanding they laugh inwardly, whereas the
   hope of eternal life is unto them a vain thing; finally, whereas they
   have no more godliness than dogs or swine.

   But there be many who howsoever they be not regenerate with the Spirit
   of adoption, and do not addict themselves unto God with the true
   affection of the heart, being overcome with the power of the Word, do
   not only confess that that is true which is taught, but are also
   touched with some fear of God, so that they receive doctrine; for they
   conceive that God must be heard; that he is both the author and also
   the judge of the world. Therefore, they make no semblance of faith
   before men, which is none, but they think that they believe. And this
   faith continueth only for a time, whereof Christ speaketh in Mark,
   (Mark 4; Luke 8:13;) to wit, when the seed of the Word conceived in the
   mind is, notwithstanding, choked forthwith with divers cares of the
   world, or with wicked affections, so that it never cometh to any
   ripeness; yea, rather, it groweth out of kind unto unprofitable corn
   nothing worth. Such, therefore, was Simon's faith; he perceiveth that
   the doctrine of the gospel is true, and he is enforced to receive the
   same with the feeling of his conscience; but the groundwork is wanting;
   that is, the denial of himself. Whereupon it followed that his mind was
   enwrapped in dissimulation, which he uttereth forthwith. But let us
   know that his hypocrisy was such as he deceived himself in; and not
   that gross hypocrisy whereof Epicures and such like make boast; [505]
   because they dare not confess the contempt of God.

   He was baptized. It appeareth plainly, by this example of Simon that
   all men have not that grace given them in baptism, which grace is there
   figured. The opinion of the Papists is this, That unless mortal sin be
   the cause of let, [506] all men receive the truth and effect with the
   signs. So that they attribute unto the sacraments magical force, as if
   they did profit without faith, But let us know that the Lord offereth
   to us by the sacraments, whatsoever the annexed promises do sound;
   [507] and that they are not offered in vain, so that [508] being
   directed unto Christ by faith, we set [seek] from him whatsoever the
   sacraments do promise. And although the receiving of baptism did profit
   him nothing then, yet if conversion followed afterward, as some men
   suppose, the profit was not extinguished nor abolished. For it cometh
   to pass oftentimes that the Spirit of God worketh afterward after a
   long time, that the sacraments may begin to show forth their force.
   [509]

   Did cleave to Philip. Whereas Philip admitted him into his company, it
   appeareth thereby how hard a matter it is to know hypocrites. And this
   is a trial of our patience. So Demas was a companion of Paul for a
   time; afterward he became an unfaithful revolt [510] (2 Timothy 4:10,)
   Finally, we cannot escape this evil, but that wicked men and deceitful
   will sometimes join themselves unto us; and if at any time the wicked
   creep craftily into our company, proud censors burden us unjustly, as
   if we were to answer for their misdeeds. Though we must take heed of
   facility, which causeth the gospel to be slandered oftentimes, and we
   must be so much the more vigilant, that we admit none without great
   choice, forasmuch as we hear that great men have been deceived. He
   saith that he was made astonied with the greatness of the signs; that
   we may know that that great power, whereof he boasted, was nothing else
   but juggling and smokes. And Luke speaketh not in this place of any
   plain wondering, but of a damp or trance which causeth a man to forget
   what he doth. [511]

   Acts 8:14-17

   14. And when the apostles which were at Jerusalem had heard that
   Samaria had received the Word of God, they sent unto them Peter and
   John: 15. Who, when they were come down, they prayed for them, that
   they might receive the Holy Ghost: 16. For he was not as yet come down
   upon any of them; but they were only baptized in the name of Christ
   Jesus. 17. Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the
   Holy Ghost.


   14. Luke describeth, in this place, the proceedings of the grace of God
   in the Samaritans, as he useth to enrich the faithful continually with
   greater gifts of his Spirit, for we must not think that the apostles
   took that counsel whereof Luke speaketh, without the instinct of the
   same God who had already begun his work in Samaria by the hand of
   Philip; and he useth his instruments diversely unto divers parts of his
   work, according to his good pleasure. He used Philip as an instrument
   to bring them unto the faith; now he ordaineth Peter and John to be
   ministers to give the Spirit and thus doth he foster the unity of his
   Church when one helpeth another, and not only knit man and man
   together, but whole churches also. He could have finished that which he
   had begun by Philip; but to the end the Samaritans might learn to
   embrace brotherly fellowship with the first Church, he meant to bind
   them herewith as with a band; secondly, he meant to grant the apostles
   (whom he had commanded to preach the gospel throughout the whole world
   -- Mark 16:15) this privilege, that they might the better all grow
   together into one faith of the gospel; and we know that it was
   otherwise dangerous, lest, seeing the Jews and Samaritans were much
   unlike in mind and manners, being so divided, they should by this means
   divide Christ, or at least feign to themselves a new Church.

   In the mean season, we see how careful the apostles were to help their
   brethren; for they stay not until they be requested, but they take this
   charge upon them of their own accord. The apostles do not this through
   any distrust, as if they did suspect that Philip did not his duty so
   uprightly as he ought; [512] but they set to their hand to help him in
   his work, and Peter and John came not only to help him, and to be
   partakers of his labors, but also to approve the same. Again, Philip is
   not grieved because other men finish that building which he had begun,
   but they one help another full gently and faithfully; and surely it is
   ambition alone which will not suffer holy fellowship and mutual
   imparting of duties to enter. [513] Whereas Luke saith that Peter was
   sent by the rest, we may hereby gather that he was not the chief ruler
   over his fellows in office; [514] but did so excel amongst them, that
   yet, notwithstanding, he was subject to, and did obey the body.

   Which were at Jerusalem. This may carry a double meaning, either that
   all the apostles were at Jerusalem then, or that there were certain
   resident there when the rest went hither and thither; and I do rather
   allow this latter, for it is to be thought that they did so divide
   themselves, that always some of the number might take upon them divers
   embassages, as occasion was offered, that some might stay at Jerusalem,
   as in the principal standing. [515] Again, it may be that after every
   man had spent some time in his voyage, they were wont to assemble
   themselves there. It is certain, indeed, that that time which they
   spent at Jerusalem was not spent in idleness; and, secondly that they
   were not tied to some one place, forasmuch as Christ had commanded them
   to go over all the world (Mark 16:15.)

   15. They prayed. Undoubtedly they taught first, for we know that they
   were no dumb persons; but Luke passeth over that which was common to
   them and Philip, and declareth only what new thing the Samaritans had
   by their coming, to wit, that they had the Spirit given them then.

   16. But here ariseth a question, for he saith that they were only
   baptized into the name of Christ, and that therefore they had not as
   yet received the Holy Ghost; but baptism must either be in vain and
   without grace, or else it must have all the force which it hath from
   the Holy Ghost. In baptism we are washed from our sins; but Paul
   teacheth that our washing is the work of the Holy Ghost, (Titus 3:5.)
   The water used in baptism is a sign of the blood of Christ; but Peter
   saith, that it is the Spirit by whom we are washed with the blood of
   Christ (1 Peter 1:2.) Our old man is crucified in baptism, that we may
   be raised up unto newness of life, (Romans 6:6;) and whence cometh all
   this save only from the sanctification of the Spirit? And, finally,
   what shall remain in baptism if it be separate from the Spirit?
   (Galatians 3:27.) Therefore, we must not deny but that the Samaritans,
   who had put on Christ, indeed, in baptism, had also his Spirit given
   them; and surely Luke speaketh not in this place of the common grace of
   the Spirit, whereby God doth regenerate us, that we may be his
   children, but of those singular gifts wherewith God would have certain
   endued at the beginning of the gospel to beautify Christ's kingdom.
   Thus must the words of John be understood, that the disciples had not
   the Spirit given them as yet, forasmuch as Christ was yet conversant in
   the world; not that they were altogether destitute of the Spirit,
   seeing that they had from the same both faith, and a godly desire to
   follow Christ; but because they were not furnished with those excellent
   gifts, wherein appeared afterwards greater glory of Christ's kingdom.
   To conclude, forasmuch as the Samaritans were already endtied with the
   Spirit of adoptioni the excellent graces of the Spirit are heaped upon
   them, in which God showed to his Church, for a time as it were, the
   visible presence of his Spirit, that he might establish for ever the
   authority of his gospel, and also testify that his Spirit shall be
   always the governor and director of the faithful.

   They were only baptized. We must not understand this as spoken
   contemptuously of baptism; but Luke's meaning is, that they were only
   endued then with the grace of common adoption and regeneration, which
   is offered to all the godly in baptism. As for this, it was an
   extraordinary thing that certain should have the gifts of the Spirit
   given them, which might serve to set forth the kingdom of Christ and
   the glory of the gospel; for this was the use thereof, that every one
   might profit the Church according to the measure of his ability. We
   must note this, therefore, because, while the Papists will set up their
   feigned confirmation, they are not afraid to break out into this
   sacrilegious speech, that they are but half Christians upon whom the
   hands have not been as yet laid. This is not tolerable now because,
   whereas this was a sign which lasted only for a time, they made it a
   continual law in the Church, as if they had the Spirit in readiness to
   give to whomsoever they would. We know that when the testimony and
   pledge of God's grace is set before us in vain, and without the thing
   itself, it is too filthy mockery; but even they themselves are enforced
   to grant that the Church was beautified for a time only with these
   gifts; whereupon it followeth that the laying on of hands which the
   apostles used had an end when the effect ceased. I omit that, that they
   added oil unto the laying on of hands, (Mark 6:13;) but this, as I have
   already said, was a point of too great boldness, to prescribe a
   perpetual law to the Church, that that might be a general sacrament,
   which was peculiarly used amongst the apostles, (Galatians 3:7; Romans
   6:6;) that the sign might continue still after that the thing itself
   was ceased; and with this they joined detestable blasphemy, because
   they said that sins were only forgiven by baptism, and that the Spirit
   of regeneration is given by that rotten oil which they presumed to
   bring in without the Word of God. The Scripture doth testify that we
   put on Christ in baptism, and that we are engrafted into his body, that
   our old man may be crucified, and we renewed into righteousness. These
   sacrilegious robbers have translated that to adorn the false visor of
   their sacrament which they have taken from baptism. [516] Neither was
   this the invention of one man only, but the decree of one council,
   whereof they babble daily in all their schools.

   17. When they had laid their hands. The laying on of hands followeth
   prayers, whereby they testify that the grace of the Spirit is not
   included in the external ceremony, which they crave humbly at the hands
   of another. And yet when they confess that God is the author, they
   neglect not the ceremony which was delivered them by God to this use;
   and because they usurp it not rashly, the effect is also annexed. This
   is the profit and efficacy of signs, because God worketh in them, and
   yet he remaineth the only giver of grace and distributeth the same
   according to his good pleasure; but let us remember that the laying on
   of hands was the instrument of God, at such time as he gave the visible
   graces of the Spirit to his, and that since the Church was deprived of
   such riches, it is only a vain visor without any substance. [517]

   Acts 8:18-25

   18. And when Simon saw that the Holy Ghost was given by the laying on
   of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, 19. Saying, Give me also
   this power, that on whom I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy
   Ghost. 20. And Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
   thou hast thought that the gift of God is obtained with money. 21. Thou
   hast no part nor inheritance in this business; for thy heart is not
   right before God. 22. Therefore repent of this wickedness, and pray
   unto God, if peradventure the cogitation of thy heart may be forgiven
   thee. 23. For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the
   bond of unrighteousness. 24. And Simon answering, said, Pray ye for me
   unto God, that none of these things may happen to me which ye have
   said. 25. Then when they had testified and spoken the word of God, they
   returned to Jerusalem, and they preached the gospel in many streets of
   the Samaritans.


   18. And when Simon. Simon's hypocrisy is now discovered, not because
   that he had feigned before that he believed; for when he was convicted
   he gave Christ his hand in earnest, like as many yield unto the gospel,
   lest they strive against God, but in the mean season they continue like
   to themselves; whereas the denial of ourselves ought to follow true
   faith. And this is to mix Christ with Satan, when doctrine pierceth not
   unto the hidden affections of the heart, but the inward uncleanness
   lieth hidden there. [518] Therefore God wipeth away that false color
   now in Simon, lest by professing the name of Christ he deceive both
   himself and others. For that ambition which was hidden before breaketh
   out now, when as he desireth to be equal with the apostles. This is now
   one vice; another is, because while he thinketh that the grace of God
   is to be sold, he will get some greedy gain thereby. [519] Whereby it
   appeareth that he is a profane man, and such as had not tasted the
   first principles of godliness; for he is touched with no desire of
   God's glory; yea, he doth not once think what it is to be a minister of
   God. As he had heretofore gotten gain by his magic, so he thought that
   it would be gainsome if he might give the graces of the Spirit. For
   undoubtedly he hunted after riches, and sought to purchase praise in
   the sight of the world; and he did God great injury also, because he
   thought that this heavenly power did nothing differ from his magical
   enchantments. Now we understand briefly what and how many ways Simon
   offended. In the gifts of the Spirit he doth not adore, neither
   acknowledge the power of Christ; he doth not confess that the apostles
   were endued with heavenly power, to set forth Christ's glory by their
   ministry; his own ambition driveth and carrieth him headlong, so that
   he desireth to become excellent; and to make the world subject to
   himself, setting God apart, he will buy the Holy Ghost, as if he could
   be bought with money.

   20. Peter answered. Peter giveth him the repulse here stoutly, and
   being not content to chide him, he addeth a bitter curse (or wish,)
   that Simon and his money may perish together; though he doth not so
   much wish unto him destruction, as he telleth him that the just
   vengeance of God hangeth over his head, that he might terrify him. In
   sum, he showeth what he hath deserved, when he hath made the Spirit of
   God subject to filthy buying and selling; as if he should have said,
   Thou art worthy to perish with thy money, [520] when thou dost so
   blaspheme the Spirit of God. For we may easily gather by that which
   followeth, that Peter would rather have had Simon saved than destroyed.
   But as it were supplying the place of a judge, he pronounceth what
   punishment Simon's ungodliness deserveth; and it was requisite that he
   should be thus accused with such vehemence, that he might perceive the
   greatness of his offense. [521] To the same end tendeth that that he
   judged his money to perish; for he signifieth that it was as it were
   infected and polluted with cogitation of wickedness, because it was
   offered to such a wicked use. And surely we ought rather to wish that
   all the whole world perish, than that those things should darken the
   glory of God, which, in comparison thereof, are nothing worth. When he
   wisheth thus to a sacrilegious man, he doth not so much respect the
   person as the fact; for we must be offended with the offenses of men in
   such sort, that we must pity the men themselves. Such are those
   sentences of God which adjudge adulterers, thieves, drunkards, and
   wrongful dealers, to destruction, (1 Corinthians 6:9; Ephesians 5:5;)
   for they do not cut off all hope of salvation from them, but they are
   only referred unto their present state and declare what end is prepared
   for them, if they go forward obstinately.

   21. Thou hast no part. Some do frame this sentence otherwise, that
   Simon is not partaker of grace, because he setteth a price thereof. But
   the other reading which we have followed is more usual, to wit, that
   that reason be joined to the former member. And surely it is better to
   knit the two sentences together, thus, Thy money perish with thee,
   because thou thinkest that the inestimable gift of the Spirit can be
   bought with money. Whereas the old interpreter had put, in this word;
   Erasmus translated it more fitly, in this business; for Peter's meaning
   is, that that sacrilegious person hath nothing to do in all that
   administration, who doth wickedly profane the same.

   Furthermore both the Papists, and also the old divines, have disputed
   much concerning simony; but that which the Papists call simony doth not
   agree with Simon's fact. Simon would have bought the grace of the
   Spirit with money; the Papists apply the crime of simony unto their
   idle revenues; and yet I speak not this that I may extenuate those
   horrible sins which reign at this day in Popery, in buying and selling
   spiritual promotions. Now, this wickedness is filthy enough of itself,
   in that they hold such a mart in the Church of God. And in the mean
   season, we must note the true definition of simony, to wit, that it is
   a wicked buying and selling of the gifts of the Spirit, or some other
   such like thing, whilst that a man abuseth them unto ambition or other
   corruptions. Though I confess that all those imitate Simon who strive
   to attain unto the government of the Church by unlawful means; which
   thing we see committed at this day without shame, as if it were lawful;
   and we can scarce find one priest in all Popery which is not manifestly
   a simoniacal person in this respect; because none can put up his head
   amongst them, [522] but he must creep in by indirect means. Although we
   must confess, (which thing even children see, to our great shame,) that
   this vice is too common even amongst the false professors of the
   gospel.

   But let us remember, first, to the end we may be free from the
   infection of Simon, that the gifts of the Spirit are not gotten with
   money, but that they are given of the free and mere goodness of God,
   and that for the edifying of the Church; that is, that every man may
   study to help his brethren according to the measure of his ability;
   that every man may bestow [523] that about the common good of the
   Church which he hath received; and that the excellency of no man may
   hinder, but that Christ may excel all. Notwithstanding, it may seem a
   marvelous matter, that Peter excludeth Simon from being a partaker of
   the Spirit, as concerning special gifts; because his heart is not right
   before God. For the wickedness of Judas did not let him from having the
   gifts of the Spirit in great measure; neither had the gifts of the
   Spirit been so corrupted amongst the Corinthians, if their heart had
   been right in the sight of God. Therefore that reason which Peter
   allegeth seemeth insufficient; because many men excel oftentimes in the
   gifts of the Spirit, who have an unclean heart. But, first of all,
   there followeth no absurdity, if God give such graces to men which are
   unworthy thereof. Secondly, Peter prescribeth no general rule in this
   place, but because the Church alone is for the most part made partaker
   of the gifts of the Spirit, he pronounceth that Simon, who is a
   stranger to Christ, is unworthy to have the same graces given him,
   (which are bestowed upon the faithful,) as if he were one of God's
   household. Moreover, he had blasphemed those gifts whereof he is
   deprived.

   22. Repent, therefore. Whereas he exhorteth him unto repentance and
   prayer, he putteth him in some hope of pardon thereby; for no man shall
   ever be touched with any desire of repentance, save only he which shall
   believe that God will have mercy upon him; on the other side, despair
   will always carry men headlong unto boldness. Furthermore, the
   Scripture teacheth that God is not called upon aright save only by
   faith. Therefore, we see how Peter raiseth up Simon now unto hope of
   salvation, whom he had thrown down before with the cruel lightnings and
   thunderbolts of words; and yet Simon's sin was no small sin. But, if it
   could be, we ought to pluck men even out of hell.

   Therefore, until such time as even the most wicked men do by manifest
   signs betray themselves to be reprobates, no one of them is to be
   handled so sharply but that remission of sins is to be set before him.
   Yea, we must so deal with those for whom sharp chiding is profitable,
   by reason of their hardness and stubbornness, that we throw them down
   with one hand, and set them on foot with the other; for the Spirit of
   God doth not suffer us to accurse them [524] But Peter seemeth to bring
   him into some fear and doubt, when he saith, if peradventure. And the
   Papists go about to prove by this place and such like, that we must
   pray with doubtful minds; because men may unadvisedly promise
   themselves certain success in their petitions. But we may readily
   answer them; for the word ei ara signifieth as much as if a man should
   say, If by any means thou must obtain pardon of God. Peter useth this
   word, not that he may leave Simon's mind in a perplexity, but that he
   may the more prick him forward to be earnest in prayer. For the very
   difficulty doth not a little serve to stir us up; because when we see
   the thing at hand, we are too careless and sluggish. Therefore Peter
   doth not terrify Simon, that he may overthrow or trouble all hope of
   obtaining in his heart, but putting him in sure hope if he shall crave
   pardon humbly and from his heart, he telleth him only that pardon is
   hard to be gotten, by reason of the greatness of his offense, to the
   end he may provoke him unto ferventness; for it is requisite that we
   may be lightened by faith when we go unto God, yea, that she be the
   mother of prayer.

   23. In the gall of bitterness. Peter doth sharply reprove Simon again,
   and striketh him with God's judgment. For unless he had been compelled
   to descend into himself, he would never have been turned in good
   earnest unto God. For there is nothing more deadly for men which are
   blockish than when we flatter them, or when we do but a little scrape
   the skin, whereas they ought rather to be thrust through. Therefore,
   until such time as a sinner shall conceive sorrow and true heaviness by
   reason of his sin, we must use such severity as may wound his mind;
   otherwise the rotten sore shall be nourished within, which shall by
   little and little consume the man himself. Yet let us always observe
   this mean, that we provide for men's salvation so much as in us lieth.
   Moreover, there be two excellent fine metaphors in Peter's words; the
   one whereof seemeth to be taken out of Moses, where he forbiddeth that
   there be not in us any root, from which springeth gall and wormwood,
   (Deuteronomy 29.) By which speech is noted the inward wickedness of the
   heart; when as it hath so conceived the poison of ungodliness, that
   being therewith infected, it can bring forth nothing but bitterness. To
   the same end tendeth the binding of iniquity: to wit, when the whole
   heart is kept bound and tied by Satan. For it falleth out sometimes
   that men which are otherwise given very godlily, do break out into evil
   works, who have not their heart corrupt inwardly with poison. We know
   that hypocrisy is engendered in man's nature; but when as the Spirit of
   God doth shine, we are so blinded in our vices, that we nourish them
   within as if it were some hidden bundle. Therefore Peter's meaning is,
   that Simon fell not only in one point, but that his very heart root was
   corrupt and bitter; that he fell into Satan's snares not only in one
   kind of sin, but that all his senses were ensnared, so that he was
   wholly given over to Satan, and was become the bond-slave of iniquity.
   In the mean season, we are taught that the greatness of offenses is
   esteemed not so much according to the fact [525] which appeareth, as
   according to the affection of the heart.

   24. Simon answered. Hereby we gather that he did not so take that which
   Peter had threatened unto him, but that he did consider that his
   salvation was sought. And though Peter alone spake, yet he attributeth
   the speech unto all by reason of the consent. Now ariseth a question
   what we ought to think of Simon. The Scripture carrieth us no farther,
   save only unto a conjecture. Whereas he yieldeth when he is reproved,
   and being touched with the feeling of his sin, feareth the judgment of
   God; and that done, flieth unto the mercy of God, and commendeth
   himself to the prayers of the Church; these are assuredly no small
   signs of repentance; therefore we may conjecture that he repented. And
   yet the old writers affirm with one consent, that he was a great enemy
   to Peter afterward, and that he disputed with him by the space of three
   days at Rome. The disputation is also extant in writing under the name
   of Clement, but it hath in it such filthy dotings, that it is a wonder
   that Christian ears can abide to hear them. Again, Augustine, writing
   to Januarius, saith, that there were divers and false rumors spread
   abroad in Rome in his time concerning that matter. Wherefore, nothing
   is more safe than bidding adieu to uncertain opinions, simply to
   embrace that which is set down in the Scriptures. That which we read
   elsewhere of Simon may justly be suspected for many causes.

   25. And they testified. In these words Luke teacheth that Peter and
   John came not only that they might enrich the Samaritans with the gifts
   of the Spirit, but also that they might establish them in the faith
   which they had already received, by approving Philip's doctrine. For
   thus much doth the word testify import; as if he should say, that it
   came to pass by their testimony, that the word of God had full and
   perfect authority, and that the truth was of force, as being well
   testified and authentic. Notwithstanding Luke teaeheth therewithal that
   they were faithful witnesses of God, when he addeth that they uttered
   the word of God. This was, therefore, the sum of the apostles'
   doctrine, faithfully to utter those things which they had learned of
   the Lord, and not their own inventions, or the inventions of any man
   else. He saith, that they did this not only in the city, but also in
   villages. Therefore we see that they were so inflamed to further the
   glory of Christ, that whithersoever they came they had him in their
   mouth. So that the seed of life began to be sown throughout the whole
   region, after that it was preached in the city. [526]

   Acts 8:26-31

   26. And an angel of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise, and go
   toward the south, to the way which goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza;
   it is waste. 27. And when he arose, he went. And, behold, a man, an
   Ethiopian, an eunuch, a man of great authority with Candace, queen of
   Ethiopia, which had the rule of all her treasure, which carne [had
   come] to Jerusalem to worship 28. And as he returned, and sat in his
   chariot, he read Esaias the prophet. 29. And the Spirit said to Philip,
   Draw near, and be thou joined to this chariot. 30. And as Philip ran
   unto it, he heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and he said,
   Understandest thou what thou readest? 31. He said, How can I, unless
   some man direct me? And he requested Philip that he would come up and
   sit with him.


   26. And the angel. Luke passeth over unto a new history, to wit, how
   the gospel came even unto the Ethiopians. For though he reporteth there
   was but one man converted unto the faith of Christ, yet because his
   authority and power was great in all the realm, his faith might spread
   abroad a sweet smell far and wide. For we know that the gospel grew of
   small beginnings; and therein appeared the power of the Spirit more
   plainly, in that one grain of seed did fill a whole country in a small
   space. Philip is first commanded by the angel to go toward the south;
   the angel telleth him not to what end. And thus doth God oftentimes use
   to deal with those that be his, to prove their obedience. He showeth
   what he will have them to do; he commandeth them to do this or that,
   but he keepeth the success hidden with himself. Therefore let us be
   content with the commandment [527] of God alone, although the reason of
   that which he enjoineth, or the fruit of obedience, appear not by and
   by. [528] For although this be not plainly expressed, yet all the
   commandments of God contain a hidden promise, that so often as we obey
   him, all that work which we take in hand must needs fall out well.
   Moreover, this ought to be sufficient for us, that God doth allow our
   studies, when as we take nothing in hand rashly or without his
   commandment. If any man object, that angels come not down daily from
   heaven to reveal unto us what we ought to do, the answer is ready, that
   we are sufficiently taught in the Word of God what we ought to do, and
   that they are never destitute of counsel who ask it of him, [529] and
   submit themselves to the government of the Spirit. Therefore nothing
   doth hinder and keep us back from being ready to follow God, save only
   our own slothfulness and coldness [530] in prayer.

   To the way which goeth down to Gaza. All the learned grant that that is
   called Gaza here which the Hebrews call Haza. Wherefore, Pomponius Mela
   is deceived, who saith that Cambyses, king of Persia, called that city
   by this name, because when he made war against the Egyptians, he had
   his riches laid up there. It is true, indeed, that the Persians call
   treasure or plenty, Gaza; and Luke useth this word shortly after in
   this sense, when as he saith that the eunuch was the chief governor of
   the treasure of Candace; but because that Hebrew word was used before
   such time as Cambyses was born, I do not think but that it was corrupt
   afterwards, the letter h (heth) being changed into g, which thing we
   see was done in all others almost. The epitheton waste is added for
   this cause, because Alexander of Macedonia laid waste that old Gaza.
   Also Luke refuteth those who make Constantinus the builder of the
   second and new Gaza, who affirmeth that it was an hundred and fifty
   years before; but it may be that he beautified and enlarged the city
   after it was built. And all men confess that this new Gaza was situate
   on the seacoast, distant twenty furlongs from the old city.

   27. Behold, a man, an Ethiopian. He calleth him a man, who he saith
   shortly after was an eunuch; but because kings and queens in the East
   were wont to appoint eunuchs over their weighty affairs, thereby it
   came to pass that lords of great power were called generally [531]
   eunuchs, whereas, notwithstanding, they were men. Furthermore, Philip
   findeth indeed, now at length, that he did not obey God in vain.
   Therefore, whosoever committeth the success to God, and goeth on
   forward thither whither he biddeth him, he shall at length try [532]
   that all that falleth out well which is taken in hand at his
   appointment. [533] The name Candace was not the name of one queen only;
   but as all the emperors of Rome were called Caesars,, so the
   Ethiopians, as Pliny withesseth, called their queens Candaces. This
   maketh also unto the matter that the writers of histories report that
   that was a noble and wealthy kingdom, because it may the better be
   gathered by the royalty and power thereof how gorgeous the condition
   and dignity of the eunuch was. The head and principal place [534] was
   Meroe. The profane writers agree with Luke, who report that women used
   to reign there.

   Came [had come] to worship. Hereby we gather that the name of the true
   God was spread far abroad, seeing he had some worshippers in far
   countries. Certes, it must needs be that this man did openly profess
   another worship than his nation; for so great a lord could not come
   into Judea by stealth, and undoubtedly he brought with him a great
   train. And no marvel if there were some everywhere in the East parts
   which worshipped the true God, because that after the people were
   scattered abroad, there was also some smell [535] of the knowledge of
   the true God spread abroad with them throughout foreign countries; yea,
   the banishment [536] of the people was a spreading abroad of true
   godliness. Also, we see that though the Romans did condemn the Jewish
   religion with many cruel edicts, yet could they not bring to pass but
   that many, even on [in] heaps, would profess the same. [537] These were
   certain beginnings [538] of the calling of the Gentiles, until such
   time as Christ, having with the brightness of his coming put away the
   shadows of the law, might take away the difference which was between
   the Jews and the Gentiles; and having pulled down the wall of
   separation, he might gather together from all parts the children of
   God, (Ephesians 2:14.)

   Whereas the eunuch came to Jerusalem to worship, it must not be
   accounted any superstition. He might, indeed, have called [539] upon
   God in his own country, but this man would not omit the exercises which
   were prescribed to the worshippers of God; and, therefore, this was his
   purpose, not only to nourish faith privily [540] in his heart, but also
   to make profession of the same amongst men. And yet, notwithstanding,
   he could not be so divorced [541] from his nation, but that he might
   well know that he should be hated of many. But he made more account of
   the external profession of religion, which he knew God did require,
   than of the favor of men. And if such a small sparkle of the knowledge
   of the law did so shine in him, what a shame were it for us to choke
   the perfect light of the gospel with unfaithful silence? If any do
   object that the sacrifices were even then abrogated, and that now the
   time was come wherein God would be called upon everywhere without
   difference of place, we may easily answer, that those to whom the truth
   of the gospel was not yet revealed, were retained in the shadows of the
   law without any superstition. For whereas it is said that the law was
   abolished by Christ, as concerning the ceremonies, it is thus to be
   understood, that where Christ showeth himself plainly, those rites
   vanish away which prefigured him when he was absent. Whereas the Lord
   suffered the eunuch to come to Jerusalem before he sent him a teacher,
   it is to be thought that it was done for this cause, because it was
   profitable that he should yet be framed by the rudiments of the law,
   that he might be made more apt afterward to receive the doctrine of the
   gospel. And whereas God sent none of the apostles unto him [542] at
   Jerusalem, the cause lieth hid in his secret counsel, unless,
   peradventure, it were done that he might make more account of the
   gospel, as of some treasure found suddenly, and offered unto him
   contrary to hope; or because it was better that Christ should be set
   before him, after that being separated and withdrawn from the external
   pomp of ceremonies and the beholding of the temple, he sought the way
   of salvation quietly at such time as he was at rest. [543]

   28. He read Esaias. The reading of the prophet showeth that the eunuch
   did not worship a God unadvisedly, according to the understanding of
   his own head, whom he had reigned to himself, but whom he knew by the
   doctrine of the law. And surely this is the right way to worship God,
   not to snatch at bare and vain rites, but to adjoin the word thereunto,
   otherwise there shall be nothing but that which cometh by chance and is
   confused. And certainly the form of worshipping prescribed in the law
   differeth nothing from the inventions of men, save only because God
   giveth light there by his word. Therefore, those which are God's
   scholars do worship aright only, that is, those who are taught in his
   school. But he seemeth to lose his labor when he readeth without
   profit. For he confesseth that he cannot understand the prophet's
   meaning, unless he be helped by some other teacher. I answer, as he
   read the prophet with a desire to learn, so he hoped for some fruit,
   and he found it indeed. Therefore, why doth he deny that he can
   understand the place which he had in hand? For because [544] he
   manifestly confesseth his ignorance in darker places. There be many
   things in Isaiah which need no long exposition, as when he preacheth of
   the goodness and power of God, partly that he may invite men unto
   faith, partly that he may exhort and teach them to lead a godly life.
   Therefore, no man shall be so rude an idiot [545] which shall not
   profit somewhat by reading that book, and yet, notwithstanding, he
   shall, peradventure, scarce understand every tenth verse. Such was the
   eunuch's reading. For seeing that, according to his capacity, he
   gathered those things which served to edification, he had some certain
   profit by his studies. Nevertheless, though he were ignorant of many
   things, [546] yet was he not wearied, so that he did cast away the
   book. Thus must we also read the Scriptures. We must greedily, and with
   a prompt mind, receive those things which are plain, and wherein God
   openeth his mind. As for those things which are hid from us, we must
   pass them over until we see greater light. And if we be not wearied
   with reading, it shall at length come to pass that the Scripture shall
   be made more familiar by continual use.

   31. How should I? Most excellent modesty of the eunuch, who doth not
   only permit Philip who was one of the common sort, to question with
   him, but doth also willingly [547] confess his ignorance. And surely we
   must never hope that he will ever show himself apt to be taught who is
   puffed up with the confidence of his own wit. Hereby it eometh to pass
   that the reading of the Scriptures doth profit so few at this day,
   because we can scarce find one amongst a hundred who submitteth himself
   willingly to learn. For whilst all men almost are ashamed to be
   ignorant of that whereof they are ignorant, every man had rather
   proudly nourish his ignorance than seem to be scholar to other men.
   Yea, a great many take upon them haughtily to teach other men.
   Nevertheless, let us remember that the eunuch did so confess his
   ignorance, that yet, notwithstanding, he was one of God's scholars when
   he read the Scripture. This is the true reverence of the Scripture,
   when as we acknowledge that there is that wisdom laid up there which
   surpasseth [548] all our senses; and yet notwithstanding, we do not
   loathe it, but, reading diligently, we depend upon the revelation of
   the Spirit, and desire to have an interpreter given us.

   He prayed Philip that he would come up. This is another token of
   modesty, that he seeketh an interpreter and teacher. He might have
   rejected Philip according to the pride of rich men; for it was a
   certain secret upbraiding of ignorance when Philip said, Understandest
   thou what thou readest? But rich men think that they have great injury
   done them if any man speak homely to them. And, therefore, they break
   out by and by into these speeches, What is that to thee? or, What hast
   thou to do with me? But the eunuch submitteth himself humbly to Philip
   that by him he may be taught. Thus must we be minded if we desire to
   have God to be our teacher, whose Spirit resteth upon the humble and
   meek, (Isaiah 66:2.) And if any man, mistrusting himself, submit
   himself to be taught, the angels shall rather come down from heaven
   [549] than the Lord will suffer us to labor in vain; though (as did the
   eunuch) we must use all helps, which the Lord offereth unto us, for the
   understanding of the Scriptures. Frantic men require inspirations and
   revelations [550] from heaven, and, in the mean season, they contemn
   the minister of God, by whose hand they ought to be governed. Other
   some, which trust too much to their own wit, will vouchsafe to hear no
   man, and they will read no commentaries. But God will not have us to
   despise those helps which he offereth unto us, and he suffereth not
   those to escape scot free which despise the same. And here we must
   remember, that the Scripture is not only given us, but that
   interpreters and teachers are also added, to be helps to us. For this
   cause the Lord sent rather Philip than an angel to the eunuch. For to
   what end served this circuit, that God calleth Philip by the voice of
   the angel, and sendeth not the angel himself forthwith, save only
   because he would accustom us to hear men? This is, assuredly, no small
   commendation of external preaching, that the voice of God soundeth in
   the mouth of men to our salvation, when angels hold their peace.
   Concerning which thing, I will speak more upon the ninth and tenth
   chapters.

   Acts 8:32-35

   32. Furthermore, the sentence of Scripture which he read was this, He
   was led as a sheep to be slain, and as a lamb dumb before the shearer,
   so opened he not his mouth. 33. In his humility his judgment is
   exalted. Who shall declare his generation? because his life is taken
   from the earth. 34. And the eunuch answering Philip said, I pray thee,
   of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other? 35.
   And Philip opening his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached
   Jesus to him.


   32. The sentence of Scripture. It is properly a text or period. Let us
   know that he lighted not upon this place by chance but that it came to
   pass by the wonderful providence of God, that Philip should have a
   proposition or principle from which the whole sum of Christianity might
   be set. [551] Therefore, first, he hath matter of full instruction
   brought to his hand by the secret direction of the Spirit; secondly,
   the form is plainly applied to the ministry of man. This is an
   excellent prophecy of Christ, and above all others to be remembered;
   because Isaiah saith plainly there [552] that such should be the manner
   of redeeming the Church, that the Son of God do by his death purchase
   life for men, that he offereth himself in sacrifice to purge [553]
   men's sins, that he be punished with the hand of God, and that he go
   down even unto the very hell, that he may exalt us unto heaven, having
   delivered us from destruction. In sum, this place teacheth plainly how
   men are reconciled to God, how they obtain righteousness, how they come
   to the kingdom of God, being delivered from the tyranny of Satan, and
   loosed from the yoke of sin; to be brief, whence they must fetch all
   parts of their salvation.

   Notwithstanding, I will only expound those things which Luke here
   citeth, and there be, indeed, two members. In the former, he teacheth
   that Christ, to the end he may redeem the Church, [554] must needs be
   so broken, that he appear like to a man which is cast down and past
   hope. Secondly, he affirmeth that his death shall give life, and that
   there shall a singular triumph issue out of great despair. Whereas he
   compareth Christ to a lamb, which suffereth itself to be led and slain,
   and to a sheep, which offereth herself meekly to be shorn; his meaning
   is, that the sacrifice of Christ shall be voluntary. And surely this
   was the way to appease God's wrath, in that he showed himself obedient.
   He spake, indeed, before Pilate, (John 18:34, 36,) but not to save his
   life, but rather that he might willingly offer himself to die, [555] as
   he was appointed by the Father, and so might bring that punishment upon
   himself which was prepared for us. Therefore the prophet teacheth both
   things, that Christ must needs have suffered that he might purchase
   life for us, and that he was to suffer death willingly, that he might
   blot out the stubbornness of men by his obedience. And hence must we
   gather an exhortation unto godliness, [556] as Peter doth; but that
   doctrine of faith which I have already touched is former [557] in
   order.

   33. In his humility his judgment. The eunuch had either the Greek
   volume, or else Luke did set down the reading which was then used, as
   he useth to do. The prophet saith that Christ was exalted out of sorrow
   and judgment, by which words he signifieth a wonderful victory, which
   immediately ensued his casting down. For if he had been oppressed with
   death, there could nothing have been hoped for at his hands.

   Therefore, to the end the prophet may establish our faith in Christ,
   after that he had described him to be stricken with the hand of God,
   and to be subject to be slain, [558] he putteth upon him a new person
   now; to wit, that he cometh up out of the depth of death as a
   conqueror, and out of the very hell, being the author of eternal Life.
   I know, indeed, that this place is diversely expounded. Some there be
   which understand by this, that he was carried from the prison to the
   cross; other some there be who think that to be taken away doth signify
   as much as to be brought to nought. And, indeed, the signification of
   the Hebrew word, lchh (lachah) is doubtful, [559] as is also the
   signification of the Greek word airesthai. But he which shall
   thoroughly weigh the text, [context,] shall agree with me in that which
   I have said, that he passeth now from that doleful and unseemly sight
   which he had set before our eyes, unto the new beginning of
   unlooked-for glory. Therefore the Greek interpretation differeth not
   much from the words of the prophet in the sum of the matter. For
   Christ's judgment was exalted in his humility or casting down; because
   at such time as he might seem to be cast down and oppressed, the Father
   maintained his cause. After this sort judgment shall be taken in this
   place (as in many other) for right. But it signifieth condemnation in
   the Hebrew text. For the prophet saith, that after that Christ shall be
   brought into great straits, and shall be like unto a condemned and lost
   man, he shall be lifted up by the hand of the Father. Therefore the
   meaning of the words is, that Christ must first have suffered death,
   before the Father should exalt him unto the glory of his kingdom; which
   doctrine must be translated unto the whole body of the Church; because
   all the godly ought wonderfully to be lifted up with the hand of God,
   that they be not swallowed up of death. But when God appeareth to be
   the revenger of his, he doth not only restore them to life but also,
   getteth to them excellent triumphs of many deaths, as Christ did
   triumph most gloriously upon the cross; whereof the apostle maketh
   mention in the Colossians 2.

   His generation. After that the prophet hath set forth the victorious
   death of Christ, he addeth now that his victory shall not last only for
   a small time, but shall go beyond all number of years. For the
   exclamation of the prophet importeth as much as if he should deny that
   the perpetuity of Christ's kingdom can be expressed by the tongue of
   men. But interpreters have wrested this place miserably. Whereas the
   old writers have endeavored hereby to prove the Eternal Generation of
   the Word of God against Arius, it is too far dissenting from the
   prophet's mind. Chrysostom's exposition is never a whit truer, who
   referreth it unto the human generation. Neither do they understand the
   prophet's meaning, which suppose that he inveigheth against the men of
   that age. Other some think better, who take it to be spoken of the
   Church, save only that they are deceived in the word generation, which
   they think doth signify a posterity or issue. But the word dr, (dor,)
   which the prophet useth, signifieth, amongst the Hebrews, an age, or
   the continuance of man's life. Therefore, undoubtedly this is the
   prophet's meaning, that Christ's life shall endure for ever, when as he
   shall be once delivered by his Father's grace from death; although this
   life, which is without end, appertaineth unto the whole body of the
   Church; because Christ rose, not that he may live for hlmself, but for
   us. Therefore, he extolleth now in the members [560] the fruit and
   effect of that victory which he placed in the Head. Wherefore every one
   of the faithful may conceive sure hope of eternal life out of this
   place; secondly, the perpetuity of the Church is rather avouched in the
   person of Christ.

   Because his life is taken from the earth. This is, to look to, (to be)
   a very absurd reason, that Christ doth reign with such renown in heaven
   and earth, because he was cut off. For who can believe that death is
   the cause of life? But this was done by the wonderful counsel of God,
   that hell should be a ladder, whereby Christ should ascend into heaven;
   that reproach should be unto him a passage into life; that the joyful
   brightness of salvation should appear out of the horror and darkness of
   the cross; that blessed immortality should flow from the deep pit of
   death. Because he humbled himself, therefore the Father exalted him,
   that every knee may bow before him, (Philippians 2:10,) etc. Now must
   we bethink ourselves what fellowship we have with Christ, that it may
   not be troublesome to any to go the same way.

   34. The eunuch said to Philip. Here it appeareth what an earnest desire
   the eunuch had to learn. He wandereth in divers prophecies of Isaiah as
   through doubtful boughts, [561] and yet he is not weary of reading. And
   whilst that he arrogateth nothing to himself, he getteth far more,
   contrary to his hope, even at a sudden, than he could get during his
   whole life by taking great pains, if he had brought all his quickness
   of wit. So the Lord will be unto us a Master, though we be but small,
   if, acknowledging our ignorance, we be not loth to submit ourselves to
   learn. And as the seed, covered with earth, lieth hid for a time, so
   the Lord will illuminate us by his Spirit, and will cause that reading
   which, being barren and void of fruit, causeth nothing but
   wearisomeness, to have plain light of understanding. The Lord doth
   never keep the eyes of his so shut, but that so soon as they are once
   entered, the way of salvation appeareth unto them in the Scripture; but
   that they profit ever now and then a little by reading. Yet doth he
   suffer them to stick fast oftentimes, and permitteth their course to be
   hindered by some bar which is laid in the way, both that he may try
   patience of faith in them, and also that he may teach them humility, by
   putting them in mind of their ignorance, that he may make them more
   attentive after that they have shaken off drowsiness; that he may make
   them more fervent in prayer; that he may prick them forward to love the
   truth more dearly; that he may set forth the excellence of his heavenly
   wisdom, which is otherwise not so esteemed as it ought. But howsoever
   the faithful do not attain unto the mark of perfect knowledge, yet they
   shall always perceive that their labor is not in vain, so that they
   stop not the way before themselves with proud loathsomeness. [562] Let
   this going forward suffice us until the time of full revelation do
   come, that even a small taste of knowledge doth drip [563] into us the
   fear of God and faith.

   35. Philip, opening his mouth. To open the mouth is taken in Scripture
   for, to begin a long speech concerning some grave and weighty matter.
   Therefore Luke's meaning is, that Philip began to intreat [discourse]
   of Christ, as it were, with full mouth. He saith that he began with
   this prophecy, because there is no one which depainteth out Christ more
   lively; [564] and it was then brought [565] to his hand. Therefore,
   after that Philip had showed, by the prophet's words, after what sort
   Christ should come, and what was to be hoped for at his hands, he
   conferred the thing itself afterward, that the eunuch might know that
   that Christ which was promised was already revealed and given, and that
   he might understand his power. Where we translate it, that he preached
   Christ, Luke saith that he preached the gospel. The sense is, that he
   taught that of Christ which he uttered in his gospel himself, and
   commanded to be taught; whereby we gather, that when Christ is known,
   we have the sum of the gospel.

   Acts 8:36-40

   36. And as they went on the way, they came to a water. And the eunuch
   said, Lo, here is water, what letteth me to be baptized? 37. And Philip
   said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. He answering,
   said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 38. Then he
   commanded the chariot to be stayed, and they went both down into the
   water; to wit, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. 39. And when
   they were come out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away
   Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more. Therefore, he went on in his
   way rejoicing. 40. But Philip was found at Azotus; and, going on his
   journey, he preached the gospel to all cities, until he came to
   Cesarea.


   36. What letteth me? The eunuch's baptism ensueth now, whence we gather
   how greatly he profited in a small time, seeing he offereth himself
   willingly to give Christ his name. For it must needs be that faith was
   after a sort ripe in his heart, seeing that he brake out into external
   profession with such desire. I like not that which Chrysostom noteth,
   that he was kept back with modesty from requiring baptism plainly; for
   that interrogation hath greater vehemency than if he should simply have
   said to Philip, I will have thee to baptize me. But we see that Christ
   was preached to him in such sort, that he knew that baptism was a sign
   of new life in him, and that therefore he would not neglect the same,
   because it was added to the word, and such an addition as was
   inseparable. Therefore, as he embraced that willingly which he heard
   concerning Christ, so now he breaketh out with a godly zeal into the
   external confession of faith; neither doth he think it sufficient for
   him to believe inwardly before God, unless he testifieth before men
   that he is a Christian. There might many things have come into his
   mind, which might have kept him back from being baptized, lest that he
   should lay himself open to the hatred and rebukes both of the queen,
   and also of the whole nation. But he denieth that any of these things
   doth hinder him from desiring to be numbered amongst the disciples of
   Christ. If being instructed but a few hours he came to this point, how
   filthy is the sluggishness of those men who suppress the faith which
   they have conceived, having been taught five, ten, or twenty years?

   If thou believest with all thy heart. Whereas the eunuch is not
   admitted to baptism, until he have made confession of his faith, we
   must fetch a general rule hence, That those ought [not] to be received
   into the Church, who were estranged from the same before, until they
   have testified that they believe in Christ. For baptism is, as it were,
   an appurtenance of faith, and therefore it is later in order. Secondly,
   if it be given without faith whose seal it is, it is both a wicked and
   also too gross a profaning. But frantic fellows do both unskillfully
   and also wickedly impugn baptizing of infants under color hereof. Why
   was it meet that faith should go before baptism in the eunuch? To wit,
   because seeing that Christ marketh those alone which are of the
   household of the Church with this note and mark, they must be ingrafted
   unto the Church who are to be baptized. And as it is certain that those
   who are grown up are ingrafted by faith, so I say that the children of
   the godly are born the children of the Church, and that they are
   accounted members of Christ from the womb, because God adopteth us upon
   this condition, that he may be also the Father of our seed. Therefore,
   though faith be requisite in those which are grown up, yet this is
   untruly translated unto infants whose estate is far unlike. But certain
   great men have abused this place, when as they would prove that faith
   hath no confirmation by baptism. For they reasoned thus, The eunuch is
   commanded to bring perfect faith unto baptism, therefore there could
   nothing be added. But the Scripture taketh the whole heart oftentimes
   for a sincere and unfeigned heart, whose opposite is a double heart. So
   that there is no cause why we should imagine that they believe
   perfectly who believe with the whole heart, seeing that there may be a
   weak and faint faith in him who shall, notwithstanding, have a sound
   mind, and a mind free from all hypocrisy. Thus must we take that which
   David saith, That he loveth the Lord with all his heart. Philip had,
   indeed, baptized the Samaritans before, and yet he knew that they were
   yet far from the mark. Therefore, the faith of the whole heart is that
   which, having living roots in the heart, doth yet notwithstanding
   desire to increase daily.

   I believe that Jesus Christ. As baptism is grounded in Christ, and as
   the truth and force thereof is contained there, so the eunuch setteth
   Christ alone before his eyes. The eunuch knew before that there was one
   God, who had made the covenant with Abraham, who gave the law by the
   hand of Moses, which separated one people from the other nations, who
   promised Christ, through whom he would be merciful to the world. Now he
   confesseth that Jesus Christ is that Redeemer of the world, and the Son
   of God; under which title he comprehendeth briefly all those things
   which the Scripture attributeth to Christ. This is the perfect faith
   whereof Philip spake of late, which receiveth Christ, both as he was
   promised in times past, and also showed at length, and that with the
   earnest affection of the heart, as Paul will not have this faith to be
   feigned. Whosoever hath not this when he is grown up, in vain doth he
   boast of the baptism of his infancy. For to this end doth Christ admit
   infants by baptism, that so soon as the capacity of their age shall
   suffer, they may addict themselves to be his disciples, and that being
   baptized with the Holy Ghost, they may comprehend, with the
   understanding of faith, his power which baptism doth prefigure.

   38. They went down into the water. Here we see the rite used among the
   men of old time in baptism; for they put all the body into the water.
   Now the use is this, that the minister doth only sprinkle the body or
   the head. But we ought not to stand so much about such a small
   difference of a ceremony, that we should therefore divide the Church,
   or trouble the same with brawls. We ought rather to fight even an
   hundred times to death for the ceremony itself of baptism, inasmuch as
   it was delivered us by Christ that that we should suffer the same to be
   taken from us. But forasmuch as we have as well a testimony of our
   washing, as of newness of life, in the figure of water; forasmuch as
   Christ representeth unto us his blood in the water as in a glass, that
   we may fet [566] our cleanness thence; forasmuch as he teacheth that we
   are fashioned again by his Spirit, that being dead to sin, we may live
   to righteousness; it is certain that we want nothing which maketh to
   the substance of baptism. Wherefore the Church did grant liberty to
   herself, since the beginning, to change the rites somewhat, excepting
   this substance. For some dipped them thrice, some but once. Wherefore
   there is no case why we should be so straitlaced in matters which are
   of no such weight; [567] so that external pomp do no whit pollute the
   simple institution of Christ.

   39. When they were come up. To the end Luke may at length conclude his
   speech concerning the eunuch, he saith that Philip was caught away out
   of his sight. And that was of no small weight to confirm him, forasmuch
   as he saw that that man was sent unto him by God like to an angel, and
   that he vanished away before he could offer him any reward for all his
   pains; whence he might gather that it was no gainful insinuation,
   seeing that he was vanished away before he had one halfpenny given him.
   Whereas Philip had no reward at the eunuch's hand, let the servants of
   Christ learn hereby to serve him freely, or rather let them so serve
   men for nothing that they hope for a reward from heaven. The Lord
   granteth leave, indeed, to the ministers of the gospel to receive a
   reward at their hands whom they teach, (1 Corinthians 9:9,) but he
   forbiddeth them therewithal to be hirelings which labor for lucre's
   sake, (John 10:12, 13.) For this must be the mark whereat they must
   shoot, to gain the men themselves to God.

   Rejoicing. Faith and the knowledge of God bring forth this fruit always
   of themselves. For what truer matter of joy can be invented than when
   the Lord doth not only set open unto us the treasures of his mercy, but
   poureth out his heart into us, (that I may so speak,) and giveth us
   himself in his Son, that we may want nothing to perfect felicity? The
   heavens begin to look clear, and the earth beginneth to be quiet then;
   the conscience being then delivered from the doleful and horrible
   feelings of God's wrath, being loosed from the tyranny of Satan,
   escaping out of the darkness of death, beholdeth the light of life.
   Therefore it is a solemn thing amongst the prophets to exhort us to be
   joyful and to triumph, so often as they are about to speak of the
   kingdom of Christ. But because those men whose minds are possessed with
   the vain joys of the world, cannot lift up themselves unto this
   spiritual joy, let us learn to despise the world and all vain delights
   thereof, that Christ may make us merry indeed.

   40. He was found at Azotus. It is well known, out of the book of Joshua
   11:22, that Azotus was one of the cities out of which the sons of Anak
   could not be expelled. It is distant from Ascalon almost two hundred
   furlongs; the Hebrews call it Ashdod. Thither was Philip carried; there
   began he to take his journey on foot after the manner of men, sowing
   the seed of the gospel wheresoever he became, [passed.] This is surely
   rare and wonderful stoutness, [568] that he spreadeth the name of
   godliness in his journey. And whereas Luke saith expressly that he
   preached in all cities until he came to Cesarea, and doth not declare
   that he returned to Samaria, we may thereby conjecture that he staid at
   Cesarea for a time; and yet I leave this indifferent.

   CHAPTER 9
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 9:1-5

   1. And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
   disciples of the Lord, went unto the highest priest, 2. Required
   epistles of him to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he should find
   any of this sect, whether they were men or women, he might carry them
   bound to Jerusalem. 3. And as he was in the way, it happened that he
   drew near to Damascus: and suddenly there shined a light about him from
   heaven: 4. And falling flat to the ground, he heard a voice saying to
   him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 5. And he said, Who art thou,
   Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard
   for thee to kick against pricks.


   1. And Saul. Luke setteth down in this place a noble history, and a
   history full well worthy to be remembered, concerning the conversion of
   Paul; after what sort the Lord did not only bring him under, and make
   him subject to his commandment, when he raged like an untamed beast but
   also how he made him another and a new man. But because Luke setteth
   down all things in order as in a famous work of God, it shall be more
   convenient to follow his text, [context,] that all may come in order
   whatsoever is worth the noting. When as he saith, that he breathed out
   threatenings and slaughter as yet, his meaning is, that after that his
   hands were once imbued with innocent blood, he proceeded in like
   cruelty, and was always a furious and bloody enemy to the Church, after
   that he had once made that entrance [569] whereof mention is made in
   the death of Stephen. For which cause it was the more incredible that
   he could be so suddenly tamed. And whereas such a cruel wolf was not
   only turned into a sheep, but did also put on the nature of a shepherd,
   the wonderful hand of God did show itself therein manifestly.

   2. And Luke describeth therewithal that he was furnished with weapons
   and power to do hurt, when as he saith that he had obtained letters of
   the highest priest, that he might bring all those bound to Jerusalem
   whom he should find professing the name of Christ. There is mention
   made of women, that it may the better appear how desirous he was to
   shed blood who had no respect of sex whom even armed enemies are wont
   to spare in the heat of war. Therefore he setteth forth before us a
   fierce and cruel beast who had not only liberty given him to rage, but
   had also his power increased to devour and destroy godly men, as if a
   madman had a sword put into his hand. Whereas I have translated it
   sect, Luke hath way, which metaphor is common enough in the Scriptures.
   Therefore Paul's purpose was quite to put out the name of Christ by
   destroying all the godly cruelly.

   3. As he was in the way. In craving epistles of the high priest, he ran
   headlong against Christ willingly; and now he is enforced to obey
   whether he will or no. This is surely the most excellent mercy of God,
   in that that man is reclaimed unto salvation contrary to the purpose of
   his mind, whom so great a heat carried headlong into destruction.
   Whereas the Lord suffereth him to receive letters, and to come near to
   the city; (whereby we see how well he knoweth the very instants of
   times to do everything in due time; [570] ) he could have prevented him
   sooner, if it had seemed good to him so to do, that he might deliver
   the godly from fear and carelessness. [571] But he setteth out his
   benefits more thereby, in that he tieth the jaws of the greedy wolf,
   even when he was ready to enter the sheepfold. Also we know that men's
   stubbornness increaseth more and more by going forward. Wherefore the
   conversion of Paul was so much the harder, forasmuch as he was already
   made more obstinate by continuing his fury.

   Shined about him. Because it was no easy matter to pull down [572] so
   great pride to break such a lofty courage, to pacify such a blind heat
   of wicked zeal, and, finally, to bridle a most unbridled beast, Christ
   must needs have showed some sign of his majesty, whereby Paul might
   perceive that he had to do with God himself, and not with any mortal
   man;. although there were some respect had of humbling him, (because he
   was unworthy to have Christ,) to accustom him by and by to obey, by
   laying upon his neck the meek and sweet yoke of his Spirit. And he was
   scarce capable of so great gentleness, until his cruelty might be
   broken. [573] Man's sense cannot comprehend the Divine glory of Christ
   as it is; but as God did oftentimes put upon him forms wherein he did
   show himself, so Christ did now declare and make manifest his divinity
   to Paul, and showed some token of his presence, that he might thereby
   terrify Paul. For although the godly be afraid and tremble at the
   seeing of God, yet it must needs be that Paul was far more afraid when
   as he perceived that the divine power of Christ was set full against
   him.

   4. And therefore Luke saith that he fell to the ground. For what other
   thing can befall man, but that he must lie prostrate and be, as it
   were, brought to nothing, when he is overwhelmed with the present
   feeling of God's glory? And this was the first beginning of the
   bringing down of Paul, that he might become apt to hear the voice of
   Christ, which he had despised so long as he sat haughtily upon his
   horse.

   Saul, Saul! Luke compared the light which shined round about Paul to
   lightning, though I do not doubt but that lightnings did fly in the
   air. And this voice, which Christ did send out to beat down his pride,
   may full well be called a lightning or thunderbolt, because it did not
   only strike him, and make him astonished, but did quite kill him, so
   that he was now as nobody with himself, who did so much please himself
   before and did challenge to himself authority to put the gospel to
   flight. Luke putteth down his name in Hebrew in this place, Saul, Saul!
   because he repeateth the words of Christ, who spake unto him,
   undoubtedly, according to the common custom of the country.

   5. Who art thou, Lord? We have Paul now somewhat tamed, but he is not
   yet Christ's disciple. Pride is corrected in him, and his fury is
   brought down. But he is not yet so thoroughly healed that he obeyeth
   Christ; he is only ready to receive commandments, who was before a
   blasphemer. Therefore, this is the question of a man that is afraid,
   and thrown down with amazedness. For why doth he not know, by so many
   signs of God's presence, that it is God that speaketh? Therefore that
   voice proceeded from a panting and doubtful mind; therefore, Christ
   driveth him nigher unto repentance, When he addeth, I am Jesus, let us
   remember that that voice sounded from heaven. Therefore it ought to
   have pierced the mind of Paul when he considered that he had made war
   against God hitherto. It ought to have brought him by and by to true
   submission, when he considered that he should not escape scot free, if
   he should continue rebellious against him whose hand he could not
   escape.

   This place containeth a most profitable doctrine, and the profit
   thereof is made manifold, for Christ showeth what great account he
   maketh of his gospel, when he pronounceth that it is his cause, from
   which he will not be separated. Therefore he can no more refuse to
   defend the same than he can deny himself. Secondly, the godly may
   gather great comfort by this, in that they hear that the Son of God is
   partner with them of the cross, when as they suffer and labor for the
   testimony of the gospel, and that he doth, as it were, put under his
   shoulders, that he may bear some part of the burden. For it is not for
   nothing that he saith that he suffereth in our person; but he will have
   us to be assuredly persuaded of this, that he suffereth together with
   us, [574] as if the enemies of the gospel should wound us through his
   side. Wherefore Paul saith, that that is wanting in the sufferings of
   Christ what persecutions soever the faithful suffer at this day for the
   defense of the gospel, (Colossians 1:24.) Furthermore, this consolation
   tendeth not only to that end to comfort us, that it may not be
   troublesome to us to suffer with our Head, but that we may hope that he
   will revenge our miseries, who crieth out of heaven that all that which
   we suffer is common to him as well as to us. Lastly, we gather hereby
   what horrible judgment is prepared for the persecutors of the Church,
   who like giants besiege the very heaven, and shake their darts, which
   shall pierce [575] their own head by and by; yea, by troubling the
   heavens, they provoke the thunderbolt of God's wrath against
   themselves. Also, we are all taught generally, that no man run against
   Christ by hurting his brother unjustly, and specially, that no man
   resist the truth rashly and with a blind madness, under color of zeal.

   It is hard for thee. This is a proverbial sentence, taken from oxen or
   horses, which, when they are pricked with goads, do themselves no good
   by kicking, save only that they double the evil by causing the prick to
   go farther into their skins. Christ applieth this similitude unto
   himself very fitly, because men shall bring upon themselves a double
   evil, by striving against him, who must of necessity be subject to his
   will and pleasure, will they nill they. Those which submit themselves
   willingly to Christ are so far from feeling any pricking at his hands,
   that they have in him a ready remedy for all wounds; but all the
   wicked, who endeavor to cast out their poisoned stings against him,
   shall at length perceive that they are asses and oxen, subject to the
   prick. So that he is unto the godly a foundation whereon they rest, but
   unto the reprobate who stumble at him, a stone which with his [its]
   hardness grindeth them to powder. And although we speak here of the
   enemies of the gospel, yet this admonition may reach farther, to wit,
   that we do not think that we shall get any thing by biting the bridle
   so often as we have any thing to do with God, but that being like to
   gentle horses, we suffer ourselves meekly to be turned about and guided
   by his hand. And if he spur us at any time, let us be made more ready
   to obey by his pricks, lest that befall us which is said in the Psalm,
   That the jaws of untamed horses and mules are tied and kept in with a
   hard bit, lest they leap upon us, etc.

   In this history we have a universal figure of that grace which the Lord
   showeth forth daily in calling us all. All men do not set themselves so
   violently against the gospel; yet, nevertheless, both pride and also
   rebellion against God are naturally engendered in all men. We are all
   wicked and cruel naturally; therefore, in that we are turned to God,
   that cometh to pass by the wonderful and secret power of God, contrary
   to nature. The Papists also ascribe the praise of our turning unto God
   to the grace of God; yet only in part, because they imagine that we
   work together. But when as the Lord doth mortify our flesh, he subdueth
   us and bringeth us under, as he did Paul. Neither is our will one hair
   readier to obey than was Paul's, until such time as the pride of our
   heart be beaten down, and he have made us not only flexible but also
   willing to obey and follow. Therefore, such is the beginning of our
   conversion, that the Lord seeketh us of his own accord, when we wander
   and go astray, though he be not called and sought; that he changeth the
   stubborn affections of our heart, to the end he may have us to be apt
   to be taught.

   Furthermore, this history is of great importance to confirm Paul's
   doctrine. If Paul had always been one of Christ's disciples, wicked and
   froward men might extenuate the weight of the testimony which he giveth
   of his Master. If he should have showed himself to be easy to be
   entreated, and gentle at the first, we should see nothing but that
   which is proper to man. But when as a deadly enemy to Christ,
   rebellious against the gospel, puffed up with the confidence which he
   reposed in his wisdom, inflamed with hatred of the true faith, blinded
   with hypocrisy, wholly set upon the overthrowing of the truth, [he] is
   suddenly changed into a new man, after an unwonted manner, and of a
   wolf is not only turned into a sheep, but doth also take to himself a
   shepherd's nature, it is as if Christ should bring forth with his hand
   some angel sent from heaven. For we do not now see that Saul of Tarsus,
   but a new man framed by the Spirit of God; so that he speaketh by his
   mouth now, as it were from heaven.

   Acts 9:6-9

   6. And he trembling and fearing said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to
   do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, where it
   shall be told thee what thou must do. 7. And the men which accompanied
   him in his journey stood amazed, hearing indeed a voice, and seeing no
   man. 8. And when Saul was risen from the ground, when his eyes were
   opened he saw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him to
   Damascus. 9. And he was three days without sight, neither eating nor
   drinking.


   6. The fruit of that reprehension followeth, wherewith we have said it
   was requisite that Paul should have been sore shaken, that his hardness
   might be broken. For now he offereth himself as ready to do whatsoever
   he should command him, whom of late he despised. For when he asketh
   what Christ would have him do, he granteth him authority and power.
   Even the very reprobate are also terrified with the threatening of God,
   so that they are compelled to reverence him, and to submit themselves
   unto his will and pleasure; yet, nevertheless, they cease not to fret
   and to foster stubbornness within. But as God humbled Paul, so he
   wrought effectually in his heart. For it came not to pass by any
   goodness of nature, that Paul did more willingly submit himself to God
   than Pharaoh, (Exodus 7:13;) but because, being like to an anvil,
   [Pharaoh] did, with his hardness, beat back the whips of God wherewith
   he was to be brought under, (even as it had been the strokes of a
   hammer;) but the heart of Paul was suddenly made a fleshy heart of a
   stony heart, after that it received softness from the Spirit of God;
   which softness it had not naturally. The same thing do we also try
   [experience] daily in ourselves. He reproveth us by his word; he
   threateneth and terrifieth us; he addeth also light correction, and
   prepareth us divers ways unto subjection. But all these helps shall
   never cause any man to bring forth good fruit, unless the Spirit of God
   do mollify his heart within.

   And the Lord said unto him. After that Paul had put his stiff neck
   under the yoke of Christ, he is now governed by his hand. For doubtless
   the Lord doth not so bring us into the way, that he leaveth us either
   before we begin our course, or in the midst thereof; but he bringeth us
   unto the very mark by little and little. Luke depainteth out unto us in
   this place this continual course of God's governance. For He taketh him
   afterward unto himself to be taught whom He hath made apt to be taught.
   Neither doth that any whit hinder that he useth man's ministry ill this
   point. Because the authority and power remaineth nevertheless in him,
   howsoever he accomplish his work by man; though it may seem an absurd
   thing that Christ, who is the Eternal Wisdom of God, doth send a
   scholar (who was ready to hear, and did gape after instruction) unto
   another [576] man, that he might learn. But I answer, that that was
   done not without cause. For the Lord meant by this means to prove
   Paul's modesty, when he sendeth him to one of his scholars to be
   taught; as if he himself would not vouchsafe as yet to speak unto him
   familiarly, but sendeth him to his servants whom he did of late both so
   proudly contemn and so cruelly persecute.

   And we are also taught humility under his person. For if Christ made
   Paul subject to the teaching of a common disciple, which of us can
   grudge to hear any teacher, so that he be appointed by Christ, that is,
   he declare himself to be his minister in deed? Therefore, whereas Paul
   is sent to Ananias, let us know that that is done to adorn the ministry
   of the Church. This is assuredly no small honor whereunto it pleaseth
   God to exalt mankind, when as he chooseth our brethren from amongst us
   to be interpreters of his will; when as he causeth his holy oracles to
   sound in the mouth of man, which is naturally given to lying and
   vanity. But the unthankfulness of the world betrayeth itself again
   herein, that no man can abide to hear when God speaketh by the mouth of
   man. All men could desire to have angels come flying unto them, or that
   heaven should be now and then cut asunder, and that the visible glory
   of God should come thence. Forasmuch as this preposterous curiosity
   springeth from pride and wicked contempt of the Word, it setteth open a
   gate to many dotings, and breaketh the bond of mutual consent among the
   faithful. Therefore the Lord doth testify, that it pleaseth him that we
   should be taught by men, and confirmeth the order set down by himself.
   And to this purpose serve these titles, "He which heareth you heareth
   me," (Luke 10:16;) that he may cause his word to be reverenced as it
   ought.

   It shall be told thee. Christ putteth Ananias in his place by these
   words, as touching the office of teaching; not because he resigneth his
   authority to him, but because he shall be a faithful minister, and a
   sincere preacher of the gospel. Therefore we must always use this
   moderation, that we hear God alone in Christ, and Christ himself alone,
   yet as he speaketh by his ministers. And these two vices must be
   avoided, that the ministers be not proud, under color of such a
   precious function, or that their base condition impair no whit of the
   dignity of heavenly wisdom.

   7. And the men. He speaketh now briefly of the companions of Paul, that
   they were witnesses of the vision. Yet it seemeth that this narration
   doth not in all points agree with that of Paul, which we shall see in
   the 22nd chapter, (Acts 22:9.) For he will say there, that his
   companions were terrified with the light, but they heard no voice. Some
   there be who think that it was a fault, [577] and that through
   ignorance of the writer [578] the negation is placed out of its right
   place. I think that it is no hard matter to answer it; because it may
   be that they heard the sound of the voice, yet did they not discern
   either who it was that spake, or what was spoken. "They heard not,"
   saith he, "the voice of him that spake with me." Surely this is the
   meaning of these words, that he alone knew the speech of Christ. It
   followeth not thereupon, but that the rest might have heard a dark and
   doubtful voice. Whereas Luke saith in this place that there was a voice
   heard, and no man seen, his meaning is, that the voice proceeded from
   no man, but that it was uttered by God. Therefore, to the end the
   miracle may carry the greater credit, Paul's companions see a light
   like to lightning; they see Paul lie prostrate; a voice they hear
   (though not distinctly [579] ) sounding from heaven; and yet,
   nevertheless, Paul alone is taught what he must do.

   8. He was raised up from the earth. Luke addeth now, that he was taken
   with so great fear that he could not rise of himself; and not that
   only, but he was also blind for a time, that he might forget his former
   wit and wiliness. [580] When as he saith, that after that his eyes were
   opened, he saw not, it seemeth that it doth not agree with the other
   words which shall follow by and by, that his eyes were covered, as it
   were, with scales; but the meaning of this place is, that he was blind
   indeed, and deprived of his sight for that three days; because when he
   opened his eyes he saw nothing.

   9. Whereas he saith, that he neither ate nor drank for the space of
   three days, that is to be counted a part of the miracle. For although
   the men of the east country endure hunger better than we, yet we do not
   read that any did fast three days, save only those who had want of
   victual, or who were constrained by some greater necessity. Therefore
   we gather that Paul was wonderfully afraid, [581] seeing that being, as
   it were, dead, he tasted no meat for three days.

   Acts 9:10-12

   10. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, called Ananias, unto
   whom the Lord said in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Here am I, Lord.
   11. And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the way that is
   called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas one called Saul of
   Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth. 12. And he hath seen in a vision a
   man, named Ananias, entering in, and laying his hand upon him that he
   might see.


   10. We have said before that this man was rather chosen than any of the
   apostles, that Paul, having laid away the swelling of his arrogancy,
   might learn to hear the least, and that he [might] come down from too
   great loftiness even unto the lowest degree. And this vision was
   necessary for Ananias, lest through fear he should withdraw himself
   from that function which was enjoined him, to wit, to teach Paul. For
   though he know that the Lord calleth him, yet he slideth back, or, at
   least, he excuseth himself. Therefore it was requisite that he should
   have some certain testimony of his calling, that there should happy
   success be promised to his labor, that he might take that in hand with
   a joyful and valiant mind which the Lord commanded. Furthermore, as
   Christ animateth and confirmeth Ananias, by appearing to him in the
   vision, so he prepareth and maketh Paul ready for all things, that he
   may receive Ananias reverently, as if he would receive an angel coming
   from heaven. The Lord could have sent Paul straightway unto Ananias,
   and have showed him his house, but this was more fit for his
   confirmation; because he knew the better that the Lord had a care of
   him. And also the Lord setteth out his grace unto us, that as he
   stopped Paul before, so now he reacheth him his hand of his own accord,
   by his minister. And, in the mean season, we are also taught, by his
   example, to be more ready and careful to seek out the lost sheep.

   In a vision. This word vision signifieth some light [582] which was set
   before the eyes to testify God's presence. For this is the use of
   visions, that the majesty of the Word being well proved, it may
   purchase credit, amongst men; which kind of confirmation God used
   oftentimes toward the prophets; as he saith, that he speaketh to his
   servants by a vision or by a dream. He hath, indeed, suffered Satan to
   deceive the unbelievers with false imaginations and visures. [583] But
   forasmuch as Satan's juggling casts are of power only in darkness, God
   doth lighten the minds of his children so, that they assure themselves
   that they need not to fear legerdemain. [584] Therefore Ananias
   answereth, Here am I, Lord, knowing indeed that it was God.

   11. For, behold, he prayeth. Luke showeth that Paul gave himself [585]
   to prayer those three days; and peradventure this was one cause why he
   fasted, although it be certain, as I have already said, that he
   suffered such long hunger, because he was after a sort deprived of
   sense, as men which are in a trance use to be. Christ doth assuredly
   speak of no short prayer [586] in this place, but he doth rather show
   that Paul continued in this kind of exercise until he should be more
   quiet in mind. For besides other causes of terror, that voice might
   sound in his ears, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" And it is not
   to be doubted but that the careful [587] looking for a perfect
   revelation did marvellously trouble his mind; but this was the reason
   why the Lord caused him to wait three days, that he might the more
   kindle in him an earnest desire to pray.

   12. He saw a man, named Ananias. It is uncertain whether Luke do yet
   repeat the words of Christ, or he add this of his own. Those which take
   it in the person of Luke are moved with some show of absurdity, because
   it is an unlikely thing that Christ used these words. Although this may
   be easily answered thus, to wit, that Christ confirmeth Ananias after
   this sort, There is no cause why thou shouldst fear but that he will
   receive thee willingly, forasmuch as he already knoweth thy shape by a
   vision. I have also told him thy name, and whatsoever thou shalt do
   with him. Yet may the reader choose whether he will.

   Acts 9:13-16

   13. And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard of many of this man, what
   hurt he hath done to thy servants at Jerusalem: 14. And here he hath
   power from the priests to bind all which call upon thy name. 15. And
   the Lord said unto him, Go; because he is a chosen instrument to me to
   bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of
   Israel. 16. For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my
   name.


   13. Lord, I have heard. In that Ananias objecteth the danger to the
   Lord, he betrayeth his weakness of faith therein. Therefore we see that
   the saints and servants of God are afraid of death, which thing keepeth
   them back from doing their duty; yea, it causeth them sometimes to
   stagger. Ananias would gladly go to some other place; but this is a
   point of a good man, that he yieldeth not so much to fear that he
   withdraweth himself from Christ's obedience. And, therefore, this is a
   sign of rare obedience, [588] that although through fear of death he
   were somewhat slack at the first, yet having forgotten himself by and
   by, he maketh great haste to go whither Christ called him. And yet,
   notwithstanding, he refuseth not flatly in these words to do that which
   he is commanded to do, but useth an excuse [589] very modestly, Lord,
   what meaneth this, that thou sendest me to the hangman? Therefore we
   may see a desire to obey mixed with fear.

   14. He hath power to bind. We gather by these words, that the fame of
   the persecution which Saul went about [590] was spread far and wide;
   for which cause his conversion was [591] more famous. Nevertheless, the
   Lord suffered the faithful to be evil entreated, [592] that the benefit
   of such sudden deliverance might afterwards be the more excellent. We
   must mark that speech, when he saith that the godly call upon the name
   of Christ. For whether you understand it, that inasmuch as they
   professed that they were Christ's, they rejoiced therefore in him, or
   that they used to fly to him for succor, invocation cannot be without
   sure confidence. By both which the divinity of Christ is not only
   proved, but also if the second be received, which seemeth to be more
   natural, [593] we are taught by the example of the faithful, to call
   upon the name of Christ when he is preached to us.

   15. Go; because he is an elect instrument. The commandment repeated the
   second time, and also the promise of success added, taketh away all
   doubtfulness. Therefore sloth shall want an excuse, if it be never
   redressed after that many pricks be used; like as we see that very
   many, who howsoever the Lord cry unto them continually, do not only
   loiter during their whole life, but do also cherish their slothfulness
   by all means possible. [594] If any man object that the Lord speaketh
   not at this day in a vision, I answer, that forasmuch as the Scripture
   is abundantly confirmed to us, we must hear God thence. [595]

   A vessel of election, or, as Erasmus translateth it, an elect
   instrument, is taken for an excellent minister. The word instrument
   doth show that men can do nothing, save inasmuch as God useth their
   industry at his pleasure. For if we be instruments, he alone is the
   author; the force and power to do is in his power alone. And that which
   Christ speaketh in this place of Paul appertaineth to all men, both one
   and other. Therefore how stoutly soever every man labor, and how
   carefully soever he behave himself in his duty, yet there is no cause
   why he should challenge to himself any part of praise. Those which
   dispute subtilely about the word vessel, dote through ignorance of the
   Hebrew tongue. Luke putteth the genitive ease for the dative and that
   according to the common custom of the Hebrew tongue. And he meant to
   express a certain excellency, as if he should have said, that this man
   shall be no common minister of Christ, but shall be indued with
   singular excellency above others. Nevertheless, we must note that if
   any thing be excellent, it dependeth upon the favor of God, as Paul
   himself teacheth elsewhere. Who is he that separateth thee? to wit,
   that thou shouldst excel others, (1 Corinthians 4:7.) To conclude,
   Christ pronounceth that Paul was chosen unto great and excellent
   things.

   To bear my name amongst the Gentiles. To him who went about before to
   suppress the name of Christ is the same now committed to be borne. If
   we please to take snm (schenos) for a vessel, this should be a
   continual metaphor, because a minister of the gospel serveth instead of
   a vessel to publish the name of Christ; but because it signifieth
   rather amongst the Hebrews any instrument generally, I take these words
   to carry my name, for to extol the same unto due honor. For Christ is
   placed after a sort in his princely throne when as the world is brought
   under his power by the preaching of the gospel.

   16. And because. Paul could not do this, and have Satan quiet, and the
   world to yield to him willingly; therefore Luke addeth, that he shall
   be also taught to bear the cross. For the meaning of the words is, I
   will accustom him to suffer troubles: to endure reproaches, and to
   abide all manner [of] conflicts, that nothing may terrify him, and keep
   him back from doing his duty. And when Christ maketh himself Paul's
   teacher in this matter, he teacheth that the more every man hath
   profited in his school, the more able is he to bear the cross. For we
   strive against it, and refuse it as a thing most contrary, until he
   make our minds more gentle. Also this place teacheth, that no man is
   fit to preach the gospel, seeing the world is set against it, save only
   he which is armed to suffer. Therefore if we will show ourselves
   faithful ministers of Christ, we must not only crave at his hands the
   spirit of knowledge and wisdom, but also of constancy and strength,
   that we may never be discouraged by laboring and toiling; which is the
   estate of the godly.

   Acts 9:17-19

   17. And Ananias went and entered into the house, and when he had laid
   his hands upon him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord hath sent me,
   namely Jesus, who appeared to thee in the way as thou camest, that thou
   mayest recover thy sight, and that thou mayest be filled with the Holy
   Ghost. 18. And forthwith there fell from his eyes as it had been
   scales: and he recovered his sight by and by; and arising he was
   baptized. 19. And when he had taken meat he was strengthened.


   17. Having laid his hands upon. We have said elsewhere that this was a
   solemn, and, as it were, an ordinary thing amongst the Jews, to lay
   their hands upon those whom they did commend to God. The apostles
   translated that custom taken from sacrifices to their use, either when
   they gave the visible graces of the Spirit or when they made any man
   minister of the Church. To this end doth Ananias lay his hands now upon
   Paul, partly that he may consecrate him unto God, partly that he may
   obtain for him the gifts of the Spirit. And though there be no mention
   made of doctrine in this place yet it shall appear afterwards by Paul's
   narration, that Ananias was also commanded to teach him; and by
   baptism, which was later in order, we gather that he was instructed in
   the faith. Let the readers note out of the chapter next going before
   how this ceremony is effectual to give the Spirit, But seeing Paul
   received the Spirit by the hand of Ananias, the Papists are more than
   ridiculous, who will have the bishops alone to lay on their hands.

   18. There fell from his eyes as it had been scales. The blindness of
   Paul, as we have said before did not proceed from fear alone or from
   amazedness; but by this means was he admonished of his former
   blindness, that he might quite abandon that boldness and vain
   confidence wherewith he was puffed up. He boasted that he was taught at
   the feet of Gamaliel, (Acts 22:3;) and undoubtedly he thought very well
   of his great wittiness, [596] which was notwithstanding mere blindness.
   Therefore he is deprived of the sight of his body [597] three days,
   that he may begin to see with his mind; for those must become fools,
   whosoever they be, which seem to themselves wise, that they may attain
   to true wisdom. For seeing that Christ is the Sun of righteousness, in
   seeing without him we see not; it is he also which openeth the eyes of
   the mind. Both things were showed to Paul, and to us are they showed in
   his person; for he hath his eyes covered with scales, that, condemning
   all his knowledge of ignorance, [598] he may learn that he hath need of
   new light, which he hath hitherto wanted; and he is taught that he must
   let [seek] the true light from none other save only from Christ, and
   that it is given by no other means save only through his goodness.
   Furthermore, whereas being pined with three days hunger, he maketh no
   haste to receive meat until he be baptized, thereby appeareth the
   earnest [599] desire he had to learn, because he refreshed not his body
   with meat until his soul had received strength.

   Acts 9:19-25

   And Saul was with the disciples which were at Damascus certain days.
   20. And by and by he preached Christ, that he was the Son of God. 21.
   And they were all amazed which heard, and said, Is not this he which at
   Jerusalem made havock of those who called upon his name, and he [had
   come] came hither to that end, that he might carry them bound unto the
   priests? 22. And Saul waxed more strong, and confounded the Jews which
   dwelt at Damascus, proving that this was Christ. 23. And when many days
   were past, the Jews took counsel together to put him to death: 24. And
   their laying in wait was known to Saul. And they kept the gates day and
   night, that they might slay him: 25. And the disciples having taken him
   by night, put him down through [by] a wall, and let him down in a
   basket.


   20. Luke declareth now how fruitful Paul's conversion was, to wit, that
   he came abroad by and by, [600] and did not only profess that he was a
   disciple of Christ, but did also set himself against [601] the fury and
   hatred of the enemies, by defending the gospel stoutly. Therefore, he
   who of late ran headlong against Christ with furious force, doth now
   not only submit himself meekly unto his will and pleasure but like a
   stout standard-bearer fighteth even unto the utmost danger to maintain
   his glory. Certain it is that he was not so quickly framed by Ananias'
   industry, [602] but that so soon as he had learned the first principles
   by man's mouth, he was extolled by God unto higher things afterward. He
   comprehendeth the sum of his preaching briefly, when he saith that
   Christ was the Son of God. In the same sense, he saith shortly after
   that he saw Christ. And understand thus much, that when Paul intreated
   out of the law and the prophets of the true office of the Messiah, he
   taught also that all whatsoever was promised of, and was to be hoped
   for, at the hands of the Messiah, was revealed and given in Christ. For
   the words signify thus much, when he saith that he preached that Christ
   is the Son of God. That was undoubtedly a principle amongst the Jews,
   that there should a Redeemer come from God, who should restore all
   things to a happy estate. Paul teacheth that Jesus of Nazareth is he,
   which he cannot do, unless he shake off those gross errors which he had
   conceived of the earthly kingdom of the Messiah. Certain it is that
   Paul declared how Christ was promised in the law, and to what end; but
   because all tended to this end, that he might prove that the son of
   Mary was he of whom the law and the prophets bare witness, therefore
   Luke is content with this one word only.

   21. They were all amazed. This is added, that we may know that the
   power of God was acknowledged. For seeing that the zeal of Paul against
   the gospel was openly known, they saw no other cause of such a sudden
   change but the hand of God. And, therefore, this is also one fruit of
   the miracle, that they all wonder at him being made a new man so
   suddenly, so that his doctrine doth the more move their minds. Whereas
   they say that he raged horribly with great cruelty, and that he came of
   late to Damascus that he might proceed in his purpose, these
   circumstances serve to augment the miracle. We must also note the
   phrase, those which call on his name, which withesseth that the godly
   did so profess the name of Christ, that they placed all their hope of
   salvation in him. According to that, these

   "men put their trust in chariots, and others in horses, but we will
   call upon the name of the Lord,"
   (Psalm 20:7.)

   Finally, whatsoever the Scripture commandeth concerning calling upon
   the name of God, it agreeth to the person of Christ.

   22. And Saul waxed stronger. Luke doth not only in this place commend
   the bold zeal of Paul in confessing the faith of Christ, but also he
   telleth us that he had strong reasons to convince the Jews. He waxed
   strong, saith he, that is, he got the victory in disputation; his
   confession did carry with it great force and efficacy, [603] because
   being furnished with testimonies of Scripture, and such other helps of
   the Holy Ghost, he did, as it were, tread all his adversaries under his
   feet. [604] For the word confounded, which Luke useth, doth signify,
   that, forasmuch as Paul did urge them out of measure, they were so
   stricken that they could not tell where they were. [605] The manner of
   the confounding is expressed, because Paul proved that Jesus was
   Christ. For the sense is this, that even when the Jews were most
   desirous to resist, they were overcome and confounded. So that Paul
   tried [found] by experience, that that was most true which he himself
   affirmeth, that the Scripture is profitable to convince, (2 Timothy
   3:16.) Also, he performed that which he required elsewhere of a bishop
   and teacher, (Titus 1:7;) for he was armed with the word of God to
   maintain the truth. And Luke setteth down two things, that Paul so got
   the victory in disputing that he overthrew the Jews; and yet their
   stubbornness was not broken and tamed that they yielded to the truth,
   because their consciences rage nevertheless inwardly, and being thrown
   down from their false opinion, they do not submit themselves to Christ.

   Whence had Paul this victory, save only because the Scripture was his
   sword? Therefore, so often as heretics stand up to resist the true
   faith, so often as wicked men endeavor to overthrow all godliness, so
   often as the ungodly do obstinately resist, let us remember that we
   must fet [seek] armor hence. Because the Papists find no weapons in
   Scripture, yea, because they see that it maketh quite against them,
   they fly into this miserable fortress [606] that they must not dispute
   with heretics, and that there can no certain thing be set down out of
   Scripture. But if Satan himself be vanquished with the sword of the
   word, why shall it not be able to put heretics to flight? not that they
   will submit themselves, or make an end of murmuring, [607] but because
   they shall lie overcome in themselves. [608] And if so be it we covet
   to escape this trouble, let us raise no tumults against God, but let
   us, with a quiet and meek spirit, receive that peace which the
   Scripture offereth us.

   23. When many days were fulfilled. He saith that many days were
   expired, that we may know that Paul had some space of time granted him
   wherein he might do good. For although the Jews did resist him even
   from the first day, yet the Lord did not suffer the course which he had
   begun well to be broken off so soon, so he doth with his wonderful
   counsel hinder the purposes of the enemies, stay their endeavors,
   restrain their malice and madness, whilst that he furthereth [609] the
   gospel; and also we see what the hatred of the truth doth. For when the
   wicked see that they are unable to resist, they are carried headlong
   into bloody fury. They would gladly contemn the word of God if they
   could; but because they are enforced, whether they will or no, to feel
   the force thereof, they run headlong, like furious beasts, with blind
   violence. [610] The unadvised and rash heat of zeal will always almost
   break out into such cruelty, unless men suffer themselves to be ruled
   by the word of God. This is, assuredly, horrible blindness. For why are
   they so mad, save only because their wounded conscience doth vex them?
   But God doth by this means punish their hypocrisy, who do, therefore,
   hate sound religion; because, being friends of darkness, they fly the
   light.

   Furthermore, we see how sweetly these preposterous zealous fellows
   [611] grant themselves liberty to do whatsoever them lusteth, when
   Satan hath once pricked them forward to persecute the truth. For they
   fear not to take counsel, under color of zeal, to put a man to death,
   which they know is mere wickedness, [612] as at this day the Papists
   think that they may do whatsoever they will, so they can quench the
   doctrine of the gospel. They rage not only with sword, but they go
   about by lying in wait, by treachery, and by most execrable means, to
   destroy us. We must, first, beware that that do not befall us, that we
   entangle not ourselves in the defense of evil causes; secondly, that we
   handle those causes well which we know are good. But it is to be
   thought that they laid wait for Paul privily; that done, when they
   could do no good this way, it is likely that they came to the governor
   of the city, and that then the gates were watched, that they might by
   one means or other catch him. For Paul saith that Aretas, the king's
   governor, commanded that which Luke attributeth in this place to the
   Jews.

   25. The disciples having taken him by night. There is a question moved
   here, whether it were lawful for the disciples to save Paul thus or no?
   and also, whether it were lawful for Paul to escape danger by this
   means or no? For the laws say that the walls of cities are holy,
   [sacred,] and that the gates are holy. Therefore, he ought rather to
   have suffered death, than to have suffered a public order to be broken
   for his sake. I answer, that we must consider why it is decreed by the
   laws that the walls should not be violated; to wit, that the cities may
   not be laid open to murders and robberies, and that the cities may be
   free [613] from treason. That reason ceaseth when the question is
   concerning the delivery of an innocent man. Therefore, it was no less
   lawful for the faithful to be let down in a basket, than it shall be
   lawful for any private person to leap over a wall, that he may avoid
   [614] the sudden invasion of the enemy. Cicero doth handle this latter
   member, and he setteth down very well, that although the law forbid a
   stranger to come near the wall, yet doth not he offend who shall go up
   upon the wall to save the city, because the laws must always be
   inclined [615] to equity. Therefore Paul is not to be blamed, because
   he escaped by stealth, seeing that he doth that without raising any
   tumult amongst the people. Nevertheless, we see how the Lord useth to
   humble those that be his, seeing that Paul is enforced to steal his
   life from the watchmen of the city if he will save himself. Therefore,
   he reckoneth this example amongst his infirmities. He was acquainted
   betime with the cross [616] with this first exercise.

   Acts 9:26-31

   26. And when Saul was at Jerusalem, he essayed to join himself to the
   disciples, and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a
   disciple. 27. But when Barnabas had taken him, he brought him to the
   apostles, and he told them how that he had seen the Lord in the way,
   and that he had spoken to him, and how he had behaved himself boldly at
   Damascus, in the name of Jesus, 28. And he was conversant with them at
   Jerusalem; and when he was emboldened in the name of the Lord Jesus,
   29. He spake, and disputed with the Grecians. And they went about to
   kill him. 30. Which when the brethren knew, they brought him to
   Cesarea, and sent him to Tarsus. 31. Then the churches throughout all
   Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had peace; and they were edified, and
   walked in the fear of the Lord, and were filled with the consolation of
   the Holy Spirit.


   26. When Saul was. These were yet hard entrances [617] for Paul, who
   was as yet but a freshwater soldier, in that, when he had hardly
   escaped the hands of the enemies, the disciples would not receive him.
   For he might have seemed to have been so tossed to and fro, as it were,
   in mockery, that he could have no resting place. All his own nation was
   set against him for Christ's cause. The Christians refuse him. Might he
   not have been quite discouraged and out of hope as one expelled out of
   men's company? First, what remaineth but that he fall away from the
   Church, seeing he is not received? But when he remembereth the life
   which he had led aforetime he marvelleth not that they are afraid [618]
   of him. Therefore, he doth patiently suffer the brethren to refuse his
   company, seeing they had just cause of fear. This was true conversion,
   that whereas he raged horribly before, he doth now valiantly suffer the
   storms of persecutions; and, in the mean season, when as he cannot be
   admitted into the company of the godly, he waiteth with a quiet mind
   until God reconcile them unto him. We must diligently note what he
   desireth, to wit, that he may be numbered amongst the disciples of
   Christ. This can he not obtain. Here is no ambition, but he was to be
   instructed by this means to make more account even of the lowest place
   amongst the disciples of Christ than of all masterships in corrupt and
   revolted [619] synagogues, And from this submission was he exalted unto
   the highest degree of honor, that he might be the principal doctor of
   the Church, even unto the end of the world. But no man is fit to be a
   teacher in the Church save only he who willingly submitteth himself,
   [620] that he may be a fellow disciple with other men.

   27. When Barnabas had taken him. Whereas the disciples fled so fast
   from Paul, that was, peradventure, a point of too great fearfulness,
   [621] and yet he speaketh of none of the common sort, but of the
   apostles themselves. But he doth either extenuate or lighten their
   fault, because they suspected him for just causes, whom they had found
   and tried [622] to be such a deadly enemy; and, it was to be feared,
   lest they should rashly endanger themselves if they should have showed
   themselves to be so easy to entreat. Therefore, I think that they are
   not to be blamed for that fear which they conceived for just cause, or
   that they deserve to be even accused for the same. For if they had been
   called to give an account of their faith, they would have provoked
   [623] not Paul only, but also all the furies of hell, without fear.
   Whence we gather that every fear is not to be condemned but such as
   causeth us to turn aside from our duty. The narration which Luke addeth
   may be referred as well unto the person of Barnabas as of Paul. Yet I
   think rather that Paul declareth to the apostles what had befallen him;
   and yet the speech may be well applied to Barnabas, especially when as
   mention is made of Paul's boldness.

   28. Luke saith afterwards that Paul went in and out with the disciples,
   which speech signifieth amongst the Hebrews familiarity, as the
   inhabitants of cities are said to go in and out at the gates of the
   city. Therefore after that Paul was commended by the testimony of
   Barnabas, he began to be counted one of the flock, that he might be
   thoroughly known to the Church. Luke saith again that he dealt boldly
   in the name of the Lord, by which words he commendeth his (stoutness
   and) courage in professing the gospel. For he durst never have
   whispered amidst so many lets, unless he had been endowed with rare
   constancy. Nevertheless, all men are taught what they ought to do; to
   wit, every man according to the measure of his faith. For though all be
   not Pauls, yet the faith of Christ ought to engender in our minds so
   great boldness, that we be not altogether dumb when we have need to
   speak. I take the name of the Lord in this place for the profession of
   the gospel; in this sense, that Paul defended Christ's cause manfully.

   29. He disputed with the Grecians. Erasmus noteth well in this place
   that those are here called Grecians, not which came [624] of Grecians,
   but rather those Jews who were scattered throughout divers parts of the
   world. Those men were wont to come together [625] to Jerusalem to
   worship. And it is to be thought that Paul disputed rather with
   strangers and aliens, [626] than with those who dwelt at Jerusalem,
   [627] because this latter sort would never have abidden him, neither
   had it been wisely done to come in their sight. Therefore being
   excluded from those who knew him before he tried whether there were any
   hope to do good amongst men whom he knew not, so that he did most
   stoutly whatsoever concerned the duty of a valiant soldier.

   They would have slain him. Behold, again, fury instead of zeal; and it
   cannot otherwise be, but that hypocrisy and superstition will be cruel
   and fierce. The godly must be incensed with an holy wrath, when they
   see the pure truth of God corrupted with false and wicked opinions;
   yet, so that they moderate their zeal, that they set down nothing until
   they have thoroughly weighed the cause; and, secondly, that they essay
   to bring those into the way who wander out of the same. Lastly, that if
   they see their stubbornness to be past hope, they themselves take not
   the sword in hand, because they must know that they have no authority
   granted them of the Lord to (punish or) revenge. But hypocrites are
   always ready to shed blood before they know the matter; so that
   superstition is bloody, through blind and headlong fury. But Paul, who
   of late ran up and down to vex the godly, can abide nowhere now. [628]
   And yet this estate was far better for him, than if he should have
   reigned in peace and quietness, driving the godly everywhere out of
   their places.

   30. In that he went to Tarsus, he did it undoubtedly to this end, that
   he might carry the doctrine of the gospel thither, because he hoped
   that he should have some favor and authority in his country, where he
   was famous; yet was he brought thither by the brethren, that they might
   deliver him from the lying in wait.

   31. Then the Churches. Luke's meaning is, that the enemies of the
   gospel were greatly provoked by Paul's presence. For why was there such
   peace made suddenly by his departure, save only because the very sight
   of him did provoke the fury of the enemies? And yet this is no reproach
   to him, as if he had been, as it were, some trumpet in war; but Luke
   doth rather commend him for this, because he made the wicked run mad,
   only with the smell of him when he was near them. For Christ meant so
   to triumph in him, that he might be no less a trouble than an ornament
   to his Church.

   Therefore we are taught by this example that those are not by and by
   [629] to be condemned, who inflame the madness of the wicked more than
   others; which admonition is not a little profitable. For as we are too
   dainty and too much besotted with the love of our own rest, so we be
   also sometimes angry with the best and most excellent servants of
   Christ, if we think that through their vehemency the wicked are pricked
   forward to do hurt; and by this means we do injury to the Spirit of
   God, whose force and speech kindleth all that flame.

   And whereas Luke saith, that the Churches had peace, let us know that
   it was not continual, but because the Lord granted his servants some
   short breathing. For thus doth he bear with [630] our infirmity, when
   he appeaseth or mitigateth the winds and storms of persecutions, lest
   if they should hold on still, they should urge us out of measure. And
   this blessing is not to be despised, neither is it any common blessing,
   when as the Churches have peace. But Luke addeth other things, which
   are of far more value; to wit, that the Churches were edified, they
   walked in the fear of God, and they were filled with the consolation of
   the Spirit. For as we are wont to riot and exceed in time of peace, the
   Churches are more happy, for the most part, amidst the tumults of war,
   than if they should enjoy what rest they would desire. But and if holy
   conversation, and the consolation of the Spirit, whereby their state
   doth flourish, be taken away, they lose not only their felicity, but
   they come to nought. Therefore, let us learn not to abuse external
   peace in banqueting and idleness; but the more rest we have given us
   from our enemies, to encourage ourselves to go forward in godliness
   whilst we may. And if at any time the Lord let loose the bridle to the
   wicked to trouble us, let the inward consolation of the Spirit be
   sufficient for us. Finally, as well in peace as in war, let us always
   joyfully go forward toward him who hath a reward for us. [631]

   Edification may be taken either for increase; to wit, whilst the
   Churches are augmented with the number of the faithful, or for their
   going forward who are already in the flock; to wit, whilst they have
   new gifts given them, and have greater confirmation of godliness. In
   the first signification it shall be referred unto the persons; in the
   second unto the gifts of the Spirit. I embrace both willingly; that
   there were some every now and then gathered unto the Church who were
   strangers before, and those who were of the household of the Church did
   increase in godliness and other virtues. Furthermore, the metaphor of a
   building is very convenient, because the Church is the temple and house
   of God, and every one of the faithful is also a temple, (1 Timothy
   3:15; 1 Corinthians 3:16.) The two things which follow, that they
   walked in the fear of God, and that they were filled with the
   consolation of the Spirit, are parts of that edification. Therefore,
   though the Churches had peace, yet they were not drunken with delights
   and earthly joy, but, trusting to God's help, they were more emboldened
   to glorify God.

   Acts 9:32-35

   32. And it happened, that whilst Peter walked through all, he came also
   unto the saints which dwelt at Lydda. 33. And he found there a man
   named. AEneas, who had laid in his bed eight years, who had the palsy.
   34. And Peter saith unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ make thee whole:
   arise, and make thy bed. And forthwith he arose. 35. And all those
   which dwelt at Lydda and Assaron saw him, and were turned unto the
   Lord.


   32. Luke setteth down how the Church was increased by miracles. And he
   reciteth two miracles: That a man who had been bedrid eight years,
   having the palsy, was suddenly healed; and that a certain woman was
   raised from death. First, he saith, that as Peter walked throughout
   all, he came to Lydda. And by all understand not Churches, but the
   faithful, because it is in Greek of the masculine gender, though that
   skilleth not much for the sense. And it was meet that the apostles, who
   had no certain place of abode, should wander hither and thither as
   occasion was offered. Wherefore, whilst they are all occupied in divers
   parts, Peter took upon him this charge, whereby the foolishness of the
   Papists is refuted, who gather Peter's primacy by the authority which
   he had to visit; as if the rest of the apostles did live idly at
   Jerusalem like private men, when Peter did visit the Churches. Again,
   admit we grant that Peter was the chief apostle, which thing the
   Scripture showeth oftentimes, doth it thereupon follow that he was the
   head of the world? But would to God the bishop of Rome, who will be
   counted Peter's successor, would travel as he did to animate the
   brethren, and would every where prove indeed that he is the apostle of
   Christ. Now, he which out of his throne doth with more than tyrannous
   lordship oppress all the Churches, pretendeth that Peter did visit the
   Churches with great pains.

   Which dwelt at Lydda. Lydda, which was afterward called Diospolis, was
   situated not far from the Mediterranean Sea, being a renowned city as
   well for antiquity as also for many gifts. Joppa was nigh to this city,
   which had a famous haven, though very full of rocks. The city itself
   stood upon a high cliff, whence they might see to Jerusalem. At this
   day there is nothing to be seen there but the ruinous walls of the old
   city, save only that the haven remaineth, which they call most commonly
   Japhet. It should seem that Luke nameth Assaron as some town or city.
   Jerome mentioneth Saron, and thinketh that thereby is meant the whole
   plain lying between Cesarea and Joppa. But because Jerome showeth no
   reason why he should change the reading which is commonly used, I admit
   that willingly which Luke's text showeth me, to wit, that it was a city
   hard by. But I do not contend about this matter; as I do not
   ambitiously gather those things which may serve for a vain brag,
   because it shall be sufficient for the godly readers to know those
   things which make to Luke's meaning.

   34. Jesus Christ maketh thee whole. It is certain that the apostles
   would never have attempted the doing of miracles, unless they had been
   first certified of the will of God, whereupon the effect did depend.
   For they had no such power of the Spirit given them that they could
   heal whatsoever sick persons they would; but as Christ himself used a
   measure in his miracles, so he would have his apostles to work no more
   than he knew were profitable. Therefore Peter did not rashly break out
   into these words; because he might have set himself to be laughed at,
   unless he had already known the will of God. It may be that he prayed
   apart. The Spirit who was the author of all miracles, and which wrought
   by the hand of Peter, did even then direct his tongue, and did move his
   heart by a secret inspiration. And in these words Peter showeth plainly
   that he is only the minister of the miracle, and that it proceedeth
   from the power of Christ; that he may by this means extol the name of
   Christ alone.

   Make thy bed. These circumstances do amplify the glory of the miracle,
   in that he doth not only recover strength to rise, but is also able to
   make his own bed, who could move no member before. To the same end
   tendeth the continuance of the disease; for a palsy of eight years'
   continuance is not easily cured. In like sort is he said to have laid
   in his bed, that we may know that all his members were lame; for it was
   a little bed wherein they were wont to rest at noon. Whereas AEneas was
   so ready to make trial of his members, he thereby declared the
   obedience of his faith. For although he perceived the strength which
   was given him, [632] yet he was most of all moved with the efficacy of
   the words, to rise.

   35. And all those. His meaning is, that the miracle was published
   abroad, and was known throughout the whole city. For when the Scripture
   saith all, it doth not comprehend every one how many so ever it noteth;
   but it putteth all for the more part, or for many, or for the common
   sort of men. Therefore, the sense is, that whereas there was but a
   small number of godly men there, a great part of the people became
   members of the Church. And in this clause is expressed the fruit of the
   miracle, because they embraced Christ and his gospel. Wherefore those
   men corrupt miracles, whosoever they be, which look only upon men, and
   do not turn their eyes toward this end, that being instructed
   concerning the power and grace of Christ, they may stick only to him.
   Therefore that token of Christ's divine power which he showed was the
   beginning of turning to him. [633]

   Acts 9:36-38

   36. And there was a certain disciple at Joppa called Tabitha, which, if
   you interpret it, is called Dorcas. This woman was full of good works
   and alms which she did. 37. And it happened in those days that she was
   sick, and died. And when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper
   parlour. 38. And forasmuch as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples,
   who had heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, requesting him
   that he would come to them.


   36. There followeth a more famous token of Christ's power, by how much
   it is more hard to restore life to a dead body, than to restore health
   to a man that is sick. But Luke doth first commend the person of
   Tabitha on whom the miracle was showed, and that with a double title;
   to wit, that she was Christ's disciple, and that she approved her faith
   with good works and alms. He hath oftentimes already put this word
   disciple for a Christian man; and lest we should think that that name
   was proper to men only, he attributeth the same to a woman. And this
   title teacheth us that Christianity cannot be without doctrine; and
   that that form of learning is prescribed, that the same Christ may be
   Master to all. This is the chiefest praise, this is the beginning of
   holy life, this is the root of all virtues, to have learned of the Son
   of God the way to live, and the true life. The fruits of good works
   proceed afterward from faith. By good works I mean the duties of love,
   wherewith our neighbors are helped; and Luke placeth the chief kind in
   alms. The commendation of liberality is great, because, as the Holy
   Ghost doth witness, it containeth in itself the sum of a godly and
   perfect life. Now we see what titles Tabitha hath. For religion toward
   God or faith goeth first; secondly, that she exercised herself in
   helping the brethren, and specially in relieving the poverty of the
   poor. For by use it is come to pass, that all that help wherewith the
   poor, and those which are in misery, are helped, is called eleemosune.
   Tabitha is rather a Syrian word than an Hebrew, which Luke did turn
   into Greek, that we might know that it was not like to the virtues of
   the holy women, and that she was debased in such a simple name; [634]
   for Dorcas signifieth a goat; but the holiness of her life did easily
   wipe away the blot of a name not very seemly.

   37. It happened that she was sick. He saith in plain words that she was
   sick, that he may the more plainly express her death which followed. To
   the same end he saith that the corpse was washed and laid in an upper
   chamber; therefore, these circumstances serve to make the miracle to be
   believed. Whereas they carry her not straightway to the grave, but lay
   her in the upper part of the house, that they may keep her there, we
   may thereby gather that they had some hope of recovering her life. It
   is likely that the rite of washing, whereof Luke maketh mention, was
   most ancient; and I do not doubt but that it came from the holy fathers
   by continual course of times, as if it had been delivered from hand to
   hand, that in death itself some visible and of the resurrection might
   comfort the minds of the godly, and lift them up unto some good hope;
   to wit, seeing the manifestation of eternal life was not so evident,
   yea, seeing that Christ, the pledge and substance of eternal life, was
   not as yet revealed, it was requisite that both the obscurity of
   doctrine, and also the absence of Christ, should be supplied by such
   helps. Therefore they washed the bodies of the dead, that they might
   once [635] stand before the judgment-seat of God, being clean. [636]
   Finally, there was the same reason for washing the dead which was for
   the living; the daily washing put them in mind of this, that no man can
   please God save he who should be purged from his filthiness. So, in the
   rite of burying, God would have some sign extant whereby men might be
   admonished that they went polluted out of this life by reason of that
   filthiness which they had gathered in the world. Washing did no more
   help those which were dead than burial, but it was used to teach the
   living; [637] for because death hath some show of destruction, lest it
   should extinguish the faith of the resurrection, it was requisite that
   contrary shows should be set against it, that they might represent life
   in death. The Gentiles also took to themselves this ceremony, for which
   cause Ennius saith, A good woman did wash and anoint Tarquinius's
   corpse. But (their) imitation was but apish [638] in this thing, as in
   all other ceremonies. And Christians also have taken to themselves this
   example unadvisedly, as if the observation of a figure used under the
   law ought to continue always; for at the beginning of the gospel,
   although the necessity were abolished, yet the use was lawful, until
   such time as it might grow out of use in tract of time. But the monks
   do at this day no less imitate Judaism than did the Gentiles in times
   past, without choice and judgment, for they wash corpses, that they may
   bury Christ in shadows, which, being buried with him in his grave,
   ought never to have been used any more.

   38. The disciples, which had heard, The washing of the corpse showeth
   that the disciples knew not what would come to pass, for by this means
   they make the corpse ready to be buried. Yet this is some token of
   hope, that they lay her in an upper chamber, and send to Peter.
   Furthermore, they murmur not against God, neither do they cry out that
   it is an unmeet thing; but they humbly crave God's help, not that they
   will make Tabitha immortal, but their only desire is to have her life
   prolonged for a time, that she may yet profit the Church.

   Acts 9:39-43

   39. And Peter arose and came with them, whom, when he was come, they
   brought into the upper chamber, and all the widows stood about her
   weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made when she
   was with them. 40. And when they were all put out, Peter kneeled down
   and prayed; and, turning himself toward the corpse, he said, Tabitha,
   arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 41.
   And he reached out his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called
   the saints and widows, he restored [exhibited] her alive. 42. That was
   noised through all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 43. And it
   happened that he stayed many days at Joppa with a certain man, named
   Simon, a tanner.


   39. And Peter arose. It is doubtful whether the messengers declared to
   Peter the (matter and) cause why they fet [sent for] him; yet it is
   more like to be true, that they requested him absolutely that he would
   come to work a miracle. But there ariseth another question, whether he
   knew God's purpose or not? First, if he should mistrust the success, he
   should go with them unadvisedly? I answer, although he did not yet know
   what the Lord would do, yet can he not be blamed for yielding to the
   request of the brethren. Also, there were other reasons why he should
   come; to wit, to mitigate their sorrow; to strengthen them with godly
   exhortations, lest they should faint, being discouraged with the death
   of one woman; to establish the Church, which was as yet tender, and but
   as it were an infant. Lastly, this one thing ought to have been
   sufficient for him, because in refusing he should have been thought
   proudly to despise his brethren, notwithstanding we must know this
   also, that so often as the Lord determined to work some miracle by his
   apostles, he did always direct them by the secret motion of the Spirit.
   I do not doubt but that although Peter were not yet certain of the life
   of Tabitha, yet did he undoubtedly perceive that God was his guide and
   conductor in that journey, so that he addressed himself to go not
   unadvisedly, though being uncertain of the event. [639]

   All the widows. Luke expresseth in this place the cause for which
   Tabitha was raised from death; to wit because God pitied the poor, and
   did at their desire restore the woman to life. There were also other
   ends. For seeing she liveth two lives, those virtues which Luke
   commended before are adorned in her person, but the chief end is, that
   the glory of Christ may be set forth. For God could have kept her alive
   longer; neither doth he change his purpose, as being moved with
   repentance when he doth restore her to life again, but because many of
   the disciples were weak and novices, who had need of confirmation, God
   declareth by the second life of Tabitha, that his Son is author of
   life. Therefore God did respect the poor and widows in such sort, that,
   by relieving their poverty, he established in their minds the faith of
   his gospel; for in this miracle he gave ample matter of profiting.

   40. When they were all put forth. When as he taketh a time to pray, he
   seemeth as yet to doubt what will be the end. When he healed AEneas he
   brake out into these words, without making any stop, AEneas, Jesus
   Christ make thee whole. But as the operation of the Spirit is not
   always alike and the same, it may be that though he knew the power of
   God, yet he went forward unto the miracle by degrees. Yet it seemeth to
   be an absurd thing, that he putteth all the saints out of the chamber,
   for whom it had been better to have seen it with their eyes. But
   because the Lord had not as yet revealed the time when, and the manner
   how, he would show forth his power, he desired to be alone, that he
   might the more fitly pray. Also it might be, that he knew some other
   reason which moved him to do this, which we know not. It is recorded in
   the Sacred History, (1 Kings 17:23,) that Elias did the same. For he
   being alone, and not so much as the mother of the child with him, doth
   stretch himself thrice upon the dead corpse. For the Spirit of God hath
   his vehement motions, which, if any man will square out according to
   the common use of men, or measure by the sense of the flesh, he shall
   do wickedly and unjustly. We must this think, when as Peter, as it were
   doubting, seeketh a by place, he preventeth superstition, lest any man
   should ascribe to his power the work of God, whereof he was only a
   minister, For he which withdrew himself from company, and did pray so
   instantly, did plainly confess that the matter was not in his own hand.
   Therefore, when Peter wisheth to know what pleaseth the Lord, he
   confesseth that he alone was the author of the work. Kneeling in time
   of prayer is a token of humility, which hath a double profit, that all
   our members may be applied unto the worship of God, and that the
   external exercise of the body may help the weakness of the mind; but we
   must take heed so often as we kneel down, that the inward submission of
   the heart be answerable to the ceremony, that it be not vain and false.
   [640]

   Turning towards the corpse. This seemeth also to be contrary to reason,
   that he speaketh unto a corpse without feeling; but this speaking unto
   the dead corpse was one point of the vehemency whereunto the Spirit of
   God enforced Peter. And if any man desire a reason, this form of speech
   doth more lively express the power of God in raising the dead, than if
   it should be said in the third person, let this body receive life again
   and live. Therefore, when as Ezekiel doth shadow the deliverance of the
   people under a figure of the resurrection:

   "O dead bones," (saith he,) "hear the word of the Lord,"
   (Ezekiel 37:4.)

   And Christ saith,

   "The time shall come when the dead shall hear
   the voice of the Son of God,"
   (John 5:25.)

   For this was indeed the voice of Christ, which was uttered by the mouth
   of Peter, and gave [back] breath to the body of Tabitha. The
   circumstances following serve to confirm the certainty of the miracle.

   41. Luke repeateth, again, in the end that she was showed openly to the
   disciples; whence we gather that she was raised again, rather for other
   men's sake than for her own. Brain-sick fellows, [641] who dream that
   the soul of man is only a blast which vanisheth away until the day of
   the resurrection, snatch at this place to prove their doting withal. To
   what end was it (say they) to call back the soul of Tabitha into the
   prison of the body, where it should suffer such misery, if it were
   received into blessed rest? As if it were not lawful for God to have
   respect of his glory as well in death as in life; and as if this were
   not the true felicity of the godly to live and die to him, yea, as if
   Christ were not to us a vantage, as well by living as dying,
   (Philippians 1:21,) when we dedicate ourselves to him. Therefore, there
   shall no inconvenience follow, if the Lord had greater respect to his
   own glory than to Tabitha, although, as the commodity [642] of the
   faithful is always annexed to the glory of God, this turned to her
   greater good that she revived, that she might be a more excellent
   instrument of God's goodness and power.

   42. And many believed. Now appear manifold fruits of the miracle, for
   God comforted the poor, a godly matron was restored to the Church, in
   whose death it suffered great loss, and many are called unto the faith;
   for although Peter were [had been] a minister of so great power, yet he
   keepeth not the men in [on] himself; but doth rather direct them unto
   Christ.

   43. When as he saith that Peter dwelt with a tanner, we may hereby
   gather of what manner of men the church of Joppa did consist, for if
   the chieftains of the city had been converted to Christ, some one of
   them would have lodged Peter; for it had been too cruel a thing to
   suffer an apostle of Christ to be so despised. Therefore, the Lord did
   gather together there, as every where, a church of the common sort of
   men, that he might throw down the pride of the flesh; and also thereby
   appeareth Peter's courtesy, in that he vouchsafeth to lodge with a man
   of that calling; although it seemeth that he was rather a merchant of
   some good estimation, than one of the basest sort of workmen. For Luke
   will say afterwards that there were there some which ministered unto
   Peter, whereby it appeareth that he was well and honestly used.

   Acts 10:1-6

   1. And there was a certain man of Cesarea named Cornelius, a captain
   [centurion] of the band which was called the Italian band; 2. A devout
   man, and one that feared God with his household, and one which gave
   alms to all the people, and which prayed to God continually. 3. He saw
   plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God
   coming in unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius. 4. And beholding, and
   being afraid, he said, What is it, Lord? Then he said to him, Thy
   prayers and thy alms are come up into remembrance before God. 5. And
   now send men to Joppa, and fet [send for] Simon, which is called Peter:
   6. He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house lieth to the sea; he
   shall tell thee what thou must do.


   1. Luke passeth over now unto a worthy [643] history, to wit, that God
   vouchsafeth to advance a stranger, and one uncircumcised, unto singular
   honor above all the Jews, because he doth both send his angel unto him,
   and for his sake bringeth Peter to Cesarea, that he may instruct him in
   the gospel. But first of all Luke showeth what manner of person this
   Cornelius was, for whose cause an angel descended from heaven, and God
   spake to Peter in a vision. He was a captain [centurion] of the Italian
   band; a band [cohort] did consist upon [of] a thousand footmen, and he
   which was chief captain was called a tribune, (or marshal.) Again,
   every hundred had a captain. A legion had for the most part five bands.
   That band was called the Italian band, because the Romans did choose
   soldiers oftentimes from amongst those which dwelt in the provinces;
   but they had the strength of the army [644] out of Italy; therefore,
   Cornelius was an Italian born; but he was at Cesarea with his hundred,
   to guard the city. For the Romans were wont so to distribute their
   places of abode, [645] that every city of renown might have a garrison
   to stay sudden uproars. A rare example that a soldier was so devout
   towards God, so upright and courteous towards men! For at that time the
   Italians, when as they were carried into the provinces to live in
   warfare, ran to and fro like hungry wolves to get some prey; they had
   for the most part no more religion than beasts; they had as great care
   of innocency as cutthroats; for which cause the virtues of Cornelius
   deserve the greater commendation, in that leading a soldier's life,
   which was at that time most corrupt, he served God holily, and lived
   amongst men without doing any hurt or injury. And this is no small
   amplification of his praise, in that casting away superstition wherein
   he was born and brought up, he embraced the pure worship of God; for we
   know what account the Italians made of themselves, and how proudly they
   despised others. And the Jews were at that time in such contempt, that
   for their sakes pure religion was counted infamous, and almost
   execrable. Seeing that none of these things could hinder Cornelius, but
   that forsaking his idols he did embrace the true worship of the true
   God alone, it must needs be that he was endued with rare and singular
   sincerity. Moreover, he could find scarce any thing amongst the Jews
   wherewith he could be allured unto the study of godliness, because
   there was then scarce one amongst a thousand which had even some small
   smattering of the law; and, undoubtedly, Cornelius had lighted upon
   some good worshipper of God, who being sound from corrupt opinions, did
   expound unto him the law faithfully, without mixing any leaven
   therewith; but because Luke giveth him many titles of commendation, we
   must note them all [singly.]

   2. He saith that he was a godly man, and one that feared God; secondly,
   that like a good householder he had a care to instruct his families; he
   praiseth him afterward for the offices of love, because he was
   beneficial [beneficent] toward all the people; and, lastly, that he
   prayed [to] God continually. The sum is this, that Cornelius was a man
   of singular virtues, wherein the integrity of the godly consisteth, so
   that his life was framed, in all points, according to the rule which
   God prescribeth unto us. And because the law is contained in two
   tables, Luke commendeth, in the former place, Cornelius' godliness;
   secondly, he descendeth unto the second part, that he exercised the
   offices of love toward men. This is very profitable to be marked,
   because we have a way to live well described in his person.

   Wherefore, in ordering the life well, let faith and religion be the
   foundation, which being taken away, all other virtues are nothing else
   but smokes. Luke reckoneth up the fear of God and prayer as fruits and
   testimonies of godliness and of the worship of God, and that for good
   causes. For religion cannot be separated from the fear of God and the
   reverence of him, neither can any man be counted godly, save he who
   acknowledging God to be his Father and Lord, doth addict himself wholly
   to him. And let us know that voluntary fear is commended in this place
   when those men submit themselves to God willingly and from their heart,
   who duly consider themselves what is due to him.

   Moreover, because a great part of the world doth, with reigned trifles,
   corrupt and deprave the worship of God, Luke added, for good causes,
   that Cornelius prayed continually; whereby he doth signify, that he
   proved not his godliness only with external ceremonies, but that he
   worshipped God spiritually, when as he exercised himself in prayer. We
   must also note the continuance of his prayer; whence we gather, that he
   did not pray only coldly, after the common custom, but that he was
   earnestly bent to prayer, as the continual benefits of God do exhort us
   and prick us forward thereunto, and the force of faith ought there to
   show itself. Wherefore let every one of us exhort himself to persevere
   in prayer by the example of Cornelius.

   With all his house. We must not lightly pass over this commendation
   that Cornelius had a church in his house. And, surely, a true
   worshipper of God will not suffer so much as in him lieth God to be
   banished from his house. For how unmeet a thing is it for him to
   maintain his own right stoutly, that his wife, children, servants, and
   maids may obey him, and not to regard that God is disobeyed. It shall
   sometimes fall out so that a godly man cannot have even his wife to be
   of his mind; yet he, which ruleth others, must endeavor by all means to
   have God obeyed; and there is nothing more meet than that we should
   consecrate all ours to God as ourselves. Therefore, if a godly man have
   children which are unlike him, or a wife of evil conditions, or lewd
   and wicked servants, let him not wink, nor yet suffer his house to be
   polluted through his slothfulness. The diligence of Cornelius is not so
   much commended as the blessing of God, whereby it came to pass that he
   had his house obedient unto him in godliness. And we must not omit the
   circumstance, that he instructed his family in the fear of God, setting
   light by the fear of danger, which did hang over his head therefore.
   For the Jewish religion was in great contempt; [646] and no citizen of
   Rome might freely [647] receive any strange religion, as they called
   it. Wherefore, although the sincere profession of the gospel be evil
   spoken of in the world, yet is it too corrupt frightfulness [648] if
   that unjust hatred hinder any man from offering his family to God for a
   sacrifice, by godly instruction.

   Giving alms. There is also the figure synecdoche in this member,
   [clause.] For as it was said, even now, that the worship of God was
   proved by prayers, so now, when Luke speaketh of love, he maketh choice
   of one kind; whereby he showeth that Cornelius was a liberal and
   bountiful man. For our godliness ought so to appear to men, that we
   declare that we fear God by using bountifulness and justice. The word
   alms is translated unto those external good works wherewith we help the
   poor, (Isaiah 58:7,) forasmuch as misericordia, or mercy, is the inward
   affection of the heart properly. For from this fountain springeth true
   and well ordered bountifulness, if the troubles and sorrows of our
   brethren do move us to compassion; if, considering the unity which is
   amongst us, we foster and cherish them as we would cherish our own
   flesh, and study to help them as we would help our own members.
   Hypocrites are, indeed, sometimes liberal, or at least bountiful; but
   howsoever they waste all, [649] yet no relief which they shall bestow
   upon the poor shall be worthy to be called by the name of alms. For we
   must hold that of Paul, He which hath no love is nothing, though he
   give all his goods to the poor, (1 Corinthians 13:3.) Let us,
   therefore, learn by this word, that God doth then allow our liberality,
   if we relieve the poverty of the poor, being moved with compassion, and
   if, as it were, with open bowels we bestow that which the liberality of
   God doth give.

   Whereas Luke saith that he gave alms to all the people, it signifieth
   as much as everywhere to the poor; for there were not a few rich men to
   whom to have given had been an absurd thing. But whereas he bestowed so
   liberally upon the Jews, he declared how he agreed with them in
   religion; in which respect Luke saith, shortly after, that he was
   allowed of [650] all the Jews. And if so be it he was such an excellent
   mirror of godliness and holiness, even when he had but a small
   smattering of faith, although he were letted so many ways, [651] ought
   not we to be ashamed who will be accounted most Christian doctors, and
   are yet so cold in the exercises of godliness? If a small sparkle of
   faith prevailed so much in him, what ought the full brightness of
   knowledge to work in us? But howsoever we boast of Christ with full
   mouth, yet how far are we, for the most part, from the example of the
   holy man, so that there appeareth scarce a small shadow of those
   virtues wherewith he was replete? For how loose [652] are we in prayer?
   How slow and sluggish to do the duties of mercy? Yea, many are not only
   letted with filthiness and covetousness from giving liberally so much
   of their own as they ought, but they are so inflamed with a desire
   [653] to have, they are become so beastly through cruelty, [654] that
   they are not afraid to rob the poor of their substance, and to eat
   their very flesh.

   3. He saw in a vision. Luke putteth vision for a kind of oracle coming
   from God, that we may know that Cornelius was brought unto the faith of
   Christ after an heavenly manner. And because men are oftentimes
   deceived with juggling, Luke setteth down the time to avoid all
   suspicion, when he mentioneth the ninth hour. And at that time they
   were wont to divide the day into twelve hours; from the rising of the
   sun until the going down thereof. Whereupon it followeth that it was
   fair daylight when the angel appeared, that the vision might be more
   evident. Although there were always seals added unto visions, that they
   might free the servants of God from fear of illusions, because when he
   appeared in dreams, yet were there such marks of certainty imparted in
   their minds as would not suffer them to doubt.

   4. And he beheld, and was afraid. Luke expresseth his attentiveness in
   plain words, that we may know that it was no vain imagination which
   came upon the man as he was sleeping or doing some other thing. The
   fear wherewith he was taken [655] proceeded from the perceiving of the
   majesty of God; [656] for so soon as men conceive the presence of God,
   they must needs be afraid and cast down with fear. And whereas his
   words do no whit terrify us, that must be imputed to our sluggishness,
   because we do not know nor perceive that it is God which speaketh. But
   the godly, to whom God revealeth himself in his word, do tremble when
   they hear it, as Isaiah saith, (Isaiah 66:2, 5.) Furthermore, the sight
   of God is unto them terrible, not that they may always lie confounded,
   and be swallowed up of fear, but only that they may humbly address
   themselves to reverence him.

   What is it, Lord? It appeareth plainly by this answer, that Cornelius'
   mind was touched with religion; that he knew that he had to deal with
   God. Therefore the common translation hath it evil, [657] Who art thou,
   Lord? And it is likely that that which is there read was put in instead
   of this, forasmuch as in the Greek text there is no doubtfulness,
   whereby the interpreter might be deceived, and all the copies agree
   together in this reading, ti esti. And assuredly, when Cornelius
   perceived that it is God, he submitteth himself to obey; as the answer
   is nothing but a commandment.

   Thy prayers and alms. Because God seemeth to be after a sort deaf,
   unless he answer our petitions by and by, hence cometh that speech,
   that our prayers come unto him, and that he is mindful thereof.
   Furthermore, the angel assigneth this as the cause why God vouchsafeth
   to show to Cornelius the light of his gospel; because he hath heard his
   prayers and accepted his alms. Whence we gather that virtues and good
   works do not only please God, but that they are also adorned with this
   excellent reward, that he heapeth upon us and enricheth us with greater
   gifts for their sakes; according to that, "To him that hath shall be
   given," (Matthew 13:12.) And again,

   "Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful in a few
   things, I will set thee over many things,"
   (Matthew 25:21.)

   For God doth after this sort extol his by a continual course of his
   gifts, as it were by certain steps, until he bring them to the top.

   But the Papists abuse this place two ways; for because God respected
   the prayers and alms of Cornelius, so that he endued him with the faith
   of the gospel, they wrest that unto the preparations which they have
   invented, as if a man did get faith by his own industry and power, and
   did prevent [658] the grace of God by the merits of works. Secondly,
   they gather, generally, that good works are meritorious in such sort,
   that the graces of God are increased in every man as he hath deserved.
   In the former they are too childishly deceived, whilst that they feign
   that the works of Cornelius were acceptable to God before he was
   illuminate by faith. And we need not to fet [seek] a proof far to
   refute their ignorance; for he could obtain nothing by prayer unless
   faith went before, which only openeth the gate for us to pray; and
   Augustine weigheth that well and wisely, who derideth Pelagius, because
   he said that faith was obtained by prayers before it was in man in any
   measure: Who (saith he) will seek a physician save he who is already
   healed in some part? And it is the health of faith which teacheth us to
   knock. Furthermore, the fear of God and godliness do plainly prove that
   he was regenerate by the Spirit. For Ezekiel giveth [659] this praise
   to God alone, that he frameth the hearts of men to fear him, (Ezekiel
   32:40 [sic].) And Isaiah saith, that the Spirit of the fear of God
   resteth in Christ, (Isaiah 11:2,) that we may know that he can be found
   no where save only in his members. Therefore it is too great folly to
   feign a man in the person of Cornelius, who, having nature for his
   guide, can attain unto eternal life, or endeavor to come thither.
   Therefore they reason blockishly, that we are able to prevent the grace
   of God with the merits of works.

   As touching the second error, when as they imagine that every one of us
   is increased with greater graces as he hath deserved, it may easily be
   refuted. First, we deny that we have any good works which God hath not
   freely given us; secondly, we say that the right use of gifts cometh
   from him also and that this is his second grace, that we use his former
   gifts well. Thirdly, we deny that we deserve any thing by our works,
   [660] which are always lame and corrupt. Good works do indeed purchase
   for us the increase of grace, but not by their own desert. For they
   cannot be acceptable to God without pardon, which they obtain by the
   benefit of faith. Wherefore it is faith alone which maketh them
   acceptable. [661] Thus did Cornelius obtain more perfect knowledge of
   Christ by his prayers and alms, but in that he had God to be favorable
   and merciful to his prayers and alms, that did depend upon faith.

   Furthermore, if good works be esteemed [estimated] by faith, it is of
   mercy, and not of merit, that God doth allow [approve] them. For
   because faith findeth no worthy thing in us whereby we can please God,
   it borroweth that of Christ which we want. And this is too perverse,
   that though the Papists have this word merit every now and then in
   their mouths, and cease not to puff up fools with a vain confidence,
   yet they bring nothing whereby the studies of men may be moved to do
   well. For they leave their consciences always in a doubt, and command
   men to doubt whether their words please God or not. Must not men's
   minds need faint when they are possessed with such fear? But as for us,
   though we take merit from works, yet when as we teach that there is a
   reward laid up for them, we prick men forward with an excellent and
   sharp prick, to desire to live well. For we address ourselves then
   joyfully to serve God, when we are persuaded that we lose not our
   labor. And whereas there appeareth at this day no more plentiful
   abundance of the gifts of the Spirit, but that the more part doth
   rather wither away, we must thank our unthankfulhess for that. For as
   God did crown Cornelius' prayers and alms, and holiness, with the most
   precious pearl of his gospel, so there is just cause why he should
   suffer us to starve, being brought unto hungry poverty, when as he
   seeth us abuse the treasure of his gospel wickedly and ungodlily.

   Yet here may a question be asked, Whether faith require the knowledge
   of Christ, or it be content with the simple persuasion of the mercy of
   God? for Cornelius seemeth to have known nothing at all concerning
   Christ. But it may be proved by sound proofs that faith cannot be
   separated from Christ; for if we lay hold upon the bare majesty of God,
   we are rather confounded with his glory, than that we feel any taste of
   his goodness. Therefore, Christ must come between, that the mind of man
   may conceive that God is merciful. And it is not without cause that he
   is called the image of the invisible God, (Colossians 1:15;) because
   the Father offereth himself to be holden in his face alone. Moreover,
   seeing that he is the way, the truth, and the life, (John 14:6;)
   whithersoever thou goest without him, thou shalt be enwrapped on every
   side in errors, and death shall meet you [thee] on every side. We may
   easily answer concerning Cornelius. All spiritual gifts are offered
   unto us in Christ; and especially whence cometh regeneration, save only
   because we are ingrafted into the death of Christ, our old man is
   crucified? (Romans, 6:5, 6.) And if Cornelius were made partaker of the
   Spirit of Christ, there is no cause why we should think that he was
   altogether void of his faith; neither had he so embraced the worship of
   the true God, (whom the Jews alone did worship,) but that he had also
   heard [662] somewhat of the promised Mediator; though the knowledge of
   him were obscure and entangled, yet was it some. Whosoever came at that
   time into Judea he was enforced to hear somewhat of the Messiah, yea,
   there was some fame of him spread through countries which were far off.
   [663] Wherefore, Cornelius must be put in the catalogue of the old
   fathers, who hoped for salvation of the Redeemer before he was
   revealed. And it is properly [664] [improperly] said of Augustine, that
   Peter grounded his faith; whereas it had now before a firm foundation;
   although Augustine thinketh as we do in the thing itself, who affirmeth
   plainly, that Cornelius could not pray unless he had faith, in his Book
   of the Predestination of Saints, and other places.

   5. Now send to Joppa. God dealt most favorably with Cornelius, in that
   he doth not command him to go himself, but to send messengers unto
   Peter, that he may stay quietly at home, and that Peter may endure the
   toil of the journey for his sake. But let us not wonder that Cornelius
   was so courteously handled, seeing that God thrusteth the ministers of
   his word daily upon the unwilling; so that he appeareth of his accord
   to those which do not seek him, as he saith by Isaiah, (Isaiah 65:1.)
   But why doth not the angel rather teach him? [665] For this seemeth an
   inconvenient [666] thing that he resigneth his office to a mortal man;
   for the oracle should have had greater authority than when the gospel
   is preached to him by a mortal man. As when Christ appeared to Paul by
   a vision, he set, notwithstanding, Ananias to teach him, that he might
   by such an example establish the ministry of the preaching of the
   gospel, which he committed to his Church; so now the angel giveth place
   to Peter, that he may execute the office committed unto him by Christ.
   Therefore, whosoever will be the disciple of Christ, and be illuminated
   by the (heavenly) light of the heavenly wisdom, let him not grudge to
   use attentiveness and docility toward the external voice of men, which
   Christ useth as an instrument, and whereunto he will have our faith
   annexed. And we see how sore God hath punished their furious pride,
   who, contemning preaching, have looked for [667] revelations from
   heaven. For since God will be heard in men, the ministers to whom he
   hath given his word [668] cannot be contemned without contempt and
   reproach of him. Nevertheless, I confess that the spirits must be
   proved, (1 John 4:1,) that we hear not without choice whosoever do
   pretend that they are ministers of Christ. But because faith cometh by
   hearing, (Romans 10:17,) no man shall attain thereunto which shall
   refuse and despise the word when it is preached,

   Acts 10:7-16

   7. And after that the angel which spake to Cornelius was departed, he
   called two of his servants, and a godly soldier, of those which did
   wait on him: 8. And when he had told them all things, he sent them to
   Joppa. 9. On the morrow, as they journeyed, and drew nigh to the city,
   Peter went up into the highest part of the house to pray, about the
   sixth hour; 10. And he was fasting; therefore he would eat. And in the
   mean season, while they made ready, there fell upon him an excess of
   mind. [669] 11. He saw heaven open, and a vessel coming down upon him
   like to a great sheet, knit at the four corners, and let down to the
   earth; 12. Wherein were all four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild
   beasts, and creeping things, and birds of heaven. 13. And there came a
   voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. 14. And Peter said, Not so,
   Lord; because I have never eaten any common or unclean thing. 15. And
   the voice said to him again, Make not thou those things common which
   God hath made clean. 16. And this was done thrice; and the vessel was
   taken up again into heaven.


   7. And after that the angel. Luke declareth here how ready Cornelius
   was to obey when as he maketh no tarriance, but doth that with all
   diligence which he was commanded to do. And this was the cause that he
   was so forward, because he believed the promise; as want of faith is
   the cause why we are so slow to follow God. Angels come not flying to
   us from heaven that they may appoint us certain men, but that voice of
   Christ soundeth in all men's cars.

   "Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you,"
   (Matthew 7:7.)

   How is it that of an hundred scarce one or two will stir one foot, that
   some creep so little that they profit but a little, but because we do
   not indeed believe the promise? Therefore, let us learn that we must
   not drive off from day to day, but every man must hasten thither
   whither he is called, so soon as he heareth the voice of God.

   Two of his servants. Cornelius had this reward for being so diligent in
   teaching his family, that he had faithful and honest servants who were
   willing to do him service; and also such as that he might commit any
   thing to them. On the other side, the Lord doth oftentimes punish
   masters with just punishments who have no regard to instruct their
   families. For they find those justly stubborn and unfaithful whom they
   would not frame unto godliness and the fear of God, and also they are
   afraid of their treachery.

   A godly soldier. Forasmuch as this soldier was much conversant with
   Cornelius, he had also taught him to fear God, as well as his household
   servants. It is meet that we call to mind here that which I touched
   before, that there is no kind of life which excuseth us but that we
   must worship God purely. For a soldier's life was at that time most
   corrupt; for they were fallen unto filthy licentiousness, from the
   ancient discipline, and yet the Spirit of God beareth record in this
   place of the godliness of soldiers. Wherefore, there is no cause why
   they should require a calling that is free from worshipping God, under
   color of warfare, who would by one means or other be free from all
   righteousness. If they deny that they can serve God because they be
   soldiers, they shall have these two soldiers meet judges and witnesses
   against them at the last day, who shall condemn them. And in the mean
   season, those brain-sick fellows are condemned who cry that it is
   unlawful for Christians to carry weapons. For these men were warriors,
   and yet godly, and when they embrace Christ they forsake not their
   former kind of life; they cast not away their armor as hurtful, nor yet
   forsake their calling.

   8. Whereas Cornelius expoundeth the whole matter to the soldier and his
   servants, it tendeth to this end, that he may the more encourage them
   to give ear to the commandment, which they see is rather a commandment
   of God than of man; and he is not afraid to make known unto them so
   great a matter whom he had instructed well before.

   9. On the morrow, as they journeyed. As Luke declared that Cornelius
   was admonished by an oracle to send for Peter, so now he setteth down
   another vision, whereby Peter is commanded to come to him. Whereby it
   appeareth that all this matter was governed by the wonderful counsel of
   God, who doth both make Cornelius apt to be taught, yea, he kindleth in
   him a study and desire to learn and, on the other side, maketh Peter
   willing to take in hand to teach him. But we must note the
   circumstances whereby he maketh the history more evident.

   Peter went up upon the house, that he might pray alone by himself; for
   a quiet and lone place is a great help to prayer, which thing Christ
   himself did not omit, that the mind, being free from all things which
   might call it away, might be the more earnest and bent toward God. And
   the Jews had another manner of houses and buildings than we use; for
   they had walks upon the tops of their houses. The sixth hour was then
   noon. And it is not to be doubted but that he got himself to prayer
   then according to his custom. For because we are drawn away with divers
   businesses, [670] and there is no end of turmoiling, unless we bridle
   ourselves, it is good to have certain hours appointed for prayer, not
   because we are tied to hours, but lest we be unmindful of prayer, which
   ought to be preferred before all cares and business. Finally, we must
   think the same thing of time which we think of place; to wit, that they
   are certain remedies whereby our infirmities is holpen; which, if the
   apostles counted fit for them, how much must more the sluggish and slow
   use the same?

   10. Excess of mind. Because our minds are wholly, as it were, set upon
   the earth, to the end Peter might the better comprehend the oracle, it
   was meet that his mind should be, as it were, moved from his place and
   carried up; and by this means was he prepared to receive the oracle,
   when as he is carried up above the world after an unwonted manner.

   11. The opening of heaven signifieth, in my judgment, another thing in
   this place than in the seventh chapter. For it is said there that
   heaven was opened to Stephen, that he did behold the glory of Christ;
   in this place Peter saw our heaven which we see divided, so that a
   sheet came thence.

   12. If any man ask how he could see a great multitude of living
   creatures at once, the question is easily answered. For Luke saith, All
   manner, because there were there divers kinds mixed one with another.
   Therefore he beginneth not at the first kind, that he may prosecute the
   number unto the last. Again, we must not measure this seeing according
   to the manner of men, because the trance gave Peter other eyes. But
   before we go any farther we must know the end of the vision. Some
   dispute more subtilely about the same than the place requireth, in my
   judgment. Therefore, I think that it is generally showed to Peter that
   the difference which God had made in times past is now taken away. And
   as he had put difference between living creatures, so, having chosen to
   himself one people, he counted all nations unclean and profane.

   Now the difference between living creatures being taken away, he
   teacheth by the consequent that there is no such disagreement among men
   any longer as there was in times past, and that there is no difference
   between the Jew and the Grecian. Hereby Peter is admonished that he do
   not abhor the Gentiles as being unclean. Undoubtedly, God meant to
   encourage Peter to come to Cornelius without fear; but he had separated
   one people to himself from the rest, as saith Moses in his song, when
   as the Most High did distribute the nations, he put his lot in Jacob,
   etc., (Deuteronomy 32:9;) therefore he called it his inheritance and
   peculiar people.

   According to this order, it had not been lawful to Peter to bring the
   covenant of salvation unto the Gentiles; for that was to take the
   children's bread and to cast it to dogs, (Matthew 15:26,) unless,
   peradventure, they would be circumcised, and embrace the Jewish
   religion; for it was lawful to receive such as did yield themselves.
   Wherefore, when as the apostles were sent before to preach the gospel,
   they were forbidden to turn in unto the Gentiles, (Matthew 10:5.) And
   forasmuch as the preaching of the gospel is a most holy and weighty
   matter, Peter ought not to have attempted any thing therein with a
   doubting and wavering mind. Therefore, to the end he may be assured of
   his calling, God showeth manifestly, as in a picture, that the legal
   difference between the clean and unclean is abolished; whence he may
   gather that the wall which was heretofore between the Jews and the
   Gentiles is now pulled down. And Paul saith, that it is a mystery hid
   from the beginning of the world, that the Gentiles are made partakers
   of the same salvation with the people of God, and ingrafted into one
   body, (Ephesians 2:16; Ephesians 3:6.)

   Therefore Peter durst never have opened the gate of heaven unto the
   Gentiles, unless God himself had made a plain way and entrance for all
   men, by taking away the wall of separation. I said even now that there
   was no time wherein it was not lawful to admit the Gentiles unto the
   worship of God, so they were circumcised; but so long as they continued
   in uncircumcision they were strangers with God. But now God made the
   covenant of life common to all the whole world, which he had shut up in
   one nation, as in a treasure. Whence we gather that this vision is not
   a little profitable for us; for, when as it teacheth that the
   difference between Jews and Gentiles continued only for a season, it is
   as much as if God should pronounce from heaven that he receiveth all
   people of the world into favor, that he may be God over all. Finally,
   we have an evident proclamation from heaven, which putteth us in hope
   of eternal life.

   But some men will object that Peter was taught before concerning this
   matter; for he and the rest were commanded to preach the gospel
   throughout the whole world, (Mark 16:15.) Therefore, he was either
   ignorant of his calling, or else this vision was superfluous. I answer,
   that there was such and so great difficulty in the novelty itself, that
   they could not acquaint themselves therewith by and by. They knew both
   the prophecies of the prophets, and the late commandment of Christ
   concerning the calling of the Gentiles by the gospel; but when they
   come to the push, they doubted nevertheless, being stricken with the
   strangeness of the thing. Wherefore, it is no marvel if the Lord
   confirm Peter with a new sign, concerning which thing we must also say
   somewhat as yet in the next chapter.

   13. A voice from heaven. The voice came from heaven as did the sheet,
   that Peter might know that both came from God; neither had the sight
   done him any good, unless God had with this voice made clean those
   things which were before unclean. Whereas some pick an allegory out of
   the word kill, as if God did signify that men are sacrificed to him by
   the spiritual sword of the gospel; I do not prosecute that, but
   plainness pleaseth me better, that God doth take away by this voice the
   law concerning the choice of beasts, that he may also teach that he
   rejecteth no people, (Romans 15:16.) For if by the former word be meant
   sacrificing, what shall eat signify?

   14. Not so, Lord. This is the voice of him which doth as well refuse,
   as also object to God his own commandment; for he is afraid, for good
   causes, to touch that which he knew was forbidden him in the law of
   God, (Leviticus 11:21, etc.) Therefore he objecteth to God the law
   which he himself made, lest he should break the same unadvisedly. There
   was a certain show of repugnancy between the law and the vision;
   therefore Peter is not hasty, but desireth first to have his doubt
   dissolved before he depart from observing the law. Yet it is a strange
   matter why Peter resisted more in meats than did Abraham in killing his
   son; for Abraham [might have] had more things to object, (Genesis 22:9,
   10.) I dare not here say that that befell Peter which is too common
   among men, to stand more about outward and small matters than about the
   chief points of the law; I rather make that answer which is out of
   doubt, that Abraham's mind was so persuaded, and that he was furnished
   with such power of the Spirit, that he overcame with 1ofty and heroical
   fortitude all those things which might have hindered him. But the
   Spirit of God wrought slenderly, [671] in Peter; whereby we are taught
   that every small or light thing doth cause us to doubt, unless the Lord
   do furnish us with counsel and constancy to overcome all fear. Yet
   Peter dealeth very godly and very religiously, in that being in doubt
   amidst divers cogitations, he dare do nothing until it better appear
   what he ought to follow. Common signifieth in this place profane. For
   because the Lord (as we have said) had chosen the Jews to be a peculiar
   people, he had prescribed unto them this rite and manner of living,
   that it might distinguish them from the profane Gentiles. Therefore,
   whatsoever the Gentiles did use contrary to the rule of the law, that
   did they call common, because there was nothing pure or holy but that
   which God had appointed for the use of his people.

   15. God hath made clean. He speaketh of meats; but this sentence must
   be extended unto all parts of the life. It is word for word, That which
   God hath made clean, do not thou make profane; but the sense is, It is
   not for us to allow or condemn any thing; but as we stand and fall by
   the judgment of God alone, so is he judge of all things, (Romans 14:4.)
   As touching meats, after the abrogating of the law, God pronounceth
   that they are all pure and clean. If, on the other side, there start up
   a mortal man, making a new difference, forbidding certain, he taketh
   unto himself the authority and power of God by sacrilegious boldness.
   Of this stamp were the old heretics, Montanus, Priscillianus, the
   Donatists, the Tatians, and all the Encratites. Afterwards the Pope, to
   the end he might bind all those sects in a bundle, made a law
   concerning meats. And there is no cause why the patrons of this impiety
   should babble that they do not imagine any uncleanness in meats, but
   that men are forbidden to eat flesh upon certain days, to tame the
   flesh. For seeing they eat such meats as are most fit, both for
   delicacy and also for riot, why do they abstain from eating bacon, as
   from some great offense, save only because they imagine that that is
   unclean and polluted which is forbidden by the law of their idol? With
   like pride doth the tyranny of the Pope rage in all parts of life; for
   there is nothing wherein he layeth not snares to entangle the miserable
   consciences of men. But let us trust to the heavenly oracle, and freely
   despise all his inhibitions. We must always ask the mouth of the Lord,
   that we may thereby be assured what we may lawfully do; forasmuch as it
   was not lawful even for Peter to make that profane which was lawful by
   the Word of God.

   Furthermore, this is a place of great importance to beat down the
   frowardness of men, which they use too much in perverse judgments.
   There is no man almost which doth not grant liberty to himself to judge
   of other men's doings. Now, as we are churlish and malicious, we lean
   more toward the worse part, so that we take from God that which is his.
   This voice alone ought to suffice to correct such boldness, That it is
   not lawful for us to make this or that unclean, but that this power
   belongeth to God alone. And also in these words is given us to
   understand, that the Jews were not therefore the holy people of the
   Lord, because they excelled through their own worthiness, but only by
   reason of God's adoption. Now, after that God had received the Gentiles
   into the society of the covenant, they have all equal right.

   16. This was done thrice. The repetition of the vision served for the
   confirmation of Peter, lest any doubt [672] should remain in his mind.
   Whence we gather how deeply the observing of the law was rooted in his
   mind. And I know no reason why God left him in a dump, [perplexed,]
   until, by the event which followed, he might learn the cause of the
   vision, save only because being astonished he did not desire to know
   what this thing meant; although it was all in good time, that the
   messengers of Cornelius should come shortly after to interpret it. The
   vessel was at length taken up again into heaven, that Peter might be
   certified that this message came from heaven, [God.]

   Acts 10:17-23

   17. And as Peter doubted in himself what vision this should be which he
   had seen, behold, two men, sent from Cornelius, inquiring for Simon's
   house, stood at the door. 18. And when they had called, they asked
   whether Simon, surnamed Peter, did lodge there. 19. And as Peter
   thought upon the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek
   thee. 20. Arise, go down, and go with them, doubting nothing, because I
   have sent them. 21. And when Peter was come down unto the men which
   were sent from Cornelius unto him, he said, Behold, I am he whom ye
   seek. What is the cause wherefore ye come hither? 22. They said to him,
   Cornelius the captain, [centurion,] a just man, and one that feareth
   God, having testimony of all the nation of the Jews, was warned by an
   oracle by a holy angel, that he should call thee into his house, and
   should hear of thee words. 23. Furthermore, when he had called them in,
   he lodged them. [673]


   17. Peter was taught not only by the vision, but also by the Word of
   God; and yet in seeing he saw not, until the Spirit is unto him an
   interpreter; a most excellent mirror of our slackness. Although we be
   yet far unlike to Peter; for we are so far from understanding by and by
   what God will, or to what end he speaketh to us, that many
   interpretations are scarce sufficient for us. But we must also note
   that which Luke addeth, that Peter did think earnestly upon the vision,
   to wit, after that he was come to himself again after his amazedness;
   for this was a token of godly reverence, that he did not carelessly
   suffer the vision to escape him. Therefore the Lord opened to him when
   he did knock, (Matthew 7:7.) And we are justly plagued for our
   sluggishness, in that we profit no better in the Word of the Lord,
   seeing we are so cold, and have so small desire to inquire.

   20. Go, doubting nothing. The Scripture useth this word often, when it
   will express of what sort the obedience of faith ought to be. So Paul,
   in the fourth chapter to the Romans, (Romans 4:19,) when as he
   commendeth the faith of Abraham, saith, That he doubted not when as the
   Lord promised him seed, being now aged and past hope of children. And
   in the fourteenth, (Romans 14:23,) in treating of meats, he condemneth
   doubting consciences. And it is properly to reason on both sides, (as
   they say,) when as we are carried hither and thither by course, by
   gathering contrary reasons. But we must not follow God with a doubtful
   and wavering, but with a quiet and constant mind. In sum, the Lord will
   have us to attribute so much to him, that when we hear him we dispute
   no longer what we have need to do, but that we set down for a
   certainty, that that must be done which he commandeth. And surely it is
   meet that his will should show us the way, when all clouds are driven
   away, and that it should subdue all our senses unto it, unto willing
   obedience, all reasoning [disputation] being broken off; which is also
   better gathered by the next text. For the reason is added, why it is
   not lawful for Peter to suspend his judgment in an uncertain matter,
   because God is the author of the business; because it is as much as if
   it should be said, that we ought to be content with the beck of God
   alone, that we may obey his commandment. And hereby are we also
   admonished that men's consciences shall by no other means be quiet,
   that they safely do that which they do, than when being taught by the
   Word of God, they determine that they do nothing without his
   commandment and conduct.

   21. Behold, I am he whom ye seek. Luke declareth now how ready Peter
   was to obey; secondly, that he understood at length, by the messengers,
   to what end the vision was showed unto him. For he heareth that he is
   called by Cornelius, a man that is a Gentile, whom he would have
   counted profane, and unworthy of his company, unless his judgment had
   been corrected with this voice, "That which God calleth pure, judge not
   thou to be common." This is to be wise indeed, when as abandoning all
   vain confidence, and correcting our stubbornness, the authority of God
   doth so pull us unto it, and doth so possess our minds, that we count
   nothing right but that which it prescribeth.

   22. Cornelius, a just man. Cornelius' servants commend their master not
   ambitiously, or to the end they may flatter him, but that Peter may the
   less abhor his company. [674] And for this cause they say that he was
   approved of the Jews, that Peter may know that he was not estranged
   from true and sincere godliness. For even those which were
   superstitious, though they served idols, did boast that they were
   worshippers of God. But Cornelius could not have the Jews, who retained
   the worship of the true God alone, to be witnesses of his godliness,
   unless he had professed that he worshipped the God of Abraham with
   them. Furthermore, as this was a rare example, so it ought to have
   moved Peter not a little. Although they lean most of all to this
   argument, that they may persuade him that which they go about, that all
   this matter is governed by the commandment of God, as if they should
   say, That he is not so much called by a mortal man as by God, who had
   so commanded by his angel.

   23. And Peter also, being overcome with the authority of God,
   deliberateth no longer, but lodgeth the men, that he may go with them
   forthwith. So we must meekly submit ourselves to God; and there
   remaineth nothing after that we know his will, but that we run speedily
   thither whither he calleth us. There is no difficulty in the rest.

   Acts 10:23-29

   The day following Peter went forth with them, and certain of the
   brethren that were of Joppa accompanied him. 24. And the next day they
   entered into Cesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, having called his
   kinsfolks and friends together. 26. And when Peter entered in,
   Cornelius meeting him, and falling down at his feet, worshipped him.
   26. But Peter lifted him up, saying, Arise, I am also a man. 27. And
   when he had talked with him, he entered in, and he found many assembled
   together. 28. And he said to them, You know that it is wickedness for a
   man that is a Jew to join himself to a man that is a stranger, or to
   enter in unto him; but God hath showed to me that no man must be called
   common or unclean. 29. For this cause I came without gainsaying, when I
   was called; therefore, I demand for what cause ye have called me.


   The day following he went forth. It should seem that they arrived a
   little before night [675] because they were not as yet entered the city
   at noon, and the vision which was showed thrice asked no small time.
   Therefore, when they had taken their rest all night, they address
   themselves to return. Again, there was a point of courtesy in that some
   of the faithful do accompany Peter, who were sent, as it is to be
   thought, by the whole church, to bring him even to Cesarea. These men
   journey with Peter for goodwill and honor's sake; but the Lord bringeth
   them, that they may be witnesses of his grace. So that they are
   bountifully rewarded for their thankfulness, when as for confirmation
   of their faith they see the kingdom of Christ spread abroad even unto
   the Gentiles.

   24. Cornelius waited for them. Luke doth not only commend the godly
   affection of Cornelius in this point, that he waited earnestly for
   Peter's coming, but because he would have his friends and kinsfolks to
   be companions with him in the faith. This was a thing not without great
   danger, to call together a company of men, that they might embrace a
   new kind of religion. And there wanted not reasons, under color whereof
   he might have flattered [excused] himself; for he was not commanded to
   call others to accompany him, but rather they were passed over, and he
   himself was chosen to be made partaker of so great goodness; but he
   considered with himself how much he was indebted [676] both to the
   glory of God, and also to the salvation of his brethren. He knew that
   it was an unjust thing, and a point of discourtesy, to provide for
   himself alone, and not to regard others. He counted it a point of
   filthy carelessness [677] to hide the treasure of the gospel under the
   ground. Therefore, he did that which the Lord requireth of all his by
   Isaiah and Micah, that every one exhort his brother (taking him as it
   were by the hand) unto the faith.

   Therefore, Cornelius hath taught us by his example, that when God
   revealeth himself unto us we must not choke the light of his knowledge
   with sloth or fear, but we must rather endeavor that our faith may
   shine before others to give light, and to show the way to them; for the
   inheritance of the kingdom of heaven is not such, that even the least
   portion can be taken from us, if many be made partakers thereof; but if
   others be made co-heirs with us, it shall rather increase our glory,
   Furthermore, we must mark how far he is from vainglory; for he calleth
   them to be his school-fellows, being himself ready to learn. This is
   the true study of godliness, when as together with zeal there appeareth
   such plainness, [678] that we are not ashamed to depend upon the mouth
   of God. For many are pricked forward with ambition, to employ
   themselves in teaching the ignorant; and foolish babbling discovereth
   their folly, when as they huddle out words more earnestly, and they
   would have none heard but themselves. But this alone ought to be the
   drift of all men, to bring themselves and all the whole world under
   God, that when men are subdued unto true humility, he alone may have
   the preeminence. Let not him which excelleth in the faculty and grace
   of teaching refuse to teach his brethren, so that he be free from
   boasting, and proud desire to excel. Let him to whom it was not granted
   to be a teacher keep himself within his bounds. Let neither of them
   desire mastership, as James teacheth them; but let one so edify
   another, that neither the learned, neither the unlearned, be ashamed to
   be brought into order.

   Notwithstanding, it is demanded, [679] what kinsfolks he could have in
   Judea, seeing that he was an alien, and was come thither only by reason
   of war, which continued but for a short time? As I affirm nothing, so I
   embrace this as most probable, that he had some in his garrison which
   were his kinsmen; for neighbors, and those which were of acquaintance
   were wont to serve under one captain. And we need not doubt of this,
   but that Cornelius' kinsmen were desirous to be under him, forasmuch as
   he was a centurion. He calleth familiar friends anankaious, as those
   are called of the Latins, Necessarii, which are nearer together. [680]

   25. Falling down at his feet, he worshipped. Here is the word
   prosekunesen, which signifieth to testify honor or worship, either by
   bowing the knee or ducking down the head, or by any other gesture. Now,
   the question is, whether Peter refuteth this worship for modesty's sake
   only, or he disalloweth it as a thing altogether unlawful? It appeareth
   that Cornelius' fact displeased Peter, by the reason which is by and by
   added, Arise, for even I am a man. For we may gather that there was
   some divine thing in that worship, because he did ascribe unto mortal
   man the honor which is due to God alone. But we must not think that
   Cornelius did count Peter instead of God; for if he translated God's
   honor unto mortal man, where is that godliness and religion, with the
   title whereof he was of late adorned? Therefore, I think that he meant
   nothing less than to spoil God of his lawful worship, that he might
   give it to man; but forasmuch as he meant to give singular honor unto
   the prophet and apostle of Christ, he fell into an immoderate token of
   reverence, and so he offended in excess.

   For it can scarce be expressed in words how prone men are to fall to
   superstition, when as that honor is given to the ministers of Christ,
   which hath any small show of divine worship; for we fall easily
   unawares into that whereof we thought full little. There were less
   danger in a king or in the chief chieftains of this world; for he which
   falleth down before a king keepeth himself within the bounds of earthly
   and civil honor. But the case standeth otherwise in the ministers of
   Christ; for as their office is spiritual, so if any man fall down at
   their feet to worship them, this honor hath in it some spiritual thing.
   For we must put a difference between civil worship, which men use among
   themselves in respect of civil order, and that under which is contained
   religion, or which respecteth directly the honor of God; as also
   between laws which are made for temporal regimen, or which bind the
   conscience. For certain foolish men are deceived too far, who think
   that kneeling is in this place condemned simply and of itself. But this
   is that which I said, Cornelius doth not here salute his proconsul, or
   the emperor, after any civil sort; but being stricken with wondering
   when he saw Peter, he honoreth him as he would have honored God, if he
   had been present; so that he giveth man more than is meet, having, as
   it were, forgotten himself. He thought nothing less (as I have already
   said) than to rob God of any part of his honor, that he might give that
   to man which he took from him. But when as the worship which is given
   to man hath somewhat which is, as it were, linked with the honor of
   God, men fall into a fault contrary to their hope and opinion, so that
   they extol man above his degree, and give him the worship which is due
   to God.

   The Papists, omitting that distinction, snatch only at one member for
   they handle religious worship only. To the end they may ascribe some
   part thereof, with some honest color, unto creatures, they cut
   [subdivide] it into latria, dulia, and hyperdulia. They give latria to
   God alone; as if they should say, that the adoration of worship is due
   to him alone. They make dulia common to the dead and their bones, to
   images and pictures. They assign their hyperdulia to the Virgin Mary,
   and to the cross whereon Christ hanged. That I may omit to say that
   they babble through childish ignorance, how many of them do understand
   that rotten distinction? Neither do I speak only of the common sort,
   but of the chieftains. Therefore, all their worshippings must needs be
   infected and corrupt with wicked superstition, seeing they unadvisedly
   match creatures with God. But Luke saith not in this place that
   Cornelius gave to Peter latria, (or the honor due to God;) he useth
   only the general word worshipped, and he addeth, notwithstanding, that
   he was reproved, because he did wickedly extol man higher than became
   him. Surely, if that new opinion concerning the adoration which is
   called dulia had any place, Peter ought to have admonished Cornelius
   that he should not go beyond dulia. But because no worship whereunto
   religion is annexed, and the respect of God's honor, doth leave to God
   his honor untouched, what man soever it have; therefore, Peter is
   content with this one only reason that he is a man. Moreover, I would
   gladly know of the Papists, whether they think that John was so
   blockish, that he would take the honor due to God, which they call
   latria, and give it to the angel? Surely, there was nothing else that
   caused him to worship the angel, save only too much and preposterous
   reverence, and that in honor of God, whose glory shone in the angel;
   notwithstanding his fact is condemned. Therefore, to the end we may
   give God that which is his own, let the spiritual worship, under which
   is comprehended religion, remain whole and sound to him.

   28. Ye know that it is not lawful. This seemeth to be no friendly
   preface, and such as may rather harden [681] than win their hearts,
   when as they hear that they are accounted so unclean, that with their
   familiarity and conference they pollute the saints; which must needs be
   a great reproach for them. But it was needful for Peter thus to speak,
   lest they should suspect that he had an evil conscience, because,
   contrary to the custom delivered by the fathers, he came. [682] But
   when as he affirmeth that he was sent of God, all such suspicion is
   taken away and purged. Moreover, he mitigateth very well by these words
   the offense which did stick in their minds, by reason of an old grudge
   which was between the Jews and the Gentiles, so that he could by no
   means have entered his speech better, For he pronounceth that those are
   now clean who were before unclean, so that they have mutual fellowship
   now with the saints. Furthermore, whereas he said that it was
   wickedness for the Jews to go in unto the Gentiles, we must know that
   this came not so much from the law, as from the observation of the
   fathers. God had forbidden, indeed, that they should (not) entangle
   themselves with marriages or covenants, (Deuteronomy 7:3;) they were
   never forbidden to eat with them, or to use the common businesses of
   life. But lest that familiarity might entice them into that which was
   forbidden, they observed the custom delivered by the fathers, so that
   they did not company together. It is to no end to dispute here whether
   that tradition did bind men's consciences; for Peter doth not teach
   [683] what is lawful according to God, but what was commonly used.

   No man. He maketh the sum and end of the vision more plain, when he
   referreth that unto men which was spoken of meats. And whereas he
   saith, that no man is unclean, it may not be understood of (all)
   particular persons; for it is certain that all unbelievers are polluted
   with uncleanness of conscience, so that they pollute those things which
   are otherwise pure, when as they do but touch them. Paul also saith
   that their children remain unclean until they be cleansed by faith.
   Finally, if faith alone do purge and purify the hearts of men, unbelief
   doth make the same profane. But Peter [684] compareth the Jews and the
   Gentiles together in this place; and because the wall of separation was
   pulled down, and the covenant of life [685] is now common to them both
   alike, he saith that those are not to be counted aliens who are made
   partakers of God's adoption.

   29. We must also note that which he addeth, that he came without
   gainsaying, For this is the holy silence of faith, when as without
   murmuring against God we receive that meekly which he commandeth,
   abandoning [686] all contrary reasons which intrude themselves.

   Acts 10:30-33

   30. Then saith Cornelius, Four days ago, until this hour, I was
   fasting; and about the ninth hour I prayed at my house; and behold a
   man stood before me in a shining garment, 31. Who said, Cornelius, thy
   prayer is heard, and thy alms is come into remembrance before God. 32.
   Therefore send men to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter;
   this man lodgeth in the house of Simon the tanner; when he shall be
   present he shall speak to thee. 33. Therefore, after that hour I sent
   unto thee, and thou hast done well that thou art come, Therefore, all
   we are now present before God, to hear all things which are appointed
   for thee of God.


   Because this answer of Cornelius containeth only the bare repetition of
   the history, I shall not need to stand long about that. The sum is,
   that he called Peter at the commandment of God.

   30. I was fasting. Many Greek books [687] have emen, I sat. The old
   interpreter omitteth the word fasting, which I think was done through
   error or negligence, because it is expressed in all the Greek books.
   [688] Furthermore, he maketh express mention of fasting, partly that we
   may know that he prayed not coldly, or overfields [689] at that time;
   secondly, that the vision may be the less suspected. For doubtless the
   brain of a man that is fasting (where there is moderate sobriety) doth
   not easily admit any strong imaginations, wherein appear images and
   strange forms, whereby men are deceived. [690] Therefore Cornelius'
   meaning is, that he was earnestly bent to pray, at such time as the
   angel appeared to him, and that his mind was free from all such lets
   which use to make men subject to fantasies and imaginations. [691] And
   to the same end tendeth the circumstance of time, that this was done
   when it was now fair daylight, three hours before the going down of the
   sun.

   A man stood in shining garment. He calleth him a man, whom he knew was
   an angel of God; but it is a common thing for the name of the visible
   form wherein God or his angels appear to be translated unto him or
   them; so Moses doth sometimes call them angels, and sometimes men,
   which appeared to Abraham in shape of men. The shining garment was a
   token of heavenly glory, and, as it were a sign of the divine Majesty
   which appeared [692] in the angel. The evangelists declare, that there
   was such brightness in Christ's garment when he showed his glory to the
   three disciples in the mount. The same thing do they witness of the
   angels which were sent to testify Christ's resurrection. For, as the
   Lord beareth with our infirmity thus far that he commandeth his angels
   to descend under form of our flesh, so he casteth out upon them certain
   beams of his glory, that the commandments which he hath committed to
   them may be the more reverenced and believed. Here ariseth a question,
   whether that were a true and natural body, and whether that were a
   garment in deed, or Cornelius did only see such a shape and show; and
   though this be not so necessary to be known, and we can scarce affirm
   any thing for a truth, [693] yet it seemeth to me more probable as
   touching conjecture, that God to whom it belongeth to create all things
   gave to the angel a true body, and did clothe the same with a most
   gorgeous garment; but so soon as the angel had ended his embassage, I
   think he was restored to his own nature, the body and garment being
   brought to nought, and that he suffered no human thing [694] so long as
   he was in the shape of man.

   33. Therefore, we are all now present. To the end Peter may be more
   ready and willing to teach, Cornelius affirmeth that himself and the
   rest will be apt to be taught, and ready to obey God; for this serveth
   not a little to move the teacher to take pains with the hearers, when
   as he hopeth assuredly that they shall profit thereby, These words,
   before God, may have a double meaning; they may either be an oath, or
   Cornelius may thereby simply profess that that company was gathered
   together at his house, as in the sight of God, that they may hear man's
   voice in like sort as if it proceeded out of God's own mouth.
   Whethersoever you choose, there shall be always one end; [695] for to
   the end Cornelius may the more procure the credit of his sincerity, he
   testifieth that he hath God before his eyes, whom no man may mock by
   dissimulation; and assuredly, so often as the Word of God is set before
   us, we must thus think with ourselves, that we have not to deal with a
   mortal man, but that God is present, and doth call us. For, from this
   respect of God ariseth the majesty of God's word, and reverence in
   hearing the same. Notwithstanding, he seemeth to promise unadvisedly
   for others in a matter so weighty, for who can be a fit borrow
   [cautioner] for another man's faith? But because every man had promised
   obedience for himself, he doth, for good causes, hope that they were so
   affectioned; and, undoubtedly, we may think that they had promised that
   they would be obedient to his sayings so soon as the matter was showed
   them, and that even then every one confirmed by himself that which one
   had spoken in the name of all.

   To hear all things. This only is true faith when we embrace not the one
   half of the Word of God alone, but addict [subject] ourselves wholly
   unto it; and yet, notwithstanding, there be few examples in the world
   of this full and universal faith, for the more part doth not submit
   themselves to the doctrine of God, as if they had made a covenant with
   God, save only so far forth as it pleaseth them. If any thing displease
   them they either carelessly contemn or mislike the same. But Cornelius
   doth wisely distinguish between God and man, for he maketh God the
   author of the doctrine, and leaveth nothing for man besides the
   ministry and embassage. "Thou shalt" saith he, "have attentive
   scholars, and those which will be obedient in all things which God hath
   commanded thee; that he alone may be principal, and thou only his
   minister; that, he alone may speak but out of thy mouth," which thing
   God prescribeth to all his servants in the person of Ezekiel.

   "Take" saith he, "the word out of my mouth, and thou shalt show unto
   them from me,"
   (Ezekiel 33:7.)

   Acts 10:34-38

   34. And Peter opening his mouth said, Of a truth I find that God is no
   accepter of persons: 35. But in every nation he that feareth him, and
   doth righteousness, is accepted of him. 36. Concerning the thing which
   God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ;
   (he is Lord of all:) 37. Ye know how the word was spread throughout all
   Judea, beginning at Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; 38.
   How that God hath anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and
   with power; who went doing good, and healing all those which were
   holden by the devil, because God was with him.


   34. Opening his mouth. We have already said, that the Scripture useth
   this phrase when it doth signify that there was any grave or weighty
   oration or speech made. In the fifth of Matthew, (Matthew 5:1,) it is
   said that Jesus opened his mouth when he would preach to his disciples,
   and intreat of most weighty matters, as if a man should say in Latin,
   he began to speak, having first well bethought himself what he would
   speak.

   In truth I find. Katalambanesthai is to apprehend, or to gather by
   reasons, signs, and conjectures. Cornelius was a Gentile born, yet God
   heareth his prayers; he vouchsafeth to show him the light of the
   gospel; he appointed and sendeth an angel to him particularly; thereby
   doth Peter know that, without respect of persons, those do please God
   which live godly and innocently. For before, (being wholly possessed
   with this prejudice, that the Jews alone were beloved of God, as they
   alone were chosen out of all people,) [nations,] he did not think that
   the grace of God could come unto others. He was not, indeed, so gross
   that he thought that godliness and innocency of life were condemned
   because they were in a man that was a Gentile; but, seeing he did
   simply snatch at that, [696] that all those were estranged from the
   kingdom of God, and were profane, which were uncircumcised, he
   entangleth himself unawares in that so filthy an error, that God did
   despise his pure worship and an holy life, where there was no
   circumcision; because uncircumcision made all virtues unsavory to the
   Jews. By which example, we are taught how greatly we ought to beware of
   prejudices, which make us oftentimes judge amiss.

   Furthermore, we must note what the word person doth signify, because
   many are thereby deceived, whilst that they expound it generally, that
   one man is preferred before another. So Pelagius denied in times past
   that some are chosen and some are [re]proved [697] of God; because God
   did not accept persons. But by this word we must understand the
   external state or appearance, as they call it; and whatsoever is about
   man himself, which doth either bring him in favor, or cause him to be
   hated; riches, nobility, multitude of servants, honor, do make a man to
   be in great favor; poverty, baseness of lineage, and such like things,
   make him to be despised. In this respect, the Lord doth oftentimes
   forbid the accepting of persons, because men cannot judge aright so
   often as external respects do lead them away from the matter. [698] In
   this place, it is referred unto the nation; and the meaning is, that
   circumcision is no let, but that God may allow [699] righteousness in a
   man that is a Gentile. But it shall seem by this means that God did
   respect persons for a time. For, when as he did choose the Jews to be
   his people, passing over the Gentiles, did he not respect persons? I
   answer, that the cause of this difference ought not to be sought in the
   persons of men, but it doth wholly depend upon the hidden counsel of
   God. For, in that he rather adopted Abraham, that with him he might
   make his covenant, than the Egyptians, he did not this being moved with
   any external respect, but (all) the whole cause remained in his
   wonderful counsel. Therefore, God was never tied to persons.

   Notwithstanding, the doubt is not as yet dissolved, [700] because it
   cannot be denied but that circumcision did please God, so that he
   counted him one of his people who had that token of sanctification. But
   we may easily answer this also that circumcision followed after the
   grace of God, forasmuch as it was a seal thereof. Whereupon it
   followeth that it was no cause thereof. Nevertheless, it was unto the
   Jews a pledge of free adoption; in such sort, that uncircumcision did
   not hinder God, but that he might admit what Gentiles he would unto the
   society of the same salvation. But the coming of Christ had this new
   and especial thing, that after that the wall of separation was pulled
   down, (Ephesians. 2:14,) God did embrace the whole world generally. And
   this do the words in every nation import. For so long as Abraham's seed
   was the holy inheritance of God, the Gentiles might seem to be quite
   banished from his kingdom; but when Christ was given to be a light of
   the Gentiles, the covenant of eternal life began to be common to all
   alike.

   35. He which feareth God, and doth righteousness. In these two members
   is comprehended the integrity of all the whole life. For the fear of
   God is nothing else but godliness and religion; and righteousness is
   that equity which men use among themselves, taking heed lest they hurt
   any man, and studying to do good to all men. As the law of God
   consisteth upon [of] these two parts, (which is the rule of good life)
   so no man shall prove himself to God but he which shall refer and
   direct all his actions to this end, neither shall there be any sound
   thing in all offices, [duties,] unless the whole life be grounded in
   the fear of God. But it seemeth that this place doth attribute the
   cause of salvation unto the merits of works. For if works purchase
   favor for us with God, they do also win life for us which is placed in
   the love of God towards us. Some do also catch at the word
   righteousness, that they may prove that we are not justified freely by
   faith, but by works. But this latter thing is too frivolous. For I have
   already showed that it is not taken for the perfect and whole observing
   of the law, but is restrained unto the second table and the offices of
   love. Therefore it is not the universal righteousness whereby a man is
   judged just before God, but that honesty and innocency which respecteth
   men, when as that is given to every man which is his.

   Therefore the question remaineth as yet, whether works win the favor of
   God for us? which that we may answer, we must first note that there is
   a double respect of God in loving men. For seeing we be born the
   children of wrath, (Ephesians 2:3,) God shall be so far from finding
   any thing in us which is worthy of his love, that all our whole nature
   causeth him rather to hate us; in which respect, Paul saith that all
   men are enemies to him until they be reconciled by Christ, (Romans
   5:10.) Therefore the first accepting of God, whereby he receiveth us
   into favor, is altogether free; for there can as yet no respect of
   works be had, seeing all things are corrupt and wicked, and taste of
   [bespeak] their beginning. Now, whom God hath adopted to be his
   children, them doth he also regenerate by his Spirit, and reform in
   them his image: whence riseth that second respect. For God doth not
   find man bare and naked then, and void of all grace, but he knoweth his
   own work in him, yea, himself. Therefore, God accepteth the faithful,
   because they live godly and justly. And we do not deny that God
   accepteth the good works of the saints; but this is another question,
   whether man prevent the grace of God with his merits or no, and
   insinuate himself into his love, or whether he be beloved at the
   beginning, freely and without respect of works, forasmuch as he is
   worthy of nothing else but of hatred. Furthermore, forasmuch as man,
   left to his own nature, can bring nothing but matter of hatred, he must
   needs confess that he is truly beloved; whereupon, it followeth that
   God is to himself the cause that he loveth us, and that he is provoked
   [actuated] with his own mercy, and not with our merits. Secondly, we
   must note, that although the faithful please God after regeneration
   with good works, and their respects of works, yet that is not done with
   the merit of works. For the cleanliness of works is never so exact that
   they can please God without pardon; yea, forasmuch as they have always
   some corruption mixed with them, they are worthy to be refused.
   Therefore, the worthiness of the works doth not cause them to be had in
   estimation, but faith, which borroweth that of Christ which is wanting
   in works.

   36. Concerning the matter. Because the Greek text is abrupt, some think
   that the accusative case is put instead of the nominative; and that the
   sense is this, This is the word which God hath sent unto the children
   of Israel. Other some refer it unto the word ye know, which followeth
   afterward; and they think that there was another word added to make the
   sentence more pleasant. For Luke putteth logon in the former place, and
   afterward rema. But forasmuch as it is common and familiar amongst the
   Grecians to understand [701] the prepositions; this sense, which I have
   set down, seemeth to me more agreeable, though, if the harshness of the
   speech can be any better mitigated, I will willingly yield. Therefore I
   take this member to be a preface, which appertaineth unto this worthy
   work of God, which he showed amongst the children of Israel, preaching
   peace by Christ. That done, there is added a narration. At length, in
   the conclusion of his speech, Peter showeth to what end Christ was sent
   into the world. Furthermore, he beginneth with this commemoration not
   without cause, That God sent his word unto the children of Israel. And
   speech is put for thing in the Hebrew phrase. The eternal covenant
   which God had made with that people was at that time famous. There was
   nothing more commonly known among the Jews than that there was a
   Redeemer promised in times past to the fathers, who should restore
   things which were decayed unto a flourishing and blessed estate. This
   did those also know who were familiarly conversant with the Jews.
   Therefore, to the end Peter may purchase greater credit, he saith that
   he will speak of no new or unknown thing, but of the restoring of the
   Church, which did depend upon the eternal covenant of God, and which
   was now manifestly showed, and almost in every man's mouth.

   Preaching peace. Peter teacheth here what manner [of] rumor and thing
   that was which was spread abroad; to wit, such as that it did make
   peace. I take peace in this place for the reconciling of men and God,
   which, notwithstanding, hath in it the perfect [702] salvation of the
   Church. For, as horrible confusion, and, as it were, a huge lump, [703]
   do follow after that God is once estranged from us; so, so soon as his
   fatherly favor doth once appear, he gathereth his Church together, and
   true felicity ariseth. Therefore, this is Peter's meaning, that God
   showed himself merciful to his people in Christ, and that he received
   into favor Abraham's children again, (whom he seemed to have cast away
   for a time,) that he might establish among them a flourishing estate.
   And as he maketh God the author of this peace, so he placeth Christ in
   the midst as the pledge thereof, that it may be certain and holy. He
   coupleth peace and preaching expressly together, because this is one
   way whereby the fruit of the reconciliation, purchased by Christ,
   cometh unto us. In like sort, after that Paul had taught that Christ is
   our peace, he addeth immediately, that he came to preach peace unto
   those who were nigh at hand and far off, (Ephesians 2:17.)

   37. Ye know how the word. This sermon of Peter consisteth upon [of] two
   members principally; for in the former he reciteth an history;
   secondly, he descendeth unto the fruit of the history). For seeing that
   the coming of Christ into the world, his death and resurrection, are
   the matter of our salvation, Christ cannot otherwise be set before us
   to salvation, than if we first know that he hath put on our flesh; that
   he was in such sort conversant amongst men; that he proved himself, by
   certain testimonies, to be the Son of God; that he was at length nailed
   upon the cross, and raised up from the dead by the power of God. Again,
   lest the knowledge of the history be unprofitable and cold, we must
   also show the end why he came down from his heavenly glory into the
   world, why he suffered such a death so reproachful amongst men, and
   accursed by the mouth of God. The cause of his resurrection must be
   showed, whence the effect and fruit of all these things is gathered; to
   wit, that Christ was humbled, that he might restore us unto perfect
   blessedness who were quite lost; and also that he put on brotherly love
   together with our flesh; that by taking upon him our infirmities, he
   unburdened us thereof; that he made satisfaction for our sins, by the
   sacrifice of his death, that he might purchase the Father's favor for
   us; that when as he had gotten the victory of death, he purchased for
   us eternal life; that he set heaven open for us by his entrance into
   the same; that all the power of the Spirit was poured out upon him,
   that he might enrich us with his abundance, (Isaiah 61:1.)

   This order of teaching doth Peter observe when he beginneth with the
   history of the gospel; and afterward showeth what we have by Christ's
   descending into the earth, by his death and resurrection. First, he
   saith, that Jesus of Nazareth came abroad after John's baptism. For
   because John was appointed to this end, by the counsel of God, that he
   might lift up the minds of the people to wait for Christ, it was not
   meet that this point should be omitted. He was counted an excellent
   prophet of God; therefore his authority was of great importance to make
   Christ to be believed, especially amongst the ignorant and those which
   were but novices. We must note the phrase, that John preached baptism.
   For Luke comprehendeth, indeed, under the word baptism, all the whole
   ministry of John; nevertheless he showeth that it was no dumb sign, and
   void of doctrine. And assuredly this is the chiefest thing in all
   sacraments, that the Word of God may appear engraven there, and that
   the clear voice may sound. For which cause, that wicked profanation
   which is seen in Papistry is so much the more to be detested, because,
   burying preaching, they do only charm the sacraments with magical
   enchantment,

   38. Jesus of Nazareth. He calleth him a Nazarite here, not because he
   was born there, but because he came thence to execute his office;
   again, because he was surnamed thus commonly. He saith that he was
   anointed with the Spirit and power by hypallage. For the power wherein
   Christ exceeded proceeded from the Spirit alone. Therefore, when as the
   heavenly Father anointed his Son, he furnished him with the power of
   his Spirit. Peter saith immediately after, that this power appeared in
   miracles; although he expresseth one kind only in plain words, that
   Christ testified that he was endowed with power of the Holy Ghost that
   he might do good in the world. For it was not meet that the fearful
   power of God should be showed forth in him, but such as might allure
   the world with the sweet taste of goodness and grace to love him and to
   desire him. The metaphor of anointing is usual so often as mention is
   made of the gifts of the Holy Ghost. It is now applied unto the person
   of Christ, because by this means he was consecrated a king and priest
   by his Father. And we know that in time of the law, oil was a solemn
   token of consecration. The going of Christ is taken for the course of
   his calling, as if he should say, that he fulfilled his function until
   the time appointed before. The similitude is taken from travelers which
   go forward in their journey until they come unto the appointed place;
   although he showeth therewithal that he walked through Judea in three
   years, so that no corner was without his good deeds.

   Those which were holden of devils. This also was a more manifest token
   of God's power in Christ, that he did not only heal men of common
   diseases, but did also cure desperate evils. All diseases are indeed
   light punishments [704] wherewith God doth punish us; but when as he
   dealeth more gently with us according to his fatherly kindness, he is
   said to strike us with his hand then; but in more grievous scourges he
   useth Satan as the minister of his wrath, and as it were an hangman.
   And we must diligently mark this distinction; for it were an absurd
   thing to say that he is tormented of the devil who is sick of an ague,
   or of some other common kind of disease; but the alienating of the
   mind, [705] furious madness, and other, as it were, monstrous griefs,
   [evils,] are fitly and properly attributed to Satan. And, in this
   respect, the Scripture useth to call men who are so taken and carried
   headlong with such madness that they have no hold of themselves, so
   that they seem to be turned almost into beasts, men possessed of
   devils.

   Because God was with him. Peter noteth briefly to what end those powers
   did tend which were showed [706] by the hand of Christ, to wit, that
   tie might purchase credit among men, who did behold God as it were
   present; and this was the true use of miracles, as we have said already
   elsewhere, and as we shall see again hereafter when we come to it. For
   we must stay ourselves upon this principle, that we diminish the
   majesty of God unless we embrace and reverence those whom he marketh
   with the mark of his servants. Therefore, forasmuch as powers
   [miracles] did plainly prove that Christ descended from heaven, his
   dignity is placed without the lot of man's judgment.

   Acts 10:39-43

   39. And we are witnesses of all things which he did in the country of
   the Jews, and at Jerusalem, whom they slew, hanging him on a tree. 40.
   Him God raised the third day, and showed him openly, 41. Not unto all
   the people, but to the witnesses appointed before of God for this
   purpose; namely, to us who did eat and drink with him after that he was
   risen from the dead: 42. And he commanded us that we should preach to
   the people, and should testify that he is appointed judge of the quick
   and dead. 43. To this man do all the prophets bear witness, that
   whosoever believeth in him may, through his name, receive remission of
   sins.


   39. And we be witnesses. That he may make his words to be believed, he
   saith, that he and his fellows in office saw with their eyes all those
   things which they spake concerning Christ. [707] Shortly after, he
   taketh the word witness in another sense, when he saith that they were
   appointed witnesses [708] by God, [709] and that they are brought
   forth, as it were, by God, that they might by their preaching bring men
   unto the faith of Christ. So Paul, in the fifteenth of the First to the
   Corinthians, (1 Corinthians 15:15,) saith,

   "We (saith he) should be found false witnesses [of Gods] unless Christ
   were risen from the dead."

   And we have already heard by the mouth of Christ, "Ye shall be my
   witnesses in Judea, Samaria, and at Jerusalem." And now Peter calleth
   himself only an historical witness, because he beheld the things which
   were done. And here he toucheth his death briefly, because it was
   openly known; he standeth longer upon his resurrection, which was more
   doubtful, and the knowledge whereof was more available unto faith.

   41. If any man demand here, Why God did not show his Son openly to all
   men after his resurrection? I answer, Although there could no reason be
   showed, yet ought the counsel of God alone to suffice sober and modest
   men, that they may assure themselves without all doubt that that is
   best which God hath thought meet. And yet, assuredly God used this
   moderation to a good end. For the certainty of the resurrection was
   proved by many and firm testimonies, and this was profitable to
   exercise the faith of the godly, to believe the gospel rather than
   their eyes. As touching the wicked and professed enemies of Christ
   seeing that being so often convict they would never yield to God, they
   were unworthy to have Christ to admit them to behold the glow of his
   resurrection. Though even they were sufficiently convict with the
   report of the soldiers, whom they had hired to keep the sepulcher; that
   I may omit other reasons which we may fet out of the Harmony. [710]
   Therefore, let us assure ourselves of this, that the holy apostles were
   chosen by the holy decree of God, that by their testimony the truth of
   Christ's resurrection might stand. Whosoever is not content with this
   approbation, let him take away and overthrow if he can that inviolable
   decree of God, which Peter commendeth to us in this place. And as for
   us, if we covet to have God the sure author of our faith let us learn
   to be content with the witnesses whom in due time he hath brought
   forth, as it were, by his hand, being ordained by him before the world
   was made.

   Who did eat. And here it appeareth what great regard Christ had of our
   rudeness and ignorance, who did abase himself so far for our sake, that
   when he was now endued with heavenly glory, he did yet,
   notwithstanding, eat and drink as a mortal man. Wherefore, there is no
   cause why we should complain that the resurrection of Christ is obscure
   and doubtful; for he suffered his disciples to be slow and hard of
   belief for this cause, that being better confirmed, they might take
   from us all occasion of doubting. Yea, rather, we must endeavor
   ourselves that our unworthiness and unthankfulness do not darken so
   great kindness of the Son of God toward us. But when as the Scripture
   saith, that Christ did eat, curious men move a question, what became of
   that meat? But the answer is easy; that like as it was created out of
   nothing, so was it easily brought to nothing by the divine power of
   Christ. That meat which is taken for the sustenance of the body is
   concocted and afterward digested; but we know that Christ took this
   meat to feed our faith, and in this use was it spent. And those men are
   deceived who think that Christ did only seem to eat, For what good
   could such a visor or vain show have done? [711] For when, as we say
   that Christ was not enforced with any necessity of his own to eat, but
   that he meant only to provide for those that were his, all occasion is
   cut off [712] from the frivolous inventions of men.

   42. And he commanded us. He beginneth in this place to intreat of the
   kingdom of Christ, when he saith that Christ did rise again for this
   cause, that he may once judge the world. For by the same right are the
   government of heaven and earth, and the perpetual government of the
   Church, due to him. He saith that he shall be judge of quick and dead;
   because, when as the dead shall rise again, others also, who shall then
   remain alive, shall be changed in a moment, as Paul teacheth in the
   fifteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians, (1
   Corinthians 15:51, 52,) and in the First to the Thessalonians, and the
   fourth chapter, (1 Thessalonians 4:17.) In the word testify there is
   great weight; because, as men are naturally inclined unto unbelief, the
   simple preaching of the gospel should not be so effectual, unless the
   Lord should establish it with strong protestations. And chiefly, every
   one of us doth feel in himself too much what a hard matter it is both
   to lift up our minds to hope for the coming of Christ, which are
   entangled in earthly snares, and also continually to keep them fixed in
   this meditation, seeing they cease not with their lightness to be
   carried hither and thither continually.

   43. To him bear all the prophets. Luke toucheth and gathereth the sum
   of the sermon briefly, as we have said; therefore is he so short [713]
   in noting the fruit of the history. Let us know that the words uttered
   by Peter are not recited in this place; but that it, is only declared
   of what things he intreated. And we must consider three things, That it
   is the proper office of Christ to reconcile men to God when their sins
   are done away; that we have remission of sins by faith; that this
   doctrine is not new or of late invented, but that it had all the
   prophets of God since the beginning of the world to bear witness of it.

   As touching the first, if God be pleased and pacified by not imputing
   our sins, it appeareth hereby that he hateth and is displeased with all
   mankind, [714] until such time as they begin to please him by free
   pardon. Therefore we are all condemned of sin, which maketh us subject
   to the wrath of God, and bindeth us with the guiltiness of eternal
   death; and because we are destitute of righteousness in ourselves, we
   are taught to flee unto the mercy of God, as unto our only fortress.
   When as he saith that the faithful receive remission of sins, there is
   understood a hidden contrariety between them and God; for God must
   needs offer it of his own accord that the faithful may receive it. When
   as he saith that it is given by the name of Christ, his meaning is,
   that we return into God's favor by the benefit of Christ alone, because
   he hath once reconciled him to us by his death; or, as they say
   commonly, that we obtain forgiveness of sins by Christ's mediation,
   (and coming between,) and by none other means.

   Satan could never blot out of the minds of men the feeling of their
   guiltiness, but that they were always careful to crave pardon at God's
   hands; but forasmuch as there was but one way and means to obtain
   pardon, miserable men, being deluded with the jugglings [impostures] of
   Satan, did invent to themselves wonderful labyrinths, in whose crooks
   and turns they wearied themselves in vain. This first error did first
   lead them away from the right way, because they essayed to deserve
   pardon, which is offered freely, and is received by faith alone.
   Afterward there were innumerable kinds of satisfactions [expiations]
   invented whereby they appeased God. The beginning thereof flowed indeed
   from the Word of God; but forasmuch as when God gave unto the fathers
   the sacrifices and rites of oblations, he shadowed Christ, blind and
   profane men, setting Christ aside, and following a vain shadow, did
   corrupt all that which was God's in sacrifices and satisfactions. [715]
   Wherefore, what sacrifices soever the Gentiles did use since the
   beginning of the world, and those which the Turks and Jews use at this
   day, may be set against Christ as things altogether contrary. The
   Papists are never a whit better, save only that they sprinkle their
   satisfactions with the blood of Christ; but they deal too disorderly
   therein, [716] because, being not content with Christ alone, they
   gather to themselves, on every side, a thousand manner of sacrifices or
   satisfactions. Therefore, whosoever desireth to have remission of sins,
   let him not turn aside from Christ, even the least nail's breadth.

   When as we hear, that we have remission of sins by believing, we must
   understand and know the force and nature of faith, as undoubtedly Peter
   intreated abundantly of this, [viz.] after what sort we must believe in
   Christ. And this is nothing else, but with the sincere affection of the
   mind to embrace him as he is set before us in the gospel; so that faith
   dependeth upon the promises. Yet Peter seemeth to deal amiss, because
   whereas we have two principal things by our Savior Christ, he doth only
   make mention of the one of them; for he speaketh nothing of repentance
   and newness of 1ife, which ought not to be omitted in the sum of the
   gospel. [717] But we may easily answer, That the regeneration of the
   Spirit is comprehended under faith, as it is an effect thereof. For we
   believe in Christ for this cause, partly that he may restore us unto
   the Father's favor by the free imputation of righteousness; partly that
   he may sanctify us by his Spirit, And we know that we are adopted by
   God to be his children upon this condition, that he may govern us by
   his Spirit. Therefore, it was sufficient for Peter to show how men, who
   were by nature estranged from God, do return into favor with him.

   As touching the third member, we need not reckon up all places of the
   prophets, where they set before us Christ to be the mediator, who by
   obtaining pardon for our sins, doth reconcile God to us; but this is
   their common order of teaching, and, as it were, their rule, to call
   back all the godly unto that covenant which God made with Abraham
   putting the mediator between. [718] Furthermore, this point is very
   needful to be known, that the grace which was offered at length by
   Christ is the same which the law and the prophets, in times past,
   delivered unto the fathers to be hoped for. And surely it was of great
   force with Cornelius and such like, who did greatly reverence the law
   and prophets, that they might know that that was performed and
   accomplished in very deed in Christ which was testified in the oracles
   of the prophets. Therefore, to the end the ministers of the Church may
   agree with the prophets in their form of teaching, let them study by
   preaching to set forth Christ; let them continually testify that we
   must seek righteousness at his hands alone, which consisteth upon [of]
   free remission of sins. This is another manner of antiquity than that
   which is showed with great boasting of the Papists, whilst that they
   thrust in the rotten inventions [719] of their satisfactions into the
   place of Christ's blood.

   Acts 10:44-48

   44. And as Peter yet spake these words, the Spirit came down upon all
   which heard the word. 45. And they of the circumcision which believed
   were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the
   Gentiles also were poured out the gifts of the Holy Ghost. 46. For they
   heard them speak with tongues, and glorify God. Then Peter answered,
   47. Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who
   have received the Spirit as well as we? 48. And he commanded them to be
   baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain
   days.


   44. And as Peter yet spake. God declareth now by a new miracle, that
   the doctrine of the gospel is common as well to the Gentiles as to the
   Jews. And this is an excellent seal of the calling of the Gentiles;
   because the Lord would never have vouchsafed to bestow upon the
   Gentiles the graces of his Spirit, unless it had been to declare that
   even they were adopted together into the society of the covenant. These
   gifts, mentioned by Luke, differ indeed from the grace of regeneration;
   and yet, undoubtedly, God did by this means seal both Peter's doctrine,
   and also their faith and godliness which heard him. He saith that they
   were all endowed with the Spirit, like as we saw before, that they came
   all encouraged to learn and obey.

   This visible sign representeth unto us, as it were in a table, what an
   effectual instrument of God's power the preaching of the gospel is; for
   he poured out his Spirit as Peter spake, to the end he might show that
   he sendeth not teachers to that end, that they may beat the air with
   the vain sound of their voice, but that he may work mightily by their
   voice, and may quicken the same by the power of his Spirit, to the
   salvation of the godly. Thus doth Paul put the Galatians (Galatians
   3:2.) in mind, that they received the Holy Ghost by the hearing of
   faith; and in another place he saith that he is the minister of the
   Spirit, and not of the letter, (2 Corinthians 3:6.) The gift of the
   tongues, and other such like things, are ceased long ago in the Church;
   but the spirit of understanding and of regeneration is of force, and
   shall always be of force, which the Lord coupleth with the external
   preaching of the gospel, that he may keep us in reverence of his word,
   and may prevent the deadly dotings, wherein brain-sick fellows enwrap
   themselves, whilst that, forsaking the word, they invent an erroneous
   and wandering spirit. But it doth not, nor shall not, always so fall
   out, that all those which hear the word with their outward ears, do or
   shall also receive the Spirit; and the ministers do seldom light upon
   such hearers as Peter had, who are willing, with one consent, to follow
   God. Yet he bringeth to pass that all the elect feel in themselves the
   consent of the external word, and of the secret power of the Spirit.

   45. The faithful were astonished. He calleth them faithful who were as
   yet possessed with a wicked error. So the Lord doth not by and by wipe
   away all clouds of ignorance from his, and yet they do not darken the
   praise of faith before God, because he pardoneth errors and doth
   vouchsafe to favor it, as if it were pure and plain. And yet it is a
   wonder, that seeing they knew that Peter was sent of God, they would
   now be amazed, as at some strange and new thing, because God giveth the
   grace of his Spirit to those to whom he would have Christ now preached;
   but the sudden change is the cause of this, because, whereas God until
   that day had separated the Gentiles from his people as strangers and
   aliens, he doth now favor them both alike, and lifteth them up into the
   like degree of honor. Although we be also taught by this example, how
   hard a matter it is for us to wind out ourselves out of our errors once
   conceived, especially when they are of any continuance.

   46. For they heard them. He expresseth what gifts of the Spirit were
   poured out upon them, and therewithal he noteth the use; to wit, that
   they had variety of tongues given them, so that they did glorify God
   with many tongues. Also, it may be gathered out of this place, that the
   tongues were given them not only for necessity, seeing the gospel was
   to be preached to strangers and to men of another language, but also to
   be an ornament and worship to the gospel. But ambition did afterward
   corrupt this second use, forasmuch as many did translate that unto pomp
   and vain glory which they had received to set forth the dignity of the
   heavenly wisdom, as Paul doth sharply reprove this fault in the
   Corinthians. Therefore, no marvel if God took away that shortly after
   which he had given, and did not suffer the same to be corrupted with
   longer abuse.

   47. Peter answered. Peter reasoneth from the thing to the sign; for,
   seeing that baptism is an addition or appurtenance of the spiritual
   grace, he which hath received the Spirit is also apt [fit] to receive
   baptism; and this is the (most) lawful order, that the minister admit
   those unto the receiving of the outward sign whom God hath testified to
   be his children by the mark and pledge of his Spirit; so that faith and
   doctrine are first. And whereas unlearned men infer thereupon that
   infants are not to be baptized, it is without all reason. I grant that
   those who are strangers from the Church must be taught before the sign
   of adoption be given them; but I say, that the children of the faithful
   which are born in the Church are from their mother's womb of the
   household of the kingdom of God. Yea, the argument which they use
   preposterously against us do I turn back [retort] upon themselves; for,
   seeing that God hath adopted the children of the faithful before they
   be born, I conclude thereupon that they are not to be defrauded of the
   outward sign; otherwise men shall presume to take that from them which
   God hath granted them. As touching the manifest grace of the Spirit,
   there is no absurdity therein, if [720] it follow after baptism in
   them.

   And as this testimony maketh nothing for maintenance of their error, so
   it doth strongly refute the error of the Papists, who tie the grace of
   the Spirit to the signs, and think that the same is fet [fetched] from
   heaven with enchantments, [721] as those witches did think that they
   did pull down the moon with their charms. But forasmuch as Luke saith
   that these had the Holy Ghost given them who were not as yet baptized,
   he showeth that the Spirit is not included in baptism. Lastly, we must
   note that the apostles were content with water alone when as they did
   baptize, [722] and would to God this plainness had been retained
   amongst their posterity, and that they had not gathered here and there
   divers trifles, whereof baptism is filth in Popery. They think that the
   worthiness of baptism is adorned with oil, salt, spittle, wax-candles,
   whereas they are rather filthy pollutions which corrupt the pure and
   natural [genuine] institution of Christ.

   48. And he commanded them to be baptized. It was not of necessity that
   baptism should be ministered by Peter's hand, as Paul doth likewise
   testify that he baptized few at Corinth, for other ministers might take
   this charge upon them. Whereas he saith, in the name of the Lord, it
   must not be restrained unto the form, as we have said in the third
   chapter; but because Christ is the proper scope of baptism, therefore
   are we said to be baptized in his name. When as Luke saith, last of
   all, that Peter was requested by Cornelius and his kinsmen that he
   would tarry a few days, he commendeth in them their desire to profit.
   They were, indeed, endued with the Holy Ghost; but they were not so
   come to the top, but that confirmation was as yet profitable for them.
   And, according to their example, so often as opportunity to profit
   offereth itself, we must use it diligently; and let us not swell with
   pride, which stoppeth the way before doctrine. [723]

   CHAPTER 11
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 11:1-18

   1. And the apostles and brethren which were in Judea heard that the
   Gentiles also had embraced the word of God. 2. And when Peter was gone
   up to Jerusalem, those which were of the circumcision reasoned with
   him, 3. Saying, Thou wentest in unto men uncircumcised, and hast eaten
   with them. 4. And Peter began, and expounded to them in order, saying,
   5. I was in the city Joppa praying; and being in a trance, I saw a
   vision, to wit, A certain vessel coming down from heaven like a great
   sheet, tied by the four corners, which came even unto me: 6. Which,
   when I considered earnestly, I saw then four-footed beasts of the
   earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and birds of the heaven.
   7. And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. 8.
   Then I said, Not so, Lord: Because there never entered into my mouth
   any common or unclean thing. 9. And the voice answered me the second
   time from heaven, Profane not thou those things which God hath made
   clean. 10. And this was done thrice: and they were all received into
   heaven again. 11. And, behold, the same hour three men stood nigh the
   house wherein I sat, being sent unto me from Cesarea. 12. And the
   Spirit commanded me to go with them, doubting nothing. And they came
   with me, and these six brethren, and we entered the man's house. 13.
   And he told us how he had seen an angel standing at his house, and
   saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is
   Peter; 14. Who shall speak to thee words, whereby thou and all thy
   house shall be saved. 15. Furthermore, when I began to speak, the Holy
   Ghost fell down upon them, even as upon us at the beginning. 16. And I
   remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, John truly hath
   baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. 17.
   Therefore, seeing that God had given them the like gift as unto us,
   which was believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that could let
   [hinder] God? 18. When they had heard these things, they held their
   peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also given unto the
   Gentiles repentance unto life.


   1. And the apostles. Whereas Luke declareth that the fame of one house
   which was converted was spread abroad everywhere amongst the brethren,
   that did arise by reason of admiration; for the Jews accounted it as a
   monster that the Gentiles should be gathered unto them as if they
   should have heard that there had been men made of stones. Again, the
   immoderate love of their nation did hinder them from acknowledging the
   work of God. For we see that through this ambition and pride the Church
   was troubled; because the equality which did diminish their dignity was
   not tolerable. For which cause they did contend stoutly to bring the
   necks of the Gentiles under the yoke. But forasmuch as it was foretold
   by so many prophecies of the prophets, that the Church should be
   gathered of all people after the coming of the Messiah, and forasmuch
   as Christ had given commandment to his apostles touching the preaching
   of the gospel throughout the whole world, how can it be that the
   conversion of a few men should move some, as some strange thing, and
   should terrify other some, as if it were some monster? I answer, that
   whatsoever was foretold touching the calling of the Gentiles, it was so
   taken as if the Gentiles should be made subject to the law of Moses,
   that they might have a place in the Church. But the manner of the
   calling, the beginning whereof they saw then, was not only unknown, but
   it seemed to be quite contrary to reason. For they did dream that it
   was impossible that the Gentiles could be mixed with the sons of
   Abraham, and be made one body with them, (the ceremonies being taken
   away,) but that there should be great injury done to the covenant of
   God; for to what end served the law save only to be the mid wall to
   note out the disagreement? Secondly, because they were acquainted with
   that difference during their whole life, the unlooked-for newness of
   the thing doth so pierce them, that they did forget all that which
   ought to have quieted their minds. Finally, they do not straightway
   comprehend the mystery, which, as Paul teacheth, was unknown to the
   angels from the creation of the world.

   2. They reasoned with him. Obstinacy doth for the most part accompany
   error. This was now a fault having in it too gross ignorance, in that
   they did not quietly receive the Gentiles into their bosom, united to
   them by the same Spirit of faith. But they do not only leap back, but
   also contend with Peter contentiously, and blame him for his fact,
   which deserved great praise. They hear that the Gentiles have embraced
   the Word of God; what letteth them then from embracing them, that they
   may be coupled together [724] under the government of one God? For what
   more holy bond can there be, than when all men, with one consent, are
   coupled and joined to God? And why should not those grow together into
   one body who make the Messiah of God their head? But because they saw
   the external form of the law broken, they thought that heaven and earth
   did go together. [725]

   And note, that although Luke said before that the apostles and brethren
   had heard this fame, yet he spake nothing of offense; but he bringeth
   in now, as it were, a new sect of men, which did contend with Peter.
   The brethren, saith he, heard, and there an end; it followeth, When
   Peter was come to Jerusalem, those which were of the circumcision did
   contend with him, who were undoubtedly unlike to the first; again,
   these words peritomes, do not simply signify the Jews, but those who
   were too much addicted to keeping the ceremonies of the law. For there
   were none of Jerusalem in Christ's flock at that time, save only those
   which were circumcised. From whom, then, could he distinguish those
   men? Lastly, it seemeth to be a thing unlike to be true that the
   apostles, and those which were moderate being of the number of the
   faithful, did attempt this combat. For though they had been offended,
   yet they might have conferred with Peter privately, and have demanded
   some reason of his fact. By these reasons am I moved to think that
   those are said to be of the circumcision who did make so great account
   of circumcision, that they granted no man a place in the kingdom of
   God, unless he took upon him the profession of the law, and, being
   admitted into the Church by this holy rite, did put off uncleanness.

   3. Unto men being uncircumcised. This was not forbidden by the law of
   God, but it was a tradition which came from the fathers. And yet,
   notwithstanding, Peter doth not object that they dealt too hardly [726]
   with him in this point, and that he was not bound by the necessity of
   man's law. He omitteth all this defense, and doth only answer, that
   they came first unto him, and that they were offered unto him, as it
   were, by the hand of God. And here we see the rare modesty of Peter,
   because whereas, trusting to the goodness of the cause, he might have
   justly despised unskillful men, who did trouble him unjustly, yet doth
   he mildly excuse himself as it becometh brethren. This was no small
   trial in that he was unworthily accused, because he had obeyed God
   faithfully. But because he knew that this law was enjoined the whole
   Church, that every man be ready to give an account of his doctrine and
   life so often as the matter requireth, and he remembered that he was
   one of the flock, he doth not only suffer himself to be ruled, but
   submitteth himself willingly to the judgment of the Church. Doctrine,
   indeed, if it be of God, is placed above the chance and die of man's
   judgment; but because the Lord will have prophecy judged, his servants
   must not refuse this condition, that they prove themselves to be such
   as they will be accounted. But we shall see anon how far the defense
   both of doctrine, as also of facts, ought to extend.

   For this present we must know this, that Peter doth willingly answer
   for himself when his fact is reproved. [727] And if the Pope of Rome be
   Peter's successor, why is not he bound by the same law? Admit we grant
   that this submission was voluntary, yet why doth not the successor
   imitate such an example of modesty showed unto him? Although we need no
   long circumstance [728] here; for if that be true which the Popes spew
   out in their sacrilegious decrees, Peter did treacherously betray and
   forsake the privileges of their seat, [See,] and so he betrayed the See
   of Rome. For, after that they have made the Pope the judge of all the
   whole world, affirming that he is not subject to man's judgment; after
   that they have lifted him up above the clouds, that, being free from
   giving an account, his will and pleasure may stand for a reason, [law,]
   they make him forthwith patron of the apostolic seat, [See,] stoutly to
   defend the privileges thereof. Of what great sluggishness shall Peter
   then be condemned, if he did lose his right given him of God, by
   yielding so cowardly? [easily.] Why did not he at least object that he
   was free from the laws, and exempt from the common sort? But he useth
   no such preface, but entereth [on] the cause without making any delay.
   And let us remember, that there is nothing which hindereth us from
   contemning that idol safely, seeing that usurping such unbridled
   tyranny, he hath blotted himself out of the number of the bishops.

   And Peter beginning. Because this narration is all one with [that]
   which we had in the chapter next (going before,) and because it is
   repeated almost in the very same words, if any thing need to be
   expounded let the readers repair thither. The purpose of Peter, and all
   the whole sum of his speech, shall appear by the conclusion. Yet,
   before I come thither, we must briefly mark that he maketh the
   preaching of the gospel the cause of salvation. Thou shalt hear (saith
   he) words wherein thou mayest have salvation, not because salvation is
   included in man's voice, but because God, offering his Son there unto
   eternal life, doth also cause us to enjoy him by faith. This is
   assuredly wonderful goodness of God, who maketh men ministers of life,
   who have nothing but matter of death in themselves, and which are not
   only subject to death in themselves, but are also deadly to others.
   Nevertheless, the filthy unthankfulness of the world betrayeth itself
   in this point, which, loathing true and certain salvation offered unto
   it, and forsaking it when it lieth at the feet, doth imagine divers and
   vain salvations, in seeking which, it had rather gape being hungry,
   [729] than to be filled with the grace of God which meeteth it and is
   present.

   16. I remembered the word of the Lord. We have sufficiently declared in
   the first chapter, that when Christ uttered that sentence, he did not
   make a comparison between two baptisms; but that he intended to declare
   what difference there was between him and John, (Acts 1:5.) For, as we
   distinguish the sign from his [its] truth, so it is good to distinguish
   the minister from the author, lest mortal man challenge [730] that
   which is proper to God. Man hath the sign in his hand; it is Christ
   alone which watereth and regenerateth. For it skilleth much whither
   men's minds be directed in seeking the graces of God, because they
   shall not receive one drop without Christ. Therefore, there is this
   general difference between Christ and all the ministers of the Church,
   because they give the external sign of water, but he fulfilleth and
   performeth the effect of the sign by the power of his Spirit. The
   readers were to be admonished of this thing again in this place,
   because many do falsely infer that John's baptism and ours are not all
   one, whilst that Christ, challenging to himself the Spirit, doth leave
   nothing for John save water alone.

   But if any man trusting to this testimony do make baptism a cold
   spectacle, and void of all grace of the Spirit, he shall be also
   greatly deceived. For the Holy Scripture useth to speak two manner of
   ways of the sacraments. For because Christ is not unfaithful in his
   promises, he doth not suffer that to be vain which he doth institute;
   but when as the Scripture doth attribute to baptism strength to wash
   and regenerate, it ascribeth all this to Christ, and doth only teach
   what he worketh by his Spirit by the hand of man and the visible sign.
   Where Christ is thus joined with the minister, and the efficacy of the
   Spirit with the sign, there is so much attributed to the sacraments as
   is needful, (Titus 3:5;) but that conjunction must not be so confused,
   but that men's minds, being drawn from mortal and frail things, and
   things like to themselves, and from the elements of the world, they
   must learn to seek for salvation at Christ's hand, and to look unto the
   power of his Spirit alone; because he misseth the mark of faith,
   whosoever turneth aside even but a little from the Spirit unto the
   signs; and he is a sacrilegious person who taketh even but an inch of
   Christ's praise, that be may deck man therewith. And we must also
   remember that Christ did comprehend under the word Spirit, not only the
   gift of tongues, and such like things, but all the whole grace of our
   renewing; but because these gifts were an excellent argument of
   Christ's power, this sentence may well be applied unto them. I will
   make this more plain; seeing that Christ did bestow upon the apostles
   the visible graces of the Spirit, he did plainly declare that the
   Spirit was in his hand; so that by this means he did testify, that he
   is the alone author of cleanness, righteousness, and of the whole
   regeneration. And Peter applieth it unto his purpose thus, that
   forasmuch as Christ did go before, carrying with him the force of
   baptism, it became him to follow with the addition, [731] that is, the
   outward sign of water.

   17. Who was I? Now do we see to what end Peter made that narration; to
   wit, that he might declare that God was the author and governor of all
   the whole matter; therefore, the state of the question consisteth in
   [turneth upon] the authority of God, whether meat be not of more weight
   than men's counsels. [732] Peter affirmeth that he did nothing but that
   which was rightly and orderly done, because he obeyed God; he showeth
   that he preached the doctrine of the gospel, neither amiss, neither
   rashly, where Christ bestowed the graces of his Spirit. The approbation
   of our doctrine, and also our deeds, must be brought to this rule so
   often as men call us to an account; for whosoever stayeth himself upon
   the commandment of God, he hath defense enough. If men be not content,
   there is no cause why he should pass for their judgments any more.
   [733] And hereby we gather that the faithful ministers of God's word
   may in such sort give an account of their doctrine, that they may no
   whit impair the credit and certainty thereof; to wit, if they show that
   it was given them by God: but if they shall deal with unjust men, who
   will not be enforced with the reverence of God to yield, let us let
   them alone with their obstinacy, appealing unto the day of the Lord.

   And we must also note, that we do not only resist God by striving
   against him, but also by lingering, if we do not that which our calling
   requireth, and which is proper to it. For Peter saith that he cannot
   deny baptism and brotherly fellowship to the Gentiles, but that he
   should be [without being] an enemy to God. But he should have essayed
   nothing which was manifestly contrary to the grace of God. That is true
   indeed; but he which doth not receive those whom God offereth, and
   shutteth the gate which God openeth, he hindereth the work of God so
   much as in him lieth; as we say at this day, that those men make war
   against God who are set against the baptizing of infants; because they
   most cruelly exclude those out of the Church whom God hath adopted into
   the Church, and they deprive those of the outward sign whom God
   vouchsafeth to call his children. Like unto this is that kind of
   resisting, in that many dissemblers, who, whilst they be magistrates,
   ought to assist, according to their office, the martyrs of Christ, go
   about to stop their mouths, and to take from them their liberty. For
   because they hate the truth, they would have it suppressed.

   18. When they heard these things they were quieted. The end doth show
   that those were not moved with malice which did contend with Peter; for
   this is an evident sign of godliness, in that being thoroughly
   instructed touching the will of God, they cease forthwith to contend.
   By which example we are taught, that those are not to be despised who,
   being offended through unadvised zeal, reprove any thing wrongfully;
   but that their consciences must be appeased by the Word of God, which
   are troubled by error, and that their docility is tried at least thus
   far forth. As touching us, we do hereby, in like sort, learn whereupon
   our judgment must depend, namely, upon the sole and simple beck of God.
   For this honor is due to him, that his will be to us the certain and
   principal rule of truth and justice. So often as it is requisite for us
   to know the cause of any thing, the Lord doth not conceal the same from
   us; but to the end he may accustom our faith unto just obedience, he
   telleth us sometimes simply and plainly that this or that thing
   pleaseth him. He which granteth liberty to himself to inquire farther,
   and taketh a delight in his curiosity, doth nothing else but throw
   himself headlong with devilish boldness. And Luke doth not only declare
   that these men held their peace, but that they gave glory also to God.
   Some are enforced by shame to hold their peace, who, notwithstanding,
   keep in that in their minds which they dare not utter. That is rather a
   dissemblance of modesty than docility. But these men do so thoroughly
   submit themselves to God, that they are not afraid nor ashamed to
   recant by and by, [forthwith.]

   Then hath God. Luke doth briefly declare in these words what the gospel
   containeth, and to what end it tendeth, to wit, that God may reconcile
   men to himself, being renewed by his Spirit. The word repentance alone
   is expressed in this place, but when he addeth unto life, it appeareth
   plainly that it is not separated from faith. Therefore, whosoever will
   rightly profit in the gospel, let him put off the old man, and think
   upon newness of life, (Ephesians 4:22;) that done, let him know for a
   certainty that he is not called in vain unto repentance, but that there
   is salvation prepared for him in Christ. So shall it come to pass, that
   the hope and assurance of salvation shall rest upon the free mercy of
   God alone, and that the forgiveness of sins shall, notwithstanding, be
   no cause of sluggish security. This member, to give repentance, may be
   expounded two manner of ways; either that God granted to the Gentiles
   place for repentance, when as he would have his gospel preached to
   them; or that he circumcised their hearts by his Spirit, as Moses
   saith, (Deuteronomy 30:6,) and made them fleshy hearts of stony hearts,
   as saith Ezekiel, (Ezekiel 11:19.) For it is a work proper to God alone
   to fashion and to beget men again, that they may begin to be new
   creatures; and it agreeth better with this second sense; it is not so
   much racked, and it agreeth better with the phrase [phraseology] of
   Scripture.

   Acts 11:19-24

   19. Those, therefore, which were dispersed by reason of the tribulation
   which happened about Stephen, went into Phenice, and Cyprus, and
   Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to the Jews. 20. And there
   were certain of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, entering into
   Antioch, spake with the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. 21. And the
   hand of the Lord was with them: Therefore a great number, when they
   believed, were turned unto the Lord. 22. And the tidings of them came
   unto the ears of the Church which was at Jerusalem: and they sent
   Barnabas, that he might go to Antioch. 23. Who, when he was come, and
   [had] seen the grace of God, he rejoiced, and did exhort all, that with
   purpose of heart they would continue cleaving to the Lord. 24. Because
   he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and faith. And there was
   a great multitude added unto the Lord.


   19. Those which were scattered abroad. Luke returneth now unto the
   former history, (and unto that which followed in the same.) For he had
   said before that after that Stephen was slain the cruelty of the wicked
   increased; and many fled hither and thither for fear, so that the
   apostles were almost left alone at Jerusalem. Whereas the Church was
   thus torn in pieces, and fear did cause those which were fled to keep
   silence or else contempt of strangers, [734] he declareth that that
   event did follow which no man would have hoped for; for as the seed is
   sown that it may bring forth fruit, so it came to pass through their
   flight and scattering abroad, that the gospel was spread abroad in
   nations which were far off, which was included before within the walls
   of one city, as in a barn. [735] In like sort it came to pass, that the
   name of Christ, passing over mountains and seas, did flow even unto the
   farthest parts of the world; and by this means, according to the
   prophecy of Isaiah, the consumption did abound [736] in righteousness.
   If so many godly men had not been expelled out of Jerusalem, Cyprus had
   heard nothing, Phenice had heard nothing of Christ; yea, Italy and
   Spain, which were farther off, had heard nothing. But the Lord brought
   to pass, that of many torn members did arise more bodies. For how came
   it to pass that there were Churches gathered at Rome and at Puteoli,
   save only because a few exiled men, and such as fled away, [737] had
   brought the gospel thither with them? And as God did at that time make
   the endeavors of Satan frustrate after a wonderful sort, so we need not
   doubt but that even at this day he will make to himself triumphs of the
   cross and persecution, that the Church may better grow together, though
   it be scattered abroad. Phenice joineth to Syria, and is nigh to
   Galilee. Antioch is a most famous city of Syria, at which part it is
   joined to Cilicia.

   Speaking to none. Peradventure they were letted not only with fear of
   persecution, that they durst not speak to the Gentiles, but also with
   that foolish religion, in that they thought that the children's bread
   was thrown to the dogs, (Mark 16:15;) whereas, notwithstanding, Christ
   had commanded that the gospel should be preached to all the world after
   his resurrection.

   20. Luke doth at length declare that certain of them brought this
   treasure even unto the Gentiles. And Luke calleth these Grecians not
   Ellenes, but Ellenistai. Therefore, some say that those came of the
   Jews, yet did they inhabit Greece; which I do not allow. For seeing the
   Jews, whom he mentioned a little before, were partly of Cyprus, they
   must needs be reckoned in that number, because the Jews count Cyprus a
   part of Greece. But Luke distinguisheth them from those, whom he
   calleth afterward Ellenistas. Furthermore, forasmuch as he had said
   that the word was preached at the beginning only to the Jews, and he
   meant those who, being banished out of their own country, did live in
   Cyprus and Phenice, correcting as it were this exception, he saith that
   some of them did teach the Grecians. This contrariety doth cause me to
   expound it of the Gentiles. For Luke's meaning is, that a few did more
   freely preach the gospel, [738] because the calling of the Gentiles was
   not unknown to them. But the constancy of them all deserveth no small
   praise; because, being delivered, as it were, out of the midst of
   death, they are not afraid to do their duty toward God even with
   danger. Whence we gather to what end, and how far forth Christians may
   fly persecution; to wit, that they may spend [739] the residue of their
   life in spreading abroad the glory of God. If any man demand how it
   came to pass that strangers lately coming, and such as might have been
   suspected among all the Jews, and hated of them, because they were
   banished out of Jerusalem, were so bold, I answer, that this came to
   pass through the singular motion of God, and that they consulted
   suddenly according to the occasion offered them. For this deliberation
   is not of flesh and blood.

   21. The hand of the Lord was. Luke proveth by the success that the
   gospel was offered unto the Gentiles also by the brethren of Cyprus and
   Cyrene not rashly nor unadvisedly, because their labor was fruitful and
   profitable. But such increase should never have followed, unless God
   had commanded and favored. Therefore, it followeth that it pleased God
   that the Gentiles should be called. The hand, as it is well known, doth
   signify power and strength. Therefore, this is Luke's meaning, that God
   did testify by his present aid that the Gentiles were called together
   with the Jews, through his direction, to be made partakers of the grace
   of Christ. And this blessing of God served not a little to confirm the
   minds of all men. This place did also teach us, that what pains soever
   the ministers of God take in teaching, it shall be all vain and void,
   unless God bless their labors from heaven. For we may plant and water,
   as Paul teacheth, but the increase cometh from God alone, (1
   Corinthians 3,) in whose hand the hearts of men are, that he may bend
   and frame the same at his pleasure. Therefore, as often as we are to
   intreat of faith, let us always remember this speech, that God wrought
   by his ministers, and that he made their doctrine effectual by his
   hand, that is, by the secret inspiration of the Spirit. Therefore, let
   the minister attempt nothing trusting to his own wit and industry, but
   let him commit his labor to the Lord, upon whose grace the whole
   success dependeth; and where doctrine shall work effectually, let those
   which shall believe thank God for their faith. Furthermore, we must
   note that which Luke saith, that many were turned unto God by faith,
   because he doth very well express the force and nature of faith; that
   it is not idle and cold, [740] but such as restoreth men (who were
   before turned away from God) unto his government, and bindeth them unto
   his righteousness.

   22. And the tidings. If this report had been brought before Peter did
   excuse himself, those good men should have been reproved of many whose
   ministry notwithstanding God had sealed with the grace of his Spirit;
   but that superstition was now wiped away out of their minds, forasmuch
   as God had by evident signs declared that no nation ought to be counted
   profane. Therefore, they contend no longer, neither do they count it a
   point of rashness, that some durst preach Christ unto the Gentiles; but
   by sending help, they testify that they allow that which they had done.
   Furthermore, this was the cause why they sent Barnabas. The apostles
   did at that time bear all the burden of the kingdom of Christ;
   therefore, it was their duty to frame and set in order Churches every
   where; to keep all the faithful, wheresoever dispersed, in the pure
   consent of faith; to appoint ministers and pastors wheresoever there
   was any number of the faithful. The crafty wiliness of Satan is well
   known. So soon as he seeth a gate set open for the gospel, he
   endeavoreth by all means to corrupt that which is sincere, [pure;]
   whereby it came to pass that divers heresies brake out together with
   Christ's doctrine. Therefore, the greater gifts every Church hath, the
   more careful ought it to be, lest Satan mix or trouble any thing
   amongst the ignorant, and those who are not as yet established in the
   right faith; because it is the easiest matter in the world to corrupt
   corn in the blade. To conclude, Barnabas was sent to bring them farther
   forward in the principles of faith; to set things in some certain
   order; to give the building which was begun some form, that there might
   be a lawful state of the Church.

   23. When he had seen the grace of God. By these words Luke teacheth,
   first, that the gospel which they had received was true; secondly, that
   Barnabas sought nothing else but the glory of Christ. For, when he
   saith that he saw the grace of God, and that he exhorted them to go
   forward, hereby we gather that they were well taught. And the joy is a
   testimony of sincere godliness. Ambition is evermore envious and
   malicious; so that we see many seek for praise by reproving other men,
   because they are more desirous of their own glory than of the glory of
   Christ. But the faithful servants of Christ must rejoice (as did
   Barnabas) when they see the gospel increase, by whomsoever God shall
   make his name known. And assuredly those which help one another, so
   that they acknowledge that all the effect which springeth thence is the
   work of God, will never envy one another, neither will they seek to
   carp [at] one another, but will, with one mouth and mind, praise the
   power of God.

   Again, this is worth the noting, that Luke doth attribute the faith of
   the men of Antioch, and whatsoever was worthy [of] praise there, to the
   grace of God. He might have reckoned up all those virtues which might
   make for the commendation of men; but he comprehendeth what excellence
   soever was in that Church under this word grace. Lastly, we must note
   Barnabas' exhortation. We have already said that Barnabas did subscribe
   to the former doctrine which they had embraced; but lest doctrine fall
   away, it is most requisite that it be thoroughly imprinted in the minds
   of the faithful by continual exhortations. For seeing that we have to
   encounter continually with so many and such strong adversaries, and our
   minds are so slippery, unless every man arm himself diligently, it will
   by and by fall away, which thing infinite numbers do show to be true by
   their falling away. Whereas he setteth down this manner of
   perseverance, that they continue with purpose of heart we are hereby
   taught that faith hath taken deep root then when it hath a place in the
   heart. Wherefore it is no marvel, if scarce one of ten of those who
   profess faith do stand unto the end, seeing that very few know what the
   affection and purpose of heart meaneth.

   24. For he was a good man. Barnabas is commended with the commendation
   of the Holy Ghost; yet we must know that there was respect had not so
   much of him as of us. For all those are condemned of ungodliness and
   malice who envy other men's labors, and are grieved when they see the
   same have good success.

   Also we must note the epithet used in the description of a good man,
   full of the Holy Ghost, full of faith. For after that he had said that
   he was an upright and good man, he showed from what fountain this
   goodness did flow; that, abandoning the affections of the flesh, he
   did, with all his heart, embrace godliness, having the Spirit to be his
   guide. But why doth he separate faith from the Spirit, whose gift it
   is? I answer, that it is not named severally, as if it were a diverse
   thing, but it is rather set forth as a principal token, whereby it
   might appear that Barnabas was full of the Holy Ghost.

   There was a great multitude added. Though the number of the godly was
   already great, yet Luke saith that it was increased by Barnabas'
   coming. Thus doth the building of the Church go forward when one doth
   help another with mutual consent, and one doth gently allow [741] that
   which another hath begun.

   Acts 11:25-26

   25. And Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek Saul: 26. And when he had found
   him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened that they lived a whole
   year in the church, and did teach a great multitude; so that at Antioch
   the disciples were first called Christians.


   25. Barnabas' simplicity is commended to us now the second time, that
   whereas he might have borne the chiefest swing at Antioch, yet went he
   into Cilicia that he might fet [fetch] Paul thence, who he knew should
   be preferred before him. Therefore we see how, forgetting himself, he
   respecteth nothing but that Christ may be chief; how he setteth before
   his eyes the edifying of the Church alone; how he is content with the
   prosperous success of the gospel. Therefore, Barnabas is no whit afraid
   lest Paul do any whit debase him by his coming, so he glorify Christ.

   26. He addeth afterward, that such a holy concord was blessed from
   heaven; for this was no small honor that the holy name of Christians
   began there for all the whole world. Though the apostles had been long
   time at Jerusalem, yet God had not vouchsafed to bestow upon his
   Church, which was there, this excellent title of his Son. Whether it
   were because at Antioch much people was grown together into one body,
   as well of Jews as of Gentiles, or whether it were because the Church
   might be better ordered in time of peace; or because they were more
   bold to confess their faith, there were in very deed Christians both at
   Jerusalem and also in Samaria before that time; and we know that
   Jerusalem was the first fountain from which Christianity did flow.
   [742] And what is it else to be a disciple of Christ but to be a
   Christian? But when they began plainly to be called that which they
   were the use of the name served greatly to set forth the glory of
   Christ, because by this means they referred all their religion unto
   Christ alone. This was, therefore, a most excellent worship for the
   city of Antioch. that Christ brought forth his name thence like a
   standard, whereby it might be made known to all the world that there
   was some people whose captain was Christ, and which did glory in his
   name.

   But and if Rome had such a color of [pretext for] pride, who were able
   to suffer the proud boastings of the Pope and his adherents? They would
   then, not without cause, thunder out that Rome is the mother and head
   of all Churches; but it is well, that seeing they challenge to
   themselves whatsoever, when they come to the matter, they are found
   altogether vain; yea, Antioch itself doth plainly prove that the estate
   of one place is not continual. Admit we grant the Romans these
   plausible titles, we have been sometimes, [we once were,] shall they
   yet be so bold as to take one-half of that which belongeth to Antioch?
   And is the dignity of Antioch the greater now, because the Christians
   had their name thence? Yea, it is rather a manifest mirror of the
   horrible vengeance of God. For, seeing there is nothing to be seen
   there but evil favored wastiness, [743] it remaineth that we learn to
   humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, and that we know that
   unthankful men have not so much liberty granted them that they may
   freely mock God.

   Acts 11:27-30

   27. In those days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28. And one
   of them, named Agabus, arose, and signified by the Spirit, that there
   should be a great famine throughout the whole world, which happened
   under Claudius Caesar. 29. And as every one of the disciples was able,
   they decreed every man to send succor to the brethren which dwelt in
   Judea. 30. Which thing they did, sending it unto the elders by the
   hands of Barnabas and Saul.


   27. Luke commendeth in this place the faith of the men of Antioch by
   the fruit, because they endeavored to relieve the poverty of that
   church, from whence they received the gospel, with their abundance; and
   that did they unrequested. Such earnest care for the brethren doth
   sufficiently declare how seriously they worshipped Christ, the head of
   all. Luke doth signify that the fame of that church was spread abroad,
   when he saith that there came excellent men thither from Jerusalem. But
   forasmuch as the word prophet is taken divers ways in the New Testament
   as we may learn by the former Epistle to the Corinthians, those are
   called prophets in this place who were endued with the gift of
   prophesying, as the four daughters of Philip shall have the same title
   given them hereafter. And forasmuch as the foretelling of the famine is
   attributed to Agabus alone, we may hereby gather that this was granted
   to every one by a certain measure to know things to come.

   28. He signified by the Spirit. Luke doth plainly express that the
   Spirit of God was the author of this prophecy, that we may know that it
   was not a conjecture taken by the stars, or some other natural causes;
   again, that Agabus did not play the philosopher after the manner of
   men, but he uttered that which God had appointed by the secret
   inspiration of the Spirit. Barrenness may indeed be sometimes foretold
   by the disposition of the stars, but there is no certainty in such
   foretellings, both because of the opposite concourses, and also,
   especially, because God doth govern earthly things at his pleasure, far
   otherwise than can be gathered by the stars, that he may lead men away
   from the perverse beholding of stars. And although these foretellings
   have their degree, yet the prophecies of the Spirit do far exceed them.
   But it seemeth that the foretelling of the famine was unlucky, [of evil
   omen,] and not to be wished for; for to what end was it for men to be
   made miserable before their time, by having the unhappy event foretold?
   I answer, that there be many causes for which it is expedient that men
   should be warned before in time when the judgments of God hang over
   their heads, and punishments [are] due to their sins. I omit others
   which are usual [744] in the prophets, because [viz. that] they have a
   space granted wherein to repent, that they may prevent God's judgment,
   who have provoked his wrath against themselves; because [that] the
   faithful are instructed in time to arm themselves with patience;
   because [that] the obstinate wickedness of wicked men is convict;
   because [that] both good and evil learn that miseries do not come by
   chance, but that they are punishments wherewith God doth punish the
   sins of the world; because [that] those are awakened out of their sleep
   and sluggishness by this means, who took great delight in their vices.
   The profit of this present prophecy appeareth by the text, because the
   men of Antioch were thereby pricked forward to relieve their brethren
   which were in misery.

   Which happened under Claudius. Suetonius also maketh mention of this
   famine, who saith that there were crusts or shards thrown at Claudius'
   head in the midst of the market and that he was so sore afraid of
   stoning, that he had a singular care afterward, during his whole life,
   to make provision for victual. And Josephus, in his Fifteenth Book of
   Antiquity, saith, that Judea was sore oppressed with scarcity, by
   reason of continual drought.

   29. But here ariseth a question, seeing that the misery was common to
   all, why ought they rather to have succored one people than all the
   rest? I answer, that forasmuch as Judea was impoverished with great
   destructions of wars and other miseries, the men of Antioch were not
   without cause more moved with the miseries of the brethren which were
   there; secondly, the greater the rage of the enemies was, the more
   wretched was the estate of the brethren. Finally, Paul doth
   sufficiently declare, in the Epistle to the Galatians, that Judea had
   certain especial necessities, whereof all other had regard, not without
   cause, (Galatians 3) And this thankfulness deserved no small
   commendations, in that the men of Antioch thought that they ought to
   help the needy brethren, from whom they had received the gospel. For
   there is nothing more just than that those should reap earthly things
   who have sown spiritual things. As every man is too much bent to
   provide for himself, every man might readily have excepted and
   objected: Why shall not I rather provide for myself? But when they call
   to mind how greatly they are indebted to the brethren, omitting that
   carefulness, [745] they turn themselves to help them. In sum, this alms
   had a double end; for the men of Antioch did the duty of charity toward
   their needy brethren and they did also testify by this sign, what great
   account they made of the gospel, whilst that they honored the place
   whence it came.

   As every man was able. We see the men of Antioch observe in this place
   that mean which Paul prescribeth to the Corinthians, (2 Corinthians
   8:6,) whether they did this of themselves, or being instructed by him;
   and it is not to be doubted, but that he continued like to himself
   [746] in both places. Therefore we must follow this rule, that every
   one, considering how much is granted him, impart the same courteously
   with his brethren, as one that must give an account; so shall it come
   to pass, that he which is but poor shall have a liberal mind, and that
   a small reward [747] shall be counted a fat and gorgeous sacrifice. By
   this word determined, Luke giveth us to understand that their oblation
   was voluntary. Which thing ought so to be, as Paul teacheth, that we
   reach out our hand unto the needy not as constrained, but cheerfully,
   (2 Corinthians 9:7.) When as he nameth every one, it is all one as if
   he should say, that one did not prescribe another a law, neither did
   they burthen one another with their prejudice, but that every man did
   bestow his liberality as seemed good to himself; and we must note the
   word diakonias, whereby we are taught that rich men have greater
   abundance given them upon that condition, that they may be the
   ministers of the poor in the dispensation committed to them by God.
   Lastly, Luke teacheth that the blessing was sent not to all the whole
   nation, but only to those that were of the household of faith, not
   because we ought never to use any bountifulness, or courtesy towards
   the unbelievers, seeing love ought to extend itself unto all mankind,
   but because those ought to be preferred whom God hath joined and linked
   to us move near, and with a more holy band.

   30. Sending it unto the elders, [presbyters.] We must note two things
   in this place, that the men of Antioch did choose faithful men, and of
   known honesty, to carry their blessing; secondly, that they sent it
   unto the elders, that they might wisely bestow the same. For if alms be
   thrown into the midst of the common people, or be set in the midst
   where every one may take what he will, every man will by and by take it
   to himself as if it were some common prey; and so he that is most bold
   will defraud the needy; yea, through his greediness he will cut the
   throats of the hungry. Therefore, let us mark these places, which teach
   that we must not only deal uprightly and faithfully, but that there is
   also an order and wisdom required as well in making choice as in all
   our administration. Those are called elders in whose hands the
   government of the Church was, among whom the apostles were chief; the
   men of Antioch refer the holy money (which they had appointed for the
   poor) to their discretion. If any man object that this was the office
   of the deacons, forasmuch as the apostles did deny that they could both
   serve tables and attend upon doctrine, answer is easy, that the deacons
   were appointed over tables, in such sort, that yet, notwithstanding,
   they were under the elders, [presbyters,] neither did they any thing
   but at their appointment.

   CHAPTER 12
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 12:1-5

   1. About that time Herod the king stretched out his hand to afflict
   certain of the Church. 2. And he killed James the brother of John with
   the sword. 3. And when he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded
   to take Peter also. (Then were the days of sweet [unleavened] bread.)
   4. When he had taken him also, he put him in prison, delivering him to
   four quaternions of soldiers to be kept; intending after Easter to
   bring him forth to the people. 5. Therefore, Peter was kept in prison;
   but continual prayer was made for him of the Church of [to] God.


   1. Here followeth new persecution raised by Herod. We see that the
   Church had some short truce, that it might, as it were, by a short
   breathing, recover some courage against the time to come, and that it
   might then fight afresh. So at this day there is no cause why the
   faithful, having borne the brunts of one or two conflicts, should
   promise themselves rest, [748] or should desire such a calling [749] as
   old overworn soldiers use to have. Let this suffice them if the Lord
   grant them some time wherein they may recover their strength. This
   Herod was Agrippa the greater, [elder,] the son of Aristobulus, whom
   his father slew. Josephus doth no where call him Herod, it may be,
   because he had a brother who was king of Chalcis, whose name was Herod.
   This man was incensed to afflict the Church not so much for any love he
   had to religion, as that by this means he might flatter the common
   people which did otherwise not greatly favor him; or rather, he was
   moved hereunto with tyrannical cruelty, because he was afraid of
   innovation, which tyrants do always fear, lest it trouble the quiet
   estate of their dominion. Yet it is likely that he did shed innocent
   blood, that, according to the common craft of kings, he might gratify a
   furious people; because St. Luke will shortly after declare that Peter
   the apostle was put into prison that he might be a pleasant spectacle.

   He killed James. Undoubtedly the cruelty of this mad man was restrained
   and bridled by the secret power of God. For assuredly he would never
   have been content with one or two murders, and so have abstained from
   persecuting the rest, but he would rather have piled up martyrs upon
   heaps, unless God had set his hand against him, and defended his flock.
   So when we see that the enemies of godliness, being full of fury, do
   not commit horrible slaughters, that they may mix and imbrue all things
   with blood, let us know that we need not thank their moderation and
   clemency for this; but because, when the Lord doth spare his sheep, he
   doth not suffer them to do so much hurt as they would. This Herod was
   not so courteous, that he would stick to win peace or the people's
   favor with the punishment of an hundred men or more.

   Wherefore, we must think with ourselves that he was tied by one that
   had the rule over him, that he might not more vehemently oppress the
   Church. He slew James, as, when any sedition is raised, the heads and
   captains go first to the pot, [750] that the common riff-raft may by
   their punishment be terrified. Nevertheless, the Lord suffered him whom
   he had furnished with constancy to be put to death, that by death he
   might get the victory as a strong and invincible champion. So that the
   attempts of tyrants notwithstanding, God maketh choice of
   sweet-smelling sacrifices to establish the faith of his gospel. Luke
   calleth this games which was slain the brother of John, that he may
   distinguish him from the son of Alpheus. For whereas some make him a
   third cousin of Christ's, who was only some one of the disciples, I do
   not like of that, because I am by strong reasons persuaded to think
   that there were no more. Let him that will, repair to the second to the
   Galatians. Therefore, I think that the apostle and the son of Alpheus
   were all one, whom the Jews threw down headlong from the top of the
   temple, whose death was so highly Commended for his singular praise of
   holiness.

   3. Seeing that it pleased the Jews. It appeareth more plainly by this
   that Herod was not moved either with any zeal that he had to Moses' law
   or with any hatred of the gospel, thus to persecute the Church; but
   that he might provide for his own private affairs, for he proceedeth in
   his cruelty that he may win the people's favor; therefore we must know
   that there be diverse causes for which the Church is assaulted on every
   side. Oftentimes perverse zeal driveth the wicked headlong to fight for
   their superstitions, and that they may sacrifice an offering to their
   idols by shedding innocent blood; but the more part is moved with
   private commodities only, so in times past, at such time as Nero knew,
   after the burning of the city, that he was loathed and hated of the
   people, he sought by this subtle means to get into favor again, or, at
   least, he went about to stay their slanders and complaints, by putting
   certain thousands of the godly to death.

   In like sort, that Herod may win the people's favor, who did love him
   but a little, he putteth the Christians to death. as a price wherewith
   he might redeem their favor; and such is our estate at this day, for
   though all men run by troops upon the members of Christ, [751] yet few
   are pooked [752] forward with superstition; but some sell themselves to
   antichrist, like profitable bond-slaves; other some bear with, and
   commend the outrageous outcries of monks and the common people. But we,
   in the mean season, being abjects, must be glad to bear their mocks;
   yet there is one comfort which doth excellently keep us on foot, in
   that we know that our blood is precious in the sight of Almighty God,
   which the world cloth shamefully abuse; yea, the more shamefully and
   reproachfully the wicked do handle us, so much the less shall God's
   goodness forsake us.

   4. Adding four quaternions of soldiers. Luke doth, in this place,
   declare by circumstances that Peter was, as it were, shut up in his
   grave, so that it might seem that he was quite past hope; for as they
   divided the day and night into four parts by three hours, so Herod
   divided the watches, that four soldiers might always keep watch, and
   that one quaternion might succeed another every third hour. He showeth
   the cause why he was not forthwith put to death, because it had been an
   heinous offense to put him to death in the Easter holidays; therefore,
   Herod doth not delay the time as doubtful what to do, but doth only
   wait for opportunity; yea, he maketh choice of a time, when as his gift
   may be more plausible, because there came a great multitude together
   from all parts unto the holy day. [753]

   5. But prayers were made. Luke teacheth here that the faithful did not,
   in the mean season, foreslow [neglect] their duty, Peter stood in the
   forward [754] alone; but all the rest fought with their prayers
   together with him, and they aided him so much as they were able. Hereby
   we do also gather, that they were not discouraged, for by prayer they
   testify that they persist so much as they are able in defense of the
   cause, for which Peter is in danger of life. This place teacheth,
   first, how we ought to be affected when we see our brethren persecuted
   by the wicked for the testimony of the gospel, for if we be slothful,
   and if we be not inwardly touched with their dangers, we do not only
   defy and them of the due duty of love, but also treacherously forsake
   the confession of our faith; and, assuredly, if the cause be common,
   yea, if they fight for our safety and salvation, we do not only forsake
   them, but even Christ and ourselves; and the present necessity
   requireth, that they be far more fervent in prayer than commonly they
   are, whosoever will be counted Christians. We see some of our brethren
   (being brought to extreme poverty) live in exile, others we see
   imprisoned, many cast into stinking dungeons, many consumed with fire,
   yea, we see new torments oftentimes invented, whereby being long
   tormented they may feel death. Unless these provocations sharpen our
   desire to pray, we be more than blockish; therefore, so soon as any
   persecution ariseth, let us by and by get ourselves to prayer.

   Also, it is a likely thing that the Church took greater thought for
   Peter's life, because they should have suffered great loss if he had
   gone. [755] Neither doth Luke say barely that prayer was made; but he
   addeth also, that it was earnest and continual, whereby he giveth us to
   understand that the faithful prayed not coldly or over fields; [756]
   but so long as Peter was in the conflict, the faithful did what they
   could to help him, and that without wearisomeness. We must always
   understand the name of God, which is here expressed, whensoever mention
   is made of prayer in the Scripture, for this is one of the chiefest and
   first principles of faith, that we ought to direct our prayers unto God
   alone, as he challengeth to himself this peculiar worship, "Call upon
   me in the day of tribulation," (Psalm 50:15.)

   Acts 12:6-11

   6. And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night slept
   Peter between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the keepers kept
   the prison before the door. 7. And, behold, the angel of the Lord
   stood, and a light shined in the habitation: and he smote Peter's side,
   saying, Arise straightway; and his chains felt from his hands, 8. And
   the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he
   did so. Then he saith to him, Put thy garment about thee, and follow
   me. 9. And going out, he followed him, neither understood he that that
   was true which was done by the angel; but he thought that he saw a
   vision. 10. And when they were past the first watch, and the second,
   they came to the iron gate, which leadeth into the city, which opened
   to them of its own accord; and when they were come out, they passed
   through one street, and by and by the angel departed from him. 11. Then
   Peter returning to himself, said, Now of a truth I know that the Lord
   hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod,
   and from all the waiting of the people of the Jews.


   6. When he was about to bring him forth. It seemeth at the first blush
   that the Church prayeth to small purpose, for the day was now appointed
   wherein Peter should be put to death, and he is within one night of
   death, and yet the faithful cease not to pray, because they know that
   when the Lord doth purpose to deliver his, he taketh his time
   oftentimes in the last and farthest point of necessity, and that he
   hath in his hand diverse ways to deliver. Secondly, we may think that
   they did not so much pray for Peter's life, as that the Lord would arm
   him with invincible fortitude, for the glory of the gospel, and that
   God would [not] set the gospel of his Son open to the reproaches and
   slanders of the wicked.

   That night he slept. All these circumstances do more set forth the
   wonderful power of God, for who would not have thought that Peter was
   already swallowed up of death? for though he drew breath as yet, yet he
   had no chinch [chink] to creep out at, for as much as he was beset with
   many deaths. Therefore, whereas he escapeth from amidst deaths, whereas
   he goeth safely among the hands of his hangmen, whereas the chains are
   molten and are loosed, whereas the iron gate openeth itself to him;
   hereby it appeareth that it was a mere divine kind of deliverance, and
   it was profitable for Peter to be thus taught by these signs, that he
   might with more assurance forthwith declare unto men the grace of God
   thus known. Again, it appeareth by this strait keeping that Herod meant
   nothing less [757] than to let Peter go away alive.

   7. A light shined, It is to be thought that Peter alone saw this light,
   and that the soldiers did either sleep so soundly, or else were so
   amazed, that they neither felt nor perceived any thing, And there might
   be two causes why God would have the light to shine; either that Peter
   might have the use thereof, and that the darkness might be no hindrance
   to him, or that it might be to him a sign and token of the heavenly
   glory. For we read oftentimes that the angels appeared with glistering
   brightness, even when the sun did shine, Assuredly, Peter might have
   gathered by the strange light that God was present, and also he ought
   to have made his profit thereof. When as the angel smiteth Peter's
   side, it appeareth hereby what a care God hath for his, who watcheth
   over them when they sleep, and raiseth them when they are drowsy. And
   surely there were nothing more miserable than we, if the continuance of
   our prayers alone did keep God in his watching over us; for such is the
   infirmity of our flesh that we faint and quail, and we stand most of
   all in need of his help when our minds, being drawn away, do not seek
   him. Sleep is a certain image of death, and doth choke and drown all
   the senses, what should become of us if God should then cease to have
   respect to us? But forasmuch as when the faithful go to sleep, they
   commit their safety to God, it cometh to pass by this means, that even
   their sleep doth call upon God.

   Whereas he saith, that immediately after the angel had said the word
   the chains were loosed, we gather by this, that there is power enough
   in the commandment of God alone to remove all manner [of] lets, when
   all ways seem to be stopt on all sides, so that if he intend to appease
   the motions and tumults of war, although the whole world were appointed
   in armor, their spears and swords shall forthwith fall out of their
   hands; on the other side, if he be determined to punish us and our sins
   with war, in a moment, (in the twinkling of an eye,) their minds, which
   were before given to peace, shall wax hot, and they shall lay hand on
   their swords. Whereas Luke setteth down severally both the words of the
   angel, and also the course of the matter, it serveth for the more
   certainty of the history, that it may in every respect appear that
   Peter was delivered by God.

   9. He knew not that it was true. He did not think that it was a vain or
   false visor, as Satan doth oftentimes delude men with jugglings; but
   true is taken in this place for that which is done naturally and after
   the manner of men. For we must note the contrariety [antithesis] that
   is between the thing itself and the vision. Furthermore, though he
   think that it is a vision, yet doth he willingly obey; whereby his
   obedience is proved, whilst that being content with the commandment of
   the angel alone, he doth not inquire nor reason what he must de, but
   doth that which he is commanded to do.

   10. When they were past. God was able to have carried Peter away in the
   turning of an hand; [758] but he overcometh diverse straits one after
   another, that the glory of the miracle might be the greater. So he
   created the world in six days, (Genesis 1.) not because he had any need
   of space of thee, but that he might the better stay us in the
   meditating upon his works, (Exodus 20:11,) for he applieth the manner
   of doing unto our capacity, and unto the increase of faith. If Peter
   had at a sudden been carried unto the house where the brethren were
   assembled, then should one only deliverance have been acknowledged, but
   now we see, as it were with our eyes, that he was delivered more than
   ten times.

   11. Then Peter returning to himself. It is word for word, being made in
   himself, because, being before astonied with a strange and incredible
   thing, he was, as it were, without himself. But now at length, as it
   were after a trance, he knoweth that he is delivered from death. His
   words set down by Luke contain a thanksgiving; for he extolleth with
   himself the benefit of God which he had tried, [experienced,] and
   whereof he had tasted, and he doth highly commend it with himself,
   until he find some other witnesses. He saith that the angel was sent of
   God, according to the common meaning of the godly, who hold that the
   angels are appointed to be ministers, to be careful for, and to take
   charge of their safety; for unless he had been thus persuaded, he would
   not have spoken of the angel. And yet he doth not commend the angel as
   the author of the grace, but he ascribeth all the whole praise of the
   work to God alone, neither do the angels help us to this end, that they
   may derive unto themselves even the least jot of God's glory. Whereas
   he saith that he was delivered out of the hand of Herod, he amplifieth
   the goodness and benefit of God, by the power of his enemy. To the same
   end tendeth that which he addeth of the Jews; for the greater the
   number of the enemies was, the more excellent was the grace of God
   toward his servant; for it is a great matter that God alone being
   favorable, the deadly hatred of all the whole world should come to
   nought.

   Acts 12:12-19

   12. And, considering, he came into the house of Mary the mother of
   John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered and praying. 13.
   And when Peter had knocked at the entry-door, a maid came out to
   hearken, named Rhoda. 14. And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened
   not the door for joy, but running in, she told that Peter stood
   without. 15. But they said to her, Thou art mad. But she affirmed more
   vehemently that it was so. But they said, It is his angel. 16. But.
   Peter continued knocking: when they had opened, they saw him, and they
   were astonished. 17. But after that he had beckoned to them with the
   hand, that they should hold their peace, he told them how God had
   brought him out of prison. And he said, Tell James and the brethren
   these things. And he departed thence, and went into another place. 18.
   After that it was day, there was no small ado amongst the soldiers,
   what was become of Peter. 19. And when Herod had sought him, and could
   not find him, so soon as he knew the matter, he commanded the keepers
   to be carried away, [executed.]


   12. Into the house of Mary It appeareth that she was a matron of rare
   godliness, whose house was, as it were, a certain temple of God, where
   the brethren did use to meet together. And Luke saith that there were
   many assembled there, because, seeing they could not all meet together
   in one place without fear of some tumult, they came together in diverse
   places of the city in companies, as they could conveniently. For,
   doubtless, there were other companies gathered together elsewhere,
   because it is not to be thought that (at such times as many of the
   faithful did give themselves to prayer) the apostles were not in like
   sort occupied, and one house could not hold so many. And we must always
   mark the circumstance of time, because, even in the heat of the enemy's
   cruelty, the godly were, notwithstanding, assembled together. For if,
   at any time, this exercise be profitable, then is it most necessary
   when hard conflicts approach.

   15. When he did knock at the gate. Whereas they think that the maid is
   mad, which telleth them that Peter was come; we gather by this, that
   they did not hope or look for Peter's deliverance, and yet we will not
   say that they prayed without faith; because they looked for some other
   success, to with that Peter being armed with power from heaven, should
   be ready, whether it were by life or death, to glorify God, [759] that
   the flock being terrified with the violent invasion of wolves might not
   be scattered abroad, that those that were weak might not faint, that
   the Lord would put away that whirlwind of persecution. But in that the
   Lord granteth them more than they hoped for, he surpasseth their
   desires with his infinite goodness. And now that which was done seemeth
   to them incredible, that they may be the more provoked to praise his
   power.

   It is his angel. They call him his angel, who was by God appointed to
   be his keeper and the minister of his safety. In which sense Christ
   saith that the angels of little ones do always see the face of his
   Father, (Matthew 18:10.) And what do they gather hence commonly? that
   every particular man hath a particular angel, which taketh charge of
   him; but it is too weak. For the Scripture doth sometimes testify
   (Exodus 14:10) that there is one angel given to a great people, and to
   one man only a great host. For Elizeus [Elisha] his servant had his
   eyes opened, so that he saw in the air chariots of fire, which were
   appointed to defend the prophet, (2 Kings 6:17.) And in Daniel there is
   but one angel of the Persians, and one of the Grecians named, (Daniel
   10:5, 12.) Neither doth the Scripture promise to every man a certain
   and peculiar angel, but rather that the Lord hath charged his angels to
   keep all the faithful, (Psalm 91:11;) also that they pitch their tents
   about the godly, (Psalm 34:8.) Therefore, that vain surmise which is
   common touching the two angels of every man is profane. Let this be
   sufficient for us, that the whole host of heaven doth watch for the
   safety of the Church; and that as necessity of time requireth sometimes
   one angel, sometimes more do defend us with their aid. Assuredly, this
   is inestimable goodness of God, in that he saith that the angels, who
   are the beams of his brightness, are our ministers.

   17. Tell James and the brethren: By brethren I understand not every one
   that was of the Church but the apostles and elders. For though it were
   requisite that the miracle should be made known to all, yet will Peter
   worthily for honor's sake, have his fellows in office to be certified
   thereof. Ecclesiastical writers after Eusebius report that this James
   was one of the disciples; but forasmuch as Paul reckoneth him in the
   number of the three pillars of the Church, (Galatians 2:9,) I do not
   think that a disciple was advanced to that dignity, and the apostles
   set aside. Wherefore, I do rather conjecture, that this was James the
   son of Alpheus, whose holiness was such, that it caused the Jews to
   wonder at it. And there be two reasons for which Peter would have this
   joyful message brought unto the brethren; to wit, that he might rid
   them of that care which did vex them; secondly, that they might be
   encouraged with such an example of God's goodness to be the more bold.
   Whereas he passeth into another place, I think it was done for this
   cause, because, forasmuch as the house was well known and famous,
   because many of the brethren resorted thither, he might lie hid
   elsewhere with less danger. Therefore, he sought a place which was not
   so much suspected of the enemy, and that he might not only save
   himself, but also his hostess and others.

   18. When it was day. Luke returneth now unto Herod and the soldiers;
   and he saith that there was no small ado amongst them. For they could
   not suspect that Peter was taken from them by violence, or that he was
   escaped by some subtle shift. Herod examineth the matter afterward as a
   judge; but when as he perceived that the soldiers were in no fault, he
   himself is also enforced to be a witness of the deliverance wrought by
   God. Whereas he commandeth them to be carried out of his sight, or to
   be carried to prison, we may thereby gather, that their faithfulness
   and diligence were approved and seen; for if there had been any
   suspicion of negligence, there was punishment prepared for them; but
   the cause why he doth not let them go free was partly rage, mixed with
   tyrannous cruelty, and partly shamefacedness. Though some expound it
   otherwise, that he commanded that they should be punished forthwith.
   [760] And whether, being angry, he delivered them to the hangman, or he
   was content to punish them with perpetual imprisonment, it is assuredly
   an excellent example of blindness, that whereas he ought to perceive
   the power of God, yea, though his eyes were shut, yet doth he not bend,
   neither doth he wax more meek, but proceedeth to resist God of
   obstinate malice. Thus doth Satan deprive the wicked of understanding,
   that in seeing they see not; and the Lord, by smiting them with this
   horrible amazedness, doth justly revenge himself and his Church.

   Acts 12:19-25

   And descending from Judea to Cesarea, he stayed there. 20. And Herod
   was offended with those of Tyre and Sidon: but they came unto him with
   one consent, and persuading Blastus, the chamberlain to the king, they
   required peace, because their country was nourished by the king's
   country. 21. And upon a day appointed Herod arrayed himself in royal
   apparel, and sitting upon his throne, he made an oration unto them. 22.
   And the people cried, It is the voice of God, and not of man. 23. And
   straightway the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not the
   glory to God: and being eaten of worms, he died. 24. Furthermore, the
   word of God did increase and multiply. 25. And Barnabas and Paul
   returned from Jerusalem to Antioch, having finished their office,
   taking John with them, which was called Mark.


   20. A worthy [761] history, which doth not only show, as it were in a
   glass, what end is prepared for the enemies of the Church, but also how
   greatly God hateth pride. The Scripture saith that "God resisteth the
   proud," (1 Peter 5:5.) God himself did show a lively image thereof in
   the person of Herod. And assuredly men cannot extol themselves higher
   than becometh them, but they shall make war with God, who, to the end
   he may surpass all, [762] commandeth all flesh to keep silence. And if
   God did so sharply punish pride in a king whom prosperity did puff up,
   what shall become of those of the common sort who are ridiculously
   puffed up without cause? Furthermore, we must note the course of the
   history, that all things go well with Herod after that he had miserably
   vexed the Church; he enforced the nations round about him, being tamed
   with hunger, to come to crave pardon upon their knees, as if God had
   rewarded him well for his wicked fury. This was no small trial for the
   godly, who might have thought thus with themselves [763] that God cared
   not for them, and they were afraid lest with Herod's power his tyranny
   and cruelty should increase. But the Lord had another purpose, [764]
   for he set the oppressor of his Church on high that he might have the
   greater fall. Therefore, that shadowish felicity, wherein he delighted
   too much, was unto him a certain falling against the day of slaughter.
   In like sort, when at this day we see the bloody enemies of the Church
   carried up upon the wings of fortune into heaven, there is no cause why
   we should be discouraged; but let us rather call to mind that saying of
   Solomon,

   "Pride goeth before calamity;
   and the heart is lifted up before a fall,"
   (Proverbs 16:18.)

   Herod was displeased. Luke useth the compound participle, thumomachon
   which signifieth privy grudging or hatred. Therefore Herod did not make
   open war against those cities; but such was his displeasure, that he
   essayed to subdue them by policy, as it were by undermining them by
   little and little. It is a rare matter, saith Demosthenes, for free
   cities to agree with monarchs. Moreover, Herod was naturally cruel,
   bold, of insatiable covetousness; and it is not to be doubted but that
   Tyre and Sidon were, as it were, certain bars or rails to stay his
   fury, as they were wealthy cities, and unaccustomed to bear the yoke.
   Also, the remembrance of their old glory might have encouraged them;
   forasmuch as pride cometh commonly of wealth, it is no marvel if these
   two cities were proud, the one whereof Isaiah calleth queen of the
   seas, whose merchants, he said, were kings, and her chapmen dukes,
   (Isaiah 23:8.) Also, he saith elsewhere that Sidon was become proud by
   reason of her wealth. And although they had sundry times been brought
   almost to utter ruin, yet the commodiousness of their situation did
   shortly restore them to their wonted state. Hereby it came to pass that
   they could more hardly digest Agrippa, of late a base fellow, a man of
   no estimation, [765] and one who had been let out of prison; especially
   seeing that he had behaved himself so cruelly toward his own subjects,
   and was troublesome and injurious to his neighbors.

   Forasmuch as their country was nourished. It had not been good for him
   to have assailed the men of Tyre and Sidon with open war, therefore he
   giveth commandment that there should no corn nor victual be carried
   [766] out of his realm. By this means did he, without any army, besiege
   them by little and little. For the borders of both cities were strait,
   and their ground barren, whereas there was a great people to be fed.
   Therefore, after that they were tamed with hunger, they humbly crave
   peace, and that not free, for assuredly they had some laws given them;
   and it is to be thought that this Blastus mentioned by Luke was not
   with bare words persuaded, but with rewards [gifts] won to entreat the
   peace. [767] I know not why Erasmus did think it good to translate this
   place otherwise than the words import.

   21. Upon an appointed day. Luke saith that the men of Tyrus and Sidon
   had peace granted them, because this was the occasion of the king's
   oration, without doubt, that he might make them his underlings
   hereafter. The same history is extant in Josephus, in his Nineteenth
   Book of Antiquities, save only that he calleth him everywhere Agrippa,
   whom Luke calleth Herod. It is to be thought that Agrippa was his
   proper name, and that he was called by none other name so long as he
   was a private man; but after that he was advanced to be a king, he took
   to himself princely dignity, according to the name of his grandfather.
   Josephus and Luke agree together wonderfully in the thing itself, and
   in all circumstances. First, they agree concerning the place. Josephus
   saith, That his garment was embroidered with gold, on which, when the
   sun-beams light, it did glister again; and that this was the cause
   which moved the courtiers to call him [768] a god. That he was suddenly
   wounded; also, that there was seen an owl sitting upon a cord over his
   head, which cord did prognosticate his ruin. And he is so far from
   doubting that his sacrilegious pride was punished with this kind of
   punishment, that he saith, that he confessed the same openly amidst his
   cruel torments, "Behold me, whom you call a god; I am enforced to
   finish my life most miserable." There is no mention made there of the
   peace made with those of Tyrus and Sidon; but that he made and set
   forth plays [769] in honor of Caesar. But it may be that the solemnity
   of the plays was appointed in respect of the peace concluded, which we
   know was a solemn thing.

   23. Forthwith he smote him. As, before, the angel was a minister of
   God's grace in the delivery of Peter, so now he taketh vengeance upon
   Herod. And God doth sometimes use the ministry of angels in heaven in
   punishing; but sometimes he maketh the devils as hangmen, by whose hand
   he executeth his judgments. And this doth he as well toward his
   faithful servants as toward the reprobate. Saul was troubled and vexed
   by Satan, (1 Samuel 16:14) but the same did also befall holy Job, (Job
   1:12; 2:7.) In the Psalms, the punishments wherewith God doth chasten
   the wicked are attributed to the evil angels; yet we see how the angel
   which had the government of the safety of the Church smiteth the
   Egyptians in the first-begotten, (Exodus 12:29;) although the Scripture
   calleth the wicked spirits God's spirits, because they are obedient to
   his commandment, though full sore against their will. But where the
   epithet evil is not added, as in this place, we must understand the
   angel which doth willingly obey God, and yet the shape of the owl,
   whereof Josephus maketh mention, did rather serve to figure the devil
   than an heavenly angel.

   Furthermore, I dare not affirm for a surety what manner of disease that
   was. The word which Luke useth doth signify that he was eaten up of
   worms. Many conjecture that it was a lousy disease. This is certain,
   that even when he was yet alive he was corrupt with stink and
   rottenness, so that he was, as it were, a living carcass. So that he
   was not only vexed with cruel torments, but also made a laughing-stock
   to all men, and of all men reviled. For God intended to make choice of
   a kind of punishment wherewith he might repress the cruelty of a proud
   man with extreme ignominy. If he had been overcome of some great and
   valiant army, and had been brought to poverty, the judgment of God had
   not been so marked; and this had been an honest and princely
   chastisement; [770] but forasmuch as he abhorreth lice and worms, and
   this filthiness cometh out of his body, which doth kill him by eating
   him up, he is handled according to his deserts.

   In like sort Pharaoh, forasmuch as he did so oft exalt himself against
   God with untamed pride, he was not orderly assailed by some prince that
   did border upon him, but locusts and caterpillars were God's warriors
   [soldiers] to make war against him, (Exodus 8:17, 24;) for the more
   proudly a man exalteth himself, the more doth he deserve to be cast
   doom of God into the lowest hell with shame and reproach. This is the
   reason why he set this reigned god Herod to be eaten up of worms, which
   he was at length enforced to grant, when he said, "Behold me, whom ye
   saluted as a god; I die miserable." Such a manifest example of horrible
   vengeance in a king's person ought to terrify us not a little from
   presuming to take to ourselves more than we ought; and that we do not
   suffer ourselves to be made drunk with the false commendation and
   flattery of men as with deadly poison.

   Because he gave not the glory to God. He is condemned of sacrilege, not
   only because he suffered himself to be called God, but because,
   forgetting himself, he took to himself the honor due to God. We do not
   read that the king of Babylon was thus extolled; and yet the prophet
   upbraideth to him that he went about to make himself equal with God,
   (Isaiah 14:13, 14.) Therefore this sacrilege is a common fault in all
   proud men, because, by taking to themselves more than they ought, they
   darken the glory of God; and so, like giants, so much as ever they are
   able, they endeavor to pluck God out of his seat. Howsoever, they do
   not usurp the title of God, neither openly boast with their mouth that
   they are gods; yet because they take to themselves that which is proper
   to God, they desire to be, and to be accounted gods, having brought him
   under, furthermore, the prophet pointeth out the beginning of this evil
   in one word, when he bringeth in Nebuchadnezzar speaking on this wise,
   "I will go up," (Isaiah 14:13.)

   Wherefore there is but one remedy, if every one keep himself in that
   degree wherein he is placed. Let those who are base and castaways [in a
   humble station] not desire to climb higher; let kings, and those who
   are above others, remember that they are mortal, and let them modestly
   submit their highness to God. And we must note, that it is not enough
   if men give to God only half the honor which is due to him, who
   challengeth all that wholly which is his own; if they submit themselves
   but in part, whom he will have to be thoroughly humbled. Now, forasmuch
   as the Scripture despoileth us quite of all praise of wisdom, virtue,
   and righteousness, there is no one of us that can take to himself the
   least jot of glory without sacrilegious robbing of God. And it is a
   wonder that, seeing the Scripture pronounceth that all those make, as
   it were, open war against God which exalt themselves; and we do all
   grant that that cannot be done without our overthrow, [destruction;]
   the greatest part of men runneth, notwithstanding, headlong with
   furious boldness unto their own destruction; for there is scarce one of
   an hundred who, being mindful of his condition, doth leave to God his
   glory undiminished.

   24. And the word of God. When the tyrant was once taken out of the way
   the Church was suddenly delivered, as it were, out of the jaws of the
   wolf. Therefore, though the faithful be accounted as sheep appointed to
   be slain, (Psalm 44:23,) yet the Church doth always overlive her
   enemies; and though the word of God seem oftentimes to be oppressed
   with the wicked tyranny of men, yet it getteth up the head again by and
   by, (Romans 8:37.) For Luke determined [771] not only what had happened
   after that Herod was dead, but also by this example to encourage us,
   that we may be assured that God will do that, in all ages, which he
   then did, to the end the gospel may at length break through all
   impediments of the enemies, and that the more the Church is diminished,
   it may the more increase through the heavenly blessing.

   25 And Barnabas and Paul. The ministry which Luke saith Barnabas and
   Paul did finish, must be referred unto the alms, whereof mention was
   made before. For after that Agabus the prophet had foretold the famine
   and barrenness, the brethren gathered money at Antioch, whereby they
   might relieve the necessity of the church which was at Jerusalem; the
   carrying of this money was committed to Barnabas and Paul. Now Luke
   saith that they returned to Antioch, that he may pass over unto a new
   history. He addeth, that they took with them John, whose surname was
   Mark, whose mother was honorably commended before, that he might keep
   them company, who was afterward, as we shall see, a cause of grievous
   and dangerous [hurtful] discord between them.

   CHAPTER 13
     __________________________________________________________________

   Acts 13:1-3

   1. And there were in the church which was at Antioch certain prophets
   and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon, called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, and
   Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod and Saul. 2. And as they
   ministered unto the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate to
   me Barnabas and Saul unto the work whereto I have called them. 3. Then
   after they had fasted and prayed, and laid the hands upon them, they
   let them go.


   Here followeth an history, not only worthy to be remembered, but also
   very profitable to be known, how Paul was appointed the teacher of the
   Gentiles; for his calling was, as it were, a key whereby God opened to
   us the kingdom of heaven. We know that the covenant of eternal life was
   properly concluded with the Jews, so that we had nothing to do with
   God's inheritance, forasmuch as we were strangers, (Ephesians 2:12;)
   and the wall of separation was between, which did distinguish those of
   the household from strangers. Therefore it had profited us nothing,
   that Christ brought salvation unto the world, unless, the disagreement
   being taken away, there had been some entrance made for us into the
   Church. The apostles had already received commandment touching the
   preaching of the gospel throughout the whole world, (Mark 16:16,) but
   they had kept themselves until this time within the borders of Judea.
   When Peter was sent to Cornelius, it was a thing so new and strange,
   that it was almost counted a monster, [prodigy.] Secondly, that might
   seem to be a privilege granted to a few men extraordinarily; but now,
   forasmuch as God doth plainly and openly appoint Paul and Barnabas to
   be apostles of the Gentiles, by this means he maketh them equal with
   the Jews; that the gospel may begin to be common as well to the one as
   to the other. And now the wall of separation is taken away, that both
   those who were far off and those which were nigh hand may be reconciled
   to God; and that being gathered under one head, they may grow together
   to be one body. Therefore Paul's calling ought to be of no less weight
   amongst us, than if God should cry from heaven in the hearing of all
   men, that the salvation, promised in times past to Abraham, and to the
   seed of Abraham, (Genesis 22:17) doth no less appertain unto us at this
   day, than if we had come out of the loins of Abraham. For this cause is
   it that Paul laboreth so much [772] in defense and avouching of his
   calling, (Galatians 1:17, 12-24;) that the Gentiles may assuredly
   persuade themselves that the doctrine of the gospel was not brought to
   them by chance, neither by man's rashness, but, first, by the wonderful
   counsel of God; secondly, by express commandment, whilst that he made
   that known to men which he had decreed with himself.

   1 There were in the church. I have declared in the fourth to the
   Ephesians, (Ephesians 4:11) and in the twelfth of the First to the
   Corinthians, (1 Corinthians 12:28,) what difference there is (at least
   in my judgment) between doctors and prophets. It may be that they are
   in this place synonyma, [synonymous,] (or that they signify both one
   thing,) so that this is Luke's meaning, that there were many men in
   that church endowed with singular grace of the Spirit to teach. Surely
   I cannot see how it can hang together, to understand by prophets those
   which were endowed with the gift of foretelling things; but I think
   rather that it signifieth excellent interpreters of Scripture. And such
   had the office to teach and exhort, as Paul doth testify in the
   fourteenth of the First to the Corinthians, (1 Corinthians 45:37.) We
   must mark Luke's drift: Paul and Barnabas were ministers of the church
   of Antioch; God calleth them thence now unto another place. Lest any
   man should think that that church was destitute of good and fit
   ministers, so that God did provide for other churches with the loss of
   it, Luke preventeth this, and saith, that there was such store there,
   that though it did help others, yet did there remain sufficient for the
   use thereof; whereby appeareth how plentifully God had poured out his
   grace upon the Church, whence rivers, as it were, might be deducted and
   carried into diverse places.

   So even in our time God doth so enrich certain churches more than
   others, that they be seminaries to spread abroad the doctrine of the
   gospel. It must needs be that Manaen, who was brought up with Herod,
   came of some noble family. And this doth Luke recite of purpose that he
   may set forth to us his godliness who, despising worldly pomp, had
   coupled himself to the simple and despised flock of Christ. He might,
   indeed, have been a principal courtier if he had been ruled by
   ambition; but that he may wholly addict himself to Christ, he refuseth
   not to change those smokes of honor with [for] reproach and ignominy.
   For if we consider in what state the Church stood then, he could not
   give his name to the gospel, unless he should make himself subject
   [773] to common infamy. Therefore the Lord meant to teach us, by his
   example, to despise the world, that those may learn with a valiant and
   lofty mind to despise the world, who cannot otherwise be true
   Christians, unless they cast away those things which are precious to
   the flesh, as hurtful lets and hindrances.

   2 And they ministered to the Lord. The word which Luke useth doth not
   only signify to be occupied about holy things, but also sometimes to
   bear public offices. And because the holy rites of the Gentiles did for
   the most part consist upon [of] burnt-offerings and sacrifices, it is
   oftentimes taken for to offer sacrifice; which sense did well like the
   Papists, that they might prove that the apostles did use some
   sacrifice. But admit it were so; yet do they foolishly pretend for
   defense of their mass, that the teachers of Antioch did sacrifice.
   First, forasmuch as the word is of the plural number, it followeth that
   every one of them did say mass. But letting toys pass, I say we must
   consider what manner of sacrifice Christ commended to his Church. The
   Papists feign that the office of priesthood is enjoined them, to
   sacrifice Christ and by sacrificing him to redeem peace with God. There
   is so little mention made hereof in Scripture, that the Son of God doth
   rather challenge this honor to himself alone. Wherefore Christ's Church
   hath another priesthood, to wit that every man may offer himself and
   his to God; and that the public ministers may sacrifice to God, souls,
   with the spiritual sword of the gospel, as Paul teacheth, (Romans
   15:16.) Moreover, the prayers of all the godly are the spiritual calves
   of the lips, (Hosea 14:2,) wherewith God is well pleased, when they are
   offered up upon the holy altar; that is, in Christ's name, [as] in the
   thirteenth to the Hebrews, (Hebrews 13:15.) Therefore, when Luke saith
   that the prophets and teachers ministered to God when the Spirit spake
   to them, I understand nothing else but that they were in the public
   action. He addeth fasting, that we may know that their minds were then
   free from all impediments, that nothing might hinder them from giving
   attendance to prophesying. But the question is, [774] whether they kept
   a common fast, or Luke doth only signify that they were fasting then
   until that time. This is, without question, that these circumstances
   were expressed, that Paul's calling may carry the more credit amongst
   us.

   Separate to me. God commandeth that Paul and Barnabas be sent by the
   consent of the Church, thither whither he had appointed them to be
   sent; whereby we gather that there is no lawful election of pastors,
   save only wherein God is chief. For whereas he hath commanded that the
   Church should elect pastors and bishops, he hath not therefore granted
   men so much liberty, but that he will bear the chief sway as the chief
   governor. The ordinary election of pastors differeth from this
   appointing of Paul and Barnabas, because it was requisite that they
   should be appointed by the heavenly oracle to be the apostles of the
   Gentiles; which is not necessary to be done daily in ordaining pastors.
   But they agree in this, that as God did testify that Paul and Barnabas
   were already appointed by his decree to preach the gospel, so none may
   be called unto the office of teaching save only those whom God hath
   already chosen to himself after a sort.

   Furthermore, there is no need that the Spirit should cry to us out of
   heaven, that he is called of God about whom we are, [775] because we
   receive those, as it were, from hand to hand, (as they say,) whom God
   hath furnished with necessary gifts, forasmuch as they are framed and
   made fit by his hand. But whereas Luke saith in this place, that Paul
   was appointed by the voices and consents [776] of the Church; it doth
   seem not to agree with Paul's own words, where he doth deny that he was
   called of men, or by men, (Galatians 1:1.) I answer, that he was made
   an apostle long before, (and that by no voices [suffrages] of men,)
   before such time as he was sent unto the Gentiles; and he had now
   already executed the office of an apostle many years, when he was
   called to go unto the Gentiles by a new oracle. Wherefore, that he may
   have God for the author of his apostleship, it is not without cause
   that he excludeth men. And he doth not now command that he be ordained
   by the Church therefore, [viz.] that his calling may depend upon men;
   but God publisheth that his decree, which was as yet known to a few,
   and that with a public commandment, and he commandeth that it be sealed
   with the solemn subscription of the Church. Therefore, this is the
   meaning of the words, That this is the time wherein Paul must preach
   the gospel among the Gentiles, and the wall being pulled down, he must
   gather a Church of the Gentiles, who were before strangers from the
   kingdom of God, (Ephesians 2:14.) For although God had used him
   hitherto at Antioch and elsewhere, this was now added as a peculiar
   thing, that God did intend to adopt the Gentiles into the same
   inheritance of life with the Jews. But and if he were thus created a
   teacher of the Church from the beginning, he should not then have been
   called at that time by men. For, seeing the Lord doth pronounce that he
   had called him, what doth he leave for the Church, save only that they
   subscribe obediently? For men's judgment is not here put as in a
   doubtful matter, neither have their voices and consents any freedom.
   But we must mark what I have already said, that Paul and Barnabas are
   not now only appointed teachers, but they have an extraordinary office
   enjoined them, that they may begin to bring the grace of God commonly
   unto the Gentiles. And that do the words import, when it is said,
   Separate to the work For undoubtedly he speaketh of a new work, and
   which had heretofore not been used.

   But how is Barnabas in this place appointed to be Paul's companion and
   fellow in office, who, as far as we can read, did never execute the
   office of teaching? yea, who did always give Paul leave to teach,
   without saying anything himself? I answer, that he had occasions enough
   offered him to speak in Paul's absence, so that they had both of them
   enough to do. For one could not always be present in all places. It is
   not to be doubted but that he did faithfully discharge that duty which
   God had enjoined him, and that he was no dumb looker on. And why should
   we wonder that Luke doth not set down his sermons in plain words,
   seeing that he scarce repeateth one of a thousand of Paul's?

   The Spirit said. Whatsoever Macedonius and his sect object that they
   may turn their backs, [777] yet we have a more plain and sound
   testimony of the divine essence of the Spirit in this place, than that
   they can escape it and make it frustrate. There is nothing more proper
   to God than with his power and commandment to govern the Church alone;
   but the Spirit challengeth this right when he commandeth that Paul and
   Barnabas be separated to him, and testifieth that they were called by
   his beck. Assuredly we must needs confess that the body of the Church
   is lame and without a head, unless we confess that it is God who
   ordereth the same at his pleasure, who setteth teachers over it, who
   governeth the proceedings and order thereof. We shall have afterwards
   chapter 20, in Paul's sermon, (Acts 20:28,) that all bishops are placed
   by the Holy Ghost, which govern the Church; but no man is to be counted
   a lawful pastor of the Church, as the same Paul witnesseth, save he
   which is called of God; neither doth God point out false prophets by
   any other mark, save only by this, that he hath not sent them;
   therefore, we gather that the Holy Ghost is God indeed, whose authority
   is sufficient to choose pastors, and who hath the chief rule in
   choosing them, which is likewise confirmed out of the words of Isaiah,

   "And now, behold, the Lord hath sent me, and his Spirit,"
   (Isaiah 48:16.)

   Furthermore, we must note out of these words, that he is a person truly
   subsisting in God; for if we admit Sabellius's invention, that the word
   Spirit importeth no person, [778] but that it is a bare adjunct,
   [epithet] that shall be a foolish and absurd speech, that the Holy
   Ghost hath said, [779] Isaias also should foolishly ascribe to him the
   sending of a prophet.

   3. When they had fasted and prayed. That they may obey the oracle, they
   do not only send Paul and Barnabas away; but also with a solemn rite
   they appoint them to be the apostles of the Gentiles; it is without
   question that this was a public fast. Luke said before, that they were
   fasting, forasmuch as they were busied in their ministry: it might be
   that that was according to the custom; but now there is another reason,
   for in appointing a public fast, which used to be done in hard matters
   and of great importance, they provoke both themselves and others unto
   an earnest ferventness in prayer, for this is oftentimes added in
   Scripture as a help to prayer; but (it was a matter of such weight to
   erect the kingdom of Christ amongst the Gentiles) the teachers of
   Antioch do not without cause earnestly pray the Lord, that he will
   enable his servants; [780] and that was not the end of their prayer,
   that God would, by his Spirit of wisdom and discretion, govern their
   judgments in choosing, because all disputation or doubting concerning
   this matter was taken away; but that God would furnish those with the
   Spirit of wisdom and strength whom he had already chosen to himself,
   that he would strengthen them with his power against all the invasions
   of Satan and the world, that he would bless their labors, that they
   might not be unfruitful, that he would open a gate for the new
   preaching of the gospel.

   The laying on of hands which Luke reckoneth up, in the third place, was
   a kind of consecration, as we have said, (Acts 6:6.) For the apostles
   retained the ceremony which was used amongst the Jews, according to the
   old custom of the law; as also kneeling, and such rites, which were
   profitable to exercise godliness. In sum, this is the end why they laid
   their hands upon Barnabas and Paul, that the Church might offer them to
   God, and that they might with their consent declare that this office
   was enjoined them by God; for the calling was properly God's alone, but
   the external ordaining did belong to the Church, and that according to
   the heavenly oracle.

   Acts 13:4-12

   4. Therefore, when they were sent forth by the Holy Ghost, they went to
   Seleucia, and thence they sailed into Cyprus. 5. And when they were at
   Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews;
   and they had John, also for their minister. 6. And when they had passed
   over the island unto Paphos, they found a certain false prophet, a Jew,
   named Bar-jesus, 7. Who was with Sergius Paulus, the proconsul, a wise
   wan; who, when he had called Barnabas and Paul, sought to hear the word
   of God. 8. And Elymas, the sorcerer, (for so is his name expounded,)
   resisted them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. 9.
   And Saul, which was also called Paul, being full of the [Holy] Ghost,
   and looking steadfastly on him, 10. Said, O thou that art full of all
   deceit and wickedness, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all
   righteousness, dost thou not cease to pervert the straight ways of the
   Lord? 11. And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou
   shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And forthwith there fell
   upon him mist and darkness, and, going about, he sought some to lead
   him by the hand. 12. Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, he
   believed, wondering at the doctrine of the Lord,


   4. Being sent out by the Holy Ghost. There is no mention made here of
   the election made by the Church, because it was altogether a divine
   calling; the Church did only receive those who were offered them by the
   hand of God. He saith, that they came first to Seleucia, which was a
   city of Syria. There was, indeed, a country of the same name; but it is
   more likely that Luke speaketh of the city, which was not far from
   Cyprus by sea.

   5. He saith that they began to preach the gospel first in Salamis, a
   famous city of Cyprus. Notwithstanding, they seem to begin amiss; for
   whereas they were sent specially to the Gentiles, they preach the word
   of God, nevertheless, to the Jews, I answer, that they were not so
   addicted to the Gentiles, that, setting aside the Jews, it stood them
   upon to go straight to the Gentiles, for when God did make them
   teachers of the Gentiles, he did not depose them from the office which
   they had heretofore exercised; so that there was no reason to let them,
   but that they might take pains, both with Jews and Gentiles; [781] yea,
   farther, it was meet that they should begin with the Jews, as we shall
   see in the end of the chapter. Moreover, Luke addeth by the way, that
   they were helped by John; for his meaning is not that he was their
   minister for any private use, or for the uses of body; but rather in
   that he was their helper to preach the gospel, he commandeth his godly
   study [zeal] and industry; not that the degree of honor was equal, but
   because the labor was common to all; for which cause he had the less
   excuse afterward, seeing that he forsook the holy calling.

   6. When they had passed over. It is to be thought that this their
   passage was not altogether without fruit; and, assuredly, Luke would
   never have passed over with silence a general repulse; but it was
   sufficient for him to say that they were not idle in the office of
   teaching in their journey, seeing that he maketh haste unto a famous
   history, which he will set down immediately. And forasmuch as Salamis,
   situated upon the east coast, did look toward Syria, it was requisite
   that Paul and Barnabas should pass through the midst of the island unto
   the other side, that they might come to Paphos; for Paphos was a city
   situated upon the sea-coast toward the south. Furthermore though all
   the island was dedicated to Venus, yet Paphos was the principal seat of
   the idol. For which cause the goodness of God is more wonderful, in
   that he would have the light of his gospel to pierce into such a filthy
   and cruel [dire] den. For we may thereby gather what manner of
   integrity and chastity, and honesty and temperance, was in that city,
   in that religion did grant liberty to the inhabitants to commit all
   manner of shameful and heinous offenses.

   They found a certain fake prophet. Seeing that religion was quite
   corrupt among the Jews, it is no marvel if they fell away unto many
   wicked superstitions. And forasmuch as they had hitherto professed that
   they worshipped a certain peculiar god, this was a fair color to
   deceive withal, seeing that they might pretend the name of the unknown
   God at their pleasure; but this is a wonder how it was possible for
   Elymas, with his juggling, to cozen a grave and wise man. For we know
   that the Jews were at that time hated of all the world, and especially
   of the Romans, and with hatred was coupled extreme contempt of them.

   Now Luke doth not without cause expressly commend Sergius's wisdom,
   lest any man should think that his foolishness and lightness was
   subject to the seducings of the sorcerer. His meaning was, indeed, to
   show in a clear mirror how frivolous and vain man's wisdom is, which
   cannot beware of such gross subtlety of Satan.

   And assuredly where the truth of God doth not appear, the more men seem
   to be wise, the more filthily foolish are they. We see what filthy
   monsters of superstition did reign amongst the most witty Gentiles, and
   such as were furnished with all manner of learning. Therefore, there is
   neither judgment nor wisdom, save only from the Spirit of God. And this
   is the just vengeance of God upon all idolaters, that being delivered
   up to a reprobate sense they can discern nothing, (Romans 1:28.) Though
   it may be that Sergius Paulus, being weary of superstitions, did then
   begin to desire a more pure worship of God, at such time as he [did]
   light upon that sorcerer. Which if we receive, it was surely a
   wonderful judgment of God, that he suffered a man godly-affected to
   throw himself headlong into the [deadly] snares of Satan. But God doth
   sometimes so exercise his elect, that he causeth them to wander many
   ways, before they be directed into the right way.

   7. And whereas Sergius Paulus, desiring some better thing than that
   which he had learned from his childhood, was unaptly drawn aside unto
   diverse superstitions, I gather hereby that he sendeth for Paul and
   Barnabas of his own accord, to teach him. Therefore, he had conceived a
   certain reverence and fear of God, though he knew him not as yet; and
   forasmuch as he was persuaded that that was the true God which was
   worshipped in Judea, he desired to know out of his word a pure and
   certain rule of godliness. So soon as he hath tasted of the dotings of
   the false prophet he standeth in doubt. And it is not to be doubted,
   but that God doth solicit his mind, that he may not be altogether
   stayed in vanity, though he suffered himself to be deceived for a time
   by a wicked man.

   8. To turn away the deputy from the faith. No marvel if the seducer
   seek to put away the light, whereby he saw his own darkness driven
   away. [782] The same stour [contest] have we at this day with a number
   of babblers, who use to sell their smokes, and to shut, by all shifts
   possible, the eyes of the simple, that they may not behold the Sun of
   righteousness, being now risen. We must wrestle with such lets; for as
   there be [not] always and everywhere magicians present, which procure
   us some business, [783] Satan thrusteth in lets [784] enough, which
   possess our minds to drive away Christ, which the flesh is too ready to
   receive. Finally, both the enticements of the world and the wicked
   affections of our flesh are as many charms, whereby Satan ceaseth not
   to overthrow the faith.

   9. And Saul, who was also called Paul. Luke showeth now how God brake
   the bond wherein the deputy was bound. For seeing that he was too much
   addicted to the magician, he could not embrace true doctrine as one
   that was free and at liberty; for the devil keepeth those minds (which
   he hath entangled) in his slavery after a wonderful and incredible
   manner, that they cannot see even the most plain truth; but so soon as
   he was once vanquished, Paul could easily enter in unto the deputy. And
   mark what Luke saith, that the faith is overthrown when the word of God
   is resisted. Whence we may gather that faith is so grounded in the
   word, that without this shore [785] it fainteth at every assault; yea,
   that it is nothing else but the spiritual building of the word of God.

   10. O thou full of deceit. It was not without a cause that Paul was
   thus hot and angry; for he had no hope to do any good if he should deal
   after some moderate and mild sort. We must always begin with doctrine,
   and those are also to be admonished, exhorted, and pricked forward, who
   do not as yet appear to be altogether obstinate. Neither doth Paul so
   vehemently inveigh against the sorcerer at the first dash; but when he
   seeth him maliciously and manifestly fight against the doctrine of
   godliness, he handleth him like a bond-slave of Satan. Thus must we
   deal with the desperate enemies of the gospel, in whom appeareth open
   contumacy and wicked contempt of God, especially when they stop the way
   before others, And lest any man should think that Paul was out of
   measure angry, Luke saith plainly that the inspiration of the Spirit
   was his guide. Wherefore this heat of zeal is not only not to be
   reprehended, but it ought to make the profane condemners of God sore
   afraid, who fear not to rebel against his word; forasmuch as this
   judgment is given upon them all not by mortal man, but by the Holy
   Ghost, by the mouth of Paul.

   As touching the words, this place refuteth their error who think that
   Paul took his name of the deputy, as if he had set up some token of
   victory. There may many reasons be brought, and those strong enough, on
   the contrary; but this one place is sufficient, where Luke showeth that
   at such time as the deputy was not brought to the faith he had two
   names. And it is not to be doubted but that he retained his own name
   [786] amongst the Jews; and we know that this was a usual thing, that
   those who were citizens of Rome should borrow some Italian name. Luke
   joineth subtlety with deceit, which is contrary to sincerity; to wit,
   whilst crafty men transform their wit hither and thither, so that they
   have in them no simplicity; though the Greek word which Luke useth
   signifieth ready boldness to do hurt; but the former signification
   agreeth better. By the son of the devil is meant a reprobate and
   desperate man. Such are all those which resist maliciously, and as it
   were of set purpose, that which is just and right; therefore Paul
   addeth, that he is a great enemy of all righteousness.

   Dost thou not cease to pervert? He calleth all that means whereby the
   Lord bringeth us unto himself the ways of the Lord. He testifieth that
   this is plain and straight; and he accuseth the sorcerer for making the
   same crooked, full of turnings, and doubtful, with his boughts and
   turns. Whence may be gathered a profitable doctrine, that it cometh to
   pass through the subtlety of Satan that we do not readily, with
   straight course, go unto the Lord. For he showeth us in his word a
   plain way, and such as is not thorny. Wherefore we must take good heed
   of seducers, which trouble the way with their ditches or thorns, or
   else make the same hard and unpleasant.

   And it shall be convenient to repeat here that which I touched before,
   that the servants of Christ must not be blamed if they do sore inveigh
   against the professed enemies of sound doctrine, unless we will accuse
   the Holy Ghost of intemperance. Neither am I ignorant how easily men
   may fall in this point; for which cause godly teachers must take so
   much the more heed, first, that they favor not the affections of the
   flesh too much under the color of zeal; secondly, that they break not
   out with headlong and unseasonable heat where there is yet place for
   moderation; thirdly, that they give not themselves over to foolish and
   uncomely railing, but only that they express the unseemliness of the
   thing by gravity and weight of words. Such was the vehemency of holy
   zeal and of the Spirit in the prophets, which if dainty and soft men
   judge troublesome and raging, they consider not how dear and precious
   God's truth is to him.

   Now there riseth not one Elymas to subvert the faith but many, and
   those which are far more wicked. For we see with what sacrilegious
   boldness they despoil God of all honor; with what filthy corruptions
   they profane all religion; how cruelly they throw miserable souls
   headlong into eternal destruction; how unseemly they mock Christ; how
   filthily they disfigure all the whole worship of God; with what cruel
   reproaches they rend the holy truth of God; with what barbarous tyranny
   they lay waste the Church of God; so that you would say that they tread
   God under foot. And yet there be many crabbed philosophers who would
   have these furious giants flattered and clawed by the back. [787] But
   forasmuch as it doth evidently appear that such did never taste what
   that meaneth, "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up," (Psalm 69:9,)
   let us, bidding adieu to their coldness, or rather sluggishness, be
   most hot, [788] as becometh us, in maintaining the glory of God.

   11. Behold the hand. The hand is put here to punish; [789] a whereby he
   doth signify that God is the author of this punishment, and that he is
   only the minister. Furthermore, I think that this hability is that
   which Paul calleth dunamis, or power, (1 Corinthians 12:28.) For as
   they did excel in power of the Spirit to help the faithful with
   miracles, so had they the whip in their hand to tame the rebellious and
   obstinate withal. Such vengeance of God did Peter show upon Ananias and
   Sapphira, (Acts 5:5.) But because miracles ought, for the most part, to
   resemble the nature of Christ, who is all gentle, sweet, bountiful, and
   merciful; therefore he would seldom have the apostles to show examples
   of the contrary power. Neither must we think that they were endued with
   this power to punish any man so often as it seemeth good in their own
   eyes, but the same Spirit of God, which did thus arm them, did direct
   them unto the lawful and right use. Therefore we must remember that
   which we had before, that Paul spake by inspiration of the Spirit.
   Furthermore, it was a very fit kind of punishment. For seeing that the
   sorcerer essayed to darken the sun, and to take from others the benefit
   of the light, he was, by good right, cast into horrible darkness.

   But now, forasmuch as many of the Papists do far exceed this sorcerer
   at this day in ungodliness, it is a wonder why they be suffered to be
   so bold without being punished. Is the hand of God weakened? Is he less
   careful for his glory? Hath he no care to revenge the gospel? I answer,
   that this visible punishment which was once laid [790] upon the
   sorcerer, and such as this, are perpetual examples of God's wrath
   against all those who are not afraid either to corrupt and deprave, or
   openly with slanders to resist the pure doctrine of the gospel. For we
   do know that miracles were wrought for a time to this end, that they
   may continually be in force, and be fresh before our eyes, and that
   they may give us light to behold the judgments of God, which we cannot
   see so plainly; but it is not for us to prescribe God this or that way
   to punish his enemies. Sergius Paulus, who, before he came to man's
   estate, had no taste of true religion, who, from his childhood, was
   infected with diverse superstitions, and had very hard lets, which kept
   him back from embracing the faith; lastly, who was bewitched with the
   dotings of the sorcerer, that he could scarce come to the faith, had
   need of no small helps. Hereby it came to pass that God did, as it
   were, reach his hand out of heaven manifestly, though he helped us all
   in his person; for the same gospel, the authority whereof was then
   established, is at this day preached to us, and yet, notwithstanding,
   God doth not so linger, but that he showeth his fearful power diverse
   ways against the enemies of the gospel, unless our eyes were so dull
   when he showeth his judgments that we cannot see.

   12. Then when the deputy saw This is that which I said, that the snares
   were broken wherein Elymas kept him entangled, for he was brought by
   the miracle unto faith, because the reverence of doctrine is the
   beginning of faith, and the preparation. Therefore, forasmuch as he saw
   an evident token of the power of God, he knew that Paul was sent of
   God, and so he began to reverence his doctrine, whereof he did doubt
   before. If God do now miraculously strengthen in the minds of many the
   faith of the gospel, which is shaken with so many and such strong
   engines; if he bring to pass, after an incredible manner, that the
   course of faith doth pass through a thousand lets, being content with
   this his grace, let us not murmur against him, or reason the matter
   with him, as if our condition were worse, if he do not daily show such
   miracles as we would desire.

   Acts 13:13-15

   13. And when Paul's companions had loosed from Paphos, they came to
   Perga of Pamphylia; and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
   14. Furthermore, when they had passed over the country of Perga, they
   came to Antioch, a city of Pisidia, and entered into the synagogue upon
   the day of the Sabbaths, and sat 15. And after the lecture of the law
   and prophets, the master of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men and
   brethren, if there be in you any word of exhortation unto the people,
   say on.


   13. Here is set down another of Paul's stations; for, being departed
   from Paphos, when he came to Antioch of Pisidia, he made there a worthy
   [791] sermon, which Luke will recite, together with the success; but
   before he come to that, he doth by the way speak of the departure of
   John, because it was afterwards a cause of doleful disagreement. When
   he saith, Paul's companions loosed from Paphos, he doth, in the first
   place, mean Paul himself; secondly, the other, one excepted. So that by
   noting his softness, he praiseth others which followed Paul with great
   [792] constancy.

   14. Entering, upon the day of the Sabbaths. He putteth the plural
   number instead of the singular, as it falleth out oftentimes in other
   places of Scripture; for they were wont to assemble themselves together
   upon the Sabbaths, lest their rest should be unprofitable and sluggish.
   The institution of the Sabbath had another end also, that it might be a
   figure of the spiritual rest when as the faithful, being dead to the
   world and the flesh, abandon their own will, and cease from their
   works. Because we have the truth hereof in Christ, whilst that being
   buried together with him we put off the old man; therefore the old
   figure is past. But God had respect also unto the politic use, that the
   Jews, being free from all other cares and businesses, might keep their
   holy assemblies; so that the ceasing off from earthly works did give a
   place to their heavenly exercises. So, even at this day we must use
   holy days; for we must therefore omit all other things that we may the
   more freely serve God.

   15. After the lecture [reading] of the law. There is no mention made of
   prayers, and yet, undoubtedly, they were not omitted or foreslowed,
   [neglected;] but because Luke did intend to set down the sermon made
   there by Paul, no marvel if he reckon up those things only which did
   belong unto the order of teaching. And this is a notable place, out of
   which we learn after what sort they handled doctrine at that time among
   the Jews. The law and the prophets had the first place; because there
   must nothing be set before the Church which was not drawn out of that
   fountain. Also we gather by this that the Scripture was not suppressed
   among a few, but that both one and other [793] were admitted to the
   reading thereof, afterward those who were able, and had the grace to
   teach and exhort, had the second place, as interpreters of the
   Scripture which was read. Notwithstanding Luke showeth, last of all,
   that every one was not suffered to speak, lest confusion should arise
   by liberty; but the office of exhorting was committed to certain men,
   whom he calleth rulers of the synagogue, or masters. Therefore Paul and
   Barnabas begin not forthwith to speak, lest they disturb the accustomed
   order with too much haste; but they do modestly stay till they have
   liberty granted them to speak, and that with their leave who had
   authority by public consent. We know how corrupt the state of that
   people was then; and Luke will at length declare, in the end of the
   chapter, that these men of Antioch were too stout and stubborn in
   receiving [794] the grace of Christ; and yet there remained this
   goodness among them, that their assemblies were honestly and decently
   governed; [795] for which cause such evil favored confusion is so much
   the more shame fill which is seen at this day among those who will be
   counted Christians. The Papists do indeed sing [796] the Scriptures in
   their churches with shrill and sounding voice, but in an unknown
   tongue, so that the people reap no fruit thereby. There is seldom any
   doctrine used; and it were better for the wicked babblers even then to
   hold their peace, who thrust in their own unclean inventions instead of
   the Word of God, and pollute with the stink of their impiety whatsoever
   is holy.

   If there be in you? This speech doth signify that what grace soever is
   in men to edify the Church, it is, as it were, committed [797] to them;
   although the word in, according to the Hebrew phrase, may be
   superfluous. Therefore, I stand not greatly upon that, because the
   sense may be plain, If you have any exhortation which is apt and
   profitable for the people. An exhortation doth not exclude doctrine.
   But it seemeth that this word was commonly used among them; because it
   is properly the office of the teacher to utter no new thing of his own
   brain, but to apply the Scripture, wherein is comprehended the whole
   wisdom of the godly, unto the present use of the people. Thus, they do
   not only teach, but also apply the doctrine which they have elsewhere,
   unto the edifying of the Church, which I think is meant by the word
   exhortation.

   Acts 13:16-23

   16. And Paul rose, and when he had given a token of silence with the
   hand, he said, Men and brethren, which fear God, hear. 17. The God of
   this people did choose our fathers, and exalted the people, when they
   were strangers in the land of Egypt; and he brought them thence with an
   high arm. 18. And about forty years he suffered their manners in the
   wilderness. 19. And having destroyed seven nations in the land of
   Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance. 20. After these
   things, about four hundred and fifty years, he gave them judges, until
   Samuel the prophet. 21. Afterward they required a king, and God gave
   them Saul, the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty
   year's. 22. And when he had taken him away, he raised up to them David
   to be king, of whom bearing witness, he said, I have found David, the
   son of Jesse, a man according to my heart, who shall do all my will.
   23. Of whose seed God, according to promise, raised to Israel the
   Savior, Jesus.


   16. We must note the state of this sermon, lest we think that he
   uttered words in vain. Paul seemeth, indeed, to begin even at the very
   first beginning, but he speaketh nothing but that which is most
   convenient for the present purpose. His purpose is to bring the Jews
   unto the faith of Christ; and that he may the better do this, it is
   needful to declare that they excel other nations in this one thing,
   because the Savior was promised them, whose kingdom is their principal
   and only felicity. This is, therefore, Paul's beginning, that whereas
   they were chosen in times past to be the peculiar people of God;
   whereas they had so many benefits bestowed upon them from time to time,
   though they showed themselves most unworthy, this did depend upon the
   promise of the Messiah, and did tend to that end, that God might govern
   them by the hand of the Messiah; and that therefore they have nothing
   whereof they may boast, unless they be gathered under their Head; yea,
   that unless they receive him when he is offered, the covenant of life
   which God had made with their fathers shall be void, and the adoption
   shall be frustrate. This is the drift of the first part of the sermon:
   that this is the principal point of the law and the foundation of God's
   covenant, that they have Christ for their Captain and Governor, that he
   may restore all things among them; that without him religion cannot
   stand, and that they shall be most miserable without him. Thence Paul
   passeth unto another member, that Jesus, whom he preacheth, is Christ
   indeed, through whom salvation is offered to the people; also he
   declareth the means of the redemption purchased by him. Furthermore, he
   intreateth of his power and office, that they may know what good things
   they ought to hope for at his hands. The conclusion containeth a
   chiding; for he threateneth to them horrible judgment, if they refuse
   the author of salvation, who offereth himself, even of his own accord,
   whom earnestly to desire the law and prophets provoke. This is, in a
   manner, the sum; now let us discuss every point by itself.

   Men and brethren. Because Paul knew that there were many bastardly sons
   of Abraham, or such as were grown out of kind, [798] he calleth the
   Jews to whom he speaketh by a double name. First, he calleth them
   brethren, having respect unto common kindred, notwithstanding he
   showeth therewithal that they shall be true Israelites if they fear
   God, and that even then they are likewise true hearers, because "the
   fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." In like sort he maketh
   the faithful attentive, and purchaseth audience among them, as if he
   should say, Seeing many boast that they are sons of Abraham, who were
   unworthy of such honor, show yourselves to be no bastardly seed. Let us
   learn by this that it is not a fault common to one age only, that good
   and sincere worshippers being mixed with hypocrites, have the name of
   the Church common among them. But we must have a great care hereof,
   that we be indeed that which we are called; which thing the true fear
   of Almighty God will bring to pass, and not the external profession
   alone.

   17. The God of this people. This preface did witness that Paul did go
   about no new thing, which might lead away the people from the law of
   Moses. There is but one God, who is God of all nations; but he calleth
   him God of that people, to whom he had bound himself, and who was
   worshipped amongst the posterity of Abraham, amongst whom alone true
   and pure religion was to be found. To the same end tendeth that which
   is added immediately, He chose our fathers. For he testifieth by these
   words that he seeketh nothing less [799] than that they may fall away
   from the true and living God, who hath separated them from the residue
   of the world. Neither do I doubt but that he did more manifestly
   express that he did not preach to them an unknown or strange God, but
   the same who revealed himself long ago to their fathers; so that he
   doth briefly comprehend the sound knowledge of God, grounded in the
   law, that their faith, conceived out of the law and prophets, may
   continue firm.

   Notwithstanding, he doth, in the mean season, commend and set forth the
   free love of God toward that people. For how came it to pass that only
   the children of Abraham were the Church and inheritance of God, save
   only because it pleased God to dissever them from other nations? For
   there was no worthiness to distinguish them; but the difference began
   at the love of God, wherewith he did freely love Abraham.

   Of this free love of God, Moses doth oftentimes put the Jews to mind,
   as Deuteronomy 4:7, 8, 10, 14, 32, 34, and in other places; wherein God
   did set before us a mirror of his wonderful counsel, in that finding no
   excellence in Abraham, an obscure person and miserable idolater, he
   doth, notwithstanding, prefer him before all the world. Furthermore,
   this election was common to all the people, as was also circumcision,
   whereby God did adopt to himself the seed of Abraham; but there was
   also a more hidden election, whereby severing to himself a few of many
   children of Abraham, he did declare, that not all who came of the seed
   of Abraham according to the flesh are reckoned in the spiritual stock.

   He did drive out a people. Paul teacheth that all those benefits which
   God bestowed afterwards upon the Jews, did proceed and flow from that
   free favor which he did bear toward their fathers. For this was the
   cause that they were delivered by the wonderful power of God, and
   brought by his hand into the possession of the land of Canaan, after
   that he had driven out so many nations for their sake. For it is no
   small matter for the land to be deprived of her inhabitants, that she
   might receive strangers. This is the fountain and root of all good
   things whereunto Paul calleth us, that God chose the fathers. This was
   the reason and cause which moved God to so great patience, that he
   would not cast off that rebellious people, who should otherwise have
   destroyed themselves a thousand times with their own wickedness.
   Therefore, where the Scripture maketh mention that their sins were
   pardoned, it saith that God remembered his covenant. He saith that they
   were exalted, though they were strangers, that they may remember how
   worthy and gorgeous their deliverance was.

   18. He suffered their manners. The compound verb hath greater force and
   grace in the Greek, whereby the mercifulness of God is expressed in
   suffering the people, whom he knew to be stubborn and disobedient. And
   Paul giveth us to understand again, that the election of God was the
   cause that his goodness did strive with the wickedness of the people.
   [800] Notwithstanding, we must note that God did so take pity upon his
   elect people, whilst that he will continue firm in his purpose, that he
   did, notwithstanding, sharply punish the rebellious and wicked. He
   spared the people indeed, so that he did not quite destroy them, as he
   might by good right; but he found also means that their wickedness
   might not remain unpunished. And so that of Isaiah was fulfilled,

   "If the multitude shall be as the sand of the sea,
   a remnant shall be saved," (Isaiah 10:22.)

   20. He gave them judges. Under this name the Scripture comprehendeth
   rulers and governors; and here is another testimony of the infinite
   goodness of God toward the Jews, in that he pardoned so many
   backslidings in them. For it is likely that Paul handled those things
   more at large, which Luke gathereth briefly. And we know what was the
   estate of the people during all that time, seeing that through untamed
   wantonness they did ever now and then shake off the yoke. They were
   often punished with most grievous plagues, yet so soon as they were
   once humbled, God delivered them from the tyranny of their enemies. So
   that he saved the body thereof alive, amidst many deaths, four whole
   ages and one-half. And hereby it appeareth how unworthy they were of
   the favor of God, which they did despise and reject so often, unless
   the constancy of the election had gotten the victory. For how is it
   that God is never wearied, but that he keepeth promise with those who
   are truce-breakers an hundred times, save only because turning his eyes
   toward his Christ, he hath not suffered his covenant, grounded in him,
   to decay or perish?

   21. Afterward they desire. And this change was all one as if they would
   quite and manifestly overthrow the government which he had appointed,
   whereof God himself complaineth in Samuel, (1 Samuel 8:5, 7.) But the
   stability of the election saved them from being punished as such
   madness did deserve; yea, the wicked and unlawful desire of the people
   was to God a new and incredible occasion to erect the kingdom whence
   Christ should afterward come. For how is it that the scepter came to
   the tribe of Judah, save only because the people were desirous to have
   a king? And assuredly the people dealt wickedly; but God, who knoweth
   how to use evil things well, turned that offense into safety. Whereas
   Saul was thrown down from the kingdom, it served to reprove the fault
   of the people, (1 Samuel 15:28,) but immediately when the kingdom is
   established in David's family the prophecy of Jacob was verified,
   (Genesis 49:10.)

   22. I have found David, my servant. This title was not so much cited in
   praise of the person, as that Paul might make the Jews more attentive
   to receive Christ. For the Lord doth testify that his mind was
   thoroughly set upon David for no light cause, but he commandeth in him
   some singular thing; and by extolling him so highly, his intent is to
   lift up the minds of the faithful unto Christ in his person. The place
   is taken out of the fourscore and ninth Psalm, (Psalm 89:20.) Only Paul
   putteth in that which is not there to be found, that David was the son
   of Isai, [Jesse,] which amplifieth the grace of God. For seeing that
   Isai [Jesse] was a breeder of cattle, it was a wonderful work of God to
   take the least of his sons from the sheepfolds, and to place him in the
   throne of the kingdom. By the word found, God meaneth that he had
   gotten such a man as he would. Not that David had brought to pass by
   his own travel and industry that he should meet God, being such a one,
   but the phrase is taken from the common custom of men.

   But the question is, Seeing that David fell so grievously, how God
   giveth testimony of his continual obedience? We may answer two ways;
   for God had respect rather unto the continual course of his life, than
   unto every of his particular actions. Secondly, he did thus set him
   forth, not so much for his own merit as for his Christ's sake.
   Assuredly he had deserved, by one wicked fact, eternal destruction for
   him and his, and, so much as in him lay, the way of the blessing of God
   was shut up, that there might nothing but vipers' seed come of
   Bathsheba. But that so filthy a fact, in the death of Uriah, (2 Samuel
   11:27) turneth to a contrary end by the wonderful counsel of God,
   because Solomon is born and cometh of that unlooked-for wedlock, which
   was full of treachery, and, finally, polluted with many spots. And
   though David sinned grievously, yet because he followed God all the
   course of his life, he is praised without exception, that he showed
   himself obedient to God in all things; though (as I have said before)
   the Spirit carrieth us into a farther thing; yea, the common calling of
   all the faithful in Christ, the head, is here depicted out to us.

   23. According to promise. This clause doth also prove that which I have
   already said elsewhere, that in sending Christ, the Lord had respect
   only unto his own faithfulness and goodness; for he sent him because he
   had promised so to do. And as the promise doth testify that salvation
   was free, so it doth also purchase no small credit to the gospel;
   because it appeareth by this that Christ came not at a sudden, of whom
   there was never anything spoken; but that he who was promised from the
   beginning was now given in his time. But the promises which Luke here
   toucheth by the way are famous and well known. And they were so common
   among the Jews, that they called Christ commonly by no other name but
   the Son of David, (Matthew 22:42; Matthew 15:22.) He saith that Jesus
   was raised up to Israel; because, though salvation belong to the whole
   world, yet was he first a minister of circumcision to fulfill the
   promises made to the fathers, (Romans 15:8.) He translated the Hebrew
   name Jesus into soter in Greek. So that he uttered one thing twice, and
   yet here is no superfluous repetition; because he meant to declare that
   Christ is indeed and doth perform that which the name given him by God,
   by the voice of the angel, doth import.

   Acts 13:24-26

   24. After that John had preached, before the face of his entrance, the
   baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 25. And when John
   fulfilled his course, he said, Whom do ye think me to be? I am not.
   But, behold, he cometh after me whose shoe latchets I am not worthy to
   loose. 26. Men and brethren, children of the generation of Abraham, and
   those who among you fear God, to you is the word of this salvation
   sent.


   24. We know what office John had, to wit, to prepare the way of the
   Lord. Therefore Paul bringeth in his testimony, that he may prove to
   the Jews that he preached no false Christ, but the true Christ of God,
   whom that most famous forerunner had before commended; not that man's
   testimony is sufficient to prove so weighty a matter; but there was
   another respect to be had to John whom all men almost did think to be a
   prophet of God. Therefore hence cometh the authority of the testimony,
   that a crier sent from heaven, and no private man, speaketh of Christ.
   And Paul reciteth two things summarily concerning John, that he taught
   the baptism of repentance before Christ's coming. Secondly, that
   casting from him of his own accord the title and honor of the Messiah,
   he submitted himself to Christ.

   The baptism of repentance. Baptism brought in contrary to the rite and
   custom of the law was a token of great alteration. For it was unlawful
   to renew anything before Christ's coming. The Jews had indeed in the
   law their baptisms or washings, which were also exercises of
   repentance, but John was the author of new and strange baptism, or
   rather the minister, who put them in hope of the restoring long
   looked-for and desired. When he calleth it the baptism of repentance he
   doth not exclude remission of sins, but he speaketh according to the
   circumstance of the place, because this baptism was a preparation unto
   the faith of Christ. And we must note the phrase, that he preached
   baptism. Whereby we are taught that the sacraments are then rightly
   administered, when doctrine is joined with the visible figure; for the
   mouth of the baptizer must not be dumb, because the sign is vain
   without doctrine.

   25. When John fulfilled his course. The second member of the testimony,
   that when John drew near to the end of his course he sent his disciples
   to Christ; for he had fashioned them before with the rudiment of
   baptism, and then he sent them to Christ (as they say) from hand to
   hand. And this interrogation, Whom do ye think me to be? is not a
   question of one that doubteth. For John reproveth and chideth the Jews,
   because they did falsely give to him the honor of the Messiah. Though
   it may be read in one text, I am not he whom you take me to be; yet the
   other reading is more usual, as it hath also greater force to refute
   the error. Furthermore, his testimony doth deserve greater credit, in
   that he doth willingly refuse the honor offered him, (which he might
   have taken to himself, not without commendations) and doth submit
   himself to another. There cannot, assuredly, be any suspicion of
   ambition, or of seeking after honor here, which may discredit his
   words.

   Behold, he cometh; that is, he is about to come, the Hebrew phrase,
   which is common enough in the New Testament. Whereas he confesseth that
   he is unworthy to loose the latchets of Christ's shoes, it is a
   proverbial figure, whereby he abaseth himself so much as he can, lest
   his greatness darken Christ's glory; for he meant to do that faithfully
   which was given him in charge, that Christ alone might have the
   preeminence. Therefore he saith, that how great soever he be, yet he is
   nothing in respect of Christ. For though God's servants have their
   dignity, yet being compared to Christ, they must all be as nothing,
   that he alone may excel; as we see all stars vanish away, that they may
   give place to the brightness of the sun.

   26. Men and brethren. Paul doth again prick forward the Jews to embrace
   Christ; for this ought to have raised no small study and attentiveness
   in their minds, when as they saw [heard] their salvation handled, and
   that the message of salvation was appointed properly for them. He
   calleth them children of Abraham not only for honor's sake, but that
   they may know that they be heirs of eternal life; and he speaketh them
   so fair that it might not grieve them to depart from the scribes and
   priests whom they worshipped, because they must needs receive Christ.
   Furthermore, we must remember that which I said before, though the gate
   of the kingdom of heaven were set open to the Gentiles, yet were not
   the Jews thrown down from their estate; but were counted the
   first-begotten in God's family; therefore is it that he saith, that
   salvation was sent to them, because they were first in order; yet
   because the carnal kindred was of itself of no great importance, and
   the ungodliness of many brake out, Paul speaketh specially unto the
   true worshippers of God, signifying that words were but vain, unless
   the fear of God reign in their hearts, which may receive them, and,
   receiving them, may foster them. We must note this title of the gospel,
   that it is called the word of salvation. Wherefore, their hardness must
   needs be great [801] whom it doth not allure with the sweetness that is
   in it; but though it be such naturally, yet is it made accidentally
   "the savor of death unto death" to the reprobate, (2 Corinthians 2:16.)

   Acts 13:27-31

   27. For those which dwelt in Jerusalem, and their rulers, seeing that
   they knew him not, neither the voices of the prophets which are read
   every Sabbath day; when they had condemned him, they fulfilled them.
   28. And when they found no cause of death in him, they desired Pilate
   that he would crucify him. 29. And after that they had fulfilled all
   things which were written of him, when they had taken him down from the
   tree, they put him in a tomb. 30. But God raised him up from the dead.
   31. Who appeared many days to those which went up with him from Galilee
   to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.


   27. He doth wisely, and in due time, prevent an offense which might
   have been a great hindrance to their faith, [men's faith.] For
   Jerusalem was God's sanctuary, the king's seat, the fountain of truth,
   and the light of the whole world; but Christ was put to death there.
   Furthermore, nothing could seem more absurd to look to than to receive
   him who was cast out of the temple of God; and to seek the doctrine of
   salvation any where else than there whence God himself had testified it
   should come. Moreover, by believing in Christ, they seemed to make a
   departure from the Church; and, therefore, this one objection was
   strong enough to refute all Paul's sermon, Why dost thou force upon us,
   under color of God's covenant, a man whom the principal part of the
   holy people condemned? This objection doth Paul answer, lest it hinder
   the course of the gospel; and not that only, but he turneth it also to
   the contrary part; for seeing that the author of life was despised and
   rejected at Jerusalem, Paul exhorteth the men of Antioch, at least
   those who among them feared God, that they receive him so much the more
   joyfully; for this doth the causal word declare, as if he should have
   said, Seeing that Jerusalem knew not her good, it behoveth you to be
   the more awakened and inflamed, lest the same unthankfulness and
   forwardness be found in you.

   But he useth another reason to remove the offense, to wit, that their
   ungodliness was so far from diminishing any whit of Christ's divine
   excellency, that it ought rather to serve to prove and establish the
   same, for whereby doth Christ better appear than because all that was
   fulfilled in him which had been foretold in the law and prophets? (Luke
   24:25, 26.) Furthermore, what got the enemies of Christ, save only that
   in him shined the plain truth of the Scripture? It must needs be that
   Christ should be rejected of the chief, for it was so foretold,

   "The stone which the builders refused hath
   God made the head of the corner," (Psalm 118:22.)

   Christ must needs have been condemned among the wicked, that he might
   acquit us before God; it was expedient that sins should be laid upon
   him, that he might make satisfaction for the same; that he should be
   offered upon the cross, that the shadowish sacrifices of the law might
   cease; for even the Scripture contained these things, (Isaiah 53:4, 5;
   Daniel 9:26.)

   Therefore, the more violently the captains of the people sought to
   extinguish Christ, they did in very deed prove him to be Christ, and
   the Lord did wonderfully deceive [frustrate] them, so that their
   obstinate impiety doth more edify the faith of the godly than destroy
   it. Of the same sort are almost all offenses which lead away weak and
   inconstant souls from Christ; for if they would thoroughly ponder the
   whole process of the work of God, there should be matter of
   confirmation where they faint. Therefore it cometh to pass, for the
   most part, that [802] we be troubled with offenses and
   stumbling-blocks, because, whilst we behold those things which belong
   to Christ with purblind eyes, [803] we imagine that to be black which
   is white; and we see how far Paul is from dissimulation, and how freely
   [804] he professeth the truth of the matter, that Christ was hated not
   only of the common sort, but also of the chief chieftains; and that he
   was not hissed at by a few, but oppressed by the wicked conspiracy of
   all the people. That was hard and hateful at the first conflict; but
   Paul opposeth a more strong engine, that God used them against their
   wills as a touchstone, whereby he might try his Son. Seeing that the
   gospel standeth in the same state at this day, let us not be ashamed,
   with Paul, to confess that the proud princes of the world, and those
   who bear the greatest sway in the Church, are the deadly enemies of
   Christ, seeing that doth rather turn to Christ's praise than reproach;
   for by this means is the Scripture fulfilled.

   Seeing they knew him not. Though deliberate malice did enforce the
   rulers to oppress Christ, yet doth Paul truly impute it to ignorance,
   [805] because otherwise they would never have crucified the Lord of
   glory, (1 Corinthians 2:8.) For the malice of the wicked is like to
   raging madness, and in seeing it doth not see. Undoubtedly, we need not
   doubt of this, that they were deprived of a sound mind and the light of
   the Spirit, who were not afraid to fight against God to their own
   destruction. Again, he hitteth them in the teeth with ignorance of the
   Scripture; and lest any should object that he speaketh of some dark and
   unknown manner; he addeth also, that he doth speak of no other
   prophecies than of those which are read every Sabbath day; as if he
   should say, that the oracles of Scripture are most plain and known to
   the most ignorant, and yet they knew them not. Thus doth Paul teach how
   monstrous their unbelief was, that he may make the hearers loathe it;
   and by this example are we taught, that although the Lord appears to us
   by the Scripture, yet all men have not eyes. After that also the
   blockishness of the nation waxed more gross, as Paul saith elsewhere,
   that there is a veil put before their face, that they cannot see Moses
   when he is present, (2 Corinthians 3:15.) In the mean season, we must
   note that we are recalled to the Scripture, lest the authority of great
   men deceive us, neither is there any cause why any man, inventing to
   himself a prejudice according to the wicked meaning of other men,
   should think that he is acquitted; for Paul exhorteth the men of
   Antioch to judge out of the Scripture against the visored governors of
   the Church; [806] for this cause is it given, that it may be read; and
   reading is not appointed in vain by the Lord; but that all godly men
   may thereby profit and judge what is right.

   This they fulfilled. So that we see that not only creatures void of
   understanding, but even the very devil, and also the wicked, are
   subject to the power [807] of God, that he may execute by them that
   which with himself he hath decreed. The same had we in the third and
   fourth chapters, (Acts 3:23; Acts 4:28,) that when the enemies of
   Christ did most of all rage to destroy him, yet could they not obtain
   their purpose; but rather they brought that to pass with their own
   hands which God had in his counsel determined; which thing maketh not a
   little for commendation of God's truth, because he is not only of
   sufficient power to perform those things which he hath promised; but
   also those who go about to bring his counsels to nought do their
   endeavor to establish them, though it be against their will. For how
   should not the truth of God stand which the chiefest enemies are
   enforced to fulfill? Yet wisdom is necessary here, lest we join God and
   Satan together.

   For the Jews are not therefore excusable, because they fulfilled the
   Scriptures; because we must consider their wicked will, and not the
   event, which they did not look for, yea, which ought to be counted a
   miracle. If we look into their work by itself, it is quite contrary to
   God; but as God doth, in the sun and other planets, by wonderful
   cunning, temper contrary motions, and such as strive among themselves,
   so he directeth the perverse endeavors of the wicked, by his secret
   power, unto another end than they thought upon and did desire, lest
   they should do any thing but that which he would. They, indeed, as
   touching themselves, do contrary to his will; but it falleth out
   according to the will of God after an incomprehensible manner.
   Forasmuch as this course is contrary to nature, no marvel if the wisdom
   of the flesh see it not. Therefore, it must be discerned with the eye
   of faith, or rather it must be reverenced; and those dogs who bark
   against it must be despised with their wantonness. [808]

   28. When as they found no cause of death. It was very pertinent to the
   matter that they should know that Christ was put to death guiltless,
   for we could not have been justified by his death, if he had suffered
   death for his own evil deeds; therefore it was requisite that he should
   be guiltless, that his death might be a satisfaction for the sins of
   the world. And, undoubtedly, I think that Paul did plainly declare that
   Pilate condemned Christ, not according to the office of a judge, but
   that he consented that he should be put to death after that he was
   overcome with the ungodly requests of the people; and also that the
   Jews were driven by lust, and not enforced by reason, to desire
   Christ's death.: For it stood him upon to terrify the hearers, that
   they might not couple themselves [809] to so wicked a fact. But Luke
   doth now in few words set down, after his common custom, those things
   which Paul did then more at large declare.

   29. When they had fulfilled all things; to wit, which it pleased God
   should be done by them. For they did so handle Christ that there was
   nothing of the prophecies of the Scripture left unfulfilled. By this
   means is the stumbling-block (which the understanding of the flesh
   conceiveth by reason of the ignominy of the cross) taken away, that the
   Son of God was not laid open to the furious fury of the wicked; but he
   obeyed his fathers decree. Furthermore, it doth also in Scripture
   appear what condition was appointed for him in times past. Whereas he
   saith that Christ was buried by the same which had slain him, it
   seemeth contrary to the history of the gospel; but it may be that Luke
   did take the word buried indefinitely. And if it please you to refer it
   unto the same, it shall be synecdoche. For he was buried with Pilate's
   leave; and at the appointment and pleasure of the priests there were
   watchmen set to watch the grave. Therefore, though Joseph and Nicodemus
   did bury Christ, (Matthew 27:57,) that is ascribed improperly, and yet
   not absurdly, to the Jews; because it is not Paul's drift in this place
   to commend the good deed, but to prove Christ's resurrection; because
   God took him out of the grave whom his enemies had shut up there.
   Therefore he giveth us to understand that the body of Christ was not
   taken thence privily or by stealth, but that it was laid in a place
   both famous and known to the adversaries; and so, consequently, that
   even they were set to watch it; and yet for all this it was not found:
   whence we may gather the certainty of the resurrection.

   30. God hath raised him up. The death of Christ was the salvation of
   the godly, yet joined with the resurrection; therefore doth Paul stand
   longer upon this second point. For he should never have persuaded his
   hearers that they were to seek salvation in Christ's death, unless the
   power of Almighty God had appeared in raising Christ from death.

   31. After that he hath said that Christ came out of the grave, which
   was beset with the hired ministers of the adversaries, he addeth now
   that he appeared to many of the disciples, which bare faithful witness
   to the people. And he calleth them witnesses, either in respect of
   their office; because they were chosen for this purpose, as we have
   already said in the first chapter, (Acts 1:8;) or else declaring simply
   that they professed openly and freely that which they knew concerning
   Christ. Whereupon it followeth that the matter was made known openly
   [810] at Jerusalem. And the proof was not so light; because, in the
   fearful power of the enemies, who were ready and bent to resist, and
   did omit nothing, there were, notwithstanding, such as did openly
   affirm that Christ rose again, and were also such as saw that thing
   with their eyes; for if there had been any refutation in readiness, the
   scribes would not have neglected it.

   Acts 13:32-37

   32. And we preach to you glad tidings, that the promise made to the
   fathers, 33. Hath God fulfilled to their children: having raised up
   Jesus, as it is written in the second Psalm, Thou art my Son, this day
   have I begotten thee. 34. And in that he hath raised him up from the
   dead, not to return hereafter to corruption, he hath said thus, I will
   give you the holy things of David. 35. Therefore he saith also in
   another place, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
   36. David, indeed, when he had served his time, by the counsel of God
   he fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption.
   37. But he whom God raised saw no corruption.


   32. We preach to you glad tidings. He doth now challenge to himself the
   office and honor of an apostle, that he may be heard as a lawful
   minister of God. And he saith the sum of the embassage enjoined him is,
   that that is revealed and given in their time which was promised in
   times past. And in few words doth he comprehend many and great matters.
   First, he giveth them to understand that he bringeth in nothing which
   is new, or contrary to the law and prophets, but that he did reveal the
   fulfilling of that doctrine which they themselves did confess, and were
   persuaded to have been delivered by God. Whereupon it followeth that
   they cannot refuse that which he offereth them, but they shall break
   the covenant made with the fathers by God, so much as in them shall
   lie; secondly, he commandeth the faithfulness of God, because it doth
   now in very deed appear that there was nothing promised in times past
   unadvisedly or in vain; but he doth chiefly extol the greatness of the
   grace given at length in Christ. For we must note the comparison
   between them and the fathers, when he saith, that they had gotten that
   which was promised to the fathers. For the more liberally the grace of
   God is poured out upon them, the more filthy shall their unthankfulness
   be, if they shall despise or loathe that inestimable good thing. For
   what else were this, but to cast down at their feet a treasure even
   reached out to them, that they might take hold thereof, and so
   consequently laid in their lap, the hope whereof was reverently
   embraced by the fathers, when it was showed them afar off, and which
   they did foster [811] during their whole life.

   But some man may ask this question concerning those who lived under the
   law, whether even they were not made partakers of the promises? I
   answer, that there is such a society of the same grace among us which
   doth not hinder the long distance. But this was Paul's meaning, that
   their faith stood, as it were, in doubt until Christ appeared, in whom
   all the promises of God are yea and amen; as he teacheth, (2
   Corinthians 1:19, 20.) Therefore we be the heirs of the same kingdom of
   heaven, and partakers of the same spiritual good things, which God
   bestoweth upon his children; also, God gave to them some taste of his
   love in this life, as we taste him now. But Christ, who is the
   substance of all good things and of eternal life, was only promised to
   them, but he is given to us; and they desired him, as being far off; we
   enjoy him, being present.

   33. To their children, namely, to us. It is certain that Paul speaketh
   of natural children, who had their beginning of the holy fathers, which
   we must therefore note, because certain brain-sick men, drawing all
   things unto allegories, dream that there is no respect to be had in
   this place of kindred, but only of faith. And with such an invention
   they make the holy covenant of God of none effect, where it is said,

   "I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed,"
   (Genesis 17:7.)

   It is faith (say they) alone which maketh us the children of Abraham.
   But I say, on the other side, that even those who are born the children
   of Abraham according to the flesh, are also counted the spiritual
   children of God, unless they grow out of kind through unbelief [812]
   For the boughs be naturally holy, because they spring from a holy root,
   until they become profane through their own fault, (Romans 11:16.) And
   assuredly it is Paul's drift to allure the Jews unto Christ; and that
   he may do this, they must be distinguished from the common sort by some
   privilege. And yet it followeth not thereupon (which these knaves do
   odiously object) that the grace of God is tied to the carnal seed;
   because, though the promise of life came by inheritance to the
   posterity of Abraham, yet many were deprived by their unbelief.
   Therefore faith is the cause, that of a great multitude only a few are
   counted children. And that is the double election whereof I spake
   before. The one common to the whole nation alike; because the first
   adoption of God containeth the whole family of Abraham. The other,
   which is restrained unto the secret counsel of God, and is at length
   established by faith, that it may be confirmed to men.

   Therefore Paul doth well and truly affirm that that was performed to
   the Jews which God had promised to the fathers. For it was promised to
   them also, as Zacharias saith in his song, "The oath which he sware to
   our father Abraham, that he would give himself for us," etc. And yet
   the worthiness of that nation doth not hinder but that the grace of
   Christ may also spread itself throughout the whole world; because the
   first-begotten hath the first degree of honor, so that he doth,
   notwithstanding, leave the second place to his brethren. For in that
   after the old people were cast off, the possession of the church was
   left empty for strangers, it began to be a new occasion of gathering
   the Church of the Gentiles; but and if that people had stood in the
   faith, the Gentiles had been joined into the common society of honor.

   After that he had raised Christ. The word raised, in my judgment
   reacheth farther than it doth where it is shortly after repeated. For
   he doth not only say that Christ rose from the dead, but that he was
   appointed of God, and, as it were, brought to light by the hand of God,
   that he might fulfill the office of the Messiah, as the Scripture
   teacheth everywhere that kings and prophets are raised up. [813] For
   the word anastesai is sometimes taken in this sense: And this reason
   moveth me thus to think, because God, by sending his Son into the
   world, did fulfill his promise made to his servants in times past, by
   the effect itself.

   Likeas, in the second Psalm. Though the Greek books, [814] agree in the
   number, yet we must not pass over that which Erasmus saith, that many
   of the old writers read the first Psalm. And it may be that Luke wrote
   so; for that which at this day is counted the second Psalm, might have
   been called the first not without reason, seeing that it is likely that
   the first Psalm was added instead of a proem by the scribes and
   priests, by whose industry the Psalms were gathered into one body. For
   the name of the author is not set to it, and it doth only exhort to
   meditate upon the law of God. But there is no great weight in that
   matter. [815] For this is the chiefest thing, that we know how properly
   and how well Paul applieth the testimony taken out of the Psalm unto
   the matter which he hath in hand. We do not deny that David, when he
   saw that he was on every side assailed by his enemies, and that they
   were of greater power and might than that he was able to resist them,
   doth set against them God's aid, who he knew was the author of his
   kingdom and reign. But forasmuch as he was a figure of the true
   Messiah, we know that those things were shadowed in his person, which
   do appertain, wholly and perfectly to the Messiah alone. And the text
   itself doth prove sufficiently that there is not only a simple and bare
   thanksgiving contained there, agreeable to David's kingdom, but it is a
   higher prophecy. For it is well known that David did in his life scarce
   taste of the hundredth part of the glory which is spoken of in this
   place, concerning which we have spoken more at large, chapter 4.

   Now let us look higher into the words: Kings are indeed called sons of
   God, (Psalm 82:6.) But seeing that God doth intend to prefer David
   before all other kings, and to exempt him out of the number of them,
   this title of honor is given to him principally above all other; not
   because so great honor resteth in his person, because by this means he
   should pass [816] the angels, as it is in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
   1st chapter. Therefore he is thus gorgeously set out in respect of
   Christ, whose image he was, that God doth not take him for one of the
   common sort, or for some one of a great multitude, but he doth, as it
   were, acknowledge him to be his only begotten Son. The proof followeth,
   because God did beget him when he established the kingdom in his hand.
   For that was not done by man's industry, but God showed from heaven the
   invincible power of his hand, whereby it might plainly appear that he
   reigned according to God's counsel. Therefore this begetting, by him
   mentioned, must be referred unto the understanding of knowledge of men;
   to wit, because it was then openly known that he was begotten of God,
   when as he was set upon the throne of the kingdom wonderfully, contrary
   to the hope of all men, and did, by the heavenly power of the Spirit,
   break infinite conspiracies; because he could not reign until he had
   brought all nations round about him in subjection, as if a certain
   world were subdued.

   Now, let us come unto Christ. He came not into the world without
   testimony, whereby he did prove that he was the Son of God. For his
   glory did appear as became the only begotten Son of God, as it is
   written, John 1:14, and he saith everywhere that he hath God for the
   witness and maintainer of this honor. Therefore God begat Christ, when
   he gave him certain marks, whereby he might be known to be his true and
   lively image and Son. And yet this doth not let but that Christ is the
   Wisdom begotten of the Eternal Father before time. But that is the
   secret generation; and now David declareth that it was revealed to men;
   so that the relation is, as we have said, unto men and not unto God;
   because that which was hidden in the heart of God was make known to
   men. And it is a very fine figure, because Christ's divinity was no
   less declared and established, than if he had been begotten of God
   before the eyes of men. I know that Augustine's deep sight [817] doth
   please some, that by today is meant perpetuity. But when as the Spirit
   of God himself is his own interpreter, and whereas he doth expound that
   by the mouth of Paul which he had said by David, we must not invent any
   other sense. And forasmuch (as the same Paul doth witness) that Christ
   was declared to be the Son of God in power when he rose from the dead,
   (Romans 1:4,) we gather that this was the principal token of celestial
   excellency, and that the Father did then bring him truly to light, that
   the world might know that he was begotten of him. Therefore, though God
   began to raise Christ when he came into the world, yet his raising was
   then, as it were, perfect and full; because whereas he was humbled
   before, having taken, as it were, the form of a servant, (Philippians
   2:7,) he did then appear to be the conqueror of death and the Lord of
   life; so that he wanted nothing of that majesty which was meet for the
   Son of God, and that for the only begotten Son.

   34. That he should not return. He addeth now the other member, that
   Christ was once raised from death that he may live for ever, as Paul
   teacheth, Romans 6:10,

   "He dieth no more, neither shall death have dominion over him any more;
   because he liveth to God."

   For the hope conceived of Christ's resurrection should be slender and
   cold, if he were yet subject to destruction, or to any change.
   Therefore he is said to be entered into the kingdom of God, that he may
   also give to his [people] eternal felicity, living for ever. For
   because Christ rose rather for our sake than for himself, the
   perpetuity of life which the Father hath given him reacheth unto us
   all, and is ours. Notwithstanding the place of Isaiah which is here
   cited, seemeth to make but a little for proof of Christ's immortality,
   I will give you the holy things of David, (Isaiah 55:3.) But it is not
   so. For seeing Isaiah speaketh of the redemption promised to David, and
   affirmeth that the same shall be firm and stable, we do well gather by
   this the immortal kingdom of Christ, wherein the eternity of salvation
   is grounded. And Paul followed the Greek interpreters when he put holy
   things for mercies. Chessed, which signifieth meek, merciful, and
   gentle, is wont by the Grecians to be translated holy. Therefore they
   translated hsdy of David, the holy things of David, whereas the prophet
   meaneth rather the grace promised to David. But Paul granted this to
   the ignorant and weak, who were better acquainted with the Greek
   reading, especially forasmuch as the force of the testimony consisteth
   in another point. For this is Paul's meaning in sum, If the grace be
   eternal which God saith he will give in his Son, the life of his Son
   must be eternal, and not subject to corruption. [818] For we must hold
   this rule, that all the promises of God are in Christ yea and amen, (2
   Corinthians 1:20;) and that therefore they cannot be of any force
   unless he do quicken them.

   35. Thou shalt not suffer thy Holy One. This place was likewise cited
   by Peter in the first sermon, set down by Luke in the second chapter,
   (Acts 2:27,) where I expounded the same; therefore, let the readers
   repair thither. Only I will touch this briefly, that David putteth two
   Hebrew words for the grave, as he useth repetitions commonly; the
   former whereof is derived of desiring or lusting, because the grave
   devoureth all things as an insatiable gulf; and the other of
   corruption. According to this etymology David's meaning is faithfully
   expressed in Greek; for the quality of the grave is noted, when as it
   receiveth the corpse, and doth, as it were, swallow it up, that it may
   rot there, and may at length perish when it is consumed. Paul affirmeth
   that that belongeth to Christ alone, that he was free and saved from
   corruption; for though his body was laid in the grave, corruption had,
   notwithstanding, no title to it, seeing that it lay there whole, as in
   a bed, until the day of the resurrection.

   36. When David had served his time. Lest any man should think that that
   place intreateth of David, Paul showeth briefly that this agreeth not
   to David in all points, whose corpse was rotten in the grave. Therefore
   it remaineth, that because this was a privilege belonging to Christ
   alone, that David prophesied of him in spirit. Nevertheless, we must
   note the proportion between the members and the head; for as the truth
   of this prophecy was found whole and perfect in Christ alone, as in the
   head, so it taketh place in all the members according to the measure
   and order of every man. And forasmuch as Christ rose to this end, that
   he may fashion and make our base body like to his glorious body,
   (Philippians 3:21;) upon this condition do the godly go down into the
   pit, that rottenness may not [finally] consume their bodies. Therefore,
   according to the hope of the resurrection to come, David saith by good
   right that he shall not see corruption; for that ought not altogether
   to be counted corruption for which there is a better restoring
   prepared; for the bodies of the faithful corrupt to this end, that they
   may put on blessed incorruption in their time. Yet this is no let but
   that the estate of the head and members may be far unlike, and that we
   may follow the Son of God afar off and lazily. [819]

   Now we see that both things are true and fitly said, that David and the
   rest of the faithful, inasmuch as they shall be like to their head,
   shall not see corruption, and yet the Son of God alone shall be free
   from corruption wholly. We must note the phrase, when he saith, that
   David served his age, or the men of his time.

   The old interpreter distinguisheth it otherwise, and certain Greek
   copies agree thereto, to wit, that David served the will of God in his
   time; which reading, though it is to be allowed, [820] yet it doth not
   cause me to mislike the other. For it is neither superfluous nor cold,
   that he slept by the will of God, or the counsel of God; because the
   meaning thereof is, that God, in the death of David, did not forget
   that prophecy; as if he should say that the body of David lay in the
   grave not without the counsel or purpose of God, until it should rise
   again, that the effect of the prophecy might be extended unto Christ.
   If no man mislike that which I say, we are taught hereby to what end
   men live in the world, to wit, that one man may help another. For every
   man doth not live, neither is born, for himself, but mankind is knit
   together with a holy knot. Therefore, unless we be disposed to
   overthrow the laws of nature, let us remember that we must not live for
   ourselves, but for our neighbors.

   But here may a question be asked, whether we ought not also to care for
   our posterity? I answer, that the ministry of the godly is also
   profitable for the posterity, as we see that David, being dead, doth
   profit us more at this day than a great part of those which live with
   us; but Paul meaneth simply, that the faithful during their whole life
   employ themselves and their offices to help their neighbors, and that
   death is unto them as a goal, because they have made an end then, when
   the Lord calleth them out of the world. The sum is, that we must have
   respect first to our time, that we may serve our brethren, with whom
   and among whom we lead our life; and, secondly, we must do our endeavor
   that the fruit of our ministry may redound unto our posterity. Seeing
   that God prescribeth his servants this law, their rashness cannot be
   excused who feign that the dead pray for us, and that they do no less
   serve the Church than whilst they lived.

   By the counsel of God he fell on sleep. Paul might have said simply
   that David died; he addeth by the counsel of God, that we may know that
   that was not fulfilled in the person of the prophet which is read in
   the Psalm. Notwithstanding, we are taught that the bond of life and
   death is in like sort appointed for us by God, as it is Psalm 90:3,

   "Thou sendest out men, and makest them to pass over; again thou sayest,
   Come again, ye children of men."

   Yea, Plato setteth down this very eloquently, that it is meet that men
   pass out of the world not without the leave and pleasure of God, by
   whose hand they are placed there as a standing for a time. [821] And
   for this cause, when he speaketh of David's death, he maketh mention of
   the counsel of God, that we may know that corruption did not happen to
   him by chance, as if God had forgotten his promise; but that it came to
   pass by God's providence, that the faithful might know that the
   prophecy was to be referred unto another. To sleep, and to be laid unto
   the fathers, are forms of speech so well known and so common, that they
   need no exposition.

   Acts 13:38-42

   38. Therefore, be it known unto you, [822] that through him remission
   of sins is promised to you: 39. And from all things, from which ye
   could not be justified in the law of Moses. 40. Whosoever believeth in
   this man is justified. 41. Therefore, take heed, lest that befall you
   which is said in the prophets; 42. Behold, ye despisers, and wonder,
   and vanish away; because I do a work in your days, a work which ye
   shall not believe, if a man tell it you.


   38. Therefore, be it known unto you. After that he hath declared the
   mean whereby salvation is purchased through Christ, he doth now intreat
   of his office and power. And this is the principal point, to know what
   good things we have by the coming of Christ, and what we are to hope
   for at his hands. And although Luke setteth down in a word that Paul
   preached of the benefits of Christ, yet there is no cause why any man
   should doubt but that so great matters were handled weightily, and only
   according as their dignity did require. By this word, Be it known unto
   you, Paul meaneth that nothing should hinder them from knowing such an
   excellent and plain matter, save only sloth; and that, therefore, it
   was an absurd thing that those benefits of God should be hidden from
   the faithful which were offered by Christ. For he was sent with the
   shrill preaching of the gospel, which our faith ought to hear, that it
   may enter into the sure possession of his good things; for we must know
   what he is, that we may enjoy him truly. Forgiveness of sins is set
   first, whereby God doth reconcile us unto himself. That which God will
   have preached to all his people doth he show to be necessary for all
   men; for Paul speaketh not to one or two, but to all the Jews which
   were at Antioch.

   Therefore, we must first mark that we be all enemies to God through
   sin, (Colossians 2:13.) Whereupon it followeth that we are all excluded
   from the kingdom of God, and are given over to eternal death, until God
   receive us to favor by the free forgiveness of sins. We must also note
   this, that God doth pardon to us our sins, and that he is reconciled
   through the Mediator, because like as without him there is no
   satisfaction, so neither is there any pardon or forgiveness of
   guiltiness. These be principles of our faith which are not learned in
   the schools of the philosophers, that all mankind is condemned and
   drowned in sin, that there is in us no righteousness which is able to
   reconcile us to God; that the only hope of salvation resteth in his
   mercy, whilst that he doth freely forgive us; and that those remain
   under the guilt which fly not unto Christ, and seek not forgiveness
   [823] in his death.

   And from all things. He doth secretly prevent that which might seem
   contrary to the former doctrine. For look how many ceremonies of the
   law there were, so many exercises were there to obtain remission of
   sins. Therefore, the Jews might readily object, If he alone do
   reconcile God to us, our sins being done away, to what end serve so
   many washings and sacrifices, which we have hitherto used according to
   the prescript of the law? Therefore, lest the ceremonies of the law
   hinder the Jews, Paul teacheth that Christ doth that which they were
   not able to do. Not that Paul spake so briefly and compendiously, (for
   he did not hope that the Jews would at the first come unto Christ,
   casting from them suddenly the affiance which they had in the
   righteousness of the law;) but it was sufficient for Luke briefly to
   collect [824] the sum of those things which he then taught in just and
   due order. His meaning is, that the Mediator took away that let from
   the Jews wherein they did stick. The ceremonial law ought indeed to
   have been a schoolmaster to lead them by the hand unto Christ; all
   rites commanded by God were helps to help and further their faith; but
   as men use preposterously to corrupt the holy ordinances of God, they
   stop the way before themselves by their ceremonies, and they shut the
   gate of faith, that they could not come to Christ. They thought they
   had righteousness in sacrifices; that by washings was gotten true
   cleanness; that God was pleased with them so soon as they had ended
   their external pomp: in sum, forsaking the body, they laid hold upon
   vain shadows. God did indeed appoint no unprofitable or vain thing in
   the law; wherefore ceremonies were sure and undoubted testimonies of
   remission of sins. For God did not lie in these words, Let the sinner
   do sacrifice, and his iniquity shall be purged. But as Christ was the
   end of the law, and the heavenly pattern of the tabernacle, so the
   force and effect of all ceremonies did depend upon him; whereby it is
   proved that they were vain shadows, when he was set aside, (Hebrews
   8:5.) Now we see Paul's drift and purpose; to wit, that he meant to
   draw away the Jews from the false and perverse confidence which they
   reposed in the law; lest being puffed up, they should think that they
   had no need of Christ's help, or lest they should seek only external
   felicity in him.

   Be justified in the law. This place doth plainly show what the word
   justified doth import in all other places where it is used; to wit, to
   be delivered and acquitted. There was mention made of remission of
   sins; Paul affirmeth that there is no other way whereby we can obtain
   the same but the grace of Christ. Lest any man should object that there
   be remedies to be found in the law, he answereth that there was in them
   no force. Therefore the sense is plain, that they cannot be justified
   from sin in the law, because the rites of the law were neither just nor
   lawful prices to remove guiltiness; they were nothing worth of
   themselves to deserve righteousness, neither were they sufficient
   recompenses to appease God. Certainly, it cannot be denied (but
   wickedly) that that justification annexed to remission of sins is, as
   it were, the means and way to obtain the same. For what else doth Paul
   go about but to confirm that saying, that our sins are forgiven us
   through the benefit of Christ, by answering contrary objections? And he
   proveth it, because neither satisfactions, neither all the rites of the
   law, call justify us from sin. Therefore he is justified by Christ, who
   is freely loosed from the guilt and judgment of eternal death to which
   he was subject. This is the righteousness of faith, whilst that God
   counteth us just, by not imputing our sins.

   This only propriety of the word is sufficient to refute the cavils of
   the Papists, who hold that we are not justified by pardon or by free
   accepting, but by habit and infused righteousness. Therefore, let us
   not suffer them to rend in pieces unworthily and wickedly this text of
   Paul, when he saith that they are justified from all things, that we
   may be assured of remission of sins. And now we must know that the law
   of Moses is set against Christ, as the principal mean to obtain
   righteousness, if there had been any besides Christ. Paul disputeth,
   indeed, of ceremonies; but we must note that there was nothing omitted
   in them which might serve to purge sins and to appease God. Yet there
   was not one of all the ceremonies of the law which did not make man
   guilty, as a new handwriting; as Paul teacheth, Colossians 2:14. What
   then? Assuredly God meant to testify that men are justified by the
   death of his Son alone, because he made him sin for us who did [knew]
   no sin, that we might have righteousness in him, (2 Corinthians 5:21.)
   Whereupon it followeth that whatsoever satisfactions are invented by
   men, they tend to rob Christ of his honor. In the law and in Christ
   signify as much as by the law and by Christ, according to the Hebrew
   phrase.

   From all things. By this member is refuted the wicked invention of the
   Papists, who teach that only original sin and actual sins committed
   before baptism are clearly and freely forgiven by Christ, and that
   others are redeemed by satisfactions. But Paul saith plainly that we
   are justified from sins by Christ throughout the whole course of our
   life. For we must remember that the ceremonies [rites] of the law were
   committed to the Jews, that as well the profit as the use thereof might
   flourish daily in the Church; that is, that the Jews might indeed
   understand that their sacrifices and washings were not continually
   reiterated in vain. If the truth and substance of them be found in
   Christ, it followeth that there is no other satisfaction or sacrifice
   to put away sins but his death; otherwise there should be no analogy or
   proportion between this and the old figures. The Papists call us back
   unto repentance and the keys, as if the ceremonies of the law were not
   exercises to think upon repentance, and as if the power of the keys
   were not annexed unto them. But the faith of the godly was holpen by
   such helps, that they might fly unto the grace of the Mediator alone.
   Therefore, let this remain sure and certain that the righteousness
   which we have in Christ is not for one day or a moment, but it is
   everlasting, as the sacrifice of his death doth daily reconcile us to
   God.

   39. Every one that believeth. Paul showeth how men obtain the
   righteousness of Christ; to wit, when they receive it by faith; and
   that which faith doth obtain is not obtained by any merits of works.
   Wherefore, Paul's opinion is plain, that we are justified by faith
   alone, which, notwithstanding the Papists oppugn [oppose] and strive
   against no less obstinately than bitterly, nevertheless, it is
   requisite that we know what the word believe doth import, which is made
   unsavory to the Papists through ignorance. There be also other benefits
   of Christ which we reap by faith; for when he regenerateth us by his
   Spirit, he restoreth in us the image of God; and after that the old man
   is crucified he fashioneth us unto newness of life. But it was enough
   for Luke to express this one thing, how men return into favor with God,
   from whom they be estranged by sin, because we may easily pass thence
   unto the residue.

   40. Take heed that that come not upon you. Because he had to do with
   stiff-necked men, or at least there were diverse in the company which
   were stiff-necked (as if he meant with a hammer to soften their
   stubbornnesses) he addeth a chiding unto doctrine. For if the Jews had
   been obedient and willing to obey, undoubtedly he would have sought
   sweetly to allure them unto Christ. But it was either their
   sluggishness, or else their willfulness, that caused him to be more
   angry; like as all those must be cited to appear before God's
   judgment-seat who contemn the grace of Christ and the horrible judgment
   of eternal death must be denounced to those. He signifieth, indeed,
   that there is yet place left for repentance, when he willeth [825] them
   to take heed; yet, notwithstanding, he telleth them therewithal, that
   unless they beware in time, the horrible vengeance of God is not far
   off.

   Which is said in the prophets. The place which is cited is taken out of
   the first chapter of Habakkuk, (Habakkuk 1:5;) but because all
   prophecies were gathered into one volume or body, Paul saith that it is
   written in the prophets.

   41. And yet he doth not recite word for word the words of Habakkuk,
   which go thus, "Behold, ye Gentiles, and see and wonder, and be
   astonished; because a work shall be done in your days which no man
   shall believe when it shall be told him." Paul saith, "Behold, ye
   despisers," that the Jews may know that the vengeance which was once
   brought upon their fathers is common to the despisers of the word; as
   if he should say, God doth at this day make no less account of his
   word, the contempt whereof he did once punish so sharply. Therefore,
   the prophet's denunciation doth appertain unto all ages, so that the
   despisers cannot hope that they can escape that vengeance now whereof
   others have tasted. They boasted of the temple; they vaunted that they
   were the people of God; being puffed up with wicked pride, they
   despised all threatenings. Therefore Paul putteth them in mind of that
   which God by his prophets doth threaten to the despisers.

   A work in your days. The sense is, Those who refuse to believe the word
   of God shall feel his hand, that being at length with plagues
   convicted, they may know that he spake in earnest. It is a common
   proverb, that experience is the mistress of fools. So the Lord doth
   indeed punish the wicked, [826] that being tamed with miseries, they
   may begin to confess his power. And what manner [of] punishment doth he
   denounce? Because you (saith he) do not believe my word, I will show an
   example among you which no man will believe; by which words he meaneth,
   that he will punish them, so that the world shall be afraid to see it.
   For as rebellion against God is a detestable monster, so it is no
   marvel if of itself it beget monsters of punishments. Therefore, we
   must beware, lest, if we cease to give credence to God's word, we feel
   his hand more mighty than all our senses do comprehend, and even unto
   the astonying [astonishment] of all the whole world; and lest even we
   be made astounded through fear. Habakkuk prophesieth of the destruction
   brought upon them by the Chaldeans; but the punishment whereby God
   revenged the contempt of his gospel was more cruel, [severe.]
   Therefore, let us accustom ourselves to fear God and reverently embrace
   his word, lest some such things befall us.

   Acts 13:42-45

   42. And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
   exhorted them that they would speak to them words between the Sabbaths.
   [827] 43. And when the synagogue was dissolved, many of the Jews and
   religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, talking with
   them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. 44. And when the
   Sabbath was come, almost the whole city was gathered to hear the word
   of God. 45. And when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
   indignation, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,
   contrarying [contradicting] them, and blaspheming them.


   42. When they were gone out of the synagogue. It may be also read, out
   of the synagogue of the Jews, and peradventure more fitly. For it is
   likely that they were gone out before the multitude was dispersed; and
   that is gathered out of the text because Luke saith shortly after, that
   when the synagogue was dissolved certain of the Jews did follow Paul
   and Barnabas. Therefore, the sense is, that Paul and Barnabas went out
   whilst the Jews were yet assembled, and that they were then requested
   by the Gentiles to take some pains with them in the mean season.

   43. And that afterward there came certain of the Jews and proselytes to
   Paul, being both desirous to learn, and also that they might make
   profession of their faith. When as the old interpreter and Erasmus did
   translate it the Sabbath following, they did not understand Luke's
   meaning. For seeing that he intreateth in this place of the Gentiles, I
   do not think that they choose a Sabbath wherein they may hear Paul and
   Barnabas. For that day was appointed for the Jews, but the Gentiles had
   no less opportunity upon other days. Therefore, to what end should they
   defer their desire and prayers until the eighth day? Yea, rather they
   covet to hear Paul whilst he is at leisure, and is not occupied in
   teaching the Jews. So that the Lord doth not suffer them to be idle
   until the Sabbath come, offering unto them matter in the Gentiles,
   wherein they may exercise themselves.

   42 They would speak words. I have translated it as it is in Luke,
   though the article ta may be taken for ta auta, as in some other
   places. Then the sense should be, that they were requested that they
   would that week intreat of the same things before the Gentiles.
   Furthermore, whilst that the Gentiles do snatch greedily at every first
   opportunity, the Jews being quiet, [828] do neglect that which is set
   before them; only that certain of them join themselves to Paul and
   Barnabas. Luke expresseth the proselytes by name, who seeing they had
   embraced the doctrine of the law, and did worship the God of Israel,
   were not puffed up with that pride which hindered the Jews, who made
   boast of their long stock and race.

   43. Who speaking. The sense is doubtful. For it may be referred unto
   the Jews and proselytes, that they exhorted Paul and Barnabas that they
   should not faint, but stand stoutly in the grace of God. Neither did
   they want occasion; for they saw combats prepared for them; and that
   therefore they had need of invincible constancy to suffer and abide the
   brunts of the contrary faction. Wherefore that might very well agree,
   that being inflamed with a desire to go forward, they sought to
   encourage Paul and Barnabas to hold on. If you refer it unto Paul and
   Barnabas, the sense shall be this, that they did not reject those which
   came, but they entertained them courteously and gently, and confirmed
   and strengthened them, that they might persist in the grace which they
   had received. And this word grace doth first comprehend the faith of
   the gospel; secondly, those good things which come thence to us; or,
   that I may speak more briefly, the calling into the hope of eternal
   salvation.

   44. And when the Sabbath came. The great assembly of the people doth
   prove that Paul and Barnabas loitered not between the Sabbaths, and
   they did not take pains with the Gentiles in vain; for the studies and
   desires of the people had been so prepared, that they all desired to
   know the whole matter more surely, which they did hope would be, if it
   should be discussed among the Jews. For we may guess that though they
   were allured with some sweet taste, yet were they not as yet thoroughly
   persuaded to receive the doctrine of the gospel without doubting, [829]
   but that they came into the synagogue in a quandary, [830] between hope
   and desire.

   45. They were filled. It is no new matter for the rage of the wicked to
   be inflamed when the light of the gospel is set somewhat nearer;
   especially when they see the increase of sound doctrine, they break out
   with greater violence to resist. And it is to be doubted whether Luke
   do mean, by the word zeal, that they were moved with a certain wicked
   indignation, to set themselves against Paul and Barnabas, as ambition
   is the mother as well of envy as of all contention; or he take zeal for
   indignation conceived thereupon, because they did lament that the
   Gentiles were made equal with the people of God. For they counted this
   a very unmeet thing, that the holy treasure of doctrine, which was the
   proper inheritance of the children, should he, as it were, at all men's
   feet.

   Gainsaying and blaspheming. They were so sore set upon resisting, that
   they brake out at length into blasphemy. And Satan doth for the most
   part drive the wicked unto such madness, that when they be overcome
   with reasons and discouraged, they wax harder and harder; and wittingly
   and willingly they spew out at length blasphemies against God and the
   truth. Wherefore we must take so much the more heed when as the truth
   of God is plainly set before us, lest, if we be carried away with a
   desire to speak against it, we fall straightway into that steep down.

   Acts 13:46-52

   46. And when Paul and Barnabas had taken liberty, [or boldness,] they
   said, It was necessary that we should. first preach the word of God to
   you. And after that ye reject it, and do not judge yourselves worthy of
   eternal life, behold, we turn unto the Gentiles. 47. For thus hath the
   Lord commanded us: I have made thee a light of the Gentiles, that thou
   mayest be the salvation unto the end of the earth. 48. And when the
   Gentiles heard, they rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord; and
   they believed, as many as were ordained unto eternal life. 49. And the
   word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout the whole region. 50. And
   the Jews stirred certain religious and honest women, and the chief men
   of the city, and they raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and
   expelled them out of their coasts. 51. And they shaked up the dust of
   their feet against them, and came to Iconium. 52. And the disciples
   were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.


   46. When they had taken liberty. Luke showeth that the servants of
   Christ were so far from being discouraged with the stubbornness of the
   enemies, that they began, therefore, to inveigh against them afresh
   more freely. For though they had sharply pricked them, yet they did yet
   spare them a little; but now, when they see Christ obstinately rejected
   by them, they [832] excommunicate them and deprive them of the kingdom
   of God. And by this example are we taught that we must not use extreme
   severity, save only against those who are quite past hope. And the more
   bold the reprobate are to oppress the truth, the more courage ought we
   to take to ourselves. For the servants of God must be armed with
   invincible constancy of the Spirit, that they may never give place to
   the devil, nor to his ministers; as the Lord commandeth Jeremiah to
   encounter with the reprobate with a face of iron.

   It was necessary. He accuseth them of unthankfulness, because, whereas
   they were chosen by God out of all people, that Christ might offer
   himself unto them, they refuse so great a benefit maliciously. And in
   the former member he setteth down the degree of honor and excellency
   whereunto God had exalted them; afterward followeth the upbraiding,
   because they do willingly cast from them so great grace; whereupon he
   concludeth that it is now time that the gospel be translated unto the
   Gentiles. In that he saith, that it was meet that it should first be
   preached to them, it doth properly appertain unto the time of Christ's
   kingdom. For under the law, before Christ was given, the Jews were not
   only the first, but alone. Therefore was it that Moses called them a
   priestly kingdom, and the peculiar people of God, (Exodus 19:5, 6.) But
   the adoption of God rested then with them alone upon this condition,
   (the Gentiles being omitted,) that they should be preferred as yet
   before the Gentiles by the coming of Christ. For though Christ
   reconciled the world to his Father, yet they were former in order, who
   were already near unto God, and of his family. Therefore, that was the
   most lawful order, that the apostles should gather the Church first of
   the Jews, afterward of the Gentiles, as we saw in the first chapter,
   (Acts 1:18,) and in other places, so that the fellowship of the
   Gentiles did not take from the Jews the right of the first-begotten,
   but that they were always the chief in the Church of God. In this
   respect Paul saith, that the righteousness of God is made manifest in
   the gospel, first to the Jews, then to the Grecians, (Romans 1:16.)
   Such greatness of grace which God vouchsafed to bestow upon them, doth
   exaggerate and increase the greatness of their sin, whilst that they
   reject that which is so mercifully offered unto them. Therefore he
   addeth that they give judgment of themselves, that they are unworthy of
   eternal life. For seeing that the rejecting of the gospel is the denial
   of the righteousness of God, we need no other judge to condemn the
   unbelievers.

   And after that ye reject. Paul seemeth to reason unfitly. For, first it
   was not of necessity that the Jews should be excluded, that the
   Gentiles might be admitted unto the hope of salvation; secondly, this
   was more convenient, that, after the Jews had embraced the gospel, they
   should grant the second place to the Gentiles. And Paul speaketh in
   like sort as if they could not grow together into one body, and as if
   the gospel could not come unto the Gentiles unless it were rejected of
   the Jews. And now was he not ordained to be the apostle of the Gentiles
   before he found such stubbornness in the Jews? [833] I answer, that
   there is great force in the words we are turned For his meaning is,
   that he is now turned away from the Jews, that he may addict and give
   over himself wholly to the Gentiles. If they had remained in their
   degree such turning had not followed, but he should have drawn the
   Gentiles also with a continual course, after that the Jews were
   received into the bosom; and he should have embraced them both
   together, know, forasmuch as the Jews turn their backs, and withdraw
   themselves from his ministry, he cannot look upon them and the Gentiles
   both at once. Therefore, taking his leave of them, he is enforced to
   translate his care unto the Gentiles. Therefore, unless the Jews had
   estranged themselves from the Church, the calling of the Gentiles
   should have been such as is by the prophets described: "In that day
   shall seven strangers take hold of the cloak of a man that is a Jew,
   and shall say, we will walk with you; because God is with you." But now
   the Gentiles are called after a new and accidental manner; because,
   when the Jews were rejected, they entered into the empty possession.
   They ought to have been gathered unto the Jews; but after that they
   fell away, and were driven out, they came in their place. So that their
   death was the life of the Gentiles, and the natural branches being cut
   off, the wild olives were ingrafted into the holy root, until God do at
   length restore them also unto life, being ingrafted into their former
   root, that the Israel of God being gathered together from all quarters
   may be saved.

   47. As he hath commanded. The place is taken out of Isaiah, where,
   notwithstanding, God doth rather speak unto his Son than unto the
   apostles. But we must note, that many things which the Scripture
   attributeth to Christ do appertain unto his ministers. I say many
   things; not all things: for there be certain titles proper to the
   person of Christ, wherewith to adorn the ministers were wicked
   sacrilege. Christ is called our Righteousness, because he was the only
   purging sacrifice, [834] and hath reconciled the Father to us by his
   death, and did rise again afterward, that, having overcome death, he
   might purchase for us eternal life. Therefore the whole substance of
   our salvation is in Christ's person; but inasmuch as he worketh by his
   ministers, by resigning to them his office, he doth also impart with
   [to] them his titles. Of this sort is the preaching of the gospel. He
   alone was appointed by the Father to be our teacher; but he hath put in
   his place pastors and doctors, who speak, as it were, out of his mouth.
   So that the authority remaineth wholly to him, and he is nevertheless
   heard in his ministers. Therefore Paul doth fitly apply unto himself
   the testimony of Isaiah, where he intreateth of the preaching of the
   gospel.

   I have made thee a light. It should seem that he speaketh in that place
   of such a calling of the Gentiles as doth not carry with it the casting
   off of the old people. For God doth rather associate strangers unto the
   Jews, who were before of the household. It is but a small matter, saith
   he, that thou be my minister in teaching Israel, because I have made
   thee a light to the Gentiles. God doth seem to begin his Church among
   the children of Abraham, and, that done, to reach out his hand to the
   Gentiles, that they may both make one Church by one consent of faith.
   But Paul doth in such sort cite the prophecy, as if it could not be
   fulfilled unless the Jews had been cast off. For he signifieth that the
   light of Christ was lighted to the Gentiles, after that they were cast
   into the darkness of death. I answer, that this cannot be necessarily
   proved out of the text, that Paul doth affirm that the Gentiles could
   not have been illuminated before the light of the Jews had been put
   out. For this may be the sense, Forasmuch as you have deprived
   yourselves of eternal life, there is no cause why ye should think that
   the grace of God is profaned, if, leaving you, we take care and charge
   of the Gentiles; for the Messiah is not given to you alone, but he is
   appointed to be the Savior of the whole world; as it is written, "I
   have made thee," etc.; although, if you weigh the place of the prophet
   more thoroughly, you shall find the casting off of the old people
   included therein. For God pronounceth that he will be glorious and
   renowned in the ministry of Christ, though Israel be not gathered
   together. He addeth afterward, by way of exposition, that the power of
   Christ shall not be restrained unto one people only, because his light
   shall shed abroad his beams unto the farthest parts of the world unto
   salvation. It seemeth that Paul noteth this occasion of calling the
   Gentiles, namely, because, seeing he found no matter to exercise
   himself in among the Jews, he gave himself wholly to the Gentiles. We
   must note this by the way, in the words of the prophet, that salvation
   is put after light, according to that saying of Christ,

   "This is eternal life, to know thee, the true God," etc.
   (John 17:3.)

   For if the knowledge of God alone bring to us salvation, it is likewise
   the only resurrection from destruction of eternal death, for us to be
   illuminated into the faith of Christ, after that we be delivered from
   the darkness of ignorance.

   48. And when the Gentiles heard. The matter of the Gentiles' joy was
   this, [viz.] when they heard that they were not called to salvation at
   a sudden, as if this had not been decreed before by God, but that that
   is now at length fulfilled which was foretold many years before. For
   doubtless it was small confirmation of their faith, because salvation
   was promised to them by the coming of Christ, whereby it did also come
   to pass that they did with more earnest desire and reverence embrace
   the gospel. To glorify the word of God may be expounded two manner of
   ways, either that they did confess that it was true which was
   prophesied by Isaiah, or that they embraced the doctrine which was set
   before them with faith. Assuredly there is a full subscription noted
   out, because they dispute or doubt no longer, so soon as they saw that
   Paul had gotten the victory. And surely we do then honor the word of
   God as we ought, when we submit ourselves obediently to it by faith; as
   it cannot be more grievously blasphemed than when men refuse to believe
   it. And here we see how the Gentiles were not hindered, by that
   stubbornness which they saw in the Jews, from giving their name to
   Christ. With like courage [835] must we despise and tread under foot
   the pride of the wicked, when, by their obstinacy, they study to stop
   the way before us.

   And they believed. This is an exposition of the member next going
   before, at least in my judgment.: For Luke showeth what manner [of]
   glory they gave to the word of God. And here we must note the
   restraint, [reservation,] when he saith that they believed, (but) not
   all in general, but those who were ordained unto life. And we need not
   doubt but that Luke calleth those tetagmenous, who were chosen by the
   free adoption of God. For it is a ridiculous cavil to refer this unto
   the affection of those which believed, as if those received the gospel
   whose minds were well-disposed. For this ordaining must be understood
   of the eternal counsel of God alone. Neither doth Luke say that they
   were ordained unto faith, but unto life; because the Lord doth
   predestinate his unto the inheritance of eternal life. And this place
   teacheth that faith dependeth upon God's election. And assuredly,
   seeing that the whole race of mankind is blind and stubborn, those
   diseases stick fast in our nature until they be redressed by the grace
   of the Spirit, and that redressing floweth from the fountain of
   election alone. For in that of two which hear the same doctrine
   together, [836] the one showeth himself apt to be taught, the other
   continueth in his obstinacy. It is not, therefore, because they differ
   by nature, but because God doth lighten [illumine] the former, and doth
   not vouchsafe the other the like grace. We are, indeed, made the
   children of God by faith; as faith, as touching us, is the gate and the
   first beginning of salvation; but there is a higher respect of God. For
   he doth not begin to choose us after that we believe; but he sealeth
   his adoption, which was hidden in our hearts, by the gift of faith,
   that it may be manifest and sure. For if this be proper to the children
   of God alone to be his disciples, it followeth that it doth not
   appertain unto all the children of Adam in general. No marvel,
   therefore, if all do not receive the gospel; [837] because, though our
   heavenly Father inviteth all men unto the faith by the external voice
   of man, yet doth he not call effectually by his Spirit any save those
   whom he hath determined to save. Now, if God's election, whereby he
   ordaineth us unto life, be the cause of faith and salvation, there
   remaineth nothing for worthiness or merits.

   Therefore, let us hold and mark that which Luke saith, that those were
   ordained before unto life, who, being in-grafted into the body of
   Christ by faith, do receive the earnest and pledge of their adoption in
   Christ. Whence we do also gather what force the preaching of the gospel
   hath of itself. For it doth not find faith in men, save only because
   God doth call those inwardly whom he hath chosen, and because he
   draweth those who were his own before unto Christ, (John 6:37.) Also
   Luke teacheth in the same words, that it cannot be that any of the
   elect should perish. For he saith not that one or a few of the elect
   did believe, but so many as were elect. For though God's election [838]
   be unknown to us until we perceive it by faith, yet is it not doubtful
   or in suspense in his secret counsel; because he commendeth all those
   whom he counteth his to the safeguard and tuition of his Son, who will
   continue a faithful keeper even unto the end. Both members are
   necessary to be known. When election is placed above faith, there is no
   cause why men should challenge to themselves any thing in any part of
   their salvation. For if faith, wherein consisteth salvation, which is
   unto us a witness of the free adoption of God, which coupleth us to
   Christ, and maketh his life ours, whereby we possess God with his
   righteousness, and, finally, whereby we receive the grace of
   sanctification, be grounded without us in the eternal counsel of God;
   what good things so ever we have, we must needs acknowledge that we
   have received it of the grace of God, which doth prevent us of its own
   accord. Again, because many entangle themselves in doubtful and thorny
   imaginations, whilst that they seek for their salvation in the hidden
   counsel of God, let us learn that the election of God is therefore
   approved by faith, that our minds may be turned unto Christ as unto the
   pledge of election, and that they may seek no other certainty save that
   which is revealed to us in the gospel; I say, let this seal suffice us,
   that

   "whosoever believeth in the only-begotten Son of God hath eternal
   life,"
   (John 3:36.)

   49. The word of the Lord was spread abroad. Luke doth in this place
   declare the proceeding [839] of the gospel; wherein appeareth how true
   the parable of Christ is, when he saith that it is like to leaven,
   (Luke 13:21.) We heard before that there was great concourse of people,
   so that the seed of true doctrine was sown throughout the whole city.
   Luke saith now that it was spread farther, to wit, throughout the whole
   country.

   50. Nevertheless, he declareth that that was done not without great
   pains and trouble. Therefore, the beginning of the calling of the
   Gentiles was joyful and prosperous, neither could Satan hinder the
   course of the grace of God; but in the mean season, it stood Paul and
   Barnabas upon (whom God had brought forth into the field [840] ) to
   strive. And we must mark what Luke saith, that the religious and honest
   women, together with the chief men of the city, were enforced to
   persecute the servants of Christ. For this was no small offense to the
   rude, and those who were as yet scarce begotten in Christ, when they
   saw all those men and women which were of any account or estimation set
   against Christ, and also whatsoever was praise-worthy according to men.
   A great multitude of men received Christ, but it was but the multitude
   and the offscourings of men. Against them were set the chief men of the
   city, who with their pomp did easily oppress the base and obscure
   multitude. That might also cause doctrine to be suspected, yea, to be
   hated, in that godly and honest matrons to look to were enemies to it.
   If wicked, ungodly, and mischievous men should have issued out of their
   taverns and dens; if companies of whores should break out of their
   brothel-house, it should be no reproach to the gospel; yea, rather the
   dignity thereof should thereby appear more plainly; but now, what may
   the weak think with themselves, but that the doctrine which hath such
   adversaries is not of God? Therefore it was expedient that not only the
   faithful, who were as yet weak, should be confirmed by the Lord, lest
   their faith should fall, but also that the hand should be reached out
   to Paul and Barnabas, lest, being discouraged, they should leave off.

   And by this example the Lord meant to teach us that we must valiantly
   resist such lets; [841] and that we must beware lest the vain visors of
   virtue [842] do blind our eyes, so that we cannot see the glory of
   Christ which shineth in the gospel. For it is certain that all that
   virtue and honesty which is in men is mere hypocrisy where they set
   themselves against. Christ; though it may be that those who are rashly
   carried against Christ for a time may afterwards repent.
   Notwithstanding, we must thus think with ourselves, that whatsoever
   fair show of holiness those bear who resist the gospel, they are
   neither endued with the perfect fear of God, neither are they any thing
   else but a vain shadow, how greatly soever they boast of their virtue.
   Neither is it without cause that Christ hath this title given him, that
   he revealeth the cogitations of many hearts, (Luke 2:35.)

   Religious. And what manner [of] religion could that be where there was
   no reverence of the Word of God? We must note that there be four kinds
   of men: as there be few which worship God sincerely and from the heart,
   so there be few who openly profess the manifest and gross contempt of
   him. These be two sorts. And the more part is neither quite without
   religion, neither is it altogether void of the common worship of God;
   but yet, notwithstanding, whilst they do coldly, and, as it were,
   overfields [843] play with God, if they be thoroughly examined they be
   but profane; like as, at this day, the ungodliness of many is after a
   sort shrouded under ceremonies, and the reigned profession of the
   worship of God. So that in all ages there have been certain worshippers
   of God who have worshipped him like stage-players, [844] whose holiness
   did wholly consist in gestures and vain pomps. In Paul's time, even as
   at this day, a peculiar study of godliness was to be found in a few,
   whose religion, though it were impure, and their heart reigned,
   deceitful, and double, yet are they counted after a sort religious, in
   respect of their zeal. But hereby appeareth what account we may make of
   bare religion, which driveth headlong, through unadvised heat, the
   professors thereof, to resist the kingdom of God, and to oppress his
   glory. Furthermore, it is to be thought that though these matrons had
   not altogether given their name to Judaism, neither had they been
   nousled [845] in the doctrine of the law, yet were they half Jewesses,
   and that was the cause that they did so willingly take upon them the
   defense of the nation. For thus are women led about captive, being
   laden with sins, as Paul witnesseth.

   51. When they had shaken of the dust of their feet. We may also gather,
   even by the commandment of Christ, (Matthew 10:14; Luke 9:5; 10:11,)
   that this was a token of cursing among the Jews. For it is not to be
   thought that Christ meant to have his [disciples] use an unknown sign,
   forasmuch as it was his purpose to terrify the gross and professed
   condemners of his doctrine. Furthermore, he meant by this means to
   declare that God doth so detest the wicked, that we must take meat heed
   that we have no fellowship with them, lest we be infected with their
   uncleanness. All the wicked are said, indeed, to pollute the ground
   whereon they tread; but the Lord did never command that any, save only
   the condemners of his word, should be so rejected with such execration.
   If any adulterer or whoremonger, if any perjured person, if any
   drunkard, [846] were to be excommunicate, this sign was not used.
   Therefore, it appeareth how intolerable the contempt of the word of God
   is in his sight; because, when as he commandeth that the dust of the
   feet be shaken off, it is as much as if he should pronounce that they
   are the bond-slaves of Satan, men past hope, and worthy to be banished
   [847] from off the earth. Wherefore, let this so great;, severity teach
   us to reverence the gospel. Also the ministers of the word are taught
   with how great ferventness of zeal they must maintain the majesty of
   the word, that they do not coldly dissemble and wink at the contempt
   thereof.

   52. The disciples were filled with joy This member may be expounded two
   manner of ways; That they were filled with joy and the Spirit, by
   hypallage, thus, With joy of the Spirit, or (which is all one) with
   spiritual joy; because there is no quietness, peace, or joy of
   conscience, but it cometh of the Spirit of God, in which respect Paul
   saith that the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the
   Spirit, (Romans 14:17;) or that the word Spirit may contain under it
   other virtues and gifts. Yet this pleaseth me better, that they were
   filled with joy; because the grace of the Holy Spirit reigned in them,
   which alone doth so make us glad, truly and perfectly, that we are
   carried up above the whole world. For we must mark Luke's drift, that
   the faithful were so far from being troubled and shaken with those
   stumbling-blocks, how great soever they were, with the reproach of
   their teachers, with the disquieting of the city, with terrors and
   threatenings, also with fear and dangers hanging over their heads, that
   they did with the loftiness of their faith despise valiantly the
   gorgeousness, as well of their reigned holiness as of their power. And
   assuredly, if our faith shall be well grounded in God, and shall be
   thoroughly rooted in his word; and, finally, if' it shall be well
   fortified with the aid of the Spirit as it, ought, it; shall nourish
   peace and joy spiritual in our minds, though all the world be in an
   uproar.
