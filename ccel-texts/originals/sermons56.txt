The Preparatory Prayers of Christ

   (No. 3178)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 30TH, 1909,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST
   7, 1873.

   "Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus,
   also being baptized, and praying, the Heaven was opened, and the Holy
   Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a voice
   came from Heaven, which said, You are My Beloved Son, in You I am well
   pleased." Luke 3:21,22.

   "And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into a mountain to
   pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was day, He
   called unto Him, His disciples: and of them He chose twelve, whom also
   He named Apostles."

   Luke 6:12,13.

   "And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, He took
   Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. And as
   He prayed, the fashion of His Countenance was altered, and His raiment
   was white and glistening."

   Luke 9:28,29.

   "And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into a mountain
   apart to pray: and when the evening

   was come, He was there alone. But the boat was now in the midst of the
   sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. And in the fourth
   watch of the night, Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea."

   Matthew 14:23-25.

   "Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead were laid.
   And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You
   have heard Me. And I know that You hear Me always: but because of the
   people here, I said it, that they may believe that You have sent Me."

   John 11:41,42.

   "And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have
   you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for you, that
   your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen your
   brethren."

   Luke 22:31,32.

   "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He sad, Father, into Your
   hands I commend My spirit: and having said thus, He gave up the ghost."

   Luke 23:46.

   THERE is one peculiarity about the life of our Lord Jesus Christ which
   everybody must have noticed who has carefully read the four Gospels,
   namely, that He was a Man of much prayer. He was mighty as a Preacher,
   for even the officers who were sent to arrest Him said, "Never man
   spoke like this Man." But He appears to have been even mightier in
   prayer, if such a thing could be possible! We do not read that His
   disciples ever asked Him to teach them to preach, but we are told that,
   "as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, one of His
   disciples said unto Him, Lord, teach us to pray." He had no doubt been
   praying with such amazing fervor that His disciples realized that He
   was a master of the holy art of prayer and they, therefore, desired to
   learn the secret for themselves. The whole life of our Lord Jesus
   Christ was one of prayer. Though we are often told about His praying,
   we feel that we scarcely need to be informed of it, for we know that He
   must have been a Man of prayer. His acts are the acts of a prayerful
   Man. His words speak to us like the

   words of One whose heart was constantly lifted up in prayer to His
   Father. You could not imagine that He would have breathed out such
   blessings upon men if He had not first breathed in the atmosphere of
   Heaven! He must have been much in prayer or He could not have been so
   abundant in service and so gracious in sympathy.

   Prayer seems to be like a silver thread running through the whole of
   our Savior's life and we have the record of His prayers on many special
   occasions. It struck me that it would be both interesting and
   instructive for us to notice some of the seasons which Jesus spent in
   prayer. I have selected a few which occurred either before some great
   work or some great suffering, so our subject will really be the
   preparatory prayers of Christ--the prayers of Christ as He was
   approaching something which would put a peculiar stress and strain upon
   His Manhood, either for service or for suffering. And if the
   consideration of this subject shall lead all of us to learn the
   practical lesson of praying at all times--and yet to have special
   seasons for prayer just before any peculiar trial or unusual
   service--we shall not have met in vain!

   I. The first prayer we are to consider is OUR LORD'S PRAYER IN
   PREPARATION FOR HIS BAPTISM. It is in Luke 3:21, 22--"Now when all the
   people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus, also being baptized,
   and praying," (it seems to have been a continuous act in which He had
   been previously occupied), "the Heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit
   descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from
   Heaven, which said, You are My Beloved Son, in You I am well pleased."

   The Baptism of our Lord was the commencement of His manifestation to
   the sons of men. He was now about to take upon Himself in full all the
   works of His Messiahship and, consequently, we find Him very specially
   engaged in prayer. And, Beloved, it seems to me to be peculiarly
   appropriate that when any of us have been converted and are about to
   make a Scriptural profession of our faith--about to take up the
   soldier's life under the great Captain of our salvation--about to start
   out as pilgrims to Zion's city--I say that it seems to me to be
   peculiarly appropriate for us to spend much time in very special
   prayer! I would be very sorry to think that anyone would venture to
   come to be baptized, or to be united with a Christian Church without
   having made that action a matter of much solemn consideration and
   earnest prayer. But when the decisive step is about to be taken, our
   whole being should be very specially concentrated upon our supplication
   at the Throne of Grace.

   Of course we do not believe in any sacramental efficacy attaching to
   the observance of the ordinance, but we receive a special blessing in
   the act, itself, because we are moved to pray even more than usual
   before it takes place and at the time. At all events, I know that it
   was so in my own case. It was many years ago, but the remembrance of it
   is very vivid at this moment and it seems to me as though it only
   happened yesterday! It was in the month of May and I rose very early in
   the morning so that I might have a long time in private prayer. Then I
   had to walk about eight miles, from Newmarket to Isleham, where I was
   to be baptized in the river. I think that the blessing I received that
   day resulted largely from that season of solitary supplication and my
   meditation, as I walked along the country roads and lanes, upon my
   indebtedness to my Savior and my desire to live to His praise and
   Glory. Dear young people, take care that you start right in your
   Christian life by being much in prayer! A profession of faith that does
   not begin with prayer will end in disgrace. If you come to join the
   Church, but do not pray to God to uphold you in consistency of life,
   and to make your profession sincere, the probability is that you are
   already a hypocrite! Or if that is too uncharitable a suggestion, the
   probability is that if you are converted, the work has been of a very
   superficial character and not of that deep and earnest kind of which
   prayer would be the certain index. So again I say to you that if any of
   you are thinking of making a profession of your faith in Christ, be
   sure, then, in preparation for it, you devote a special season to
   drawing near to God in prayer.

   As I read the first text, no doubt you noticed that it was while Christ
   was praying that, "the Heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended
   in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from Heaven,
   which said, You are My Beloved Son, in You I am well pleased." There
   are three occasions of which we read in Scripture when God bore audible
   testimony to Christ And on each of these three occasions He was either
   in the act of prayer or He had been praying but a very short time
   before. Christ's prayer is especially mentioned in each instance side
   by side with the witness of His Father--and if you, beloved Friends,
   want to have the witness of God either at your Baptism or on any
   subsequent act of your life--you must obtain it by prayer! The Holy
   Spirit never sets His seal to a prayerless religion! It has not in it
   that of which He can approve. It must be truly said of a man, "Behold,
   he prays," before the Lord bears such testimony concerning him as He
   bore concerning Saul of Tarsus, "He is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear
   My name before the Gentiles."

   So we find that it was while Christ was praying at His Baptism that the
   Holy Spirit came upon Him, "in a bodily shape like a dove," to qualify
   Him for His public service! And it is through prayer that we, also,
   receive that spiritual enrichment that equips us as co-workers together
   with God. Without prayer you will remain in a region that is desolate
   as a desert! But bend your knees in supplication to the Most High and
   you have reached the land of promise, the country of benediction! "Draw
   near to God, and He will draw near to you," not merely as to His
   gracious Presence, but as to the powerful and efficacious working of
   the Holy Spirit! More prayer--more power! The more pleading with God
   that there is, the more power will there be in pleading with men, for
   the Holy Spirit will come upon us while we are pleading and so we shall
   be fitted and qualified to do the work to which we are called of God!

   Let us learn, then, from this first instance of our Savior's
   preparatory prayer at His Baptism, the necessity of special
   supplication on our part in similar circumstances. If we are making our
   first public profession of faith in Him, or if we are renewing that
   profession. If we are moving to another sphere of service, if we are
   taking office in the Church as deacons or elders, if we are commencing
   the work of the pastorate. If we are in any way coming out more
   distinctly before the world as the servants of Christ, let us set apart
   special seasons for prayer--and so seek a double portion of the Holy
   Spirit's blessing to rest upon us!

   II. The second instance of the preparatory prayers of Christ which we
   are to consider is OUR LORD'S PRAYER PREPARATORY TO CHOOSING HIS TWELVE
   APOSTLES. It is recorded in Luke 6:12, 13--"And it came to pass in
   those days, that He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all
   night in prayer to God. [See Sermon #798, Volume

   14--SPECIAL PROTRACTED PRAYER.] And when it was day, He called

   unto Him, His disciples: and of them He chose twelve, whom also He
   named Apostles."

   Our Lord was about to extend His ministry. His one tongue, His one
   voice might have delivered His personal message throughout Palestine,
   but He was desirous of having far more done than He could individually
   accomplish in the brief period of His public ministry upon earth. He
   would therefore have 12 Apostles and afterwards 70 disciples who would
   go forth in His name and proclaim the glad tidings of salvation. He was
   infinitely wiser than the wisest of mere men, so why did He not at once
   select His 12 Apostles? The men had been with Him from the beginning
   and He knew their characters and their fitness for the work He was
   about to entrust to them, so He might have said to Himself, "I will
   have James, John, Peter and the rest of the twelve, and send them forth
   to preach that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and to exercise the
   miraculous powers with which I will endow them." He might have done
   this if He had not been the Christ of God--but being the Anointed of
   the Father, He would not take such an important step as that without
   long continued prayer. So He went alone to His Father, told Him all
   that He desired to do and pleaded with Him, not in the brief fashion
   that we call prayer which usually lasts only a few minutes--but His
   pleading lasted through an entire night!

   What our Lord asked for, or how He prayed, we cannot tell, for it is
   not revealed to us. But I think we shall not be guilty of vain or
   unwarranted curiosity if we use our imagination for a minute or two. In
   doing so, with the utmost reverence, I think I hear Christ crying to
   His Father whom the right men might be selected as the leaders of the
   Church of God upon the earth. I think I also hear Him pleading that
   upon these chosen men a Divine influence might rest, that they might be
   kept in character, honest in heart and holy in life--and that they
   might also be preserved in sound Doctrine and not turn aside to error
   and falsehood. Then I think I hear Him praying that success might
   attend their preaching. That they might be guided where to go, where
   the blessing of God would go with them and that they might find many
   hearts willing to receive their testimony. And that when their personal
   ministry should end, they might pass on their commission to others so
   that as long as there should be a harvest to be reaped for the Lord,
   there should be laborers to reap it--as long as there should be lost
   sinners in the world, there would also be earnest, consecrated men and
   women seeking to pluck the brands from the burning. I will not attempt
   to describe the mighty wrestling of that night of prayer when, in
   strong cries and tears, Christ poured out His very soul into His
   Father's ear and heart! But it is clear that He would not dispatch a
   solitary messenger with the glad tidings of the Gospel unless He was
   assured that His Father's authority and the Spirit's power would
   accompany the servants whom He was about to send forth.

   What a lesson there is in all this to us! What Infallible Guidance
   there is here as to how a missionary society should be conducted! Where
   there is one committee meeting for business, there ought to be 50 for
   prayer! Whenever we get a missionary society whose main business it is
   to pray, we shall have a society whose distinguishing characteristic
   will be that it is the means of saving a multitude of souls! And to
   you, my dear young Brothers in the College, I feel moved to say that I
   believe we shall have a far larger blessing than we have already had
   when the spirit of prayer in the College is greater than it now is,
   though I rejoice to know that it is very deep and fervent even now!
   You, Brothers, have never been lacking in prayerfulness. I thank God
   that I have never had occasion to complain or to grieve on that
   account, but still, who knows what blessing might follow a night of
   prayer at the beginning or at any part of the session--or an all-night
   wrestling in prayer in the privacy of your own bedrooms? Then, when you
   go out to preach the Gospel on the Sabbath, you will find that the best
   preparation for preaching is much praying! I have always found that the
   meaning of a text can be better learned by prayer than in any other
   way. Of course we must consult lexicons and commentaries to see the
   literal meaning of the words and their relation to one another--but
   when we have done all that, we shall still find that our greatest help
   will come from prayer! Oh, that every Christian enterprise were
   commenced with prayer, continued with prayer and crowned with prayer!
   Then might we, also, expect to see it crowned with God's blessing!

   So once again I remind you that our Savior's example teaches us that
   for seasons of special service, we need not only prayers of a brief
   character, excellent as they are for ordinary occasions, but special
   protracted wrestling with God like that of Jacob at the Brook Jabbok,
   so that each one of us can say to the Lord, with holy determination--

   " With You all night I mean to stay,

   And wrestle till the break of day." When such sacred persistence in
   prayer as this becomes common throughout the whole Church of Christ,
   Satan's long usurpation will be coming to an end and we shall be able
   to say to our Lord, as the 70 disciples did when they returned to Him
   with joy, "Even the devils are subject unto us through Your name!"

   III. Now, thirdly, let us consider OUR LORD'S PRAYER PREPARATORY TO HIS
   TRANSFIGURATION. You will find it in Luke 9:28, 29--"And it came to
   pass about eight days after these sayings, He took Peter and John and
   James, and went up into a mountain to pray. And as He prayed, the
   fashion of His Countenance was altered, and His raiment was white and
   glistening." You see that it was as He prayed that He was transfigured.

   Now, Beloved, do you really desire to reach the highest possible
   attainments of the Christian life? Do you, in your inmost soul, pine
   and pant after the choicest joys that can be known by human beings this
   side of Heaven? Do you aspire to rise to full fellowship with the Lord
   Jesus Christ and to be transformed into His image from glory to glory?
   If so, the way is open to you! It is the way of prayer--only there will
   you find these priceless blessings! If you fail in prayer, you will
   assuredly never come to Tabor's top! There is no hope, dear Friends, of
   our ever attaining to anything like a transfiguration and being covered
   with the Light of God so that whether in the body or out of the body we
   cannot tell, unless we are much in prayer!

   I believe that we make more real advance in the Divine Life in an hour
   of prayer than we do in a month of hearing sermons. I do not mean that
   we are to neglect the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner
   of some is, but I am sure that without the praying, the hearing is of
   little worth! We must pray. We must plead with God if we are to really
   grow spiritually. In prayer, very much of our spiritual digestion is
   done. When we are hearing the Word, we are very much like the cattle
   when they are cropping the grass--but when we follow our hearing with
   meditation and prayer, we do, as it were, lie down in the green
   pastures--and get the rich nutriment for our souls out of the Truth of
   God. My dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, would you shake off the
   earthliness that still clings to you? Would you get rid of your doubts
   and your fears? Would you overcome your worldliness? Would you master
   all your besetting sins? Would you glow and glisten in the brightness
   and Glory of the holiness of God? Then be much in prayer, as Jesus was!
   I am sure that it must be so and that, apart from prayer, you will make
   no advance in the Divine Life--but that in waiting upon God, you shall
   renew your spiritual strength, you shall mount up with wings as eagles,
   you shall run and not be weary--you shall walk and not faint!

   IV. I must hasten on lest time should fail us before I have finished.
   And I must put together two of OUR LORD'S PRAYERS PREPARATORY TO GREAT
   MIRACLES.

   The first, which preceded His stilling of the tempest on the Lake of
   Gennesaret, is recorded in Matthew 14:23-25-- "And when He had sent the
   multitudes away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the
   evening was come, He was there alone. But the boat was now in the midst
   of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. And in the
   fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea." He
   had been pleading with His Father for His disciples and then, when
   their ship was tossed by the waves, and driven back by the contrary
   winds, He came down to

   them from the lofty place where He had been praying for them, making a
   pathway for Himself across the turbulent waters that He was about to
   calm. Before He walked upon those tossing billows, He had prayed to His
   Father. Before He stilled the storm, He had prevailed with God in
   prayer.

   Am I to do any great work for God? Then I must first be mighty upon my
   knees! Is there a man here who is to be the means of covering the sky
   with clouds and bringing the rain of God's blessing on the dry and
   barren Church which so sorely needs reviving and refreshing? Then he
   must be prepared for that great work as Elijah was when, on the top of
   Carmel, "He cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between
   his knees," and prayed as only he could pray! We shall never see a
   little cloud like a man's hand, which shall afterwards cover all the
   sky with blackness, unless first of all we know how to cry mightily
   unto the Most High! But when we have done that, then shall we see what
   we desire. Moses would never have been able to control the children of
   Israel as he did if he had not first been in communion with his God in
   the desert, and afterwards in the mountain. So if we are to be men of
   power, we also must be men of prayer!

   The other instance to which I want to refer, showing how our Lord
   prayed before working a mighty miracle, is when He stood by the grave
   of Lazarus. You will find the account of it in John 11:41, 42--"Then
   they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And
   Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have
   heard Me. And I know that You hear Me always: but because of the people
   here, I said it, that they may believe that You have sent Me." He did
   not cry, "Lazarus, come forth," so that the people heard it, and
   Lazarus heard it, until first He had prayed, "My Father, grant that
   Lazarus may rise from the dead," and had received the assurance that he
   would do so as soon as he was called by Christ to come forth from the
   grave.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, do you not see that if Christ, who was so
   strong, needed to pray thus, what need there is for us, who are so
   weak, to also pray? If He, who was God as well as Man, prayed to His
   Father before He worked a miracle, how necessary it is for us, who are
   merely men, to go to the Throne of Grace and plead there with
   importunate fervency if we are ever to do anything for God! I fear that
   many of us have been feeble out here in public because we have been
   feeble out there on the lone mountainside where we ought to have been
   in fellowship with God. The way to be fitted to work what men will call
   wonders, is to go to the God of Wonders and implore Him to gird us with
   His all-sufficient strength so that we may do exploits to His praise
   and Glory!

   V. The next prayer we are to consider is OUR LORD'S PRAYER PREPARATORY
   TO PETER'S FALL. We have the record of that in Luke 22:31, 32--"And the
   Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he
   may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail
   not: and when you are converted, strengthen your

   brethren." [See Sermons #2620, Volume 45--CHRIST'S PRAYER FOR PETER;
   #2034, Volume 34--PETER'S RESTORATION and #2035, Volume 34--PETER AFTER
   HIS RESTORATION.]

   There is much that is admirable and instructive in this utterance of
   our Lord. Satan had not then tempted Peter, yet Christ had already
   pleaded for the Apostle whose peril He clearly foresaw! Some of us
   would have thought that we were very prompt if we had prayed for a
   Brother or Sister who had been tempted and who had yielded to the
   temptation. But our Lord prayed for Peter before he was tempted. As
   soon as Satan had desired to have him in his sieve, that he might sift
   him as wheat, our Savior knew the thought that was formed in the
   diabolic mind--and He at once pleaded for His imperiled servant who did
   not even know the danger that was threatening him! Christ is always
   beforehand with us. Before the storm comes, He has provided the harbor
   of refuge. Before the disease attacks us, He has the remedy ready to
   cure it. His mercy outruns our misery!

   What a lesson we ought to learn from this action of Christ! Whenever we
   see any friend in peril through temptation, let us not begin to talk
   about him, but let us at once pray for him! Some persons are very fond
   of hinting and insinuating about what is going to happen to certain
   people with whom they are acquainted. I pray you, beloved Friends, not
   to do it! Do not hint that So-and-So is likely to fall, but pray that
   he may not fall. Do not insinuate anything about him to others, but
   tell the Lord what your anxiety is concerning him.

   "But So-and-So has made a lot of money and he is getting very
   purse-proud." Well, even if it is so, do not talk about him to others,
   but pray God to grant that he may not be allowed to become purse-proud.
   Do not say that he will be, but pray constantly that he may not be--and
   do not let anyone but the Lord know that you are praying for him.

   "Then there is So-and-So. He is so elated with the success he has had
   that one can scarcely get to speak to him." Well then, Brother, pray
   that he may not be elated. Do not say that you are afraid he is growing
   proud, for that would imply

   what you would be if you were in his place! Your fear reveals a secret
   concerning your own nature, for what you judge that he would be is
   exactly what you would do in similar circumstances! We always measure
   other people's corn with our own bushel--we do not borrow their bushel.
   And we can judge ourselves by our judgment of others. Let us cease
   these censures and judgments--and let us pray for our Brothers and
   Sisters. If you fear that a minister is somewhat turning aside from the
   faith, or if you think that his ministry is not so profitable as it
   used to be, or if you see any other imperfection in him, do not go and
   talk about it to people in the street, for they cannot set him
   right--go and tell his Master about him! Pray for him and ask the Lord
   to make right whatever is wrong. There is a sermon by old Matthew Wilks
   about our being Epistles of Christ, written not with ink, and not on
   tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart. And he said that
   ministers are the pens with which God writes on their hearts'
   hearts--and that pens need sharpening every now and then--but even when
   they are sharp, they cannot write without ink! So he said that the best
   service that the people could render to the preacher was to pray the
   Lord to give them new pens and dip them in the fresh ink that they
   might write better than before! Do so, dear Friends--do not blot the
   page with your censures and unkind remarks, but help the preacher by
   pleading for him even as Christ prayed for Peter!

   VI. Now I must close with our LORD'S PREPARATORY PRAYER JUST BEFORE HIS
   DEATH. You will find it in Luke 23:46--"And when Jesus had cried with a
   loud voice, He said, Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit:

   and having said thus, He gave up the ghost." [See Sermons #2311, Volume
   39--OUR LORD'S LAST CRY FROM THE CROSS and #2644, Volume 45-- THE LAST
   WORDS OF CHRIST ON THE CROSS.]

   Our Lord Jesus was very specially occupied in prayer as the end of His
   earthly life drew near. He was about to die as His people's Surety and
   Substitute. The wrath of God, which was due to them, fell upon Him!
   Knowing all that was to befall Him, "He set His face steadfastly to go
   unto Jerusalem" and, in due time, "He endured the Cross, despising the
   shame." But He did not go to Gethsemane and Golgotha without prayer!
   Son of God as He was, He would not undergo that terrible ordeal without
   much supplication. You know how much there is about His praying in the
   later chapters of John's Gospel. There is especially that great prayer
   of His for His Church in which He pleaded with amazing fervor for those
   whom His Father had given Him. Then there was His agonized pleading in
   Gethsemane when "His sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood
   falling down to the ground." We will not say much about that, but we
   can well imagine that the bloody sweat was the outward and visible
   expression of the intense agony of His soul which was "exceedingly
   sorrowful, even unto death."

   All that Christ did and suffered was full of prayer, so it was but
   fitting that His last utterance on earth should be the prayerful
   surrender of His spirit into the hands of His Father. He had already
   pleaded for His murderers, "Father, forgive them: for they know not
   what they do." He had promised to grant the request of the penitent
   thief, "Lord, remember me when You come into Your Kingdom." Now nothing
   remained for Him to do but to say, "Father, into Your hands I commend
   My spirit: and having said thus, He gave up the ghost." His life, which
   had been a life of prayer, was thus closed with prayer--an example well
   worthy of His people's imitation!

   Perhaps I am addressing someone who is conscious that a serious illness
   is threatening. Well then, dear Friend, prepare for it by prayer! Are
   you dreading a painful operation? Nothing will help you to bear it so
   well as pleading with God concerning it! Prayer will help you mentally
   as well as physically--you will face the ordeal with far less fear if
   you have laid your care before the Lord and committed yourself--body,
   soul and spirit--into His hands. If you are expecting, before long, to
   reach the end of your mortal life either because of your advanced age,
   or your weak constitution, or the inroads of the deadly
   consumption--pray much. You need not fear to be baptized in Jordan's
   swelling flood if you are constantly being baptized in prayer! Think of
   your Savior in the Garden and on the Cross--and pray even as He
   did--"Not my will, but yours be done...Father, into Your hands I
   commend my spirit."

   While I have been speaking to Believers in our Lord Jesus Christ, there
   may have been some here who are still unconverted--who have imagined
   that prayer is the way to Heaven--yet it is not! Prayer is a great and
   precious help on the road, but Christ, alone, is the Way! And the very
   first step heavenward is to trust ourselves wholly to Him. Faith in
   Christ is the all-important matter and if you truly believe in Him, you
   are saved! But the very first thing that a saved man does is to
   pray--and the very last thing that he does before he gets to Heaven is
   to pray. Well did Montgomery write--

   "Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice, Returning from his ways While
   angels in their songs rejoice,

   And cry, 'Behold, he prays!' Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
   The Christian's native air! His watchword at the gates of death He
   enters Heaven with prayer!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 18:1-14

   Verse 1. And he spoke a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
   always to pray and not to faint. [See Sermon

   #2519, Volume 43--WHEN SHOULD WE PRAY?] An old writer says that

   many of Christ's parables need a key to unlock them. Here, the key
   hangs outside the door, for at the very beginning of the parable we are
   told what Christ meant to teach by it--"that men ought always to pray,
   and not to faint." And this is the parable.

   2. Saying, There was in a city a judge who feared not God, neither
   regarded man. It is a great pity for any city and for any country where
   the judges do not fear God--where they feel that they have been put
   into a high office in which they may do just as they please. There were
   such judges in the olden times even in this land--God grant that we may
   not see any more like them!

   3. And there was a widow in that city and she came unto him, saying,
   Avenge me of my adversary. She had no friend to plead for her. She had
   nobody to help her and, therefore, when she was robbed of her little
   patrimony, she went to the court and asked the judge for justice.

   4. And he would not for a while. He preferred to be unjust. As he could
   do as he liked, he liked to do as he should

   not.

   4, 5. But afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor
   regard man, yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest
   by her continual coming she weary me.She seems to have gone to him so
   often that he grew quite fatigued and pained by her persistence! The
   Greek words are very expressive, as though she had beaten him in the
   eyes and so bruised him that he could not endure it any longer. Of
   course, the poor woman had not done anything of the kind--but the judge
   thus describes her continual importunity as a wounding of him, as an
   attacking of him, an assault upon him--for he had, perhaps, a little
   conscience left. He had, at least, enough honesty to confess that he
   did not fear God, nor regard man. There are some of whom that is true,
   who will not admit it, but this judge admitted it--and though he was
   but little troubled about it--he said, "that I may not be worried to
   death by this woman's continual coming, I will grant her request and
   avenge her of her adversary."

   6, 7. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says. And shall not
   God avenge His own elect who cry day and

   night unto Him, though He bears long with them?[See Sermon #2836,
   Volume 6--PRAYERFUL IMPORTUNITY.] He is no unjust judge! He is One who
   is perfectly holy, just, true and who appears in a nearer and dearer
   Character than that of judge, even as the One who chose His people from
   eternity! "Shall not God avenge His own elect?" Yes, that He will--only
   let them persevere in prayer and "cry day and night unto Him."

   8. I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the
   Son of Man comes, shall He find faith on the

   earth?[See Sermon #1963, Volume 33--THE SEARCH FOR FAITH.] If anybody

   can find it, He can, for He is the Creator of it! Yet, when He comes,
   there will be so little of it in proportion to what He deserves, and so
   little in proportion to the loving kindness of the Lord, that it will
   seem as if even He could not find it-- although if there were only as
   much faith as a grain of mustard seed He would be the first to spy it
   out!

   9. And He spoke this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves
   that they were righteous, and despised others. It seems as if these two
   things went together--as our esteem of ourselves goes up, our esteem of
   others goes down--the scales seem to work that way.

   10. Two men went up into the Temple to pray. [See Sermon #2395, Volume
   41--THE BLESSINGS OF PUBLIC WORSHIP.] It was the place that was
   specially dedicated for prayer. It was the place

   where God had promised to meet with suppliants. They did well, in those
   days, to go up into the Temple to pray to God. Though, in these days--

   " Wherever we seek Him, He is found, And everyplace is hallowed
   ground."

   It is sheer superstition which imagines that one place is better for
   prayer than another! So long as we can be quiet and still, let us pray
   wherever we may be.

   10, 11. The one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee
   stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank You that I am not as
   other men are--extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
   publican It is possible that this was all true. We have no indication
   that he was a hypocrite--and if what he said was true--there was
   something in it for which he might well thank God. It was a great mercy
   not to be an extortioner, nor unjust, nor an adulterer--but what spoilt
   his expression of thankfulness was that back-handed blow at the other
   man who was praying in the same Temple-- "or even as this publican."
   What had the Pharisee to do with him? He had quite enough to occupy his
   thoughts if he could only see himself as he really was in God's sight!

   12. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I posses.
   Observe that there is no prayer in all that the Pharisee said. There
   was a great deal of self-righteousness and self-congratulation, but
   nothing else. There was certainly no prayer at all in it!

   13. And the publican, standing afar off-- Just on the edge of the
   crowd, keeping as far away as he could from the Most Holy Place--

   13. Would not lift up so much as his eyes unto Heaven, but smote upon
   his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinne. [See Sermon #1949,
   Volume 33--A SERMON FOR THE WORST MAN ON EARTH.] That was allprayer--it
   was a prayer for mercy, it was a prayer in which the suppliant took his
   right place, for he was, as he said, "a sinner." He does not describe
   himself as a penitent sinner, or as a praying sinner, but simply as a
   sinner. And as a sinner, he goes to God asking for mercy. Our English
   version does not give the full meaning of the publican's prayer, it is,
   "God be propitious to me," that is, "be gracious to me through the
   ordained Sacrifice." And that is one of the points of the prayer that
   made it so acceptable to God. There is a mention of the Atonement in
   it. There is a pleading of the sacrificial blood. It was a real prayer
   and an acceptable prayer--while the Pharisee's boasting was not a
   prayer at all.

   14. I tell you, this man--This publican, sinner as he had been, though
   he had no broad phylacteries like the Pharisee had, though he may not
   have washed his hands before he came into the Temple, as, no doubt the
   Pharisee did--this man, who could not congratulate himself upon his own
   excellence, "this man"--

   14. Went down to his house justified rather than the other He obtained
   both justification and the peace of mind that comes from it! God smiled
   upon him and set him at ease concerning his sin. The other man received
   no justification--he had not sought it and he did not get it. He had a
   kind of spurious ease of mind when he went into the Temple and he
   probably carried it away with him! But he certainly was not justified
   in the sight of God. [See Sermon #2687, Volume 46--

   TOO GOOD TO BE SAVED!]

   14. For everyone that exalts himself shall be abased; and he that
   humbles himself shall be exalted. God turns things upside down! If we
   think much of ourselves, He makes us little, and if we make little of
   ourselves, we shall find that a humble and contrite heart He will not
   despise! May He teach us so to pray that we may go down to our house
   justified, as the publican was!

A Comprehensive Benediction

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even our Father, who has
   loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope
   through Grace, comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good
   word and work." 2 Thessalonians 2:16,17.

   [Other Sermons by Mr. Spurgeon, upon the same text, are Sermons, #1542,
   Volume 26--FREE GRACE A MOTIVE FOR FREE GIVING;

   #2363, Volume 40--COMFORT AND CONSTANCY and #2991, Volume 52--WHAT WE
   HAVE, AND ARE TO HAVE.]

   ALL through his Epistles, Paul is continually expressing his best
   wishes for the friends to whom he writes. The Christian should be a
   well-wisher to all men. No cursing should ever come out of his mouth,
   but his lips should always distil blessings even upon his enemies--and
   much more upon his friends. Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus, it
   should be a part of our religion to be desiring the best of blessings
   for our fellow men. As the high priest of old blessed the people, so
   should those whom God has made to be priests and kings unto Himself--a
   privilege that pertains to all saints-- exercise the function of
   blessing the people by desiring good things for them!

   The blessing invoked in the text is very comprehensive, but although
   there is much to crave, there is much more to acknowledge with
   gratitude. Blessings already secured in the Covenant are the foundation
   of a rich expectancy for the supply of all our present needs. We may
   reasonably hope that God will do in the future what He has done in the
   past. Hence the Apostle speaks very plainly of what God the Father and
   our Lord Jesus Christ have already bestowed--and then he couples
   therewith the kindest wishes as to the future of his friends at
   Thessalonica.

   With as much brevity as possible, I shall first speak on that part of
   the text which contains two positive facts. And then upon that part of
   it which expresses two holy desires.

   I. The 16th verse contains A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT OF THE TWO POSITIVE
   FACTS.

   Paul, writing concerning believers in Christ at Thessalonica and
   everywhere else, says, "Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God,
   even our Father, who has loved us and has given us everlasting
   consolation and good hope through Grace." From this we gather that
   every true Believer--everyone who rests upon Christ and is saved
   through the effectual working of the Holy Spirit--is, at the present
   moment, first of all, the object of the love of God--"who has loved
   us." So, my Friends, Paul does not speak of God as though we were
   strangers to Him and He is a stranger to us, but he says, "who has
   loved us." Concerning this matter, he does not speak as one who was in
   doubt--with mingled hope and fear-- but he says positively, "Our Lord
   Jesus Christ, Himself, and God, even our Father, who has l oved us." He
   is quite sure of it! He is certain that these people to whom he is
   writing, and all believers in Jesus, are the objects of Divine Love!

   Will you turn that Truth of God over in your minds, dear Friends,
   making a personal application of it at this moment? If you are now
   trusting in Jesus Christ, God loves you! That He should think of you is
   something! That He should pity you is more. That He should bear with
   you and have patience with you is no small thing--but think of God
   loving you! That Infinite Being whom the Heaven of heavens cannot
   contain, whose years are eternal, whose existence knows no limit nor
   shadow of a change--He loves you and yet you are, compared with Him,
   nothing--yes, less than nothing and vanity! Could you conceive of an
   angel loving an ant? Could you imagine one of the seraphs being in love
   with the gnat which dances in the sunbeam? It would be wonderful
   condescension for the august spirits to love such insignificant
   creatures, yet it would be only one creature loving another creature!
   And between one creature and another, the distance cannot be as great
   as between the Creator and the created one! That God, the Eternal,
   Infinite, Almighty I AM, should actually condescend to love us, who are
   but as worms compared with Him and who are but as things of yesterday,
   soon

   gone, oh, 'tis strange, 'tis passing strange, 'tis amazing! Yet though
   it exceeds marvel, it does not, thank God, exceed belief! But were it
   not that God has, Himself, revealed it, we might have cause enough to
   suppose it to be impossible that the Lord Jesus Christ and God, even
   our Father, should have loved us!

   Being spoken of in the past tense, I infer that the love which God has
   for Believers is no novelty. He did not commence to love them
   yesterday. Brothers and Sisters, we believe that as many as have been
   called by Grace have been the objects of a love that never knew a
   beginning! Long before the stars were lit, or the sun's refulgent ray
   had pierced through primeval shade, the heart of Deity had fixed itself
   upon the chosen! The prescient eyes of God had seen them when as yet
   they were not--and in His book all their names were written, which in
   continuance were fashioned when as yet there were none of them! They
   were not merely foreknown, but they were foreloved! They were the
   favorites of His heart, the dear ones of His choice. He "has loved us."
   Fly back as far as you will--till time has not begun, the work of
   Creation is not accomplished and God dwells alone--it was still true of
   all Believers, even then, that "God, even our Father, has loved us."

   Is it not marvelous that we should have been the objects of a love that
   has been so constant? For, as there never was any beginning to it, so
   there never has been a period in which that love has grown dim towards
   those who were the objects of it! The river of God's Love has gone
   flowing on in one undiminished stream even until now! He "has loved
   us." He loved us when our father Adam plunged us into the ruins of the
   Fall. He loved us when He spoke the first promise in the Garden of
   Eden, that the Seed of the woman would bruise the serpent's head. He
   loved us all through the prophetic days when He was writing the Book of
   Love upon which our delighted eyes were afterwards to gaze. He loved us
   when He sent His Son, His only Son, to live our life and to die our
   death! He loved us when He exalted that Son of His to His own right
   hand--and in His Person exalted us there, too, and made us to sit in
   heavenly places together with Him. He loved us when we were little
   children, in the weakness of infancy hanging upon our mother's breasts.
   He loved us when, in the follies of our youth, we seemed determined to
   destroy ourselves while He was determined that we should be saved. He
   loved us when we loved not Him. He drew us with the cords of a man and
   with the bands of love--and now, even at this day--we can, each one of
   us, look up to Him and say, "Abba! Father! You are mine and I am Yours
   by the Spirit of adoption." Yes, we can say this! We can look back all
   along our past lives and right beyond our birth into eternity past, and
   we can thank Him that we can truly say, "God, even our Father, has
   loved us."

   Now, my dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, you must not be satisfied
   unless you can speak about God's love to you in the same positive terms
   as those which were used by the Apostle Paul. Never rest contented if
   you do not know that God loves you! Give no sleep to your eyes, nor
   slumber to your eyelids until, by a living faith, you have been able to
   read your title clear to this love of God! It may be that you have lost
   the sensible presence of that love--then ask for Divine Grace to search
   until you find it again. You may be saved and yet you may not be happy,
   but you ought never be content unless you are certain that you are
   saved--and then such certainty will infallibly bring you peace and joy.
   If now your full assurance has departed and your faith is under a
   cloud, come and knock again at Mercy's door and cling to the posts
   thereof, looking up at the Crucified One. Turn your tearful eyes to
   Calvary, trusting afresh to Him whose wounds will give you healing and
   in the crimson lines of whose agonies you must read your acceptance. Go
   there, I say, and be not content till you can say with Paul, "Our Lord
   Jesus Christ, Himself, and God, even our Father, has loved us." This is
   the first positive fact which is here mentioned.

   There is another fact which is equally positive--"and has given us
   everlasting consolation and good hope through Graced It is absolutely
   certain that God has given His people this double blessing. What a
   delightful blessing this is, "everlasting consolation"! There is music
   in the word, "consolation." Barnabas was called "the son of
   consolation." No, more than that, it is the name of One who is far
   greater than Barnabas, for the Lord Jesus is called "the Consolation of
   Israel." But God is here said to have given this blessing to His people
   in a very special form-- "everlasting consolation." A man goes to work
   to make money and, after toiling hard for it, he gets it and it is a
   consolation to him. But it is not an everlastingconsolation, for he may
   spend or he may lose all his money. He may invest it in some company
   (limited or unlimited), and very soon find it vanish! Or he may be
   compelled by death to leave it. It cannot be, at the best, more than a
   temporary consolation. A man toils hard for knowledge. He acquires it.
   He becomes eminent, his name is famous. This is a consolation to him
   for all his toil, but it cannot last long, for when he comes to feel
   the headache or the heartache, his degrees and his fame cannot cheer
   him. Or when his soul becomes a prey to despondency, he may turn over
   many a

   learned tome before he will find a cure for melancholy. His consolation
   is but frail and fickle--it will only serve to cheer him at
   intermittent seasons--it is not "everlasting consolation." But I
   venture to say that through the consolation which God gives to His
   people, they are unsurpassed for their endurance! They can stand all
   tests--the shock of trial, the bursting out of passion, the lapse of
   years--no, more--they can even endure the passage to eternity, for God
   has given to His people "everlasting consolation."

   What is this "everlasting consolation"? It includes a sense of pardoned
   sin. A Christian, when his heart is right, knows that God has pardoned
   his sins, that He has cast them behind His back, and that they will
   never be mentioned against him again. He has received in his heart the
   witness of the Spirit that God has blotted out, as a thick cloud, his
   transgressions and, as a cloud, his sins. Well, if sin is pardoned, is
   not that a consolation? Yes, and an everlasting consolation, too--one
   that will do to live with and that will do to die with--and that will
   do to rise again with! Oh, joy! My sins are pardoned! Now do what You
   will with me, my God! As my sins are put away, You have given me
   "everlasting consolation."

   This "everlasting consolation" also gives an abiding sense of
   acceptance in Christ. The Christian knows that God looks upon him as he
   is in Christ and, inasmuch as God put Christ into his place, and
   punished Christ for his sin, He now puts the Believer into Christ's
   place and rewards that Believer with His love just as if he had been
   obedient unto death, as Christ was! It is a blessed thing to know that
   God accepts us and to be able to sing, with Hart--

   " With my Savior's garments on,

   Holy as the Holy One"--

   and this is a consolation which is abiding. It is, in fact,
   everlasting! Now let sickness come--the consolation still abides. Have
   we not seen hundreds of Believers as happy in the weakness of disease
   as they would have been in the strength of hale and vigorous health?
   Let death come--the consolation still remains. Have not these ears
   often heard the songs of dying saints as they have rejoiced because the
   love of God was shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Spirit? Yes, a
   sense of acceptance in the Beloved is an "everlasting consolation."

   Moreover, the Christian has a conviction of his security in Christ. God
   has promised to save all those who trust in Jesus. The Christian does
   trust in Him and he believes that God will be as good as His word and
   will save him. He feels, therefore, that whatever may occur in
   Providence, whatever onslaughts there may be of inward corruption, or
   of outward temptation, he is safe by virtue of his union to Christ--is
   not this a source of consolation? Why, some of you might freely give
   your eyes to know that you are saved! It would be a good bargain for
   men even to be lame or maimed if they did but enter into life. The
   Christian knows that he is secure--beneath the shield of the Divine
   Omnipotence he laughs at the rage of Hell, feeling that no fiery dart
   can ever pierce that sacred protection! Are you rejoicing in this
   everlasting consolation? If not, you should seriously question whether
   you know what true religion means. Do you find that your losses make
   you wretched? Do bereavements in your family make you murmur and
   complain? Are you never happy? Does not joy ever come into your spirit?
   Do you always hang your head like a bulrush? Have you no peace of mind,
   no sacred mirth? Do the bells of your heart never ring? Do the
   heart-strings of your soul never sound out the music of grateful
   praise? Then gravely question whether you can be a child of God, for
   concerning the children of God it is written, "God, even our Father,
   has given us everlasting consolation."

   I am sure there are many here who, if they were to speak from
   experience, would say, "Well, we are very poor, but we are rich in
   faith, and faith makes us rich toward God. We have not anything to
   spare, yet surely goodness and mercy have followed us all the days of
   our life. We are sick in body, yet our afflictions are so sanctified
   that we rejoice in deep distress. We are ridiculed and slandered by the
   ungodly, but we rejoice that we are counted worthy to suffer anything
   for Christ's sake. Yes, God has given us everlasting consolation!" John
   Bunyan said that the man who wears the flower, "heart's ease," in his
   bosom need not envy a king! And that is a flower which the Christian
   always wears in his buttonhole--or if he does not always wear it there,
   it is his own fault, for God has given it to him--He has given unto us
   everlasting, unchanging, unfading, inexhaustible fountains of
   consolation!

   Another thing which God has given us is "good hope through Grace"--a
   hope, a good hope--a "good hope through Grace." What is the Christian's
   hope? It is a hope that he shall be preserved in this life by God's
   love and kindness. A hope that when he comes to die--for die he must
   unless the Lord shall come first--he shall have all-sufficient Grace to
   be able to play the man in the last solemn article. He has the hope
   that, after death, his soul, out-soaring sun, Volume 56
   www.spurgeongems.org 3

   moon and stars, shall enter into the realm of spirits and be with
   Christ! He believes that the day shall come when his very body, though
   it has become food for worms, shall be quickened and called by the
   voice of the archangel from its bed of dust and its silent sleeping
   place. He believes that those bones of his shall live again and that
   his soul and body shall be reunited and that, when the Lord Jesus shall
   stand at the Last Day upon the earth, in his flesh he shall see God! So
   he sings with Toplady--

   "These eyes shall see Him in that Day, The God that died for me! And
   all my rising bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto Thee?"

   This is the Christian's hope, that he shall then live, world without
   end, in the perfection of enjoyment! That he shall have all spiritual
   joys in communion with Christ--and all joys that shall be suitable to
   his new and spiritual body as he shall walk the golden streets and
   forever praise the love which brought him into an existence of perfect
   bliss! This is the Christian's hope and, consequently, the thought of
   death does not alarm him--rather, he looks forward to it with joy! As
   the toil-worn laborer does not dread the eventide when he shall put off
   his dusty robes, but longs for the night that he may rest in his bed,
   so the Christian, when he is in his right mind--

   "Longs for evening, to undress,

   That he may rest with God."

   He is willing to put off the cumbrous clay of his body and commit it to
   the purifying earth, that he may, as a disembodied spirit, depart to be
   "with Christ, which is far better," expecting that, afterwards, body
   and soul together shall be forever gratified with Christ!

   This is the Christian's hope and it is a good hope. It is good for what
   it brings us, but it is especially good for that upon which it is
   grounded. The reason why the Christian expects this eternal happiness
   is because God has promised it to him and has given him an earnest of
   it. He has Heaven in his heart even now. That is to say, he has within
   him the beginning of that life which shall, in due time, become the
   heavenly life. In olden times, when men bought an estate, it was
   customary for the seller to give to the purchaser a tuft of grass and a
   leaf from one of the trees on the land, signifying that the purchaser
   then had what was called seizin of the property, and they were proofs
   that it belonged to him. And when God gives true faith in Christ and
   enables a soul to have peace with God through the precious blood, this
   is the earnest of Heaven, a foretaste of its bliss and sure evidence
   that Heaven is, indeed, ours. I trust that there are many of us who
   have this earnest and feel comforted by it. We have a good hope because
   it is founded upon God's promise in His Word and upon the witness of
   the Spirit within our heart that we are born of God!

   And it is said to be a good hope through Grace." Ah, Friends, there is
   no good hope except "through Grace." You cannot have a good hope
   through merit. If anybody expects to have a good hope through baptism,
   he is very much mistaken! Baptism is simply the testimony of a good
   conscience toward God--it cannot give any hope of Heaven. If we were to
   build upon such a foundation as baptism, confirmation, the Lord's
   Supper, or anything of the kind, we should be sad losers, for there is
   nothing in all these things put together to make a Christian's hope!
   Nor must we build our hopes on our prayers or our tears, or on anything
   that we can do, for if so, it will be a sandy foundation and when the
   time of trial comes, it will give way under us. But to have a good hope
   through Divine Grace--such a hope as this--that I, a poor unworthy
   sinner, have been invited by God to put my trust in His dear Son, and
   that He has promised that if I do, I shall be saved! I do trust in
   Jesus and, therefore, if God has promised truly, I shall be saved--this
   is indeed a foundation on which I may build without fear! Is not this,
   my Brothers and Sisters, the top and bottom of the Christian's hope,
   that "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners," and that
   whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life?
   You do believe in Him and, therefore, you can say that you do possess
   eternal life! I do solemnly declare that if I have ever at any time
   begun to say in my own mind, "I shall be saved, for I have preached the
   Gospel, I have experienced such-and-such enjoyments, I have drawn near
   to God in secret prayer"--if ever I have talked to myself like that, I
   have soon been led to see that if I had not something infinitely better
   than all that to trust to, I would be resting on a broken reed. But,
   oh, to come to Jesus just as one came, at the first, saying--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring-- Simply to Your Cross I cling. Naked,
   come to You for dress.

   Helpless, look to You for Grace. Foul, I to the Fountain fly-- Wash me,
   Savior, or I die!'

   This is, indeed, to have a "good hope through Grace."

   Now let us take these two statements, look at them again, and then lay
   them up among our choicest treasures. The one statement is that God has
   loved us. O Christian Friends, do try to drink in that great Truth of
   God! Do not be satisfied simply to hear the words repeated, but get
   them right into your very spirits--"Our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, and
   God, even our Father, has loved us." O you angels, you have not even in
   Heaven a greater joy than this--to know that God has loved us! The
   other statement is that God "has given us everlasting consolation and
   good hope through Grace." So we cannot be without consolation. Whatever
   your trouble may be, my dear Christian Friend, though you may have lost
   your dearest one, though your property may have melted as the snowflake
   melts into the sea, yet God has given you eternal consolation--and
   whatever you may have to fear concerning the future, you have a hope
   that is broader than your fears!--

   "This is the hope, the blissful hope, The hope by Jesus given! The hope
   when days and years are past, We all shall meet in Heaven!'

   As I turned this text over, I could not help pitying those who have no
   hope, no good hope through Divine Grace. When I opened my letters this
   afternoon, on coming back from Liverpool, the first one I opened was to
   tell me of the death of one with whom I spent a very happy day about a
   fortnight ago. He seemed to me to be in perfect health when I spoke to
   him, then, but now he is gone to his eternal rest. The next letter I
   opened came from the deacon of a Church in Devonshire, to say that one
   of our students, who was settled there as a minister, had been suddenly
   taken ill and had just died. I did not care to open any more letters,
   just then, for fear that I would read of somebody else being gone. But
   I thought, "Well, both of these dear Brothers have served their
   generation by the will of God, and they have fallen asleep, and it is
   well." I could only look forward with hope to the day when somebody
   would read just such a letter about me-- and could only trust that they
   would be there to say of me what I could say of these
   Brothers--"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord."

   But what a sad thing it is to live in this world and to have no hope!
   It would have been better not to have lived at all than to live without
   a "good hope through Grace." I do not really know how some of you
   manage to live. I know you have your troubles--troubles at home and
   troubles in business--and I cannot make out how you manage to put up
   with this poor existence without the hope of a better one! Knowing what
   we do about a future state, if we had not a good hope concerning it, we
   really might wish that we had never been born. And we sometimes wonder
   how some of you can be so easy and so careless about the unknown state
   when you, perhaps, know that you will soon be in that state and also
   know that if it is not a better state than this one, it will be a very
   sad thing for you to have had an existence at all! Oh, "seek you the
   Lord while He may be found! Call upon Him while He is near." A good
   hope can be had through Divine Grace and that Grace is free even to the
   chief of sinners! If we come to God on the footing of Divine Grace, He
   will never cast us out. Oh, that we might all have this infinite
   treasure of a "good hope through Grace"!

   II. Now I can spend only a few minutes upon the second part of the
   subject in which we have TWO GOOD WISHES, TWO HOLY DESIRES. The first
   part of the text has told us what God has given us. The second part
   tells us what we ought to desire God to give us--"Comfort your hearts,
   and establish you in every good word and work."

   I pray God for those who are about to be baptized and also for you who
   have long made a profession of your faith, that you may get the first
   blessing, namely, Divine comfort. May God comfort you! It is a bad case
   when a Christian is not happy, when he is not full of comfort. I know
   it is treated by some people as though it were a very insignificant
   matter whether a Christian is happy or not, but I am sure it is an
   exceedingly important matter that he should have comfort. A wretched,
   miserable Christian is, to a great extent, an injury to the Church, and
   a dishonor to the Cross of Christ, for worldly people will pick out
   such an one and say, "That is what your religion does for a man!" Now,
   genuine godliness gives peace and joy. In its first beginning, when a
   man is under a sense of sin, it does make him wretched to feel his sin,

   but when the soul is obedient to the command of Christ and trusts in
   Him, it gives him joy and peace. "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
   peace"--and for a Christian not to have this fruit of the Spirit is to
   libel Christianity!

   When one's heart is sad, it is not always best to show it. "When you
   fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that you appear not unto men
   to fast." Even if you have some sorrow of heart, tell it not at once to
   your neighbor, who may have quite enough trouble of his own to bear
   without having yours added to it! Do, Christian, seek to get the
   comfort of which the Apostle here speaks. Is there ever a position into
   which you and I can be cast where there is no comfort for us in the
   Divine promises? There is, in God's Word, a key to open all the locks
   of trouble in Doubting Castle! If we will but turn over the sacred
   pages, we shall find there a promise exactly suited to our case. Do you
   lack comfort, Christian? How can you while there is a Mercy Seat to go
   to and One there whose ears are always open to hear your petition and
   to relieve your trouble? Do you lack comfort while you can pray? Surely
   it must be neglect of prayer that makes your burdens so heavy. How can
   you be without comfort while your Savior lives? If Jesus Christ still
   bears your name upon His heart, that should be enough for you! Is it
   not really a comfort to think that the Father, Himself, loves you? My
   Father, who is in Heaven, knows my needs--ought not that to cheer me?
   Midst darkest shades, if I feel that He is with me--yes, even in the
   Valley of the Shadow of Death--if His rod and His staff comfort me,
   what have I to fear? Yes, Christian Friends, you have abundant ground
   for comfort, so be not content unless you enjoy that comfort! May God,
   even your Father, put you and keep you in a comfortable frame of mind!

   I would say especially to young Christians--Do not imagine that as soon
   as you become believers in Christ, you are to cast away those cheerful
   looks and those bright eyes of yours. God forbid! If you were happy,
   before, be far happier now! You need not have levity--that is to be
   avoided--and the pleasure which consists in sin should be no pleasure
   to you, but now your joy should be deeper as it is purer, more lively
   as it is more sound!

   "And establish you in every good word and work" These are the two forms
   of establishment in good Doctrine and in good practice. When a
   Christian receives good words, the devil would like to drive them from
   him and to drive him from them. It is one of the masterpieces of Satan
   to try to spoil our faith. If he can lead us to believe falsely, he
   will the more easily lead us to actfalsely. So may God "establish you
   in every good word."You cannot help noticing, if you look upon the
   spiritual firmament just now, how like it is to what the natural
   firmament was the other night. It is said that there were thousands of
   shooting stars visible within an hour! And I might almost say that if
   you look out into the Christian world, you can see thousands of
   shooting stars within a minute! I do not know what new error we shall
   have within the next 24 hours. There are some people who are so fond of
   novelties that they have advanced pretty nearly every form of error
   that our poor imagination can conceive of, yet they seem to be studious
   to make fresh ones! We have new "isms" and "ites" of all sorts, but
   old-fashioned Truths of God, which we thought would never have been
   doubted, are, nowadays, contested! An age of great religious activity
   is pretty sure to be also an age in which error is active and,
   therefore, it is the more necessary that we should pray for Believers
   that they may be established in every good word!

   I should like you who are members of this Church not only to believe
   the Truth, but to know why you believe itand to be so sure and certain
   of it that you cannot be shaken from it! I would have you be not like
   the dry leaves in autumn, which are carried away by the first wind
   because they have lost their vitality, but like the green leaves in
   spring which will bear the March winds and cannot be torn off because
   their sap is flowing in them and they are fresh and vigorous. I would
   that you were always able to give a reason for the hope that is in you
   with meekness and fear. The faith which we have has been handed down to
   us by martyrs' hands all along the ages--not through the corrupt Church
   of Rome--but down along the line of martyrs and confessors who have
   sealed their testimony with their blood! And that testimony is still
   with us this day! Search God's Word and if we teach you anything that
   is inconsistent with it, then reject us as we would have you reject all
   false teachers! If we set before you anything which is of ourmaking,
   and not of God's making, cast it to the dogs and have none of it! But
   if it is God's Truth, be established in it. Garner it in your soul.
   Hold it fast as for dear life and never let it go! Believe that the
   Truth of God as it is in Jesus, is worth the blood which martyrs have
   shed in its defense--and will be worth all that it can possibly cost
   you in holding it! May you be established in every good word--not
   merely in some good words--but in every good word! Believe all the
   Truths of God. Many Christians, alas, believe only one Truth or so. One
   man gets a hold of the Doctrine of Predestination and he is like a
   child with a doll--it is all the world to him! Another man gets a hold
   of the Doctrine of Human Responsibility and he looks at it, as Luther

   says, "like a cow at a new gate." He stands staring at that and can see
   nothing beyond it! But I would have you see all the Truth and be always
   ready to receive anything that God has revealed! Be you steadfast "in
   every good word."

   But the blessing invoked by the Apostle is that you may be established
   in every good work as well as in every good word. Alas, there are some
   Christians who like the Word of God very well, though they do not like
   the work--but unless our godliness extends to our daily work, it is not
   godliness at all! May you, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, be
   established in every good work! May there be the good work of holiness
   in all the relationships of life! May you be the best of sons, the best
   of daughters, the best of parents, the best of husbands, the best of
   wives, the best of employers, the best of employees! Wherever your lot
   may be cast, may you be established in every good work in all the
   relationships of life!

   Then, in this Christian Church, may you work in prayer, may you work in
   teaching, may you work according to the ability which God has given
   you--and may you be established in it! If there is any good work which
   you have not yet attempted, but to which you are called of God, may you
   have Grace to enter upon it and, once engaged in it, may you never take
   your hands from the plow till you have finished the task that God has
   sent you! O Beloved, I can pray this prayer from my heart for everyone
   of you! May you who have served the Master for years, still be kept
   serving Him! Oh, may none of you turn your backs in the day of battle!
   May you be faithful unto death and so obtain the great reward! May the
   Grace which has helped you forward up to now, impel you forward till
   your hairs are gray and until you throw yourselves back upon the couch
   of death to sleep with God! So may you be established in every good
   word and work! Every Christian ought to be a member of the established
   Church--I do not mean the church which is established by the English
   law--but the Church which is established by God! Oh, to be established
   by Divine Grace--to be established by knowing what we believe, by
   practicing it--and by being established in that practice! These
   Apostolic good wishes I leave with you--may you inherit them!

   But remember that we must first come to Christ, or these good wishes
   will be only wishes. We must first trust the Savior, or else these
   blessings can never be ours! May Divine Grace bring us to Jesus and
   keep us at His feet--and Divine Grace shall have the praise forever and
   ever!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 THESSALONIANS 2.

   Verses 1, 2. Now we beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto Him, that you be not
   soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word,
   nor by letter from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. In the
   Church of Christ, the teaching has always been that Christ is coming
   quickly and that teaching must never be withdrawn, for He is coming
   quickly, as He said to John in the Revelation. At the same time, this
   teaching has given an opportunity to certain presumptuous people to
   prophesy that at such-and-such a time, Christ will come. They know
   nothing about it and their prophecies are not worth the breath they
   spend in uttering them! And we have, today, what the Apostle wrote to
   the Thessalonians--

   3. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that Day shallnot come,
   except there comes a falling away, first, and that man of sin be
   revealed, the son of perdition.I believe that to a large extent this
   has already happened and that the "man of sin" has been revealed. This
   "son of perdition" has had a long, dark and terrible reign over myriads
   of men, and he still sits on the seven hills of Rome, and rules over
   multitudes of his fellow sinners. Paul held that it was consistent to
   expect the Lord to come quickly and yet to know that certain events
   must occur before He did come. That is just the condition, I think, to
   which a man's mind will come if he diligently and impartially reads the
   Scriptures--especially the prophetic parts of them. The Lord will come
   in such an hour as we think not, yet there are clear indications of
   certain things which are to happen before He does come.

   4. Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that
   is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing
   himself that he is God. It has been said that the Pope of Rome is
   infallible, that his interpretation of Scripture, whatever it may be,
   is as valid as the Scripture, itself, and that whatever he chooses to
   decree must be obeyed by the faithful. Such are some of the
   pretensions, even at this day, of the "man of sin."

   5-7. Do you not remember that when I was yet with you, I told you these
   things? And now you know what is restraining, that he might be revealed
   in his time. For the mystery of iniquity is already at work.There were
   certain rea-Volume 56 www.spurgeongems.org 7

   sons why that gigantic iniquity should begin to be developed, even
   while the Roman Empire was in power to keep it in check. And when that
   passed away, there was the opportunity for "the mystery of iniquity" to
   become the despot of the world!

   7-10. Only He who now restrains will do so until He is taken out of the
   way. And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord shall
   consume with the breath of His mouth and shall destroy with the
   brightness of His coming. The coming of the lawless one is according to
   the working ofSatan with allpower and signs andlying wonders, and with
   all unrighteous deception among those who perish because they received
   not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. This is the last
   sin of all--that ungodly men do not receive "the love of the truth." If
   they were, themselves, true, they would love the Truth of God. If the
   Grace of God was in them, His own precious Truth would be prized by
   them above everything else! But when men finally reject the Truth by
   which they might be saved, God visits them with terrible judgments!

   11-17. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
   they should believe a lie: that they all might be

   damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasured in
   unrighteousness. But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you,
   brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God has, from the beginning,
   chosen you to salvation through sanc-

   tification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: whereunto He called
   you by our Gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which
   you have been taught, whether by word or our epistle. Now our Lord
   Jesus Christ, Himself, and God, even ourFather, which has loved us,
   andhasgiven us everlasting consolation and good hope through Grace,
   comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work So
   may it be, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

Christ the Creator

   (No. 3180)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 13, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 7, 1873.

   "All things were created by Him and for Him." Colossians 1:16.

   THERE can be no mistake as to the Person concerning whom Paul is
   writing under the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit--it is Jesus of
   Nazareth, the Incarnate Son of God who was crucified on Calvary for,
   writing concerning the same Person in the 14th verse, the Apostle says,
   "In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of
   sins." It is, therefore, that Savior whose blood was shed for His
   people's redemption who is here declared to be the Creator of all
   things and by whom all things consist!

   The first verse of the Book of Genesis tells us that, "in the beginning
   God created the heavens and the earth," so someone may ask, "How do you
   reconcile that statement with Paul's declaration that all things were
   created by Christ and for Him?" No reconciliation is needed, for the
   two statements are identical, as Jesus is God, and "in Him dwells all
   the fullness of the Godhead bodily." Jesus said, "I and My Father are
   One," and so they are! We know not how it is, but the Father, the Son
   and the Holy Spirit are distinct Personalities, yet there are not three
   Gods, but only one, as the Apostle John writes, "There are three that
   bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit; and
   these Three are One." The one God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is the
   Father, Son and Spirit--Three in One and One in Three!

   The subject I have to speak about is the honor and glory of the Second
   Person of the blessed Trinity, even our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!
   But it is so vast a theme that the preacher, at the outset, confesses
   that the task is too great for him to accomplish! He staggers beneath
   the weight of his theme which seems to him too great for the human mind
   to compass or for human lips adequately to express! All I can hope to
   do is to be lost in my subject that Jesus Christ may be

   All-in-All.

   The text tells us that all things were created by Christ and for Him,
   so we will, first, consider Paul's statement. And, secondly, we will
   review the rejections arising from it.

   I. First, then, let us CONSIDER PAUL'S STATEMENT--"All things were
   created by Him and for Him." So, first of all, Heaven, itself was
   created by and for Christ Jesus. Then there is such a place, as well as
   such a state, and of that place Jesus is the center! There is such a
   place, for Enoch is there. "Enoch walked with God: and he was not, for
   God took him." God took him bodily to some place--and that place is
   Heaven. Elijah is also there--the horses of fire and the chariots of
   fire took not merely his spirit, but the entire Elijah--and he is in
   Heaven. Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has gone back to Heaven, went there
   in His own body. When He passed into the skies, He went up into the
   heavenly places, as well as into the heavenly state--and there He lives
   at the right hand of God, even the Father, enthroned in the New
   Jerusalem, the Holy City of God--

   "See how the Conqueror mounts aloft,

   And to His Father flies!

   With scars of honor in His flesh,

   And triumph in His eyes!

   There our exalted Savior reigns,

   And scatters blessings down--

   His Father well rewards His pains,

   And bids Him wear the crown."

   God, absolutely considered as a pure Spirit, needed no such place as
   Heaven. God is everywhere! Long ago He asked, "Do not I fill Heaven and
   earth?" The idea of there being needed any celestial court or place of
   abode falls short of the true idea of the Omnipresent Jehovah. Neither
   do I suppose that it would have been necessary to have a place for
   angels, for the holy spirits would have been able to behold the face of
   God everywhere--wherever they might be, there they would see God and,
   consequently, no special place would have been needed to be set apart
   for them! But it was ordained, in the eternal purpose of God, that
   there should be created a race of beings who should not be pure
   spirits, but who should have bodies made of material substances. And it
   was resolved by Jesus Christ that He would become one of these
   beings--that He would take upon Himself their nature and would become,
   in fact, a Man! Now, when a spirit becomes linked with a material
   substance, it must have a place in which to dwell and, therefore,
   Heaven was created both for Christ and for His people. When the Son of
   Man shall come in His Glory, He will say to those on His right hand,
   "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
   from the foundation of the world." Prepared, that is, with this
   view--that there might be a special central place for the display of
   Christ's Glory--and that all His people might be there with Him. These
   are His own words--"Father, I will that they, also, whom You have given
   Me, be with Me where I am, that they may behold My Glory." They are not
   merely to be as He is, but to be with Him where He is and, therefore,
   Heaven was created by Him and for Him--and for His people who are
   vitally united with Him!

   O Beloved, when we get to Heaven, we shall see that everything there
   glows with the Glory of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! The print of
   His pierced hands will be upon everything. The city of pure gold was
   created by Him and created for Him. The foundations of the walls of the
   city were garnished with all manner of precious stones by Him and for
   Him. The jasper, sapphire, emerald, beryl and all the rest--and the
   gates of pearl are all for Him--all shall be to His glory! For Him each
   harp of gold, each palm of victory, each shout of victory, each song of
   adoration--all Heaven shall ring with the praises of Jesus! Heaven
   shall be, as it were, set with mirrors and every one of which you will
   be able to see a reflection of the glorious Person of Jesus Christ,
   even as in every dewdrop you may see the image of the sun. Everyone in
   Heaven will feel it to be his bliss to praise Jesus! Towards the august
   Throne of the Most High this anthem will triumphantly ascend, "Worthy
   is the Lamb who was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and
   strength, and honor, and glory and blessing!" And with the variation of
   which John tells us in the Revelation, "Blessing, and honor, and glory,
   and power be unto Him that sits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb,
   forever and ever."

   There will be nothing in Heaven that will be derogatory to Jesus, but
   everyone and everything there will be to His praise and glory! I cannot
   believe that any of His chosen people will be missing on the Last Great
   gathering Day. No David's seat will be empty there! No Thomas will be
   absent then! I cannot conceive of one whom He has purchased with His
   precious blood being lost! Not one sheep or lamb will be missing from
   the great Shepherd's flock in the day when they pass under the hand of
   Him that counts them--they shall all be there! The army of the Great
   Captain of our salvation shall be complete there! When the muster-roll
   is read, they shall all answer to their names--and all who are gathered
   there will owe their salvation to the Lamb who was slain! There will
   not be one Pharisee there to boast, "God, I thank You that I am not as
   other men are." There will not be one atheist there blasphemously
   shouting, "There is no God!" Nor one Unitarian seeking to drag Christ
   from the Throne that is rightly His--but all will be adoring and
   magnifying, and delighting to adore and magnify Him by whom and for
   whom Heaven itself was created--

   "All the chosen of the Father, All for whom the Lamb was slain, All the
   Church appear together, Washed from every sinful stain!"

   Next, all angels were created by Jesus and for Him. However great and
   strong, and swift they are, there is not one angel that ever flies from
   Jehovah's Throne that was not created by Christ! Read the whole verse
   from which our text is taken--"For by Him were all things created that
   are in Heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether
   they are thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all
   things were created by Him and for Him." If there are rank upon rank of
   blessed spirits, "that do His commandments, hearkening unto the voice
   of His word," all were created by Him and for Him! Gabriel was sent to
   foretell Christ's coming to earth. Angels announced His birth at
   Bethlehem. Others of them ministered to Him in the wilderness and in
   Gethsemane. They watched over His empty sepulcher and joyfully

   attended Him as He returned to Heaven as the victorious King of Glory!
   It is written that He was "seen of angels," and it must have been with
   awe and wonder that they gazed upon Him from the manger to the tomb! We
   read, also, "which things the angels desire to look into"--and there
   must have been many mysteries which even their lofty intelligence could
   not comprehend until He explained it to them! They delight to praise
   and worship Him! And they help to swell the mighty chorus of adoring
   homage that is always ascending to Him--

   "Bright angels, strike your loudest strings,

   Your sweetest voices raise!

   Let Heaven and all created things

   Sound our Immanuels praise!' Angels were created by Christ and for
   Him--not merely to admire and adore Him, but actually to serve Him.
   Truly did the Psalmist write, "who makes His angels spirits; His
   ministers a flaming fire." And Paul reveals a most important part of
   their service when he asks, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent
   forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" We will
   not enter into any speculations about their battles with evil spirits
   on our behalf, though we believe that this is one of the many ways in
   which they minister for us. We cannot describe all the service that
   these heavenly messengers render to the Lord's own people. I remind you
   of how one of them killed 185,000 of Sennacherib's army in a single
   night! And of how the Prophet Elisha, besieged by the Syrians in
   Dothan, saw the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire for his
   protection. You will recall many other instances of angelic
   interposition and you know, too, how it is written, "He shall give His
   angels charge over You, to keep You in all Your ways. They shall bear
   You up in their hands, lest You dash Your foot against a stone."

   As for the fallen angels who rebelled against God and who have sunk
   forever into hopeless alienation from Him-- even these were created by
   Christ and for Him! And though they hate Him, they shall be compelled
   to obey Him and to acknowledge that He is Lord over all! Even their
   malice against the people of God shall only draw out His love toward
   them and manifest His vigilance, wisdom and power on their behalf. In
   the wilderness the Son of Man met "the prince of the power of the air"
   in mortal conflict. Evil stood there endowed with all the attributes it
   could desire to have upon its side--evil ancient with long and varied
   experience, evil backed up by a powerful angelic intellect, evil with
   ferocious malice glaring in its eyes--evil with diabolic cunning
   tempting the Son of God to sin! There, too, stood the Prince of
   Life--alone, yet undaunted--the Incarnation of holiness and love! Three
   times they wrestled, foot to foot, but the tempter had to retire
   beaten. And when he came again, hoping to take the Son of God and Son
   of Man at a disadvantage in Gethsemane--when He was full of anguish and
   was shortly to die in still greater agony on the Cross--it was again a
   desperate struggle, but the Master flung him to the ground! Our Samson
   tore the old roaring lion as if he had been a kid, and left him
   prostrate and defeated, while He passed on to complete the great work
   of His people's redemption and to conquer all the powers of darkness
   before He gave up the ghost! Glory be to Jesus! He has gotten Glory to
   Himself out of the devil and all his angels!

   And even Hell, itself, terrible as it is, was created by Christ as a
   necessary part of the moral government of the universe so that sin
   might not go unpunished. Even there Christ reigns! His Sovereignty is
   supreme down to its lowest depths. He has the keys of Hell and of
   death--and when the appointed time comes, He will send an angel with
   the key of the bottomless pit and bid him lay hold on "the dragon, that
   old serpent, which is the devil and Satan," and bind him for a thousand
   years and cast him into the bottomless pit. And then, after the
   Millennium, and Satan has been again loosed for a little season, he
   shall be "cast into the Lake of Fire and brimstone, where the beast and
   the false prophets are--and shall be tormented day and night forever
   and ever." Christ is King even over that dark sad part of His domains!
   And amidst all the confusion and tumult of the Pit, His enemies shall
   "confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father."

   The verse from which our text is taken also reminds us that this world
   was created by Christ and for Christ. "By Him were all things created,
   that are in Heaven, and that are in earth." John tells us, "in the
   beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by
   Him: and without Him was not anything made that was made." The eternal
   Logos was the Creator of this lower world as well as of the realms on
   high! There is neither hill nor valley, sparkling fountain nor foaming
   sea which He has not made.

   "The sea is His and He made it: and His hands formed the dry land."
   Truly is He the Creator of this earth! It was formed for Him as well as
   by Him!

   It was especially made to be the place of residence for His people, the
   place on which they would fall through sin and the place on which they
   would be restored through the redemption accomplished there by Christ
   Jesus on the Cross of Calvary. This world was created by Christ as the
   place where He, Himself, would live and labor--and suffer and die. He
   would be laid as a Baby in an earthly manger. As a Boy and a Man He
   would walk through the streets and lanes of this world! He would fare
   as human beings fared and suffer as the dwellers upon the earth
   suffered, though never through any sin of His own. I might truly say
   that the whole world was created for Calvary. "Why leap you, you high
   hills?" That little mound outside Jerusalem's gate explains your very
   existence! The world itself was created that Christ might die on
   Calvary! This earth was to be a sort of stage upon which Christ was to
   take the principal part in the greatest drama that the whole universe
   has ever witnessed! The world was made by Him and for Him--and it will
   remain until His great purpose of love and mercy is fully accomplished!

   We must not forget that even the lower orders of Creation were made by
   Christ and for Him. They were needed by man--and man was necessary to
   the completeness of Christ's plan of Salvation--so the lower forms of
   creatures are links in the chain that could not be spared. There is a
   wonderful sympathy between the various portions of Creation, as the
   Apostle Paul tells us, "for we know that the whole creation groans and
   travails in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves,
   also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we groan within
   ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our
   body." Treat all creatures kindly, then, as far as you can, for the
   great Creator's sake. I would not have a sparrow needlessly killed, nor
   even a worm trod on that might be spared. My Lord and Master made them
   all--and when I look at them, I see traces of His wonderful wisdom and
   power! And when I see how bountifully He provides for them, I note the
   tokens of His goodness and care. He opens His hands and satisfies the
   desire of every living thing! There is not a little bird that picks up
   a seed by the roadside that was not created by Christ and for Him! And,
   perhaps, answers its end better than some of you who lift your brows to
   yonder Heaven only to defy your Maker! There is not an animal upon the
   common, nor a lion in the forest, nor a fish in the sea, nor a fowl in
   the air that was not made by Him--and that does not in some way promote
   His Glory!

   And to come to ourselves, men were created by Christ and for Him.
   Perhaps the Creator resolved to manifest His power and skill in a new
   order of created beings. He had made pure spirits and He had made
   material substances. He had created various forms of life rising from
   the vegetable to the animal. But He resolved that there should be a
   spirit created that would be affiliated with materialism and that this
   spirit should, in the end, when it had passed through all its
   graduations, become the most wonderful creature in the whole
   universe--a creature that should know evil, not merely by report, but
   by actual personal experience--a creature that would, after that, be
   delivered from the power of evil and so should be bound to God by ties
   of gratitude so strong that it would never revolt from Him again! This
   creature, knowing evil and knowing good, strengthened by Divine Grace,
   would, of its own free will, cling to the good and eschew the evil--and
   would forever be God's best ally against all revolt in His
   dominions--for this creature, though it had known evil, was to become a
   child of God and to be a partaker of the Divine Nature, having escaped
   the corruption that is in the world through lust. These creatures,
   partly spiritual and partly material, were to have at their head,
   Christ Jesus, who was to be the model of them all! And they were to be
   like He and to be His companions forever! But they were to be to Him
   more than companions--to be His friends with whom He might hold
   familiar conversation and to be to Him even more than friends--to be
   united to Him in personal relationship--to be so completely one with
   Him that they should be "members of His body, of His flesh, and of His
   bones," that His life should be their life and that their life should
   be derived from Him!

   What a wonderful creature a man will be when He gets to Heaven with His
   body, soul and spirit all complete! No other creature will be so near
   to God as man will be through his union to the God-Man, Christ Jesus
   the Lord! Yet this glorified man will never presume upon his position,
   but will always keep his proper place. He will have been so trained and
   educated by his falls, his regeneration and his redemption that he will
   be always humble, and yet will rejoice that he is a son of the Most
   High who may say to Him, "Abba, Father." I do not know how such a
   creature as a perfect man could have been made by God except through
   the fall in Eden, the birth of Christ at Bethlehem and His death on
   Calvary. In making man, God had produced a new type of being, that in
   him, Jesus Christ might find an opportunity of displaying

   His wondrous condescension in taking upon Himself man's nature--and His
   wondrous Grace in taking upon Himself man's sin and dying in his place!
   Through glorified men becoming Christ's companions, friends and
   faithful servants by reason of His mysterious union with them, a new
   race of beings has been created who can have greater sympathy with God
   than any others of His creatures can have. Devils can have no sympathy
   with God, for they are only evil. The holy angels cannot have as much
   sympathy with God as man who has fallen by sin and then been saved by
   Divine Grace! It is of those who have washed their robes and made them
   white in the blood of the Lamb, that it is written, "Therefore are they
   before the Throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple: and
   He who sits upon the Throne shall dwell among them." He will be our God
   and we shall be His people! He will be our Father and we shall be His
   children forever and ever!

   But oh, if you reject the Savior! If you turn the wondrous opportunity
   of immortal glory which God presents to you in the Gospel, into the
   dread alternative of eternal wrath--if you are resolved that you will
   not be among those privileged beings who will be next to God, Himself.
   If you spurn the dignity that is held before you. Then, notwithstanding
   all that, you will have to glorify Christ! Even in this life and
   against your own will--you shall scarcely know how--you shall be made
   to subserve Christ' s purpose! And at the last He will make you realize
   how terrible He is as He breaks you in pieces as a potter's vessel! If
   you will not touch His silver scepter of Mercy, you shall feel the
   weight of the iron rod of His inflexible Justice! If you will not lie
   at His feet as a penitent, you shall be driven from His Presence into
   the outer darkness where there will be weeping, and wailing, and
   gnashing of teeth forever! God grant that none of you may ever know
   experimentally what this means!--

   "You sinners, seek His Grace,

   Whose wrath you cannot bear!

   Fly to the shelter of His Cross

   And find salvation there!'

   II. Now I must pass on briefly to REVIEW THE REFLECTIONS ARISING FROM
   THIS STATEMENT--"All things were created by Him and for Him."

   And the first clear reflection from this declaration is, then, Jesus is
   God. If all things were made by Him and for Him, how is it possible for
   us to get away from the conviction that He is, indeed, God? I will not
   attempt to argue about the matter, but whatever others may say or do,
   as for me, Jesus of Nazareth is my Lord and my God--and I will love and
   adore, and worship Him forever and ever!

   The second reflection is that Jesus is the key of the universe--its
   center and its explanation. Creation and history are enigmas which can
   only be understood in the light of the Cross. When we look at the
   planets, their motions seem irregular from our standpoint. But if we
   could stand in the sun, we would see the planets revolving in their
   orbits in an orderly manner around it. Calvary is the sun of the
   universe! Stand there, believe in God making Propitiation for sin by
   the death of His Son, and you can understand everything in the light
   that streams from Calvary! Get away from that great center and you
   understand nothing. The great question to ask concerning everything
   is--Will it glorify Christ? How will it affect His infinitely wise
   designs?

   Try, beloved Friends, wherever you are, to see all things in the light
   of Christ. I think this will teach you not to look with scorn upon any
   of the things that are around you. See how the Lord Jesus has purged
   all things for His people so that they shall no longer be common or
   unclean. That lovely river, those fertile valleys, that dense forest,
   yonder snow-clad Alps and everything else that Christ has created, you
   need not say, as some have done, "I will not gaze upon the beauties of
   Nature, lest they should take my thoughts away from my Master." Scorn
   not His works, lest you should also scorn the great Maker of them! His
   are the mountains. And the valleys are His--sun, moon and stars all
   shine to His praise and glory! Go up and down, then, in the world and
   be not troubled by many things that now disquiet you. Say, "I do not
   know how this will glorify Christ, but I am persuaded that in some
   mysterious way which I cannot yet fully comprehend, His eternal
   purposes are being accomplished." See Christ in everything and see
   everything in the light of Christ!

   And, Beloved, another clear inference from Paul's declaration is that
   to live to Christ is to live as we ought to live. If He made us for
   Himself, then we who live unto Him have found out the true purpose of
   our existence! Put a thing to a wrong purpose and it is a failure. But
   use it for the purpose for which it was made and it will answer that
   end. Christian, Christ made you for Himself! Yes, He has twice made you
   for Himself! Therefore lay yourself out for Him--body, soul

   and spirit--spend all your time, and all your strength, and all your
   means for Him and Him alone! So you will be in accord with the great
   purpose of your creation.

   If we do not live unto Christ, we have to make the sorrowful reflection
   that we are out of gear with all things that He has made. Although by
   the mysterious working of His Divine Power, He will get glory out of
   us, yet we are not consciously in harmony with Jesus and all discords
   must have an end. All opposition to Omnipotence must be futile and must
   also be transient. However long He may allow evil to continue, there is
   an end even to His long-suffering patience! And then, woe be to those
   who are still at enmity against the Almighty!

   Another reflection from the text is that we can only live for Christ as
   we live by Christ We cannot glorify Him except as He gives us the Grace
   to do so--if we attempt to do it by our own power, we shall most
   certainly fail. Wait at His Cross, Beloved! Cry to Him to give you the
   aid of His almighty Spirit and then, through the effectual working of
   the Holy Spirit, you shall be able to live for Jesus, alone, by whom
   and for whom you were made both at your first creation and also when
   you were created anew in Christ Jesus!

   And, lastly, it is clear from all this that Christ must triumph. Some
   of us have been almost breaking our hearts as we look around at the
   follies of the generation in which we live. They are going on
   pilgrimages to the shrines of their idols--the gods that are not gods!
   They are bowing down to their priests and confessing in their ears the
   sad stories that should be told only to God! They are setting up the
   calves and images that their fathers worshipped and turning away from
   the only living and true God! All this we mourn and grieve over, but
   let us not imagine that Christ's true Kingdom is suffering loss!
   Beneath the dark clouds that hide the sun, we mourn the absence of the
   great orb of day, but think how brightly the sun is shining above those
   clouds! Borrow an eagle's wings and soar above the clouds, and then you
   shall see the sun shining in his strength. So is it with Christ, the
   Sun of Righteousness! Get away, by faith, from this poor earth, and you
   shall see Him shining in His Glory, whether it is day or night, summer
   or winter! Christ must reign. "The kings of the earth set themselves,
   and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord, and against His
   Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder and cast away their
   cords from us." But it is still true, "Yet have I set My King upon My
   holy hill of Zion." And He shall reign forever and ever, and let all
   His people say, "Hallelujah!" And again and again cry, "Hallelujah!"

   He must reign. What power is there that can stand against Him who
   created all things? What arm can dare to be lifted up against His
   almighty arm? Be of good courage, you soldiers of the Cross! Dream not
   of defeat, nor think for a moment of fleeing from the foe in terror.
   Victory must come to the Lamb that was slain! He shall come from Edom,
   with dyed garments from Bozrah. His apparel shall be red, like the
   garments of him that treads in the wine vat, for all His enemies shall
   be trodden down in His wrath! And Rome, the harlot church, the chief of
   all His foes, shall be hurled down like a millstone into the flood and
   sink to rise no more--

   "He shall reign from pole to pole

   With illimitable sway!

   He shall reign when, like a scroll,

   Yonder heavens have passed away!

   Then the end--beneath His rod,

   Man's last enemy shall fall!

   Hallelujah! Christ in God,

   God in Christ is All-in-All."

   Happy is he who is the lowliest page in the retinue of such a King!
   Happy is he who shall be privileged to sprinkle a few drops of water to
   lay the dust in the road over which our conquering King shall ride!
   Blessed is he who shall spread his garments in the way, or wave a palm
   branch in honor of the royal Victor in His triumphal procession! Happy
   shall he be, then, who has been laughed to scorn for Christ's sake! Or
   who has been lying in a dungeon till the moss has grown on his eyelids!
   Or who has been burned at the stake and his ashes cast to the four
   winds of Heaven because he would not deny his Lord! Oh to be wholly on
   His side, now, that we may be among His faithful followers on that Day!
   Here we are, O glorious Son of David! Take us and all that we have, and
   make us more than ever Yours from this time forward, and unto You shall
   be the glory forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON:

   COLOSSIANS1.

   Verses 1, 2. Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
   Timothy, our brother, to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ
   which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father
   and the Lord Jesus Christ Kindness is the very breath of Christianity,
   so the Apostle will not begin the subject matter of his letter until
   first of all he has breathed out a benediction upon those to whom he
   writes.

   3. We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   praying always for you Paul very graciously blends his giving of thanks
   and his constant prayer for these Christians at Colosse and, therein,
   sets us an example that we may well imitate.

   4-6. Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
   which you have to all the saints, for the hope which is laid up for you
   in Heaven, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the
   Gospel, which has come unto you, as it has, also, in all the world and
   is bringing forth fruit, as it has also among you, since the day you
   heard of it, and knew the Grace of God in truth. If there is a way of
   knowing the Grace of God which is of no value, it is when it is not
   known in truth, that is to say, when it is only head-knowledge, not
   heart-knowledge. But, oh, when in truth the Grace of God sinks into the
   soul and changes the whole nature, then it is an experience for which
   we may well give thanks to God!

   7, 8. As you also learned ofEpaphra our dear fellow servant, who is for
   you a faithful minister of Christ; who also declared unto us your love
   in the Spirit. Epaphras told them of Paul's prayers for them and when
   he came back from Colosse, he told Paul of their great love in the
   Spirit.

   9. For this cause we, also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
   pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge
   of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. [See Sermon
   #1742, Volume 29--spiritual knowledge AND ITS PRACTICAL RESULTS.] See,
   the Apostle asks even more

   for them than faith, hope and love--that they "might be filled with the
   knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding." This
   shows what a valuable thing it is to know and understand the will of
   God!

   10, 11. That you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
   fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
   strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, unto all
   patience and long-suffering with joyfulness. If we have faith, hope,
   and love, it is desirable that we add to these a fullness of
   knowledge-- and to this holiness of life and fruitfulness of
   service--that we may have patience to endure the afflictions of this
   life and long-suffering with which to put up with the provocations of
   the ungodly.

   12-14. Giving thanks unto the Father who has made us meet to be
   partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who has delivered
   us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the Kingdom of
   His dear Son: in whom we have redemption through His blood, even the
   forgiveness of sins. And now Paul, having mentioned his Master's great
   work--redemption by blood and the forgiveness of sins--goes on a
   tangent, as it were. He is so enthusiastic with regard to Christ and
   His great atoning Sacrifice that the very thought of Christ's blood
   stirs his own blood and he seems like a man all on fire with holy
   fervor as he writes--

   15-17. Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every
   creature: for by Him were all things created that are in Heaven, and
   that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they are thrones, or
   dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him
   and for Him: and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist
   How can anyone ever read this passage and yet say that Christ Jesus is
   only a Man? By what twisting of words can such language as this be
   applied to the most eminent Prophet or Apostle who ever lived? Surely
   He must be God by whom all things were created, and by whom all things
   consist! But Paul's next sentence is, to us, the sweetest of all--

   18. And He is the head of the body, the Church. [See Sermon #839,
   Volume 14--THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH.] He is joined by an indissoluble
   union to His people and is the Head of their glory, their wisdom and
   their strength!

   18. Who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; that in all
   things He might have the preeminence. Are we giving Him the preeminence
   in all things? That theology must be false which puts Jesus in the
   second place, or even lower than that! And that experience is a wrong
   one which does not put Christ always in the front. He must in all
   things always stand first!

   19. For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell
   [See Sermons #978, Volume 17--all fullness in christ and

   #1169, Volume 20--THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST THE TREASURY OF THE SAINTS.]

   That we might have to go to Him for it, it pleased the Father to make
   errands for us so as to take us to Christ and to thus make our very
   emptiness to minister to the Glory of Christ!

   20-23. And having made peace through the blood of His Cross, by Him to
   reconcile all things unto Himself; by Him, I say, whether they are
   things in earth, or things in Heaven. And you that were sometime
   alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has He
   reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy
   and blameless and above reproach in His sight--if, indeed, you continue
   in the faith grounded and steadfast This is a text that ought to be
   read and pondered every day by the many unstable professors who are in
   the Church at this present time-- "if, indeed, you continue in the
   faith grounded and steadfast," like a building that will have no
   further settling, no more splitting of the stones, no more cracking of
   the walls--because your foundation is secure and you are firmly built
   upon it!

   23, 24. And are not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you
   have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under
   Heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister; who now rejoices in my
   sufferings for you Oh how blessed it is when a man has so mastered
   himself that his sufferings for his fellow Christians become a matter
   of rejoicing for himself! He not only accepts them and bears them with
   patience, but he says--

   24. And fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my
   flesh for His body's sake, which is the Church. There is nothing
   "behind" as to the atoning efficacy of the sufferings of Christ, but
   there is much yet to be endured in order that all the elect may be
   brought to Christ. Some must suffer through their extraordinary labors
   in preaching the Gospel, others through bearing reproach for the Truth
   of God's sake--and Paul was glad to take in his mortal body, his share
   of the sufferings to be endured for the sake of Christ's Church--which
   is His mystical body.

   25-27. Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from
   God which was given to me for you, to fulfill the Word of God, the
   mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is
   made manifest to His saints: to whom God wouldmake known what is the
   riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ
   in you, the hope of glory [See Sermon #1720, Volume 29--CHRIST IN YOU.]
   This is the most blessed of all mysteries! I trust that many of us
   understand it--may the Holy Spirit reveal it to any who know it not!

   28. Whom we preach. That is, Christ. It is not so much what we preach
   as whom we preach. We preach the Person of Christ--"whom we preach"--

   28, 29. Warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that
   we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also
   labor, striving according to His working, which works in me mightily.
   [See Sermon #914, Volume 16--

   WORK IN US AND WORK BY US.] There will never be any mighty work

   come from us unless there is first a mighty work in us--no man truly
   labors for souls unless the Holy Spirit has first worked mightily in
   him.

A Sermon for a Winter's Evening

   (No. 3181)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of
   coals, for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood
   with them, and warmed himself." John 18:18.

   WE note from this incident that it was a cold night in which our
   Redeemer agonized in the Garden of Gethsemane.

   [See Sermon #2767, Volume 48--JESUS IN GETHSEMANE.] A cold night and

   yet He sweat! A cold night and yet there fell from Him, not the sweat
   of a man who earns the staff of life, but the sweat of One who was
   earning life, itself. "His sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood
   falling down to the ground." No natural heat of the sun, or of a sultry
   evening caused this! The heat within His soul distilled those sacred
   drops! His heart's throbs were so mighty that it seemed to empty itself
   and His life-floods rushed with such awful force that the veins, like
   overfilled rivers, burst their banks and covered His blessed Person
   with gory drops! On such a wintry night as this, while you wrap your
   garments about you, I would ask you to remember the olive garden and
   the lone Sufferer, all unsheltered, entering into the dread anguish by
   which He won our souls from death and Hell! The sharp frost may be a
   useful monitor to us if it makes us think of Him and remember that
   dark, that doleful night when all the powers of evil met and, even unto
   blood, He strove with them for our sakes!

   Now we will take you away from the Garden to the high priest's hall
   where the incident occurred which is regarded in the text--and we will
   make as good a use as we can of it. I suppose it was a large dark hall
   in which the soldiers, the priests and the rabble were gathered
   together. There may have been a few lamps lighting up the far end where
   Christ was with His judge and His accusers. But the greater part of the
   hall would have no other light than the glare of the fire which had
   been kindled--a charcoal fire, around which the band of men who had
   seized Christ and the servants of the high priest gathered to keep
   themselves warm. We are going to make five observations upon that and
   upon the fact that Peter was among those who warmed themselves at that
   fire.

   I. The first observation is this. THIS IS A TYPICAL INCIDENT AS TO THE
   MOST OF MEN.

   Jesus Christ was being tried. Some were very busy about it, being full
   of malice and burning with rage. But a great many more were
   indifferent--and in the Presence of a rejected and maltreated Savior
   were carelessly warming their hands. It was not a matter that
   interested them. They did not care whether He escaped or was
   condemned--it was very cold and so they warmed their hands. Now, in a
   land like this, where Jesus Christ is preached, it is a sad
   circumstance that there are individuals who oppose Him and His Gospel.
   There is the infidel who denies the Gospel altogether. There is the
   superstitious man who sets up another way of salvation. And there is
   the persecutor who rages at Christ and His people. Yet these active
   enemies are comparatively few--the great bulk of those who hear the
   Gospel are not open opponents-- but like Gallio, care for none of these
   things. They know that there is a Christ and they have some idea of His
   salvation, but it does not interest them, or awaken any sympathy in
   their minds. "What shall we eat and what shall we drink?"-- these are
   the great questions of their catechism! But as to who this glorious
   Sufferer is and why He died, and what are the blessings which He bought
   with His precious blood--none of these things move them--and they
   forget, neglect, or despise the great salvation and the Savior, too!
   They are full of the business of warming their hands! The death of
   Jesus may be important to other people. It may concern ministers,
   clergymen and professors, but it is nothing at all to them. They have
   other matters to attend to and their own comfort is their main concern.
   Around that charcoal fire the servants of the high priest warmed their
   hands and so, in their temporal comforts, or in murmuring at the lack
   of them, the most of

   men spend their lives. To them it is nothing that Jesus should die! A
   rise in their wages, a fall in provisions, or a change in the money
   market is far more important to them!

   If you think of it, this is a very terrible thing. Christ came into the
   world to save men, yet men do not think it worth their while to turn
   their gaze upon Him! He takes their nature, but His Incarnation does
   not interest them. He dies that men may not perish--and men care not
   one whit for His great love! One goes away to his farm and another to
   his merchandise. One has bought a yoke of oxen and goes to test them.
   Another has married a wife and, therefore, he cannot come. They are
   eager for the bread which perishes, but they make light of the meat
   which endures the everlasting life! They think much of this world, but
   nothing of the world to come. Jesus is over yonder at His trial and
   they are warming their hands!

   I pray you think this over a few minutes, any of you who have been
   indifferent to the great realities of redemption, and see what it is
   and who it is that you thus treat with discourtesy. It is the Son of
   God, the Redeemer of men, whom you neglect! Can you imitate those who
   rattled the dice-box at the foot of the Cross, in utter hardness of
   heart, though Christ's blood was falling upon them as they cast lots
   for His clothes? Can you trifle in the Presence of a dying Savior? Can
   you, did I say? Alas, some have done so for thirty, forty, fifty and
   even 60 years! And unless the almighty Grace of God prevents, they will
   continue to trifle, still--to sport, play and seek their own welfare in
   the Presence of the bleeding Son of God, within earshot of His dying
   groans!

   Look, He dies and they place His body in the sepulcher! But on the
   third day, according to His promise, He rises again from the dead! That
   risen Savior is surrounded by the glory of unspeakably precious
   promises, for He has risen for the justification of His people and as
   the first fruits of them that slept--the great pledge that all those
   who sleep in Him shall rise as He has risen! An august mystery--a
   mystery which brought angels out of Heaven, the one to sit at the head
   and the other at the feet, where His body had lain! And yet men eat,
   drink, sleep and wake as if no risen Jesus had been here! In the
   Presence of the risen Christ many only warm their hands, for it is
   cold. The animal has mastered the mental. The body, which is the baser
   part of man, and cleaves to the dust, has subdued the soul, and so the
   man allows himself to trifle in the Presence of Jesus risen from the
   dead!

   Nor is this all, for He that rose from the dead ascended after 40 days!
   A cloud received Him out of the sight of His disciples and He rose into
   Glory and now He sits at the right hand of the Father, reigning there,
   head over all principalities and powers--King of kings and Lord of
   lords! Men do not generally trifle in the presence of a king. If they
   have petitions to present, they put on an air of reverence. In the
   Presence of the Royal Intercessor who pleads for us day and night, one
   would think there would be some interest excited! But no, the multitude
   warm their hands and think nothing of Him. In His Presence, they forget
   His redeeming love, neglect His great salvation and remain without God
   and without Christ. This is terrible! As I see the worldling merely
   caring for his personal comfort while Christ is in Glory, I marvel,
   first, at the insolence of the sinner and, secondly, at the Infinite
   Patience of the Savior!

   The Lord Jesus is to come a second time to judge the earth in
   righteousness. When He shall appear, no man knows, but come He
   will--and everyone of us must stand before Him. If we are alive and
   remain, we shall join in that great throng. And if we fall asleep
   before His coming, we shall rise from the dead at the sound of the
   trumpet which proclaims His Advent--and shall all be judged of the Most
   High. The hour of His appearing is not revealed in order that we may
   always stand on tiptoe, expecting it to be today, or tomorrow, for He
   has said, "Behold, I come quickly." Oh, how can you still be
   money-grubbing, pleasure-seeking, enjoying yourselves, living only for
   this world, living to got a competence, living to be what is called,
   "respectable," and to feed yourselves like the beasts of the field?
   Have you no thoughts for the Judge and the day of His coming? Shall our
   immortal spirits spend all their energies on these trifling temporary
   things in prospect of that great tremendous Day when Christ with clouds
   shall come? Surely the solemnities of judgment should constrain us to
   think of something nobler than earth and time!

   There was no harm in their warming their hands, neither is there any
   harm in our attending to the things of this life. Indeed, they ought to
   be seen to, and seen to with care--but there is something higher,
   something nobler and loftier for us to do than to serve ourselves! And
   as it was horrible that we should be so callous in the presence of the
   suffering Jews, so is the widespread indifference of sinners a terrible
   thing! I would to God that the unthinking portion of those who hear the
   Gospel might be startled out of their groveling care for the things of
   this life and each one of them be led to ask, "What have I to do with
   this Jesus of Nazareth? Is His blood sprinkled upon me? Has He cleansed
   me from my sin? May I

   hope for salvation through Him?" Oh, consider these things and give an
   answer to your consciences! And God do so with you as you shall think
   of Christ, your Lord.

   II. Secondly, we remark that FOR A DISCIPLE TO MAKE HIS OWN COMFORT THE
   CHIEF THING IN THE

   PRESENCE OF HIS SUFFERING MASTER IS MOST INCONSISTENT.

   One does not wonder at the high priest's servants making a fire of
   coals, for it was cold--and one is not surprised at their standing to
   warm their hands, for they knew but little, comparatively, of Christ.
   They had never tasted of His love, they had never seen His miracles,
   they had not been asked to watch with Him in the Garden of Gethsemane,
   they had never heard Him say, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona, for
   flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you." The marvel is that Peter
   should stand there among them warming his hands! Why did he do so? Not
   because he was indifferent to his Master. Let us do him justice--it is
   plain that he was in a dreadful state of mind that night. He was so
   attached to his Master that he followed Him up to the door of the hall
   and stopped there till John came out and admitted him. He went up to
   the fire because he thought he must act as others did, so as to escape
   suspicion. And as they warmed their hands, he did the same, so as to
   appear as one of them. It so happened, however, that the light of the
   fire shone upon his face and lit up his countenance, so that one said,
   "You are one of His disciples." Then, to get away from observation, we
   find Peter passing into another part of the hall, where, I suppose, it
   was darker. The people were talking and Peter must talk, for it was his
   weakness to do so, and, moreover, he might have been suspected again
   had he been silent. Then another remarked, "You also are of Galilee,
   for your speech betrays you." He was discovered, again, and so made for
   the door, but was known there, also. He was all in a tremble. He did
   love his Master, weak as his faith was and, therefore, he could not
   leave Him--and yet he was afraid to confess Him. He was worried and
   troubled, tossed to and fro between a desire to rush forward and do
   some rash thing for his Lord--and a fear for his own life! He went to
   the fire because nobody would think that a follower of Jesus could warm
   his hands while his Master was being despitefully entreated.

   You see the gist of my observation, that for a disciple of Christ to
   make his own ease and comfort the main thing is most palpably
   inconsistent with the Christian character! Ah, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, our Lord had not where to lay His head. Though He was rich,
   yet for our sakes He became poor--can it be consistent for the
   Christian to make the getting of money the main business of life? Is
   such a disciple like his Master? The Master gives up everything--shall
   the disciple labor to aggrandize himself?

   Some warm their hands, not at the fire of wealth so much as at the fire
   of honor. They want approbation, respect, esteem--and they will do
   anything to gain it. Conscience is violated and principle is forgotten
   to gain the approbation of their fellow men. Whatever happens, they
   must be respected and admired. Is this as it should be? Are they really
   disciples of the Nazarene? Is that their Master, despised and rejected,
   spit upon and jeered? Is He their Lord who made Himself of no
   reputation? If so, how can they court the smiles of men and sacrifice
   the Truth of God to popularity? What can be more inconsistent than the
   disciple warming his hands and the Master enduring the contradiction of
   sinners against Himself? Dear Brothers and Sisters, every time our
   cheek crimsons with shame because of the taunts of the wicked and we
   lower our colors because of the jeers of the godless, we are guilty at
   heart of the meanness of seeking to fare better than our Lord! Every
   time we check a testimony because it would involve us in censure, every
   time we stay from a labor because we covet ease, every time we are
   impatient at the suffering which the Cross involves, every time we
   "make provision for the flesh, to obey the lusts thereof," every time
   we seek ease where He toiled, honor where He was put to shame and
   luxury where He endured an ignominious death--we are like Peter among
   the ribald throng--warming our hands at the fire while our Lord is
   buffeted and shamefully entreated! May the Holy Spirit keep us from
   this!

   III. We now come to our third observation. IT IS MUCH BETTER TO BE COLD
   THAN TO WARM OURSELVES WHERE WE ARE EXPOSED TO TEMPTATION.

   Peter, if he had known it, was better off outside the door than in the
   hall. I suppose he had forgotten the Master's warnings, for if he had
   thought of them, he would have said to himself, "Peter, you had better
   go home. Did not Jesus, in fact, tell you to go home when He said to
   those who came to seize Him, 'If you seek Me, let these go their way'?"
   It would seem to have been the path of humble obedience to have gone
   his way and not to have pressed into the hall. Though no doubt the
   motives which led both Peter and John into the high priest's house were
   commendable, Peter's position among the soldiers and hangers-on around
   the fire was extremely full of peril and offered no corresponding
   advantages. Did he not know that "evil communications corrupt good
   manners"? Did he not know that the men who had taken his Lord prisoner
   were not fit associates for him? Should he not have felt that though he
   might have his hands warmed, he would be likely to get his heart
   blackened by mixing with such company?

   Brothers and Sisters, I like to warm my hands, but if I cannot warm
   them without burning them, I would rather keep them cold! Many things
   are in a measure desirable, but if you cannot obtain them without
   exposing yourself to the smut of sin, you had better leave them alone.
   I have known professors far too anxious to mix with what is called,
   "good society." Now, for the most part, good society, as things are,
   nowadays, is very bad society for a Christian. The best society in the
   world for me, I know, is to associate with my Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ. Title, rank and wealth are a poor compensation for the lack of
   true religion! Yet some professors covet the honors of the ungodly
   world and they say, "It is not so much for ourselves--we are advanced
   in years--but we want to bring the girls out, and our young men, you
   know, our sons must have some society." Yes, and for the sake of this
   dangerous luxury our churches are deprived of successors to godly
   fathers! Instead of seeing the younger members of Christian households
   drafted into our ranks, we have continually to begin again with new
   converts from the outer world. Full often professors who God prospers
   in this world so train their children that they forsake the spiritual
   worship of God and turn their backs on principles for which their
   forefathers dared to bleed and die! I charge you, Brothers and Sisters,
   remember that if you cannot be admitted into "society" without
   concealing your principles, you are far better off without society! Has
   not our Lord called us to go outside the camp? Are we not warned
   against being conformed to this world? Deny yourselves the warm place
   around society's charcoal fire, for its sulfurous vapor will do you
   more harm than the cold!

   Some whom I have known have ventured very far upon very dangerous
   ground to win the affection of a chosen object. There is no wiser
   precept in Holy Scripture than that which commands Christians to marry
   "only in the Lord." It never can conduce to take comfort of any
   Christian man or woman to be unequally yoked together with an
   unbeliever-- you had far better remain in the cold of your bachelor or
   spinster life than warm your hands at the fire of unhallowed marriage!

   Not a few are tempted by the cleverness of certain literature to defile
   their minds with skeptical and even blasphemous writings. Such-and-such
   a "Quarterly" or, "Fortnightly," is so very clever that you are
   regarded as a Philistine and an ignoramus if you do not read it! Yet if
   you do read it, you are never the better, but very much the worse for
   your pains--why, then, yield to its more than doubtful influence? Do
   you pray the better for such reading? Have you more faith in God after
   perusing such works? No, but doubts which would not otherwise have
   occurred to you are sown in your mind, difficulties which only exist in
   ungodly brains are conjured up--and the time which ought to have been
   spent in devotion and in growing in Grace, and in bringing others to
   Jesus--you waste in battling for the very life of your faith which you
   have needlessly exposed to assault! I do not believe it to be essential
   to roll in a ditch every day for the sake of proving the efficacy of
   the clothes brush! Neither is it worthwhile to seek out infidel doubts
   in order to try our logical powers upon them! Some tell us that we must
   keep abreast of the times, but if the times run the wrong way, I see no
   reason why we should run with them! Rather let us leave the times and
   dwell in the eternities. If I can be cheered and refreshed by good
   literature, and be the better and wiser for it, I am thankful. But if I
   must, in warming my hands, defile them with unbelief, I will sooner let
   them become blue with cold!

   Perhaps, dear Friends, our liability to be injured by that which
   renders us comfortable is one reason why God does not subject some of
   His best people to the trials of prosperity. Have you not sometimes
   wished that you were rich? I daresay you have. But perhaps you never
   will be. You did prosper, once, but it came to an end. Once or twice
   the prize of wealth seemed within your reach--others seized it--and you
   are still working hard and earning a bare crust. We do not know what
   you might have been if you had been allowed to succeed. In warming your
   hands you might have burned them. Many Christians have been
   impoverished by their wealth and brought to inward wretchedness by
   outward prosperity. You have flourished best in the soil in which the
   Lord has kept you--anywhere else you might have run to seed. Some years
   since, when the first larch tree was introduced into England, the
   person who had brought home the specimen put it into his hothouse to
   grow. It did not flourish, and no wonder, for it delights in a colder
   atmosphere! The gardener therefore pulled up the spindly thing by the
   roots and threw it upon the dunghill! And there, to everybody's
   surprise, it grew wonderfully! It was created to flourish under trying
   circumstances--and perhaps you are of the same order. Learn the lesson
   and be content to be where you are!

   IV. A fourth observation is this--IF A CHRISTIAN ACTS INCONSISTENTLY,
   HE IS PRETTY SURE TO BE FOUND OUT.

   Here was Peter warming his hands and he thought that nobody would know
   him--but his face, as we said before, was illuminated by the light of
   the fire and one said, "Surely you are one of His disciples." The fire
   did not merely warm, but it threw light on him and showed him up. And
   so, when it comes to pass that a Christian gets into association with
   the ungodly and figures with them, his sin will find him out. I have
   noticed, in a very wide sphere of observation, that bad men may do
   wrong for years and not be discovered--and that hypocrites may contrive
   to carry on their hypocrisy half a lifetime without being unmasked. But
   a true man, a real child of God, if he shall only do a tenth as much
   wrong as others, will be certain to be detected! Peter tried to look
   uncommonly comfortable and calm while at the fire, but he could not do
   it. He revealed himself by the twitches of his face and the very look
   of him! And when he spoke, as we have already said, the tones of his
   voice betrayed him. A Philistine helmet will not sit well upon an
   Israelite! He wears it awkwardly and is known, though in disguise. Ah,
   Christian, you had better keep to your own company--it is of no use for
   you to try to travel incognito through this world, for it will detect
   you! Never go where you will be ashamed to be seen, for you will be
   seen. A city set on a hill cannot be hid! A lighted candle must be
   seen. A speckled bird will be noticed where no note is taken of others.
   Worldlings have lynx eyes with which to spy out erring professors--and
   they are sure to publish your faults for they are sweet morsels to
   them! "Report it! Report it!" they say. In vain will you try to pass
   yourself off as a stranger to Christ--your speech will betray you and
   the finger of scorn will be justly pointed at you for your
   inconsistency! Therefore, keep to your own company and walk not in the
   way of the wicked.

   V. The fifth point is this--and you all know it to be true--IT IS A
   GREAT DEAL EASIER TO WARM YOUR

   HANDS THAN YOUR HEARTS.

   A few coals in a fire suffice to warm Peter's hands, but even the
   Infinite Love of Jesus did not, just then, warm his heart. O Sirs, what
   was the scene at the end of the hall? Was not that enough to set all
   hearts aglow? It was a bush that burned with fire and was not consumed!
   It was the Son of God struck on the mouth and vilely slandered--and yet
   bearing it all for love of us! O Sirs, there was a furnace at the other
   end of the hall--a furnace of Divine Love! If Peter had but looked at
   his Master's face, marred with agony, and seen upon it the mark of His
   terrible night's sweat, surely, had his heart been right, it would have
   burned within him! One marvels that with such a sight before him--if
   Peter had been Peter--if he had only been true to that true heart of
   his, he would have braved the malice of the throng, placed himself side
   by side with his Lord and said, "Do to me whatever you do to Him. If
   you smite Him, smite me. Take me and let me suffer with Him." If he
   might not have done that, one would not have wondered if Peter had sat
   there and wept till he broke his heart to see his Master treated so!
   But alas, the sight of his Lord, accused and betrayed, did not warm
   Peter's heart.

   My Brothers and Sisters, we sometimes wish that we had actually seen
   our Lord, but seeing Christ after the flesh was of small service to
   Peter. It was when the Holy Spirit used the glance of Jesus as a
   special means of Grace that Peter's heart was thawed and his eyes
   dropped with tears of repentance! O Lord and Master, though a bodily
   sight of You would not warm us if You should walk up these aisles and
   should show Your pierced hands in this pulpit. Yet, if Your blessed
   Spirit will come upon us tonight, we shall see You by faith and the
   sight will make our hearts burn within us, though it is winter! Come,
   sacred Spirit, shed abroad the love of Jesus in our souls and so shall
   our love be kindled, and burn vehemently! Grant it, therefore, we pray
   You, for Your love's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN18:1-27.

   Verse 1. When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His
   disciples over the Brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which He
   entered, and His disciples. From our Lord's example, we should learn,
   when trouble is near, to meet it with composure. Our Savior did not sit
   still, but, as the hour approached for His betrayal and death, "He went
   out with His disciples." The passing over the black Brook Kidron,
   through which flowed the filth of the Temple, was very significant.
   King David had crossed that brook long before when he had been driven
   from his home by Absalom's rebellion--and now the Greater David went
   "over the Brook Kidron, where was a garden." He especially wanted
   solitude, just then, for one of the best preparations for suffering is
   to get alone with God. Learn this lesson, also, from your Lord's
   example and, as He put Gethsemane before Calvary, if you can put an
   hour of prayerful contemplation before your expected suffering, it will
   be a great help to you.

   2. And Judas, also, who betrayed Him, knew the place: for Jesus
   ofttimes resorted there with His disciples. That dark and gloomy olive
   garden was no pleasure garden that night! It had often been a place of
   retirement and of prayer for the Master. What happy memories His
   disciples must have had of being with Him there for a season of prayer!
   It was a very choice privilege for them to be with Him when He
   preached, but it must have been, if possible, a still greater privilege
   to be with Him when He prayed. It is not recorded that His disciples
   ever said to Him, "Lord, teach us how to preach," but at least one of
   them was so struck with His prayers that he said, "Lord, teach us to
   pray." We may well ask Him to do that for us now. Perhaps some of you
   would like to be taught how you can become great--it is much more
   important for you to be taught to become prayerful!

   3. Then Judas, having received a detachment of men and of officers from
   the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches and
   weapons.It does not matter much about the band of men and officers with
   lanterns and torches and weapons, but the dreadful part of the
   narrative is that they were led by one who had been a disciple of
   Christ, one who had been numbered with the Apostles! Is Christ still
   betrayed by His professed friends? Yes, it is so, but may you and I
   never be guilty of that terrible crime! Yet why should we not unless
   the Grace of God should prevent it? We are of the same flesh and blood
   as Judas--and although we might not be tempted by a sum of money, we
   may be tempted by a sinful pleasure or by a sinful shame. Lest we
   should be led astray, let us pray that we may not enter into temptation
   and especially ask that we may be preserved from betraying our Lord as
   Judas did.

   4. Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that should come upon Him, went
   forth and said to them, Whom are you seeking?Because of His Divinity,
   He knew all that would come upon Him, but what a wondrous Manhood His
   was that although He knew all that would befall Him, He went forth calm
   and composed, resigned to His Father's will and said to those who had
   come to seize Him, "Whom are you seeking?" I think He is saying to some
   of us, "whom are you seeking?" We have not come here to slay Him. We
   have not come here to fight against Him and lead Him away to crucify
   Him. Yet I hope that we can truly say that we have come seeking Jesus.
   If this is really your heart's desire, it shall surely be fulfilled to
   you!

   5. They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said unto them, I am H.
   Or, rather, "I Am," pronouncing the words with a Divine dignity which
   had a startling effect upon them.

   5, 6. And Judas, also, who betrayed Him, stood with them. As soon,
   then, as He had said to them, I am He, they went backward and fell to
   the groundIt seems as if our Lord intended to let them realize
   something of His Divine Power and Glory, for the utterance of that
   august expression, I Am, which is His Father's name, staggered them and
   they fell to the ground. Do you not wonder that they did not rise up
   and go away and leave Him after they had fallen at His feet and asked
   His forgiveness? They did not act so, for the power of fear, when it is
   not accompanied by love, is very small. There was enough power in it to
   make them fall down to the ground, but there was not power enough in it
   to make them fall at Christ's feet confessing their sin!

   7, 8. Then He asked them again, Whom are you seeking? And they said,
   Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am He: if,
   therefore, you seek Me, let these go their way. [See Sermons #2616,
   Volume 45--christ's care of his disciples and #2368, Volume 40--THE
   LIVING CARE OF THE DYING CHRIST.] It is

   very cheering to us to think of our Lord meeting all the enemies of His
   people, gathering up all their weapons into His own heart, that His
   people might go free. You and I, if we had been in such a case, would
   have been hurried and worried--and our fears would have made us
   selfish--we would have forgotten our poor friends who were with us! But
   Jesus thought not of Himself--He thought of His poor trembling
   disciples and, therefore, He said, "If, therefore, you seek Me, let
   these go their way."

   9. That the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, Of them which You
   gave Me have I lost none. He had only said that just a little while
   before, but this verse shows us that the New Testament is as sure to be
   fulfilled as the Old Testament. It was a new saying, not then written,
   yet it had all the life and power of God in it! So it must live and
   must be fulfilled.

   10. Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high
   priest's servant, and cut offhis right ear. The servant's name was
   Malchus. Here is every prospect of a fight! Simon Peter has begun it
   and the armed men will be eager to continue it. We always have our
   Simon Peters about--men of emotion, men of impulse, men of impetuosity.
   They are not a bad sort of Christians and I do not know what we would
   do without them. Our cold, frozen thinkers would not do much without
   our warm-hearted Peters to help to thaw them! Still, Peter was only one
   of the 12 Apostles and though they call him the head of the church, he
   made a very poor head of the church just then! He drew a sword and
   began to use that carnal weapon by cutting off the right ear of
   Malchus! It was a great mercy that the Lord was there to heal the ear
   and to forbid the use of the sword in His defense.

   11. Then Jesus said unto Peter, Put your sword into the sheath.
   Shalllnot drink the cup which My Father has given Me?Here is another
   helpful lesson for any of you who have a trial before you. Do not seek
   to set the trial aside--use no wrong means to escape from
   affliction--drink your ordained cup! Though Peter's sword is handy, put
   it up into its sheath and do not use it. Bear and forbear, on and on
   and on to the end of the chapter! Drink the cup that your Father gives
   you. However bitter it is, it is sweetened by the fact that He gives it
   to you! Shall not a true son of God drink the cup that his Father
   presents to him? There can be no harm in it and it must work you some
   real good--so put up your sword and lift the cup to your lips--and
   drink it to the dregs.

   12. Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus
   and bound Him. When you are bound with sickness, or bound with
   weakness, or bound in any other way, do not complain. Your Master was
   bound and I think we ought to be willing to be anything that Christ
   was. What was good enough for Him is good enough for us. "They took
   Jesus and bound Him."

   13. 14. And led Him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to
   Caiaphas, who was the high priest that same year. Now Caiaphas was he
   who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should
   die for the people. Christ could not die without the question of
   expediency turning up. I never knew any great sin in the world, nor any
   great heresy, nor any great combination of men to maintain it without
   the question of expediency coming under consideration. Expediency is
   the great Christ-killer! Many, nowadays, say to us, "Do not preach
   against error--it is not expedient to do so. Do not break away from
   evil associations--it is not expedient." How many there are of even
   good men who do certain thing, not because they are right, but because
   they are expedient! But, Believers in Jesus, in the name of your Lord I
   implore you to hate expediency, since it put Jesus to death! It was a
   wicked expediency that would murder Christ in order to save a nation!
   But it did not really do so, after all, for the guilt of slaying Christ
   brought upon the nation the growing crime of Deicide.

   15. And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that
   disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with Jesus into the
   palace of the high priest. This other disciple was, no doubt, John, who
   thus veiled himself as he did on other occasions.

   16. But Peter stood at the door outside. It would have been better for
   him if he had stayed there--he would probably have been more out of the
   way of temptation than he was inside the palace of the high priest.

   16. Then went out that other disciple, who was known to the high priest
   and spoke unto her whom kept the door, and brought in Peter. John
   doubtless acted thus out of kindness to Peter, but he was the means of
   bringing his friend into a place where he was not strong enough to keep
   his feet. You and I may act like that, perhaps, in perfect innocence
   and even with commendable kindness--yet we may be unintentionally doing
   our friends a great wrong! I notice that John seems to have been the
   first of the Apostles to associate with Peter after that terrible fall
   of his. And in his record of Peter's denial of his Lord, he does not
   mention his cursing and swearing as Matthew and Mark do. He appears to
   have felt great tenderness towards Peter--perhaps all the more so
   because he had been the innocent means of getting him into the place of
   temptation.

   17. Then said the damsel who kept the door unto Peter, Are not you,
   also, one of this Man's disciples? He said, I am not. Ah, Peter! Ah,
   myself! If anyone is trusting in himself, he may soon utter a lie
   concerning his Lord as Peter did. Keep us, O God, by Your Grace, or
   else it will be so with us. It was nothing but a poor maidservant that
   cowed this brave Peter--the man whose sword was drawn just now in his
   Master's defense is not able, truthfully, to answer the maid's
   question, "Are not you, also, one of this Man's disciples? He said, I
   am not."

   18. And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of
   coals, for it was cold: and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood
   with them and warmedhimself.'While his Lord and Master was being
   maltreated and abused over yonder at the end of the hall, Peter was
   warming himself at the servant's fire. Ah, he was getting cold
   spiritually while warming himself physically! And it sometimes happens
   that when men are warming their bodies, they are at the same time
   cooling their hearts. I have known a man warm himself at a very big
   fire through coming into possession of a large amount of property--but
   he has also grown very cold, spiritually, for these coals of fire do
   not warm the heart.

   19-21. The high priest then asked Jesus of His disciples and of His
   doctrine. Jesus answered Him, I spoke openly to the world. I always
   taught in the synagogue, and in the Temple, where the Jews always
   resort; and in secret have I said nothing. Why do you ask Me? Ask them
   which heardMe, what Ihave said unto you: behold, theyknow what
   Isaid.Our Lord's teaching was never deceptive. He did not say one thing
   and mean another. He could truly appeal to His hearers concerning His
   teaching. It is a great thing for a preacher to be able to feel that
   his hearers know what he has said to them. We cannot always say that,
   for some of them forget and some of them do not understand what we say.
   Some of them do not give sufficient attention to know what it is that
   is said, but Christ's preaching was so clear and plain that He could
   truly say, "Ask them which heard Me, what I have said to them: behold,
   they know what I said."

   22, 23. And when He had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by
   struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Do you answer the high
   priest so? Jesus answered him-- Not as Paul did, "God shall smite you,
   you whited wall." The Master is superior to the disciple at all points.
   Jesus said--

   23. If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why
   did you strike Me?Let us pray that whenever we are despitefully
   treated, we may keep our temper and be as composed as our Lord was. And
   if we must make an answer to our accusers, let it be as discreet and as
   justifiable as this answer of our Lord's.

   24, 25. Now Annas had Him sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest. And
   Simon Peter stood and warmed himself John thus resumes the narrative
   concerning Peter from the 17th verse--"Simon Peter stood and warmed
   himself."

   25. They said, therefore, to him. Two or three or more of them speaking
   at a time said to him--

   26-27. Are not you, also, one of His disciples? He denied it and said,
   I am not. One of the servants of the high priest, being the kinsman
   whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did not I see you in the garden with
   Him? Peter then denied it again. Ah, me, they who lie once will be all
   too apt to lie again! Those who deny Christ once will be apt to go to
   still greater lengths in their denial of Him. May they be stopped as
   Peter was!

   27. And immediately the cock crew. May the cock crow for some who have
   been asleep up till now--and warn them that the night is far spent and
   that it is time for them to awake out of sleep--and wash their eyes
   with tears and repent of having denied their Lord!

Boldness at the Throne

   (No. 3182)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 27, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 14, 1873.

   "Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace." Hebrews 4:16.

   [Another sermon by Mr. Spurgeon, upon the same subject, is #1024,
   Volume 17--"The Throne of Grace."]

   PRAYER occupies a most important place in the life of the Christian.
   "Behold, he prays," was one of the first and also one of the surest
   indications of the conversion of Saul of Tarsus. No one begins to live
   the life of faith who has not also begun to pray--and as prayer is
   necessary at the commencement of the Christian career, so is it
   necessary all through. A Christian's vigor, happiness, growth and
   usefulness all depend upon prayer. It is--

   "His watchword at the gates of death, He enters Heaven with prayer." I
   suppose that even there we shall continue to pray. At all events, we
   read of the souls under the altar crying with a loud voice and saying,
   "How long, O Lord, holy and true, do You not judge and avenge our blood
   on them that dwell on the earth?" I imagine that in Heaven we shall
   still lift up our hearts in prayer for the spread of Christ's Kingdom,
   though our principal occupation there will be that of praise. But
   prayer is always needed here--every day, every hour, every moment we
   have cause for crying unto the Most High--

   "Long as they live should Christians pray," for only while they pray do
   they truly live!

   It is because of the supreme importance of prayer that we find so much
   about it in the Scriptures. The Holy Spirit continually encourages us
   to pray by precept, promise and example. One conspicuous instance of
   that encouragement is the exhortation we are now to consider--"Let us
   therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace."

   So, coming at once to the text, notice that we have here, first, a
   description of our great resort for prayer--"The Throne of Grace."
   Secondly, we have a loving exhortation--"Let us come unto the Throne of
   Grace." Thirdly, we have a qualifying adverb, telling us how we are to
   come--"Let us come boldly'" Fourthly, we have a reason given for
   boldness. The reason is in the context. We shall also think of other
   reasons and then shall close with the reason upon which Paul laid the
   stress of the argument in writing to the Hebrews--"Let us therefore
   come boldly unto the Throne of Grace."

   I. First, then, dear Friends, we have A DESCRIPTION OF OUR GREAT RESORT
   FOR PRAYER--"The Throne ofGrace."

   Under the Law of God, there was to be an ark overlaid inside and
   outside with pure gold. And above the ark was to be the Mercy Seat of
   pure gold with the golden cherubim covering the Mercy Seat with their
   wings. This mysterious emblem no one ever saw except the high
   priest--and he saw it only once a year--and then but dimly, for he saw
   it through the smoke of the incense which he presented before the Lord.
   It was a secret thing, but now it is revealed to us, for the veil has
   been torn and the symbol taken away that we may now come boldly right
   up to the Throne of heavenly Grace.

   I was conversing, some time ago, with a member of the Catholic and
   Apostolic Church who took great pains to instruct me as to the meaning
   of the various offices and ordinances of the body with which he was
   connected. After he had explained a great many mysteries to his own
   satisfaction, if not to my edification, he pointed out the position of
   the saints at the present day. And then I felt that it was time to
   answer him, so I said, "I do not believe that Christians are intended

   to go crawling about the outer court and keeping far off from the Holy
   Place, for the Apostle Paul said, 'Let us therefore come boldly unto
   the Throne of Grace,' right into the Holy of Holies, for there is no
   longer any separating veil to keep us away from the Mercy Seat. As a
   believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, my place is not in the outer court,
   nor even in the court of the priests. I have advanced beyond them and
   come right up to the Throne of Grace that I may there obtain mercy and
   find Grace to help in time of need." That is the position of all true
   Christians, not only on one day of the year, but every day!

   I wish that all Believers could realize the privileges to which they
   were born when they were created anew in Christ Jesus. You may have
   heard a whole congregation saying, "Lord, have mercy upon us and
   incline our hearts to keep this Law," and you may have seen them all
   shivering there at the foot of Sinai with the lightning flashing above
   them, and the thunder pealing around them! Yet it is possible that at
   least some of them may have had the right to come before the Lord as
   His own dear children through faith in Jesus Christ. And if so, they
   might have said to Him, "Lord, You have had mercy upon us. You have
   blotted out all our transgressions and now we are not under the Law,
   but under Grace, and are completely delivered from the thralldom of the
   old Covenant of Works and are put under the new Covenant of Grace, that
   we may serve You in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the
   letter." Blessed are they who are enjoying the liberty wherewith Christ
   makes His people free and who, therefore, come boldly right up to the
   Throne of Grace!

   The Mercy Seat, then, is where the high priest typically came once each
   year. But our Great High Priest, "by His own blood entered in once into
   the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption for us." As He died,
   He tore down the separating veil and threw the Holiest of All open to
   all who believe in Him! And He has made them kings and priests unto
   God, so that where the high priest stood, is where they stand in Christ
   Jesus! That place is so solemn and awe-inspiring that we might fear and
   quake at the very thought of coming to it were it not for this and
   other similar exhortations, "Let us therefore come boldly unto the
   Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in
   time of need."

   Our Mercy Seat is called "a throne" because we come there to God as a
   King and we, by faith, behold Him in His excellent glory and majesty.
   He is our Father and our Friend, but He is also "the King eternal,
   immortal, invisible," so we approach even the Throne of Grace with the
   deepest awe and reverence. We come to this Throne with the utmost
   confidence, for God gives as a King and, therefore, we ask largely and
   expectantly! John Newton caught the very spirit of this verse when he
   wrote--

   " You are coming to a King, Large petitions with you bring! For His
   Grace and power are such, None can ever ask too much."

   It is a Throne of Grace where no ordinary monarch presides, but where
   One is sitting who is Infinite and All-Sufficient, One who can bestow
   upon us more than we ask, or ever think of asking, and yet not
   impoverish Himself in the slightest degree! Always remember, Beloved,
   in coming to the Mercy Seat, that you are coming to a King and to One
   who gives like a King! Always open your mouth wide and ask great things
   of the King who is so ready to bestow them upon you!

   In drawing near to God in prayer, we come to a King who sits upon a
   Throne of Grace. That word, "Grace," is one of the choicest in the
   whole description of our great resort for prayer. We might well have
   trembled if we had been bid to come to a throne of justice! We might
   have been afraid to come to a throne of power, alone. But we need not
   hesitate to come to the Throne of Grace where God sits on purpose to
   dispense Divine Grace! It would be terrible if we had to pray to a just
   God if He were not also a Savior--if we could only see the awful glare
   of Sinai without the blessed attractions of the Atonement made on
   Calvary! If we can see the "rainbow round about the Throne, in sight
   like unto an emerald," the token of God's Covenant Love and Grace, then
   we can pray very differently from the way in which we would pray if we
   could only see the naked sword of Divine Justice brandished to and fro
   to keep us back from the holy God who would not have His peerless
   Majesty polluted by our sinful presence! Let us always remember that
   when we pray aright, we deal with God on terms of Grace--and answers to
   our petitions come to us not according to what we deserve, but
   according to His Infinite Mercy and Grace in Christ Jesus our Lord!

   It is also very comforting to us to observe that the God who hears
   prayer is enthroned and glorified. The God of Grace sits upon the
   Throne of Grace and so Grace reigns supreme at the place where God
   meets with us in prayer! The

   hands of Grace are full of blessings through the atoning Sacrifice of
   Jesus Christ--and those hands are happily employed in dispensing royal
   largess among the poverty-stricken sons and daughters of men! Come
   here, then, all you who feel your need of Grace! Be not afraid to
   approach the Throne of Grace. Since Jesus Christ has taken upon Himself
   our nature and suffered in our place, the Throne to which the sinner is
   bid to draw near is a Throne of superlative, unlimited, reigning
   Grace--Grace that pardons, Grace that regenerates, Grace that adopts,
   Grace that preserves, Grace that sanctifies, Grace that perfects and
   makes meet for Glory! Happy is the preacher whose privilege it is to
   invite sinners to come to such a blessed meeting place with God, but
   happier far will be the sinners who shall have the Grace to come to
   that meeting place! May many here be among them!

   II. Now, secondly, we have A LOVING EXHORTATION--"Let us come unto the
   Throne of Grace." Who is it that gives this exhortation? Why did he put
   it in this form? We might have expected the exhortation to be simply,
   "Come boldly unto the Throne of Grace." Or even, "Go boldly unto the
   Throne of Grace." But it is put in the form of an invitation from
   someone who urges us to go with him--who is this?

   Well, first, it is from Paul who had, himself, proved the power of
   prayer. "Paul? Have I not heard his name before?" Oh, yes! "But had he
   not once another name?" Yes, his name was Saul. "Then, surely, that
   must have been the man who persecuted the saints of God, who was
   exceedingly mad against them and against the Christ whom they loved
   more than they loved their own lives." Yes, that is the man! Only he
   has been so changed by Divine Grace that he is a new man in Christ
   Jesus! And now he confesses that he was the chief of the sinners whom
   Jesus came to save. It is this saved sinner who is now a saint of God,
   an Apostle of Jesus Christ and who writes to his fellow Believers, "Let
   us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace." I think that I can
   summon up courage to go to the Mercy Seat in such company as this! If
   the chief of sinners is going to the Throne of Grace, I, also, may go!
   Under another aspect I may be the chief of sinners, too, and if so,
   there will be a pair of us and we will go together!

   Yes, it was Paul who gave this exhortation. A man of like passions with
   ourselves who was once as great a sinner as any of us have ever been.
   He puts out his hand to us and he says, "Come along, Brothers and
   Sisters--let us go boldly to the Throne of Grace." When he gave this
   exhortation, Paul had become an experienced Believer who had often gone
   to the Throne of Grace and there proved the power of prayer. He was no
   stranger at the Mercy Seat. He had done much heavenly business with his
   Master there--so now, having proved the power of prayer--he does not
   speak as a mere theorist, but as a practical man who had put the matter
   to the test and, therefore, knew that God answered prayer! So he wrote
   to those who had not had such a wonderful experience as his had been,
   to those whose knowledge of Divine things was far inferior to his own
   and, linking himself with them, he said, "Let us come boldly unto the
   Throne of Grace."

   It always does me good to hear an aged Christian talk about the Lord
   Jesus Christ. I recollect, at this moment, a venerable minister who has
   long gone to Glory. I heard him make almost his dying speech. He had
   been blind for many years and when he rose at the Communion Table and
   told us of the loving kindness of the Lord toward him, of how he had
   tried and tested his God in the deep waters of affliction and had
   always found Him faithful--and when he bade us, "Young people, be sure
   to put your trust in the Lord, for He is well worth trusting," he did
   us all good. I think it is in some such way as this that the Apostle
   Paul, a man of deep and varied experience, writes to the Hebrews--and
   through them to us--and says, as one who has tried and proved the power
   of prayer, "Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace."

   It is, however, not only Paul who speaks in this exhortation, but it
   seems to me that this exhortation comes through Paul from the whole
   Church of Christ Paul was a representative man. And as he penned these
   lines, it seems as though the entire Church of God was speaking through
   his words. Even the saints in Glory appear to cry out to us, "Come
   boldly to the Throne of Grace! We can urge you to do so from a
   remembrance of our own experience, for we long ago tried and proved the
   efficacy of prayer in every emergency that we had to face." It is
   certain that all the saints on earth unite in this exhortation, "Let us
   therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace." From many a sick bed
   where aged Christians have been for years pining away--no, I correct
   myself and say--where they have been melting into Glory as the morning
   star melts into the sunlight--from many such a bed whose faith has
   triumphed over physical weakness and pain, I hear the cry, "Let us come
   boldly unto the Throne of Grace." From many a night-watcher compelled
   by terrible pain to lie awake and guard the night with prayer, as the
   sentinels of the Church of God, I hear the cry, "Let us come boldly
   unto

   the Throne of Grace." From many another child of God, who, in the midst
   of activities and trials combined, has daily and hourly to draw his
   strength from the Most High by fervent supplication, I hear the cry,
   "Let us come boldly unto the Throne of Grace." And from many who,
   through prayer, have been enabled to do great exploits in the name of
   Jesus, having cast themselves by faith upon a prayer-hearing and
   prayer-answering God--and who are today the living evidences of what
   Divine Grace can accomplish through human instrumentality--from these,
   also, I hear the cry, "Let us come boldly unto the Throne of Grace."
   The Church militant, with its blood-red banner floating in the breeze,
   marches bravely on to the conflict, crying, "Let us come boldly unto
   the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in
   time of need."

   But I also hear in this exhortation a voice much more powerful than
   that of the Apostle Paul, or even of the whole Church of Christ, for it
   seems to me to come from the Holy Spirit Himself, for Paul wrote as he
   was moved by the Holy Spirit. I think I am not going too far when I say
   that the Divine Spirit, who dwells in all the saints, is now speaking
   through the Inspired page and says to us, "Let us come boldly unto the
   Throne of Grace." Paul wrote to the Romans, "We know not what we should
   pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us
   with groans which cannot be uttered. And He that searches the hearts
   knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He makes intercession for
   the saints according to the will of God." It appears to me that in our
   text the Spirit, speaking in the soft and gentle accents that the
   Comforter delights to use, is not so much bidding us go to the Throne
   of Grace, as promising that He will go there with us! And, surely we
   will go if He will accompany us! As it is His Divine voice that says,
   "Let us come boldly unto the Throne of Grace," let us obey the gracious
   exhortation! This is not the only time that the Spirit and the Church
   of Christ say the same thing, for we read in the Revelation, "The
   Spirit and the bride say, Come." So here the Spirit and the bride both
   seem to me to say, "Let us come boldly unto the Throne of Grace."
   Therefore all you who form part of the mystical bride of Christ, hear
   the Spirit's gentle call--comply with His exhortation and come boldly
   unto the Throne of Grace!

   III. Now, thirdly, we have A QUALIFYING ADVERB--"Let us come boldly
   unto the Throne of Grace." We must not mistake the meaning of this
   word, "boldly." Paul does not say, "Let us come proudly unto the Throne
   of Grace." God forbid that we should do that! Abraham's prayer for
   Sodom and Gomorrah is an admirable model of how we are to come boldly
   unto the Throne of Grace, for although he pleaded again and again for
   the guilty cities of the plain, he said, "Behold now, I have taken upon
   me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes." The greatest
   boldness in prayer is perfectly consistent with the lowest
   self-humiliation.

   Neither must we ever think of coming before the Lord arrogantly or
   presumptuously, for it is to a "Throne" that we are bid to come,
   although that Throne is "the Throne of Grace." I have heard prayers
   that have seemed to me like dictating to God rather than the humble,
   reverent petitions which should be presented by the creature to the
   Creator, or by the children of God to their loving Father in Heaven. We
   are to come boldly to the Throne of Grace, yet always with submission
   in our hearts, even as our Lord, Himself, prayed, "Nevertheless, not as
   I will, but as You will."

   I think that by this adverb, "boldly," is meant that we may come
   constantly--at all times. Eastern potentates would only admit
   petitioners to their presence when they pleased. Though Esther was made
   queen by Ahasuerus, she was not allowed to go near him unless she was
   especially called. But it is not so with us! The path to the Throne of
   Grace is always open--there are no guards to bar the way of those who
   come in the right spirit. There are no set times for prayer--one hour
   is as good as any other for coming to the Throne of Grace. Whenever the
   Spirit of God inclines the heart to pray, the ear of God is open to
   hear our supplications--and the mouth of God is open to grant us
   gracious answers of peace!

   "Boldly" also means that we may come unreservedly, with all sorts of
   petitions. Whatever it is that lies as a burden upon your heart, come
   with it to the Throne of Grace! Do you really need some great thing?
   Then come and ask for it! Or do you need some little thing? Then come
   and ask for it! Have you some care that is crushing you into the very
   dust? Come and leave it at the Mercy Seat! Have you some little care
   that worries you, some thorn in the flesh, some messenger from Satan to
   buffet you? Come and tell your God all about it! Cast all your care
   upon Him, for He cares for you. Think not that God will be angry with
   you for asking too much from Him--and imagine not that you will insult
   Him by asking Him for little things. If you are a believer in Jesus,
   God is your Father, so speak to Him as you would to your earthly
   father--only have far more confidence in coming to Him than you would
   have in approaching the most affectionate earthly parent.

   Further, "boldly," also means that we may come freely, with simple
   words. Do not say, "My words are not good enough to present to God. I
   must get a book of prayers and try to find suitable words with which to
   approach the Most High." Oh, do not it! It is true that in private
   prayer, in family prayer and even in public prayer it is better to use
   a form than not to pray at all. I have often said that it is better to
   walk with crutches than not to walk at all, but what need have you of
   crutches--for that is what forms of prayer really are? Your Father in
   Heaven does not want you to come to Him in a stiff, formal way, but
   just to proclaim, as simply and naturally as possible, the desires of
   your heart. If one of my boys wanted a new suit of clothes, or anything
   else that it was proper for him to have, I would not like him to come
   with a written request, as if he were presenting a petition to
   parliament! I would not feel that he loved me very much if he came in
   such a fashion as that! But when he asks me for what he needs in a
   bold, familiar and yet respectful manner, I am only too pleased to
   supply his needs!

   You who are parents know that you do not make your children offenders
   for a word. When they first learn to talk to you, they pronounce their
   words very imperfectly and make many blunders. They break all the rules
   of grammar and their prattle is often so indistinct that strangers who
   come to your house do not know what they are saying. But you know,
   Mother. You know, Father. You understand them all right and you like to
   hear them talk like that--it is the natural speech for little
   children--and there is the accent of love in it that endears it to you.
   Well, now, go to your God as your little child comes to you! Tell Him
   all that is on your heart. Never mind about your words--use such
   language as your heart dictates--and when you find that you cannot pray
   as you would, tell Him so. Say to Him, "O Lord, I cannot put my words
   together properly, but I pray You to take my meaning, O my Father--do
   not judge my prayer by my broken, faulty speech, but read the desires
   of my heart and grant them if they are in accordance with Your gracious
   will!" Perhaps the best prayers of all are those that have no words at
   all--those that are too deep down in your heart to get shaped into
   words. We hardly know how they got there, except that we believe God
   put them there by His Holy Spirit-- so He accepts them even if they are
   never formed into words!

   "Boldly" means, too, that we may come hopefully, with full confidence
   of being heard. It is not a matter of doubt as to whether God hears and
   answers prayer--if there is any fact in the world that is proved by the
   testimony of honest men, this is that fact! You know that at a trial
   before an earthly judge there are often many witnesses who give their
   testimony as to the facts of the case as far as they are known to them.
   And the weight of their evidence is very largely determined by their
   personal character. Now, if this were the right time and I was the
   counsel in charge of the case, I could bring forward hundreds--even
   thousands of the best men and women who have ever lived--I mean those
   who are admitted to be so by all who know them--honest, straightforward
   witnesses whose evidence would carry weight in any court of law, who
   would calmly and deliberately declare that, over and over and over
   again, God has answered their prayers! Answered them so often that it
   has now become with them a matter of course that when they really need
   anything, to go to God and get it. "Oh," says someone, "that is only a
   delusion! There is no such thing as answers to prayer." No, Sir, you
   have no right to say that, for the witnesses have as much right to be
   believed as you have! Possibly even more, for you may not have the
   character to support your infidel assertion that these witnesses have
   to back up their Christian testimony! We can bring forward men who are
   the equals in learning of any unbeliever, men who are eminent in the
   ranks of literature, men who are masters of scientific knowledge--yet
   these very men have been simple as little children in the matter of
   prayer and they all testify that God has heard them again and
   again--and granted their requests! That is a strange "delusion" which
   is a daily fact in the history of millions and which has been proved to
   be true in the lives of millions who are now before the Throne of God
   on high! So let us still pray knowing that God will hear us and be
   fully persuaded that He will give us whatever is for His own Glory and
   our own and others' good! The Apostle James reminds us that we must
   "ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of
   the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think
   that he shall receive anything of the Lord."

   Once more, this word, "boldly," means that we should come
   perseveringly, with a fervent importunity that will not be denied. If
   at our first coming to the Throne of Grace, we do not get what we want,
   let us come again and keep on coming until we do get it. God sometimes
   makes us wait for a blessing in order that we may value it all the more
   when we do receive it. He would have us ask, and seek, and knock again
   and again--and not be content until we obtain the blessing we crave. If
   we are sure that what we are asking is in accordance with the will of
   God, let us keep on coming like the importunate widow came to the
   unjust judge--until the desire of our heart is granted to us!

   I think this is what is meant by coming "boldly unto the Throne of
   Grace."

   IV. Now, lastly, we have A REASON GIVEN FOR BOLDNESS--"let us therefore
   come boldly unto the Throne of Grace."

   There are a great many other reasons besides the one to which Paul here
   alludes. I will give them to you in brief.

   First, we are invited to pray. God would never have invited us to pray
   if He had not intended to hear and answer us. No right-minded man would
   invite his fellows to a feast and then send them away empty. So, the
   very invitation to us to pray implies that there are blessings waiting
   for us at the Mercy Seat--"Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne
   of Grace."

   Let us remember, too, that Grace is for sinners, and we are invited to
   come to the Throne of Grace. It is only on terms of Grace that we can
   expect to obtain the blessings that we need--but it is to the Throne of
   Grace that we are bid to come. So let the sinner come, for it is the
   Throne of Grace! Let the needy saint come and at the Throne of Grace,
   "find Grace" to help in time of need." Let us all come, good or bad,
   prepared or unprepared, whoever or whatever we may be--let us come
   boldly because it is the Throne of Grace--and Divine Grace is what we
   all need.

   Let us also remember the Character of the King who sits upon the Throne
   of Grace. He is Infinite in mercy and love and He delights to bless His
   creatures. He is Infinite in power and is, therefore, "able to do
   exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think." He is Infinite in
   wisdom and is, therefore, able to give us whatever is best for us in
   the best possible way. He is altogether unlimited in His Nature and,
   therefore, we cannot exceed His power or His willingness to help us,
   let our requests be as large as they may! Oh, when I think of what God
   is as He is revealed in Christ Jesus, and remember that it is He who
   sits upon the Throne of Grace, I feel that I may well repeat Paul's
   exhortation, "Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace!"

   Remember also, O Christian, your relationship to the King who sits upon
   the Throne of Grace! You are not merely His servant--you are His
   child--an heir of God, and joint-heir with Jesus Christ! All that you
   ask for is already yours by right of inheritance and shall be in your
   possession in due time. Shall a child tremble in his loving Father's
   presence? Shall a son act as if he were a slave? Shall I, with
   tremulous hands, present a petition to my own Father whom I love? If I
   have perfect love to Him, it casts out all fear. So, because we are the
   children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, "let us therefore come boldly
   unto the Throne of Grace."

   I have already reminded you that the Holy Spirit has been given to
   teach us how to pray. Now the Holy Spirit knows the mind of God and,
   therefore, He never moves us to pray for anything which God does not
   intend to give us. Prayer is often the shadow of God's coming blessing.
   Before the Divine Decrees are fulfilled, they often cast their blessed
   shadow across the Believer's heart by the power of the Holy Spirit so
   that when the Believer prays in the Spirit, he is only asking God to do
   what He has from all eternity determined to do! If we came to the
   Throne of Grace with petitions which we had ourselves prepared, we
   might well tremble! But when we come with a Spirit-written petition, we
   may well "come boldly unto the Throne of Grace."

   Then, Beloved, there is one sweet thought which should always encourage
   you to "come boldly unto the Throne of Grace," and that is, the many
   "exceedingly great and precious promises" in the Scriptures. If we had
   to ask for unpro-mised blessings, we might come tremblingly. But there
   are promises in God's Word to meet every emergency. "I will never leave
   you, nor forsake you." "As your days, so shall your strength be."
   "Whatever you shall ask the Father in My name, He will give to you." I
   might go on quoting promises by the hour, together, but it will be more
   profitable for you to search them out for yourselves, especially if you
   remember what Paul writes concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, "for all
   the promises of God in Him are yes, and in Him, Amen, unto the glory of
   God by us." These promises are all the more precious to us because they
   are free promises, not made to us because of our merits, but solely
   because of God's Grace! And all the promises are made by that faithful
   God who cannot lie, and by that Almighty God who is as able to fulfill
   the promises as He was to make them! "Let us therefore come boldly unto
   the Throne of Grace."

   If we need any more reasons to encourage us to come boldly to the
   Throne of God, let us remember that God has already given us His dear
   Son, and let us ask again the question that Paul asked so long ago, "He
   that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall
   He not with Him also freely give us all things?" You and I, if we are
   believers in Christ, are already saved with an everlasting salvation!
   Then after God has given us this greatest of all blessings, will He
   refuse to bestow upon us the lesser mercies? Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ, as the Lord has already done

   such great things for us, He cannot turn a deaf ear to our petitions,
   especially when they are inspired by His own gracious Spirit! "Let us
   therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace."

   Besides, some of us have had many years' experience in the power of
   prayer. Some of you have had 50 years of soul-enriching communion with
   God at the Mercy Seat. Do you not remember many times when you were in
   deep trouble and prayer brought you deliverance from it? Do you not
   recollect some seasons of terrible depression of spirit when prayer
   brought the sunlight back to you? Do you not recall that time when you
   were bereaved and when, as you stood weeping by the open grave, prayer
   brought you sweet relief and dried up your tears? Do you not remember
   when you were in poverty and prayer obtained bread for you? The ravens
   did not bring it, nor did a widow sustain you, yet you were fed by the
   God of Elijah in answer to your earnest supplication! What is there
   that prayer has not done for us? Oh, there are multitude of instances
   which come to our memory when prayer has unlocked Mercy's door--and
   they all say, "Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace."

   Now I will close by briefly referring to the reason which the Apostle
   gives why we should come boldly to the Throne of Grace. I have given
   you many good reasons, but this is the best reason of all--"We have not
   a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
   infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
   sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace that we may
   obtain mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need." That is to say,
   we are to come with boldness to the Throne of God because there is
   pleading for us there, a Man who is also God, to whom every petition
   put up by those who trust in Him is a very precious thing which He, as
   the great representative Man before the Throne presents to His Father,
   for He is God's own dear Son! Yes, He is one with the Eternal and His
   will is the will of the Infinite Jehovah to whom we address our prayers
   in Christ' s name! This glorious God-Man Mediator continually presents
   before His Father His one great Sacrifice for sin. There will never be
   a repetition of it and it will never need to be offered again, "for by
   one offering He has perfected forever them that are sanctified," that
   is, those who are set apart unto Himself. This one Sacrifice He
   perpetually pleads before the Throne--and our prayers, therefore,
   ascend to God with the merit of Christ's atoning blood giving them
   acceptance with His Father. So they must have power with God, for they
   come before Him signed, as it were, with the name of His well-beloved
   Son. He lays His hand upon each petition and so leaves the print of the
   nails upon it--and therefore it must prevail with God!

   Remember, too, that this same Jesus Christ was once a Man upon earth
   like ourselves, except that He was "without sin." When your prayer is
   broken through grief, recollect that He also knew what a broken-hearted
   prayer meant. The sighs and tears of Gethsemane taught Him that. He was
   made perfect through suffering that He might perfectly sympathize with
   all His suffering saints. Do not imagine that you can ever get into any
   condition in which Jesus Christ cannot comprehend you and,
   consequently, cannot sympathize with you. If you are in the depths, as
   Jonah was, remember that Jonah was but a type of Christ, who therefore
   knows all about your present experience and also knows how to deliver
   you out of it! If you seem to be altogether deserted by God and know
   not why it is so that you have to cry, "My God, my God, why have You
   forsaken me?" that is an experience through which Jesus, Himself,
   passed. Yet--

   "In every pang that rends the heart The Man of Sorrows had a part'-- so
   that we have, before the Throne of God, a High Priest who is as
   sympathetic as He is powerful! "Let us therefore come boldly unto the
   Throne of Grace."

   Remember, too, that every blessing which you have a right to ask for
   through Christ is yours already, "for all things are yours; things
   present, or things to come; all are yours; and you are Christ's; and
   Christ is God's." Every right prayer that you offer is but putting in a
   claim for that which is rightly yours through your union to Christ.
   Therefore come boldly to the Throne of Grace because you have such a
   Pleader to appear there for you and such a plea to urge with God
   through Him!

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, let us begin to pray more boldly for
   sinners! Let us pray more boldly for London! Let us pray more boldly
   for our country! Let us never cease praying to the Lord to send a great
   revival throughout the whole world! And O, you sinners, you may come,
   too, for it is, "the Throne of Grace" to which we are invited! And it
   is before that Throne that Jesus stands interceding for the
   transgressors. Come and welcome to Jesus Christ! This is your "time of
   need." You are full of sin and need mercy to forgive it and cleanse you
   from it. You are full of weakness and need the help of God. Come to the
   Throne of Grace and ask for His Grace to help you in your time of need
   and you shall surely have it!

   God has not left off being a prayer-hearing and prayer-answering God,
   so come to Him! Yes, let us all "come boldly unto the Throne of Grace,
   that we may obtain mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need."

   What I have been saying to you, I have said far more to myself than to
   anyone else here, for if there is one who needs more prayer than all
   the rest, I am that one, burdened as I am with incessant service and
   overwhelming responsibilities. Yet, after taking to myself more of the
   sermon than I pass on to any of you, I venture to say that there is not
   one person in this building whose condition does not make prayer
   necessary for him. I do not know what the special need of each one of
   you may be, but I think everyone here who seriously thinks about the
   matter, must say, "Well, if there is anybody in this place who can do
   without prayer, I am not the one! I must pray! There is something about
   my case that drives me to the Mercy Seat." Thank God that it is so, but
   be sure that you go to the Throne of Grace that you may obtain the help
   you need.

   It is a blessed trouble that drives us to the Mercy Seat, yet one would
   scarcely wish to have the kind of trouble that Mr. Fraser, a good old
   Scotch minister, had. He had a wife who tormented him dreadfully, yet,
   when someone jestingly said to him that he would not drink to her
   health, he replied, "I hope she will live long, for she has driven me
   to my knees ten times a day when, otherwise, I might not have prayed."
   One would not wish to be driven to prayer in such a fashion as that,
   yet I venture to say that Mr. Fraser was a gainer by it! Real prayer
   must make us more like our Master. "Let us therefore come boldly unto
   the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find Grace to help
   in time of need."

Cheer for Despondency

   (No. 3183)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You know not what a day may bring forth." Proverbs 27:1.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon, upon the whole verse is #94, Volume
   2--TOMORROW.]

   WHAT a great mercy it is that we do not know "what a day may bring
   forth"! We are often thankful for knowledge, but in this case we may be
   particularly grateful for ignorance. It is the Glory of God, we are
   told, to conceal a thing and it most certainly is for the happiness of
   mankind that He should conceal their future. Supposing that bright
   lines were written for us in the book of destiny and that we could read
   those bright lines now, and be sure of them--we would probably loiter
   away our time until we arrived at them--and would have no heart for the
   present. If, on the other hand, we knew that there were dark days of
   trouble in store for us, and had a full conviction as to when they
   would come, probably the thought of them would overshadow the present
   so that the joys which we now drink would be left untasted by reason of
   our nervous fears as to the distant future! To know the good might lead
   us to presumption--to know the evil might tempt us to despair. Happy
   for us is it that our eyes cannot penetrate the thick veil which God
   hangs between us and tomorrow, that we cannot see beyond the spot where
   we now are and that, in a certain sense, we are utterly ignorant as to
   the details of the future. We may, indeed, be thankful for our
   ignorance!

   Although, however, we do not know what a day may bring forth or though
   we cannot see into what I may call, "the immediate future," yet we have
   reason to be thankful that we do know something about what is to come
   and that we do know what is in the far-reaching future. We differ from
   the animals in this respect. When, two or three nights in the week, I
   pass on my way home a flock of sheep, or a little herd of bulls--all
   going down to the butcher's, travelling in the cold, bright moonlight
   towards the slaughterhouse--I feel thankful that they do not know where
   they are going, for what would be their misery if they knew anything
   about death? The lamb's thoughts are in the fold and all unconscious of
   the shambles. It licks the hand that kills it, not knowing of its
   coming speedy death. It is the happiness of the brute not to know the
   future!

   But in our case, we know that we must die--and if it were not for the
   hope of the Resurrection and of the hereafter, this knowledge would
   distinguish us from the brutes only by giving us greater misery. There
   must be an intention on God's part for us to live in a future state or
   else He would, out of mere benevolence, have left us ignorant of the
   fact of death. If He had not meant our souls to begin to prepare for
   another and a better existence, He would have kept us ignorant, even,
   of the fact that this one will pass away. But having given us an
   intellect and a mind which, both from observation and inward
   consciousness must know that death will come, we believe that He would
   have us prepare for that which will follow and look out for that which
   is beyond. We do know the future in its great rough outlines. We know
   that if the Lord comes not first, we shall die. We know that our soul
   shall live forever in happiness or in woe and that, according to
   whether we are found in Christ or without Christ, our eternal portion
   shall be one of never-ending agony or of ceaseless bliss! We may be
   thankful that we do know this, so that we may be prepared for it. But
   still--to return to that with which we started--we may also be thankful
   that we do not really know the great future in its details, that it is
   shut from our eyes lest it should have an evil influence upon our life.

   Now, Solomon, in the Book of Proverbs, applied the Truth that we know
   not about tomorrow to the boaster, the man who said, "Tomorrow I will
   go into such a city and buy, and sell, and get gain, and then go to
   another city, and get

   more gain, and then, when I have amassed so much wealth, I will say,
   'Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease--eat,
   drink and be merry.'" Solomon seems to come in and put his hand upon
   the man's shoulder and to say, virtually, "You fool, you know nothing
   about all this! You do not know what shall be on the morrow--your goods
   may never come to you, or you may not be here to trade with these goods
   at all. So you build a castle in the air! You think your fancies are
   true. You are as one that dreams of a feast and wakes to find himself
   hungry! How can you be so foolish?" Solomon dwells upon the text very
   solemnly and says, "Boast not yourself of tomorrow, for you know not
   what a day may bring forth."

   I do not intend, however, to use the text with this objective tonight.
   It struck me that as Solomon uses it here with one design, it might be
   very properly used for another. That as he intends to shame our growing
   pride and certainty of prosperity, so it might be used especially to
   cheer those who have a tendency to gloom--and to shed a ray of light
   into the thick darkness of their fear.

   I. It will, first, comfort THOSE WHO ARE FEARING AND TREMBLING
   CONCERNING SOME EVIL WHICH IS YET TO COME.

   My Friend, you are afraid tonight. You cannot enjoy anything you have
   because of this terrible and fearful shadow which has come across your
   path of an evil which you say is coming tomorrow, or in one or two
   months' time--or even in six months. Now, at least, you are not quite
   certain that it will come, for you know not what may be on the morrow.
   You are as alarmed and as afraid as if you were quite certain that it
   would appear. But it is not so, "You know not what a day may bring
   forth," and since it is uncertain whether it shall be or not, had you
   not better leave your sorrow till it is certain? And meanwhile, leave
   the uncertain matter in the hands of God, whose Divine Purposes will be
   wise and good in the end, and will be even seen to be so! At the very
   least, slender as the comfort may be, yet there is still comfort in the
   fact that you know not what may be on the morrow!

   Let us expand this thought a little to those of you who are fearing
   about tomorrow. We very often fear what never will occur. I think that
   the major part of our troubles are not those which God sends us, but
   those which we invent for ourselves. As the poet speaks of some who--

   "Feel a thousand deaths in fearing one"-- so there are many who feel a
   thousand troubles in fearing one trouble, which trouble, perhaps, never
   will have any existence except in the workshop of their own misty
   brain! It is an ill task for a child to whip himself--it might be good
   for him to feel the whip from his father's hand, but it is of little
   service when the child applies it himself! And yet, very often the
   strokes which we dread never come from God's hand at all, but are the
   pure inventions of our own imagination and our own unbelief working
   together. There are more who have to howl under the lash of unbelief
   than there are who have to weep under the gentle rod of God's
   Providential dispensation. Now, why should you go about to fill your
   pillow with thorns grown in your own garden? Why so busy, good Sir,
   about gathering nettles with which to strew your own bed? There are
   clouds enough without your thinking that every little atom of mist will
   surely bring a storm. There are difficulties enough on the road to
   Heaven without your taking up stones to throw into your own path to
   make your own road more rough than there was any need that it should
   be! You know not what may be on the morrow. Your fears are absurd!
   Perhaps your neighbor knows they are absurd, but certainly you ought to
   know it is so! Do you not know that the trouble you are dreading, God
   can utterly avert? Perhaps tomorrow morning there will come a letter
   which will entirely change the face of the matter. A friend may
   interpose when least you could expect one, or difficulties which were
   like mountains may be cast into the depths of the sea. "You know not
   what a day may bring forth," and the trouble which you so much dread
   may never occur at all!

   Moreover, do you not know that even if the trouble should come, God has
   a way of overruling it?So that even you, poor Trembler, shall stand by
   and see the salvation of God and wonder at two things--your own
   unbelief and God's faithfulness! You say that the sea is before you,
   that the mountains are on either side and that the foe is behind
   you--but you know not what shall be on the morrow! Your God shall lead
   you through the depths of the sea and put such a song in your mouth as
   you never could have known if there had been no sea, no Pharaoh and no
   mountains to shut you in! These trials of yours shall be the winepress
   out of which shall come the wine of consolation to you! This furnace
   shall rob you of nothing but your dross, which you will be glad to be
   rid of--but your pure gold shall not be diminished by so much as a

   drachma, but shall only be the purer after it all! The trouble, then,
   may not come to you at all, or if it comes, it may be overruled.

   And there is one thing more. Supposing the trial does come, your God
   has promised that as your days, so shall your strength be. Has He not
   said it many times in His Word, "I will never leave you, nor forsake
   you"? He never did promise you freedom from trouble. He speaks of
   rivers and of your going through them! He speaks of fires and of your
   passing through them! But He has added, "When you pass through the
   waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not
   overflow you; when you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned;
   neither shall the flame kindle upon you." What matters it to you, then,
   whether there is fire or not if you are not burned? What matters it to
   you whether there are floods or not if you are not drowned? As long as
   you escape with spiritual life and health and come up out of all your
   trials the better for them, you may rejoice in tribulations! Thank God
   when your temptations abound! And be glad when He puts you into the
   furnace because of the blessing which you are sure to receive from it.
   So then, since you know not what may be on the morrow, take heart, you
   fearing one, and put your fears away! Do as you have been told--
   delight yourself in the Lord--and He shall give you the desires of your
   heart. Cast your burden upon the Lord and He will sustain you. He will
   never suffer the righteous to be moved. Did not David say, speaking by
   the Holy Spirit, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the
   Lord delivers him out of them all"? I charge you, therefore, to be of
   good comfort since you know not what may be on the morrow. This is the
   message to fearful saints.

   II. But now we will use the text to another class of Christians whose
   painful position really deserves more pity than that of those who only
   invent their fears, or who are troubled about the future. I mean THOSE
   WHO ARE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT DISCONSOLATE THROUGH IMMEDIATE DISTRESS
   AND PRESENT AFFLICTION.

   We little know, my Brothers and Sisters, when we gather here, how many
   cases of distress may be assembled in this house at any one time.
   Verily the poor have not ceased out of the land! The poor we have
   always with us and some of the poor, too, who need to have other mouths
   to speak for them, since from their very independence of spirit and
   their Christian character they are slow to speak for themselves. There
   may be a trouble in my neighbor's heart which is almost bursting it
   while I am sitting peacefully enjoying the Word. We should remember
   those who are in bonds, as bound with them--and sympathize with those
   who are troubled as being ourselves, also, in the body.

   It will not be a waste of time, then, if I say to you who are troubled
   about worldly matters that there is comfort for you in this passage.
   "You know not what a day may bring forth." You say, "It is all over
   with me! I will give up in despair." No, Friend, do not do so for one
   day longer, for you know not what a day may bring forth! And if
   tomorrow bring you not deliverance, hope on at least for one day more,
   for, "you know not what a day may bring forth." And I would keep on
   with the same advice till the last day of life! At least for one day
   more there is no room for despair. You cannot conclude that God has
   forsaken you, or that Providence has utterly turned against you! At
   least you know not what may be on the morrow, so wait till you have
   seen that day out! Give not yourself up as a hopeless victim to despair
   till you have seen what tomorrow may bring you!

   What unexpected turns there have been in the lives of those who have
   trusted in God! You who are trusting in yourselves may help yourselves
   as best you can, but you who are trusting in God have ample reasons to
   expect that God will come to your assistance! It is yours to watch and
   yours to work as if everything depended upon you, but it is yours,
   also, to remember that everything does notdepend upon you! Sometimes
   God has come in to help His servants so exactly at what we call, "the
   nick of time," that they have hardly been able to believe their own
   senses! "Strange," they say, "it is like a miracle!" And so, indeed, it
   is, for the difference between the old dispensation and the new is that
   God used to work His wonders by suspending the Laws of Nature, whereas
   now He does greater things than this, inasmuch as He achieves His
   purposes quite as marvelously and lets the Laws of Nature remain as
   they are! He does not make the ravens bring His people bread and meat,
   but He lets them have their bread and their meat when they need them.

   God does not, nowadays, make the manna drop down from Heaven. No doubt
   some people would like Him to do so, but still He brings the manna, for
   all that--there is the bread and there are the clothes--and therewith
   should the Christian be content! He supplies His people's needs by
   ordinary means and herein is He to be wondered at and to be adored!
   Look up, then! Wipe away that tear. Do not talk for a moment of
   murmuring against God. Do not go home with that sorry tale to your wife
   and children and tell them that God is not faithful to you. Wait till
   tomorrow, at any rate, for "you know not what a day may bring forth."

   And to you who are disconsolate about spiritual things I might quote
   the same text. You say, "Ah, I have been hearing the Word a very long
   time and all that I have got from it is a sense of sin, or hardly that.
   Oh, how I wish that God would bless the Word to my soul! I am longing
   to be saved! What would I not give to be a Christian--a true and
   sincere Christian--one in whom the Spirit of God has worked a new heart
   and a right spirit! Oh," you say, "I have sought it by listening to the
   Word and I have sought it in earnest prayer--but months have passed and
   I have made no advance. I have no more hope, now, than I had long ago!
   I seem as far off the attainment of eternal life as I was when first I
   heard the Word. No, if possible, I am further off! The Word has been a
   savor of death unto death to me, and not a savor of life unto life."
   Well, my dear Friend, do not give up listening to the Word! Do not give
   up treading the courts of the Lord's house, for if you have up to now
   got no blessing, yet, being in the way, the Lord may meet with you--for
   you know not what may be on the morrow!

   How many years these poor creatures waited around the pool when they
   expected that an angel would, at a certain season, come and trouble the
   water! There they waited. And though they were disappointed scores of
   times by others stepping in before them, yet, seeing it was the only
   hope they had, they waited! Now, it is in the use of the means that you
   are likely to get a blessing. "Faith come by hearing, and hearing by
   the Word of God." Do not, therefore, be persuaded to cease hearing, for
   you know not what may be on the morrow! The very next sermon you shall
   hear may be the means of your enlightenment! The very next address at
   the Prayer Meeting may give you encouragement. The very next time the
   Gospel trumpet sounds, you may obtain your liberty--and what a blessing
   will that liberty be! When you do find it, you will say it was well
   worth waiting for.

   Let me add another exhortation. Do not give up praying! It is a common
   device of Satan to say to the seeking soul, "The Lord will never hear
   you. You are one of the reprobate! He has never written your name in
   the Book of Life." Soul, pray as long as you have breath! Let it be
   your firm resolve to remain at the Throne of Grace! Say to yourself--

   "If I perish, I will pray, And perish only there."

   It is not said that the gate of Mercy will open at the first knock. If
   it were, there would be no room for the virtue of importunity! But the
   Lord, who delights in our importunity, encourages us with the promise
   that one day the gate will be opened. "Ask and it shall be given you;
   seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you." And
   who knows how soon this may be? Why, before you close your eyes
   tonight, you may be able to look to Christ Crucified and find joy and
   peace in believing! Instead of the weeping prayer at the bedside, there
   may be a happy prayer of another kind--not with tears of sorrow, but
   with tears of holy joy--to think that the Lord has enlightened your
   darkness, that you have looked unto Christ and now your face is not
   ashamed! Why should it not be so tonight? Why should it not be so on
   the morrow? God grant, poor disconsolate one, that it may be so very
   speedily!

   At any rate, will you let me repeat the advice I have already given?
   Since you cannot know that God will not hear you. Since it never was
   revealed to any man and never will be, that God will notregard his cry,
   if you can get no further than the king of Nineveh did, yet go on and,
   "who can tell" what may be, for you know not what a day may bring
   forth! I will tell you one thing and you may take it as being God's own
   Truth--if you go to Christ empty-handed, guilty, yet willing to take
   all your salvation from Him as a free gift--and if you cast yourself
   upon Him, I will tell you what the day willbring forth! It will bring
   forth eternal life to you--salvation, joy and peace! It will bring
   forth adoption, for you shall be received into the Divine Family! It
   will bring forth to you the foretaste of the Heaven which God has
   prepared for His people! You shall know a blessed day here that shall
   be a foretaste of a never-ending day hereafter--a day that shall be as
   one of the days of Heaven upon earth!

   I wish that the Lord would bless these words of mine to disconsolate
   ones. I think there may be some who may be sustained for a while and
   kept up by what I have said. But it will be better, still, if they
   shall now be filled with a desperate resolve to cast themselves at the
   foot of the Cross. Then little do they know what the day will bring
   forth! They cannot imaging the joy they shall have, nor the peace they
   shall receive! The pardon which Christ shall give them is far more rich
   than they have thought it could be--and the success with which their
   prayers shall be crowned is far more marvelous than even their best
   hopes have conceived! "You know not what a day may bring forth."

   III. Now thirdly, turning this time not to those who are fearing the
   future, nor yet to those who are disconsolate about present affliction,
   I thought of addressing a few words to THOSE WHO ARE WEARIED IN THE
   MASTER'S

   SERVICE.

   I can scarcely sympathize, as I could wish to do, with those who have
   worked for Christ unsuccessfully. To say, "Master, I have toiled all
   the night and have taken nothing," has never been my lot and,
   therefore, I can only speak from what I suppose to be the feeling of
   unsuccessful men. For these many years I have been preaching the Gospel
   in this great London and I know not that at any time God has blessed us
   more than He is blessing us now! Neither can I say that at any time He
   has blessed us less, for it seems as if He has always been giving us
   more than we can receive and blessing the Word exceedingly above what
   we asked or ever thought! There is room for nothing in my case but
   gratitude and encouragement, for humble dependence upon God for the
   future and adoring joy for the past and the present.

   But, what hard work it must be for a minister or a Sunday school
   teacher to go on preaching and laboring positively without success, or
   with so little that it is only like a cluster here and there upon the
   topmost bough! I can imagine such Brothers and Sisters feeling that
   they can speak no more in the name of the Lord. And, as they weep over
   their failure, saying with Isaiah, "Who has believed our report, and to
   whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" I should not wonder but that my
   text may whisper in their ears a comfortable thought, "You know not
   what a day may bring forth."

   Do not cease from your labor, dear Brother! You are fainting today, but
   tomorrow you may arise with new strength. Or feeling as if you were but
   weakness, itself, in the morning, though you may hardly know how it
   came about, in the evening you may be happy and cheerful! The Divine
   Presence may overshadow your heart and drive your fears away, consoling
   you in your distress and making you feel as if it were well to be God's
   servant even if one had no present reward!

   And what if, coming at the back of this, you should find yourself, next
   time you go to your work, discharging it with unusual zest and with new
   power? What if the pulpit, instead of being, as it has been, a prison
   to you, should suddenly come to be a palace? What if, instead of there
   being a mere bush in the wilderness, God should dwell in the bush and
   make it all ablaze, like that unconsumed burning bush which Moses saw?
   What if the stammering tongue should suddenly be unloosed and the cold
   heart be all aglow with Divine enthusiasm? What if the poor tongue of
   clay should suddenly become a tongue of fire? What a change it would
   be! Ah, but "you know not what a day may bring forth."

   And what if, while you are yourself thus quickened, there should fall a
   like spirit upon the people, upon the children in the class, upon the
   hearers in the House of Prayer? What if, instead of the dull, lead eyes
   which looked as if Death, itself, were gazing from them--what if,
   instead of stony and motionless hearers, there should suddenly be a
   holy sensitiveness given to the people--what would you say to that? Yet
   why should there not be? Sometimes such Grace comes all at once! The
   rock has been long smitten, yet it would not break--but, all of a
   sudden there has come a blow of the hammer, and that, perhaps, not so
   hard as many that have fallen before, but it has hit the rock in the
   right place and lo!--the mass of stone flies to shivers! "Oh!" you say,
   "I could keep on at my work if I thought that this would happen." Keep
   on at your work, then, Brother, for you do not know what will come
   next! Pray for great things and you may then expect them! You may not
   make sure of such blessing, of course, if you have not prayed for it!
   But, having sought it, why should it not come?

   I believe all Sunday school teachers find that sometimes such sudden
   melting comes over their classes, and ministers often realize that all
   of a sudden, they scarcely know how, but there is a change in the very
   aspect of their hearers, so that it is quite a different thing to
   preach. I am very conscious of the difference there is between the
   various congregations I address. Almost every day, and sometimes twice
   a day, I am preaching. Occasionally it is dreadful misery because, say
   what we will, we know we have not a sympathizing audience. We feel as
   though we were dragging a plow over the rough ground! But when we feel
   that the Spirit of God is there, then we realize that we are sowing
   this Good Seed, that it is falling on good ground--and we expect the
   joyful sheaves which are to be our reward!And yet, Brothers and
   Sisters, we are as much the servants of God when we are doing the one
   thing, as when we are doing the other--and are as much in His service
   when we are unsuccessful as when we are successful! We are not
   responsible to God for the souls that are saved, but we are responsible
   for the Gospel that we preach and for the way in which we preach it.
   And "who can tell" whether those of us who have been least successful
   may not suddenly exchange our heavy toil for the most delightful
   service, for we know not what a day may bring forth!

   And how do you know, my Brothers and Sisters, what may yet happen? You
   were saying, this morning, "It is a dark age for the Church." Well, so
   it is. You were saying, "I believe it is quite a crisis." So it is.
   Every year, in fact, seems to be a crisis. "Ah," you say, "but there
   are peculiar dangers now." No doubt there are! And I think the oldest
   man here remembers that there were peculiar dangers when he was a
   boy--there always have been and always will be peculiar dangers! But if
   there is danger from this revival of Ritualism and, no doubt there
   is--yet who among us can tell what a day may bring forth? Are we
   certain that God will not yet turn back the tide of Romanizing error?
   Are we sure that He has not a man somewhere, or even 50 men who shall
   be the instruments of accomplishing this? Has it not often occurred
   that the very men who have been the hottest advocates of a certain
   system have afterwards been the greatest enemies of that system? The
   Christian Church could never have expected to get an Apostle from among
   the Pharisees and, least of all, could they have supposed that they
   would find in Saul of Tarsus, the blood-thirsty persecutor, the great
   Apostle of the Gentiles--not one whit behind the very chief of the
   twelve! You and I do not know what God has in store. There may be
   somewhere at this very moment a man, unknown to you, who is reading the
   Word and, as he reads it, he may, like the monk, Luther, get such of
   the Light of God through the reading that he who once helped to build
   up, will be the instrument in God's hand to destroy! I am getting more
   and more hopeful about these matters. I entertain the most sanguine
   expectation that the God who has put His enemies to rout in years gone
   by will do it now once again! And instead of sitting down in anything
   like heaviness of spirit, or oppression of heart, I would speak
   hopefully and have you, my Brothers and Sisters, be filled with hope,
   for we do not know what a day may bring forth!

   Suddenly the whole current of the public mind may be turned! There may
   come a great tide of conversions which shall be the strength and the
   joy of the Christian Church! On a sudden, slumbering Churches may
   awake, gracious revivals may come! Upon the land the Holy Fire may once
   again descend from Heaven. The Christian Church may start up to find
   that the God who answered by fire is still in her midst! The mourning
   Christian may put off his ashes and sackcloth, and put on his beautiful
   array and a shout ofjoy may go up, "Hallelujah! Hallelujah!" where you
   and I expected to hear nothing but, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!"

   Let us, then, if we are working for the Master, instead of growing
   tired with service, hear Him say to us, "Be not weary in well doing,
   for in due season you shall reap if you faint not." Let us, my beloved
   Brothers, be steadfast, unmov-able, always abounding in the work of the
   Lord, for as we know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord. You
   know not how soon you shall see this success, for you know not what a
   day may bring forth. I hope every city missionary who hears me, every
   Bible woman, every minister, every tract-distributor, every Sunday
   school teacher, will try and look this very sweet thought in the face!
   Expect that God is going to do great things and He will do them, for He
   does very much according to His people's expectations. According to
   your faith shall it be done unto you!

   IV. I will now say a few words, in the fourth place, to THOSE WHO ARE
   DISPIRITED IN PRAYER--to some

   who have been engaged in special supplication for some objective, but
   who, up till now, have received no answer--and are ready to give up
   praying. Let me encourage such to persevere by repeating to them the
   words of Solomon, "You know not what a day may bring forth."

   There is a story I have often heard told by our Methodist friends of a
   woman who had long prayed for her husband. She resolved that she would
   pray for him every day a certain number of times. I think it was for 10
   years and after that, she would pray no longer, supposing that if her
   prayer was not heard by that time, it would be an intimation that God
   did not intend to grant the blessing. I do not think she was right in
   setting any limit to God at all, or that she had any right to act so.
   However, on this occasion, God winked at His servant's infirmity and,
   so the story goes--and I do not doubt its correctness--on the day on
   which she was to cease from prayer, her husband suddenly turned
   thoughtful and asked her the question which she had so longed to hear
   from him, "What must I do to be saved?" I am sure that those who have
   watched over their success in prayer will have met with cases quite as
   startling as that--things which your neighbor would not believe if you
   were to tell him, but which you treasure up among those inward
   experiences which are true to you, however improbable they may seem to
   other people! You know, dear Friends, that you have obtained answers to
   prayer, very amazing ones, and have obtained them very promptly and
   very punctually. You have had your prayers met just as an honest
   merchant meets his bills at the appointed time. On the expected day God
   has met with you and given you what you wanted and what you sought
   for--just at the very time you needed it.

   But now I will suppose that you are tried thus. That dear child of
   yours, instead of hopefully rewarding your prayers, seems to be going
   from bad to worse! Perhaps, dear Brother, it is your son. And I know
   there are many such cases. The devil has told you that it is no use to
   pray for him, for God will never hear you. Or else good Sister, it is
   your broth-er--and your prayers for him has been incessant--indeed, it
   has been a constant burden on your mind. Now, in such cases, I charge
   you, I earnestly entreat you never to listen to the malicious
   insinuation of Satan that, "you may as well leave off praying, for you
   will not be heard," for, at the very least, and I am now putting it on
   the very lowest ground, possible, "You know not what a day may bring
   forth." You cannot tell but that the hard heart may yet be softened and
   the rebellious will be subdued. You would be surprised to go home and
   find your son converted, would you not? Well, but such things have
   occurred! You would be surprised if your wife came in some Sunday
   evening and said, "I have been hearing So-and-So, and God has met with
   me." Yet why should it not be so? Is anything too hard for the Lord? Is
   His arm shortened that it cannot save? Is His ear heavy that it cannot
   hear? Even if you should die without seeing your children converted, or
   your dear ones brought in--you do not know, even then, what a day may
   bring forth! They may be converted after you are dead--and it will
   tend, possibly, to swell the joy of Heaven when you shall see them,
   after years of wandering, brought to follow their father, their father
   whom in life they despised, but whom after he was gone they came to
   imitate! Persevere in prayer, Christian! "Men ought always to pray, and
   not to faint." Praying breath is never sent in vain. Still besiege the
   Throne of God! The city may hold out for a while, but prayer should
   capture it. Beleaguer the Throne of Grace--it is to be taken. Never
   raise the siege until you get the blessing--the blessing shall
   certainly be yours.

   V. And now I cannot talk longer on this matter, so I will close with
   just another thought to THOSE OF US WHO ARE CHEERFUL AND HAPPY.

   I hope there are many of us who are neither afraid and fretting about
   the future, nor depressed about the present, neither worn out with toil
   in the Master's service, nor dispirited in prayer. There are some of us
   to whom the Lord is so gracious that our cup runs over. Now we may just
   put another drop on the top of the full cup. Dear Friend, "you know not
   what a day may bring forth." It may perhaps bring forth to you and to
   me our last day. What a blessed day that would be--our last day! Our
   dying day! No, do not call it so, but the day of our translation--the
   day of our great change, the day of our being taken up--that of our
   being carried away in the fiery chariot to be forever with the Lord!

   You know not but what this may be your case tomorrow. Oh, what joy! I
   am doubting and fearing, today, but I may see His face tomorrow! And
   see it so as never to lose sight of it again! From my poor tenement of
   poverty I am going to the mansions of eternal blessedness! From the
   sickbed, where I have tossed in pain, I shall mount to everlasting joy!
   The streets of gold may be trod tomorrow and the palm branch of victory
   may be waved tomorrow--the streets trod by these weary feet and the
   palm branch waved by these toil-worn hands! Yes, tomorrow the chants of
   angels may be in your ears and the swell of celestial music may make
   your soul glad. Tomorrow you may see the beautiful vision and may
   behold the King in His beauty in the land that is very far off. I like
   to live in the constant anticipation of being "with Christ, which is
   far better." Do not put it off, Christian, as though it were far away!
   If we had to wait a hundred years they would soon pass, like a watch in
   the night. But we shall not live as long as that. We may be with our
   Lord tomorrow! We may sup here on earth and breakfast in Heaven! We may
   breakfast on earth and hear Christ, say, "Come and dine," or we may go
   from our Communion Table here to the great Supper of the Lamb above, to
   be with Him forever!

   This is the best of it. When somebody said to a Christian minister, "I
   suppose you are on the wrong side of fifty?" "No," he said, "thank God,
   I am on the right side of fifty, for I am sixty and am, therefore,
   nearer Heaven." Old age should never be looked upon with dismay by
   us--it should be our joy! If our hearts were right in this matter,
   instead of being at all afraid at the thought of parting from this
   life, we should say--

   "Ah me! Ah me that I

   In Kedar's tents here stay!

   No place like this on high.

   There, Lord! Guide my way.

   Ohappyplace!

   When shall I be,

   My God, with You,

   And see Your face?"

   I have not time to say much to others here who are not concerned in
   these sweet themes, but I will at least say this. Let thee careless and
   thoughtless here remember that they do not know what a day may bring
   forth. Tomorrow it may not be that grand party to which you are
   intending to go. Tomorrow it may not be that sweet sin of which your
   evil nature is thinking. Tomorrow may see you on a sickbed. Tomorrow
   may see you on your deathbed. Tomorrow, worst of all, may see you in
   Hell! O Sinner, what a state to live in--to be in daily jeopardy of
   eternal ruin, to have the wrath of God, who is always angry with the
   wicked, abiding on you--and not to know but that tomorrow you may be
   where you can find no escape, no hope, no comfort! Tomorrow in
   eternity! Tomorrow banished from His Presence forever! Tomorrow to have
   that awful sentence thrilling in your soul, "Depart from Me, you
   cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."

Maroth--or, the Disappointed

   (No. 3184)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER25,1873.

   "For the inhabitant of Marroth waited carefully for good: but evil came
   down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem." Micah 1:12.

   The village of the bitter spring, for that is probably the meaning of
   this name, Maroth, experienced a bitter disappointment. At the time
   when the Assyrians invaded the land, the inhabitants expected that
   deliverance would come to them from some quarter or other. From the
   context, I judge that they placed some sort of reliance upon the
   Philistines. They possibly had some hope that the king of Egypt would
   come up to attack Sennacherib. Evidently they looked for help
   everywhere except to God and, consequently, as no good came to them
   from the men upon whom they had relied, trial and overwhelming distress
   came to them from the hand of God. He was angry at their trust in men
   and their lack of trust in Himself and, therefore, He punished their
   unbelief by their total overthrow! The Assyrian swept over them and
   stopped not till he reached the gate of Jerusalem, where Hezekiah's
   faith in God made the enemy pause and retreat.

   The fact recorded in the text suggests to us, first, sad
   disappointments--"the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good:
   but evil came." And secondly, strange appointments--evil came down from
   the Lord." When we have considered these two things, we will change the
   subject, altogether, and speak about expectations which will not end in
   disappointment.

   I. First, then, we are to think of SAD DISAPPOINTMENTS. "The inhabitant
   of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came."

   Disappointments are often extremely painful at the time. Even in little
   things, we do not like to be disappointed. If our expectations are not
   realized, we feel as if a sharp thorn has pierced our flesh. But in
   great matters, disappointment is much more serious. In the case of the
   inhabitants of Maroth, it was fatal--they expected to be delivered from
   the Assyrians, but they were either slain on the spot, or carried away
   captive to Nineveh. It would be the most terrible disappointment of all
   if our expectations concerning our souls should not be realized! It
   would be painful to the last degree to discover upon our dying bed that
   the good we had looked for had not come--to find that we had built our
   house upon the sand and that when we most needed its shelter, it was
   swept away! O Lord, disappoint not Your servant's hope! All my
   expectation is from You and You have said, "They shall not be ashamed
   that wait for Me." Any other expectation beside this, concerning our
   eternal interests, will only bring us pain and misery forever.

   Disappointments in this life, however, although they are at times very
   painful, are sometimes of such a character that could we know all the
   truth, we would not lament them. There are many who have looked forward
   to a change in their condition in life, or their position in
   society--and they have been disappointed. For a time they have been
   ready to wring their hands in anguish, yet if they knew what the
   consequences would have been if their expectations had been realized,
   they would fall down upon their knees and devoutly praise the Lord for
   the disappointment which had been so great a blessing in disguise to
   them! You, my Brother, had expected to be rich by this time, but God
   knew that had you been rich, you would have been proud and worldly and
   would have ceased to enjoy fellowship with him--so He kept you poor
   that you might still be rich in faith! You, my Friend, had expected to
   be in robust health at this time, but had you been so, you might not
   have been walking so humbly before the Lord as you are now doing. You,
   my oft-bereaved Brother, had hoped to see your family spared to grow
   up, so that you might have had sons and daughters upon whom you could
   have leaned in your declining days--yet they might have proved a plague
   and a sorrow to you instead of a comfort and a blessing. Complain not
   that they were taken from you in their childhood by that kind hand
   which made them blest

   forever and only deprived you for a while of their companionship, which
   might not have been an unmixed blessing to you. Rest assured, O child
   of God, that whatever happens to you is as it should be! Believe that
   if you could have infinite wisdom, and the helm of your life's vessel
   could be entrusted to your hands, you would steer it precisely as God
   steers it! You would not always guide the ship through smooth water any
   more than He does. If you could be unerring in judgment and could be
   your own guide, you would choose for yourself the track which God has
   chosen for you. It is Divine Love and Infallible Wisdom that have
   ordered all things for you up to this very moment, so whatever your
   disappointments may have been, comfort yourself with the assurance that
   they have been among your greatest blessings!

   There are some expectations which are certain to be disappointed. When
   a man expects to prosper through wrongdoing, his expectations will
   certainly not be realized--at least not in the long run, however much
   he may seem to prosper for a while. When a man thinks that happiness
   can be found in the ways of sin, he will be bitterly disappointed
   sooner or later. When a man expects that by self-reliance he will be
   able to gain all that he needs without trusting to a stronger arm than
   his own, his expectations will not be realized. When a man is relying
   upon his fellow creature--when he thinks that the all-important matter
   for him is to have some rich patron or powerful friend--and he is under
   the delusion that he can do without any help from Heaven--he is sure to
   be disappointed! And he who is depending upon his own good works and
   trusting to his own unaided resolutions to hold on in the way of
   holiness will be terribly disappointed unless he repents before it is
   too late! There are some things which only fools will expect--things
   which are contrary to the laws of Nature, and things which are contrary
   to the rules of Divine Grace! The man who never sows good corn, but yet
   expects to reap at harvest time, is a fool and his disappointment will
   come in the form of thorns and thistles all over his fields! The
   sluggard who lies in bed and lazily says, "A little more sleep, a
   little more slumber, a little more folding of the hands to sleep," may
   expert in that way to become wealthy, but Solomon long ago said to him,
   "Your poverty shall come as one that travels and your need as an armed
   man." This is true in spiritual things as well as in temporal. God
   gives blessing to effort and diligence--not to idleness and lethargy!

   Besides this, in many cases disappointments are highly probable. Some
   of our familiar proverbs relate to such cases as these. One says,
   "Those who wait for dead men's shoes are pretty sure to go barefoot."
   Another is, "If they never drink milk till they get their uncle's cow,
   they will be long thirsty for the lack of it." Yet there are persons
   who waste a great part of their lifetime in vain expectations of what
   they call, "windfalls." We know that the "windfalls" in the orchard
   generally fall because they are rotten and are not worth picking up!
   And other "windfalls" are often no more valuable. There are men who
   might have prospered if they had not foolishly sat down in the
   expectation that somehow or other, a great fortune would hunt them out
   and make them independent--such expectations are usually doomed to
   disappointment. If any of you have fallen into the pernicious habit of
   reading works of fiction and so have formed romantic ideas of what is
   likely to occur to you, the great probability is that your daydreams
   will be only dreams--and your castles in the air will never be
   inhabited by you! I pray you not to fritter away your time and
   opportunities in vain expectations which most probably will never be
   fulfilled. Expect to receive not quite all you earn, nor all you lend,
   and probably your expectations will not be disappointed, but, as
   another of our proverbs puts it, if you count your chickens before they
   are hatched, it is highly probable that your expectations will not be
   realized.

   There are also other expectations that will possibly end in
   disappointment. Even the most legitimate hopes are not always realized.
   "There's many a slip between the cup and the lips." When we feel almost
   sure that a certain plan will succeed, suddenly it turns out to be all
   a mistake. We think that as prudent men, we have arranged matters so
   wisely that they have to succeed, yet in the issue we are grievously
   disappointed. Be not hasty in condemning those who do not succeed in
   business, for at least in somecases, failure has come through no fault
   of theirs. Do not judge harshly all who are in need--no doubt there are
   all too many instances in which poverty is the result of idleness or
   drunkenness--but there are other cases in which poverty is blameless
   and even honorable. Men may toil hard, do the very best they can and
   seek God's blessing upon their efforts--and yet they may not be
   permitted to secure a competence. If you, my Friend, reckon upon seeing
   all your schemes succeed, you are very likely to be disappointed. If
   you, my Christian Brother, imagine that between here and Heaven, the
   way will be laid with smooth turf, well-rolled, you will certainly be
   disappointed! If you think that the sea will always be calm as a lake
   and that no storm will ever ruffle it, you will be disappointed. There
   will be some things that will fulfill your expectations, but there will
   be others that will not--and in those you will be like that inhabitants
   of Maroth who "waited carefully for good, but evil came."

   In every case disappointments should be borne with the greatest
   possible patience and equanimity. I am sorry to say that we do not all
   bear them so, not even all of us who profess to be Christians. Remember
   that God has never promised that all our expectations shall be
   fulfilled--it would have been a doubtful blessing if such a thing had
   been guaranteed to us--and we might easily have expected ourselves into
   utter misery! Who are you that everything should happen just as you
   wish? Should the weather be fine simply because you want it to be so
   when a thousand fields are gasping for rain? Should you have the
   channels of trade turned in your direction when if that were the case,
   scores of others would be bankrupts? Is everything in this world to be
   so arranged that you shall be the darling and pet of Providence? It
   cannot be right for such a state of things to prevail! Therefore, when
   we are disappointed, whether it is in little matters or great ones, let
   us bear the disappointment bravely and lay the whole case before the
   Lord in prayer. Let us ask Him why He contends with us. And if there is
   any reason for it which we can discover in ourselves, let us endeavor
   to remove it. Or if we can find no cause, let us believe that God acts
   in wisdom and in love--and let us cheerfully submit to whatever He
   appoints for us.

   We would bear our disappointments with all the greater equanimity if we
   would always remember that disappointments are often exceedingly
   instructive. What do they teach us? Well, first they teach us that our
   judgment is very fallible. We learn from them that we are not such
   prophets as we thought we were! We fancied that if we said that
   such-and-such a thing was going to happen, it would surely be so. But
   when the result proved to be just the opposite, we found that our
   judgment was not as reliable as we thought it was and, therefore, our
   forecast was quite inaccurate. So our disappointments teach us our need
   of greater wisdom than our own--and also teach us the folly of trusting
   to our own understanding.

   They also teach us the uncertainty of everything that is earthly. What
   is there, here, that can be depended upon for a single hour? The life
   of the most robust may suddenly end! The current of affairs may change
   more rapidly than the tide. Riches take to themselves wings and fly
   away. The greatest wisdom becomes the greatest folly. All is vanity and
   vexation of spirit. If our disappointments teach us this lesson, we
   shall be well repaid for having suffered them!

   Let them also teach us to speak correctly, as Christians should. You
   know how the Apostle James writes, "Come now, you who say, Today or
   tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year, and buy
   and sell, and get gain. Whereas you know not what shall be on the
   morrow...For that you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we shall live
   and do this or that.'" Let our past disappointments warn us to speak
   with bated breath about tomorrow and the more distant future, and not
   to say without any qualification what we will do as if all time were at
   our disposal and we were the disposers of all events. Even if we do not
   always use the words, "If the Lord wills," "If God pleases," "If we are
   spared," or similar expressions, let the spirit of them always be in
   our mind so that we do not think and speak unconditionally concerning
   the unknown future!

   Let our disappointments also teach us to submit--absolutely and
   unquestioningly--to the Lord's will. We wish to have things in a
   certain fashion, but God plainly indicated that they are not to be so.
   Therefore let us cheerfully surrender our wish to His will. Surely, O
   child of God, you would not think of wanting to have your way when once
   you learn that it is contrary to your heavenly Father's way! If you are
   right-minded, you will at once give up your wish and will say, "Not my
   will, O my Father, but Your will be done!" You will probably do that
   all the more decidedly if some disappointment has burnt into your soul
   the Truth that God is wiser than you are--and that His will must always
   prevail above yours. Stand to the surrender at all times and say to the
   Lord, "Show me Your way, and let me hear the voice behind me saying,
   'This is the way; walk you in it.'"

   Let me also add that disappointments may be greatly sanctified. They
   are not always so, for sometimes they irritate and so cause sin--or
   they create a murmuring spirit against God and so make us worse than we
   were before. But sanctified disappointments are part of that rod of the
   Covenant which is so beneficial in the hands of a chastening God.
   Sometimes a grievous disappointment has changed the whole current of a
   person's life. A man was looking forward to what he hoped would be a
   happy marriage, but his intended bride suddenly died--and then he
   surrendered his heart to Jesus, who became the Bridegroom of his soul!
   A son had expected to inherit a large estate, but by some means the
   wealth came not into his possession--and when he found himself poor, he
   sought true riches in Christ! A strong man had hoped to build up a
   prosperous business, but he was unexpectedly struck with serious
   illness, his former prosperity departed from him--and then he fixed his
   hopes upon the ever-blessed Son of God and so he attained to bliss
   which no earthly success could ever have brought him! I remember
   meeting a man who told me that he could never see spiritually until he
   had lost his natural eyesight! And there have, doubtless, been many who
   were never rich until they became poor, and others who were never happy
   until their earthly happiness was blighted and blasted, and then they
   sought and found true happiness in Jesus. What a blessed disappointment
   it is that leads us to a Savior's love!

   Disappointments are also sanctified to Believers when they help to wean
   them from the world. There is a sort of glue about this world that
   makes it adhere to us and makes us adhere to it. David found it so when
   he wrote, "My soul cleaves unto the dust." Earth naturally clings to
   earth, but I will guarantee you that David cared little enough for
   earth when his handsome son, Absalom, became a rebel and when his
   house, which had been such a comfort to him, became a terror and when
   his subjects, who had almost worshipped him, joined in rebelling
   against him! Then did he plaintively sigh, "Oh, that I had wings like a
   dove, for then would I fly away and be at rest." Yes, disappointments
   wean us from the world and makes us plume our wings, ready to be up and
   away to that fair country where hope shall reach its full fruition and
   disappointment shall be unknown forever!

   Moreover, Brothers and Sisters, when we meet with disappointments in
   this life, we prize all the more, the faithfulness of our God! When you
   have had an unkind word from one whom you have loved, how much more
   closely you have nestled down in the embrace of your ever-loving
   Savior! When you have been betrayed by a friend in whom you trusted,
   what sweet communion you have had with the Friend that sticks closer
   than a brother! When your gourd above you has withered and you have
   lost its welcome shade, however more you have prized the shadow of a
   great Rock in a weary land! It is a good thing for us to have all
   earthly props knocked away, for then we value more than ever the
   faithfulness of the God who never fails those who put their trust in
   Him. Those who always remain on dry land will never learn by practical
   experience what the sailors know--"They that go down to the sea in
   ships, that do business in great waters: these see the works of the
   Lord and His wonders in the deep." And it is when, like the
   storm-tossed mariners, our soul is melted because of trouble, that our
   dear Lord and Master, coming to us upon the crest of the wave, becomes
   tenfold more precious to us than He had ever been before! If our
   disappointments would only make us hold with a loose hand all we have--
   house, lands, children, health, reputation and everything else, so that
   if God should take them all away, we would still continue to bless His
   name because we never reckoned that they were ours to keep, but were
   only lent to us during our Lord's good will and pleasure--if our
   disappointments only brought us to such a condition as that, they would
   be, indeed, most soul-enriching things!

   II. Now I must leave this part of the subject and turn to the second
   portion which is STRANGE APPOINTMENTS--"The inhabitant of Maroth waited
   carefully for good: but evil came down from the Lord."

   This expression must not be misunderstood. "Evil came down from the
   Lord." The word, "evil," here means trial, affliction, chastisement,
   and to a Christian this kind of, "evil," is often for his highest good!
   It does seem singular to a child of God that even that which he thinks
   to be evil should come down from the Lord. How can it be that God is
   loving and kind when He deprives one of His children of her husband, or
   takes away her babe from her bosom? How can it be that God is
   Infinitely Wise, yet He sometimes casts His poor weak children into
   difficulties where they are at their wits' end and know not what to do?
   How is it that He loves the righteous and is gracious to them, yet He
   puts some of the best of them into the hottest part of the furnace and
   makes it burn most furiously like that of Nebuchadnezzar of old? If our
   aches and pains came from Satan. If our losses were the result of
   chance, or if our sufferings arose only from the malevolence of the
   wicked--they would be comprehensible--but it is oftentimes a marvel and
   a mystery to a Christian why the Lord sends the trials which lays upon
   him! Be patient, Brothers and Sisters! What you know not, now, you
   shall know hereafter--so be content to wait until God reveals the
   mystery to you if He pleases to do so--and then it will make you marvel
   that your Lord should have taken such pains in training you for the
   service He has for you yet to render Him!

   Perhaps I am addressing some child of God who is sorely puzzled as to
   why certain things have happened to him. But, Father, does your child
   always understand all that you do to him and for him? It was not long
   ago that your boy was sent away to school--perhaps he thought you
   unkind in treating him so--yet is was real love to him that prompted
   you to send him away from you to be all the better trained for whatever
   may lie before him in his later life. He does not understand all that
   is in your mind and you can never comprehend all that is in the
   Infinite Mind of your Father who is in Heaven. Be satisfied that
   whatever God does must be right.

   Yet, remember that in a certain sense, all trials do come from God.
   There may be secondary agents coming in between, but let us not quibble
   at them, or quarrel with them. When Shimei cursed David, Abishai said
   to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me
   go over, I pray you, and take off his head." But David said, "Let him
   curse, because the Lord has said to him, 'Curse David.'" He felt that
   he deserved to be cursed so he looked upon Shi-mei's insults as being a
   form of chastisement from God. If you strike a dog with a stick, he
   will bite the stick--but if he had more sense, he would try to bite
   you. And when we are chastened, it is foolish for us to be angry with
   the rod that God employs--and we dare not be angry with God! There may
   be sin in the person who causes us to suffer, as there was in the case
   of Shimei, but we must look beyond him even as David did--and learn
   what God's intention is in thus chastening us--and submissively accept
   whatever God appoints.

   There are some trials which come very distinctly from God. Perhaps you
   have lost one who was very dear to you. Let it comfort your heart that
   it was the Lord who took away your loved one. There is an empty chair
   in your house and every time you look at it your eyes fill with
   tears--yet never forget that it was the Lord who called to Himself the
   one who used to occupy that chair. Or possibly your trouble is that you
   are gradually fading away by consumption or some other deadly disease.
   Well, if it is so, that is God's appointment for you in the order of
   His Providence, so do not rebel against what is clearly His will. Or it
   may be that your trial is that you have struggled hard to gain an
   honest livelihood for yourself and your family, but instead of
   attaining that end, you are constantly getting further and further away
   from it. If it is so, look upon your trouble as coming from God and
   bear patiently what you are unable to alter!

   This leads me to say to every Christian whose trial is distinctly from
   the Lord--my Brother or Sister, this makes it all the easier for you to
   submit without murmuring at God's will When such a trial comes, there
   is nothing for a Believer to say but this, "It is the Lord: let Him do
   what seems good to Him." There may be cases in which submission will
   best be indicated by silence before the Lord. When Nadab and Abihu, the
   sons of Aaron, offered strange fire before the Lord and there went out
   fire from the Lord and devoured them, it must have been a terrible
   trial to their father, yet we read, "Aaron held his peace." As if he
   thought, "Since God has done it, what can I say?" You know the
   oft-repeated story of the gardener who had a favorite rose, and when it
   was plucked, he was very angry. But when he was told that the master
   had taken it, he said no more about the matter. May not the owner of
   the garden take any flowers in it that he pleases? And may not the Lord
   take away His beloved ones from us whenever He chooses to do so? We
   ought not to be vexed with Him when He does so, but we ought to say
   with Job, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the
   name of the Lord." No, my Lord, I must not and I will not quibble at
   anything that You have done. Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds
   of the earth, but let not man strive with his Maker. In our case, it
   would not only be striving with our Maker--it would be striving with
   our best Friend, our Father, our All-in-All--and that we must never do.
   So, if the trial has come distinctly from God, it should be easy to
   submit to it.

   And, further, if it comes distinctly from God, it gives us all the more
   powerful plea in prayer. One may plead thus, "O Lord, this trouble is
   not of my own making. You have sent it to me for Your own wise
   purposes--will You not bring me through it?" Another may say, "O Lord,
   I am very poor, yet this is not because I have been imprudent or
   extravagant, but because You have permitted it--so will You not help me
   in my time of need?" A Sister pleads, "O Lord, I am in deep distress.
   My dear husband has been taken away and I am left with many children
   and with very scanty means. But as You have put me into this furnace,
   will You not be with me in it and keep me from being consumed?" When a
   soldier is sent on a campaign, he is not expected to bear his own
   charges. And if the great Captain of Salvation has sent you out to
   fight for Him, He will meet your expenses. He will also cover your head
   in the day of battle and make you more than conqueror through His
   might. Did the Lord ever lay a heavier burden on any man than that man
   was able to bear unless He also gave him extra strength to enable him
   to bear it? Rest confident concerning the trial which God sends you,
   that He will also send you deliverance from it, or Divine Grace to
   glorify Him in it! If His left hand smites you, His right hand will
   support you. If He frowns upon you, today, He will smile upon you
   tomorrow. If He leads you into deep waters, He will bring you up again
   to the hills where He will gladden you with the light of His
   Countenance! The deeper your sorrows, the higher shall be your joys! As
   your tribulations abound, so also shall your consolations abound by
   Jesus Christ! The groans of earth shall be surpassed by the songs of
   Heaven and the woes of time shall be swallowed up in the hallelujahs of
   eternity! Therefore if in any of these senses evil comes down upon you
   from the Lord, I pray that He may give you the Grace to accept it and
   even to rejoice in it!

   III. Now we are to close by thinking of EXPECTATIONS WHICH WILL NOT END
   IN DISAPPOINTMENT.

   For instance, I expect, and so do you if you are the Lord's children,
   that God will keep His promises. It is not always so with men, for they
   make many promises which they never fulfill. There are men who are so
   rich and so reliable that their signature to a check is as good as gold
   to the full value of the check--and God's promise is His check which
   can be cashed at the Bank of Faith in every time of need! We are all
   too apt to rely upon our fellow men, even though they have failed us
   again and again. But we sometimes find it difficult to depend upon our
   God, although He has never failed anyone who has trusted Him. O
   Beloved, what wickedness lurks in that fact! If you believe every
   promise that God has given, you will be able to endorse the testimony
   that Joshua gave to the children of Israel just before he died, "You
   know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing has
   failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spoke concerning
   you; all are come to pass unto you and not one thing has failed
   thereof."

   Then next, expect much from the merits and work of the Lord Jesus
   Christ. If you have really believed in Him, expect to be justified by
   Him. Expect that He will answer every accusation that can be brought
   against you either now or at the last great Judgment Day. Expect also
   to be preserved and kept by Him. Expect that He will go before you as
   your Shepherd, making you to lie down in green pastures and leading you
   beside the still waters. Expect that He will plead for you in Heaven
   and that He will soon come to take you up to dwell at His right hand
   forever! You cannot expect too much of Christ--and large as your
   expectations may be--none of them shall be disappointed.

   And, Beloved, expect much from the work of the Holy Spirit If the
   Spirit of God has quickened you from your death in sin, what is there
   that He cannot and will not do? Are you in trouble? He can comfort you.
   Are you depressed? He can cheer you. Are you in the dark? He can
   enlighten you. Are you at this moment fighting against sin? He can
   enable you to gain the victory! I am sure that many of God's children
   do not expect half as much as they ought from the Holy Spirit. They
   seem to imagine that there are some sins that cannot be driven out of
   them! They do not, in the power of the Spirit, put the sword to the
   throat of all their sins. Yet this should be the constant aim of every
   Christian--to drive out the Ca-naanites and kill the last Amalekite
   with the edge of the sword! The Spirit of God is able to subdue the
   fiercest temper. He is able to impart activity to the most slothful
   nature. He is able to repress the wildest and most evil desires. He is
   able to excite us to those virtues which seem to be directly opposite
   to our natural temperaments and characters. "All things are possible to
   him who believes." If he will but wholly trust to the Holy Spirit, he
   shall be able to do great exploits in the war that has to be waged
   within his own heart and also in the fight against evil which is raging
   all around him!

   If time would permit, I might go on urging you to cherish expectations
   which are not likely to be disappointed, but I can only summarize them
   very briefly. Expect tonight that God will bless you as you offer up
   your evening prayer. Expect that the Lord will be with you tomorrow
   sustaining you amid all the cares and toils of the day. Expect for all
   the days of your active life that as your days, so shall your strength
   be. And when your declining years come, expect that consolation will be
   given to you to meet every emergency. In sickness, expect to receive
   sustaining Grace. In death, itself, expect the Lord's very special
   Presence. Expect a glorious Resurrection! Expect the triumph that you
   shall share with Christ in His millennial Glory. Expect an eternity of
   bliss with Him as He has promised, and rest assured that none of these
   expectations shall be disappointed!

   I fear that there are some here who have no right to cherish any of
   these expectations. You have probably had disappointments about many
   things. I cannot pity you very much concerning the trivial
   disappointments of this life--but if you do not seek the Savior where
   He is found, there is a disappointment in store for you that might well
   fill all Christian hearts with tender pity and compassion. There is a
   man who has lived a life of selfish pleasure. He has been clothed in
   scarlet and fine linen and has fared sumptuously every day. But all of
   a sudden the voice of God declares that he must die. What will be his
   horror when he sees all his treasures melting away and himself doomed
   to depart out of this world as naked as when he entered it? Imagine the
   case of the man who has been what he calls religious, who has attended
   to all the ceremonies of his church, or who has been orthodox after the
   fashion of the sect to which he belongs--but who has had no new birth
   and, consequently, none of the life of God in his soul--no indwelling
   Spirit, no vital connection with the Lord Jesus Christ, the one and
   only Savior! Yet he has expected to be ferried across the bridgeless
   river by one called Vain-Hope--and when the hour of death has come, God
   has opened his eyes to let him see his real position and the dread
   future that is awaiting him! Oh, the terror of that man when his vain
   and unfounded hopes are disappointed! We have read of some who have
   offered a great portion of their wealth if they might only be allowed
   to live another hour, but it

   was all in vain, for die they must! God save all of you, my dear
   Hearers, from such a doom as that! In order that it may be so, put not
   your trust in things below--be not like the inhabitants of Maroth who
   looked to the Philistines and the Egyptians to help them--and so waited
   in vain for the good that never came. But turn your eyes unto Him who
   says, "Look unto Me, and be you saved," and then your expectations
   shall not be disappointed. So may it be, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HEBREWS 4.

   (This Exposition belongs to sermon No. 3182, Volume 56--"Boldness at
   the Throne," but there was no space available for it there.

   Verse 1. Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering
   into His rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.Not only
   dread coming short, but dread the very appearanceof it! Oh, that we
   might now enter into that rest and so clearly enjoy it that there
   should not even be a seeming to come short of it!

   2. For unto us was the Gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the
   word preached did not profit them, not being

   mixed with faith in them that heard it [See Sermon #2089, Volume
   35--PROFITABLE MIXTURE.] They were not united to it by faith.
   Consequently, as they did not receive the Word, it was taken away from
   them.

   3. For we who have believed do enter into rest.[See Sermons #866,
   Volume 15--REST--and #2090, Volume 35--A DELICIOUS EXPERIENCE.] Faith
   brings us into this rest, even as unbelief shut them

   out.

   3. As He said, As Ihave sworn in My wrath they shall not enter into My
   rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the
   world. That is God's rest, the rest of a finished work--and into that
   rest many never enter. The work by which they might live forever, the
   finished work by which they might be saved, they refuse, and so they
   never enter into God's rest.

   4, 5. For He spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise,
   And God did rest the seventh day from all His works. And in this place
   again, they shall not enter into My rest There are many professing
   Christians who do not understand what it is to rest because the work of
   salvation is done. They do not even seem to know that the work is done!
   They understand not that dying word of the Lord Jesus, "It is
   finished." They think there is something still to be added to His work
   to make it effectual. But it is not so.

   6-8. Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they
   to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief, again
   He designates a certain day saying in David, Today after so long a
   time; as it is said, Today if you will hear the voice, harden not your
   hearts. For if Jesus had given them rest, then would He not afterward
   have spoken of another day. We read of this in the 95th Psalm, where
   David was urging those to whom he was writing to hear God's voice, and
   not be like the unbelievers in the wilderness, so that the rest still
   remained to be entered upon by somebody. Joshua had not given them
   rest, or else David would not have spoken of entering into rest.

   9, 10. There remains, therefore, a rest to the people of God. For he
   that is entered into His rest, he also has ceased from his own works,
   as God has from His. He says, "It is finished. I am no longer going to
   do my own works, I have done with them--I now trust the finished work
   of Christ--and that gives me rest. But as to all that wearied me,
   before, and made life a continual task and toil, it is now ended." God
   is not a cruel taskmaster to His people. He gives rest to those who
   trust in Him--and some of us have entered into that rest.

   11. Let us labor, therefore, to enter into that rest lest any man
   fallafter the same example of unbelief. Let us not repeat the story of
   unbelieving Israel in our own lives. Let us not live and die in the
   wilderness, but let us go in and take possession of the promised land,
   the promised rest, in the power of the Holy Spirit!

   12. For the Word of God is quick, and powerful and sharper than any
   two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
   spirit and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts
   and intents of the heart. This verse may be interpreted with reference
   to the Incarnate Word or to the Inspired Word--they are so closely
   united

   and related to one another that we need not attempt to separate them,
   but see Christ in the Word, and the Word in Christ--and learn that both
   Christ and the Word do for us all that the Apostle here declares!

   13. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight:
   but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we
   have to do. However great a revealer the Word of God may be, however
   clear a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, the God who
   gave the Word is even more so!

   14. Seeing then that we have a great High Priest that is passed into
   the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
   Shall we desert Him, now that He has gone into Heaven to represent us?
   Now that He has fought the fight and won the victory on our behalf, and
   gone up to Heaven as our Representative? God forbid!

   15. 16. For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the
   feeling of our infirmities; but was in all

   of charge, at http://www.spurgeongems.org.] Let us, therefore, come
   boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy and find
   Grace to help in time of need.

   as we are, yet without sin. [See Sermon #2143, Volume 36--THE

"A Song of My Beloved"

   (No. 3185)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "My Beloved is mine, and I am His: He feeds among the lilies. Until the
   day breaks and the shadows flee away, turn, my Beloved, and be You like
   a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether." Song of Solomon
   2:16,17.

   [Other Sermons by Mr. Spurgeon, upon parts of the same passage, are
   #1190, Volume 20--A SONG AMONG THE LILIES; #2442, Volume 41--"MY
   BELOVED IS MINE" and #2477, Volume 42--DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN.]

   IT has been well said that if there is a happy verse in the Bible, it
   is this one--"My Beloved is mine, and I am His: He feeds among the
   lilies." So peaceful, so full of assurance, so bursting with happiness
   and contentment is it, that it might well have been written by the same
   hand which penned the 23rd Psalm--"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not
   want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures: He leads me beside the
   still waters." The verse savors of Him who, just before He went to
   Gethsemane, said to His disciples, "Peace I leave with you, My peace I
   give unto you: not as the world gives, give I unto you...In the world
   you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the
   world." Let us ring the silver bell of this verse again, for its notes
   are exquisitely sweet! "My Beloved is mine, and I am His: He feeds
   among the lilies."

   Yet there is a shadow in the latter part of the text. The prospect is
   exceedingly fair and lovely--earth cannot show its superior--but it is
   not entirely a sunlit landscape! There is a cloud in the sky which
   casts a shadow over the scene. It does not dim it--everything is clear
   and stands out sharply and brightly--"My Beloved is mine, and I am
   His." That is clear enough, yet I say again that it is not altogether
   sunlight--there are shadows--"Until the day breaks and the shadows flee
   away." There is also a mention of the "mountains of Bether"--the
   mountains of division--and to have anything like division is
   bitterness. I see here a paschal lamb, but I see bitter herbs with it.
   I see the lily, but I think I see it still among the thorns. I see the
   fair and lovely landscape of assured confidence, but a shadow, just a
   slight shadow, takes away some of its glory. And he who sees it has to
   still look for something yet beyond--"till the day breaks and the
   shadows flee away."

   The text seems to me to indicate just this state of mind. Perhaps some
   of you may at this time exemplify it. You do not doubt your
   salvation--you know that Christ is yours. You are certain of that,
   albeit you may not be at present enjoying the light of your Savior's
   Countenance. You know that He is yours, but you are not feeding upon
   that precious fact. You realize your vital interest in Christ, so much
   so that you have no shadow of a doubt that you are His and He is
   yours--but still, His left hand is not under your head, nor does His
   right hand embrace you. A shade of sadness is cast over your heart,
   possibly by affliction, certainly by the temporary absence of your
   Lord. So even while exclaiming, "My Beloved is mine, and I am His," you
   are forced to fall on your knees and pray, "Until the day breaks and
   the shadows flee away, turn, my Beloved, and be You like a roe or a
   young hart upon the mountains of division."

   We may occupy the time profitably if God the Holy Spirit shall enable
   us in speaking upon these matters. We have here, first, a soul enjoying
   personal interest in the Lord Jesus Christ or, personal interest
   assured. We have, next, a soul taking the deepest interest in Christ
   and longing to know where He isor, the deepest interest evinced. And
   then we have a soul anxiously desiring present communion with Christ
   or, visible fellowship, conscious communion sought after.

   I. We have here, first, PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
   ASSURED.

   I do not mean to try to preach tonight. I should like my text to
   preach. And the way in which I should like it to preach would be to see
   how far we can get hold of it. How we can take it word by word and
   drink it in! Come to each

   word as to a well and sit down on the brink and drink a refreshing
   draught! Come to each word as to a palm tree and eat of the fruit
   thereof!

   The text begins with the words, "my Beloved." Come, Soul, can you
   venture to call Christ your Beloved? Certainly He should be beloved by
   you, for what has He not done for you? Favors rich and rare have been
   the gifts of His hands-- gifts purchased by His own most precious
   blood! If you do not love Him, my Heart, you are a most ungrateful
   thing, indeed! You are deceitful, rotten, loathsome above all things
   and desperately wicked, O my Heart, if Jesus, being your Savior, you do
   not love Him! He ought to be loved by the most of you here, for you
   profess to have been redeemed by His blood and adopted into the family
   of God through Him. You professed, when you were baptized, to be dead
   with Him-- and when you come to this Communion Table, tonight, you will
   profess that He is your meat and your drink, your life, your soul's
   stay and comfort! So, if you do not love Him, what shall I say to you?
   I will let you say it to yourselves--

   "A very wretch, Lord!I should prove,

   Had I no love for Thee--

   Rather than not my Savior love,

   Oh may I cease to be!"

   "My Beloved." He ought to be so and He has been so. There was a time
   when you and I did not love Him, but that time is over. We recollect
   the happy moment when first, by faith, we saw His face and heard Him
   say, "I have loved you with an everlasting love." Oh, the happiness of
   the day of conversion! You have not forgotten it. How alive and zealous
   some of you were then! In those first months when you were brought into
   the house of mercy and were washed and clothed, and had all your needs
   supplied out of the fullness that is treasured up in Christ Jesus, you
   did, indeed, love Him! You were not hypocrites, were you? And you used
   to sing with such force of voice as well as of heart--

   "Jesus, I love Your charming name,

   'Tis music to my ear--

   Gladly would I sound it out so loud

   That earth and Heaven should hear!" Yes, we did love Him, but we cannot
   stop at that--we do l ove Him! With all our faults, imperfections and
   frailties, the Lord, who knows all things, knows that we do love Him.
   Sometimes, Brothers and Sisters, it is not easy to know whether we love
   Christ, or not. I have heard many remarks about the hymn containing
   that line--

   "Do I love the Lord, or no?"

   but I believe that every honest Christian sometimes asks that question
   and I think one good way of getting it answered is to go and hear a
   faithful minister. Last Sabbath morning, I sat and listened to a very
   simple-minded preacher in a Wes-leyan Chapel. He was a most unsound
   Wesleyan, but a thoroughly sound Calvinistic Brother. And when he began
   to preach about the love of Jesus Christ, the tears streamed down my
   cheeks. I could not help letting them fall upon the sanded floor as I
   sat there--and I thought to myself, "Well, now, I do love the Savior."
   I had thought that perhaps I did not, but when I heard of Him and the
   preacher began to play upon my heartstrings, the music came! When I did
   but have Christ set before me, that woke up my soul if, indeed, it had
   been asleep before. When I heard of Him, though only in broken accents,
   I could not but feel that I did love Him and love Him better than life
   itself! I trust that it is true of many here that Christ is our
   "Beloved."

   But the text says, not only, "Beloved," but, "my Beloved is mine," as
   if the spouse took Him all to herself. It is the nature of love, you
   know, to monopolize. There is a remarkable passage in the third chapter
   of the prophecy of Hosea, which I need not quote except in outline,
   where the Prophet is bid to take one who had been unclean and unchaste,
   and to say to her, "You shall be for me, so will I also be for you."
   This was meant to be typical of what Christ does unto His Church. Our
   love goes gadding abroad unto 20 objects until Christ comes! And then
   He says, "You silly thing, now you shall fly abroad no more. Come, you
   dove, I will give you a new heart and my wounds shall be your dovecot,
   and you shall never wander away again. I will be altogether yours and
   you shall be altogether Mine--there shall be a monopoly between us. I
   will be married to you and you shall be married to Me. There shall be
   communion between us. I will be yours, you wandering sinner, as your
   Husband, and you shall be Mine."

   Every heart that has been subdued by Sovereign Grace takes Jesus Christ
   to be the chief Object of its love. We love our children, we love all
   our dear ones--God forbid that we should ever fail to love them--but,
   over and above them all, we must love our Lord. There is not one among
   us, I think, who would make it a matter of question which we would

   sooner part with--it would be a melancholy experience to have to follow
   the partner of one's bosom to the grave--but if it were a choice
   between wife and Savior, we could not deliberate for a moment! And as
   for the children of our love, whom we hope to see springing up to
   manhood and womanhood, it would be a sorry blow to us to have them laid
   low, but it would not take us a second to decide whether we should lose
   our Isaacs or lose our Jesus! No, we should not feel that they were
   lost if God took them from us, but we could not afford to think for a
   single instant of losing Him who is our everlasting All-in-All. The
   Christian, then, makes Christ his Beloved beyond all besides! Let other
   people love what they will, but as for him, he loves his Savior! He
   stands at the foot of the Cross and says, "This once-accursed tree is
   now the blessed bulwark of my confidence." He looks up to the Savior
   and He says, "Many see no beauty in Him that they should desire Him,
   but to me He is the chief among ten thousand, and the altogether
   lovely." Let the scholar take his classics, let the warrior take his
   weapons of war, let the lover take his tender words and his amatory
   lyrics, but as for the Christian, he takes the Savior! He takes the
   Lord Jesus to be to his Alpha and Omega, the beginning, the end, the
   midst, the All-in-All--and in Him he finds his soul's solace!

   Some people have thought that there is a tautology in the text when it
   says, "My Beloved is mine." Why, of course, if He is my Beloved, He is
   mine--what need is there to say that? Well, those who are acquainted
   with the Christian's experience know that all Believers are subject to
   many doubts and fears, and that they feel that they cannot make their
   assurance too sure, so they like to double their expressions of
   assurance when they can, so each of them says, "My Beloved is mine."
   There is no tautology--the speaker is only giving two strokes of the
   hammer to drive the nail home! It is put so that there can be no
   mistake about it, so that the spouse means what she is saying, and
   intends others to also understand it! "My Beloved is mine."

   But I think it may mean more than that because we may love a thing, and
   yet it may not be our own. A man may call money his Beloved, yet he may
   never get it. He may pursue it, but not be able to reach it. The lover
   of learning may court the love he covets in all the academies of the
   world, yet he may not be able to win the attainment of his desires. Men
   may love, and on their dying beds may have to confess that their
   Beloved is not theirs--but every Christian has that upon which his
   heart is set--h! has Christ! He loves Him and possesses Him, too.

   Besides, dear Friends, you know that there is a time when men are not
   able to say that their Beloved is theirs. He who has been most wealthy
   or most wise can take neither his wealth nor his wisdom with him to the
   tomb. And when the sinner who died and was buried, wakes up in another
   world, Croesus will be as poor as Lazarus--and the wisest man without
   Christ will find himself devoid of all wisdom when he wakes up in the
   day of Resurrection! They may stretch out their hands, but they will
   only clutch emptiness and have to cry, "Our Beloved is not ours!" But
   when we shall wake up in the image of Christ and shall see Him--whether
   we shall fall asleep or whether we shall be changed, in either case we
   shall be present with Him--then shall each Believer say, "Yes, He is
   mine, still mine! I have Him, truly have Him! 'My Beloved is mine.'" I
   am inclined to think that if a man can truly say this, he can say the
   grandest thing that ever man said, "My Beloved is mine." "Look," says
   the rich man, "do you see far away beyond those stately oaks, yonder?
   Do you see as far as that church spire? Well, as far as you can see,
   that is all mine!" "Ah," says Death, as he lays his bony hand upon the
   man, "Six feet of earth, that is yours." "Look," says the scholar, as
   he points to the volumes on his shelves, "I have searched through all
   these and all the learning that is there is mine." "Ah," says Death,
   again, as he smites him with his cold hand, "who can tell the
   difference between the skull of the learned and the skull of the
   ignorant when the worm has emptied them both?" But the Christian, when
   he can point upwards and say, "I love my Savior," has a possession
   which is surely his forever! Death may come, and willcome, even to him,
   but all that Death can do is open the door to admit the Christian into
   still fuller enjoyment of that which was already his. "My Beloved is
   mine." So although I may have but little, I will be satisfied with it!
   And though I may be so poor that the world will pass me by and never
   notice me, yet I will live quite content in the most humble possible
   obscurity because, "my Beloved is mine," and He is more than all the
   world to me! "Whom have I in Heaven but You? And there is none upon
   earth that I desire beside You."

   Now I want to stop and see whether we have really got as far as this.
   How many of us have said, "My Beloved is mine"? I am afraid there may
   be some poor Christian here who says, "Ah, I cannot say that." Now, my
   dear Hearer, I will ask you a question--Do you cling to Christ? Is He
   your only hope? If so, then He is yours! When the tide goes down, have
   you ever seen the limpets clinging to the rocks, or holding fast,
   perhaps, to the pier? Now, is that what your faith does with Christ? Do
   you cling to Him? Is He all your trust? Do you rest on Him? Well then,
   if you do, you do not need any other mark or sign--that one is quite
   enough--if you are clinging to Christ, then Christ is yours! She who
   did but touch the hem of His garment received the virtue which came out
   of Him. If you can cling to Him and, putting away every other
   confidence and renouncing all other trust, can say, "Yes, if I perish,
   I will cling to Christ alone," then do not let a single doubt come in
   to take away the comfort of your soul, for your Beloved is yours!

   Or perhaps, to put it another way, I may ask you--Do you love Jesus?
   Does His name wake up the echoes of your heart? See the little child in
   its mother's arms--you want to take it for a little while, but no, it
   will not come away from its mother. And if you still want to take it,
   it puts its little arms around its mother's neck and clings there. You
   could pull it away, perhaps, but you have not the heart to do so. It
   clings to its mother and that is the evidence to you that she is its
   mother. Do you cling to Christ in that way? And though you feel that
   the devil would pull you away from Christ if he could, do you still
   cling to Him as best you can? Do you remember what John Bunyan said
   about the prisoner whom Mr. Greatheart rescued from Giant Slay-Good's
   clutches? Mr. Feeble-Mind said, "When he had got me into his den, since
   I went not with him willingly, I believed I would come out alive
   again." Is that the case with you? Are you willing to have Christ if
   you can have Him? Are you unwilling to give Him up? Then you shall
   never give Him up! He is yours! Do not think that Christ needs a high
   degree of faith to establish a union between Himself and a sinner, for
   a grain of mustard seed of faith is sufficient for salvation, though
   certainly not for the highest degree of comfort. If you can but trust
   Christ and love Christ, then let not Satan stop you from saying, in the
   words of the text, "My Beloved is mine."

   Well, we have got so far, but we must remember the next words, "Iam
   His." Now this is true of every Christian. I am His by Christ having
   made me His. I am His by choice--He elected me. I am His by His
   Father's gift--God gave me to Him. I am His by purchase--He bought me
   with His blood. I am His by power, for His Spirit has won me. I am His
   by my own dedication, for I have vowed myself unto Him. I am His by
   profession, for I have joined with His people. I am His now by my own
   deliberate choice of Him, moved by His Grace to choose Him! Every
   Christian here knows that this is true--Christ is yours and you are
   Christ's. You are the sheep of His pasture. You are the partners of His
   love. You are members of His body. You are branches of His stem. You
   belong to Him!

   But there are some persons who get at a more practical meaning of this
   sentence, "I am His," than others do. You know that in the Church of
   Rome they have certain orders of men and women who devote themselves to
   various benevolent, charitable, or superstitious work--and who come to
   be especially considered the servants of the Lord Jesus. Now, we have
   never admired this form of brotherhoods and sisterhoods, but the spirit
   of the thing is just that which ought to enter into the heart of every
   Christian man and woman. You members of Christian Churches, if you are
   what you ought to be, are wholly consecrated to the Savior. "Pure
   religion and undefiled before God and the Father" should be practiced
   by the whole Church of Christ, not merely by certain "orders" and then
   to be called "religious"! Every Christian woman is "a sister of mercy."
   We hear of men who belong to the order of Passionists, but every
   believing man ought to be of the order of Passionists, moved by the
   passion of the Savior to consecrate himself to the Savior's work!

   "I am His." I would like to have you take this for your motto, you
   professed Christians, if you can honestly do so. When you wake in the
   morning, breathe a short prayer while you are dressing, and before
   bowing the knee, feeling, "I am Christ's, and the first thing when I
   wake must be a word with Him and for Him." When you go abroad into the
   world, I want you to feel that you cannot trade as other men trade,
   that you cannot imitate their tricks and sharp practices because
   something whispers within your heart, "I am His! I am His! I am
   different from other men! They may do what they will, for their
   judgment is yet to come, but I am different from them, for I am
   Christ's." I wish all Christians felt that the life they live is given
   to them that they may glorify Christ by it. Oh, if the wealth that is
   in the Christian Church were but devoted to God's cause, there would
   never be any lack of the means of sustaining missions, or of building
   Houses of Prayer in the dark localities of London! If some rich men
   gave to the cause of Christ as some poor men and women that I know of,
   do, there would never be any lack in the treasury! I have sometimes
   rejoiced over some of you. I have had to bless God that I have seen in
   this Church, Apostolic piety. I have known men and women who, out of
   their little, have given almost all that they had and whose one
   objective in life has been to spend and be spent for Christ--and I have
   rejoiced over them. But there are others of you who have not given a
   tithe, no, not a fiftieth part of what you have, to the cause of
   Christ. Yet, perhaps, you stand up and sing--

   "I love my God with zeal so great That I could give Him all."

   Stop that! Do not sing lies, for you know very well that you would not
   give Him all and do not give Him all! And you also know very well that
   you would think it the most absurd thing in all the world if you were
   to give Him all, or even to dream of doing so! Oh, for more
   consecration! We are, most of us, up to our ankles in our
   religion--very few of us are up to our knees. But oh, for the man that
   swims in it, who has got off the earth altogether and now swims in
   consecration, living wholly unto Him who loved him and gave Himself for
   him!

   I am afraid I shall have to stop here and ask the question, without
   getting any answer to it--How far can we get toward this second
   sentence, "My Beloved is mine, and I am His"? Do you feel as if you
   could not say that? Do you feel that you cannotsay it? Then let this be
   your prayer, "Lord, if I have not yet done all that I can do. If there
   is anything left which I might have done for You, and which I have not
   done, give me Grace that I may do all I can for You and give all I can
   to You!" There ought not to be an unconsecrated hair on a Christian's
   head, nor an unconsecrated drop of blood in his veins. Christ gave
   Himself wholly for us--He deserves that we should give ourselves wholly
   to Him! Where reserve begins, there Satan's dominion begins, for what
   is not Christ's is the property of the flesh, and the property of the
   flesh is the property of Satan! Oh, may the spiritual consecration be
   so perfect in each one of us that if we live, we may live unto
   Christ--or if we die, it may still be unto Him! I hope, though we may
   have to make many grave confessions, that we can still say, "My Beloved
   is mine, and I am His." If He stood here at this moment. If we could
   just clear a space and all of a sudden He should come and stand in our
   midst, with His wounds still visible, it would be so sweet to be able
   to then say, "My Beloved is mine, and I am His." But I am afraid that
   in His Presence we would have to say, "Jesus, forgive us. We are Yours,
   but we have not acted as if we were. We have stolen from You what was
   Your purchase and what You have the right to keep. From this day may we
   bear in our body the marks of the Lord Jesus and may we be wholly
   Yours!"

   II. I cannot say much upon the second part of the subject, for our time
   is already nearly gone. THE SOUL, BEING ASSURED OF ITS PERSONAL
   INTEREST IN CHRIST, LONGS TO KNOW WHERE HE IS.

   "Where is He?" asks the soul, and the answer comes from the text, "He
   feeds among the lilies." The worldling cares not where Christ is, but
   that is the Christian's one subject of thought--

   "Where He is gone I gladly would know

   That I might seek and find Him, too." Jesus is gone, then, among the
   lilies--among those snow-white saints who bloom in the garden of
   Heaven--those golden lilies that are round about the Throne of God! He
   is there in--

   "Jerusalem the golden

   With milk and honey blest"-- and it makes us long to be there that we
   may feed with Him among the lilies. But, still, there are many of His
   lilies here below, those virgin souls who--

   "Wherever the Lamb does lead,

   From His footsteps never depart." If we would find Christ, we must get
   into communion with His people. We must came to the ordinances with His
   saints, for though He does not feed on the lilies, He feeds among
   them--and there, perhaps, we may meet with Him. You are here, tonight,
   dear Friends, many of you members of this Church, and some of you
   members of other Churches, and you have come to the place where Christ
   feeds His flock. Now that He feeds among the lilies, look for Him! At
   the Communion Table, do not merely partake of the elements, but look
   for Him! Look through the bread and the wine to His flesh and blood of
   which they are the symbols. Care not for my poor words, but for Him!
   And as to anything else of which you have been thinking, get beyond
   that unto Him. "He feeds among the lilies," so look for Him where His
   saints gather in His name!

   If you would meet with Him, look, too, in the blessed lily beds of
   Scripture. Each Book of the Bible seems to be full of lilies, yet you
   must never be satisfied merely with Scripture, but must get to the
   Christ of Scripture, the Word of God, the sum and substance of the
   Revelation of the Most High! "He feeds among the lilies." That is where
   He is to be found. Lord Jesus come and feed us among the lilies
   tonight! Come and feed our hungry souls and we will bless Your holy
   name!

   III. I must leave that part of the subject unfinished because I want to
   speak of THE SOUL, ASSURED OF CHRIST'S LOVE, DESIRING HIS CONSCIOUS
   PRESENCE. "Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, turn, my
   Beloved, and be You like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of
   Bether."

   You observe that the soul speaks here of the day breaking. All of us
   who love the Lord have to look for daybreak, but the sinner has a night
   to come. Sinner, this is your day! And when you die, that will be your
   long and awful night-- unbroken by a single star of hope! But
   Christian, this is your night, the darkest period that you will ever
   have--but your day will break! Yes, the Lord will come in His Glory, or
   else you shall sleep in Him and then your day shall break. When the
   Resurrection trumpet shall sound, the Day of the Lord will be darkness
   and not light to the sinner, but to you it will be an everlasting
   daybreak! Perhaps at the present moment your life is wrapped in
   shadows. You are poor, and poverty casts a shadow. You have a sick one
   at home, or perhaps you are sickly in body--that is a shadow to you.
   And the reflection of your sin is another shadow, but when the day
   breaks the shadows will flee away! No poverty then! No sin then, which
   is better still! And--

   "No groans to mingle with the songs Which warble from immortal
   tongues."

   Brothers and Sisters, it is so sweet to know that our best things are
   ahead. O Sinner, you are leaving your best things behind and you are
   going to your worst things! But the Christian is going to his best
   things. His turn is coming. He will have the best of it before long,
   for the shadows will flee away! No longer shall he be vexed, and
   grieved, and troubled, but he shall be eternally in the light, for the
   shadows shallflee away!

   While the shadows last, you perceive that the soul asks Jesus Christ to
   turn, as though He had withdrawn His face from her. She says, "Have you
   turned away from me, my Master? Then turn to me again. Have I grieved
   and vexed you by growing worldly, carnal, careless, reckless? Then turn
   to me, my Lord. Have You been angry with me? Oh, love me! Have You not
   said that Your anger may endure for a moment, but that Your love is
   everlasting? In a little wrath You have hidden Your face from me, but
   oh, now turn unto me!" You know that the proper state for a Christian
   to be in is not a state in which Christ turns away His smiling face,
   but the state in which Christ's love is beaming full in His face. I
   know that some of you think it is best for you to be in the shade but,
   Beloved, do not think so! You need not have shadows forever--you may
   have the Presence of Christ even now to rejoice in! And I would have
   you ambitious to get two heavens--a Heaven below and a Heaven
   above--Christ here and then Christ there! Christ here making you as
   glad as your heart can be and the Christ forever filling you with all
   the fullness of God. May we seek after that double blessing and may we
   get it!

   Then the soul says, "Turn, my Beloved, and be You like a roe or a young
   hart upon the mountains of Bether." Dr. Thomson, who wrote The Land and
   the Book, tells us that he thinks he knows the mountains of Bether. It
   matters little whether he does or does not, but he has seen the roes
   and the harts skipping over the precipices. Certainly those wild
   creatures that are accustomed to craggy rocks will go where human
   footsteps would not dare to follow. And such is the love of Jesus
   Christ! Our love is easily turned aside. If we are badly treated, we
   soon forget those who seemed to be so fond of us. But Christ is like a
   roe or a young hart and He skips over the mountains of our sins and all
   the dividing mountains of our unbelief and ingratitude which might keep
   Him away. Like a young hart, He skips over them as though they were
   nothing at all, and so hastens to have communion with us. There is the
   idea of fleetness here--the roe goes swiftly, almost like the
   lightning's flash, and so does the Savior come to the soul in need! He
   can lift you up from the lowest state of spiritual sorrow to the
   highest position of spiritual joy--may He do so! Oh, cry to Him! Cry to
   Him! There is nothing that means so much to a mother than the voice of
   her child, and there is nothing that means so much to Christ than the
   voice of His dear people, so come to Him! Say, "Savior, show Your love
   to me. Dear Savior, do not hide Yourself from Your own flesh. I love
   you. I cannot live without You. I am grieved to think that I should
   have driven You away. Come to me! Come to me! Return to me and make me
   glad in Your Presence." Cry thus to Him and He will come to you!

   And you, poor Sinner, who have never comfortably seen His
   face--remember that there is life for a look at Him! God give you
   Grace, now, to trust Him--and may you see His face, here, so that you
   may see Him hereafter with everlasting joy!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 THESSALONIANS1.

   [This exposition belongs to Sermon #3179, Volume 56--A COMPREHENSIVE
   BENEDICTION--but there was not sufficient space available for its
   insertion there.]

   Verse 1. Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the
   Thessalonians. Paul loved to associate his fellow workers with himself
   when writing to his Brothers and Sisters in Christ. Although he had a
   superior experience to theirs, he put Silvanus, and Timothy, his own
   son in the faith, with him as his fellow Evangelists in writing to "the
   church of the Thessalonians."

   1. In God our Father. What a wonderful expression! The Church is in God
   as God is in the Church! What a blessed dwelling place for the people
   of God in all generations. "In God our Father."

   I, 2. And the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace unto you, and peace, from God
   our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the Apostle's usual
   salutation when he is writing to a Christian Church. When he is writing
   to a minister, it is, "Grace, mercy, and peace," for God's most
   prominent servants especially need great mercy on account of their
   heavy responsibilities and many shortcomings. But to the Church, Paul's
   greeting is, "Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the
   Lord Jesus Christ."

   3. We are bound to thank Godalways foryou, brethren, as it is meet,
   because that your faith [See Sermons #205, Volume 4--A

   LECTURE FOR LITTLE-FAITH; #1856, Volume 31--THE HISTORY OF LITTLE-FAITH
   and #1857, Volume 31--THE NECESSITY OF GROWING FAITH] grows
   exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other
   abounds. What a kind of sacred network Christian love makes,
   intertwisting every believer in Christ with every other Believer! "The
   love of every one of you all toward each other abounds." Oh, that this
   might really be the case in all the Churches of our Lord Jesus Christ!

   4, 5. So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your
   patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you
   endure: which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God. One
   of the clearest proofs of the judgment to come is to be found in the
   present sufferings of the saints through persecutions and tribulations,
   for if they, for the very reason that they love God, have to suffer
   here, there must be a future state and time for rectifying all this
   that is now so wrong!

   5-7. That you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God for which you
   suffer: seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
   tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled rest
   with us. For us who believe in Jesus there is a long Sabbath yet to
   come, to be spent with the Apostles and the other holy ones around the
   Throne of God and of the Lamb, even as Paul wrote to the Hebrews,
   "There remains, therefore, a rest to the people of

   God."

   7-11. When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with His mighty
   angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and
   that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be
   punished with everlasting destruction from the Presence of the Lord,
   and from the Glory of His power, when He shall come to be glorified in
   His saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our
   testimony among you was believed) in that day. Therefore we also pray
   always for you. The very people in whom Paul gloried, and over whom he
   rejoiced, were those for whom he continued to pray! And he did well,
   for the highest state of Grace needs preserving--and there is a
   possibility of going beyond the utmost height to which any have yet
   attained. Hence Paul says, "Therefore we also pray always for you"--

   II, 12. That our God would countyou worthy ofthis calling, and fulfill
   all the goodpleasure of His goodness, and the work of faith with power:
   that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you
   in Him, according to the Grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Peter's Shortest Prayer

   (No. 3186)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER
   2, 1873.

   "Lord, save me." Matthew 14:30.

   I am going to talk about the characteristics of this prayer in the hope
   that there may be many who have never yet prayed aright, who may make
   this their own prayer, tonight, so that from many a person here present
   this cry may silently go up, "Lord, save me."

   Where did Peter pray this prayer? It was not in a place set apart for
   public worship, or in his usual place for private prayer. He prayed
   this prayer just as he was sinking in the water! He was in great peril,
   so he cried out, "Lord, save me." It is well to assemble with God's
   people for prayer if you can, but if you cannot go up to His house, it
   matters little, for prayer can ascend to Him from anywhere in the
   world! It is well to have a special spot where you pray at home--
   probably most of us have a certain chair by which we kneel to pray and
   we feel that we can talk to God most freely there. At the same time, we
   must never allow ourselves to become the slaves even of such a good
   habit as that--we must always remember that if we really want to find
   the Lord by prayer--

   "Wherever we seek Him, He is found, And everyplace is hallowed ground."
   We may pray to God when engaged in any occupation if it is a lawful
   one. And if it is not, we have no business to be in it! If there is
   anything we do over which we cannot pray, we ought never dare to do it
   again. And if there is any occupation concerning which we have to say,
   "We could not pray while engaged in it," it is clear that the
   occupation is a wrong one.

   The habit of daily prayer must be maintained. It is well to have
   regular hours of devotion and to resort to the same place for prayer,
   as far as possible. Still, the spiritof prayer is better than the
   habitof prayer. It is better to be able to pray at all times than to
   make it a rule to pray at certain times and seasons. A Christian is
   more fully grown in Divine Grace when he prays about everything than he
   would be if he only prayed under certain conditions and circumstances.
   I always feel that there is something wrong if I go without prayer for
   even half an hour in the day. I cannot understand how a Christian can
   go from morning to evening without prayer. I cannot comprehend how he
   lives and how he fights the battle of life without asking the guardian
   care of God while the arrows of temptation are flying so thickly around
   him! I cannot imagine how he can decide what to do in times of
   perplexity, how he can see his own imperfections or the faults of
   others without feeling constrained to say, all day long, "O Lord, guide
   me, O Lord, forgive me! O Lord, bless my friend!" I cannot think how he
   can be continually receiving mercies from the Lord without saying, "God
   be thanked for this new token of His Grace! Blessed be the name of the
   Lord for what He is doing for me in His abounding mercy! O Lord, still
   remember me with the favor that You show unto Your people!" Do not be
   content, dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, unless you can pray
   everywhere and at all times--and so obey the Apostolic injunction,
   "Pray without ceasing."

   I have already reminded you, dear Friends, that Peter prayed his prayer
   when he was in circumstances of imminent danger. Beginning to sink, he
   cried, saying, "Lord, save me!" "But," asks someone, "ought he not to
   have prayed before?" Of course he ought--but if he had not done so, it
   was not too late! Do not say concerning any trouble, "Now I am so
   deeply in it, I cannot go to God about it." Why not? "Is anything too
   hard for the Lord?" It would have been well if the disciples had prayed
   before the first rough breath of the tempest began to toss their little
   boat, yet it was not too late to pray when the vessel seemed as if it
   must go down. As long as you have a heart to pray, God has an ear to
   hear. Look

   at Peter--he is "beginning to sink." The water is up to his knees, it
   is up to his waist, it is up to his neck, but it is not yet too late
   for him to cry, "Lord, save me!" And he has no sooner said it, than the
   hand of Jesus is stretched out to catch him and to guide him to the
   boat. So, Christian, cry to God though the devil tells you it is no use
   to cry! Cry to God even if you are beneath the tempter's foot! Say to
   Satan, "Rejoice not against me, O my enemy--when I fall, I shall
   arise." But do not forget to cry to the Lord! Cry to God for your
   children even when they are most ungodly, when their ungodliness almost
   breaks your heart. Cry to God on behalf of those whom you are teaching
   in the Sunday school, even when you seem to think that their characters
   are developing in the worst possible form, still pray for them! Never
   mind though the thing you ask for them should appear to be an
   impossibility, for God "is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
   that we ask or think."

   I would also say to any unconverted person who is here, under
   conviction of sin--Dear Friend, if you are beginning to sink, yet still
   pray. If your sins stare you in the face and threaten to drive you to
   despair, yet still draw near to God in prayer. Though it seems as if
   Hell had opened its mouth to swallow you up, yet still cry unto God.
   "While there's life, there is hope."--

   "While the lamp holds out to burn, The vilest sinner may return"--

   and the vilest sinner who returns shall find that God is both able and
   willing to save him! Never believe that lie of Satan that prayer will
   not prevail with God. Only go as the publican did, beating upon your
   breast and crying, "God be merciful to me a sinner," and rest assured
   that God is waiting to be gracious to you.

   I cannot help feeling that Peter's short, simple prayer was uttered in
   a most natural tone of voice--"Lord, save me." Let us always pray in
   just such a way as the Spirit of God dictates to us and as the deep
   sorrow and humiliation of our heart naturally suggest to us. Many men
   who pray in public get into the habit of using certain tones in prayer
   that are anything but natural. And I am afraid that some even in
   private fail to pray naturally. Any language that is not natural is
   bad--the best tone is that which a man uses when he is speaking
   earnestly, and means what he says--that is the right way to pray. Speak
   as if you meant it--do not whine it, or cant it, or intone it--but pour
   it out of your soul in the most simple, natural fashion that you can.
   Peter was in too great peril to put any fine language into his prayer!
   He was too conscious of his danger to consider how he might put his
   words together--he just expressed the strong desire of his soul in the
   simplest manner possible--"Lord, save me!" And that prayer was heard!
   And Peter was saved from drowning, just as a sinner will be saved from
   Hell if he can pray after the same fashion.

   I. Now, coming to Peter's prayer, itself, and suggesting that it is a
   suitable prayer for all who are able to pray at all, my first
   observation upon it is that IT WAS A VERY BRIEF PRAYER.

   There were only three words in it. "Lord, save me." I believe that the
   excellence of prayer often consists in its brevity. You must have
   noticed the extreme brevity of most of the prayers that are preserved
   in Scripture. One of the longest is the prayer of our Savior recorded
   by John which would, I suppose, have occupied about five minutes. And
   there is the prayer of Solomon at the dedication of the Temple which
   may have taken six minutes. Almost all the other prayers in the Bible
   are very short ones and, probably, in our public services, we pray far
   longer than all of them put together! This may, perhaps, be excused
   when there are many petitions to be presented by one person on behalf
   of a large congregation. But at our Prayer Meetings, where there are
   many to speak, I am certain that the longer the prayer is, the worse it
   is. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. The Spirit of God
   sometimes inspires a man in such a way that if he would keep on praying
   all night, we would be glad to join with him in that holy exercise!
   But, as a general rule, the Spirit of God does no such thing. There are
   some who pray longest when they have the least to say, and only go on
   repeating certain pious phrases which become almost meaningless by
   monotonous reiteration. Remember, dear Friends, when you are praying,
   whether in public or in private, that you have not to teach the Lord a
   system of theology--He knows far more about that than you do! You have
   no need to explain to the Lord all the experience that a Christian
   ought to have, for He knows that far better than you do! And there is
   no necessity for you always to go round all the various agencies and
   institutions and mission stations. Tell the Lord what is in your heart
   in as few words as possible--and so leave time and opportunity for
   others to do the same.

   I wonder if anyone here ever says, "I have no time for prayer." Dear
   Friend, dare you leave your house in the morning without bowing the
   knee before God? Can you venture to close your eyes at night and wear
   the image of death, with-

   out first commending yourself to the keeping of God during the hours of
   unconsciousness in sleep? I do not understand how you can live such a
   careless life as that! But, surely, you did not really mean that you
   had no time to offer such a prayer as Peter's, "Lord, save me." How
   much time does that take? Or this--"God be merciful to me a sinner." If
   you realized your true condition in God's sight, you would find time
   for prayer somehow or other, for you would feel that you must pray! It
   never occurred to Peter, as he was beginning to sink, that he had no
   time for prayer. He felt that he must pray--his sense of danger forced
   him to cry to Christ, "Lord, save me." And if you feel as you should
   feel, your sense of need will drive you to prayer and you will never
   again say, "I have no time for prayer." It is not a matter of time so
   much as a matter of heart--if you have the heart to pray, you will find
   the time.

   I would urge you to cultivate the habit of praying briefly all day. I
   have told you before of the Puritan who, in a debate, was observed to
   be taking notes. But when they were afterwards examined, it was found
   that there was nothing on the paper except these words, "More light,
   Lord! More light, Lord! More light, Lord!" He needed light upon the
   subject under discussion and, therefore, he asked the Lord for it! That
   is the way to pray. During the day, you can pray, "Give me more Grace,
   God. Subdue my temper, Lord. Tell me, O my God, what to do in this
   case! Lord, direct me. Lord, save me." Pray thus and you will be
   imitating the good example of brevity in prayer which our text sets
   before you.

   II. Notice next, that brief as Peter's prayer was, IT WAS WONDERFULLY
   COMPREHENSIVE AND ADAPTED FOR USE ON MANY DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. "Lord,
   save me."

   It covered all the needs of Peter at that time, and he might have
   continued to use it as long as he lived. When his Master told him that
   Satan desired to have him that he might sift him as wheat, he might
   well have prayed, "Lord, save me." When he had denied his Master and
   had gone out and wept bitterly, it would have been well for him to
   pray, "Lord, save me." When he was afterwards journeying to and from
   preaching the Gospel, he could still pray, "Lord, save me." And when,
   at last, he was led out to be crucified for Christ's sake, he could
   hardly find a better prayer than this with which to close his
   life--"Lord, save me."

   Now, as Peter found this prayer so suitable for him, I commend it to
   each one of you. Have you been growing rich lately? Then you will be
   tempted to become proud and worldly. So pray, "Lord, save me from the
   evils that so often go with riches. You are giving me this wealth, help
   me to be a good steward of it and not to make an idol of it." Or are
   you getting poor? Is your business proving a failure? Are your little
   savings almost gone? Well, there are perils connected with poverty, so
   pray, "Lord, save me from becoming envious or discontented. Let me be
   willing to be poor rather than do anything wrong in order to get
   money." Do you, dear Friend, feel that you are not living as near to
   God as you once did? Is the chilling influence of the world having its
   effect on you? Then pray, "Lord, save me." Have you fallen into some
   sin which you fear may bring disgrace upon your profession? Well then,
   before that sin grows greater, cry, "Lord, save me." Have you come to a
   place where your feet have well-near slipped? The precipice is just
   before you and you feel that if some mightier power than your own does
   not interpose, you will fall to your serious hurt, if not to your
   destruction. Then at once breathe the prayer, "Lord, save me." I can
   commend this prayer to you when you are upon the stormy sea, but it
   will be equally suitable to you upon the dry land--"Lord, save me!" I
   can commend it as suitable to you when you are near the gates of death,
   but it is just as much adapted to you when you are in vigorous
   health--"Lord, save me!" And if you can add to the prayer, "And, Lord,
   save my children, and my kinsfolk, and my neighbors," it will be even
   better! Still, for yourself, personally, it is an admirable prayer to
   carry about with you wherever you go. "Lord, save me."

   III. Peter's prayer had a third excellence, IT WAS VERY DIRECT.

   It would not have done for Peter, just then, to have used the many
   titles which rightly belong to Christ, or to have been asking for a
   thousand things. But he went straight to the point of his immediate
   need and cried, "Lord, save me." When one of our dear friends, who has
   lately gone to Heaven, was very ill, one of his sons prayed with him.
   He began in a very proper way, "Almighty Father, Maker of Heaven and
   earth, our Creator"--but his sick father stopped him and said, "My dear
   boy, I am a poor sinner and I need God's mercy. Say, 'Lord, save him.'"
   He wanted his son to get to the point. And I can sympathize with him!
   Often, when some of our dear Brothers and Sisters have been praying
   here, and have been beating about the bush, I have wished that they
   would come to the point and ask for what they really needed. They have
   kept on walking round the house, instead of knocking at the door and
   seeking to enter! Peter's prayer shows us how to go directly to the
   very heart of the matter. "Lord, save me."

   Many persons fail to receive answers to their prayers because they will
   not go straight to God and confess the sins that they have committed.
   There was a member of a Christian Church who had, on one occasion,
   fallen very shamefully through drink. He was very penitent and he asked
   his pastor to pray for him--but he would not say what his sin had been.
   The pastor prayed, and then told the Brother to pray. The poor man
   said, "Lord, you know that I have erred, and done wrong," and so on,
   making a sort of general confession, but that brought him no peace of
   mind. He felt that he could not go away like that, so he knelt down
   again, and said, "Lord, you know that I was drunk. It was a shameful
   sin that I committed, but I am truly grieved for it. O Lord, forgive
   me, for Jesus' sake!" And before his prayer was finished, he had found
   peace because he had plainly confessed his sin to God and had not
   sought to hide it any longer. You remember that David could get no
   peace until he came to the point and prayed, "Deliver me from
   bloodguiltiness, O God, You God of my salvation." Before that, he had
   tried to smother his great sin--but there was no rest for his
   conscience until he had made a full confession of his guilt! And after
   that he could say, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken
   and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise." Let our prayers,
   whether for ourselves or others, and especially our confessions of sin,
   go straight to the point--and not go beating about the bush. If any of
   you have been using forms of prayer which have not obtained for you any
   answers to your supplications, put them all aside, and just go and tell
   the Lord plainly what you need. Your prayer will then probably be
   something like this, "O God, I am a lost sinner! I have been careless
   about Divine things. I have listened to the Gospel, but I have not
   obeyed it. Lord, forgive me, save me, make me Your child and let me and
   my household, too, be Yours forever." That is the way to pray so that
   God will hear and answer you.

   IV. Another characteristic of Peter's prayer was that IT WAS A VERY
   SOUND DOCTRINAL PRAYER. "Lord, save, me."

   Peter does not appear to have had any idea of saving himself from
   drowning. He does not seem to have thought that there was sufficient
   natural buoyancy about him to keep him afloat or that he could swim to
   the ship. But, "beginning to sink, he cried, 'Lord, save me.'" One of
   the hardest tasks in the world is to get a man to give up all
   confidence in himself and from his heart, pray, "Lord, save me."
   Instead of doing that, he says, "O Lord, I do not feel as I ought. I
   need to feel my need more, I need to feel more joy, I need to feel more
   holiness." You see, he is putting feelings in place of faith! He is, as
   it were, laying down a track along which he wants God to walk instead
   of walking in the way which God has marked out for all who desire to be
   saved! Another man is seeking to reform himself and so to make himself
   fit for Heaven. And he prays in harmony with that idea and, of course,
   gets no answer. I like to hear such a prayer as this, "O Lord, I cannot
   save myself and I do not ask You to save me in any way that I
   prescribe. Lord, save me anyway, only do save me! I am satisfied to be
   saved by the precious blood of Jesus. I am satisfied to be saved by the
   regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. I know I must be born-again if I
   am ever to enter Heaven--quicken me, O you ever-blessed Spirit! I know
   I must give up my sins. Lord, I do not want to keep them--save me from
   them by Your Grace, I humbly entreat You. I know that only You can do
   this work. I cannot lift even a finger to help You in it, so save me,
   Lord, for Your great mercy's sake!" This is sound doctrinal Truth of
   God--salvation all of Grace, not of man, nor by men--"not of blood, nor
   of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." This is
   salvation according to the eternal purpose of God, by the effectual
   working of the Holy Spirit, through the substitutionary Sacrifice of
   Jesus Christ! When a sinner its willing to accept salvation on God's
   terms, then the prayer shall ascend acceptably to the Most High! "Lord,
   save me."

   V. Notice, also, that PETER'S PRAYER WAS A VERY PERSONAL ONE. "Lord,
   save me."

   Peter did not think of anybody else just then--when a soul is under
   concern about its eternal interests, it had better at first confine its
   thoughts to itself and pray, "Lord, save me." Yes, and in the
   Christian's life, there will come times when he had better, for a
   while, forget all others and simply pray, "Lord, save me." Here we are,
   a great congregation gathered together from very various motives and,
   perhaps, some here who are not yet personally interested in Christ--
   yet we are vaguely hoping that God will bless somebody in this
   assembly. But if the Holy Spirit shall begin to work upon some
   individual heart and conscience, the convicted one will begin to pray,
   "Lord, save me. I hear of many others being brought to Jesus but, Lord,
   save me. My dear sister has been converted and has made a profession of
   her faith but, Lord, save me. I had a godly mother, who has gone Home
   to Glory--and my dear father is walking in Your fear--let not their son
   be a castaway. Lord, save me!"

   I entreat everyone here to pray this personal prayer, and I beg you who
   do love the Lord to join me in pleading with Him that it may be so. I
   see some little girls over there. Will not each one of you, my dear
   children, pray this prayer? I pray the Holy Spirit to move you to cry,
   "Lord, save little Annie" or, "Lord, save little Mary." And may you
   boys be equally moved to pray, "Lord, save Tom" or, "Lord, save Harry."
   Pray for yourself in just that simple way and who knows what blessing
   may come to you? Then you mothers will surely not let your children
   pray for themselves while you remain prayerless--will not each one of
   you pray, "Lord, save me"? And you working men, whom I am so glad to
   see at a week-night service, do not go away without presenting your own
   personal petitions! The Apostle Peter had to pray for himself. The most
   eminent servants of God had to pray for themselves and you must pray
   for yourselves. If all the saints of God were to pray for you with one
   united voice as long as you live--you would not be saved unless you,
   also, cried to God for yourself! Religion is a personal matter. There
   is no such thing as religion by proxy! You must repent for yourselves
   and pray for yourselves--and believe for yourselves if you would be
   saved! May God grant that you may do so!

   VI. I want you to notice, next, that PETER'S PRAYER WAS A VERY URGENT
   ONE. "Lord, save me."

   He did not say, "Lord, save me tomorrow." Or, "Lord, save me in an
   hour's time." He was "beginning to sink." The hungry waves had opened
   their mouths to swallow him and he would soon be gone! He had only time
   to cry, "Lord, save me," but he no doubt meant, "Lord, save me now, for
   I am in danger of being drowned. Lord, save me now, for if You should
   delay, I shall sink to the bottom of the sea." "And immediately Jesus
   stretched forth His hand and caught him," and so saved him. There are
   many people who would like Jesus to save them, but when? Ah, that is
   the point which they have not settled yet. A young man says, "I should
   like Christ to save me when I grow older, when I have seen a little
   more of life." You mean when you have seen a great deal more of death,
   for that is all you will see in the world--there is no real life except
   that which is in Christ Jesus! Many a man in middle life has said, "I
   mean to be a Christian before I die, but not just yet." He has been too
   busy to seek the Lord, but death has come to him without any warning
   and, busy or not, he has had to die quite unprepared.

   There is hope for a sinner when he prays, "Lord, my case is urgent,
   save me now! Sin, like a viper, has fastened itself upon me, Lord, save
   me now from its deadly venom! I am guilty and already condemned because
   I have not believed in Jesus. Lord, save me now, save me from
   condemnation, save me from the damning sin of unbelief! Lord, I know I
   am now upon the brink of death and I am in danger of Hell as well as of
   death as long as I am unforgiven. Therefore, be pleased to let the
   wheels of Your chariot of Mercy hurry and save me even now O Lord!" I
   have known some who have been so deeply under the influence of the Holy
   Spirit, that they have knelt down by their bedsides and said, "We will
   never give sleep to our eyes, or slumber to our eyelids, till we have
   found the Savior." And before long they have found Him. They have said,
   "We will wrestle in prayer until our burden of sin is gone." And when
   they have reached that determination, it has not been long before they
   have obtained the blessing they desire. When nothing else succeeds,
   importunity will surely prevail! When you will not take a denial from
   God, He will not give you a denial! But as long as you are content to
   be unsaved, you will be unsaved. When you cry with all the urgency of
   which you are capable, "I must have Jesus or die! I am hungering,
   thirsting, pining, panting after Him as the hart pants after the
   water-brooks," it shall not be long before you clasp that priceless
   treasure to your heart and say, "Jesus is my Savior! I have believed in
   Him."

   VII. Now, lastly, I must remind you that PETER'S PRAYER WAS AN
   EFFECTUAL ONE. "Lord, save me," and Jesus did save him.

   There may be comfort to some here present in the thought that although
   this was the prayer of a man in trouble, and a man in whom there was a
   mixture of unbelief and faith, yet it succeeded. Imperfections and
   infirmities shall not prevent prayer from speeding if it is but sincere
   and earnest. Jesus said to Peter, "O you of little faith, why did you
   doubt?" Which shows that he doubted although there was some faith in
   him, for he believed that Christ could save him from a watery grave.
   Many of us, also, are strange mixtures, even as Peter was. Repentance
   and hardness of heart can each occupy a part of our being--and faith
   may be in our heart, together with a measure of unbelief--even as it
   was with the man who said to Jesus, "Lord, I believe--help You my
   unbelief."

   Do any of you feel that you need to pray, and yet cannot pray? You
   would believe in Jesus, but there is another law in your members which
   keeps you back. You would pray an effectual prayer, like that of
   Elijah, never staggering at the promise through unbelief but, somehow
   or other--you cannot tell why--you cannot attain to that prayer. Yet
   you will not give up praying. You feel that you cannot do that. You
   still linger at the Mercy Seat even when you cannot prevail with God in
   prayer. Ah, dear Soul, it is a mercy that God does not judge your
   prayer by what it is in itself--He judges it from another point of view
   altogether! Jesus takes it, mends it, adds to it the merit of His own
   precious blood and then, when He presents it to His Father, it is so
   changed that you would scarcely recognize it as your petition! You
   would say, "I can hardly believe that is my prayer, Christ has so
   greatly altered and improved it." It has happened to you as it
   sometimes happens to poor people who are in trouble--as it didhappen to
   one whom I knew some time ago. A good woman wanted me to send in a
   petition to a certain government office concerning her husband, who was
   dead, and for whose sake she wanted to get some help. She drew up the
   petition and brought it to me. About one word in ten was spelt
   correctly and the whole composition was unfit to send. She wanted me to
   add my name to it and post it for her. I did so, but I first re-wrote
   the whole petition, keeping the subject matter as she put it, but
   altering the form and wording of it. That is what our good Lord and
   Master does for us--only in an infinitely higher sense--He re-writes
   our petition, sets His own signature to it--and when His Father sees
   that, He grants the request at once! One drop of Christ's blood upon a
   prayer must make it prosper!

   Go home, therefore, you who are troubled with doubts and fears, you who
   are vexed by Satan, you who are saddened by the recollection of your
   own past sins--notwithstanding all this--go to God, and say, "Father, I
   have sinned against Heaven, and before You," and ask for His
   forgiveness, and His forgiveness you shall receive! Keep on praying in
   such a fashion as this, "Lord, save me for Jesus' sake! Jesus, You are
   the Savior of sinners. Save me, I beseech You. You are mighty to save.
   Lord, save me! You are in Heaven pleading for transgressors. Lord,
   plead for me!" Do not wait till you get home, but pray just where you
   are sitting, "Lord save me." May God give Grace to everyone here to
   pray that prayer from the heart, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW 6:5-34.

   Verse 5. And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for
   they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the
   streets, that they may be seen of men. We ought to pray in the
   synagogue and we may pray at the corners of the streets--but it is
   wrong to do it to "be seen of men," that is, to be looking for some
   present reward in the praises that fall from human lips.

   5-7. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But you, when you
   pray, enter into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to
   your Father who is in the secret place and your Father who sees in
   secret shall reward you openly. But when you pray, use not vain
   repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard
   for their much speaking. They seem to attribute a sort of power to a
   certain form of words, as if it were a charm--and they repeat it over
   and over again. Not only do the poor Muslims and heathens "use vain
   repetitions," but the members of the Roman Catholic and other churches
   that I might name do the same thing--words to which they attach but
   very slight meaning, and into which they put little or no heart--are
   repeated by them again and again, as if there could be some virtue in
   the words themselves! Let it not be so with you, Beloved. Pray as long
   as you like in secret, but do not pray long with the idea that God will
   hear you simply because you are a long while at your devotions.

   8. Be not you, therefore, like them: for your Father knows what things
   you have need of before you ask Him. He does not need to be informed,
   nor even to be persuaded! Mere words are of no value in His ears. If
   you must use many words, ask men to lend you their ears, for they may
   have little else to do with them. God cares not for words only, it is
   the thought, the desire of the heartto which He always has regard.

   9. After this manner therefore pray you. Here is a model prayer for you
   to copy as far as it is suited to your case--

   9-13. Our Father in Heaven, [See Sermon #312, Volume 4--THE FATHERHOOD
   OF GOD.] Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done in
   earth, as it is in Heaven. [See

   Sermon #1778, Volume 30--A HEAVENLY PATTERN FOR OUR EARTHLY LIFE.]

   Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we
   forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation,

   [See Sermon #1402, Volume 24--"LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION".] but
   deliver us from evil: for Yours is the kingdom and the power, and the
   glory, forever Amen. And then, as if there was one part of the prayer
   that would be sure to arrest the attention of His hearers, namely, that
   concerning forgiving our debtors, the Savior makes the following
   remarks--

   14, 15. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
   will also forgive you: but if you forgive not men their trespasses,
   neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Therefore, in order
   to succeed in prayer, we must have a heart purged from a spirit of
   revenge and from all unkindness! We must, ourselves, be loving and
   forgiving, or we cannot expect that God will hear our supplications
   when we come to crave His forgiveness.

   16. Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
   countenance: for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto
   men to fast.They seemed to say to everyone who looked at them, "We have
   been so engrossed with our devotions that we have not found time even
   to wash our faces." But the Savior says to His followers, "Do not
   imitate those hypocrites! Do not make public your private religious
   exercises--perform them unto God--not unto men. As for those
   hypocrites"--

   16. Verily I say unto you, They have theirreward. And a poor reward it
   is.

   17, 18. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face;
   that you appear not unto men to fast, but unto your Father, which is in
   secret: and your Father, which sees in secret, shall reward you openly.
   May God give us that modest, unselfish spirit which lives unto Him and
   does not want to walk in the sham light of men's esteem! What matters
   it, after all, what men think of us? The hypocrite proudly boasts if he
   wins a little praise from his fellows--but what is it except so much
   wind? If all men should speak well of us, all that we would gain would
   be this, "Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you, for so did
   their fathers to the false prophets."

   19, 20. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
   rust corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for
   yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupt,
   and where thieves do not break through nor steal.Christ here first
   teaches us how to pray, and then teaches us how to really live. He
   turns our thoughts from the objective in life which allures and injures
   so many, but which is, after all, an objective unworthy of our search.
   And He bids us seek something higher and better--"Lay up for yourselves
   treasures in Heaven."

   21. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.It is
   sure to be so--your heart will follow your treasure. Send it away,
   therefore, up to the everlasting hills! Lay up treasure in that blessed
   land before you go there yourself!

   22, 23. The lamp of the body is the eye: if, therefore, your eye is
   good, your whole body shall be full of light. But if your eye is evil,
   your whole body shall be full of darkness. If, therefore, the light
   that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness! [See Sermon
   #335, Volume 6--A SINGLE EYE AND SIMPLE FAITH.] If your eye is brooked
   up with gold dust, or if you are living for self and this world, your
   whole life will be a dark life--and the whole of your being will dwell
   in darkness. "But," says someone, "may I not live for this world and
   the next, too?" Listen--

   24. No man can serve two masters.He may serve two individuals, who have
   conflicting interests but they cannot both be his masters.

   24. For either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he
   will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and
   mammon.Either the one or the other will be master! They are so opposed
   to each other, they will never agree to a divided service. "You cannot
   serve God and mammon." It is the Lord Jesus Christ who says this, so do
   not attempt to do what He declares is impossible!

   25. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life It should
   be, "Take no distracting thought for your

   life"--

   25. What you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body,
   what you shall put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body
   than raiment?You are obliged to leave your life with God. Why not leave
   with Him all care about your food and your raiment?

   26. Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they
   reap, or gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are
   you not much better than they?Do you believe that after all your
   earnest labor and your industry, God will permit you to starve, when
   these creatures, that labor not, are fed?

   27-29. Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature? And
   why do you worry about your raiment? Consider the lilies of the field,
   how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto
   you, That even Solomon in all his glory was never arrayed like one of
   these. Christ asks them whether, by worrying, they can add a single
   cubit to their lives, for I take his question to mean, whether they
   could, by any means, make the standard of existence any

   longer than it was. They could not do so--they could shorten it, and
   very often worrying has brought men to their graves. Then Christ bade
   them note how the lilies grow, so that even Solomon could not excel
   them for beauty!

   30-33. Therefore, if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today
   is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not much more clothe
   you, O you of little faith? Therefore, worry not, saying, What shall we
   eat? Or, What shall we drink? Or, How shall we be clothed? (For after
   all these things do the Gentiles seek) for our heavenly Father knows
   that you have need of all these things. But seek you first the Kingdom
   of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall

   be added unto you.

The Great Pot and the Twenty Loaves

   (No. 3187)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Set on the great pot." 2 Kings 4:38.

   "Then bring meal." 2 Kings 4:41.

   "Give unto the people that they may eat." 2 Kings 4:42.

   WE scarcely need go over the story. There was a shortage of food in the
   land. Elisha came to the college of the Prophets, which consisted of
   about a hundred Brothers and found that they were in need as the result
   of the famine. While he was teaching the young men, he observed that
   they looked as if they needed food and he found that there was none in
   the house. Elisha, therefore, ordered his servant to take the great
   pot, which generally stood upon long legs over the fire, and make a
   nourishing soup in it. True, there was nothing to put in this pot, but
   he believed that God would provide. It was for him to set the pot over
   the fire, and it was for the Lord to fill it! Some of the young men
   were not so sure as Elisha was that God could fill it without their
   help--and one, with great eagerness, went out to gather something from
   the fields. His help turned out to be of small service, for he brought
   home poisonous cucumbers, cut them up and threw them into the broth.
   And, lo, when they began to pour it out, it was acrid to the taste,
   gave them a terrible colic, and made them cry out, "There is death in
   the pot!"

   Then the Prophet said, "Bring meal." This was put into the steaming
   caldron, the poison was neutralized, the food was made wholesome and
   the students were satisfied. This miracle was in due time followed up
   by another. A day or two afterwards, the young Prophets were still
   needing food and the larder was again empty. Just at that time, a
   devout man comes from a little distance, bringing a present for the
   Prophet which consisted of a score of loaves similar to our penny
   rolls. The Prophet bids his servitor set this slender quantity before
   the college. He is astonished at the command to feed a hundred hungry
   men with so little, but he is obedient to it. And while he is obeying,
   the little food is multiplied so that the hundred men eat and are
   perfectly satisfied--and there is some left!

   I believe there are lessons to be learned from these two miracles and I
   shall try to bring out these lessons in three forms. First, as they
   shall relate to the present condition of religion in our land.
   Secondly, as they may be made to relate to the condition of
   backsliders. And thirdly, as they may afford comfortable direction to
   seeking sinners.

   I. First, then, our text, as in a parable, sets forth in a figure our
   course of action in connection with RELIGION IN THIS LAND.

   And first, there is a great need of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We have
   not a hundred men famishing nowadays, but hundreds of thousands--and
   even hundreds of millions in this great world who are perishing for
   lack of heavenly food! The Church must feed the people. It is not for
   us to say, "We hope they will be saved," and leave it there. Or set it
   down as a work that cannot be done till the millennium and, therefore,
   we have nothing to do with it. Our business is in the strength of God
   to grapple with the present condition of things! Here are the millions
   famishing--shall we let them famish? I remember seeing similar
   sentences under the likeness of the late Richard Knill--"The heathen
   are perishing! Shall we let them perish?" "But," says one, "how can we
   possibly supply them with food?" Look what Elisha did--the people were
   hungry and there was no food in hand, except a little meal, yet he
   said, "Set on the great pot."

   Faith always does as much as she can--if she cannot fill the pot, she
   can, at any rate, put it on the fire. If she cannot find meat for the
   pottage, she pours in the water, lights the fire--and prays and waits.
   Some have not this faith, nowadays, and until we have it, we cannot
   expect the blessing! Thus says the Lord, "Enlarge the place of your
   tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitation." Why?
   Because, "you shall break forth on the right hand and on the left." Few
   will regard such a summons as this. The feeble faith of our time finds
   it difficult to enlarge the tent even after the increase has come and
   the people are there to fill it! Great faith would enlarge the tent and
   expect the Lord to keep His promise and multiply us with men as with a
   flock! The Church of God greatly needs not foolish confidence in
   herself, which would lead her to be Quixotic, but simple confidence in
   God which would enable her to be Apostolic, for she would go forth
   believing that God would be with her and great things would be
   accomplished by her! She would open her mouth wide, expecting that God
   would fill it, and fill it He would! Faith does what she can, and waits
   for her Lord to do what He can. Brother, Sister, what is your faith
   doing? Are you putting a great pot on the fire in expectation of a
   blessing?

   "Set on the great pot," said the Prophet, "and boil the pottage." He
   was not in jest. He meant what he said. Often, when we get as far as
   setting on the pot, it is not for boiling pottage! We feel the desire
   to carry out spiritual work, but we do not come to practical action as
   those who work for immediate results. Oh, for practical common sense in
   connection with Christianity! Oh, for reality in connection with the
   idea of faith! When a man goes to his business to make money, he goes
   there with all his wits about him--but frequently when men come to
   prayer and Christian service--they leave their minds behind and do not
   act as if they were transacting real business with God. Elisha, when he
   said, "Set on the great pot," expected God to fill it! He was sure it
   would be so and he waited in all patience till dinner was ready. O
   Church of God, set on the pot, and the great pot, too! Say, "The Lord
   will bless us." Get your granary cleaned out, that the Lord may fill it
   with His good corn! Put the grist into the hopper and look for the wind
   to turn the sails of the mill. O you doubters, throw up the windows
   that the fresh breeze of the Divine Spirit may blow in on your sickly
   faces! Expect that God is about to send the manna and have your omers
   ready! We shall see greater things than these if we awake to our duty
   and our privilege! It is the Church's business to feed the world with
   spiritual bread--she can only do so by faith-- and she ought to act in
   faith in reference to it!

   The faith of Elisha was not shared by all the Brothers. There were some
   who must go and fill the pot, as we have said, but they gathered the
   gourds of the colocynth vine and poisoned the whole mess! And it became
   necessary to find an antidote for the poison. We here see our second
   duty--the Church must provide an antidote for the heresies and
   poisonous doctrines of the time. There has entered into the public
   ministry of this country a deadly poison. We may say of the Church in
   general, "O you man of God, there is death in the pot!" Zealous
   persons, whose zeal for God is not according to knowledge, have gone
   about and gathered the gourds of the wild vine. I think I could tell
   you what kind of gourds they are--some of them are very pretty to look
   at, and they grow best on the seven hills of Rome, they are called
   "Ritualistic performances." These they shred into the pot. There are
   gourds of another kind, very delicate and dainty in appearance, which
   are known as "liberal views" or, "modern thought." As a philosopher
   once talked of extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, so the wild gourds
   are said to consist of "sweetness and light," but the light is darkness
   and the sweetness is deadly! They have shred these into the pot and
   nobody can taste the doctrinal mixture which is served out from some
   pulpits without serious risk of soul-poisoning for, "there is death in
   the pot." What Scriptural doctrine is there which men do not deny and
   yet call themselves Christians? What Truth of God is there which our
   fathers held which is endorsed by those who think themselves the
   leaders of advanced thought? Have they not polluted the entire
   sanctuary of truth and lifted up their axes against all the carved work
   of the Temple? On the other hand, have we not, almost everywhere, put
   aside Christ for the crucifix? And the blessed Spirit thrust into a
   corner by the so-called "sacraments"? Is not the outward made to drown
   the inward, and is not the precious Truth of the Gospel overlaid by the
   lies of Rome?

   There is death in the pot! How is the Church to meet it? I believe it
   is to imitate Elisha. We need not attempt to get the wild gourds out of
   the pot--they are cut too small and are too cunningly mixed up. They
   have entered too closely into the whole mass of teaching to be removed.
   Who shall extract the leaven from the leavened loaf? What then? We must
   look to God for help and use the means indicated here. "Bring meal"
   Good wholesome food was cast into the poisonous stuff and, by God's
   gracious working, it killed the poison. And the Church must cast the
   blessed Gospel of the Grace of God into the poisoned pottage--and then
   false doctrine will not be able to destroy men's souls as it now does.
   We shall

   not do much good by disputing, denouncing and refusing to associate
   with people. I call such things barking, but preaching the Gospel is
   biting. The surest remedy for false doctrine is preaching the Truth of
   God. Christianity is the cure for Popery! Preach up Christ and down go
   the priests! Preach Grace and there is an end of "masses." I am more
   and more persuaded that the good old Calvinistic truths which are now
   kept in the background, are the great Krupp guns with which we shall
   blow to pieces the heresies of the day if once more they are plainly
   and persistently preached in harmony with the rest of revealed Truths
   of God!

   Is the remedy too simple? Do not, therefore, despise it! God be thanked
   that it issimple, for then we shall not be tempted to give the glory to
   man's wit and wisdom when the good result is achieved. In this work you
   can all help, for if only meal is needed, a child may bring his little
   handful. One man may contribute more than another, but the humblest may
   put in his pinch of meal, and even the most common servitor in the
   house may assist in this work. Spread the Gospel! Spread the Gospel!
   Spread the Gospel! A Society for Prosecuting Puseyites, will that do
   the work? Appeals to Parliament, will they be effectual? Let those who
   choose to do so cry to lawyers and Parliaments, but as for us, we will
   preach the Gospel! If I could speak with a voice of thunder, I would
   say to those friends who are for adopting other means to stop the
   spread of error, "You waste your time and strength! Give all your
   efforts to the preaching of the Gospel. Lift up Christ and lay the
   sinner low! Proclaim justification by faith, the work of the Holy
   Spirit in regeneration and the grand old doctrines of the Reformation
   and your work will be done--but by no other means." "Bring meal," said
   the Prophet, and our word at this time is, "Preach the Truth of God as
   it is in Jesus."

   Some of the grossest errors of our own day may yet be overruled by God
   for the promotion of His Truth. There are men who believe in
   Sacramentarianism who love the Lord Jesus very ardently. When I read
   some of the poetry of this school, I cannot but rejoice to see that the
   writers love my Lord and Master--and it strikes me that if the whole
   Gospel could be put before them, we might expect to see some of them
   become noble preachers of the Truth of God and, perhaps, save the
   orthodox from dead dry doctrinalism by reviving a more direct devotion
   to the Savior. Perhaps they will not, with us, talk often of
   justification by faith, but if they extol the merit of the precious
   blood and wounds of Jesus, it will come to much the same thing. For my
   part, I care little for the phraseology, if essential Truths of God are
   really taught and the Lord Jesus is exalted!

   Some of the doubters, too--"thinkers"--as they prefer to be called, if
   our Lord renewed them by His Spirit, might bring out the old Truths
   with greater freshness than our more conservative minds are able to do.
   I love to hear those who have known the vanity of error speak out the
   Truth! They are more sympathetic towards the tempted and are generally
   more conversant with the grounds of our faith.

   Who knows? Who knows? I have a hope which may not prove a dream. I hope
   that thousands are feeling their way into the Light of God and will
   come forth soon. Let us not despair, but keep to our work which is
   Gospel preaching, telling about Jesus and His dear love, the power of
   His blood, the prevalence of His plea and the Glory of His Throne and
   who knows but that a multitude of the priests may believe, and the
   philosophers, also, may become babes in Christ's school? "Bring meal,"
   and thus meet the poison with the antidote!

   Another lesson comes from the second miracle. Let us look at it. The
   loaves brought to Elisha were not quartern loaves like ours, but either
   mere wafers of meal which had been laid flat on a hot stone and so
   baked, or else small rolls of bread. That store was but little, yet
   Elisha said, "Feed the people," and they were fed. That is the third
   lesson, the Church is to use all she has and trust in God to multiply
   her strength. Nowadays, individuals are apt to think they may leave
   matters to Societies, but this is highly injurious. We should,
   everyone, go forth to work for God and use our own talents, be they few
   or many. Societies are not meant to enable us to shirk our personal
   duty under the idea that our strength is small. Little Churches are apt
   to think that they cannot do much and, therefore, they do not expect a
   great blessing. What can these few cakes do towards feeding a hundred
   men? They forget that God can multiply them! Do you limit the Holy One
   of Israel? Do you think He needs our numbers? Do you think He is
   dependent upon human strength? I tell you, our weakness is a better
   weapon for God than our strength! The Church in the Apostolic times was
   poor and mostly made up of unlearned and ignorant men--but she was
   filled with power. What name that would have been famous in ordinary
   history do you find among her first members? Yet that humble Church of
   fishermen and common people shook the world! The Church nowadays is,
   for the most part, too strong, too wise, too self-dependent to do much.
   Oh, that she were more God-reliant! Even those whom you call great
   preachers will be great evils if you trust to them! This I know--we
   ought never to complain of weakness, or poverty, or lack of
   prestige--but should consecrate to God what we have.

   "Oh, but I can scarcely read a chapter!" Well, read that chapter to
   God's Glory! You who cannot say more than half-a-dozen words to others?
   Say that little in the power of the Spirit! If you cannot do more than
   write a letter to a friend about his soul, or give away a tract to a
   stranger in the streets, do it in God's name! Brother, Sister, do what
   you can and in doing this, God will strangely multiply your power to do
   good and cause great results to flow from small beginnings. Active
   faith is needed--and if this is richly present, the Lord in whom we
   trust will do for us exceeding abundantly above all that we ask, or
   even think!

   II. And now, briefly, but very earnestly, I desire to speak TO
   BACKSLIDERS.

   In all our Churches there are members who are no better than they
   should be. It is very questionable whether they ought to be allowed to
   be members at all--they have gone very far back from what they used to
   be, or ought to be. They scarcely ever join the people of God in public
   prayer, though they once professed to be very devout. Private prayer is
   neglected and family prayer given up. Is it not so with some to whom I
   address myself? Have you not lost the Light of God's Countenance and
   gone far away from happy communion with Christ? It is not for me to
   charge you--let your own consciences speak! I hope that you are now
   beginning to feel an inward hunger and to perceive that your
   backslidings have brought famine to you. What shall I bid you do? Go
   and attempt your own restoration by the works of the Law? By no
   means--I bid you bring your emptiness to Christ and look for His
   fullness. Yours is a great empty pot--set it on the fire and cry to God
   to fill it! Jesus says to lukewarm Laodicea, "If any man hears My
   voice, and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with
   him." "Alas," says the Laodicean, "I have nothing in the house!" Your
   confession is true, but when our Lord comes to sup, He brings His
   supper with Him! He stands at the door of every backslider and knocks.
   Will you let Him in? "Oh," you say, "I wish He would enter." Dear
   Brothers and Sisters, open your heart, now, just as you did at the
   first when, as a poor sinner you went to Him. Say to him, "Blessed
   Lord, there is nothing in me but emptiness, but here is the guest
   chamber. Come in all Your love and sup with me, and let me sup with
   You. I am nothing, come and be my All-in-All." "But," says the
   backslider "may I really come to Jesus, just as I did at the first?"
   Listen! "Return, you backsliding children, for I am married unto you,
   says the Lord." He is married to you! And though you have behaved
   badly, the marriage bond is not broken. Where is the bill of
   divorcement which He has sued you? Is it not written ,"He hates putting
   away"? Come just as you are and begin anew--for He will accept you
   again.

   "But," you say, "alas for me, I have been gathering wild gourds!" What
   have you been doing, professor? You have left undone what you ought to
   have done and you have done many things you ought not to have done and,
   therefore, there is no health in you. You have been trying to find
   pleasure in the world and you have found wild vines. You have been
   tempted by love of music, love of mirth, love of show--and you have
   gathered wild gourds, a lap full, almost a heart full! You have been
   shredding death into the pot and now you cannot feel as you used to
   feel--the poison is stupefying your soul. While we were singing, just
   now, you said, "I want to sing as saints do, but there is no praise in
   me." When you meet with a man who is mighty in prayer, you say, "Alas,
   I used to pray like that, but my power is gone." The poison is
   paralyzing you! If you are a worldling, and not God's child, you can
   live on that which would poison a Christian, but if you are a child of
   God, you will cry out, "O you man of God, there is death in the pot!"
   Some of you have become rich and have fallen into worldly fashionable
   habits--these are the colocynth cucumbers. Others of you are poor and
   necessarily work with ungodly men and, perhaps, their example has
   lowered the tone of your spirit and led you into their ways. If you
   love this condition, I grieve for you--but if you loathe it, I trust
   you are a child of God, notwithstanding your state.

   What are you to do who have in any way fallen? Why, receive afresh the
   soul-saving Gospel! "Bring meal"--simple, nourishing, Gospel Truth--and
   cast it into the poisoned pottage! Begin anew with Jesus Christ, as you
   did at first! Say to Him, "God be merciful to me a sinner." "Repent and
   do your first works." Do you not recollect the period when first your
   eyes lighted on His Cross and you stood there burdened and heavy-laden,
   fearing that you would sink to Hell until you read in His dear wounds
   that your sins were put away? There you found peace as you saw your
   transgressions laid on Jesus and removed from you. Oh, how you loved
   Him! Come, Brother, come, Sister, let us go tonight again to the Cross
   and begin to love Him again. That will cure you of the world's personal
   influences and bring back the old feelings, the old joys, the old
   loves--and take the death out of the pot! Backslider, you see now
   exactly what you needed at first,

   namely, faith in Jesus. Come repenting, come believing in the Savior
   and He will remove the ills which the gourds of earth's wild vines have
   brought upon you!

   "Ah," say some of you, "we can understand how the Lord Jesus can fill
   our emptiness and heal our soul's sicknesses, but how shall we continue
   in the right way? Our past experience has taught us our weakness--we
   are afraid that even the great pot will only last us for a little while
   and then our souls will famish." Then remember the other part of our
   text, in which we read that when the few loaves, and the ears of corn
   in the husks, were brought to Elisha, the Lord multiplied them. Though
   you may have very little Grace, that Grace shall be increased. "He
   gives more Grace." We receive Grace for Grace, daily Grace for daily
   need! Between this and Heaven you will need a Heaven full of Grace and
   you will have it! No one knows what drafts you will make upon the
   sacred bank of the King of kings, but His treasury will not be
   exhausted! "Trust in the Lord and do good--so shall you dwell in the
   land, and verily you shall be fed."

   III. Our third and last word is TO THE SEEKING SINNER.

   Many of you, I trust, desire salvation. The subject before us has much
   comfort in it for you. You are hungering and thirsting after Christ,
   but have not yet found peace in Him. You lament your own emptiness of
   all that is good. Then, poor Soul, do just what the Prophet bade his
   servant do, "set on the great pot," that is, confess your emptiness
   unto the Lord! Tell the Lord what a sinner you are. I know not whether
   the story is true of Mr. Rowland Hill's leading the landlord of an inn
   to pray. Mr. Hill would have family prayer wherever he stayed--and if
   this was refused, he would order out his horses and go on. On one
   occasion, he is reported to have asked the landlord to act as priest in
   his own house, but the man replied, "I can't pray, I never prayed in my
   life." However, after a while, Mr. Hill had him on his knees and when
   the man said, "I cannot pray," Mr. Hill cried out, "Tell the Lord so
   and ask Him to help you." The man exclaimed, "O God, I can't pray,
   teach me!" "That will do," said Mr. Hill, "you have begun." Whatever
   your state is, tonight, if you desire salvation, go and tell the Lord
   your condition! Say, "Lord, I have a hard heart--soften it." If you
   cannot feel, tell Him so and ask Him to make you feel. Begin at the
   root of the matter--set on the great pot, empty as it is. Be honest
   with the Most High. Reveal to Him what He knows so well, but what you
   know so little--the evil of your heart and your great necessity. If you
   cannot come with a broken heart, come for a broken heart! If you cannot
   come with anything good, the mercy is that nothing good is needed as a
   preparation for coming to Christ. Come just as you are! Do not wait to
   fill the pot, but set it on to be filled.

   Do I hear you reply, "Ah, you don't know who I am. I have lived many
   years in sin"? Yes, I know you. You are the young man that found the
   wild vine and went and gathered of its gourds a lapful--a horrible
   lapful. Some of you rebellious sinners have ruined yourselves, body and
   soul, and perhaps in estate as well, by your sins. We hear of people
   sowing their wild oats--that is a bad business. They had better never
   do it, for the reaping of those wild oats is terrible work! You have
   poisoned your life, man, with those wild gourds. Can the pottage of
   your life be made wholesome again? Yes! You cannot do it with your own
   efforts, but, "bring meal," and it will be done. If you believe on the
   Lord Jesus, He will be the antidote to deadly habits of sin! If you
   will simply trust in Him who bled for you, the tendency of your soul to
   sin shall be overcome, the poison which now boils in your veins shall
   be expelled, and your soul shall escape as a bird out of the snare of
   the fowler! Your flesh upon you, in a spiritual sense, shall become
   fresher than a little child's. Though you are full of the poison till
   every vein is ready to burst with it, the Great Physician will give you
   an antidote which shall at once and forever meet your case! Will you
   not try it? Incline your ear and come unto Him--hear, and your soul
   shall live! May God put the meal of the Gospel into the pot tonight!

   "Ah," you say, "but if I were now pardoned, how should I hold on? I
   have made a hundred promises and always broken them. I have resolved
   scores of times, but my resolutions have never come to anything." Ah,
   poor Heart, that is when you have the saving of yourself, but when God
   has the saving of you, it will be another matter! When we begin to save
   ourselves, we very soon come to a disastrous shipwreck! But when God,
   the eternal Lover of the souls of men, puts His hand to salvation-work
   and Jesus puts forth the hand once fastened to the Cross, there are no
   failures!

   I have tried to preach a very simple sermon and to say some earnest
   things. But it is likely that I may have missed the mark with some and,
   therefore, I will again draw the Gospel bow in the name of the Lord
   Jesus. O Lord, direct the arrow! If God will bring souls to Jesus, I
   will bless His name throughout eternity! Poor lost Souls, do you know
   the way of salvation, do you know how simple it is? Do you know the
   love of God to such poor souls as you are and yet do you refuse to
   attend to it? Do you know that He does not exact any hard conditions of
   you, but He points to His Son on the Cross and says, "Look"? Can it be
   that you will not look? Does Jesus die to save, and do you think it is
   not worth your while to think about salvation? What is the matter with
   you? Surely you must be mad! When I look back on my own neglect of
   Christ till I was 15 years old, it seems like a delirious dream! And
   when I think of some of you who are 30 or 40 and yet have never thought
   about your souls, what can be invented to excuse you? I see some of you
   with bald heads, or with the snow of wintry age lying upon them and you
   have not yet considered the world to come. I would say to you, "Men,
   are you mad?" Why, you are worse than mad, for if you were insane, you
   could be excused! Alas, the madness of sin has responsibility connected
   with it and, therefore, it is the worst of all insanities! I pray you,
   by the living God, you unsaved ones, turn unto the Savior tonight!
   Whether you are saved or lost cannot so much matter to me as it will to
   you. If I faithfully beseech you to look to Jesus, I shall be clear,
   even if you reject the warning. But for your own sakes, I beseech you
   to turn to Jesus! By death, which may be so near to you. By judgment,
   which is certain to you all. By the terrors of Hell, by the
   thunderbolts of execution, by eternity and, better still, by the sweets
   of Jesus' love, by the charms of His matchless beauty, by the Grace
   which He is prepared to give, by the Heaven whose gates of pearl are
   glistening before the eyes of faith, by the sea of glass unruffled by a
   single wave of trouble--where you shall stand forever blest if you
   believe in Jesus--by the Lord Himself, I entreat you, seek Him at once,
   while He may be found! May His Holy Spirit lead you to do so! Amen and
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 KINGS4:1-37.

   Verse 1. Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of
   the Prophets unto Elisha, saying, Your servant, my husband, is dead;
   and you know that your servant did fear the LORD. And the creditor is
   come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. According to the very
   cruel custom of those times, if a man were in debt and had no means of
   payment, his children were sold for slaves. Here was a poor widow whose
   husband had been one of the sons of the Prophets, but he had died in
   debt. He was evidently one who was known to Elisha as a faithful,
   God-fearing man and, perhaps that partly accounted for his poverty. The
   false priests were fed at Jezebel's table, but because this man
   worshipped Jehovah, the one living and true God, he had probably been
   persecuted and hunted down until he had lost what little he formerly
   had and, therefore, when he died, he could leave his wife no other
   legacy than that of debt. And in consequence, the creditor came to
   seize her two sons to be bondmen.

   2. And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for you? Tell me, what
   have you in the house? And she said, Your handmaid has not anything in
   the house, save a pot of oil They used oil extensively in the
   preparation of their food as well as for lighting their dwellings. This
   woman was so poor that she had no meal in the house, but she had a
   little oil. When our Lord was about to feed the five thousand, He asked
   His disciples, "How many loaves have you?" So here the Prophet asked
   the poor woman, "What have you in the house?" and she told him she had
   only "a pot of oil."

   3. Then he said, Go, borrow the vessels abroad of all your neighbors,
   even empty vessels; borrow not a few. [See Sermon

   #2063, Volume 35--THE FILLING OF EMPTY VESSELS.] Evidently the poor

   woman's credit was good, though her debts were heavy. Her neighbors
   knew she would have paid her creditor if she could, so they were
   willing to grant her request though they probably wondered why she
   wanted so many empty vessels.

   4-7. And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and
   your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set
   aside that which is full. So she went from him and shut the door behind
   her and her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out
   And it came to pass when the vessels were full, that she said unto her
   son, Bring me yet a vessel. Andhe said unto her, There is not a
   vesselmore. And the oil ceased Then she came and told the man of God.
   As

   it was through obeying his directions she had miraculously obtained
   this large supply of oil, she would not make use of it

   without further counsel from the man of God who had already given her
   such good advice.

   7. Andhe said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt "That is your first
   duty--'pay your debt'"--

   7, 8. Andlive, you andyour children, on the rest. Now it happened one
   day that Elisha went to Shunem, where was

   a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was,
   that as oft as he passed by, he turned in there to eat

   bread.The Prophet had helped a poor woman. Now a rich woman helps him.
   God sometimes pays His servants in kind

   very speedily for anything they have done for those who belong to Him.
   At other times, He puts it to the credit of their account.

   9-13. And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this
   is an holy Man of God, which passes by continually. Let us make a
   little chamber, I pray you, on the wall; and let us set for him there a
   bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it will be that
   whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there. And it happened one day
   that he came there andhe said to Gehazi, his servant, Call this
   Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him. Andhe
   said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, You have been careful for us
   with all this care. What can I do for you?Do you want me to speak on
   your behalf to the king or to the captain of the army?God's servants
   must not be ungrateful for any kindness that is shown to them. If they
   receive hospitality, they must be ready to give a return of such things
   as they have. Elisha was willing to do anything in his power for this
   hospitable Shunammite, so he said to her, "Do you want me to speak on
   your behalf to the king, or to the captain of the army?"

   13. And she answered, I dwell among my own people. She had no desire
   for earthly greatness and she was very wise, for, usually, happiness is
   to be found in that middle state which Agur desired when he said, "Give
   me neither poverty nor riches." This Shunammite had no wish to be moved
   to the trying and perilous atmosphere of the court or the army--so she
   answered, "I dwell among my own people."

   14-19. Andhe said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
   answered, Verily she has no child and her husband is old. And he said,
   Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door. And he
   said, About this season, according to the time of life, you shall
   embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to
   your handmaiden. And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season
   that Elisha had said unto her according to the time of life. And the
   childgrew, and one day he went out to his father to the reapers. Andhe
   said unto his father, My head, myhead/The sun had been too hot for the
   child. Sunstroke had seized him.

   19, 20. Andhe said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. And when he had
   taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon
   and then died.How transient are all our earthly treasures! The child
   was well, and ill and dead in the course of a few hours! Hold with a
   loose hand all things earthly! Make not your gourds into gods, for they
   will soon wither and die. Very often we destroy our own comforts by
   thinking too much of them. As soon as we make anything that we have
   into an idol, it will be broken in pieces, or taken from us, or in some
   way turned into a curse to us! See how this good woman acted when she
   had suffered this great sorrow.

   21, 22. And she went up and laid him on the bed of the Man of God, and
   shut the door upon him, and went out. And she called unto her husband,
   and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the young men, and one of the
   donkeys, that I may run to the Man of God, and come again. She did not
   tell him her errand. She wished to keep the trouble to herself for a
   while.

   23. Andhe said, Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon,
   nor Sabbath. "It is not the ordinary time for going to the Prophet."

   23. And she said, (Salem, that is, Peace, as we read it), It shall be
   well She must have been a woman of great faith. She checked her natural
   emotions and believed in God that all would be for the best. "It shall
   be well."

   24-26. Then she saddled a donkey and said to her servant, Drive, and go
   forward; slack not your riding for me, except I bid you. So she went
   and came unto the Man of God at mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when
   the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi, his servant,
   Behold, yonder is that Shunammite: run now, I pray you, to meet her,
   and say unto her, Is it well with you, is it well with your husband? Is
   it well with the child? And she answered, It is well. It is heroic
   faith when we can feel that if the child shall die, it is well. If this
   husband shall die, it is well. And if we ourselves shall die, all is
   well, for He who has the arranging of all that concerns us cannot
   arrange otherwise than well! Alas, that often our rebellious spirit
   says, with poor old Jacob, "All these things are against me," but true
   faith sits humbly down at the feet of the great Disposer of all events
   and says, "He has done all things well."

   27. And when she came to the Man of God at the hill, she caught him by
   the feet. As if she feared lest he should go away before she had poured
   into his ears the story of her grief.

   27. But Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said,
   Let her alone, for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD has hid
   it from me, and has not told me. Those ancient Prophets of God had only
   limited knowledge.

   The Spirit of God taught them some things, but not all things, so
   Elisha was made to feel that he was but man, even though the Spirit of
   God often spoke through him.

   28. Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, Do not
   deceive me?Then he learned what her trouble was, and understood that
   the child was dead. Before she had said as much as that, he read the
   news in the tones of her voice.

   29, 30. Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff
   in your hand, and go your way; if you meet any man, salute him not; and
   if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face
   of the child. And the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives, and
   as your soul lives, I will not leave you. She did not believe in
   Gehazi, nor yet in the staff, and herein she was a wise woman. God
   would not bless the Prophet's staff to the child's restoration, lest
   relic worship should spring up among the Israelites, or lest they
   should begin to attach some value to outward signs!

   30-34. And he arose, and followed her. And Gehazi passed on before them
   and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither
   voice, nor hearing. Therefore he went again to meet him, and told him,
   saying, The child is not awaked. And when Elisha was come into the
   house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. He went in,
   therefore, and shut the door upon them and prayed unto the LORD. And he
   went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and
   his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched
   himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. See the
   power of prayer? The very gates of death are made to open when Elisha,
   a man of like passions with ourselves, bows before the Lord in prayer!
   Learn a lesson also from Elisha's attitude toward the dead child, for
   often God is pleased to give spiritual life through the power of human
   sympathy. When we put ourselves into the condition of the sinner--hope
   for him, pray for him, agonize for him in broken-hearted sympathy on
   his account, putting ourselves as far as we can into his place--God
   often makes us the instruments by which His Spirit quickens the dead in
   sin!

   30-37. Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro and went
   up, and stretched himself upon him: and the

   child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. And he called
   Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she
   was come in unto him, he said, Take up your son. Then she went in, and
   fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son,
   and went out Her heart was too full for speech just then, so she took
   up her son and went out.

Discipline in Christ's Army

   (No. 3188)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 10, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   13, 1879.

   "Pass through the host, and command the people." Joshua 1:11.

   [When the "Army Discipline and Regulation Bill" was before the House of
   Commons, Mr. Spurgeon delivered this discourse upon it. Shortly
   afterwards, he published a summary of the sermon in The Sword and the
   Trowel, with a prefatory note in which he said, "We hope to print the
   whole discourse for the use of soldiers." With this view, he had
   commenced to revise it, but had not completed it, and it is now
   published for the first time. Workers among soldiers will find the
   sermon specially suitable for them.]

   BELIEVERS are called to be good soldiers of Jesus Christ. As many of us
   as believe in Him and have obtained eternal life through Him, are now
   enlisted beneath His banner to fight the battles of holiness against
   sin and of truth against error. We war not, however, with flesh and
   blood, but with spiritual enemies. We slay lust and lying, drunkenness
   and blasphemy--and we wage a never-ending warfare against everything
   which is dishonest, unkind, selfish, or ungodly. He who died upon the
   Cross out of love to the undeserving has taught us how to endure
   hardness for His sake as good soldiers of Jesus Christ. Our ambition is
   to fight a good fight and keep the faith. And by the power of the Holy
   Spirit we hope to do so and to receive from our Great Commander's mouth
   the blessed commendation, "Well done, good and faithful servant."

   Being soldiers, we come under discipline, and it is well for all who
   are about to enlist to know what the discipline is, for our glorious
   Captain, the Lord Jesus Christ, says to all who wish to join this army,
   "Count the cost." We, too, would say to all who propose to be soldiers
   of the Cross and followers of the Lamb--"Count the cost." Do not join
   the ranks blindly and then change your mind and desert. Enlist with
   your eyes open and stay in the service till you are veterans. There's
   nothing like knowing what you are doing--and choosing Christ's service
   deliberately. It is to that end that I shall speak upon the discipline
   of Christ's army, for perhaps some who are in the army of Christ in
   name, but not in truth, may find out their mistake and endeavor, by
   sincere repentance, to make sure work of the matter so that they may
   not be deceived. It will be an awful thing to be found out to be a
   hypocrite and to be drummed out of the Lord's army at the last.

   I have here a copy of the "Army Discipline and Regulation Bill" sent to
   me by a member of the House of Commons, with this written in the corner
   of it, "May not the Christian soldier derive some profit from this?" I
   feel sure he may. May the Holy Spirit enable us to do so!

   This Bill contains a list of offenses for which a soldier on active
   service is liable to death--and those offenses are excellent figures of
   certain spiritual offenses which must not be committed by the soldiers
   of Christ! If they fall into them, and continue in them, it will prove
   that they are already under sentence of death and are not Christ's
   servants at all. If any complain that the discipline of our Lord Jesus
   is strict, it will be of benefit to them to see how severe is the
   discipline of every army. Nothing can make Christ's service sweet
   except love to Him--His service appears hardest to those who have hard
   hearts--and just as men grow right and true, they find the Lord's yoke
   to be easy and His burden light. Judging Christianity from the outside,
   it will always seem to unregenerate men a very strict Puritanical
   system. But judging it from the inside, when the heart is renewed and
   the soul is charmed with the blessed Person of their Divine Redeemer,
   we love our Lord's service and find intense delight in it. We consent
   to His Law, that it is good, and we long with all our hearts to keep
   His statutes even to the end. We are glad to know what offenses are,
   that we may pray to be kept from them for we would not willingly offend
   so good a Lord.

   In this Bill, we read that "A Person subject to Military Law, when on
   Active Service, is punishable with Death, if he commits any of the
   following offences"--

   (1) . "Shamefully abandons or delivers up any garrison, place, post, or
   guard, or uses any means to compel or induce any governor, commanding
   officer, or other person, to shamefully abandon or deliver up any
   garrison, place, post, or guard, which was the duty of such governor,
   officer, or person to defend."

   This is a grievous offense in the Church of God and I am sorry to say
   that it has often been committed. We are put in trust with the Gospel
   of Jesus Christ--that is the citadel which we are to defend at all
   hazards--so what a sad thing it is when professed Christ's ministers
   give up Truth of God after Truth in order to please the public! "Tell
   it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon," that
   professed servants of Christ have betrayed the Gospel itself to the
   enemy! O you who follow the banner of Jesus, never do this! Defend it
   with your lives! Die in the defense of it, as the martyrs did, and
   never be ashamed of it in any company. You may not be an officer and,
   therefore, you cannot give up a garrison or castle to the enemy--but
   you have your own post to guard--take care that you guard it! Never
   give up the Bible--no, not a leaf of it! Never give up prayer--stand
   sentry there and let no man laugh you out of it! Whatever post the Lord
   Jesus commits to you, take care that you hold it till He comes, or till
   you, yourself, are called Home to the heavenly headquarters. Hold fast,
   as with a grip of steel, every Doctrine which the Lord has taught you
   whether others approve of it or not! Hold fast, also, and endeavor, by
   the aid of God's Spirit, to put into practice every precept of the
   Lord. Value the practical part of Christianity as well as the
   doctrinal--and prize them both beyond gold. Be not of the mind of those
   who say of Christ's rules, "These are of little consequence." No! Your
   Master's command cannot be a trifle! And the spirit which thinks little
   of anything which Jesus commands is an evil spirit! We must pray
   against it and strive against it. Make it a matter of conscience to
   follow Jesus at all hazards wherever He goes. Stand up for the
   Scriptures and the true Gospel--and "contend earnestly for the faith
   once delivered to the saints." Do not give up a hair of the head of the
   Truth of God, nor let her enemies take away so much as a lace of her
   shoes.

   I believe in the invincibility of truth. Only give truth time and God,
   being with her, she must prevail. I believe also in the invincibility
   of the Church which is built upon the Rock, Christ Jesus, and against
   which the gates of Hell shall never prevail. I am quite willing to be
   in a minority upon a great many questions. I would not believe any more
   than I do even if everybody else believed it--and I would not be any
   the less confident of its truthfulness if it was accepted by only a
   hundredth or a thousandth part of those who now believe it! Get hold of
   a Truth of God, my dear Brother or Sister, and you have laid hold of
   that in which God dwells! Know your Bible thoroughly and believe what
   the Bible reveals. And then, if there are arrayed against Biblical
   Truth--all the powers of Christendom, all the kings and princes and
   prelates and priests joined together--you may rest assured that they
   will only be as so much chaff driven before the wind! If they believe
   error, and advocate error, all their pomp and power will be but as the
   wind, the earthquake and the fire in which God was not! But in your
   calm, quiet adherence to the Truth of God--with a tenacity that would
   brave even martyrdom rather than renounce what God has revealed to you
   in His Word and by his Spirit, there is a power that must win in the
   long run--so hold to it and be not afraid!

   (2) . "Shamefully casts away his arms, ammunition, or tools in the
   presence of the enemy."

   This is a terrible crime, indeed, in a Christian soldier. "Cast not
   away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward."
   Never let go your shield of faith! Under ridicule and persecution,
   buckle it to your arm. Grip firmly that blessed sword of the Spirit,
   which is the Word of God! Let no man take from you a single text of it!
   Speak up for the blessed Truth of God and stand to your gun--this will
   gall the enemy and protect yourself. Rally to the colors and wrap them
   around your heart when they seem to be in peril--I mean, the blood-red
   colors of the Cross of Christ!

   Dear young Brothers and Sisters who love the Lord, I know you have a
   hard fight of it when you get among your friends who are so mean as to
   ridicule you. But never say, "Die"--never give up your faith, never
   yield to their sins, nor give them countenance by so much as joining in
   their laughter! Do not be misled by false teachers, but obey the Word
   of God and follow that alone. Read it for yourselves and what you see
   there lay hold upon, and let it be your religion. I have often said to
   myself--

   "Shouldall the forms that men devise Assault my faith with treacherous
   art, I'd call them vanity and lies, And bind the Gospel to my heart."

   Let us, dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, still hold without
   wavering to our confidence in the Gospel as God's great battle-axe and
   weapon of war! Let us be fully persuaded that this is the chosen
   instrument by which the Lord will glorify Himself and subdue the
   nations of the earth. We may take it for granted that God's
   Providential dispensations will always tend in that direction and that
   the ponderous wheels full of eyes are always revolving in such a way as
   to work out the eternal purposes of Grace in the salvation of those
   whom Christ has redeemed. But, for all that, thepower which God mostly
   blesses is the energy of the Holy Spirit exerted through the preaching
   of the Gospel of Christ--not by kings and princes, or learned doctors
   or eloquent men--but through the Gospel as preached by humble and
   earnest Believers, illustrated by gracious and holy lives, and
   supported by fervent and unceasing prayers! So, Beloved, have faith in
   the Gospel! Do not put your confidence in anything that is not
   authorized by the New Testament. Do not be so foolish as to use any
   means which are not in accordance with God's Word. And do not enter
   into any alliance with the world under the delusion that you will, by
   so doing, help the Gospel! Be satisfied that God is in the still small
   voice and, as He is there, give good heed to the message that He
   utters--and gad not about to seek any other ground of confidence, but
   be content with, "Thus says the Lord."

   (3) . "Treacherously holds correspondence with or gives intelligence to
   the enemy, or treacherously or through cowardice sends a flag of truce
   to the enemy."

   This is another thing that Christian soldiers must never do. Their
   orders are clear--"Come out from among them and be you separate, says
   the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing." This battle of ours against
   sin admits of no truce whatever--no terms of compromise--no going a
   certain way with sinners in the hope of inducing them to come a little
   way with us! No, there must be nothing of the kind. Let the word,
   "compromise," with regard to evil never even cross your thoughts! Our
   Lord and Master made no compromises. He told us that it would be better
   to pluck out our right eye and cut off our right hand rather than that
   they should cause us to offend. Give your heart so fully up to Jesus,
   my Beloved Brothers and Sisters, that you are altogether separated from
   this world! Let the world know whereyou are, what you are and take care
   that youknow where it is and what it is! Be not, I pray you, conformed
   to this world! And, on the other hand, never hide your religion. Do not
   ask for a truce with the enemy, for that would be treachery to your
   Lord. Remember that solemn warning, "Whoever will be a friend of the
   world is the enemy of God." That is no saying of mine--it is one of the
   faithful and true declarations of this Inspired Book!

   I must not stay to say more about this matter, though it is a most
   suggestive point.

   (4) . "Assists the enemy with arms, ammunition, or supplies, or
   knowingly harbors or protects an enemy not being a prisoner "

   Now, every professor who leads an inconsistent life furnishes Christ's
   enemies with "arms, ammunition, or supplies," for they say, "Ah, that
   is one of your Christians!" They fire that as a most deadly shot
   against us. They point to the ways of inconsistent professors and they
   turn to us and say, "That is what you Christians are!" If they take one
   bad sovereign, they never think of saying that all the sovereigns in
   circulation are counterfeit--yet they might as well say that as declare
   that because here and there a professor is a hypocrite or inconsistent,
   therefore, we are all so! That is not true, yet it gives the enemy
   encouragement and supplies him with ammunition when any of you who
   profess to be Christ's, walk as you ought not to walk!

   And then, dear Friends, if we conceal any sin within our bosoms, this
   is knowingly harboring an enemy. If you who are supposed to be
   Christian people drink too much in secret--and there are some, not only
   men, but women, who make a profession of Christianity, who sin in this
   way. And we must speak very plainly when this evil becomes as common as
   it is--you are knowingly harboring an enemy! If, in your trade, you
   follow unrighteous customs--and there are plenty of tradesmen who do
   that--and if you adopt their schemes though you profess to be a servant
   of the Lord Jesus Christ, you are knowingly harboring His enemy--and
   you are not worthy to be called a good soldier of Jesus Christ!

   The enemy will get in if he can, but we must do all we can and also cry
   to God to keep him out. You know that on a cold winter's day, a man
   shuts the door, lights a fire, draws the curtains and insulates the
   door, yet even then the cold gets in. So is it with sin--you may watch
   and guard against it as much as you like but, still, the cold will get
   in--but it is a very different kind of cold from that which would come
   in if you were to open the windows and doors and let it in. That is
   what some do concerning sin. They keep no watch, no guard against it.
   They tempt the devil to tempt them--and those who do this and thus
   knowingly harbor the enemy are no true soldiers of Jesus Christ.

   (5) . "Having been made aprisoner ofwar, voluntarily serves with or
   voluntarily aids the enemy. " Now young men, especially--you who are
   members of this Church or some other Church--there are times when you

   get into a great fix. There are all round you persons who are opposed
   to true religion--and they begin by inviting you to do this, and that,
   and the other, and then they try to compel you to do as they wish. They
   make you, as it were, a prisoner of war, and they say, "You shall do
   such-and-such and such-and-such or we will make you do it." Or possibly
   they suppose that if they use enough ridicule, or enough taunts and
   jeers, they will get the mastery over you. Now is your time to play the
   man! You are taken, as it were, a prisoner of war, but do not forfeit
   your honor by voluntarily serving with or aiding the enemy! They want a
   song from you, do they? Well then, sing them one of the songs about
   Jesus and they will soon want you to stop! But do not yield to their
   desire by singing the song of the worldling, even if you know one. If
   you are Christ's true soldier, you will be most faithful in the hour of
   the greatest trial. But you will need to cry to the Strong for strength
   and ask God to give you sufficient Grace for every time of need.

   Christian tradesmen are sometimes taken prisoners of war in this sense.
   They get into financial difficulties and then it is suggested to them
   by Satan, "You must do such-and-such--you cannot help doing it. Of
   course you would rather not do it, but, under the circumstances, you
   cannot help yourself!" Do not do wrong, my Brother, whatever the
   circumstances may be! Become a bankrupt, lose all that you have and go
   to the workhouse rather than do the least wrong! It would be better to
   die in a ditch than to live and be rich with a guilty conscience! As
   you love your Lord, I beseech you, by that precious blood of His that
   has redeemed you from all iniquity, do not "crucify the Son of God
   afresh, and put Him to an open shame," but stand fast! And having done
   all, still stand. God help any of you who are thus taken prisoners of
   war to avoid doing anything willingly against your Prince and thus
   aiding His enemy!

   (6) . "Knowingly does, when on active service, any act calculated to
   imperil the success of Her Majesty's forces or any part thereof."

   That is rather a strong clause because it takes a very wide sweep. But,
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, we must not knowingly do anything
   calculated to imperil the success of our Master's cause. Will you try
   to think what a comprehensive clause this is? It may be that what you
   do will not actually imperil the success of Christ's cause. You may be
   too insignificant for your act to have any very great result, but
   still, if it is even calculated to have that effect, it is forbidden by
   the articles of war of Prince Emmanuel!

   I will tell you of some things that I think are calculated to imperil
   the success of our Master's cause. There are some of you who have never
   been baptized and who are not members of any Christian Church. "Well,"
   someone says, "I believe that I am a Christian and that I can go to
   Heaven without being baptized, or joining a Church, or even going to
   the Communion Table." Yes, I know that is what you think, but that
   course of conduct of yours is, in my opinion, calculated to imperil the
   success of Christ's cause! If it is right for you to act thus, then
   every other Christian has as much right to act thus as you have--and
   suppose that everybody were to do as you are doing--that would be an
   end to the visible Church of Christ and to the maintenance of the
   visible ordinances of Christ--and this would be most perilous to the
   success of Christ's cause! Just think of that, I pray you, and if you
   are leaving undone that which you ought to do, or are doing anything
   which has a tendency to imperil the success of Christ's cause, repent
   of it and forsake it, lest it should turn out that, after all, you are
   not a loyal subject and soldier in the army of King Jesus!--

   "Put on the Gospel armor, And watching unto prayer, Where duty calls,
   or danger, Be never wanting there."

   (7) . "Misbehaves or induces others to misbehave before the enemy."

   I do not quite know what "misbehavior" of a soldier may mean, but I
   know that a Christian should never misbehave, because he is always in
   the presence of the enemy. You must never say, "Oh, now, you know, I
   may do what I like for there is nobody looking." Is there not? Your
   great Captain is certainly looking--and it is frequently when men think
   they are least seen that they are the most observed! The world has an
   eagle's eye for a Christian's faults! It tries to see faults where
   there are none--and where there are small faults, it is sure to magnify
   them! For my part, I am very glad it is so, and I say, let the world
   watch us--it will help us to be the more exact in our conduct! If we
   are ashamed to be seen anywhere, it must be because we have good reason
   to be ashamed! Let us endeavor to live so that we need not be ashamed--

   "Lord I desire to live as one

   Who bears a blood-bought name.

   As one who fears but grieving You

   And knows no other shame.

   As one by whom Your walk below

   Should never be forgot--

   As one who gladly would keep apart

   From all You love not."

   When I was pastor at Waterbeach there was a young man who joined the
   Church and who seemed to run well for a time. But the village feast
   came round and there was a good deal of drunkenness and all sorts of
   low merriment. The young man went into the dancehall, but he had not
   been there many minutes before someone came to him and said, "Don't you
   belong to Spurgeon?" He tried to deny it, but there were many others
   who knew it was true and, before long he was thrown out of a window.
   The world pitched him out as a hypocrite! And shortly afterwards, the
   Church also turned him out as a hypocrite, so that he was disowned by
   both the Church and the world. And I think that by the Grace of God,
   this led him to a hearty and true repentance. I was thankful that the
   worldlings kept such a watch over the members of my Church that they
   would not see them acting wrongly without making them suffer for it!
   And I hope they will serve you in the same way if any of you try to act
   as that young man did. You must be one thing or the other--either
   wholly for Christ or wholly for His enemies! If you are not prepared to
   be out-and-out for Jesus Christ, do not pretend to enlist in His army.
   If you want to "hold with the hare, and run with the hounds," we shall
   certainly not ask you to join our ranks. There must be nothing of this
   kind of spirit among good soldiers of Jesus Christ. May God keep us
   free from

   it!

   (8). "Leaves his commanding officer to go in search of plunder "

   Oh, dear! Have I not known some who professed to be soldiers in
   Christ's army who have done this? They thought there was something to
   be gained elsewhere, so they left Christ in "search of plunder." There
   was one who did this in Paul's day, of whom the Apostle wrote, "Demas
   has forsaken me, having loved this present world." "Oh, but," says one,
   "would you not have me marry when there was money to be had, even
   though it was to a worldly man?" Or, "an ungodly woman?" You can do so
   if you want to leave Christ "to go in search of plunder." "Would you
   not have me take a job where I could get several hundreds of pounds a
   year even though I had to mix with ungodly men, and to do unrighteous
   things?" O you mean-spirited wretch, how little are you worthy to be
   numbered among those who are descended from the martyrs for the Truth
   of God! How little are you worthy to be among those who follow the Lamb
   wherever He goes! The Lord teaches those who are really His people that
   "godliness with contentment is great gain" and, therefore, for Christ's
   sake, they can afford to despise and lose all other so-called "gain"!

   "But," says one, "I don't know where we should be if we were so
   scrupulous and exact as that." I can tell you where you would be--you
   would be walking in the light as God is in the light, and you would
   have fellowship with Him--and you would be no loser by acting thus, but
   you would be a gainer all round, for Christ has assured you that no one
   shall leave houses, or lands, or husband, or wife, or children for the
   Kingdom's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this present
   time and, in the world to come, life everlasting! If you cannot lose
   for Christ, you have already lost Christ, for He said, "Whoever does
   not bear his cross and come after Me, cannot be My disciple." He who
   loves the world better than Christ loves not Christ at all! God save us
   from being of that character!

   Time would fail me if I mentioned all the offenses specified in this
   list, so I will pass on to number 15 in the Act--

   (15). "By discharging firearms, drawing swords, beating drums, making
   signals, using words, or by any means whatever intentionally occasions
   false alarms in action, on the march, in the field, or elsewhere."

   It is a very great sin on the part of Christian soldiers to make false
   alarms to discourage and dispirit their fellow soldiers. There are some
   professors who seem to delight to tell us of a new discovery in science
   which is supposed to destroy our faith. Science makes a wonderful
   discovery and straightaway we are expected to doubt what is plainly
   revealed in the Word of God! Considering that the so-called "science"
   is continually changing and that it seems to be the rule for scientific
   men to contradict all who have gone before them--and that if you take
   up a book upon almost any science, you will find that it largely
   consists of repudiations of all former theories--I think we can afford
   to wait until the scientific men

   have made up their minds as to what science really is! In any event, we
   have no cause to be distressed concerning science, so let no
   Christian's heart fail him--and let him not raise any alarm in the camp
   of Christ!

   Some raise these alarms by slandering their fellow Christians. I will
   say very few words about this matter, but they must be very strong
   ones. That man is grossly guilty who makes up a lie or who reports a
   lie against one who is his Brother or Sister in Christ. We are all
   faulty enough, but let us go with the mantle of charity and cover up
   the faults of others and never expose them. Those who raise false
   alarms of this sort deserve to be tried by court martial and to receive
   some very exemplary punishment for such a grave offense!

   (16). "Treacherously makes known the password to any person not
   entitled to receive it; or, without good and sufficient cause, gives
   apassword different from what he received."

   It is a great crime to give the wrong password to Christ's army. Our
   password is, "blood." It is an offensive word to many people, but we
   know that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. I
   pray God that every stone of this Tabernacle may tumble to its ruin and
   every timber be splintered to atoms before there should stand on this
   platform a man to preach who denies the substitutionary Sacrifice of
   Jesus Christ, or who even keeps it in the background, for this is our
   password! You shall know us among all professors by the emphasis which
   we lay upon Atonement by the blood of Jesus Christ! Of the redeemed in
   Glory we read, "These are they which came out of great tribulation and
   have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
   And the saints on earth join in John's Doxology, "Unto Him that loved
   us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings
   and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion
   forever and ever. Amen." "The precious blood of Jesus" is our password
   in life, and the password with which we hope to enter through the gates
   of death into eternal Glory and blessedness--

   "Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood Shall never lose its power, Till
   all the ransomed Church of God Is saved to sin no more." Further on in
   this list, I notice another suggestive crime--

   (18). "Being a sentinel, commits any of the following offenses; that is
   to say, sleeps or is drunk on his post; or leaves his post before he is
   regularly relieved."

   Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, "Let us not sleep, as do others; but
   let us watch and be sober." And this is one of the duties of every
   Christian, for all Christ's soldiers are sentinels, watchmen on the
   walls of Zion! Then again, it is our duty not to leave our post till we
   are regularly relieved. Do you not think that some teachers leave the
   Sunday school before they are regularly relieved? I think they do.
   There are some who get tired of the work and leave it. I do not think
   you can truthfully say that you are regularly relieved of any work
   until you find a suitable successor--and I hope that some of us will
   never be regularly relieved until we close our eyes in death. Our
   prayer is that we may die in harness--

   "Our body with our charge lay down, And cease at once to work and
   live."

   Who wishes to be regularly relieved from Christ's service except it is
   by receiving his crown and entering into his

   rest?--

   "The land of triumph lies on high,

   There are no fields of battle there!

   Lord, I would conquer till I die

   And finish all the glorious war.

   Let every flying hour confess

   I gain Your Gospel fresh renown!

   And when my life and labors cease,

   May I possess the promised crown!" Still further on, I notice that this
   is put down--

   (23). "Disobeys any lawful command given by his superior officer in the
   execution of his office. " I know of only one superior Officer in
   Christ's army, and that is our blessed Lord and Master, Jesus Christ,
   the Captain of our salvation! He said to His disciples, "One is your
   Master; even Christ, and all you are brethren." And He also said to
   them, "A new commandment I give unto you, That you love one another, as
   I have loved you, that you also love

   one another." Mind that you do not disobey that command of your
   superior Officer--"Love one another." Be true brethren to one another.
   You know that when Jesus had washed His disciples' feet, He said to
   them, "If I, then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you,
   also, ought to wash one another's feet." Imitate this action of your
   Captain by rendering any service that you can to those who are your
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ. Seek their good for edification and be
   not easily provoked, but abound in that charity which "thinks no evil;
   bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all
   things."

   Keep every command of your Master. I put the question to the conscience
   of everyone of you who profess to be Christ's soldiers. Is there any
   one of His commands that you know of that you have not kept? I will not
   mention one even if I could do so, but I ask you whether there is one
   command of Christ which you know is His command, which you have not
   kept? You may think that the command is only a little one, but the
   spirit which thinks it is little is not a little evil, but a great
   evil! If you get a small stone in your boot, you know how it affects
   you in walking--and a little thing on the conscience, no matter how
   little it is, causes great trouble in a Christian's life. Blisters,
   very painful ones, will be upon the spiritual foot if there is either
   an omission or a commission that is knowingly indulged in contrary to
   the command of Christ. We are not saved by our works, but when we are
   saved, we are saved from sin, saved from disobedience, saved from
   unholiness, saved from selfishness-- saved in order that we may live no
   longer unto ourselves but unto Him that loved us and gave Himself for
   us.

   (25 & 26). The last two articles in the list are these-- "Deserts or
   attempts to desert from Her Majesty's Service; persuades, endeavors to
   persuade, procures, or attempts to procure anyperson subject to
   military law to desert from Her Majesty's Service.'"

   Brothers and Sisters, you and I, when we enlisted in Christ's army,
   entered it for life, did we not? I never believed in any system of
   salvation which comes to an end. There are some who believe that you
   may be saved today and lost tomorrow. Well, if they like that sort of
   salvation, they are welcome to it! I do not want it, nor would I have
   it as a gift. But the salvation that I received when I believed in
   Jesus Christ was everlasting salvation--that salvation of which the
   Apostle writes to the Hebrews, "that by two immutable things, in which
   it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation,
   who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us." Many
   of us, like Paul, bear in our body the marks of the Lord Jesus. Does
   anyone ask, "Where are those marks?" Well, some of us have the
   watermark which has been buried with Christ by Baptism into death. That
   is the outside mark. And then in our hearts we have another mark which
   the Spirit put upon us in that day when we passed from death unto life
   by His regenerating power. If these marks are really on us and in us,
   we shall never desert from our Lord's service, but shall be faithful
   even unto death!

   Possibly there is someone here who has turned back in the day of battle
   and become a deserter. Where are you, my Friend? I am glad to see you
   once more, for it is a long while since you were last here. You used to
   be a member of the Church and you made a great profession, but you know
   where you have been lately--you have been serving Satan. May God help
   you to desert from the devil's service and may you never go back to it
   again! If you ever were the servant of God, return, O Backslider, and
   return at once!--

   "Return, O wanderer, to your home,

   Your Father calls for thee!

   No longer now an exile roam

   In guilt and misery--

   Return, return!"

   He that has been a mere professor and has turned back, must be branded,
   "Deserter." No, not on his flesh, but on his conscience, seared as with
   a hot iron! Some desert because they have grown rich and can no longer
   associate with poor Christian people. Some desert because they have
   become poor and they say they have no clothes fit to come in, as if any
   sort of clothes were needed beyond such as might cover a man decently!
   Any clothes, if they are paid for, are fit to wear to this place of
   worship! But let those who say they are too poor to come, remember that
   it is in poverty and in sickness that a man most needs the Gospel and,
   therefore, the lower he gets in the world, the more closely he ought to
   cling to Christ! Yet, alas, there are some who desert because of
   poverty, and some because of wealth. O you deserters, may the Lord have
   mercy upon you and grant that you may not be real deserters, but may
   come back to the colors! Our Great Captain is ready to receive you and
   to forgive you, for He says, "Him that come to Me I will in no wise
   cast out." Yes, even though

   8 Discipline in Christ's Army Sermon #3188

   you are a deserter, if you do but come to Christ, He will receive you
   graciously, love you freely and His anger shall be turned away from
   you. God bless you, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

The Tenderness of God's Comfort

   (No. 3189)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 17, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you shall
   be comforted in Jerusalem." Isaiah 66:13.

   WE do not intend entering into a discussion of the context and its
   relationship literally to the Jewish people. We have never hesitated to
   assert our conviction that there are great blessings in store for God's
   ancient Israel and that the day shall come when her comfort shall
   abound, when the glory of the Gentiles shall flow to her like a flowing
   stream and she shall be comforted by her God as one whom his mother
   comforts. But we believe that these passages are applicable to all the
   servants of God, that the comfortable passages of Scriptures are
   theirs, that whether Jew or Gentile, bond or free, barbarian or Greek,
   we are all one in Christ Jesus--and all the promises are ours in
   Him--for in Him all the promises are, "yes," and, "amen." I believe,
   then, that this passage belongs to every child of God.

   It is well that there is such a promise as this on record, for
   Believers need comfort. They need comfort because they are men and,
   "man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward." There has been a
   great necessity for consolation ever since the time when man was
   expelled from Eden. Men need comfort because they are but men. Although
   favored by God, elected by His Sovereignty and called by His Divine
   Grace into a peculiar state of acceptance, they are still in the body
   and they are made to feel it--being tempted in all points as other men
   are and in some points peculiarly tried. They are men and but men at
   the best! They need comfort, too, because they are Christians, for if
   others escape the rod, Christians must not, yes, shall not The Lord may
   be pleased to give to the sinner a long prosperity that he may be
   fattened as a bullock for the slaughter, but His promise to His people
   whom He calls by His Grace is, "You only have I known of all the
   families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your
   iniquities." "Whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son
   whom He receives." We must, therefore, have special consolation, since
   as men, as only men, and as Christians, we shall have constant
   occasions for comfort.

   When I take a text like this, I know there are very many in the
   congregation who cannot enter into it. But, my dear Friends, if you are
   Christians, it will not be long before you will! You may have to look
   back, perhaps, upon the words which I quote in your hearing, and say of
   them, "God sent them to me as a preparation before the trial came. He
   gave me food as He did Elijah under the juniper tree, because He
   determined that I should go 40 days in the strength of that meat."
   Despise not the consolations of the Lord because you need them not just
   now. You will require them. The calm will not last forever--a storm is
   brewing. Say not, "My mountain stands firm, I shall never be moved." He
   has but to hide His face and you will be troubled--and then you will
   prize that which now you do lightly esteem--you will long to be
   comforted "as one whom his mother comforts."

   But coming at once to the text, I think we may very well talk of it
   under three points. First, who comforts? Secondly, how He comforts. And
   thirdly, where He comforts.

   I. With regard to the first point, WHO COMFORTS? "As one whom his
   mother comforts, so will I comfort you."

   The work of comforting His saints is not too low for God to be engaged
   in. It is true that He sometimes uses instruments, but all real comfort
   to a broken heart must come directly from God, Himself. He does not
   say, "I will send an angel to comfort you," but, "I will comfort you."
   Nor in the text is it said that the Christian minister shall comfort
   you. Alas, dear Brothers and Sisters, often what are we who preach the
   Word but broken cisterns that hold no water? But God says, "I will
   comfort you." And when He undertakes the work, then we become as
   conduit pipes that are full, even to bursting, with the drink that you
   require! Your soul shall be satisfied even out of poor earthen vessels.
   But it must be

   God's work. He must do it, for when a soul is truly humbled, heavily
   laden and broken in pieces by God's hand, there is only one hand--the
   pierced hand--that can heal the wound!

   When we read, in this passage, that God will comfort the soul, we are
   to understand, I think, that God does so in the Trinity of His Person.
   He is called "the God of Consolation." The Father comforts us. The very
   use of that term, "Father," seems to bring good cheer to our spirits.
   As long as I can call God, my Father, I shall not be without a star in
   my sky. "My Father"--that sweetens all the sorrow that can come to me!
   It is a sword, but my Father, it is in Your hand. It is a bitter cup,
   but, my Father, You have given it to me, so shall I not drink it? That
   word, "my Father," shall make my heart leap for joy in the midst of my
   deepest distress! As a Father, God does actively come to the comfort of
   His children--and when a filial spirit is shed abroad in us, our souls,
   leaning on all-sufficient Grace, rejoice even in the midst of deep
   distress! God the Son also comforts us, for is not His name, "the
   Consolation of Israel"? When you stand at the foot of the Cross, you
   find comfort, there, for all the ills that wring your heart. Sin loses
   its weight. Death, itself, is dead. All griefs expire--slain by the
   griefs of the Man of Sorrows. Only enter into the Savior's passion and
   your own passion is over. Get to understand His sorrows and your
   sorrows find at least a pause, if not an end. And as for the blessed
   Spirit, He was given for this very purpose, to be our Comforter. He
   dwells in all the saints to bring to their remembrance the things which
   Jesus spoke and to lead them into all the Truth of God that their joy
   in Christ may be full!

   It is something very delightful to consider that Father, Son and Spirit
   all cooperate to give us comfort. I can understand their cooperating to
   make the world. I can understand their cooperation in the salvation of
   a soul. But I am astonished at this same united action in so
   comparatively small a matter as the comfort of Believers! Yet the Holy
   Three seem to think it a great matter that Believers should be happy,
   or they would not work together to cheer disconsolate spirits.

   We must understand, when God says, "I will comfort you," that He
   intends that there are many ways by which He does it. Sometimes He
   comforts us in the course of Providence. We may be the lowest spoke of
   the wheel, now, but by the revolution of time we may be the uppermost
   before long. We may suffer very acute pains, tonight, but by the
   morning the Master may have relieved all our pain. The pause between
   sickness and health may not be very long. If the Good Physician shall
   put His healing hands upon us, we shall soon be restored. How often,
   when you thought you were coming to your worst, has there been a sudden
   brightening of the sky! It is a long lane that has no turning and it is
   a long trouble that never comes to an end. It is when the sea ebbs as
   far as it can go that the tide begins to flow--and they say the darkest
   part of the night is that which is just before the daybreak. When the
   winter grows very cold and keen, we begin to hope that spring will soon
   come--and our desperate sorrows, when they reach their worst--are
   coming to their close. So let us be of good cheer! There will not be
   always such a rough sea, poor troubled Saint. You shall be out of the
   Atlantic into the Pacific before long--and you shall be out of the sea,
   altogether, and away on the terra firma of eternal joy before many
   years have rolled over your head!

   However, when the Lord is not pleased thus to comfort us in the way of
   Providence, He has a means of doing it by His Omnipotent secret working
   on the human heart. Not to speak doctrinally, but rather to give a
   particular instance, have you not found that sometimes, when you were
   much burdened with trouble, a very peculiar calm came over your spirit?
   You had been vexed, almost distracted. But when you woke one morning,
   you felt calm and peaceful--you had given up rebellion, left off
   murmuring, and you could say to your God--

   "'Tis sweet to lie passive in Your hands And know no will but Yours."
   And have you not even been conscious, in times of the very severest
   trouble, of an unusual joy? You did not sing with your voice, but there
   was something that sang with you softly, silently, but still sweetly.
   You sometimes look back upon that sick chamber, (I know I do), and
   almost wish that you were there now. The trial was sharp, indeed, for--

   "Sharp are the pangs that nature gives"-- but, oh, the joy that came
   with them! It was so surpassing that, in the retrospect, you forget the
   pain and only remember the sweetness! How was this? Was it the pain
   that did it? Nothing of the kind! God is like a watchmaker who knows,
   because he made the watch, how to touch the wheels and regulate them.
   He made us and, therefore, He knows how to deal with us so that
   everything shall go right where before everything went amiss. He can
   open the floodgates of joy and inundate our souls with bliss even in
   our darkest days of trouble! "Only hope you in Me, My child," He says,
   "for you shall praise Me, who is the help of your countenance and your
   God." Though the fig trees do not blossom and God does not

   take away the plague from the cattle. Though your substance shall be
   diminished and fire shall devour your household goods, yet your God can
   make up for all this and cause your days of leanness to be fat
   days--and your days of hunger to be days of feasting--and your days of
   thirst to be days when you shall drink the wine on the lees
   well-refined!

   It would not be well to close this point without remarking that God has
   been pleased to make a previous provision for the comfort of all His
   saints. When He comforts, He has not to invent a novelty to do it--He
   has only to bring to us stores which have been laid up, fruits new and
   old which have been ready for His beloved. It trouble comes, God has
   provided a strength by which you shall meet it, and provided a way
   through by which you shall escape from it. There are promises in God's
   Word suitable to every conceivable condition of the saints. Out of
   millions of God's people living in different countries, under different
   forms of government and in different ages--all of them of different
   temperaments and constitutions--their trials must take all kinds of
   shapes. As in the kaleidoscope, there must be a vast variety in the
   tribulations of the Lord's people and yet there never has arisen a
   single case in which there has not been a promise which, word for word,
   and letter for letter, met the case in hand!

   In the great bunch of keys in that good old Book, there is a key for
   every lock! And if it were not so, there are one or two promises like
   master keys which will fit all. Such a promise is the one in Isaiah
   41:10, "Fear you not, for I am with you: be not dismayed; for I am your
   God." It will suit the youth and the gray-head. It will be satisfactory
   to you if you have to overcome difficulties or if you have to endure
   sufferings. In the calm or in the storm, lying in the trench or
   climbing the scaling ladder, that text will still be precious--"Fear
   you not, for I am with you: be not dismayed; for I am your God." We
   will fall back, then, upon the consolatory Truth that with God are the
   consolations of His children, that He is Himself responsible for their
   comfort, having engaged to be their Father! And so we may suck marrow
   out of our text, "As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort
   you."

   II. But now the second head is to be HOW GOD COMFORTS. "As one whom his
   mother comforts."

   This is a peculiarly delightful metaphor. A father can comfort, but I
   think he is not much at home in the work. When God speaks about His
   pity, He compares Himself to the father. "Like as a father pities his
   children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him." But when He speaks
   about comfort, He selects the mother. When I have seen the little ones
   sick, I have felt all the pity in the world for them, but I did not
   know how to set to work to comfort them--but a mother knows by instinct
   how to do it! There is placed in the mother's tender heart a power of
   sympathy and very soon she finds the word or gives the touch that will
   meet her darling's case and cheer its troubled soul. The father is
   awkward at it--our rougher, sterner nature hardly shines in the matter
   of consolation. But the mother can do it to perfection. How, then, does
   the mother comfort her child?

   We answer, first, she does it very fondly. There is a way of
   administering comfort in which you stand apart from the patient and you
   tell him, "There is the cup of cordial if you'd like to drink it." But
   the mother's way of doing it is to sip the cup and then to put it to
   the child's lips, yes, and to do more than that--to take the child
   right into her bosom while she gives it. She does not talk to him at
   arm's length, but she talks with him at her heart all the while! And
   that is probably the secret of her power. And so, when God comforts any
   poor heavy-laden sinner or troubled saint, He does not talk to Him at a
   distance, but He runs and falls on his neck and kisses him. The
   Infinite, Almighty God falls upon the neck of a repentant sinner and
   gives him the kiss of His love! And He does just the same to a poor,
   troubled and afflicted saint. He comforts fondly. May one venture to
   apply such a word as that to the great God? May we say that He has a
   fondness for His children? Well, at any rate, we know that if there is
   a word more sweet, more dear, indicating a closer affinity and a deeper
   and purer love than another, we may use that word concerning our God.
   He loves us with a love that has no bottom, no summit and no shore.
   Even as He loves His own dear Son, so He loves us! We are in His heart!
   We are engraved on the palms of His hands and, therefore, when He
   comforts, it is in so fond a manner that we cannot but be cheered! With
   all the tenderness a mother feels, God feels for us--and so He comforts
   us as a mother comforts her child.

   But there is more than fondness here. A mother comforts her child with
   much sympathy. She always seems to feel the pain the child is feeling.
   To soothe that headache, she lays her cool hand upon the hot, throbbing
   little brow, and is herself pained as she thinks of the pain that must
   be there. Or she looks at the hand that was made to bleed by a fall,
   and her eyes seem as if they would bleed for the little one. She feels
   it all and, therefore, she is sure to comfort well. And this is how
   Jesus comforts. We have heard of a little child who said to her mother,
   "Mother, Mrs. So-and-So, the widow, says she likes me to go in to see
   her, for I comfort her so. When she sits and cries, I put my head in
   her lap and I cry, too, and she says that comforts her." Ah, yes,
   child, there is true philosophy in that! This is just the sort of
   comfort we need and this is just what God does. Our Lord in human flesh
   still sorrows with His people--hungers in their hunger--thirsts in
   their thirsting--and melts in their mourning. Though He reigns on high,
   He is not so high that He has no "respect unto the lowly."

   A mother also comforts her child very diligently. She is not satisfied
   with saying half a dozen words and putting her child down. She takes it
   up and if it won't be dandled on one knee, she tries the other, and if
   that form of comfort will not do, she will try another. We have heard
   of a good mother who wanted to teach her child something but when
   someone complained that she had to repeat the same thing 20 times, she
   answered, "Yes, I did that because 19 times would not do." So God
   perseveres. Sometimes a mother may have to comfort her child when it is
   very sick and very fretful, and its poor little head and heart are out
   of order. She has to comfort it again, and again, and again, and again.
   Soft words are always on her lips. She can do nothing else but console
   the little one and she does not tire of it. Oh, those mothers of ours!
   They never grow tired when we are sick and ill! They seem to be up all
   night and all day long. And if a nurse comes in for a few hours, they
   are up, then, too, looking after the nurse, so that I do not know that
   much ease comes with the helper. Our mothers are so untiringly kind!
   Well, I say to you--to "you who unto Jesus for refuge have fled"--that
   our God is kinder than any mother! His Book is full of attempts to
   comfort His children and those attempts--blessed be God--are not
   without success!

   Again, a mother comforts her child seasonably. A true mother is not
   always comforting her child. If she is a silly mother, she brings up
   her child so delicately that it turns out to be a viper in her bosom.
   But if she is a wise mother, she saves her comforts till they are
   needed. When it is sick, then she gives the cordials. Well, God does
   not always comfort His saints, but when they are in affliction, then
   they shall have consolation. As our tribulations abound, so our
   consolations abound by Jesus Christ. There is a balance kept up. If
   there is an ounce of trouble, there will be an ounce of comfort. If
   there is a ton of trouble, there will be a ton of consolation. When the
   child has been doing wrong and the parent has chastised it, if the
   little lip curls, if the proud foot is stamped, if there is a frown on
   the brow--the wise mother does not comfort it. But when the child comes
   and prays to be forgiven, the mother's heart is ready for it directly.
   "Sin no more," she says, "and the past shall be forgotten and
   forgiven." Well, this is how God comforts us. While we are proud and
   stand out against Him, we shall feel His hand. But when we confess our
   faults and come humbly to Him for pardon, we shall have seasonable
   comfort, "as one whom his mother comforts."

   Again, a mother's comfort has this point about it--she usually comforts
   in a most efficient manner--and the child goes away smiling, though it
   seemed to say before, "I shall never be happy again." Five minutes of a
   mother's wise talk and sweet comfort, and the child is as happy as
   before! "Ah," you say, "that will do for children, but it won't do for
   men." But God keeps His saints as children before Him. May God grant us
   Grace to be as little children, or we cannot enter the Kingdom of
   Heaven! Then, when our God comes to comfort us, I am quite sure He will
   do it more effectually than the most tender mother can.

   But, once more, a mother comforts all her life. "A mother is a mother
   all her life," says an old proverb. There is no change there. "Can a
   woman forget her suckling child, that she should not have compassion on
   the son of her womb?" It seems impossible, but the Lord says, "Yes,
   they may forget, yet will I not forget you." A mother casts not away
   her child. Fathers sometimes have done such a thing, but mothers, I
   should hope, never! But even if they have--

   "Yet," says the Lord, "should Nature change, And mothers monsters
   prove, Sion still dwells upon the heart Of everlasting love."

   God will not cease to comfort His people! Perhaps there is a Brother
   who is passing through a very severe trial and he thinks he shall never
   be comforted again. Well, but your mother will not forsake you--and do
   you think God will? "But," says one, "you do not know my difficulty. It
   is a crushing one." My dear Friend, I know I do not know it, but your
   heavenly Father knows it. And do you suppose if an earthly mother
   sticks fast by her child, that He will leave you? Go to Him! His heart
   is as near to you, now, as when you were on the mountain rejoicing in
   the full sunshine of His love. The very shadow of a change is unknown
   to Him. Go to Him with confidence and humble faith and you shall find
   the text, true, "As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort
   you."

   III. Now I have just a little to say upon the third point, that is,
   WHERE GOD COMFORTS His people. The text

   says, "in Jerusalem."

   Why, for His ancient people, that was where they had their troubles.
   The city had been under siege. O daughter of Salem, how were you made
   to weep! What sorrow rolled over your head--to see the city dismantled
   and her palaces become ruins--wild fowls and bitterns inhabiting the
   place where once the assembled tribes were glad! O Jerusalem, what
   grief is in your name to your inhabitants as they remember these, your
   glory, all departed, and your sorrow lasting still! Yes, but God will
   comfort His people in the very place of their trouble! This will be
   fulfilled on a large scale in the Millennial Glory when our world,
   which has been the scene of the saints' sorrow, will also be the scene
   of their triumphant reign with Christ Jesus!

   Meanwhile, you, His servants, must not suppose that because you have
   trials, you are in the wrong place. The vine is not in the wrong place
   because the vinedresser often uses the knife! It may be the best place
   for that vine where it gets most of the vinedresser's pruning. Beware,
   especially young friends, beware of self-will in seeking to change your
   troubles! Some of you think when you are single you have peculiar
   troubles--do not be in at hurry to incur the troubles of married life!
   And you who are servants who think you are very harshly done by, do not
   be so wondrously fast to wish to be masters! I sometimes find my cross
   not just what I like it to be, but I should be very much afraid to
   attempt to alter it. "It were better in all wisdom to bear the ills we
   have than fly to others that we know not of." That man whom you envy,
   you would probably pity if you knew more about him! Be content to stay
   in Jerusalem.

   Remember, the comfort which God gives will be a comfort to suit your
   present place and position. "In Jerusalem," where you have seen the
   furnace of God placed, for His fire is in Zion and His furnace in
   Jerusalem," even there shall you have your comfort! It is a joy to
   think of Daniel in the lions' den. I believe that Daniel never had a
   sweeter night's rest than he had when he had some old lion for his
   pillow, and the younger lions to be his guardians. And in the case of
   Sha-drach, Meshach and Abednego, the Master did not break down the
   furnace walls and take them out at once, but He was with them in the
   fire and cheered them in the midst of the flames! So shall the comfort
   of God come to you in your time of need.

   Take another view of this matter. God will comfort you who are here
   below. "Oh, that I had the wings of a dove!" says one. Now what would
   you do if you had them? They would be a very awkward equipment for a
   man! But suppose you hadthe wings of a dove, what would you do? Would
   you fly away? Well, you would hardly dare to do that, for to fly to God
   without a permit would be taking the matter into your own hands. Why
   cannot God comfort you where you are? "Ah," says one, "I expect to have
   my happiness in another world." So do I, but I hope to have some, here,
   too. "One Heaven will be enough for me," says one. But why not have
   Heaven here and Heaven hereafter, too?--

   "The men of Grace have found

   Glory begun below.

   Celestial fruits on earthly ground

   From faith and hope may grow.

   The hill of Zion yields

   A thousand sacred sweets

   Before we reach the heavenly fields,

   Or walk the golden streets.

   Then let our songs abound,

   And every tear be dry--

   We're marching through Immanuel's ground

   To fairer worlds on high!"

   It is true that the fairer worlds are on high, but it is equally true
   that we are on Immanuel's ground even now! "In Jerusalem--the place of
   your trials--will I comfort you," says the Lord.

   And now, to come to another meaning of the passage, "in Jerusalem,"
   that is, in the Church of God. The richest comforts are reserved for
   those who, fearing the Lord, often speak, one to another, and are not
   ashamed to acknowledge His name. And I think, dear Friends, the place
   of comfort is the assembly of God's people. Therefore live, "not
   forsaking the assembling of yourselves together, as the manner of some
   is." There are people in the world who never go out to a

   weeknight service in the evening, and never think of doing such a
   thing! They get by the fireside after that day's business and there
   they sit, and say, "We are full of doubts and fears. We cannot rejoice
   as we used to do--

   "What peaceful hours we once enjoyed!

   How sweet their memory still!'"

   And so on. Now, those people expect God to go to their house and
   comfort them. By what reason should they expect any such thing when
   they refuse to go to God's House for the comfort? Our Lord will
   sometimes withhold a sense of His Presence from us in order to make us
   feel our wrong-doing in staying away from the use of the means which He
   has appointed for our comfort and consolation. I would that all
   congregations come out as well as you usually do. I must not say
   anything to you about not coming out on a weeknight, for you do
   come--and anything I might say about people not coming would be like
   Dean Swift's sermon about those who go to sleep in church. When he
   finished it, he thought he had done no good, "for," he said, "only you
   who were awake have heard it."

   I would rather propose to you that whenever you meet a friend who is
   greatly in lack of comfort and is complaining that he has not got it,
   you would give as judicious a hint as you can that it may be that they
   miss the comfort who miss the means of Grace! He who will not go to the
   shop and buy, cannot wonder if he has not any oil for his lamp. He who
   will not take the trouble to go to the stream must not marvel if he has
   to suffer thirst. O let us, dear Friends, as often as we can, gather
   together with the Lord's people for praise and prayer! No doubt, "in
   Jerusalem" we shall find our comfort! There are those among you to whom
   it does one good to listen when you speak of your enjoyments in this
   house. Of course there are some who are not edified by the ministry
   here, but if that is the case, why do they not go somewhere else? Their
   seats could be filled by others who would be edified. But there are
   some who say, "Master, it does us good to come here, and we can bless
   the Lord that He here makes the place of His feet glorious. We long for
   Sunday to come round again, for we feel the place to be like an Elim."
   In your case, God always makes His House to be a fountain of Living
   Waters to your souls and streams from Lebanon.

   To that end, I pray the Master to help all His servants. Pray for your
   ministers, but remember that the comfort cannot come from them. It may
   come through them, but it must come from the Master, Himself. With that
   exhortation, we will come back to the words of the text, and the
   gracious promise, "As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort
   you, and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. "

   May God add His blessing and bring troubled sinners to look to Christ,
   and Christ shall have the glory! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: COLOSSIANS2.

   Verse 1. For I would that you knew what great conflict Ihave for you
   and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in
   the flesh. Paul had not met these Colossian Christians, but he had
   heard of their faith, hope, and love--and he so desired their good that
   he had a continual care for them in his heart. He carried that care to
   God in prayer, yet he still bore them in loving remembrance. They were
   always on his heart as a sick child is always on the heart of its
   mother.

   2, 3. That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in
   love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to
   the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of
   Christ In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. He
   wanted them to know God and to rest comforted and happy in what He
   revealed. He saw in them a tendency to look abroad for something more
   than that--a desire to tack something else to the Gospel, a wish to try
   and find some fresh light outside the Word--and over this he greatly
   grieved. He himself was more than satisfied with the Gospel and he
   wanted them to be, in that respect, as he was.

   4. And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
   They did not openly contradict the Gospel. They pretended to have a
   great affection for it and then they tried to tear the very heart out
   of it with their enticing words of man's wisdom!

   5. For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
   spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your
   faith in Christ He never forgot them and it was his joy, when he found
   them standing fast in Christ--but his sorrow and his horror when they
   went away after anyone else.

   6. As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in
   Him. "Do not turn away from Him, do not dream of going beyond Him. You
   received Him very simply at first--you trusted in Him entirely--so go
   on doing so. You were satisfied with Christ when you first came to Him,
   so be satisfied with Him, still, for you do not need anything more than
   Christ--and there is nothing more than Christ!"

   7. Rooted and built up in Him. "Take a living hold of Christ as a tree
   does of the soil. Also be built up in Him--as a building settles down
   upon the foundation--so do you settle down upon Christ."

   7. And established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding
   therein with thanksgiving. When a man is established in the Truth of
   God that he knows, and rejoices in what he has already received, he
   will not go away from it.

   8. Beware lest any man spoil you, (it might be rendered, "plunder
   you"), through philosophy and vein deceit "Beware of those who pretend
   that they are going to enrich you, but whose real objective is to
   plunder you. They say that they will give you advanced thought, deeper
   ideas, a system more congruous with the age. But it is--

   8. After the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and
   not after Christ "What do you want with their traditions? Christ has
   revealed His Truth to you. What do you want with the world's rudiments?
   You have gone beyond such elementary, useless knowledge as that, for
   you have got the Truth of God itself!"

   9. For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. In Christ
   we enter into the fullness and completeness of life both materially and
   spiritually!

   10. 11. Who is the Head of all principality andpower: in whom also you
   are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting
   off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ
   "The Jew boasts that he is a circumcised man, but you have spiritually
   all that circumcision meant literally! Even though you have not the
   wound in your flesh, you have more than that, for you have the death of
   the flesh and your very flesh has been buried with Christ. All that
   circumcision can possibly mean you have in Christ."

   12. Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with Him
   through the faith of the working of God, who has raised Him from the
   dead. "You have death, burial and resurrection, all in Christ. And you
   received the outward sign and token of this when you were baptized, so
   believe firmly that it is so and do not look anywhere else for it. You
   are neither dead nor buried apart from Christ, nor are you driven apart
   from Him--all you have is in Him."

   13. And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
   flesh, has He quickened together with Him, having forgiven all your
   trespasses. "You do not need to go to a 'priest' for pardon, for Christ
   has forgiven you all your

   trespasses. [See Sermons #2101, Volume 35--LIFE AND PARDON and #2605,
   Volume 45--DEATH AND ITS SENTENCE ABOLISHED.] You are so complete in
   Christ that confession to man and priestly absolution from man would be
   of no use to you."

   14. Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us,
   which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His
   Cross. "All the Mosaic ceremonies from which you were shut out as
   Gentiles, are abolished! Christ has driven a nail through them and
   fastened them up to His Cross." As sometimes a banker stamps a check
   when it is paid, so has Christ cut through the very heart of all Jewish
   ordinances by what He has done for His people.

   15. And having spoiled principalities and powers, He made a show of
   them openly, triumphing over them in it [See

   Sermon #273, Volume 5--CHRIST TRIUMPHANT.] Exhibiting them as His

   prisoners in a triumphal procession, as the victorious Roman generals
   did when they returned from war!

   16. Let no one, therefore, judge you in food, or in drink, or regarding
   a festival, or ofthe newmoon, or ofthe Sabbath. "Do not put yourselves
   under rules and regulations which God has not ordained. If you think it
   is right for you to abstain from certain drinks, do so, but do not act
   thus simply because others do so. If you abstain from certain foods
   because they have been offered to idols, and the consciences of others
   might be offended if you partook of them, do not act thus as though it
   would save you. Do not make yourself subject to the judgment of other
   men, for Christ is your Lawgiver and Lord."

   17. Which are a shadow of things to come; but the substance is of
   Christ "You can do without the shadow, now that you have the substance,
   so keep to that." Some men multiply church ordinances--they have this
   form and that form. Well, let them have them if they find them of
   service, but do not bring yourself under subjection to anything of the
   kind! Follow the New Testament and above all things keep close to
   Christ, for He is everything to you.

   18. Let no man beguile you of your reward in false humility We know
   those who say, "We do not know anything, we are only seekers, trying to
   find out the truth." They talk very humbly considering how desperately
   proud they really are, but that humility which makes men doubt is mock
   humility and is not of God! "Let no man beguile you of your reward."
   When you have learned the Truth of God from the Scriptures, be dogmatic
   about it! Do not be afraid of the presumption of which some will accuse
   you, or the bigotry which they will impute to you.

   18. And worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not
   seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind. Agnostics by their name
   confess that they do not know, but do not let them take away from you
   what you knowand set you to investigate matters which are beyond you
   with a judgment which they would lead you to think is well-near
   infallible, whereas your judgment is very fallible, indeed. Be not
   puffed up by your fleshly mind!

   19. And not holding the Head. That is the point--these people get away
   from the Deity of Christ! They get away from the atoning blood. They
   get away from glorifying Him who alone is the Truth!

   19. From which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment
   ministered, and knit together, increased with the increase of God. Take
   away the Head and there is death--everything is out of order then. If
   the Head is denied--if any Doctrine is taught which is contrary to the
   Glory of Christ, you have killed the body however much you may pretend
   to be increasing and feeding it!

   20-22. Therefore if you are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the
   world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to
   ordinances? (Touch not; taste not; handle not; which all are to perish
   with the using), after the commandments and doctrines of men? You may
   and you should feel that there are some things which you will not
   touch, or taste, or handle. You had better leave poisonous drugs alone,
   but at the same time, if any man seeks to impose upon you any
   regulation concerning them as a part of the faith, you may resist it
   and repudiate it--and plead your freedom in Christ.

   23. Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in wiil-worship. There
   were some of the Jews who would not eat certain kinds of meat, and
   others who would fast for long periods. Some thought it was very wicked
   to eat meat on a certain day--and there were many such notions--and
   similar superstitions still survive among us, such as not eating meat
   on Fridays, being afraid of 13 people sitting at table and so on! But
   you have nothing to do with all that kind of rubbish, so get away from
   it! If you are a Believer in Christ, tread all such nonsense under your
   feet. "Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship."--

   23. And humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honor. There
   is no honor about such things, they are con-temptible--"not in any
   honor"--

   23. To the satisfying of the flesh. That is all such things would
   do--make you seem better than other people--so do not be led into these
   ways, but stand fast in the liberty in which Christ has made His people
   free!

Christ in Gethsemane

   (No. 3190)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 24, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   1, 1879.

   "And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane." Mark 14:32.

   [Other Sermons by Mr. Spurgeon upon "Christ in Gethsemane," are #493,
   Volume 9--GETHSEMANE; #693, Volume 12--THE GARDEN OF THE SOUL; #1199,
   Volume 20--THE AGONY IN GETHSEMANE and #494, Volume 9--THE BETRAYAL.]

   OUR Lord had been sitting at the table of happy fellowship with His
   disciples, talking to them in a very solemn and impressive manner. He
   then delivered those choice discourses which are recorded by John and
   offered that wonderful prayer which deserves to always be called, "The
   Lord's Prayer." Knowing all that was to befall Him, He and His
   disciples left the upper room and started to go to His usual place of
   quiet retreat, "a place which was named Gethsemane." You can easily
   picture their descent into the street. The moon was at the full on the
   Paschal night and it was very cold, for we read that the high priest's
   servants had kindled a fire and warmed themselves, because it was cold.
   As Jesus walked along the narrow streets of Jerusalem, He doubtless
   still spoke to His disciples in calm and helpful tones. And before long
   they came to the Brook Kidron over which David passed when Absalom
   stole away the hearts of the people from his father. So now, "great
   David's greater Son" must go the same way to the olive garden where He
   had often been before with His disciples. It was called Gethsemane,
   "the olive press." As we think of Christ in Gethsemane, I want you who
   love Him not only to adore Him, but to learn to imitate Him, so that
   when you are called to "drink of His cup," and to be baptized with the
   baptism wherewith He was baptized, you may behave as His true followers
   should and come forth from your conflict victorious as He came forth
   from His!

   At the very outset, there is one fact that I wish you to observe very
   particularly. Sudden changes from joy to grief have produced
   extraordinary results in those who have been affected by them. We have
   often read or heard of persons whose hair has turned white in a single
   night--such an extreme convulsion of mind has happened to them that
   they have seemed to be hurried forward into premature old age--at least
   in appearance, if not in fact. Many have died through unusual
   excitements of spirit. Some have dropped down dead through a sudden
   excess of joy and others have been killed by a sudden excess of grief.
   Our blessed Master must have experienced a very sudden change of
   feeling on that memorable night. In that great intercessory prayer of
   His, there is nothing like distress or tumult of spirit. It is as
   calm--as a lake unruffled by the zephyr's breath. Yet He is no sooner
   in Gethsemane than He says to the three especially favored disciples,
   "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death: tarry you here and
   watch with Me."

   I do not think that this great conflict arose through our dear Master's
   fear of death, nor through His fear of the physical pain and all the
   ignominy and shame that He was so soon to endure. But, surely, the
   agony in Gethsemane was part of the great burden that was already
   resting upon Him as His people's Substitute--it was this that pressed
   His spirit down even into the dust of death. He was to bear the full
   weight of it upon the Cross, but I am persuaded that the passion
   beganin Gethsemane. You know that Peter writes, "Who His own Self bore
   our sins in His own body on the tree." But we are not to gather from
   that passage that His substitutionary sufferings were limited to the
   tree, for the original might bear this rendering--that He bore our sins
   in His own body up to thetree--that He came up to the tree bearing that
   awful load and still continued to bear it on the tree! You remember
   that Peter also writes, in the same verse, "by whose stripes you were
   healed." These stripes did not fall upon Jesus when He was upon the
   Cross--it was in Pilate's Judgment Hall that He was so cruelly
   scourged! I believe that He was bearing our sins all His life, but that
   the terrible weight of them began to crush Him with sevenfold force
   when He came to the olive press, and that the entire mass rested upon
   Him

   with infinite intensity when He was nailed to the Cross--and so forced
   from Him the agonizing cry, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"

   In meditating upon this commencement of our Savior's unknown agonies,
   let us think first of THE CHOICE OF THE SPOT where those agonies were
   to be endured. Let us try to find out why He went to that particular
   garden on that dread night of His betrayal.

   First, the choice of Gethsemane showed His serenity of mind and His
   courage. He knew that He was to be betrayed, to be dragged before Annas
   and Caiaphas, Pilate and Herod--to be insulted, scourged and, at last
   to be led away to be crucified--but (mark the words), "He came out, and
   went, as He was known to do, to the Mount of Olives." It was His usual
   custom to go there to pray, so He would not make any change in His
   habits although He was approaching the supreme crisis of His earthly
   life. Let this courageous conduct of our Lord teach a lesson to all who
   profess to be His disciples. Whenever some trouble is about to come
   upon you, especially if it is a trouble that comes upon you because you
   are a Christian, do not be perturbed in spirit. Neglect no duty, but do
   as you have been known to do. The best way of preparing for whatever
   may be coming is to go on with the next thing in the order of
   Providence. If any child of God knew that he had to die tonight, I
   would recommend him to do just what he would do on any other Sabbath
   night, only to do it more earnestly and more devoutly than ever he had
   done it before! Blessed is that servant who, when his Master comes,
   shall be found discharging his duty as a servant--waiting upon his
   Master's household with all due orderliness and care. To go and stand
   outside the front door and stare up into the sky to see if the Master
   is coming, as some I know seem to do, is not at all as your Lord would
   have you act! You know how the angels rebuked the disciples for doing
   this--"You men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into Heaven?" Go
   and preach the Gospel in the power of the Holy Spirit and then, whether
   Christ comes sooner or later, you will be in the right posture to
   welcome Him! And He will commend you for carrying out, as far as you
   can, His last great commission to His disciples!

   Christ's courage is also evident from the fact that "Judas, also, who
   betrayed Him, knew the place, for Jesus often resorted there with His
   disciples." Nothing would have been easier than for our blessed Lord to
   have escaped from Judas if He had desired to do so, but He had no
   desire to escape, so He went boldly and deliberately to the place with
   which "the son of perdition" was well acquainted--the very place,
   indeed, to which the traitor at once conducted the officers who had
   been ordered to arrest the Master! May the Lord give to us similar
   courage whenever we are placed in a position in any respect like His
   was then! There are certain trials which, as a Christian, you cannot
   escape, and which you should not wish to escape. You do not like to
   think of them, but I would urge you to do so, not with fear and terror,
   but with the calm confidence of one who says, "I have a baptism to be
   baptized with and I am straitened until it is accomplished. I have a
   cup of which I must drink, I am eager to drink it. I do not court
   suffering, but if it is for Christ's sake, for the glory of God and the
   good of His Church, I do not wish to escape from it, but I will go to
   it calmly and deliberately, even as my Lord went to Gethsemane, though
   Judas knew the place where Jesus often resorted with His disciples."

   But, next, in the choice of this spot, our Lord also manifested His
   wisdom. For, first, it was to Him a place of holy memories. Under those
   old olive trees, so gnarled and twisted, He had spent many a night in
   prayer. And the silver moonbeams, glancing between the somber foliage
   had often illumined His blessed Person as He knelt there and wrestled
   and had communion with His Father. He knew how His soul had been
   refreshed while He had spoken there, face to face with the Eternal--how
   His face had been made to shine--and He had returned to the battle in
   Jerusalem's streets strengthened by His contact with the Almighty. So
   He went to the old trysting place, the familiar spot where holy
   memories clustered thick as bees about a hive, each one laden with
   honey. He went there because those holy memories aided His faith. And,
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, when your time of trial comes, you will
   do well to go to the spot where the Lord has helped you in the
   past--and where you have enjoyed much hallowed fellowship with Him.
   There are rooms where if the walls could tell all that has happened
   within them, a heavenly brightness might be seen because God has so
   graciously revealed Himself to us there in times of sickness and
   sorrow! One who had long lain in prison for Christ's sake, used to say,
   sometimes, after he had been released, "Oh, take me back to my dungeon,
   for I never had such blessed seasons of communion with my Lord as I had
   within that cold stone cell!" Well, if you have such a place, dear to
   you by many hallowed memories, go to it as your Master went to His
   sacred oratory in the Garden of Gethsemane, for there you will be
   likely to be helped even by the associations of the place.

   Our Lord's wisdom, in choosing that spot is also evident from the fact
   that it was a place of deep solitude and, therefore, most suitable for
   His prayers and cries on that doleful night. The place which is now
   called the Garden of Gethse-mane does not, according to some of the
   best judges, deserve that name. It is in far too exposed a position.
   But one always thinks of Gethsemane as a very quiet, lonely spot. And
   let me say that in my judgment, there is no place so suitable for
   solitude as an olive garden--especially if it is in terrace above
   terrace as in the South of France. I have frequently been sitting in an
   olive garden, and friends whom I would have been glad to see, have been
   within a few yards of me, yet I have not known that they were there!
   One beautiful afternoon, as two or three of us sat and read, we could
   see, a long way down, a black hat moving to and fro, but we could not
   see the wearer of it. We afterwards discovered that he was a brother
   minister whom we were glad to invite to join our little company. If you
   want to be alone, you can be so at any time you like in an olive
   garden--even if it is near town. What with the breaking up of the
   ground into terraces, the great abundance of foliage and the strange
   twisted trunks of the old trees, I know no place in which I would feel
   so sure of being quite alone as in an olive garden! And I think our
   Master went to Gethsemane for a similar reason. And burdened as He was,
   He needed to be in a solitary place. The clamorous crowd in Jerusalem
   would have been no fit companions for Him when His soul was exceedingly
   sorrowful, even unto death.

   It seems to me, also, that there is about an olive garden, either by
   day or by night, something congruous with sorrow. There are some trees
   that seem conducive to mirth--the very twinkling of their leaves would
   make one's heart dance with delight! But about the olive there is
   always something, not suggestive, perhaps, of absolute melancholy, but
   a matter-of-fact soberness as if in extracting oil out of the flinty
   rock, it had endured so much suffering that it had no inclination to
   smile, but stood there as the picture of everything that is somber and
   solemn. Our dear Master knew that there was something congenial to His
   exceeding sorrow in the gloom of the olive garden and, therefore, He
   went there on the night of His betrayal. Act with similar wisdom,
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, when your hour of trial is approaching!
   I have known some people rush into gay society to try to forget their
   grief, but that was folly. I have known others, in seasons of sorrow,
   seem to surround themselves with everything that is sad--that was also
   folly. Some, who have been in great trouble, have tried to hide it in
   frivolity, but that was still greater folly. It is a good thing, in
   times of grief, not to let your surroundings be either too somber or
   too bright, but to seek, in your measure, to be as wise as your Master
   was in His choice of Gethsemane as the scene of His solitary
   supplication and subsequent betrayal.

   II. Now, secondly, let us consider THE EXERCISE OF THE SAVIOR UPON THAT
   SPOT. Every item is worthy of attention and imitation.

   First, He took all the precautions for others. He left 8 of His
   disciples at the entrance to the Garden, saying to them, "Pray that you
   enter not into temptation." Then He took Peter, James and John a little
   further into the Garden, saying to them, "Tarry you here, and watch
   with Me." There ought, thus, to have been two watching and praying
   bands. If they had all been on the watch, they might have heard the
   footfalls of the approaching band and they would have seen in the
   distance the lights of the lanterns and torches of these who were
   coming to arrest their Lord. Probably our Master took these precautions
   more for the sake of His disciples than for His own sake. He bade them
   pray as well as watch, that they might not be taken unawares, nor be
   overcome with fear when they saw their Master captured and led away as
   a prisoner. From this action of our Lord, we may learn that we, also,
   in our own extremity, should not forget to care for others and shield
   them from harm as much as we can.

   Next, our Savior solicited the sympathy of friends. As a Man, He
   desired the prayers and sympathies of those who had been most closely
   associated with Him. Oh, what a Prayer Meeting they might have
   held--watching for the coming of the enemy and praying for their dear
   Lord and Master! They had a noble opportunity of showing their devotion
   to Him, but they missed it. They could not have kept Judas and the men
   who came with him away from their Lord, but they might have let their
   Master know when Judas was coming. It was almost the last service that
   any of them could have rendered to Him before He died for them--yet
   they failed to render it and left Him, in that dread hour of darkness--
   without even the slight consolation that human sympathy might have
   afforded Him. In our times of trial, we shall not do wrong if we
   imitate our Lord in this action of His--yet we need not be surprised
   if, like He, we find all human aid fail us in our hour of greatest
   need.

   Then, leaving all His disciples, and going away alone, Jesus prayed and
   wrestled with Godand, in our time of trouble, our resort must be to
   prayer. Restrain not prayer at any time, even when the sun shines
   brightly upon you, but be sure that you pray when the midnight darkness
   surrounds your spirit. Prayer is most needed in such an hour as that,
   so be not slack in it, but pour out your whole soul in earnest
   supplication to your God and say to yourself, "Now above all other
   times I must pray with the utmost intensity." For consider how Jesus
   prayed in Gethsemane.

   He adopted the lowliest posture and manner. He fell on His face and
   prayed, saying, O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from
   Me." What an extraordinary sight! The eternal Son of God had taken upon
   Himself our nature and there He lay as low as the very dust out of
   which our nature was originally formed! There He lay as low as the most
   unrighteous sinner or the most humble beggar can lie before God. Then
   He began to cry to His Father in plain and simple language, but oh,
   what force He put into the words He used! Thrice He pleaded with His
   Father, repeating the same petition--and Luke tells us that, "being in
   an agony He prayed more earnestly; and His sweat was, as it were, great
   drops of blood falling down to the ground." He was not only in an agony
   of suffering, but in an agony of prayer at the same time!

   But while our Lord's prayer in Gethsemane was thus earnest, intense and
   repeated, it was, at the same time, balanced with a ready acquiescence
   in His Father's will! "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will."
   So, suffering one, you whose spirit has sunk within you. You who are
   depressed and well-near distracted with grief, may the Holy Spirit help
   you to do what Jesus did--to pray, to pray alone, to pray with
   intensity, to pray with importunity, to pray even unto an agony--for
   this is the way in which you will prevail with God and be brought
   through your hour of darkness and grief. Believe not the devil when he
   tells you that your prayer is in vain! Let not your unbelief say, "The
   Lord has closed His ears against you." "Behold, the Lord's hand is not
   shortened, that it cannot save, neither His ears heavy, that they
   cannot hear." Yet mind that you also imitate your Lord's submission and
   resignation, for that is not acceptable prayer in which a man seeks to
   make his own will prevail over the will of God! That is presumption and
   rebellion--not the cry of a true child of God. You may beseech Him to
   grant your request, "if it is possible," but you may not go beyond
   that! You must still cry, with your Lord, "Nevertheless not as I will,
   but as You will."

   I have already reminded you that our Lord sought human sympathy while
   in Gethsemane, but I want again to refer to that fact so that we may
   learn the lessons it is intended to teach us. In our little griefs we
   often go to our fellow creatures, but not to God--that habit is apt to
   breed dependence upon man. But in our greatest griefs, we frequently go
   to God and feel as if we could not go to man! Now, although that may
   look like honoring God, there is a good deal of pride mixed with it.
   Our Lord Jesus Christ neither depended upon men nor yet renounced the
   sympathy of men. There were three of His disciples within call and
   eight more a little further away, but probably still within call. He
   prayed to His Father, yet He asked of His disciples such sympathy as
   they might have shown to Him. Still, He did not depend upon their
   sympathy for, when He did not get it, He went back to His praying to
   His Father! There are some who say that they will trust in God and use
   no means--others say that they will use the means, but they fall short
   in the matter of trusting God. I have read that one of Mahommed's
   followers came to him and said, "O prophet of God, I shall turn my
   camel loose, tonight, and trust it to providence." But Mahommed very
   wisely answered, "Tie your camel up as securely as you can--and then
   trust it to providence." There was sound common sense in that
   remark--and the principle underlying it can be applied to far weightier
   matters. I believe that I am following the example of my Lord when I
   say, "I trust in God so fully that if no man will sympathize with me,
   He, alone, will enable me to drink all that is in this cup that He has
   placed in my hand. Yet I love my fellow creatures so much that I desire
   to have their sympathy with me in my sorrow, although if they withhold
   it, I shall still place my sole dependence upon my God."

   When our Lord came to His disciples and found them sleeping instead of
   watching, you know how prompt He was to find an excuse for them--"The
   spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak." His rebuke of Peter was
   very gentle-- "'Simon, do you sleep? Could you not watch one hour?' Are
   you sleeping, you who so recently boasted that you would go with Me to
   prison and to death and that though all others should deny Me, you
   would not? Ah, Simon, you had better watch and pray, for you know not
   how soon temptation may assail you and cause you to fall most
   grievously." Yet Peter was included with the rest of the disciples in
   the excuse which their Lord made for the willing but weak sleepers who
   ought to have been watchers. What a lesson this is to us! We do not
   make half the excuses for one another that Jesus makes for us!
   Generally, we are so busy making excuses for ourselvesthat we quite
   forget to make excuses for others. It was not so with our Lord. Even in
   His own overwhelming trouble, no sharp or unkind word escaped from His
   lips! When we are very ill, you know how apt we are to be irritable to
   those about us. And if others do not sympathize with us as we think
   they should, we wonder what they can be made of to see us in such
   sorrow and not to express more grief on our ac-

   count! Yet there was our Master, all stained with His own blood, for
   His heart's floods had burst their banks and run all over Him in a gory
   torrent! But when He came to His disciples, they gave Him no kind word,
   no help, no sympathy, for they were all asleep. He knew that they were
   sleeping for sorrow, so their sleep was not caused by indifference to
   His grief, but by their sorrow at His sorrow. Their Master knew this,
   so He made such excuse for them as He could. And, Beloved, when we are
   suffering our much smaller sorrows, let us be ready to make excuses for
   others as our Lord did in His great ocean of suffering!

   III. Now, thirdly, let us consider THE TRIUMPH UPON THAT SPOT. It was a
   terrible battle that was waged in

   Gethsemane--we shall never be able to pronounce that word without
   thinking of our Lord's grief and agony--but it was a battle that He
   won, a conflict that ended in complete victory for Him!

   The victory consisted, first, in His perfect resignation. There was no
   rebellion in His heart against the will of the Father to whom He had so
   completely subjected Himself. But unreservedly He cried, "Not as I
   will, but as You will." No clarion blast, nor firing of cannons, nor
   waving of flags, nor acclamation of the multitudes ever announced such
   a victory as our Lord achieved in Gethsemane! He there won the victory
   over all the griefs that were upon Him and all the griefs that were
   soon to roll over Him like huge Atlantic billows! He there won the
   victory over death and even over the wrath of God which He was about to
   endure to the utmost for His people's sake! There is true courage,
   there is the highest heroism, there is the declaration of the
   Invincible Conqueror in that cry, "Not as I will, but as You will."

   With Christ's perfect resignation, there was also His strong resolve.
   He had undertaken the work of His people's redemption and He would go
   through with it until He could triumphantly say from the Cross, "It is
   finished!" A man can sometimes dash forward and do a deed of
   extraordinary daring, but it is the long-sustained agony that is the
   real test of courageous endurance. Christ's agony in Gethsemane was
   broken up into three periods of most intense wrestling in prayer--with
   brief intervals which could have given Him no relief as He turned in
   vain to the sleeping disciples for the sympathy that His true Human
   Nature needed in that hour of dreadful darkness! But, as He had before
   steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem though He well knew all
   that awaited Him there, He still kept His face set like a flint toward
   the great purpose for which He had come from Heaven to earth. It is the
   wear and tear of long-continued grief that has proved too much for many
   a truly heroic spirit, yet our Lord endured it to the end! And so He
   left us an example that we shall do well to follow.

   A part of our Savior's victory was that He obtained angelic help. Those
   prayers of His prevailed with His Father, "and there appeared an angel
   unto Him from Heaven, strengthening Him." I know not how he did it, but
   in some mysterious way the angel brought Him succor from on high. We do
   not know that angel's name and we do not need to know it--but somewhere
   among the bright spirits before the Throne of God there is the angel
   who strengthened Christ in Gethsemane. What a high honor for him! The
   disciples missed the opportunity that Christ put within their reach,
   but the angel gladly availed himself of the opportunity as soon as it
   was presented to him.

   Last of all, the victory of Christ was manifest in His majestic bearing
   towards His enemies. Calmly He rose and faced the hostile band. And
   when the traitor gave the appointed signal by which Jesus was to be
   recognized, He simply asked the searching personal question, "Judas, do
   you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?" How that enquiry must have cut
   the betrayer to the heart! When Jesus turned to those who had been sent
   to arrest Him and said to them, "Whom do you seek," He did not speak
   like a man whose soul was exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death. And
   when they answered Him, "Jesus of Nazareth," He said, "I Am," and at
   the very sound of that great Jehovah's name, "I Am," "they went
   backward and fell to the ground." There was a majestic flash of His
   Deity even in the hour of the abasement of His Humanity--and they fell
   prostrate before the God who had thus confessed that the name of
   Jehovah rightly belonged to Him! Then He went with them quietly and
   without the slightest resistance after He had shown His care for His
   disciples by saying--"If, therefore, you seek Me, let these go their
   way"--and after He had healed the ear of Malchus, which Peter had so
   rashly cut off! Then, all the while that Christ was before Annas and
   Caiaphas, and before Pilate and Herod, and right on to the last dread
   scene of all upon the Cross, He was calm and collected--and never again
   endured such tossing to and fro as He had passed through in Gethsemane!

   Well now, Beloved, if the Lord shall bring us into deep waters and
   cause us to pass through fiery trials--if His Spirit shall enable us to
   pray as Jesus did, we shall see something like the same result in our
   own experience! We shall rise up from our knees strengthened for all
   that lies before us and fitted to bear the Cross that our Lord may have
   ordained for us. In any case, our cup can never be as deep or as bitter
   as His was--there were in His cup some ingredients that never will be
   found in ours. The bitterness of sin was there, but He has taken that
   away for all who believe in Him. His Father's wrath was there, but He
   drank that all up and left not a single drop for any of His people. One
   of the martyrs, as he was on his way to the stake, was so supremely
   happy that a friend said to him, "Your Savior was full of sorrow when
   He agonized for you in Gethsemane." "Yes," replied the martyr, "and for
   that very reason I am so happy, for He bore all the sorrow for me." You
   need not fear to die, if you are a Christian, since Jesus died to put
   away your sin--and death is but the opening of your cage to let you
   fly, to build your happy nest on high! Therefore, fear not even the
   last enemy, which is Death. Besides, Christ could not have a Savior
   with Him to help Him in His agony, but you have His assurance that He
   will be with you! You shall not have merely an angel to strengthen you,
   but you shall have that great Angel of the Covenant to save and bless
   you even to the end!

   The most of this sermon does not belong to some of you, for you do not
   belong to Christ. O dear Friends, do not give sleep to your eyes or
   slumber to your eyelids till you belong to Him! As surely as you live,
   you will have sorrows at some time or other, you will have a bitter cup
   of which you must drink--and then what will you do if you have no
   Divine consolation in the trying hour? What will you do when you come
   to die if you have no Christ to make your pillow soft for you, no
   Savior to go with you through that dark valley? Oh, seek Him and He
   will be found of you, even now! The Lord help you to do so, for
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN10.1-30.

   Verse 1. Verily, verity, I say unto you, he that enters not by the door
   into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief
   and a robber The positiveness of our Lord's teaching is noteworthy.
   Whatever may be said about dogmatically teaching, now, it is certain
   that His teaching is of that character! He does not raise questions,
   but He solves them. He does not suggest probabilities, but He declares
   certainties. This might be taken as the key-word to all the Savior's
   teaching, "Verily, verily." He makes a strong statement. He speaks as
   one having authority, not as the scribes who only claimed to have
   authority, but as the Sent One of the Father who really has it!
   "Verily, verily, I say unto you." Whatever comes to us with the
   imprimatur of the, "Verily, verily," of the Son of God is not to be
   questioned or doubted by us for a single moment! "He that enters not by
   the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is
   a thief and a robber." Christ Himself entered by the door. He came
   according to the ancient types, symbols and prophecies. He came as God
   said that He would come. He entered by the door. There is no
   irregularity about Christ's office as the Shepherd of His sheep. It is
   confirmed to Him by the sanction of the Holy Spirit. The witness of the
   Father is borne to Him--"This is My Beloved Son in whom I am well
   pleased: hear you Him." We rejoice to think that Jesus our Savior is
   also Christ the Anointed. He is Jesus to us, but He is the Anointed of
   the Father. He comes by right as the appointed Shepherd of the sheep
   entering in by the door!

   2, 3. But he who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To
   him the porter opens. To Him John the Baptist, as the porter, opened
   the door. He pointed to Him and said, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes
   away the sin of the world." And every God-sent minister is a porter to
   Christ, opening the door to Him! That is our office--to stand and open
   the door that Christ may come forth among you--and that you may come in
   to Him and find the spiritual pasture on which your souls can feed. "To
   him the porter opens"--

   3. And the sheep hear his voice. Those who are really chosen of God
   hear and heed the voice of Christ but those who are not Christ's chosen
   ones will not heed His discourse, but will listen to the many voices
   which attract the ears and the hearts of sinful men. The elect of God
   are known by this mark--that they hear the voice of Christ! Just as you
   can find out in a heap of ashes, whether there are any pieces of steel
   there by simply thrusting in a magnet, so can you find out God's chosen
   people by the mighty magnet of Christ's voice!

   3. And he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. [See Sermon
   #2359, Volume 40--personal and effectual calling.] Sometimes He leads
   them out from the midst of the world's

   flocks. And sometimes He calls them by name when they are in His fold
   and leads them out to even higher and better pastures, calls them and
   leads them out to higher Truths of God than they have before received.

   4. And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them. Christ
   never drives His sheep, He leads them. As the Eastern shepherd always
   goes before his sheep, so does the Savior go before His flock. "He goes
   before them"--

   4. And the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. Christ's sheep
   are marked in various ways. They are marked on the foot--"the sheep
   follow Him." And they are marked in the ear, "for they know His voice."
   They follow the track of their Shepherd and they give heed to the voice
   of their Shepherd--and by these tokens they are known to be His sheep.

   5. And a stranger they will not follow. There are strangers constantly
   coming into our different churches. We know they are strangers, for
   they preach strange doctrines and do not keep to the old paths. Those
   that are notChrist's sheep follow them directly. "Here is a very clever
   man," they say, and off they go after him! But of God's elect it is
   written, "A stranger they will not follow"--

   5. But will flee from him. They are frightened at the very sight of
   him! They cannot tell what deadly pasture he is preparing for them, so
   they "flee from him"--

   5. For they know not the voice of strangers. They know the voice of
   their Shepherd, but they know not the voice of strangers, so they flee
   from them.

   6. This parable spoke Jesus unto them but they did not understand the
   things He spoke unto them. They thus proved that they were not His
   sheep, for they did not understand His words!

   7. 8. Then Jesus said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   I am the door of the sheep. And all who came before Me are thieves and
   robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. There were many false christs
   that rose up before Jesus Christ appeared--and there were many persons
   who followed those false christs. "But the sheep did not hear them."
   They still waited with holy Anna, with patient Simeon and the rest of
   the faithful who waited for the appearing of the true Shepherd, and
   were not misled by the pretenders who were only "thieves and robbers."

   9. Iam the Door. If anyone enters by Me, he shall be saved, and' shall
   go in and out, and find pasture."^ Sermon #2752,

   Volume 47--THE DOOR.] Christ is the Door just as truly as He is the

   Shepherd and as He is everything that is necessary and good for His
   people! If I come to Christ, I must come to Him by Christ. Any of us
   who will but enter in by Christ, who is the Door of His Church, shall
   find salvation and more than that--we shall find liberty--for we "shall
   go in and out." Our daily pathway shall be a safe one and we shall have
   abundant supplies for all our daily needs. We "shall go in and out and
   find pasture."

   10. The thiefcomes not but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: Iam
   come that they might have life, and that they

   might have it more abundantly. [See Sermon #1150, Volume 20--LIFE MORE
   ABUNDANT.] I trust that the first purpose of Christ's coming has been
   fulfilled to many of us, for we "have life" through Him--but ought we
   not to be encouraged to hope that we may reach a higher standard of
   that life--and so have it more abundantly? We do not want to have just
   enough life to enable us to breathe, but we want life enough for
   usefulness, for joy, for triumph, for likeness to Christ, for communion
   with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ!

   11-13. Iam the Good Shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the
   sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
   sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees:
   and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep. The hireling flees,
   because he is an hireling, and cares not for the sheep. Christ is the
   Good Shepherd and, therefore, He never fled as the hireling flees. He
   cared for the sheep, for they were His own. The wolf might come, but
   the Good Shepherd was ready to meet him. He would not have His sheep
   scattered, but He would gather them in the cloudy and dark day, and in
   every time of danger He would be the center around which they might
   rally.

   14, 15. I am the Good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of
   Mine. As the Father knows Me, even so I

   know the Father: and I lay down My life for the sheep. [See Sermon
   #1877, Volume 32--OUR OWN DEAR SHEPHERD.] Our translators have ruined
   this passage by putting a full stop where there should not be one, and
   by breaking it into two verses. It should run thus--"I am the Good
   Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine as the Father knows
   Me and I know the Father: and I lay down My life for the sheep." Christ
   here sets forth the intimate knowledge that there is between Himself
   and all His people--as much as there is between the Father and the Son!
   It is wonderful teaching, full of depth and spiritual power. As the
   Father knows the Son, and the Son knows the Father, so certainly does
   Christ know His Church--and His Church knows Him--or shall do so in the
   future.

   16. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold. [See Sermon
   #1713, Volume 29--OTHER SHEEP AND ONE FLOCK.] They are of this flock,
   but they are not of this fold. The flock is divided,

   and lies down in different fields for the present--"Other sheep I have,
   which are not of this fold"--

   16-18. Them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice; and there
   shall be one fold, and one Shepherd. Therefore does My Father love Me,
   because I lay down My life, that I might take it again. No man takes it
   from Me, but I lay it down ofMyself 'Christ's death was to be the act
   of His own free will, as well as of the violence of wicked men.

   18-21. Ihavepower to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
   This commandment have Ireceived ofMy Father. There was a division,
   therefore, again among the Jews for these sayings. And many of them
   said, He has a devil, and is mad, why listen to Him? Others said, These
   are not the words of one that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of
   the blind?'Christ's sayings always cause a division between those who
   hear them. There must always be two opinions, just as there are some
   who are His sheep and some who are not. When you go and try to speak
   for Christ, do not be at all astonished if people ridicule you. What
   did they say of the Master, Himself? "He has a devil, and is mad." They
   will not say anything worse than that of you. And when they have said
   it, what does it matter? Hard words break no bones. So have courage
   enough to bear opposition and you may, like your Master, yet find some
   who will defend you--for there may be those who will say--"These are
   not the words of one that has a devil."

   22-26. And it was at Jerusalem the Feast of Dedication, and it was
   winter. And Jesus talked in the Temple in Solo-mon'sporch. Then came
   the Jews roundabout Him and said to Him, How long do You make us to
   doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered them, I
   told you and you didn't believe Me: the works that I do in My Father's
   name, they bear witness of Me. But you believe not because you are not
   ofMy sheep, as I said unto you. "You are not My chosen people--there
   has been no work of Divine Grace in your hearts and, therefore, you do
   not believe." What a brave way that was of putting the Truth of God!
   Some would have said, "Because you do not believe, you are not my
   sheep;" but Jesus puts it the other way, "Because you are not My sheep,
   therefore you do not believe."

   27-30. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me: and
   I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither
   shall any man pluck them out ofMy hand. My Father, who gave them to Me,
   is greater than all; andno man is able to pluck them out ofMy Father's
   hand. IandMy Father are One. [See Sermon #2120, Volume 35--the security
   OF BELIEVERS--OR, SHEEP WHO WILL NEVER PERISH.] This great

   Truth of God angered the Jews so much that they "took up stones again
   to stone Him." They proved, by thus treating the Good Shepherd, that
   they were not His sheep!

The True Aim of Preaching

   (No. 3191)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Be it known unto you, therefore, brethren, that through this Man is
   preached unto you the forgiveness of sins." Acts 13:38.

   PAUL'S mode of preaching, as illustrated by this chapter, was first of
   all to appeal to the understanding with a clear exposition of doctrinal
   Truths of God and then to impress those Truths upon the emotions of his
   hearers with earnest and forcible exhortations. This is an excellent
   model for revivalists. They must not give exhortation without Doctrine,
   for if so, they will be like men who are content with burning powder in
   their guns, but have omitted the shot! It is the Doctrine we preach,
   the Truth we deliver which God will make a power to bless men. However
   earnest and zealous we may be in speaking, if we have not something
   weighty and solid to say, we shall appear to be earnest about nothing
   and shall not be at all likely to create a lasting impression. Paul, if
   you notice through this chapter, first of all gives the history of
   Redemption, tells the story of the Cross, insists upon the Resurrection
   of the Savior and then he comes to close and personal dealings with the
   souls of men and bids them not neglect this great salvation!

   At the same time, it was not all Doctrine and no exhortation but,
   whenever Paul wound up his discourse and left the synagogue, he made a
   strenuous, pointed, personal appeal to those who had listened to him!
   Let such of our brethren as are passionately fond of mere Doctrine--but
   having little of the marrow of Divine Mercy or the milk of human
   kindness in their souls, do not care to have the Word pressed upon the
   consciences of men--let them stand rebuked by the example of the
   Apostle Paul! He knew well that even the Truth of God, itself, would be
   powerless unless it is applied. Like the wheat in the basket, it can
   produce no harvest till it is sown broadcast in the furrows. We cannot
   expect that men will come and make an application of the Truth of God
   to themselves. We must, having our heart glowing and our souls on fire
   with love to them, seek to bring the Truth to bear upon them, to
   impress it upon their hearts and consciences as in the sight of God and
   in the place of Christ.

   The subject to which Paul drew attention--the target at which he was
   shooting all his arrows--was forgiveness of sins through the Man,
   Christ Jesus. That is my subject tonight. And when I have spoken upon
   it briefly, I shall then have a few words to say about his audience and
   what became of them.

   I. PAUL'S SUBJECT was superlative--the Subject of subjects--the great
   master Doctrine of the Christian ministry--"Be itknown unto you,
   therefore, brethren, that through this Man ispreached unto you the
   forgiveness ofsins."

   "The forgiveness of sins" is a topic which will be more or less
   interesting to every hearer here in proportion as he feels that he has
   committed sins, the guilt of which appalls his conscience. To those
   good people among you who fold your arms and say, "We have done no
   wrong either to God or man," I have nothing to say. You need no
   physician, for you are not sick. You, evidently, would not be thankful
   for the heavenly eye-salve, for you are not blind. The wealth that
   Christ can bring you will not induce you to bow the knee to Him, for
   already you think yourselves to be rich and increased in goods. But I
   shall be quite sure of the ears of the man whose sins have been a
   burden to him. If there is one here who needs to be reconciled to God,
   who says with the prodigal, "I will arise and go to my Father," I shall
   not need to study how to fit my words--let them come out as they may,
   the theme, itself, will be sure to enlist the attention of such an one
   who says--

   "How can I get my sins forgiven? How can I find my way to Heaven?"

   While we attempt to tell him that, we shall ensure his attention. This
   is our aim--and this we will do if God permits.

   The Christian minister tells men the ground of pardon, the exclusive
   method, (for there is a monopoly in this matter)--the exclusive method
   by which God will pardon sin. "Through this Man," says the text. That
   is to say, God will pardon, but He will only pardon in one way--through
   His Son Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus has a monopoly on mercy! If you
   will depend upon the uncovenanted mercy of God--the mercy of God apart
   from Christ--you shall find that you have depended upon a reed and
   built your house upon sand! Into the one silver pipe of the atoning
   Sacrifice, God has made to flow the full current of pardoning Grace. If
   you will not go to that--you may be tempted by the mirage, you may
   think that you can drink there to the fullest, but you shall die
   disappointed. You must die unless you come for salvation to Christ!
   What does He say, Himself? "I am the Door: by Me if any man enters in,
   he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture." He that
   believes on the Son of God is not condemned! But he that believes
   not--may he go right, too? No, he is already condemned because he
   believes not! "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." These
   are Christ's own words, not mine! He that believes shall be saved, "but
   he that believes not shall be"--what? Pardoned for his unbelief? No,
   he--"shall be damned!"There is no other alternative. The expression
   might seem harsh if I were the inventor of it, but as it came from the
   lips of Christ who was the gentlest, meekest and most tender of men,
   God forbid that I should make up a charity of which the Lord, Himself,
   made no profession! "He that believes not shall be damned." God
   presents mercy to the sons of men, but He has chosen to present it in
   only one channel--through that Man who died for sinners, the Just for
   the unjust, that He might bring them to God!

   Why is it that forgiveness comes to us only through Jesus Christ? The
   whole economy of Redemption supplies us with an answer. The Man Christ
   Jesus is a Divine Person. He is the Son of God. You will never doubt
   that reconciliation is an effect of Infinite Wisdom if you once clearly
   understand the condition that made it requisite. Though His people were
   objects of God's everlasting love, their sins had kindled His fierce
   anger as if it were an unquenchable fire. Inasmuch as God is just, He
   must from the necessity of His Nature, punish sin! Yet He willed to
   have mercy upon the fallen sons of men. Therefore it was that Christ
   came into this world. Being God, He was made Man for our sakes. He
   suffered from the wrath of God that which we, the offending sinners,
   ought to have suffered. God exacted from the Man, Christ Jesus, that
   which He would otherwise have exacted from us! Upon Christ's dear
   devoted head was laid the curse. Upon His bare back fell the scourge
   that would have tortured our souls throughout eternity! Those hands of
   His, when nailed to the tree, smarted with our smart. That heart bled
   with our bleeding. "The chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and
   with His stripes we are healed; surely He has borne our griefs and
   carried our sorrows." Substitution, then, is the cause of it all! God
   will forgive sin because the sin which He forgives has been already
   atoned for by the sufferings of His dear Son!

   You know, many of you, the story, in old Roman history, of the young
   man who had violated discipline and was condemned to die. But his elder
   brother, a grand old soldier who had often been to the front in the
   battles of his country, came and exposed his chest, showed his many
   scars and exhibited his body covered with the orders, insignias and
   honors of his victories. And then he said, "I cannot ask life for my
   brother on account of anything that he has ever done for his country.
   He deserves to die, I know, but I set my scars and my wounds before you
   as the price for his life. And I ask you whether you will not spare him
   for his brother's sake." And with acclamation, it was carried that for
   his brother's sake he should live. Sinner, this is what Christ does for
   you! He points to His scars. He pleads before the Throne of God, "I
   have suffered the vengeance due to sin. I have honored Your righteous
   Law--for My sake have mercy upon that unworthy brother of Mine!" In
   this way, and in no other way, is forgiveness of sins preached to you
   through this Man, Christ Jesus!

   It is our business to also preach to you the instrument through which
   you may obtain this pardon. We read the question in your anxious eyes,
   "I can understand that Christ, having stood as a Substitute, has
   received from God power to pardon human souls, but how can I obtain the
   benefit, how can I draw near to Him?" Did you ever read that Moses
   described the righteousness of faith--and Paul endorsed his
   description? "Say not in your heart, who shall ascend into Heaven, or
   who shall descend into the deep?" You have no reason to climb so high
   or dive so low. "The Word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart;
   that is, the Word of faith which we preach." You have no need to go
   home to get at Christ! You have no need to even come here to find Him!
   He is accessible at all hours and in all places--the ever-present Son
   of God." But how shall I come to Him?" asks one. Oh, you need not
   torture your body! You need not afflict your soul! You need not bring
   your gold and silver--you need not even bring your tears! All that you
   have to do is to come to Him as you are and trust in Him! Oh, if you
   will believe that He is the Son of God and is able to save to the ut-

   termost--and if you will cast yourself upon Him with your whole
   weight--falling upon Him, leaning upon Him, resting upon Him with that
   whole trust which needs and lacks no other support, you shall be saved!
   Now cling to the Cross, you shipwrecked Sinner, and you shall never go
   down while clinging to that! If you are enabled by the Holy Spirit to
   put your sole and simple reliance upon Christ, earth's pillars may
   totter and the lamps of Heaven be extinguished, but you shall never
   perish, neither shall any pluck you out of Christ's hands! Trust
   Jesus--that is the way of salvation! "What?" asks one, "If I trust
   Christ tonight, shall I have my sins forgiven?" Yes, forgiven tonight!
   "What? If I just rest in Christ and look to Him?" Even so! "Your faith
   has saved you. Go in peace."--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One, There is life at this
   moment for thee! Then look, Sinner, look unto Him and be saved-- Unto
   Him who was nailed to the tree!" You will be saved, not by repenting
   and tears! Not by wailing and works! Not by doing and praying, but
   coming, believing, simply depending upon what Jesus Christ has done!
   When your soul says by faith what Christ said in fact, "It is
   finished," you are saved and you may go your way rejoicing!

   We have thus preached God's way of pardon and man's way of getting at
   God's pardon. But we are also enjoined to preach about the character of
   this forgiveness of sin. Never had messengers such happy tidings to
   deliver! When God pardons a man's sins, He pardons all of them--He
   makes a clean sweep of the whole! God never pardons half a man's sins
   and leaves the rest in His Book of Remembrance. He has pardon for all
   sins at once! I believe that, virtually, before God, all the sins of
   the Believer were so laid to the account of Christ that no sins ever
   can be laid to the Believer's door. The Apostle does not say, "Who does
   lay anything to the charge of God's elects," but, "Who shall?" as
   though nobody ever could! I am inclined to think that Kent's words are
   literally true--

   "Here'spardon for transgressions past-- It matters not how black their
   cast! And oh, my Soul, with wonder view, For sins to come, here's
   pardon too!" It is a full pardon. God takes His pen and writes a
   receipt. Though the debt may be a hundred talents, He can write it off!
   Or be it ten thousand, the same hand can receipt it! Luther tells us of
   the devil appearing to him in a dream and bringing before him the long
   rolls of his sins. And when he brought them, Luther said, "Now write at
   the bottom, 'the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses us from all
   sin!'" Oh, that blessed word, "all"--"from all sin!" Great sins and
   little sins! Sins of our youth and sins of our gray hairs! Sins by
   night and sins by day! Sins of action and sins of thought-- they are
   ALL gone! Blessed Savior! Precious blood! Omnipotent Redeemer! Mighty
   Red Sea, that thus drowns every Egyptian!

   It is a full pardon and it is, likewise, a free pardon. God never
   pardons any sinner from any other motive than His own pure Grace. It is
   all gratis! It cost the Savior much, but it costs us nothing! It is a
   pardon freely given by a God of Grace because He delights in mercy.

   There is, too, this further blessing about it, that while it is full
   and free, it is also irresistible Whom God pardons, He never condemns.
   Let Him once say, "Absolvo te," "I absolve you," and none can lay
   anything to our charge! We have heard of men who have been pardoned for
   one offense, but who have committed another--and have, therefore, had
   to die. But when the Lord pardons us, He prevents our going away to our
   old corruption. He puts His Spirit in us and makes new men of us so
   that we find we cannot do what we used to do! That mighty Grace of God
   is without repentance! God never repents of having bestowed His Grace.
   Do not believe those who tell you that He loves you, today, and hates
   you tomorrow! O Beloved--once in Christ the devil cannot get you out of
   Him! Get into the sacred clefts, Sinner, of that Rock of Ages which was
   cleft for you, and out of it the fiends of Hell can never drag you! You
   are safe when once you get into that harbor. Get Christ and you have
   Heaven!

   All things are yours when Christ is yours--full pardon, free pardon and
   everlasting pardon! And let me also tell you, present pardon. It is a
   notion still current that you cannot know you are forgiven till you
   come to die. O Beloved, when people talk thus, it shows what they know,
   or rather, what they do notknow about it. There are some here who can

   bear witness--no, there are millions of God's people who, if they could
   speak from Heaven, would tell you that they knew their pardon long
   years before they entered into rest.

   If you had ever been shut up in prison, as some of us were, and had
   been set at liberty, you would know what present pardon is. Five long
   years it was with me a bitter agony of soul when nothing but Hell
   stared me in the face--when neither night nor day had I peace, and oh,
   what joy it was when I heard that precious Truth of God, "Look unto Me,
   and be you saved, all the ends of the earth." I felt the pardon really
   fall on me! I was as conscious of pardon as this hand is conscious of
   being clean after I have washed it--and as conscious of being accepted
   in Christ, at that moment, as I am now sure that I am able to stand
   here and say as much with my mouth! A man may have this Infallible
   Witness of the Holy Spirit! I know that to some stubborn minds, it will
   always seem as fanaticism, but what do I care whether it seems as
   fanaticism to them or not, as long as it is real to my heart? We count
   ourselves as honest as others and have as much right to be
   believed--whether they credit our sanity and our sincerity or not does
   not affect us a straw, as long as we know that we have received the
   Grace! If you reckoned a clear profit of ten thousand pounds upon some
   speculation and somebody said to you, "It is all foolery"--the proof
   would be unanswerable if you had received the amount and had the bank
   notes in your house. Then you would say, "Ah, you may think as you like
   about it, but I have got the cash." So Christians can say, "Being
   justified by faith, we have peace with God...and not only so, but we
   also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now
   received the Atonement."

   When someone tells a Christian that he is not forgiven, he says, "Oh,
   you may say what you like about it, but I have the witness within that
   I am born of God. I am not what I used to be--if I were to meet myself
   in the street, I would hardly know myself, I mean my spiritualself--my
   inner self--for I am so changed, so renewed, so turned upside down that
   I am not what I was! I am a new man in Christ Jesus." The man who can
   say this can bear to be laughed at. He knows what he is doing and at
   the coolest and most sober moment of his life, even when lying on his
   bed sick and ready to die, he can look right into eternity, soberly
   judge of Christ, and find Him to be worthy of his confidence and,
   thinking of the blood-washing, find it to be a real fact! There are a
   thousand things in this world that look well enough till you come to
   look upon them in the prospect of the grave--but this is a thing that
   looks better, the nearer we get to eternity and the more solemnly and
   deliberately we take our account of it in the sight of God!

   Oh, yes, there is a present pardon! But what I want to say most
   emphatically is that there is a present pardon for you. "Who is that?"
   you ask. Oh, I am not going to pick and choose from the midst of you.
   Whoever among you will come and trust Christ, there is present pardon
   for you! What? That gray-headed man there, 70 years old in sin? Yes,
   blessed be the name of the Lord, if he this night should rest in
   Christ, there is instantaneous pardon for him! Is there a harlot here?
   Is there a drunk here? Is there one here who has cursed God? Is there
   one here who has been dishonest? Is there one here over whom all these
   sins have rolled? Why, if you believe, your sins, which are many, are
   all forgiven you! And though there should be brought before us one so
   guilty that we might well stay away from him, yet if he can but trust
   Christ, Christ will not stay away from him, but will receive him! Oh,
   was not that a wonderful moment when the Savior wrote on the ground as
   the woman taken in adultery stood before Him--when all her accusers,
   being convicted by their own consciences, went out, leaving the sinner
   and the Savior alone together--and when Jesus Christ, who hated all
   kinds of sin, but who loved all kinds of sinners, lifted Himself up and
   said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more"? Ah, poor Sinner,
   Jesus Christ does not condemn you! If you condemn yourselves, He will
   never condemn you. He will only condemn your sin, for that is what He
   hates, but He does not hate you. If you and your sins part, Christ and
   you shall never part! If you will but trust Him right now, you shall
   find Him able to save you even to the very uttermost from all these
   sins of yours which have become your plague and your burden! God help
   you, then, to trust Him at once and to find this present pardon--this
   pardon which will last you forever--and which you may have right now!

   Now, as I said before, all this will be good news only to those who
   want pardon, but not to those who do not require it. I have nothing to
   say to those who do not want it. Why should I? They that are whole have
   no need of the physician, but they that are sick." God will have
   something to say to you one of these days. I recollect and I hope you
   have not forgotten the story of the rich man. It is more than allegory,
   it is fact. You know that while he was in this world, he had fared
   sumptuously every day. He was clothed in purple and fine linen and as
   for God's child Lazarus, he thought he was a poor miserable beggar,
   only fit to be with the dogs--and he despised him. He looked at him and
   said, "Oh, I am a gentleman. I am dressed in purple and fine linen. I
   am none of your beggarly saints lying on the dunghill, though they call

   themselves saints, and all that. I am rich." Now it so happened that he
   did not see himself--he had scales over his eyes. But he found out the
   Truth of God one day. You remember Christ's words, "In Hell, he lifted
   up his eyes!" Ah, and he saw, then, what he had never seen before! All
   that he had ever seen before had been a glamour over his eyes--he had
   been dazed and benighted. Hehad been the beggar, all the while, if he
   had but known it! While Lazarus, who had won the beggars garb, was
   waited on like a prince and carried by angels into Abraham's bosom. So,
   the poor beggar, covered with wounds and sores, who thinks he is only
   fit for the dunghill--he is the man Christ will save! He is the man
   Christ will take up to Heaven at last! As for your self-righteous men
   who think themselves so good and excellent, they will be like the
   tinsel and the gilt--and will all be burned up in the fire--the varnish
   and paint will all come off! God will knock the masks off their faces
   and let the leprosy that was on their brow be seen by all men. But,
   Sinner, you who are such, and who know it--unto you is preached this
   night forgiveness of sins through the Man, Christ Jesus!

   II. We shall now proceed to remind you of THE CONGREGATION TO WHICH
   PAUL ADDRESSED HIMSELF, AND WHAT BECAME OF THEM.

   The text says, "Unto you is preached forgiveness of sins." Never mind
   the Jews and Gentiles Paul preached to--the verse is quite as
   applicable here as it was there. " Unto you is preached the forgiveness
   of sins." My dear Friend, it is no small privilege to be where the
   message of the forgiveness of sins can yet be heard. Unto you i s
   preached the forgiveness of sins, but not to the tens of thousands and
   millions who have gone the way of all flesh, unpardoned and unsaved!
   How is it that you are spared? Your brother is dead. Your children
   have, some of them, died--but you are spared. You have been at sea. You
   have been in peril. You have had the fever. You have been near death
   and yet here you are, kept alive, with death so near! Is not this a
   privilege that unto you is preached the forgiveness of sins? What would
   they give to hear it once more? What would they give to have another
   opportunity? But it has been said of them--

   "Too late, too late! You cannot enter now."

   "Unto you is preached the forgiveness of sins." I said that this was a
   privilege, but it is a privilege which some of you have despised. Those
   who heard Paul had never heard the Gospel before--many of you have
   heard it from your youth up. Alas, I cannot help saying of some of you
   that I already to despair of your conversion! You do not improve. All
   the exhortations in the world are to you as if they were spoken to an
   iron column or to a brazen wall! Why will you die? What shall be done
   to you? What shall be said to you? Unto you is preached the forgiveness
   of sins. When you die, careless, Christless, unsaved--when we throw
   that handful of dirt upon your coffin, we shall have to think, "Ah,
   that man is lost, and yet unto him was preached the forgiveness of
   sins!"

   Well, but it is still preached to you! Notwithstanding that you have
   neglected the privilege, the Gospel is still preached to you! Gladly
   would I point my finger at some of you and say, "Well, now, I really do
   mean you, personally. You people under the gallery whom I cannot see
   and you upstairs, here, everyone of you--unto you is preached the
   forgiveness of sins! God has not sent us, tonight, to preach to your
   neighbors, but to you--you Mary, Thomas, George, John, Sarah--you, you
   personally--unto you is preached the forgiveness of sins and it is with
   you, now, tonight, to consider what reception shall be given to the
   message of mercy! Shall a hard heart be the only answer? Oh, may the
   Spirit of God come upon you and give instead thereof a quickened
   conscience and a tender heart that you may be led to say, "God be
   merciful to me a sinner!"

   Do you ask, " What became of those to whom the Word was preached with
   such thriiling earnestness?"

   Some of them raved at a very great rate. If you read through the
   Chapter, you will find that the Jews were filled with envy and they
   spoke against those things that were declared to them by Paul,
   contradicting and blaspheming, and so on, until Paul shook the dust off
   his feet against them and went his way. But there was another class.
   The 48th verse says, "When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and
   glorified the Word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal
   life believed.''" Ah, that is the comfort! There are some, whenever the
   Gospel is preached, who do not like it. A person was once very angry
   with me because in preaching on the natural depravity of man, I had
   charged man with being depraved and I had said that man was proud. The
   man would not confess it and there he was--proving the truth of the
   assertion regarding himself that he was proud, because he could not
   bear to hear the truth told him about it! If he had said he was proud,
   I would have thought I had made a mistake, but when he bridled up and
   got into an angry temper, I knew that God had sent me to tell him His
   Truth. Outspoken Truths of God makes half the world angry! The Light of
   God blinds their eyes!

   When the Jews kicked against Paul's preaching, did Paul feel
   disappointed? Oh no, or if he did feel depressed for a moment, there
   was a strong cordial at hand--that very cordial by reason of which
   Jesus rejoiced in spirit as He saw the goodwill of the Father in
   revealing unto babes those things that are hidden from the wise and
   prudent! Here was Paul's comfort--there were some upon whom there had
   been a blessed work! There were some whose names were written in the
   Book of Life! Some concerning whom there had been Covenant
   transactions! Some whom God had chosen from before the foundation of
   the world! Some whom Christ had bought with His blood and whom the
   Spirit, therefore, came to claim as God's own property because Christ
   had bought them upon the bloody tree--and those "some" believed!
   Naturally they were like others, but Grace made the distinction and
   faith was the sign and evidence of that distinction!

   Now, you need not ask tonight whether you are God's elect. I ask
   another question--Do you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ? If you do,
   you are His elect--if you do not, the question is not to be decided by
   us yet. If you are God's chosen ones, you will know it by your trusting
   in Jesus. Simple as that trust is, it is the Infallible proof of
   Election! God never sets the brand of faith upon a soul whom Christ has
   not bought with His blood. And if you believe, all eternity is yours!
   Your name is in God's Book, you are a favored one of Heaven, the Divine
   decrees all point to you--go your way and rejoice!

   But if you believe not, you are in the gall of bitterness and in the
   bonds of iniquity. May eternal mercy bring you out of that state, yes,
   bring you out of it tonight! Oh, that I had the time and power to plead
   with some here who know that Christ died, who know that He can save,
   who know the Gospel--but who still do not trust in that Gospel for
   their salvation! Oh, may you be led to do it and to do it now, before
   this day is over! We want and pray for the conversion of many more
   beside you. If we had these souls given to us, what a token for good
   would it be, and what a comfort! May the Lord bring you in, and bring
   you in tonight! Oh, trust Him, Soul, trust Him! May God help you to
   trust Him, and His shall be the praise, world without end!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE24.

   Verses 1-11. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the
   morning, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had
   prepared, and certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled
   away from the sepulcher And they entered in and found not the body of
   the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed
   thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: and as
   they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, theysaid to
   them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?He is not here, but is
   risen. [See Sermon #1106, Volume 19--

   "THE LORD IS RISEN, INDEED."] Remember how He spoke to you

   when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of Man must be delivered
   into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise
   again. And they remembered His words, and returned to the sepulcher,
   and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest It was
   Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other
   women that were with them, which told these things unto the Apostles.
   And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them
   not What an emptying power unbelief has! No news could ever be more
   full of solace than the news of a risen Savior! But to the ears of
   unbelief, this news, which made all Heaven glad, seemed to the Apostles
   but as idle tales! Unbelief tied the hands of Jesus once when he was at
   Nazareth for, "He did not many mighty works there because of their
   unbelief." And unbelief seems often to tie our heart-strings, too, so
   that they can give forth no sweet music! O Lord, help us to overcome
   our unbelief and enable us to always confidently believe the Truth that
   comes to us supported by such testimony as these good women gave to the
   Apostles!

   12-14. Then arose Peter, and ran to the sepulcher; and stooping down,
   he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering
   in himself at that which was come to pass. And, behold, two of them
   went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem
   about three score furlongs. And they talked together of all these
   things which had happened.As was most proper, they that feared the Lord
   spoke often, one to another. Just as Elijah and Elisha talked with each
   other as they went towards the Jordan where Elijah was to be
   translated, so these two disciples were talking together of the great
   events that had recently happened--and especially talking of the death
   and the reported Resurrection of Christ. This was most natural, for
   what is uppermost in the heart will soon be uppermost upon

   the tongue. They had had their minds greatly exercised concerning the
   departure of their Lord and it was only natural that they should speak
   of it. If we never talk of Christ, we have great reason to suspect
   whether He is really in our hearts at all. Christ's declaration to His
   disciples, "Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there
   am I in the midst of them," was literally fulfilled in the case of
   these two disciples going to Emmaus!

   15. And it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned,
   Jesus, Himself drew near and went with the . And, Beloved, if you would
   have communion with Christ, have communion with one another! If my Lord
   will not reveal Himself to me, perhaps He will reveal Himself to
   others--therefore let me get into the company of His chosen and then,
   surely, when He appears in the midst of their assembly, I shall have a
   share of the fellowship that they will enjoy!

   16-19. But their eyes were restrained that they should not know Him.
   [See Sermon #1180, Volume 20--jesus near but unrecognized.] And He said
   to them, What kind of conversation is

   this that you are having with one another as you walk and are sad? And
   the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to Him, Are You
   a stranger in Jerusalem and have not known the things which are come to
   pass in these days? And He said to them, What things? And they said to
   Him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet mighty in deed
   and word before God and all the people. What little advance these
   disciples had made in the knowledge of Christ! He had been their
   Teacher. They had seen His miracles and yet, though they had been
   constantly under His superintendence, they had not learned enough to
   know that He was Divine! The Holy Spirit had not yet been given and,
   without the Holy Spirit's Divine instruction, these disciples could
   only say that Christ "was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God
   and all the people."

   20-25. And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be
   condemned to death, and have crucified Him. But we trusted that it had
   been He which should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, today
   is the third day since these things were done. Yes, and certain woman
   of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulcher;
   and when they found not His body, they came, saying that they had also
   seen a vision of angels, which said that He was alive. And certain of
   them which were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as
   the women had said: but they didnot see Him. Then He said to them, O
   fools, andslow ofheart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken.
   [See Sermon

   #1980, Volume 33--FOLLY OF UNBELIEF.] Supposing Him to be a stranger in
   Jerusalem, yet one who was well acquainted with Jewish prophecy, they
   had told Him exactly what the prophecies had foretold concerning the
   Messiah! If they had meant to refer to the various prophecies
   concerning Christ, they could not have detailed facts which would have
   more accurately fulfilled them and, therefore, Christ said to them "O
   fools, how slow of heart you are to believe all that the Prophets have
   spoken!"

   26. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things."Are not those just
   the very things which the Prophets said that the Christ, the Anointed,
   must suffer? 'Ought not Christ to have suffered these things'"--

   26-28. And to enter into His glory? And beginning at Moses and all the
   Prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the thing
   concerning Himself And they drew near unto the village, where they
   went: and He made as though He would have gone further For Christ never
   forces His company upon anyone. And if we are willing to let Him go, He
   will go--nor will He return until we are heartily sick of having
   treated Him coldly. When we can no longer bear the absence of Christ,
   then He will speedily return to us. There is an instance of this in the
   life of Christmas Evans which impressed me very much when I read it.
   Sandemanianism had spread very much through Wales and he had been very
   busy attacking it. But it seemed as if, in doing so, his sermons had
   lost all their former power and unction--and his own soul also grew
   very dry and barren--he had little or no fellowship with Christ. He
   said that, at last, his soul grew utterly weary of being absent from
   his Lord and he could not endure it any longer, but felt that he must
   once again enjoy communion with his Lord and experience the power of
   the Holy Spirit in his preaching. So he stopped at the foot of Cader
   Idris and spent some three hours in an intense agony of prayer. And the
   result was that when he next preached, he did so with all the unction
   and power which had formerly rested upon him. He had grown weary of the
   absence of Christ and therefore Christ returned to him! O brethren, if
   Christ makes as though He would go further, do not let Him go, but hold
   Him fast!

   29-33. But they constrained Him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
   toward evening, and the day is far spent And He

   went in to tarry with them. And it came to pass, as He sat at the table
   with them, He took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to
   them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him, and He vanished
   out of their sight. [See Volume 56 www.spurgeongems.org 7

   Sermon #681, Volume 12--EYES OPENED.]

   Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the way,
   and while He opened to us the Scriptures? And they rose up the same
   hour, and returned to Jerusalem. This shows their zeal and also their
   courage! This news was too good to be kept to themselves and although
   it was nearly night, and they had a good distance to go, in a country
   that was far from safe for travelers, they "returned to Jerusalem"--

   33-36. And found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with
   them, saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon. And
   they told what things were done in the way, and how He was known of
   them in breaking of bread. And as they spoke, Jesus Himself stood in
   the midst of them, and said unto them, Peace be unto you [See Sermon
   #1958, Volume 33--THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE RISEN LORD TO THE
   ELEVEN.] No more appropriate greeting could have been given to the
   troubled disciples!

   37-53. But they were terrified and frightened, andsupposed that they
   hadseen a spirit. AndHe said to them, why are you troubled? And why do
   thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold My hands and My feet, that it is
   I, Myself: handle Me and see: for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as
   you see I have. And when He had thus spoken, He showed them His hands
   and His feet. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, He
   said unto them, Have you here any food? And they gave Him a piece of a
   broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And He took it, and did eat before
   them. And He said to them, These are the words which I spoke unto you,
   while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were
   written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms
   concerning Me. Then opened He their understanding, that theymight
   understand the Scriptures. AndHe said to them, Thus it is written, and
   thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third
   day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
   His name among all nations, beginning in Jerusalem. And you are
   witnesses of these things. And, behold, I send the promise of My Father
   upon you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued
   with power from on high. And He led them out as far as to Bethany, and
   He lifted up His hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass, while He
   blessed them, He was parted from them, and carried up into Heaven. And
   they worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: and were
   continually in the Temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

The Soul's Food and Drink

   (No. 3192)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 5, 1873.

   "For My flesh is food, indeed, and My blood is drink, indeed." John
   6:55.

   IT was our Lord Jesus Christ who uttered these words and some of those
   who heard Him misunderstood His meaning, for they asked, "How can this
   Man give us His flesh to eat?" This is not altogether surprising, for
   there are still millions of persons upon the earth who will persist in
   understanding literally what our Lord intended to be understood
   spiritually. To us who know the meaning of Christ's words, it seems
   monstrous that anyone could have supposed that Jesus meant men to eat
   His real, literal flesh and to drink His actual blood! I must confess
   that, to me, it seems an instance both of the utter depravity of human
   nature and of the absolute insanity to which sin has driven
   mankind--that there are still so many persons existing in what we call
   this enlightened age who actually believe that we can eat the flesh of
   Christ and drink His blood! This is a cannibal notion which only needs
   to be mentioned to be denounced. Instead of having anything sacred
   about it, such teaching is utterly detestable--it is inconceivably
   idiotic and blasphemous! Idiocy and blasphemy seem to be blended
   together in it in about equal proportions. It is strange that such
   blessed words from such blessed lips should have been so shamefully
   misunderstood and misrepresented.

   Beloved Friends, as many of you as have been taught of God, know the
   spiritual meaning of these words. You know that the Doctrine of the
   Incarnation of Christ is food to your soul and you know that the great
   Truth of the substitutionary Sacrifice of Christ which is expressed by
   His blood, is the most nourishing cordial to your heart. You know that,
   in this sense, Christ's words are full of deep spiritual teaching--"My
   flesh is food, indeed, and My blood is drink, indeed." That word,
   "indeed," seems to contrast this spiritual nourishment with all
   ordinary food and drink. The best of literal food only feeds the body
   for a time, for that body ultimately decays. It is not in the power of
   food to repair the waste that is continually going on, that the
   physical system shall forever abide firm and strong. This food is food,
   but it is not "food, indeed." There are also various kinds of drink
   that refresh and invigorate the body--and by means of these we are
   enabled to continue from day to day--but where is the water, where is
   the crystal fountain that can give immortality? Where is the juice
   expressed from any fruit that grows beneath the sky that can rid the
   body of all disease and pain and cause it to live on without end You
   all know, then, among all the many kinds of literal food and drink,
   there is not any food that is worthy to be called food, indeed, nor any
   drink that is worthy to be called drink, indeed.

   That word, "indeed," also implies the contrast between this spiritual
   nourishment and all mere mental food and drink. Our soul needs
   food--and the proper food for it is truth, wisdom, knowledge. Solomon
   said, "That the soul is without knowledge, it is not good." No disciple
   of Christ who has the spirit of his Master, is opposed to the spread of
   wisdom. The "children of light" wish to have every kind of light
   disseminated as widely as possible. "Everyone that does evil hates the
   light," but he that does good loves the light and says, "The more light
   there is, the better." But there is no mental food save that of which I
   am about to speak which is food, indeed, and drink, indeed! Paul truly
   says, "Knowledge puffs up," and so it does if it is not kept under
   proper control. When a man has fed on the most profound knowledge, the
   spirit produced by such food has often been a proud and arrogant one
   which has led him to rebel against the Infinite Wisdom of God, and set
   up his own opinion in opposition to the Truths of God revealed in the
   Scriptures. What earthly knowledge is there that can afford suitable
   food to our entire manhood? Suppose I could compass the whole range of
   science--if I could thread the spheres as on a string, if I could bore
   the rocks and read the whole of their ancient history, if there were no
   secret of science left unrevealed to me--yet, if I had an aching heart,
   all my knowledge would

   not satisfy my soul or give me rest. In fact, the very acquisition of
   knowledge has often led to an increase of care. Solomon said, "Much
   study is a weariness of the flesh," and many have found it to be so. It
   certainly is not food, indeed, or drink, indeed. Poets have drunk at
   the Castilian Fountain and their verses have astonished whole nations,
   yet they have gone to their graves unsatisfied and despairing.
   Mathematicians, with wondrous minds, have mapped out the heavens,
   studied the stars, laid down the laws that govern the planets and
   traced the pathways of comets for thousands of years, yet their verdict
   has been the same as Solomon's, "Vanity of vanities; all is vanity."

   But I have to speak to you concerning knowledge which is satisfying,
   concerning truth which does content the spirit and, in doing so, I must
   draw a clear, hard and fast line. No one knows the flavor or effect of
   food and drink who has not tasted them. It is no use for me to speak to
   anyone about food which he has never seen, or handled, or tasted. If he
   is to appreciate my testimony concerning it, he must have partaken of
   it. Or if my testimony is concerning a certain drink, he must at least
   have sipped of it. Otherwise, let me speak as earnestly as I may, he
   will be unable to comprehend what I am saying. Now, my Lord Jesus is
   food, indeed, but the soulmust feed upon Him if it is to know how He
   nourishes it! He is drink, indeed, but unless this drink enters into
   the soul, it will be a stranger to the spiritual power which Jesus
   always imparts when He is received into the heart by faith! If you have
   really received Christ Jesus the Lord. If He is "in you the hope of
   glory," then He is the food of your soul and you can, from your own
   experience, confirm His declaration, "My flesh is food, indeed, and my
   blood is drink, indeed."

   I. While I am speaking, let us, each one, try to feed spiritually upon
   the two great Doctrines to which the words, "flesh," and "blood," may
   be taken to refer, namely, the Incarnation of the Son of God and His
   death as His people's Substitute. And first, let me say that THESE
   DOCTRINES ARE MOST COMFORTING FOOD TO THE SOUL.

   Where will you find any other Doctrines so comforting as these? I, a
   sinner, have broken God's righteous Law and so offended Him that I am
   driven from His Presence and am shut off from all true joy and peace.
   But, in order to redeem man, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Himself,
   became Man. "The Word was made flesh." Why it makes the joy-bells ring
   in my heart as I tell you again the old familiar story! The angels,
   when they were sent to tell men that unto them was born a Savior,
   proclaimed with joyous sounds the glad message that God had come down
   to earth. What joyful news it is for you, O men and women, that God has
   taken humanity into union with the Deity, that the Infinite became an
   Infant, that He who made the heavens and the earth was wrapped in
   swaddling clothes just as you and your own babes have been! Surely, now
   that God has thus become one with us, there must be peace on earth and
   good will toward men! He cannot be unwilling to bless those who have
   that human nature which He has, Himself, assumed! Even as I talk of
   this great Truth of God, I feel in my heart a joy that comforts me--and
   so Christ's flesh is food, indeed, to my soul! And when I think that,
   in that flesh, Jesus lived here on earth for over 30 years and knew all
   the weakness, temptation and suffering to which that flesh is
   liable--when I think how He proved Himself to be bone of our bone, and
   flesh of our flesh--then I understand how He sympathizes with the weak,
   tempted and suffering sons of men! And this makes the sad heart glad
   and so, again, Christ's flesh is food, indeed! Then, Beloved, when you
   think that He at whose belt hang the keys of Hell and of Death, once
   toiled and suffered and, at last died, just as you have to toil and
   suffer and die--and when you remember that from the heights of Glory,
   Jesus looks down both as the Son of God and the Son of Mary, does not
   this feed you with true soul-comforting food?

   Remember, also, that whatever Jesus did as Man, He did as the great
   Representative Man, who has all the while been acting on behalf of His
   people. Adam was a representative man, but I get no food for my soul
   from him. He took my bread away, he took my life away, for "in Adam all
   died." But when Christ came here as the Representative of His people,
   what did He do? He kept the Law of God perfectly and His obedience was
   reckoned as the obedience of all who were in Him! As Adam's sin was
   imputed to all who were in him as their federal head, so Christ's
   obedience was imputed to all who were in Him as their federal Head. The
   condemnation of our Surety and Substitute was our condemnation, too.
   And when He was taken away and put to death, we were crucified in Him.
   And when He was laid in the grave, we were buried with Him and, blessed
   be God, when He rose from the dead, we rose with Him and we were
   justified by His Resurrection! He could never have come out of the
   prison of the grave if He had not paid all His people's debts. And when
   He was set free, they were set free! His Resurrection was the guarantee
   of their resurrection. Is there not most comforting food for your soul
   in this great Truth? Is not Christ's flesh food, indeed, when you look
   at it as the representative body of your Substitute and Surety?

   Best of all, Christ, has gone back to Glory as the Representative of
   His people. He did not take His soul, alone, when He ascended to His
   Father, leaving His body in the tomb, but that very flesh which was
   pierced by the nails, that very flesh through which the soldier's spear
   went to His heart, He carried right up to the Throne of God and, in so
   doing, He carried us who are in Him up there and made us sit together
   in the heavenly places in Him! What joy it gives us to remember that--

   "There sits in our flesh, Upon a Throne of light One of a human mother
   born In perfect Godhead bright!"

   II. Changing the direction of our thought, yet still keeping to the
   same main track, let us turn to the second clause of

   the text. "My blood is drink, indeed." That is to say, CHRIST'S
   REDEEMING SACRIFICE IS MOST SOUL-

   SATISFYING. It is not merely soul-comforting, but soul-satisfying!

   We have stated the case hundreds of times in this place, but must state
   it yet again. Man had sinned and God was willing to forgive. But the
   inflexible law of the universe is that sin must entail punishment--and
   it is so good and righteous a law that to alter it would be ruinous!
   Therefore punishment for sin there must be--but Jesus endured the
   punishment due to all His people! In order that He might be able to do
   so, He took upon Him our flesh, and that flesh was made to bleed even
   unto death in the accomplishment of that purpose. We believe in the
   real, literal substitution of Christ in the place of all whom He had
   covenanted to save, and as many as believe in Him may know assuredly
   that their sins were transferred from them and laid upon Him! Then,
   when their sins were laid upon Christ--

   "Jehovah bade His sword awake"-- against the Sin-Bearer and He smote
   Christ instead of His people--and His flowing blood brings peace and
   pardon to them as He dies, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring
   them to God! I cannot help saying that this Doctrine fills my soul with
   an indescribable contentment! I am satisfied to the fullest when this
   Truth enters my heart and so, Christ's blood is drink, indeed, to me!

   For see, Beloved, God's justice is satisfied. How could it be otherwise
   when God, Himself, makes the Atonement? When Jesus Christ, the Son of
   God, made Himself liable for His people's guilt, what a complete
   vindication of the justice of God was there! More than that, the great
   Covenant of Grace was ratified by the blood of Christ's atoning
   Sacrifice. No testament is valid as long as the testator lives, but
   Jesus has died and, therefore, every legacy of His love is made sure to
   all those to whom He has willed it. The Covenant made with Adam fell
   through because Adam could not keep it. But the Covenant made with the
   Second Adam, the Lord from Heaven, stands fast as the everlasting
   hills, for Christ has kept it in every particular, offering to God
   complete obedience, both active and passive, in His life of holiness
   and in His death of agony! O then, my Soul, God is satisfied, your sin
   is pardoned, Covenant blessings are secured to you--so is not Christ's
   blood drink, indeed, to you? As we think that the Son of God became the
   Son of Mary in order that He might die for us, that He might take our
   place, and die in our place, what can we need more to chase away our
   fears, to fulfill our hopes and to confirm our faith? If any of you
   need more than that, it is not possible for us to present it to you, or
   even to imagine it! What the Son of God said was finished has been
   finished and, therein our souls may rest, and rest forever!

   III. But, beloved Friends, we not only need spiritual food to comfort
   and to satisfy our souls, we also need SPIRITUAL FOOD TO STRENGTHEN OUR
   SOULS. And here, again, Christ's flesh is food, indeed, and His blood
   is drink, indeed!

   How strong are they who live upon the Truth of an Incarnate God, and of
   that Incarnate God dying in the place of His people! What strength it
   gives to faith! I have seen weak faith and I have seen strong faith,
   but I have generally found weak faith associated with dependence upon
   feelings, but I have never known strong faith existing anywhere except
   in connection with Emmanuel, God With Us, living and dying in our
   place! I have seen poor humble men and women who knew little more than
   that they were lost through sin and that Christ had come to save them,
   yet they have lived and died strong in faith, giving glory to God--for
   their faith had been nourished upon this food, indeed, and drink,
   indeed, of the Incarnation and substitutionary Sacrifice of Jesus
   Christ, the Son of God and the Son of Mary!

   And fervent love is produced by the same spiritual food and drink. If
   Christ is to you merely some historic person who once appeared upon the
   earth and is now gone forever, your love for Him will be very faint if
   it exists at all! But if

   He is your own personal Savior, your ever-present Friend, your living
   Brother, bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh, your Surety and
   Substitute who bore your sins in His own body on the tree, then your
   love goes out to Him in a vehement flame! I do not wander that Mary
   Magdalene was among the holy women who were last at the Cross and first
   at the tomb, for Christ had done so much for her that she loved Him
   much. And in proportion as yourealize what His Incarnation and His
   death have done for you, your love will feed upon that food, indeed,
   and drink, indeed, until it shall become stronger even than death
   itself!

   This spiritual food and drink will also make us strong for service.
   There was a man--you will all recognize his portrait by the bare
   outline--who was at first a great enemy of Christ, but who, after his
   conversion, lived upon the food of which I have been speaking. And you
   know what an untiring servant of Christ he became. He went from city to
   city preaching the Word. He was stoned and left for dead, but he rose
   to his feet and went on preaching! His very dreams were full of service
   for his Master, for in a night vision, there stood by him a man of
   Macedonia who said to him, "Come over into Macedonia and help us." And
   immediately he obeyed the Spirit's call. The Lord blessed the Word, but
   His servant was arrested, beaten and thrust into prison--yet he and his
   companion made the prison cell ring with their joyful songs of praise
   unto their God! This man preached the Word throughout a great part of
   the then known world. We read of him at Damascus, Jerusalem, Ephesus,
   Athens, Corinth, Rome and it is probable that he even came as far as
   these islands of the West. And wherever he went, he preached Jesus
   Christ and Him crucified--and all the while he was sustained by the
   food, indeed, and drink, indeed, of the Incarnation and the atoning
   Sacrifice of the Son of God! If I had the time, I might tell you of
   other great workers for the Lord Jesus Christ whose lives were crowded
   with holy service--all of whom derived their strength from this same
   food, indeed, and drink, indeed, of which I have been speaking.

   But, Beloved, if you need further proof that the flesh of Christ is
   food, indeed, and His blood is drink, indeed, let me remind you of the
   many who have been made strong for suffering through this spiritual
   nourishment. You are all more or less familiar with the amazing story
   of the persecution of the early Christians and of their heroic
   endurance even unto death. What was it that sustained them but this
   food, indeed, and drink, indeed? Then, all along the ages, and in
   almost all lands, there have been brave men and women, and even boys
   and girls, who counted not their lives dear unto them, but gladly gave
   them up rather than deny their Lord and Savior. Foxe's Book of Martyrs
   has preserved the record of many notable instances that I need not now
   repeat, but you will do well to keep the stories in mind, and to teach
   them to your children, that they, also, may learn what suffering can be
   endured by those who have had such food for their souls as our text
   describes! No doubt there were many brave utterances like that historic
   saying of Latimer, "Be of good comfort, Master Ridley, and play the
   man! We shall this day light such a candle, by God's Grace, in England,
   as I trust shall never be put out." Surely these men had food to eat of
   which the poor puny professors of these days seem not to have tasted!
   They were made strong for suffering through partaking of this food,
   indeed, and drink, indeed, whereof if a man eats and drinks abundantly,
   he shall be fitted to perform such exploits as were worked by the
   heroes of faith of whom Paul wrote in his Epistle to the Hebrews.

   O Sirs, if you want to be strong to live, or work, or suffer for Jesus,
   you must feed upon Jesus! It is only in the strength of this food and
   this drink that one can, in these days, live an honest and upright
   life. It is only in the force derived from this food and this drink
   that anyone can bear a bold and faithful testimony for Jesus. And, mark
   you, it is only by feeding upon such food and such drink as this that
   one will be able to face death with a brave countenance and look
   forward to the unseen world with eyes undimmed! Yes, I have seen weak
   women with the hectic flush of consumption on their cheeks, and with
   the unnatural brightness which that disease imparts to the eyes--and I
   have heard them talk of dying as calmly as if they were speaking of
   going out for a day's excursion! I have even heard them singing as
   though their death day had been their wedding day, so glad were they at
   the prospect of soon being where the day breaks and the shadows flee
   away forever! Joan of Arc was never such a heroine as these women have
   been, for they have vanquished even death, itself, and waved the banner
   of the Cross all through the Valley of Death-Shade. It was this food,
   indeed, and this drink, indeed, that helped them thus to die--no, that
   prevented them from dying--for to them death was but a translation from
   a world of mortals to a world of immortal spirits around the Throne of
   God on high!

   IV. I want now to say something that cannot often be said in a great
   promiscuous congregation, lest it should be misunderstood. But it is a
   fact that certain kinds of food and drink produce EXHILARATION in those
   who partake of them, so that men become joyous and excited after they
   have been sitting long at a festival. There is often much evil in the

   excitement which results from these earthly feasts, but there is one
   kind of food and drink which gives an exhilaration which is not only
   harmless, but is truly blessed! And that is the food, indeed, and
   drink, indeed, of which I have been speaking to you. Have you
   experienced that exhilaration, my Brother? Do you know what this holy
   excitement is, my Sister? Have you, beloved Friends, ever thought of
   Christ dying on the Cross for you until you felt that you must sing for
   very joy of heart? Have you ever realized that your sins were washed
   right away in the Red Sea of your Savior's blood and that there was not
   even one of them left to oppress you? Then you must have felt that Dr.
   Watt was not in the least exaggerating when he wrote those lines that
   we have often sung--

   "Yes, we will praise You, dearest Lord,

   Our souls are all on flame!

   Hosanna round the spacious earth,

   To Your adored name.

   Angels, assist our mighty joys,

   Strike all your harps of gold!

   But when you raise your highest notes,

   His love can ne'er be told."

   Yes, I am quite sure that you have felt so glad that you have wanted
   all the angels to assist your mighty joys! When you have realized all
   that Christ's Incarnation and death have meant for you. When you have
   in a measure comprehended the transcendent Grace that made Him stoop so
   low as to become near of kin to you, your heart must surely have danced
   at the sound of His name! I feel persuaded that there must have been
   times in this Tabernacle when you were so joyful that you could hardly
   remain in your seats. When you have almost wished that, like David, you
   might see the Ark of the Lord come along and that you might dance
   before the Lord even as David did! You know that there is no other joy
   that is even for a moment worthy to be compared with the joy which
   comes to us through Jesus Christ! And the man who has once had a sip
   from that well wants to lie down beside it and drink it dry! He knows
   he can never do that, but he wishes that his soul could be so enlarged
   that he could take in all the love of his Incarnate God--the wondrous
   heights, and depths, and lengths, and breadths of that love which must
   forever surpass our knowledge! O you who want to find the highest joy
   that can be found on earth, here it is! Jesus' wounds are the Fountains
   where heavenly bliss is distilled! In Emmanuel, God With Us, born at
   Bethlehem and dying on Calvary--in His Incarnation and His atoning
   Sacrifice--you will find that food, indeed, and drink, indeed, which
   shall give the loftiest spiritual exhilaration to all who feed upon
   them!

   V. Now I close my discourse by reminding you that WHOEVER EATS THIS
   SPIRITUAL FOOD SHALL LIVE

   FOREVER.

   Just before our Lord uttered the words of our text, He had said to the
   Jews, "Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This
   is the bread which comes down from Heaven, that a man may eat thereof,
   and not die. I am the living bread which came down from Heaven: if any
   man eats of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I
   will give is My flesh which I will give for the life of the world." If
   you had lived with the children of Israel in the wilderness--and you
   had eaten manna as they did--you would have died as they did. If you
   come to the Communion Table, and merely eat bread, "not discerning the
   Lord's body," you will die. Or if you go to a so-called "priest" and he
   gives you a "consecrated" wafer, and you eat it, you will die. But
   whoever spiritually feeds upon Jesus--whoever feeds his soul upon the
   great central Truth that God in human flesh was made the Substitute for
   all who believe in Him--he shall never die! His body may pass through
   the change that we call, death, but his spirit shall live forever and,
   in due time, his body and soul shall be reunited and his complete
   manhood shall be "forever with the Lord."

   O Sinners, unless you feed upon Christ, there is nothing but eternal
   death before you! But if you receive Him into your soul even as you
   receive food into your body, you shall never die and the bliss of
   Heaven shall be your everlasting portion! I have preached to you in
   very simple language, but there is in my theme a mystery that excels
   all the wisdom of the sages. Let me try to put it before you once more
   before I close. It is a fact that the Word, who was God, and who made
   Heaven and earth, and without whom was not anything made that was
   made--it is a fact that this Word was made flesh and dwelt among men!
   In other words, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, did come into this world,
   was here born of a virgin, here lived and labored as a Man, and here
   died for those who believe in Him, "for God so loved the world that He
   gave His only-begotten Son that whoever believes in Him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life...he that believes on

   Him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already,
   because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of
   God." After Jesus had died in the place of all who believe in Him, and
   after He had risen from the grave as the sure sign that His redeeming
   work had been accomplished, and that His people were forever free, He
   returned to His Father's right hand in Glory. And there He sits as the
   Representative of all His chosen until the appointed time for Him to
   come again to this earth, "to be glorified in His saints, and to be
   admired in all them that believe." "Be it known unto you, therefore,
   brethren, that through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveness of
   sins: and by Him all that believe are justified from all things from
   which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses."

   There is the Gospel as Paul preached it! May the Spirit of God enable
   you to receive it by faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and the Son
   of Mary--and so you will find that His flesh will become to you food,
   indeed, and His blood drink, indeed. God grant it, for Jesus Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN6:22-59.

   Verses 22-24. The day following, when the people who stood on the other
   side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except that one
   which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus went not with His
   disciples into the boat, but that the disciples were gone away
   alone--however other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they
   ate bread after the Lord had given thanks--when the people therefore
   saw that Jesus was not there, neither the disciples,

   they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. [See
   Sermon #947, Volume 16--SEEKING FOR JESUS.] Everything looked very
   favorable, did it not? These people put themselves to considerable
   trouble in order to get where the Savior was--they were not satisfied
   to be away from Him--they were "seeking for Jesus."

   25, 26. And when they had found Him on the other side of the sea, they
   said unto Him, Rabbi, when did You come here? Jesus answered them and
   said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, You seek Me not because you saw
   the miracles but because you ate of the loaves, and were fille . He did
   not gratify their curiosity by telling them how or when He came there,
   for that was no concern of theirs. Neither is it the business of
   Christ's preachers to spin ingenious theories about the Gospel, or to
   tell pretty tales to amuse their hearers. Their business is to deal
   faithfully with men's hearts and consciences as their Master did when
   He said to these people "You seek Me not because you saw the miracles."
   They said that at first, no doubt. Christ's miracles dazzled them so
   they sought Him in order to see more miracles worked by Him. This was
   not the highest motive for seeking the Savior, but they had found a
   still lower one--they were now following Him because they "ate of the
   loaves and were filled." Yet the Master did not repel them and thus He
   teaches us that it is better to follow Him from the lowest motive than
   not to follow Him at all. Perhaps some of us have been too severe upon
   certain people. We have said that they come to our place of worship out
   of mere curiosity. What if they do? It is well that they come at all,
   so let us not cut even the spider's web that links a man in any sense
   with Christ--that web may grow into a thread, that thread into a cord,
   that cord into a cable and there may yet be an unbreakable union
   between that man and Christ! That which begins in an inferior way may
   lead to something higher and better. Still, it is wise to let people
   know that they are not deceiving Christ, even though they deceive
   themselves as to their motive in seeking Him. So He said to them--

   27. Labor not for the food which perishes, but for that food which
   endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto
   you: for Him has God the Father sealed. They labored hard in order to
   get the bread that perishes, so Christ bade them devote their energies
   to a better objective. This is a very extraordinary verse if we regard
   the letter of it and not the spirit. Christ told these people not to
   labor for that which they could only get by labor--"Labor not for the
   food which perishes." Yet few men get their daily bread or meat without
   laboring for it. And then Christ told them to labor for that which
   nobody ever does get by laboring--"Labor for that food which endures
   unto everlasting life." This is an instance of how the mere letter of
   the Word kills. We must take the spirit of it--and then we understand
   that what the Savior meant was this--"Do not be spending all your
   energies to get that which will melt away when you get it, but spend
   your time and strength in seeking after that which will last through
   all time and be yours to all eternity."

   28. Then said they unto Him, What shall we do, that we might work the
   works of God?They wanted to do the greatest of all works for, by, "the
   works of God," they evidently meant the most important, the most
   sublime, the greatest of all works. "What shall we do in order to work
   such works as these?"

   29. Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you
   believe on Him whom He has sent This is an amazing statement which is
   just as true, now, as when Christ uttered it in Capernaum! The greatest
   and best work that any of you can do is to believe on Jesus Christ!
   Though, in another sense, this is not a workat all--but ceasing from
   your own works and resting in the finished work of Jesus Christ. But if
   any man would do that which is most acceptable to the thrice-holy God,
   let him believe on Jesus Christ whom God has sent!

   30. They said therefore unto Him, what sign will You show us, then,
   that we may see and believe You? What work will You do?This was a
   shameful question to put to Christ when they had so recently been
   miraculously fed by Him and so had received the best sign of His Divine
   Power in the multiplication of the loaves and fishes!

   31-34. Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, he
   gave them bread from Heaven to eat Then Jesus said to them, Verily,
   verity, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from Heaven, but
   My Father gives you the true bread from Heaven. For the bread of God is
   He who comes down from Heaven and gives life unto the world. Then they
   said unto Him, Lord, give us this bread always. This would have been a
   good prayer if they had understood the meaning of the Savior's words
   but, as it was, it was a blind prayer. They did not know what Jesus
   meant when He spoke of the bread of God which come down from Heaven.
   They were thinking about the bread that perishes--the bread for the
   body--so they prayed blindly when they said, "Lord, give us this bread
   always." Do you not think that many a prayer which children are taught
   in their childhood--and which men and women continue to pray for
   years--may be as blind a prayer as this one was? They know not what
   they ask and so the question very naturally arises as to whether it is
   a prayer at all?

   35. And Jesus said to them, I am the Bread of Life. He who comes to Me
   shall never hunger and he who believes on

   Me shall never thirst" [See Sermon #1112, Volume 19--SOUL-SATISFYING
   BREAD.] 'I will take away his need by removing his hunger. I will take
   away his pain by removing his thirst."

   36. But I said to you that you have seen Me, and yet do not believe.
   See, then, how little there was of advantage in the mere sight of
   Christ. Many seem to think that it must have been much easier for
   people to believe in Christ if they had actually seen Him, but it was
   not so. There were multitudes that saw Him and saw His miracles--and
   even ate the bread which came from His wonder-working hands--yet they
   believed not. Faith does not come in that way, for it does not come by
   sight, but sight comes by faith! Seeing is not believing, but believing
   is often seeing--it opens the eyes so that they are able to see what
   before was hidden from them.

   37. All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me. God's own elect
   shall surely come to Christ. They shall all believe in Him and be saved
   by Him.

   37. And him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out [See Sermons
   #1762, Volume 30--HIGH DOCTRINE AND BROAD DOCTRINE; #2349, Volume
   40--ALL COMERS TO CHRIST WELCOMED; #2954, Volume 51--THE BIG GATES WIDE
   OPEN and #3000, Volume 52--NO. 3000--OR, COME AND WELCOME.] "Whoever he
   is that comes, I will never reject him.

   Whoever he may be that accepts Me and believes in Me, he is Mine and I
   will never cast him away from Me."

   38-44. For I came down from Heaven, not to do My own will, but the will
   of Him that sent Me. And this is the Father's will which has sent Me,
   that of all who He has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise
   it up again at the last day. And this is the will ofHim that sent Me,
   that everyone who sees the Son, and believes on Him, may have
   everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. The Jews
   then murmured at Him, because He said, I am the bread which came down
   from Heaven. And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose
   father and mother we know? How is it, then, that He says, I came down
   from Heaven? Jesus therefore answered and said to them, murmur not
   among yourselves. No man can come to Me, except the Father which has
   sent Me draws him. [See Sermons #182, Volume 4--human inability; #2386,
   Volume 40--THE DRAWINGS OF DIVINE LOVE.] "I did not expect

   that you would receive Me. I did not imagine that you would believe Me.
   You have not yet been drawn to Me by the Father, so I knew that you
   would not come to Me." But he who is drawn by the Father will come to
   Christ. And Christ tells us what will be his future lot--

   44-46. And I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the
   Prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man, therefore,
   that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes unto Me. Not that
   any man has seen the Father, except He who is from God, He has seen the
   Father. He corrects the notion into which they might have fallen that
   they could ever see the Father as He had seen Him. Into that vision
   none of us can ever enter, for there is a peculiar Divine relationship
   between Jesus and the Father which we cannot know.

   47. Verily, verily, I say unto you--Jesus uttered this great Truth of
   God with very special emphasis. "Verily, verily, I say unto you"--

   47. He that believes on Me has everlasting life. [See Sermons #1642,
   Volume 28--"VERILY, VERILY" and #2706, Volume 46--FEEDING ON THE BREAD
   OF LIFE.] That text is worthy to be printed in letters of

   gold, but even then the letters would be far inferior to the message
   itself! If it is written on all your hearts by the Holy Spirit, you
   will not need any other sermon than this Divine text--"Verily, verily,
   I say unto you, He that believes on Me has everlasting life."

   48-51. I am the Bread of Life. Your Fathers did eat manna in the
   wilderness and are dead. This is the bread which came down from Heaven
   that a man may eat thereof and not die. I am the living bread which
   came down from Heaven: if any man eats of this bread, he shall live
   forever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give
   for the life of the world. Here we have the Doctrine of the great
   atoning Sacrifice by which sin is put away, and that is not merely
   Christ Incarnate, but Christ yielding up His life, dying in the place
   of guilty sinners. That is the food, whereof, if any man eats he shall
   live forever.

   52. The Jews therefore quarreled among themselves, saying, How can this
   Man give us His flesh to eat?These Jews were still stumbling at the
   letter of Christ's words--still in their blind carnality
   misunderstanding Christ.

   53-56. Then Jesus said to them, verily, verily, Isay unto you,
   Exceptyou eat the flesh ofthe Son ofMan, and drink His blood, you have
   no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood, has eternal
   life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For My flesh is food,
   indeed, and My blood is drink, indeed. He that eats My flesh, and
   drinks My blood

   dwells in Me, and I in him. [See Sermon #1288, Volume 12--TRULY EATING
   THE FLESH OF JESUS.] Do not any of you interpret this teaching of
   Christ as the Jews did, after a carnal fashion, and fancy that we
   literally eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ when we come to
   the Communion Table. The Lord's Supper was not instituted at the time
   that our Savior spoke these words and He was speaking of quite another
   matter--the spiritual reception of Christ--the real and true feeding by
   faith with our spirit upon the Lord Jesus Christ.

   57-59. As the living Father has sent Me, andIlive by the Father: so he
   that eats Me, even he shalllive byMe. This is that bread which came
   down from Heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he
   that eats of this bread shalllive forever. These things said He in the
   synagogue, as He taught it in Capernaum.

The Man Whose Hand Stuck to His Sword

   (No. 3193)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the
   three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were
   there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone
   away: he arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and
   his hand stuck unto his sword: and the LORD worked a great victory that
   day; and the people returned after him only to spoil." 2 Samuel
   23:9,10.

   IN David's muster-roll we find the names of many mighties and they are
   honored by being found there. These men came to David when his fortunes
   were at the lowest ebb and he, himself, was regarded as a rebel and an
   outlaw. And they remained faithful to him throughout their lives. Happy
   are they who can follow a good cause in its worst estate, for theirs is
   true glory. Weary of the evil government of Saul, they struck out a
   path for themselves in which they could best serve their country and
   their God. And though this entailed great risks, they were amply
   rewarded by the honors which in due time they shared with their leader.
   When David came to the throne, how glad their hearts must have been!
   And when he went on conquering and to conquer, how they must have
   rejoiced, each one of them remembering with intense delight the
   privations which they had shared with their captain. Brothers, we do
   not ourselves aspire to be numbered with the warlike. The roll of
   battle does not contain our names and we do not wish that it should.
   But there is a roll which is now being made up--a roll of heroes who do
   and dare for Christ, who go outside the camp and take up His reproach
   and, with confidence in God, earnestly contend for the faith once
   delivered to the saints and venture all for Jesus Christ! And there
   will come a day when it will be infinitely more honorable to find one's
   name in the lowest place in this list of Christ's faithful disciples
   than to be numbered with princes and kings! Blessed is he who can this
   day cast in his lot with the Son of David and share His reproach, for
   the day shall come when the Master's Glory shall be reflected upon all
   His followers!

   I. We will now turn our attention to one particular hero, Eleazar, the
   son of Dodo, and see what he did for his king and country. Our text
   records one of his feats. It is very instructive and the first lesson I
   gather from it is THE POWER OF INDIVIDUAL ENERGY.

   The Philistines had set the battle in array. The men of Israel came out
   to fight them but, for some reason or other, "being armed and carrying
   bows, they turned back in the day of battle." Ignominious is the
   record, "the men of Israel were gone away." This man, Eleazar, however,
   made up for the failures of his countrymen, for "he arose, and smote
   the Philistines." He was a man of marked individuality of character, a
   man who knew himself and knew his God, and did not care to be lost in
   the common mass, so as to run away merely because they ran. He thought
   for himself and acted for himself--he did not make the conduct of
   others the measure of his service, but while Israel fled--"he arose,
   and smote the Philistines."

   The personal obligation of each individual before God is a lesson which
   all should learn. It is taught us in our Baptism, for there each
   Believer makes his own confession of faith and, by his own act and
   deed, avows himself to be dead with Christ. Pure Christianity knows
   nothing of proxies, or sureties in Baptism! After our profession of
   faith is made, the Believer is responsible for his own religious acts
   and cannot employ priests or ministers to perform his religion for him.
   He must himself, pray, search the Scriptures, commune with God and obey
   the Lord Jesus. True religion is a personal thing. Each man, with one
   talent or with ten, will, on the Great Day of Judgment, be called to
   account for his own responsibilities, and not for those of others. And,
   therefore, he should live as before God, feeling that he is a separate
   personality and must, in his own individuality, consecrate
   himself--spirit, soul and body--entirely to the Lord. Eleazar, the Son
   of Dodo, felt that he must play the man, whatever others might do, and,
   therefore, he bravely drew his sword against the un-

   circumcised Philistines! I do not find that he wasted time in
   upbraiding the others for running away, nor in shouting to them to
   return--he just turned his own face to the enemy and hewed and hacked
   away with all his might! His brave example was sufficient rebuke and
   would be far more effectual than ten thousand sarcastic orations!

   Never let it be forgotten that our responsibility, in a certain sense,
   begins and ends with ourselves. Suppose you entertain the opinion that
   the Church of God is in a very sad state? You are only responsible for
   that as far as you, yourself, helped to create that condition. Do you
   regret that many persons with much wealth do not consecrate their
   substance? I do not wonder that you feel thus, but, after all, the most
   practical thing is to use your own substance in your Master's cause! It
   is very easy to pick holes in other people's work, but it is far more
   profitable to do better work yourself. Is there a fool in all the world
   that cannot criticize? Those who can, themselves, do good service are
   but as one in a thousand compared with those who can see faults in the
   labors of others. Therefore, if you are wise, my Brothers and Sisters,
   do not quibble as others, but arise and smite the Philistines!

   Our responsibility is not diminished by the evil conduct of other men
   but, on the contrary, it is increased thereby. You say, "How so?" I
   answer--If every man fights his best, then Eleazar may be well content
   to fight as well as the rest. But if other men are running away,
   Eleazar is called upon, by that unhappy circumstance, to rise above
   himself and retrieve the fortunes of the day. It will never do to allow
   the enemy to triumph and, therefore, if we have fought well, before, we
   must now gird up our loins for extraordinary battle. Dear Christian
   Brother, if you are solemnly impressed that the condition of the
   Churches is not what it should be, you must leave no stone unturned to
   set it right! Are your fellow Christians worldly? You should become
   more spiritual and heavenly-minded! Are they sleepy? Be you the more
   awake! Are they lax? Be you the more strict! Are they unkind? Be you
   the more full of love! Set your watch all the more strictly because you
   see that others are overcome. And be you doubly diligent where you
   perceive that others are negligent. Dare, like Eleazar, to stand alone
   and, from the shortcomings of others, gather motives for a nobler life!

   Perhaps Eleazar on that occasion was the better off for not having that
   cowardly rout at his heels. When we have good work to do for our Lord,
   we are glad of the company of kindred spirits determined to make the
   good work succeed. But if we have no such comrades, we must go alone.
   There is no absolute necessity for numbers. Who knows? The friends we
   invite might be more hindrance than assistance. When Luther went to a
   holy man and told him what he had discovered in the Scriptures, the
   prudent old gentleman replied, "My Brother, go back to your cell, keep
   your thoughts to yourself, serve God and make no disturbance." Dear old
   soul, he little dreamed what disturbance that Luther was going to make
   in the camp! I daresay Luther would not have been able to work such a
   reformation if he had been surrounded by a host of kind, prudent
   friends! But when, like the hero of our text, he was clear of all the
   excellent incapables, he made splendid havoc of the Philistines of
   Rome! When dear, good, motherly Christian men are forever saying, "Do
   not be too venturesome, be careful never to offend, do not over-exert
   yourself," and all that kind of talk, a man is better without them than
   with them! A Christian should seek the help of his Brothers and
   Sisters, but, at the same time, if he is called to a service for his
   Lord and they will not aid him, let him not be alarmed, but let him
   consider that if he has God with him he has all the allies he needs!
   The mighty God of Jacob is better than all the armies of the saints!
   And if He shall put out His hand and say, "Go in this, your might," a
   man may be content to step forth alone--the solitary champion of Jesus
   and His Gospel! Solitary prowess is expected of Believers. I hope we
   may breed in this place a race of men and women who know the Truth of
   God and also know what the Lord claims at their hands--and are
   resolved, by the help of the Holy Spirit--to war a good warfare for
   their Lord whether others will stand at their side or not!

   II. Secondly, we have, next, in the text, A LESSON OF PERSONAL
   WEAKNESS.

   This brave man, though he arose and smote the Philistines, was only a
   man, and so he fought on "until his hand was weary," and he could do no
   more. He reached the limit of his strength and was obliged to pass.
   This may somewhat console those noble men who have become brain-weary
   in the service of God. Perhaps they chide themselves, but indeed there
   is no reason for so doing, for of them it may be said as of Eleazar,
   that they are not weary offighting, though they are weary infighting.
   If you can draw that distinction in your case, it will be well. We wish
   we could serve our Lord day and night, but the flesh is weak and there
   is no more strength left in us. This is no strange thing and there is
   no sin in it. Elea-zar's weariness was that of bone, muscle, sinew--the
   weariness of his arm--but sometimes God's people grow weary in the
   brain, and this is quite as painful and quite as little to be wondered
   at. The mind cannot always think with equal clearness, or feel with
   equal emotion, or find utterance with equal clearness--and the child of
   God must not blame him-

   self for this. To blame himself in such a case would be to blame his
   Master. If your servant has been in the harvest field from daybreak
   till the moon has looked down upon him as he binds his sheaves, and if,
   as he wipes the sweat from his brow, he says, "Master, I am sorely
   wearied, I must have a few hours' sleep," who but a tyrant would blame
   him and refuse him the rest? Those areto be blamed who never weary
   themselves, but those who wear themselves out are to be commended, not
   censured.

   Perhaps Eleazar became weary because of the enormous number of his
   enemies. He cut dozens of them down with his death-bearing sword, but
   on they came, and still on! It seemed like a repetition of the day when
   Samson slew heaps upon heaps, and smote Philistia hip and thigh with
   great slaughter. Christian Friend, you have been the means of bringing
   some few to Christ, but the appalling number of the unconverted
   oppresses you till your mind is weary. You have opened a little room
   and a few poor people attend, but you say to yourself, "What are these
   among so many?" When we begin in the Master's service, we think we
   shall turn the world upside down in six weeks--but we do not do it and
   when we find that we must plod on and not despise the day of small
   things--we are apt to become weary. Lifelong service under great
   discouragement is not as easy as mere dreamers think.

   Perhaps Eleazar grew tired because nobody was helping him. It is a
   great assistance to receive a word of good cheer from a comrade and to
   feel that, after all, you are not alone, for other true hearts are
   engaged in the same battle, zealous for the same Lord! But as Eleazar
   looked around, he saw only the backs of the retreating swords who ought
   to have been fighting by his side, and he had to mow down the
   Philistines with his lone sword. Who marvels that at length he grew
   weary?

   The mercy of it all is this--that he only became weary when he could
   afford to be so--that is to say, the Lord did not allow his weariness
   to overcome him till he had beaten the Philistines and the people had
   rushed upon the spoil. We are such very feeble creatures that faintness
   must come over us at times, but what a mercy it is that the Lord makes
   our strength equal to our day! And only when the day is over does He
   let us sink into ourselves. Jacob wrestled with the Angel and he did
   not feel the shrinking sinew till he had won the blessing. It was good
   for him to go limping on his thigh after his victory--to make him know
   that it was not by his own strength that he had prevailed with God. And
   so it was a good thing for Eleazar to feel weary, for he would now
   understand where the strength came from with which he smote the
   Philistines. Eleazar only failed when there was spoil to be
   divided--and if you and I only shrink back when there is praise to be
   awarded, we need not be troubled, for there are plenty who have never
   done anything else who will be quite ready to claim the credit of all
   that is achieved!

   Let us ask ourselves whether, weak as we are, we have given up
   ourselves to the Lord. If so, all is well, He will use our weakness and
   glorify Himself by it. He will not let our weakness show itself when it
   could endanger the victory. He gives us strength up to the point where
   strength is absolutely essential--and if He lets us collapse, as Elijah
   did after his great conflict was over--we must not be surprised. What a
   difference there is between Elijah on Carmel triumphant over the
   priests of Baal, and the same man on the morrow fleeing from Jezebel
   and crying, "Let me die, for I am no better than my fathers." Of course
   that was the natural result of the strong excitement through which he
   had passed, just as the weariness of his hands was the natural result
   of the mighty battle which Eleazar had fought. And when you become
   downcast, as I often am after having obtained a great blessing, do not
   be so very terribly alarmed about it. What does it matter? The work is
   over! You can afford to be laid low before God. It will be well for you
   to know how empty and how weak you are, that you may ascribe all Glory
   to the Lord alone. He is almighty, however weak you may be!

   III. There is a third lesson in the text, and that concerns THE
   INTENSITY OF THE HERO'S ZEAL.

   A singular circumstance is here recorded--his hand stuck to his sword.
   Mr. Bunyan seems to have thought that it was the congealed blood which
   fastened the hand and the sword together, for he represents Mr.
   Valiant-for-Truth as being wounded till the blood ran forth and his
   hand was glued to his sword. But perhaps the better interpretation
   refers to the fact which has occasionally been observed in battles. I
   remember reading of a sailor who fought desperately in repelling a
   boarding attack from an enemy's ship. And when the battle was over, it
   was found that he could not open his hand to drop his cutlass. He had
   grasped it with such force that until a surgical operation had been
   performed, it was quite impossible to separate his hand from his sword!

   This was the case with Eleazar--this sticking of his hand to the sword
   proves the energy with which he gripped his weapon. At the first, he
   laid hold upon it in the right way, so that he could hold it firmly. I
   wish that some of our converts would get hold of the Gospel in a better
   manner. A missionary said to me, the other day, "There are numbers of
   revival converts who will never be worth anything till they are
   converted again." I am afraid it is so. The work is not deep, their
   understanding of the Gospel is not clear and their hold of it is not
   fast. They have got something which is of great good to them, I hope,
   but they hardly know what it is! They have need to come again to Him
   who has abundance of Grace and Truth to bestow, or they will never be
   worth much. Many young people do not study the Word--they pick up texts
   here and there as pigeons pick up peas, but they do not see the analogy
   of faith. But he is the man to fight for God who lays hold of the Truth
   of God by the handle and grips it as though he knew what he had--and
   knew that he had got it. He who intelligently and intensely knows the
   Word is likely to hold it fast!

   Eleazar, having grasped his sword well, retained his hold. Whatever
   happened to him in battle, he never let go of his weapon for an
   instant. If he had once opened his hand, there would have been no
   sticking, but he all the way through kept his hand on his weapon!
   According to some modern teachers, you are wise if you change your
   doctrines every week, because some fresh light may be expected to break
   in upon you. The advice is dangerous! O young man, I trust you will get
   hold of the grand old Gospel and always hold it and never relax your
   grip! And then what will happen to you? Why this--that at last you will
   not be able to relax your grip! I have frequently been delighted to
   observe the perseverance of earnest workers who have loved their work
   for Christ so heartily that they could not cease from it. They have
   served the Lord year after year in a particular work, either at the
   Sunday school or in some other useful labor. And when they have been
   ill and could no longer be in their places, their hearts and their
   thoughts have still been there! We have known them when ill with high
   fever, talking continually about the schools and the children. In their
   very dreams their good work has been on their minds--their hand has
   been stuck to the sword!

   I delight to hear the old man talk about the work of the Lord even when
   he can no longer join in it. And the dying man with "the ruling passion
   strong in death," enquiring about the Church and the services--his
   sword still sticking to his hand. Christmas Evans was known to drive
   his old pony from town to town in his journeys to preach the Gospel.
   And when he was about to die, he thought he was still riding in the old
   pony-chaise--and his last words were, "Drive on." Napoleon with his
   dying breath exclaimed, "Head of the army," and so do Christ's soldiers
   think to the last of the grand army of the saints and of Christ their
   Head. When a certain good man lay dying, he had forgotten his wife and
   his children. But, yes, when the name of Jesus was whispered in his
   ear, he said, "Oh, I know Him! He has been all my joy these fifty
   years!" See how the sword sticks to the hand!

   Years ago, we who have believed grasped the sword of the Lord with such
   a grip of cheerful earnestness that now there is established an almost
   involuntary connection between the two which cannot be severed. Every
   now and then some wise men think to convert us to skepticism, or what
   is very like it--modern thought--and they approach us with full
   assurance that we must give up our old-fashioned faith. They are fools
   for their pains, for we are at this time hardly voluntary agents in the
   matter--the Gospel has such hold upon us that we cannot let it go! We
   now believe because we must. I could sooner die a thousand deaths than
   renounce the Gospel I preach! The sophisticated arguments I have met
   with in skeptical books are not half as strong as the arguments with
   which the devil has assailed me! And yet, by His Grace, I have beaten
   him. Having run with them, the footmen cannot make us afraid. How can
   we give up the Gospel? It is our life, our soul, our all! Our daily
   experience, our communion with God, our sitting with Christ in heavenly
   places have made us invincible against all temptations to give up our
   hope! We hold our sword, it is true, but our sword also sticks to our
   hand. It is not possible that the most clever lies should deliver the
   elect, for the Lord has created such communion between the renewed soul
   and the Truth of God, that the Truth must hold us, and we must hold the
   Truth till we die. God grant it may be so with all of you!

   IV. I must pass on to notice the fourth lesson. That concerns THE
   DIVINE GLORY.

   Does the text say that his hand stuck unto the sword and that he worked
   a great victory that day? Look at your Bibles and you will see that I
   have been misquoting! It does not ascribe the victory to Eleazar, but
   it is written, "and the Lord worked a great victory that day." The
   victory was not won without Eleazar and yet it was not won byEleazar,
   but by the Lord! Had Eleazar belonged to a certain class of professors,
   he would have said, "We can do nothing, the Lord will fulfill His own
   eternal purposes," and then he would not only have done nothing, but he
   would have found fault with others if they had been forward in the
   fight! If he had belonged to another class of professors, he would have
   said, "I do not believe in the one-man ministry. I will not go alone,
   but wait till I have gathered a few Brothers who can all take a

   turn at it." Instead of either of these theories, Eleazar went straight
   to his work and the Lord gave him the necks of his enemies! And then he
   ascribed the victory, not to himself, but to the Lord! The right thing
   to do is to work as if all depended upon us and yet look to the Lord,
   alone, knowing that all depends upon Him. We must have all the humility
   and all the activity of men who feel that they cannot do anything by
   themselves, but that God works in them to will and to do according to
   His own good pleasure. You must be humbly God-reliant and personally
   resolute. Trust in God and keep your powder dry! Have you won a soul to
   Christ? Then the Lord has won the victory! Have you upheld the Truth of
   God against an antagonist? The Lord must have the glory of your
   triumph! Have you trampled down sin? Can you cry with the heroine of
   old, "O my Soul, you have trodden down strength"? Then, lay your
   trophies at the foot of the Throne of God! I am glad that my text runs
   as it does, or else some captious critic would have said that I was
   exalting man and honoring flesh and blood. No, no! The Lord has worked
   all our works in us! Not unto us, but unto His name give all the
   praise!

   V. The last lesson is one of ENCOURAGEMENT. It is said in the text that
   "the people returned after him only to spoil."

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, does it grieve you to think that many
   professed Christians seem more like unbelievers than Believers? Do you
   feel sad to see them all run away in the day of battle? Be comforted,
   then, for they can be brought back! And your personal prowess for God
   may be the means of making them return. The feeble folk, if the Lord
   makes you strong, will gather courage from your bravery. They may not
   have been able to look a live Philistine in the face, but they knew how
   to strip a dead one! You will get them back, by-and-by, when the spoil
   is to be divided. It is not a small thing, after all, to encourage the
   Lord's downcast people. Eleazar was pleased to see them in the field
   again. I daresay he did not say one rebuking word to them, but perhaps
   remarked, "Well, you have come back, have you? Share the plunder among
   yourselves!. I might claim it all myself, but I will not--you are
   welcome to it." It has sometimes happened that one man, speaking in
   God's name, has turned a community in the right way. One Christian
   woman, too, has saved thousands. There are points in the history of
   England where certain individuals have been the hinge upon which our
   nation's destiny has turned. If you seek of God to be faithful, and if
   His Grace is in you, then be firm in the day of battle and you will
   confirm other wavering souls. My young Sister, you will yet turn your
   family around--one by one they will come to seek our Savior! Young
   Brother, you are entering into that large house of business. It is very
   perilous to yourself, but if the Lord enables you to be strong in the
   power of His might, you may transform that whole house into a Church of
   God! You may hardly believe it, but you will yet have Prayer Meetings
   in that large room! Remember Mr. Sankey's hymn--

   "Dare to be a Daniel!

   Dare to stand alone!

   Dare to have a purpose firm!

   Dare to make it known!"

   Dare to be an Eleazar and go forth and smite the Philistines alone! You
   will soon find that there are others in the house who have concealed
   their sentiments--but when they see you coming forward--they will be
   openly on the Lord's side. Many cowards are skulking about--try to
   shame them. Many are undecided--let them see a brave man and he will be
   the standard-bearer around whom they will rally!

   Thus have I thought to say a few practical words which I hope the Lord
   will bless. I have finished when I have made one observation to a
   different class of people. It is clear that when a man gets hold of a
   sword, grips it fast, and holds it for a while, such a thing may happen
   that he cannot drop it. Has it ever occurred to you--to you especially
   who have never given your hearts to Christ--that the eager way in which
   you hold your sin--and the long time that you have held it--may produce
   a similar result upon you? One of these days you may be unable to get
   rid of those habits which you are now forming! At first, the net of
   habit is made of cobwebs. You can soon break through it. By-and-by it
   is made of twine. Soon it will be made of rope and, last of all, it
   will be strong as steel--and then you will be fatally ensnared! Beware
   in time! Young man, you are hardly yet aware how strong a hold your
   habits have already taken upon you. I mean your habits of
   prayerlessness, your practice of secret sin and your intemperance. No,
   I will not mention all your follies--they are best known to yourself.
   They are fastening upon you like huge serpents, coil upon coil. You
   have always intended to go so far and no further, but if you could see
   a picture of what you will become, you would be horrified!

   Did we not read in the papers, a few months ago, the story of a man who
   was respectable in many ways, and gifted above the average of men, who
   nevertheless descended by degrees, till he perpetrated a horrible crime
   which made the world stand aghast? Little did he dream, at one time,
   that he would have plunged into such wickedness! But the path to Hell
   is downhill and if you descend one step, at first, you take two steps
   at once next time, and then you take four, and so by great leaps
   descend to Hell. O Man, cast away the weapon of iniquity before it
   glues itself to your hand! Cast it away at once and forever!

   The only way of breaking with sin is to unite with Christ. No man does
   in heart part with sin till he is one with his Savior--and that comes
   by trusting Him, simply trusting Him. When you trust Him, He delivers
   you from sinful habits and no longer allows you to be the slave of
   evil. "If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, you shall be free,
   indeed." Seek that freedom! May He bestow it upon everyone of us and
   then may we become heroes for Christ--and He shall have the glory,
   forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM106.

   In this Psalm we have the story of God's ancient Covenant people. And
   as we read it, we may read our own history in it if we also are His
   people. It is a mirror in which the beholder may see himself.

   Verse 1. Praise you the LOR . The Psalm begins with Hallelujah. The
   story of the Church is a succession of Hallelujahs--and the story of
   every Christian's life concerning the wonderful forbearance of God to
   him is a series of Hallelujahs.

   1. Ogive thanks unto the LORD; for He is good: for His mercy endures
   forever That is the text and this Psalm is the sermon upon it--an
   exhibition of the goodness and ever-enduring mercy of God!

   2, 3. Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? Who can show forth all
   His praise? Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that does
   righteousness at all times. These are the really blessed people! And we
   shall see in this Psalm how God's ancient people so often missed that
   blessing by their sin, as I doubt not that we, also, miss much of the
   sacred, sweet blessedness which would be ours if we walked more closely
   with God and were more obedient to Him.

   4, 5. Remember me, O LORD, with the favor that You bear unto Your
   people: O visit me with Your salvation; that I may see the good of Your
   chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that I may
   glory with Your inheritance. This is a suitable prayer for each one of
   us to pray before we go any further. May God hear the cries of His
   people as we each one seek the fivefold blessing!

   6. We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have
   done wickedly. God has dealt kindly and graciously with us, yet here is
   an all too true description of what we have done! "We have sinned with
   our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly."

   7. Our fathers understood not Your wonders in Egypt [See Sermon #2204,
   Volume 37--sin--its springhead, stream and sea. Yet they were very
   plain, easy to understand, for they were the wonders of power that were
   worked by God on behalf of His people! But they understood them not.

   7. They remembered not the multitude of Your mercies. They had bad
   memories as well as bad understandings. And it is so often with us--we
   remember not the multitude of God's mercies to us.

   7. But provoked You at the sea, even at the Red Sea.That was a bad
   beginning. They were only just out of Egypt and they had not yet
   crossed the Red Sea, but they provoked the Lord even there. Oh, how
   soon after our first joy does our evil nature betray itself!

   8. Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make
   His mightypower to be known. [See Sermon

   #115, Volume 3--WHY ARE MEN SAVED?.] He saved them, not for their

   own sakes, but for His name's sake, for the manifestation of His own
   power and glory. This is how God still deals with His children--not on
   the ground of their merits, but for the manifestation of His own mercy
   and Grace toward them!

   9-12. He rebuked the Red Sea, also, and it was dried up: so He led them
   through the depths, as through the wilderness. [See Sermon #72, Volume
   2--ISRAEL AT THE RED SEA.] And He saved

   them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the
   hand of the enemy. And the waters covered

   their enemies: there was not one of them left. Then believed they His
   words; they sang His praise. I would think they believed God's words
   when they could see His wonderful works, but it is a poor faith that
   needs miracles to be worked each hour or else it fails. No wonder they
   sang God's praise at the Red Sea, but, exultant as the songs of Moses
   and Miriam were, even better is that praise which rises from a broken
   and contrite heart which the Lord has delivered out of its trouble!

   13-15. They soon forgot His works; they waited not for His counsel: but
   lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
   And He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul So it
   always is with us when we begin to let our desires outrun the will of
   God. He will sometimes let us discover our own folly by granting us our
   desires. The answer to some prayers would be a dire calamity! Some pray
   for riches, and they get it--but they also get leanness in their soul.
   Some ask for earthly honors and success, and get them, but with them
   they also get leanness in their soul. And if a man is lean in his soul,
   it is not much good being fat anywhere else.

   16. They also envied Moses in the camp. Envy is a gaunt, lean, spectral
   thing--and when a soul is lean, it soon gets to be envious of others
   who are better than itself.

   16-20. And Aaron the saint of the LORD. The earth opened and swallowed
   up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. And a fire was kindled in
   their company; the flame burned up the wicked. They made a calf in
   Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. Thus they changed their Glory
   into the similitude of an ox that eats grass.What a descent it was to
   come down from worshipping the spiritual God who had worked such
   wonders for them, to the adoration of "an ox that eats grass." When we
   put our trust in men, instead of in God, we might have the same sort of
   ironical description applied to us, "They trusted in a man that must
   die, and in the son of man that is but dust." Whenever we forsake the
   Lord and put our confidence in anyone else, we are fools, indeed!

   21-23. They forgot God their savior, who had done great things in
   Egypt; wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red
   Sea. Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses, His
   chosen, stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, lest He
   should destroy them.You remember the intercession of Moses with the
   Lord, how he cried "If You will, forgive their sin--and if not, blot
   me, I pray You, out of Your book which You have written." And, beloved
   Friends, what would you and I have done if it had not been for the
   Mediator, far greater than Moses, who has stood in the breach every
   time when we have provoked the Lord--and who has so stood in the breach
   that He has borne the wrath of God which otherwise would have destroyed
   us?

   24. Yes, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not His
   word.They said that the land that flowed with milk and honey was a land
   that ate up the inhabitants thereof, and that was full of giants--and
   they could not drive them out.

   25. But murmured in their hearts, and listened not unto the voice of
   the LORD.Do we ever fall into this sin of murmuring in the family,
   murmuring in the counting-house, murmuring against men and murmuring
   against God, as they murmured in their tents?

   26-28. Therefore He lifted up His handagainst them, to overthrow them
   in the wilderness: to overthrow their seed also among the nations, and
   to scatter them in the lands. They joined themselves also unto
   Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. They turned aside from
   the pure worship of the living God to hold communion with departed
   spirits! They fell into all the horrible abominations of the heathen
   among whom they dwelt.

   29, 30. Thus they provoked Him to anger with their inventions: and the
   plague broke out upon them. Then stood up Phinehas, and executed
   judgment and so the plague was stopped.God always has somebody to stand
   up for Him--it is Moses one day, and Phinehas another. He will not
   permit His people to utterly quit their faith and be destroyed!

   31-33. And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
   generations forevermore. They angeredHim also at the waters of strife,
   so that it went ill with Moses for their sake: because they provoked
   his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. It is not
   surprising that Moses should have spoken as he did to people who so
   worried and wearied him with their rebellions and murmurings! Yet you
   see that God dealt sternly with His servant because of his sin and He
   will do the same with those of us who bear the vessels of the Lord. The
   higher our office, the greater our responsibility. One slip of temper
   in the meek Moses shuts him out of the Promised Land! So see what sin
   will do and see how one who sins in a smaller degree than others may be
   made a scapegoat for them.

   34-36. They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
   commanded them: but were mingled among the heathen and learned their
   work And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. God
   warned them that it would be so! He told them that they must drive out
   those Canaanites and not make a league with them, or else they would be
   sure to be led astray by them.

   37, 38. They even sacrificed their sons and daughters unto devils, and
   shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their
   daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land
   was polluted with blood. Yet these were God's people whom He brought
   out of Egypt--whom He tutored in the wilderness, whom He fed with
   manna, and to whom He gave miraculous streams from the Rock--these were
   the only people in the world whom God had chosen as His own! The rest
   were sitting in darkness, yet see at what degradation they had fallen!

   39. Thus were they defiled with their own words, and played the harlot
   by their own inventions. They were not true to God--they plunged into
   every kind of uncleanness.

   40, 41. Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against His people,
   insomuch that He abhorred His own inheritance. And He gave them into
   the hand of the heathen, and they that hated them ruled over them. Read
   the history of God's ancient people and you will see how often this
   occurred.

   42-44. Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
   subjection under their hand. Many times did He deliver them; but they
   provoked Him with their counsel, and were brought low for their
   iniquity. Nevertheless--[See

   Sermon #1886, Volume 32--GOD'S REMEMBRANCE OF HIS COVENANT.] Oh, that

   wonderful, "nevertheless"--

   44-48. He regarded their affliction, when He heard their cry: and for
   their sake He remembered His Covenant, and repented according to the
   multitude of His mercies. He made them also to be pitied of all those
   that carried them captives. Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from
   among the heathen, to give thanks unto Your holy name, and to triumph
   in Your praise. Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
   everlasting; and let all the people say, Amen. Praise the LORD. And
   well we may!

A Look and Its Lessons

   (No. 3194)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 12, 1873.

   "Hearken to Me, you that follow after righteousness, you that seek the
   LORD: look unto the rock where you were hewn, and to the hole of the
   pit where you were dug." Isaiah 51:1.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text, is #1050, Volume
   18--A BRIGHT LIGHT IN DEEP SHADES.]

   THESE words were addressed to those who were already the people of God.
   No others could be thus exhorted to look unto the rock where they were
   hewn, since they have never been hewn from it. Nor to the hole of the
   pit where they were dug, for they still are in the hole of the pit.
   They are lost and ruined and they still remain in that condition. But
   the people of God have been broken off that rock by a blow from the
   Divine hammer. They have been brought up from the horrible pit by the
   might of the Divine arm and their feet are now firmly fixed upon the
   Rock of Ages!

   The people of God are here described as those "that follow after
   righteousness." That is the direction in which their life generally
   flows. They are not perfect, but they want to be. They do not love that
   which is unrighteous, but they desire to be right in all things both
   before God and before men. They are also said to be those "that seek
   the Lord," that is to say, they are those who could not live without
   seeking the Lord in prayer, or in public or private worship. Their
   great objective in life is to glorify God, to make Him famous among the
   sons of men--and they desire to devote all their time, talents and
   powers of every kind to His service and honor!

   It is to such privileged people as these that the message of our text
   is addressed! And surely they will give good heed to it. Yet the form
   in which the message is put implies that there is need for a special
   call to attention. Lest those who are addressed should fail to attend
   as earnestly as they ought, the command, "Hearken to me," puts the
   message before them in urgent and impressive tones. Come then, Beloved,
   and listen to it and let your inmost souls hear what the text has to
   say to you--"Look unto the rock where you were hewn, and to the hole of
   the pit where you were dug."

   So, first, let us look where we are told to look. And secondly, let us
   learn the lessons which that look is intended to teach us.

   I. First, then, LET US LOOK WHERE WE ARE TOLD TO LOOK--"unto the rock
   where you were hewn, and to the hole of the pit where you were dug."

   Look back then, first of all, to your nature's origin in the Garden of
   Eden. Look at that man and woman perfect in beauty, without blemish
   from head to foot, and altogether spotless in mind and heart as they
   came fresh from their Creator's hands! They are placed in a garden
   which is as perfect as they are. All that is fragrant to the smell,
   gratifying to the taste and lovely to the eyes, they have in the
   greatest profusion. The man's easy task was to dress and keep the
   garden which would have spontaneously yielded all that he and his
   required. And the tenure upon which he might have held that fair estate
   for himself and his heirs forever was very simple and clear--"Of every
   tree of the garden you may freely eat, but of the Tree of the Knowledge
   of Good and Evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat
   thereof, you shall surely die." To eat of that tree would show that man
   had revolted from his allegiance to his Sovereign, that he had ceased
   to depend upon the God who had created him and set up on his own
   account. And it would be, in fact, a declaration of war by finite man
   against the Infinite Jehovah! Alas for us that our first parents were
   not immune from temptation! Mother Eve, deceived by the serpent, took
   of the forbidden fruit and ate of it and gave some to her husband, and
   he also

   ate of it--and then their eyes were opened and they perceived that they
   were naked to their shame before God--and they hid themselves when they
   heard His voice in the garden in the cool of the day.

   Poor Adam, he was our Covenant head and there could not have been a
   Covenant that would have been more easy to keep--only leave the fruit
   of that one tree alone--and you and all your descendants shall enjoy
   perpetual happiness! Only be obedient to the God who made you, and you
   shall bring upon yourself and all your posterity continual holiness and
   joy! It is foolish for anyone to complain because Adam was made our
   representative, for had we all been present to chose the man who would
   stand as our federal head, we would certainly have selected Adam, for
   there has never been another man so well qualified as he was for such a
   responsible position. Yet, perfect man as he was, he fell--and terrible
   was the result of that fall both for himself and for all his posterity!
   Out of the garden he must go for he was no longer fit to remain in such
   a paradise as Eden was--and he must go where he would learn, by painful
   experience, the effects of his sin--where the earth would bring forth
   thorns and thistles and its scanty harvests (compared with the
   abundance of Eden) would only be gained by long and toilsome labor.
   This was a necessary discipline of love which was enforced by the very
   mercy of God, since Adam's nature was no longer what it had been
   before. He began by doubting the truth of God's word and then he went
   further and imagined that he might do as he pleased, and be his own
   god--that he might disobey God and yet be a gainer, for he believed the
   lie of the serpent--"You shall not surely die, for God knows that in
   the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened and you shall
   be as gods, knowing good and evil."

   Our earthly father had set himself up as a rival to our Father in
   Heaven! And because he was our representative, we were all doomed to be
   born into this world rebellious in our very nature, prone to evil even
   from our birth. You, child of God, stand tonight at the foot of the
   Cross, "accepted in the Beloved," but look back to the place where you
   once stood in the person of your representative, the first Adam. You
   then stood outside the Garden of Eden, and sorrowfully gazed upon the
   "flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the Tree of
   Life." You do not fear that sword, now, for it has been sheathed in
   your Savior's heart, and its flames have been quenched in His blood.
   And therefore you can now stand at the foot of the Cross and,
   by-and-by, you shall stand at the gates of pearl--no, more--you shall
   pass through that gate and stand before the Throne of the Eternal, a
   soul reclaimed, restored, perfected and made meet to dwell forever with
   the thrice-holy One! But while you think of your present privileges and
   of the bliss that is in store for you, do not forget to look back "unto
   the rock where you were hewn, and to the hole of the pit where you were
   dug." Let us now look back and see our original in another light.

   Let us look at human nature as it is nowand see how it became tainted
   by our first parents. But when I say, "Let us look at human nature as
   it is now," I remember that this is a sight which I am unable to reveal
   to you in all its horrors, for man, by nature, is exceedingly sinful
   and "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil
   continually." Our heart, by nature, is a very forge of the devil--and
   when man speaks blasphemy, it is but the sparks flying out of the
   forge! And when he works iniquities, these are but the glowing coals
   which Satan has fanned into a flame. "The prince of the power of the
   air...now works in the children of disobedience, among whom we, also,
   all had our conversation in times past," whatever change Divine Grace
   may have worked in us. Remember, Believer in Jesus, that your heart
   was, by nature, as black as the heart of Judas! Whatever sin there may
   have been in any other man, the germ of that sin was in your
   nature--there was no superiority about you, by nature, to any other
   member of the human race. However excellent your parents may have
   been--and God forbid that I should disparage them--it is still true,
   "That which is born of the flesh is flesh." It must be so. From
   defilement--and that is in the parents--there can only come defilement.
   There cannot be a crystal stream from an impure fountain!

   Your nature, then, whatever God may have made it now, was that of a
   fallen being, a revolted being, one who had gone astray from God. The
   heart is, naturally, a cage of unclean birds, a den of evil beasts. And
   he who has been taught to see all its abominations is the most
   horrified at them! We read of the fountains of the great deep that were
   broken up in the days of Noah, but there are deeps of iniquity and
   transgression in every human heart, which, if they were not restrained
   by education, by the laws of the land and by the voice of conscience,
   would pour forth in a terrible flood that would ruin the sinner and
   ruin society at the same time! "The heart is deceitful above all
   things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?" We never do know it
   until the Spirit of God convinces us of sin, of righteousness and
   ofjudgment-- and it is well for Christians, who have been thus taught
   of the Spirit, oftentimes to look back to the rock where they were
   hewn, and to the hole of the pit where they were dug.

   Now let us look back upon human nature as it has been seen in the
   history ofmankind. What a strange creature man is! How near akin to
   Deity when Divine Grace changes his whole nature--how near akin to
   devilry when he is left to himself! What crimes are there that men have
   not committed? The true story of the human race is a disgrace to us
   all. You cannot read the history of mankind without discovering the
   fact that for cruelty to men, no beast has ever equaled man and that
   for perfidy, treachery, and deceit, no serpent with its cunning, its
   fascination and its deadly venom can be compared with man! What fierce
   lion, ranging across the plains of Africa, has ever been equal in
   destructive force to a conqueror at the head of a victorious army? And
   what cobra, lurking by the wayside, ready to slay its victim, has ever
   been so full of venom as certain men have shown in the pursuit of their
   ambitions, utterly careless of the lives and happiness of their fellow
   men? There have been men who have let loose the cruel dogs of war and
   waded through rivers of human blood that they might sit upon a throne!
   The great ones of the earth have perpetrated horrible infamies and the
   lowest of the low have not been a whit better when the power has been
   in their hands. Sin has reigned equally among princes and peasants and
   every man, unless renewed by Grace, is capable of committing any crime
   that other men have committed! Some of you doubt that assertion and
   feel inclined to say what Hazael said to Elisha when the Prophet
   foretold what he would do when he had the power, "What? Is your servant
   a dog, that he should do this great thing?" He did not believe that it
   was possible that he should do such deeds, yet he did them when he had
   the opportunity--and none of us know what we might have done if we had
   been placed in the positions that others have occupied and had been
   exposed to the temptations that assailed them. If the Grace of God has
   saved us, let us be the last people in the world to begin boasting!
   But, looking back upon the crimes of which others have been guilty, let
   us contemplate what we might have done if we had not been Divinely
   restrained--and so let us again look back unto the rock where we were
   hewn, and unto the hole of the pit where we were dug.

   I must come still more closely home as I earnestly invite all here who
   love the Lord to look back upon what we were and what we did in our
   unregenerate condition. Some of us may well hide our faces and hold our
   tongues as we think of what we did before we were converted, "whereof
   we are now ashamed." Some here can remember the time when "the seat of
   the scornful" was loved by them and they had not learned to love the
   place they now occupy in God's House and among His people. Lips that
   are now consecrated to the praise of God were then defiled with oaths
   and blasphemies. Blessed be God for saving the gross open offenders,
   "and such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified,
   but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit
   of our God." As you look back to that horrible pit, bless the name of
   the Lord that He brought you up out of it!

   Others of us who were graciously restrained by God from falling into
   the grosser vices, can never look back without tears to our
   unregenerate days. We did evil as far as we could and if we did not go
   further into it, it was because there were blessed checks that held us
   in and even those bonds and restraints we hated and would have broken
   them had we dared to do so! How grieved we are now that we should ever
   have resisted as we did the appeals of Divine Mercy, the strivings of
   the Spirit, the admonitions of our godly parents and the warnings of
   Christian friends! However painful the process may be, I ask every
   Brother and Sister here to look back unto the rock where they were
   hewn, and to the hole of the pit where they were dug. It is very easy
   for you to get conceited and proud, but it would help to preserve you
   from such folly and sin if you would only remember what you used to be
   before the Grace of God made such a change in you. Then you would not
   want to sing to your own praise and glory, but you would walk humbly
   before the Lord and give all the honor to Him for what Divine has
   worked in you. This will make it a most profitable exercise for us to
   look back to see what we were before our conversion.

   There is only one more look that I ask you to give, and that is the
   saddest and most terrible of all--look, as far as you can, at the state
   of the lost. There is a land of darkness and of the shadow of death
   where the very light is as darkness, and where despair reigns supreme.
   There are no sights to be seen in that land but such as cause the eyes
   to weep. And no sounds to be heard but such as grate upon the ears, for
   He who knows all about it has told us that there shall be weeping and
   wailing and gnashing of teeth in that dead world of the lost! Stand at
   a distance from that place where the smoke of their torment goes up
   forever and ever--and if you can bear it, try to think what must be the
   condition of spirits that are at this moment, while you are sitting
   here, banished from the Presence of God and condemned to reap the
   results of the deeds done in the body! Think, also, that but for Divine
   Grace, we would have been there too. There are some here, who but for a
   special interposition of Providence might have been there now! Had that
   fever proved fatal, you would have been there, my Friend! Had that
   vessel veered just a little from her course in that dense fog, you,
   being unregenerate, would have been there to weep and wail forever!
   There is one who, before his conversation, was at death's door and at
   Hell's gate scores of times. I want you, my Brother, to think of that,
   and then you will say, "Had it not been for Divine Grace, I would have
   been this night among those lost spirits instead of being here among my
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, rejoicing in what the Lord has done for
   me and praising and magnifying His holy name!" Great as is the distance
   between the heights of Heaven and the depths of Hell, as great is the
   Lord's mercy toward you whom He has redeemed. So, looking away even to
   the abode of the lost, and trying to realize from how terrible a doom
   the Lord has delivered you, remember the rock where you have been hewn
   and the hole of the pit where you have been dug.

   II. Now, in the second place, LET US LEARN THE LESSONS WHICH THIS LOOK
   IS INTENDED TO TEACH

   US.

   I have already hinted at one result of looking back in the way I have
   described, but may again remind you that it ought to humble us. How apt
   we are to be proud! If there is one man here who says, "I am not proud,
   I am very humble," I say to him, "My dear Brother, you must excuse me,
   but I would not be surprised if you are the proudest man here, for he
   who imagines he is humble proves by that every fact how very proud he
   is." We are all proud. Pride can hide under a beggar's rags as well as
   under an alderman's robes. Pride is a weed that will grow on a dunghill
   as well as in a palace garden, but it ought never to be allowed to grow
   in the heart of a Christian! Yet I think--yes, I knowthat I have seen
   it in some who profess to be followers of the Lord Jesus Christ! Some
   professors are proud because they have got on in the world, and have
   raked together a big heap of money. But, of all kinds of pride, that is
   one of the most contemptible, for a man is no more of a man because
   there is more gold and silver in his house than in other people's. The
   man must be judged apart from his money. There is many a millionaire
   who is miserably poor, and many a truly rich man who scarcely ever has
   a shilling to spare. It is paltry pride that is proud of riches and, on
   the other hand, I have known others who had no money to make them
   proud, who were not a whit more humble than the purse-proud people, for
   pride can come in at the back door as easily as at the front!

   It is a sad thing when a Christian gets proud of his graces and says,
   "I am a very different man from what I used to be, and very different,
   also, from most other Christians. I live nearer to God. I pray more, I
   think I walk more circumspectly than others do." Perhaps he adds, "I
   glorify God for this." Mind that you do, my dear Brother, for it is
   very easy to descend from glorifying God to glorifying yourself! You
   may even be bowing down before the detestable idol of
   self-righteousness at the very time that you imagine you are glorifying
   God. The great cure for this evil is to pray to God to keep you humble
   and it will tend toward that end if you often look unto the rock where
   you were hewn and to the hole of the pit where you were dug. I have
   often told you what an old plowman said to me long ago, "Depend upon
   it, Sir, if you and I get an inch above the ground, we get just that
   inch too high." And I am persuaded that he was right. Lying in the dust
   before God is the safest and best posture for us! If we think we have
   anything of which we have reason to be proud, we are only deceiving
   ourselves. Yet there are professing Christians who seem to have quite
   forgotten what they used to be--forgotten that they were purged from
   their old sins by a miracle of mercy--and that they were made
   Christians by the almighty Grace of God. If they remembered these
   things, they would walk humbly before the Lord as they used to do. When
   they first joined the Church, they loved all their fellow members, and
   thought that each one of them was better than themselves. But now they
   are constantly picking holes in this or that Brother's character and
   finding fault with one Sister or another. When they first made a
   profession of religion, they were half afraid to unite with God's
   people lest they should be an injury to the Church and weaken it
   through their shortcomings--but now they look down with contempt upon
   those who are far better than they are ever likely to be! Such high
   looks and such proud spirits will have to be brought down if they are
   really the children of God! And though the process may be a very
   painful one, the result of it will be highly beneficial to them. They
   think themselves wonderfully fine fellows, but they forget that they
   would have been in Hell if it had not been for the Infinite Mercy and
   loving kindness of the Lord. It is a good thing when these who have
   been so proudly crowing over others get their combs cut by being made
   to feel that, after all, they are sinners just as others are and that
   if they are saved sinners, their salvation is not to be ascribed to
   themselves, but to the Grace of God through the blood and righteousness
   of Jesus Christ their Lord and Savior!

   This backward look to what we used to be will not only help to humble
   us, it will also tend to encourage us. "To encourage us?" someone asks.
   Yes, for if when we were dead in trespasses and sins, the Lord
   quickened us by His Spirit,

   how is it possible for Him to cast us away, now that we are adopted
   into His family? If He has reclaimed us from the dominion of sin and
   Satan, will He not do for us what is, after all, a less work by keeping
   us from going back to the old state of bondage? Would He have saved us
   if He had intended us to be lost at the last? Oh, no, He who has
   brought us up out of the horrible pit and out of the miry clay, and has
   set our feet upon a Rock and put a new song in our mouth, even praise
   unto our God, will never let us go back to that state from which He
   delivered us! If we wander from Him, as we are so prone to do, He will
   heal our backslidings and cause us again to rejoice in the God of our
   salvation!

   Then, dear Friends, this backward look tends to make us tender towards
   others and to encourage us to hope for their salvation. True Christians
   should never feel, "I am too good to associate with such sinful people
   as I see all around me." If he would look back to the rock where he was
   hewn, and to the hole of the pit where he was dug, he would never allow
   such a thought as that to linger in his mind for even a minute! I hear
   now and then of a minister who is said to have "a very select
   congregation." It seems to be the rule, whenever there is a very small
   number of people attending a place of worship, to say that the preacher
   is of such a high intellectual order that his ministry is not
   attractive to the masses, but that the few who go to hear him make up
   in quality what they lack in quantity. Well, I have occasionally had
   the opportunity of testing that statement, and I have come to the
   conclusion that such congregations are neither intellectually nor
   spiritually better than others--nor half as good as some with which I
   am acquainted.

   If I were to feel that I was too good to mix with the worst of men in
   the hope of being of service to them, or that I was too pure to have
   anything to do with my fellow sinners, I would be imitating the
   Pharisee who says, "Stand by, for I am holier than you," and I would
   have forgotten the rock where I was hewn, and the hole of the pit where
   I was dug. O Beloved, if you recall your own condition as sinners, you
   will love those who are still "in the gall of bitterness, and in the
   bond of iniquity," and your great desire will be to bring them to Jesus
   even as you, yourself, were brought to Him! Sometimes, when I have been
   preaching, I have had this thought in my mind, "I will not tell my
   Hearers that God can save the greatest sinners because He saved John
   Bunyan and John Newton, but I will tell them that He can save all other
   sinners because He saved me." When I have had that thought uppermost in
   my mind, I have found that I could preach with great tenderness to
   those who were out of the way. It was this feeling that led Charles
   Wesley to write--

   "He breaks the power of cancelled sin,

   He set the prisoners free!

   His blood can make the foulest clean,

   His blood availed for me."

   This ought also to be the thought and feeling of every Christian, "What
   He has done for me, He can do for others. There is no one living who is
   too far gone for His Sovereign Mercy. As He was able to save me, I will
   go to others with the hope and belief that He is able to save them. And
   I will try to encourage them to see whether there is not salvation for
   them, even for them."

   Now, lastly, I think that this backward look will tend to make us
   faithful to the Savior and fill us with a burning zeal for His Glory. I
   do not know anything better that I could suggest to you as the subject
   of your meditations, when you are at home alone and quiet for a little
   while, than to look back to the days of your impenitency and unbelief.
   I know that you will not ascribe your salvation to your own merits or
   your own good works, but that you will ascribe it to the Grace of God
   from first to last! And then the natural instinct of your renewed
   nature will make you fall down upon your knees and adore the Infinite
   Mercy of God in saving you. He might have left you to perish as He has
   left so many others, but in His Sovereignty, He looked with pity and
   love upon you and saved you. What did you do to help the Lord to save
   you? Help Him to save you? Why, you did all you could to hinder Him
   until, at last, His Omnipotent Love overcame the natural unwillingness
   of your heart and made you willing in the day of His power! Oh, you
   ought to praise God! Gratitude and adoration should constantly rise
   from your heart unto Him who has done such great things for you!

   I close by reminding every sinner here that God is able to save him,
   into whatever depths he may have fallen, for God has saved other
   sinners who were just like him. If you, my Hearer, have been guilty of
   every crime in the book, you may still be cleansed by the precious
   blood of Jesus which cleanses from all sin! There is power in His blood
   to blot out the blackest sin--and that power shall be realized by you
   if you give heed to this message--"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
   and you shall be saved." To believe is to trust, to rely upon, to
   depend upon. And if you do rely upon Jesus, all your iniquities shall
   not be reckoned unto you, but they shall be reckoned among those that
   were put away by Him when He

   bore our sins in His own body on the tree! Then all His merits shall be
   reckoned unto you--there shall be a clear exchange made--Christ taking
   your sin and you taking His righteousness! Oh, that you would believe
   on Him this very moment! May God give you Grace to do so! Then shall
   you be able, with us who also have believed in Jesus, to look back to
   the rock where you were hewn and to the hole of the pit where you were
   dug--and to adore and magnify the name of the Lord forever and ever!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: GALATIANS3.

   Verse 1. O foolish Galatians, who has bewitchedyou?Paul writes as if
   they had come under some kind of witchcraft and been deluded by it.
   This seemed to astonish the Apostle, so he cries out to them "Who has
   bewitched you?"

   1. That you shouldnot obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ
   has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?They had heard the
   plainest possible preaching from Paul and his companions. Jesus Christ
   had been so clearly set forth before them that they might, as it were,
   see Him as He hung upon the Cross of Calvary. Yet, under some
   unhallowed spell, they turned aside from the faith of Christ!

   2. This only I want to learn from you: Didyou receive the Spirit by the
   works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?

   [See Sermon #1705, Volume 29--THE HEARING OF FAITH.] "You profess to

   have received the Spirit--did the Spirit come to you by the works of
   the Law, or through hearing and believing the

   Gospel?"

   3. Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now
   madeperfect by the fesh?"Did you begin right, and are you going to
   finish in some other way? Is the foundation laid in the Truth of God,
   and will you build lies upon it? Is the foundation Jesus Christ, the
   chief cornerstone, and is the superstructure to be wood, hay and
   stubble?"

   4. Have you suffered so many things in vain--if it is, indeed, in vain.
   "Have you been made to suffer through conviction of sin? Have you even
   been persecuted for the Truth's sake? And are you going to give it up
   after all that?

   5. He therefore who ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles
   among you, does He do it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of
   fait? "Have those miracles been worked in your midst by the power of
   faith or by the works of the Law?"

   6. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
   righteousness. That is the Scriptural Doctrine-- faith is counted or
   imputed for righteousness.

   7. Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the
   children of Abraham. Those who are justified by faith in Jesus. Those
   whose faith is counted for righteousness--they are the children of
   believing Abraham--not those who are under the Law of Moses.

   8. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
   through faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, In you
   shall all nations be blessed. Just as Abraham was blessed, so are the
   nations to be blessed, that is, by faith. By faith they become his
   spiritual seed. By faith they enter into his Covenant. By faith, they
   receive the blessings of Grace.

   9. So then they which are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
   Just as the believing Abraham was accounted righteous, so believing men
   who are the spiritual seed of Abraham, are also accounted righteous.

   10. For as many as are of the words of the Law are under the curse: for
   it is written, Cursed is everyone that continues not in all things
   which are written in the Book of the Law to do them. Can any man
   perfectly keep the whole Law of God? Has any man ever continued in all
   things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them? No and,
   therefore, all that the Law does is to bring the curse upon those who
   are under its dominion--none of them can obtain salvation by the works
   of the Law!

   11. But that no man is justified by the Law in the sight of God is
   evident: for the just shall live by faith. [See Sermons

   #814, Volume 14--LIFE BY FAITH and #2809, Volume 48--FAITH--LIFE.] This
   passage is again and again repeated in the Scriptures--"The just shall
   live by faith." There are no other just men living! There cannot be any
   other just men living, but those that live by faith!

   12. And the Law is not of faith: but, the man that does them shall live
   in them. The law demands doing. The Gospel enjoins believing. The
   believing man comes in as an heir of the blessing, but the man who
   trusts to his own doing is an heir of the curse.

   13. Christ has redeemed us from the curse ofthe Law, being made a curse
   for us: for it is written, Cursedis everyone

   that hangs on a tree. [See Sermons #873, Volume 15--CHRIST MADE A CURSE
   FOR US and #2093, Volume 35--THE CURSE AND THE CURSE FOR US.] What a
   wonderful Doctrine this is! We should have he itated to use such
   language as this had not the Holy Spirit, Himself, moved Paul to write
   that Christ was "made a curse for us." He who is most blessed, forever.
   He who is the fountain of blessing and the channel of blessing to all
   who ever are blessed was, "made a curse for us: for it is written,
   Cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree"--

   14. That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
   Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise ofthe Spirit through
   faith. Dear Friends, are you living by faith upon the Son of God? Are
   you trusting in God? Are you believing His promises? Some think that
   this is a very little thing, but God does not think so. Faith is a
   better index of character than anything else. The man who trusts his
   God and believes His promises is honoring God far more than is the man
   who supposes that by any of his own doings he can merit Divine approval
   and favor.

   15. Brethren, I speak after the matter of men. Though it is but a man's
   covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no man disannuls, or adds thereto. If
   a covenant is once made, signed, sealed and ratified, no honorable man
   would think of drawing back from it. Whatever happens afterwards, the
   covenant having been once made, is regarded as an established fact and
   it must remain.

   16. 17. Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He says
   not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your Seed, which
   is Christ. And this I say, that the Law which was four hundred and
   thirty years later, cannot annul the Covenant that was confirmed before
   of God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. This is
   sound reasoning. God made a Covenant with Abraham and said that in him
   and in his Seed all nations would be blessed. All Believers are in
   Christ, who is here called Abraham's Seed and, therefore, they must be
   blessed! Whatever the Law may say or may not say, it was not given
   until 430 years after the Covenant was made with Abraham and,
   therefore, cannot affect it in any way.

   18. For if the inheritance is ofthe Law, it is no more of promise. God
   gave it to Abraham by promise. It was a free gift--He did not bestow it
   upon the condition of merit on Abraham's part. Isaac was born, not
   according to the power of the flesh, but according to promise--and the
   whole Covenant is according to free Grace and Divine promise.

   18, 19. But Godgave it to Abraham bypromise. Whatpurpose, therefore,
   does the Lawserve?[See Sermon #128, Volume

   3--THE USES OF THE LAW.] What was the use of it?

   19. It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come
   to whom the promise was made. The law makes us know what transgression
   is. It reveals its true nature. Under the hand of the Holy Spirit, it
   makes us see the evil of sin. We might not have perceived sin to be sin
   if it had not been for the command of God not to commit it--but when
   the commandment comes, then we recognize sin and the evil of it.

   19-21. Andit was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a
   mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. Is the Law, then,
   against the promises of God? God forbid! For if there had been a Law
   given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have
   been by the Law. There could not have been a better Law! Some talk
   about the Law of God being too severe, too strict, too stringent, but
   it is not. If the design had been that men should live by the Law,
   there could not have been a better Law for that purpose and, therefore,
   it is proved that by the principle of Law nobody ever can be justified,
   because even with the best of laws, all men are sinful and need that
   justification which comes only by Grace through faith!

   22. But the Scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by
   faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them

   that believe. [See Sermon #1145, Volume 19--THE GREAT JAIL AND HOW TO
   GET OUT OF IT.] All of us, by nature, are shut up like criminals in a
   prison that is so securely bolted and barred that there is no hope of
   escape for any who are within it. But why are all the doors shut and
   fastened? Why in order that Christ may come and open the one only
   eternal door of salvation--"that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ
   might be given to them that believe."

   23. But before faith came, we were kept under the Law, shut up unto the
   faith which should afterwards be revealed.

   [See Sermon #2402, Volume 41--UNDER ARREST.] Well do I remember when

   I was "shut up" in this fashion. I struggled and strove with might and
   main to get out, but I found no way of escape. I was "shut up" until
   Faith came and opened the door and brought me out into "the glorious
   liberty of the children of God."

   24. Therefore the Law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we
   might be justified by faih. [See Sermon #1196, Volume

   20--THE STERN TEACHER.] The tutor was a slave who led the children to
   school and sometimes whipped them to school. That is what the Law did
   with us--it took us under its management, whipped us and drove us to
   Christ.

   25. But after faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor. Now we go
   to Christ willingly, cheerfully, joyfully, trusting in Him with all our
   hearts. The tutor's work is done so far as we are concerned.

   26. For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. We
   hear a great deal about the universal fatherhood of God, but it is all
   nonsense! There is no Scripture for it whatever. Those only are the
   children of God who are "the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."

   27. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
   Christ. "He is everything to you. He covers you, He surrounds you. You
   do not stand before God in your own filthy rags, but you have put on
   Christ."

   28. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
   there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
   What a mercy it is to be in Christ, so that you are not seen any more,
   but only Christ, and you accepted in Him!

   29. And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs
   according to the promise. "According to the promise"--not according to
   your works, or your gifts, but "heirs according to the promise."

Christ Loosens From Infirmities

   (No. 3195)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, APRIL 28, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And, behold, there was a woman which hada spirit ofinfirmity eighteen
   years, and was bent over, and could in no wise lift herselfup. And when
   Jesus saw her, He called her to Him and said unto her, Woman, you are
   loosened from your infirmity And He laid His hands on her: and
   immediately she was made straight, and glorified God." Luke 13:11-13.

   [See Sermons #1426, Volume 24--THE LIFTING UP OF THE BOWED DOWN and
   #2891, Volume 50--A SABBATH MIRACLE-- for sermons on the same miracle.]

   OUR text commences with a "behold"--"behold, there was a woman." And as
   it was often remarked by the Puritan writers, whenever we see the word,
   "behold," in Scripture, we are to regard it as a nota bene, as a mark
   in the margin calling our particular attention to what follows. Where
   Christ worked wonders, we should have attentive eyes and ears. When
   Jesus is dispensing blessings, whether to ourselves or to others, we
   should never be in a state of indifference!

   I shall use this miracle as a type, as it were, for doubtless the
   miracles of Christ were so intended. Our Lord was declared to be "a
   Prophet mighty in deed and word." He was to be a Prophet like unto
   Moses and He is the only one who was like unto Moses in these two
   respects. Many Prophets followed Moses who were mighty in "word"--such
   as Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Isaiah, but then they were not "mighty in
   deed." Many, on the other hand, were "mighty in deed"-- like Elijah and
   Elisha, but they were not "mighty in word." Our Lord was mighty in both
   respects and a Prophet in both respects--"a Prophet mighty in deed and
   word." I take it, therefore, that His miraculous deeds are parts of His
   prophecies. They are the illustrations of His great life-sermon. The
   words which fell from His lips are as the text and the letter of the
   Book, but the miracles are the pictures from which our childlike minds
   may often learn more than from the words, themselves. We shall so use
   the picture before us now--may the Holy Spirit give us instruction!

   I. In the first place, THIS WOMAN, BOWED DOWN WITH A SPIRIT OF
   INFIRMITY, TYPIFIES TO US THE CASE OF VERY MANY--very many whom we have
   seen and some of whom are listening to these words. Oh, that the same
   miracle might be worked in them as in her! She typifies persons who are
   depressed in spirit, who cannot look up to Heaven and rejoice in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, persons who have a hope, a good hope, too, but not a
   strong one--a hope which enables them to hold on as the men did in
   Paul's shipwreck when, on boards and broken pieces of the ship they
   came safe to land, but not a hope which gives them an abundant entrance
   into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. They
   are saved, like this woman, who was a true daughter of Abraham,
   notwithstanding all her infirmities. She was truly of the promised
   seed, notwithstanding that she could not lift herself up, so these are
   genuine Christians, truly saved, and yet constantly subject to
   infirmity.

   In some, it takes this shape. They believe in Christ and rest on the
   precious blood, yet they are sometimes afraid that they have sinned the
   unpardonable sin. Though their better and more reasonable selves will
   do battle against the delusion, still they hug it to their hearts.
   Seeing that the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is a sin which is
   unto death--and that when a man has committed it, his spirit dies--and
   repentance, the desire to be saved and all good emotions cease to be
   when that dreadful spiritual death is ours, I say that they can thus
   reason with themselves in their better moments and see that their fear
   is a delusion, but they soon fall back again into that dreadful slough.
   They see no signs of Grace, but they think they see signs of
   reprobation.

   Many have I met with--I may say that I meet with such people every
   week-- who are afraid that they are hypocrites. When I encounter
   persons troubled with this fear, I cannot help smiling at them, for if
   they really were hypocrites, they would not be afraid of it and their
   fear of presumption argues very strongly that they are not living in
   it!

   Then this infirmity will take another shape. If you drive them from the
   other errors, they say they are afraid that they are self-deluded. This
   is a very proper fear when it leads to self-examination and comes to an
   end. But it becomes a very improper fear when it perpetually destroys
   our joy, prevents our saying, "Abba, Father," with an unfaltering
   tongue and keeps us at a distance from the precious Savior who would
   have us come very near to Him and be most familiar with His brotherly
   heart.

   Supposing this difficulty should be met, still there are tens of
   thousands who are very much in doubt concerning their election. What if
   they should not be elect, they say? This, of course results from
   ignorance, for if they read the Word, they would soon discover that all
   those who believe in Christ may be certain of their election--faith
   being the public mark of God's privately chosen people! If you make
   your calling sure, you have made your election sure! If you know
   yourself now to be a lover of God, resting upon the great Propitiation
   which He has set forth for sin, then you may know that this is a work
   of Grace in your soul! God never worked a work of Grace where He had
   not make an electionof Grace. That fear, therefore, may be easily
   driven away and yet thousands are in bondage to it!

   Others are afflicted with the daily fear that they shall not persevere.
   They say, "After all our professions and prayers, we fear we shall yet
   be castaways." The Apostle Paul was not afflicted with this fear. He
   strove lest this fear should ever come near him. He so lived with holy
   diligence, that he might always be in a state of blessed assurance,
   lest, after having preached to others, he, himself, should be a
   castaway. But he could say, "I know that my Redeemer lives," even as
   Job could. And he could also say, "I know whom I have believed, and am
   persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him
   against that day." Still, tens of thousands are perpetually subject to
   that form of bondage! They cannot reach, in fact, the full assurance of
   faith. They have scarcely even the glimmering of Assurance. They
   trust--they trust as the publican did, "standing afar off," but they
   have never yet come with John to lean their heads upon the bosom of the
   Savior! They are His disciples and His servants, but they can scarcely
   understand how He can call them His friends and permit them to enjoy
   close communion with Himself.

   Now, Beloved, this woman thus bowed down was very like these persons
   for the following reasons--

   Her infirmity much marred her beauty The beauty and dignity of the
   human form is to walk erect, to look the sun in the face and gaze upon
   the heavens. This woman could do nothing of the kind. She was, no
   doubt, very conscious of this and shrank from the public gaze. So
   unbelief, distrust, mistrust, suspicion--these direful infirmities to
   which some are subject, spoil their spiritual beauty. They have the
   Divine Grace of humility. In this respect, they very often excel
   others, but the other graces, the noble graces of faith and holy
   confidence and courage--these they cannot display. The beauty of their
   character is marred.

   Moreover, this woman had her enjoyment spoiled. It must have been a sad
   thing for her to go about the world bent double. She could not gaze on
   the beauties of Nature as others could and all her motions must have
   been, if not painful, yet certainly exceedingly inconvenient. Such is
   the case with the doubting, distrustful soul under infirmity. He can do
   but little. Prayer is a painful groaning out of his soul. When he
   sings, it is usually in a deep bass. His harp hangs upon the willows.
   He feels that he is in Babylon and cannot sing the songs of Zion.

   This woman, too, must have been very unfit for active service. Little
   of household duty could she perform, and that with pain. And as to
   public acts of mercy, she could take but small part in them, being
   subject to this constant infirmity. And so is it with you who are
   "Much-Afraids" or, "Fearings," you who have troubled spirits. You
   cannot lead the van in the day of battle. You can scarcely tell others
   of the Savior's preciousness. You cannot expect to be great reapers in
   the Master's harvest. You have to stay by the stuff while others go
   forth to fight. There is a special law which David made of old
   concerning those who tarried there, so you do get a blessing, but you
   miss the higher blessing of noble activity and Christian service.

   I might thus enlarge and show the likeness more clearly, but I think
   you can draw the picture for yourselves. You see the woman come into
   the synagogue and your pity is at once excited. But if you love the
   souls of men and God has made you to be tender as a nursing mother to
   others, you will pity, yet more, many of the true seed of Abraham who
   are bowed down with infirmity.

   It appears, from our Savior's words, that this woman's infirmity was
   coupled with Satanic influence. "Whom Satan has bound," He said, "lo,
   these eighteen years." We do not know how much Satan has to do with us.
   I do know that we often lay a great deal on his back which he does not
   deserve--and that we do a thousand evil things ourselves and then

   ascribe them to him. Still, there are gracious souls who do walk in the
   paths of holiness, who do hate sin, who, for all that, sometimes cannot
   enjoy peace. We cannot blame them. We must believe that the Satanic
   spirit is at work, marring their joy and spoiling their comfort. Dr.
   Watts says--

   "He worries whom he cannot devour

   With a malicious joy"--

   and doubtless that is true. He knows he cannot destroy you because you
   are in Christ and, therefore, if the dog cannot bite, he will at least
   bark. Like Mercy, in Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, you will often be
   alarmed by the evil ones and all the more so because these evil ones
   know that in a little while you will be out of gunshot of all the
   powers of Hell, and beyond the hearing of all the bellowing of the
   fiends of the Pit! Satan had much to do with this poor woman's
   infirmity.

   It appears, very clearly, too, from reading the passage, that the
   woman's weakness was beyond all human art. "She could in no wise lift
   herself up," which implies, I think, that she had tried all ways within
   her reach and knowledge. "She could in no wise." Neither by those
   mechanical operations which have sometimes been found effective in such
   diseases, nor by those medicines which were much vaunted in that age,
   could she receive the slightest relief. She had done her best and
   physicians had done their worst--and yet notwithstanding all, she could
   by no means lift herself up--and, truly, there are many in this
   condition spiritually. Have you ever been, as a Christian pastor,
   utterly baffled in dealing with some cases of spiritual distress? Have
   you ever been driven to pray, feeling the blessedness of prayer all the
   more because you have proved the futility of your own efforts to
   comfort a sin-distressed, Satan-tossed spirit? Often has that been my
   case. There has been the promise to meet the case, but the poor soul
   could not lay hold of it! There has been the cheering Word of God which
   has been efficient enough at other times, but it seemed to be a dead
   letter to this poor spirit in bondage. There has been the case, in
   point, and the experience of somebody else just like the case in hand,
   which we tried to tell with sympathy. We tried to work ourselves, as it
   were, into the position of the sufferer with whom we were dealing. But
   still, for all that, we seemed to be speaking to the winds and trying
   to comfort one who was so conditioned to sorrow that he felt that for
   him to cast off the somber weeds would be a sin, and to cease to mourn
   would be presumption. Many a time has such a case come before us and we
   have thought of this woman--and could only pray that the Master would
   put His hand upon the person, for our hand and our voice were utterly
   powerless!

   Poor soul, she had been a long time in this case! Eighteen years!
   Eighteen years! Well, that is not very long if you are in health,
   strength and prosperity. How the years trip along as with wings on
   their heels! They are scarcely here before they are fled! But 18 years
   of infirmity, pain and constantly-increasing weakness! Eighteen years
   she dragged her chain until the iron entered into her soul. Eighteen
   years! Two long apprenticeships to sorrow till she had become the
   acquaintance of grief. Yes, and some such persons, though prisoners of
   hope, are kept in bondage as long as that. Their disease is like an
   intermittent fever which comes on, sometimes, and then is relieved.
   They have times when they are at their worst--the ebb tide--and then
   they have their floods again. Now and then they have a glimpse of
   summer, but soon the cold chilly winter comes on them again. Sometimes
   they half think they have escaped and leap like the emancipated slave
   when his fetters are broken, but they very soon have to go back again
   to the jails and the manacles, having no permanent relief, still being
   prisoners year after year. I know I am describing a case which is known
   to some of you. Perhaps I am photographing you!

   Yet for all this, this woman was a daughter of Abraham. The Lord Jesus
   knew her pedigree and assured the ruler of the synagogue of it. She was
   one of the true seed of Israel notwithstanding all her failings. "Ought
   not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, to be loosened even on the
   Sabbath?" demanded the Master. Yes, and you, poor anxious spirit,
   though your faith is but as a grain of mustard seed, yet, if you have a
   simple faith in Christ, you are safe! You, troubled and tossed one,
   though your boat seems ready to be swallowed up by the waves, if you
   have taken Jesus into the vessel, you shall come safely to the land!
   Poor Heart, you may be brought very low, but you shall never be brought
   low enough to perish, for underneath there are the everlasting arms.
   Like Jonah, you may go to the bottoms of the mountains and think that
   the earth with her bars is about you forever, but you shall yet be
   brought up and you shall sing Jonah's song, "Salvation is of the Lord!"
   God does not cast off His people because of their dark frames and
   feelings. He does not love them because of their high
   enjoyments--neither will He reject them because of their deep
   depressions. Christian is dear. Father Honest is dear.
   Valiant-for-Truth, too, is dear to the King of the pilgrims! And
   Ready-to-Halt, upon his

   crutches, is equally dear, and Mr. Fearing and Miss Much-Afraid, though
   they may lie in Doubting Castle till they are almost starved, shall
   surely be brought out, for they are true pilgrims and shall at length
   safely reach the Celestial City!

   II. But we must pass on to our second point, namely that THE EXAMPLE OF
   THIS WOMAN IS INSTRUCTIVE TO ALL IN HER CASE.

   Observe that she did not tamely yield to her infirmity without effort.
   The expression, "She could in no wise l ift herself up"--an old Saxon
   form of saying, "She could in no ways lift herself up"--shows, as I
   have said before, that she had tried her best. I believe some of you
   might stand upright if you liked. I am quite certain that in some
   cases, people get into the way of surrendering to depression until at
   last they become powerless against it. Some stimulant is given them in
   the form of a sick husband, or a dying child and they grow quite
   cheerful. Under some real trouble, they become patient, but when this
   real trouble is taken away, they begin manufacturing troubles of their
   own. They are never happy, I might almost say, except when they are
   miserable--and never cheerful except when they have something to cast
   them down! If they have a real trouble, they get strength to bear it,
   but at other times, they are morbidly troubled in spirit. Now, let us
   imitate this woman and shake off our doubts and our unbelief as much as
   possible. Let us strike up the hymn--

   "Begone, unbelief, my Savor is near! And for my relief will surely
   appear. By prayer let me wrestle, and He will perform, With Christ in
   the vessel, I smile at the storm!" Let us say, with David, "Why are you
   cast down, O my Soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope you in
   God, for I shall yet praise Him." Do not so soon yield to the shafts of
   unbelief. Hold up the shield of faith and say to your soul, "No, as the
   Lord lives, who is the Rock of my salvation, my castle and my high
   tower, my weapon of defense and my glory, I will not yield to unbelief.
   Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him. And though all things go
   against me, yet will I stay myself upon the mighty God of Jacob, and I
   will not fear." The woman, then, had done her best.

   Note next, that although bent double and, therefore, having an
   excellent excuse for staying at home, yet she was found at the
   synagogue. I believe she was always found there from the fact that the
   length of time during which she had been sick was well known--not
   merely known to Christ because of His Godhead, but known as a matter of
   common talk and common knowledge in the synagogue, probably, during the
   whole of the 18 years she had been an attendant there. "Ah," she
   thought, "if I miss the blessing of health, yet I will not be absent
   from the place where God's people meet together for worship. I have had
   sweet enjoyments in the singing of the Psalms and in listening to the
   Word--and I will not be away when such Divine Grace is being
   dispensed."

   mourners, never let Satan prevail upon you to "forsake the assembling
   of yourselves together, as the manner of some is." If you cannot get
   comfort, still go to the sanctuary. It is the most likely place for you
   to get it. One of the sweet traits of character in mourners is that
   they love to go to the assemblies of God's people. I knew one aged
   woman who had year after year been in this mournful state, and after
   trying long to comfort her, but in vain, I said to her, "Well, what do
   you go to the House of Prayer for? Why don't you stay at home?" "Why,
   that is my only comfort!" she said. "I thought you told me you were a
   hypocrite," I answered, "and that you had no right to the promises or
   any of the good things?" "Ah, but I could not stay away from the place
   where my best friends, my kindred, dwell," she replied. "And do you
   read your Bible?" I asked her. "I suppose you have burned that."
   "Burned my Bible!" she said in horror. "I'd sooner be burned myself!"
   "But do you read it? You say there is nothing there for you--if you
   were to lay hold upon the promises, it would be presumption--you are
   afraid to grasp any one of the good things of the Covenant!" "Ah, but I
   could not do without reading my Bible. That is my daily bread. It is my
   constant food," she responded. "But do you pray?" "Pray! Oh yes, I
   shall die praying!" "But you told me that you had no faith at all, that
   you were not one of God's people, that you were a deceiver and I know
   not what besides!" "Yes, I am afraid, sometimes, that I am. I am afraid
   now that I am, but as long as I live I'll pray." All the marks of the
   child of God were in her private character--and could be seen in her
   walk and conversation--and yet she was always bowed down and could by
   no means lift herself up!

   1 remember a Brother minister who was the means, in God's hands, of
   comforting a woman when she lay dying in this plight. He said to her,
   "Well, Sarah, you tell me you do not love Christ at all. Are you sure
   you do not?" "Yes, Sir. I am sure I do not." He went up to the window
   and wrote on a piece of paper, "I do not love the Lord Jesus Christ.'"
   "Now, Sarah," he said "just put your name at the bottom of that." "What
   is it, Sir? I do not know what it is." When she read it, she said, "No,
   I'd rather be torn in pieces than I'd put my name to such a thing as
   that!" "Well," he said, "but if

   it is true, you may as well write it as say it." And this was the means
   of convincing and persuading her that there really was love to Christ
   in her soul, after all! But in many cases you cannot comfort these poor
   souls at all. They will still say that they are not the Lord's people,
   yet they cling to the means of Grace and, by-and-by, we trust they will
   get deliverance.

   Observe another thing, that though we are not told it in so many words
   in the narrative, we may be sure it is true, when the Lord Jesus called
   her, she came at once. She was called and there was no hesitation in
   her answer. Such speed as she could make in her poor, pitiable plight,
   she made. She did not say, as another said, "Lord, if You will, you
   can." She did not doubt His will. Nor did she imitate another and say,
   "If You can do anything." She doubted not His power. She said nothing,
   but we know what she felt. There is not a trace of unbelief! There is
   every sign of obedience. Now, Soul, when Christ does call you, by His
   Grace, make haste to run to Him! When, under the preaching of the Lord,
   you feel as though the iceberg is beginning to melt, do not get away
   from the sunlight and go back to the old winter gloom! "Make hay while
   the sun shines," says the old proverb--take care that you do the same.
   When God gives you a little light, prize it. Thank Him for it and ask
   for more. If you have got starlight, ask for moonlight. When you have
   got moonlight, do not sit down and weep because it is only moonlight,
   but ask Him for more, and He will give you sunlight, and when you have
   got that, be grateful, and He will give you yet more! He will make your
   day to be as the light of seven days, and the days of your mourning
   shall be ended. Think much of little mercies since you deserve none. Do
   not throw away these pearls because they are not the greatest that were
   ever found, but keep them, thank God for them, and then soon He will
   send you the best treasures from the treasury of His Grace.

   As soon as this woman was healed, she was, in another respect, an
   example to us, namely, that she glorified God. Her face did it. With
   what luster was it lit up! Her whole gait did it. How erect she stood!
   And then I am sure her tongue did it. The woman might well be pardoned
   for speaking this once in the midst of the assembly. Restored as she
   was, all of a sudden, she could not help telling out the joy she felt
   within! The bells of her heart were ringing merry peals! She must give
   glory to God who had worked the cure. Some of you profess to have been
   cured, but have you given glory to God? Some of you profess to be
   Christians, and yet you have never come forward to avow it! You have
   been afraid to unite yourselves with the Christian Church! Your Master
   bids you confess Him. The mode of confession which He prescribes is
   that you be baptized in His name--and yet, though He has saved you, you
   stand back and are disobedient. Take care! "That servant which knew his
   lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his
   will, shall be beaten with many stripes."

   I was, this week, by the bedside of a dying man, an heir of Heaven,
   washed in the precious blood of Jesus, I believe, and rejoicing in that
   fact, too, but yet he could not help saying, "I ought, years ago, to
   have taken my stand with God's people. You have often given me many
   hard blows in the Tabernacle, but never too hard. Tell the people, when
   you speak to them again, when they know anything is a duty, never to
   postpone it, for that Word of God is true, 'That servant which knew his
   lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his
   will, shall be beaten with many stripes.' I am not condemned, I am not
   cast away, for I am in Christ. I am resting on His precious blood and I
   am saved. But, though saved, I am being chastened." And he was sorely
   chastened with many doubts, fears and troubles of soul. If you are
   God's child, any duty neglected will bring upon your soul some
   chastisement. If you are not God's child, you may do very much as you
   like and your punishmentwill, perhaps, not come upon you until the next
   world. But if you are one of the King's favorites, you must walk very
   tenderly and very attentively, or else, as surely as you are dear to
   the heart of God, you shall feel the rod upon you to chasten you and to
   bring you back into the path of obedience!

   This woman glorified God. Brothers and Sisters, can we not do something
   more to glorify God than we have yet done? If we have done that which
   seemed to be our duty on certain occasions, may there not be yet more
   for us to do? There is very much land yet to be possessed for King
   Jesus! This wicked city is given over to sin and we are doing so
   little! Ah, some of you do what you can, but we who do what we can,
   might do more if we had more strength with which to do it--and more
   strength is to be had for the asking! Oh, that we could enlarge our
   desires for the glory of King Jesus! Oh, to set Him upon a glorious
   high throne and to crown Him with many crowns, to prostrate ourselves
   at His feet and to bring others, too, to lie prostrate at His feet,
   that He might be King in Jeshurun, King of kings and Lord of lords,
   reigning in our souls forever and ever! Imitate this woman. If you have
   been bowed down and yet restored to comfort! See that, like she did,
   you instantly fall to glorifying God.

   III. And this brings us to the last point--THE WOMAN'S CURE IS
   EXCEEDINGLY INSTRUCTIVE TO PERSONS IN A LIKE CASE.

   She went to the synagogue, but she did not get her cure alone by going
   there. Means and ordinances are nothing in themselves! They are to be
   used, but they are only dry skin bottles, without water, unless there
   is something more than these. This woman met with Christ in the
   synagogue--and then came the healing! May we, too, meet with Jesus!
   That great encounter is possible here, or anywhere, for--

   "Wherever we seek Him, He is found, And everyplace is hallowed ground."
   The great matter is to meet with Him! And if we meet with Him, we meet
   with all we need!

   Now, observe the woman's cure. In the first place, it was a complete
   cure. No part of the infirmity remained. She was not left a little
   crooked, but still much restored. No, "she was made straight." When
   Jesus heals, He heals not by halves. His works of Grace may have it
   said of each one of them, "It is finished." Salvation is a finished
   work throughout.

   In the next place, the woman's cure was a perpetual and permanent one.
   She did not return, by-and-by, by a terrible relapse, to her former
   posture. Once made to walk upright, she remained so. When Jesus sheds
   abroad life, love and joy in the soul, it is ours for a perpetual
   inheritance and we may hold it till we die, nor lose it even then!

   Notice, too, that the woman was healed immediately. That is a point
   which Luke takes care to mention. The cure did not take days, or weeks,
   or months, or years, as physicians cures do--but she was cured
   immediately! Here is encouragement for you who have been depressed for
   years. There is yet a possibility that you may be perfectly and
   speedily restored. Yet may the dust be taken from your eyes! Yet may
   your face be anointed with fresh oil! Yet may you glow and glisten in
   the light of Jesus' Countenance while you reflect the light that shines
   upon you from Him! It may happen tonight--at this moment! Gates may be
   taken from off their hinges, for the mighty Samson, whom we serve, can
   tear up Gaza's gates, posts and bars and all if He wills to set His
   captives free! If you are bound by all the fetters that self can forge,
   yet at one emancipating word from Christ, you shall be entirely free!
   Doubting Castle may be very strong, but He who comes to fight with
   Giant Despair is stronger, still. He who has kept you beneath his power
   is mighty, but the All Mighty is He who conquered at Bozrah and who
   will conquer everywhere else when He comes forth for the deliverance of
   His people! Take down your harps from the willows! Be encouraged! Jesus
   Christ loosens the prisoners! He is the Lord, the Liberator. He comes
   to set the captives free and to glorify Himself in them!

   I remind you of the thought with which we commenced this third point,
   namely, that the woman's restoration was effected by Jesus Christ, by
   His laying His hands upon her. Many of His cures were worked in this
   way, by bringing His own Personality into contact with human infirmity.
   "He laid His hands upon her." O Soul, Christ came in human flesh and
   that contact with humanity is the source of all salvation! If you
   believe in Christ, He comes a second time into contact with you! Oh,
   that your soul might get a touch of Him tonight! He is a Man like
   yourself, though He is also "very God of very God."

   In order to save us, He suffered unutterable pangs. The whole weight of
   our sin was laid upon Him, till He was bruised as beneath the wheels of
   the car of vengeance. Beneath the upper and the nether millstones of
   Divine Vengeance, the Savior was ground like fine flour! God knows, and
   God alone knows, what agonies He bore. All this was substitutionary for
   sinners. Let not your sins, then, depress you. Had you no sin, you
   would not need a Savior. Come with your sin and trust in Him! Let not
   your weakness distress you. Had you no weakness, you would not need a
   mighty Savior. Come and take hold upon His strength, for all His
   strength is meant for the weak, the hopeless and the helpless. Sitting
   on the dunghill of your sin, yet trust in Jesus and you shall be lifted
   up to dwell among the princes of the blood-royal! There must be power
   to save in God when He becomes Man to bleed and die. Nothing can be
   impossible to Him who built the world and who bears the pillars thereof
   upon His shoulders--and yet gives His hands to the nails and His heart
   to the spear! Nothing can be impossible to Immanuel, God With Us, when
   He smarts, and groans, and submits to the bloody sweat, and then
   empties out His heart's blood that He might redeem men from their
   iniquities--

   "O come all you in whom are fixed The deadly stains of sin!"

   Draw near to the Crucified! Let your souls contemplate Christ. Let your
   faith look to Him. Let your love embrace Him. Cast away all other
   confidences as mere vanities that will delude you. Away with them!
   Trust in nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ--His Person, His work, His
   life, His death, His Resurrection, His Ascension, His glorious pleading
   before

   the Throne of God for sinners such as we are! Ah, when you come to die,
   you who are strong and you who are depressed, will be very much alike
   in this matter--that you will have to come back where Wesley was when
   he said--

   "Jesus, lover of my soul,

   Let me to Your bosom flee!

   Other refuge have I none--

   Hangs my helpless soul on Thee." Look to the wounds of Christ, they
   will heal your wounds! Look to the death of Christ, it will be the
   death of your doubts! Look to the life of Christ, it shall be the life
   of your hopes! Look to the glory of Christ, it shall be the glory of
   your souls here, and the glory of your souls forever and ever!

   May God add His blessing and bring many of His bondaged ones out of
   prison! This shall be to His eternal praise! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 13:1-13.

   Verse 1. There were present at that season some that told Him of the
   Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. This
   was a matter of common town talk, so of course they brought the news to
   Jesus. Notice how wisely He used this shameful incident. You and I too
   often hear the news of what is happening, but we learn nothing from
   it--our Savior's gracious mind turned everything to good account--He
   was like the bee that gathers honey from every flower.

   2. And Jesus answering said to them, Do you suppose that these
   Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered
   such things?'"Do you imagine that there was some extraordinary guilt
   which brought this judgment upon them, and that those who were spared
   may be supposed to have been more innocent than they were?"

   3. I tell you, No, but except you repent, you shall all likewise
   perish. There would come upon them, also, because of their sin, a
   sudden and overwhelming calamity. When we read of the most dreadful
   things happening to men, we may conclude that something similar will
   happen to us if we are impenitent--if not in this world, yet in that
   which is to come!

   4. 5. Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew
   them, do you think that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in
   Jerusalem? I tell you, No, but, except you repent, you shall all
   likewise perish^. [See Sermon #408,

   Volume 7--ACCIDENTS, NOT PUNISHMENTS.] This was a foreshadowing

   of the overthrow of Jerusalem and the razing of its walls and towers to
   the ground which happened not long after. And even that overthrow of
   Jerusalem was but a rehearsal of the tremendous doom that shall come
   upon all who remain impenitent.

   6. He spoke also this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in
   his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.He
   had a right to seek fruit upon the tree, for it was planted where
   fruit-bearing trees were growing and where it shared in the general
   culture that was bestowed upon all the trees in the vineyard.

   7. Then he said to the dresser of the vineyard, Behold, these three
   years I have been seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it
   down; why let it cumber the ground?This was sound reasoning. "It yields
   nothing, though it draws the goodness out of the ground and so injures
   those trees that are producing fruit--'cut it down; why let it cumber
   the

   ground?'"

   8-9. And he answering said unto him, Sir, let it alone this year, also,
   till I shall dig about it, and fertilize it: and if it bears fruit,
   well: and ifnot, then after that you shall cut it down. [See Sermons
   #650, Volume 11--judgment threatening but mercy

   SPARING and #1451-A, Volume 25--"THIS YEAR ALSO."] He asks for a
   respite,

   but only a limited one. "After that, you shall cut it down." If, after
   the trial of another year, it shall still be fruitless, then even the
   pleader will not ask for any further respite.

   10, 11. And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
   And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen
   years, and was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself If she
   was there when Christ

   was speaking about the fruitless fig tree, I feel pretty certain that
   she said "That must mean me. I am the fruitless fig tree." But the
   Master did not mean her--He had other words and more cheering tidings
   for her!

   12. And when Jesus sawher, He calledher to Him, andsaid unto her,
   Woman, you are loosened from your infirmity. Oh, what glad news this
   must have been to her! How it must have thrilled her whole body! As she
   learned that she was to be restored to an upright position, what
   delight must have filled her heart!

   13. And He laid His hands on her: and immediately she was made
   straight, and glorified God. What expressions of fervent gratitude!
   What notes of glad exultation came from that woman's joyful lips!
   Surely even cherubim and seraphim could not more heartily and earnestly
   praise God than she did when "she was made straight and glorified God."

Noah's Eminence

   (No. 3196)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 5, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 19, 1873.

   "And the LORRD said unto Noah, Come you and all your house into the
   ark, for you have I seen righteous before Me in this generation."
   Genesis 7:1.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon, upon verses 1 and 7, is #1336 in,
   Volume 23--A FAMILY SERMON.]

   GOD keeps His eyes upon the sons of men and He searches among them for
   certain individuals upon whom He delights to fix His gaze. These are
   not the kings and princes. These are not the men of talent or of
   fashion. These are not the men who are regarded by their fellows as
   famous. When God speaks of having seen Noah, He speaks of having seen
   one of the kind of men for whom He was looking, namely, a righteous
   man. There is not a righteous man upon the earth whom God does not see.
   He may be in a very obscure position, his circumstances may be those of
   poverty, he may be anything but famous. But as long as he is righteous,
   God delights to look upon him. He looks upon him so as to take care of
   him so that if destruction is to come upon the face of the earth, an
   ark is to be prepared for the preservation of righteous Noah and his
   family. "The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are
   open unto their cry." Whoever else He does notsee, He is sure to see
   the righteous! But "the face of the Lord is against them that do evil,
   to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth."

   Now, what God delights to look upon, we should delight to look upon, so
   we will fix our mind's eye upon the righteous man mentioned in our text
   and notice, first, the eminence of Noah's character. Secondly, try to
   find out wherein that eminence consisted. And, thirdly, consider the
   gracious reward given to him because of that eminence.

   I. So, first, we are to notice THE EMINENCE OF NOAH'S CHARACTER. He was
   a righteous man in the sight of the Lord. The Lord said unto
   Noah..."you have I seen righteous before Me in this generation."

   Noah was a gracious man, one to whom the Lord had shown great favor for
   He had put Divine Grace in his heart and had given him faith, for it
   was by faith that Noah "prepared an ark to the saving of his house, by
   which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which
   is by faith." The Grace of God was within him and became the source and
   wellspring from which flowed the righteousness for which he was so
   remarkable. Divine Grace is the root of every righteous character, so
   let Grace have the honor and glory of it!

   In the Chapter preceding our text, we are told that "Noah was a just
   man." It is especially noticeable that in an age of violence and
   oppression, Noah was a just man. He was no oppressor. He dealt justly
   and fairly with his fellow men. Noah was also "perfect in his
   generations." The marginal reading is that he was "upright." He was not
   one who leaned this way for advantage, or who leaned that way for gain.
   He stood upright in conscious integrity before his fellows. Acting in
   accordance with the Grace of God which was in his heart, he had learned
   to do that which was just towards others. He was also a devout man, for
   we read that "Noah walked with God." Like his ancestor, Enoch, he lived
   in communion with God, in prayerfulness and pious meditation--and his
   life before his fellow men was in consistency with that walk before
   God.

   It is especially mentioned that Noah was righteous in that generation,
   and this is the more remarkable as that generation was so unrighteous
   and ungodly! The darker the night, the more brightly shine the
   stars--and good men are never more precious than in evil times! There
   are plenty to go the way the stream is running. When godliness is in
   the ascendant, and the Puritans rule the realm, they are Puritans, too,
   but when ungodliness comes to the front and the Cavalier holds the
   scepter, they scoff at everything that is good! Like dead fish, they
   must go with the stream--they have not the power of the living fish to
   swim against the current. They go the way their neighbors go. But Noah
   was a righteous man

   in an unrighteous generation. It may be that you, dear Friend, are
   seeking to serve the Lord among most ungodly men. Well, if it is so, be
   all the firmer for the right because of all the wrong that is around
   you! Remember how much honor it brings to the Grace of God when it
   produces a righteous Noah in the midst of an evil generation. You,
   working man, are the only one on your street who comes to the House of
   God--well, mind that you come boldly--be not ashamed of being
   different! And when, in your workshop, you hear the cursing and
   reviling of the wicked, let them know whose colors you wear and who is
   your King. But be careful that your life is so consistent that they
   cannot pick holes in it--and then you need not mind being a speckled
   bird among them, as Noah was in his generation!

   What makes the character of Noah all the more remarkable is the fact
   that he was almost alone as a righteous man. The Lord said to him, "You
   have I seen righteous before Me in this generation," as though he was
   the only righteous one in that generation! When the flood came, his
   ancestors had all passed away and the members of his own family were
   not all that they ought to have been. He practically had to stand alone
   and standing alone is not easy work. You know how we are all helped by
   the company of godly people, how good it is for us to be where the Word
   is preached with power, or where we can listen to the gracious talk of
   Christians who are more advanced in Divine things than we are. But to
   stand quite alone--to be the one white man amid a nation of aborigines,
   to be the one traveler in a land which all the inhabitants are your
   foes, to be in a community where there is no one to help you--it is
   only the Grace of God that can make a man of this sort and enable him
   to say, "If the world, itself, is to be destroyed, one honest man shall
   be found upon its surface. The Grace of God has so settled me in the
   fear of the Most High that whatever others may do, as for me and my
   house we will serve the Lord."

   But the special point about Noah's character is that we are not only
   told that he was righteous, but that he was righteous before God. The
   Lord said to him, "You have I seen righteous before Me in this
   generation." As I have turned that expression over in my mind, I have
   thought of the various tribunals before which we all have to stand. And
   as I try to take you, in imagination, before them, one after another, I
   wonder how many of you will be able to pass them all and to endure the
   supreme test so that, like Noah, you may be righteous before God?

   First of all, there is the common tribunal of ordinary society and
   public repute. I hope that without any conceit, the most of us can say
   that we believe we are reckoned as righteous by our fellow men. They
   trust us in business matters, they do not suspect us of dishonesty. We
   hope we have not given them occasion to do so. Yet, in so large an
   assembly as this, there may be some who dare not say that even in the
   opinion of their fellow men, they are righteous. And if it is so, my
   dear Hearers--if you are justly condemned by your fellow creatures--how
   can you expect to stand before the tribunal of God? If you cannot
   dispute the justice of man's verdict, you may well tremble at the
   thought of appearing before the bar of God! You are evidently
   unrighteous but oh, thank God that there is a Savior for the
   unrighteous, "for when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ
   died for the ungodly." That last word describes you--you know that you
   could not stand without a degree of shame before those who are
   acquainted with your character. Well then, fall down upon your knees
   before God--tell Him that you are sinners, but also quote Paul's
   faithful saying that, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save
   sinners." Do not be afraid to do so! Christ did not come to save sham
   sinners, but real sinners such as you are! Go to God in all your
   sinfulness, without first attempting to make yourselves better, and
   cast yourselves upon His Infinite Mercy in Christ Jesus!

   There is another tribunal a little further on. A man may have a pretty
   good character among his fellow men who do not know him intimately, but
   how does he stand in the opinion of his more immediate friends? Those
   who know us well, those with whom we constantly trade, those whom we
   meet in our daily work--our employers, our servants, our fellow
   workers--what do they think of us? If any of them think badly of you
   because you try to do what you believe to be right, you need not mind
   that, but rather rejoice that you are counted worthy to suffer for
   Christ's sake! But, on the other hand, if friends who judge you as
   favorably as they can are obliged to regard you as far from upright,
   how will you stand before the all-seeing eyes of God? Let the painful
   fact that you do not stand well before those who know you drive you to
   humble yourself before the Lord and to seek pardon and peace through
   Jesus Christ, the sinner's Savior!

   Suppose we have been able to pass these two barriers of public repute
   and our more immediate acquaintance? How do we stand in the inner
   circle at home? Occasionally, when I have spoken well of some young man
   or woman, I have been grieved to hear the parent stay, "I wish, Sir,
   your judgment had been correct. My son (or daughter) may behave very
   well before strangers, but it is very different at home." Sometimes I
   have thought a good deal of certain men whom I have met here but I have
   afterwards discovered that they had broken-hearted wives whom they had
   not treated with the love and kindness they ought to have shown towards
   them. And I have also known professing Christian women who have not
   studied the comfort of their husbands and have not made their home the
   little paradise it ought to be. If we have a good cha-

   racter in the Church, and a reputation for sanctity there, what is the
   verdict of those who know more about our private life? What is the
   verdict of the servant concerning his master? What is the judgment of
   the wife concerning her husband? What does the parent or the brother or
   sister say? I solemnly fear that there are many professors of religion
   who cannot pass this test--and I am deeply sorry when this is the
   case--for if there is any place where Christianity should be best seen,
   it is in the home circle! Rowland Hill used to say that he would not
   give a penny for the religion of the man whose cat and dog were not the
   better for it. And there is much good sense in that homely remark. I do
   not know anyone here whom this cap will fit, but if there is such a
   person, I hope he will put it on and wear it. This is the sum and
   substance of the matter--if our character cannot endure the scrutiny of
   those who are around us in our home, how can we hope to stand at the
   bar of God when all that we have done shall be published before the
   assembled universe?

   Supposing that we can satisfactorily pass that ordeal, how do we stand
   before our enemies? "Before our enemies?" asks someone. Yes, for you
   remember what was said by the jealous presidents and princes of Babylon
   concerning Daniel, "We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel,
   except we find it against him concerning the Law of his God." He was
   such a godly man that they could not find a flaw in his character
   however closely they examined him. There he stood fully clad in the
   armor of righteousness and before they could lay hold of him, they had
   to get their king to make a new law ordaining that any man who would
   pray should be cast into the den of lions. Look, too, at our Lord Jesus
   Christ when He was accused by His enemies--they brought various charges
   against Him, but they could not substantiate them. And even when they
   bribed two witnesses to give evidence against Him, even theydid not
   agree with one another as to what He had said! His life had been so
   perfect that there was nothing that could be truthfully laid to His
   charge. "Ah," says one, "that zsa test, to live so that even our
   enemies cannot truthfully find any fault in us." It is no dishonor to a
   man to be wrongfully accused--it is rather a mark of honor to have bad
   men plotting against him--but it is a subject for gratitude to God when
   one can run the gauntlet of our enemies and remain unabashed before
   their cruel, wolfish eyes! They are always on the watch for anything
   wrong or inconsistent with a Christian profession. "Well," says one,
   "that is a test that I could not pass." If so, dear Friend, remember
   this--there is no enemy whose eyes are as clear and as keen as those of
   God! Even the great archenemy could not detect a thousandth part of the
   imperfections and infirmities that lie open before the Most High! How
   important it must be, then, to be found righteous before God!

   Then, further, I wonder whether all of us who profess to be Christians
   could pass the test of being adjudged righteous before our own
   conscience. I do not mean that we should be self-righteous--God forbid
   that we should ever be that! But I mean that we should have so lived
   that our own conscience would declare that we had not been hypocrites,
   nor liars, nor deceivers, but that, through the Lord's upholding and
   restraining Grace, we had been true to our profession and had done that
   which we sincerely believed to be right. You remember how the Apostle
   John, taught of the Spirit, writes concerning this matter--"If our
   heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
   Beloved, if our heart condemns us not, then have we confidence toward
   God." [See Sermons #1855, Volume 31--what is the verdict?

   and #3152, Volume 55--THE LOWER COURTS.] Can we, all of us, pass this

   test? Happy and blessed are we if we can! But even then, we must remind
   ourselves and one another that there is a still sterner test which Noah
   was able to pass, for he was righteous before the Lord.

   II. This brings us to the second part of our subject, in which we are
   to try to find out WHEREIN THE EMINENCE OF NOAH'S CHARACTER CONSISTED.
   He was distinguished for his righteousness before God, for the Lord
   expressly said to him, "You have I seen righteous before Me in this
   generation."

   So the eminence of Noah's character consisted in this--his
   righteousness must have answered to the Divine standard. God would not
   have called Noah righteous if he had not been righteous--and we cannot
   suppose that God's standard is anything short of perfection. Then did
   Noah live a perfect life? No, speaking popularly, and as the Scripture
   often speaks, we may say that Noah's character was a righteous one.
   There must have been flaws in it and, certainly, after this time, there
   was one great sad flaw of which it is not now necessary to speak more
   particularly--still, God regarded him as righteous--and that must
   settle the question as far as we are concerned.

   Noah had the righteousness which is of faith, and that faith of his
   enabled him to look forward to Christ's Atonement. Do you ask how I
   know this? Well, when he came out of the ark, he "built an altar unto
   the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and of every clear fowl, and
   offered burnt offerings on the altar." Those sacrifices were acceptable
   unto the Lord, for He "smelled a sweet savor"--"a savor of rest"--in
   them, and they were among the many types of the one great Sacrifice
   that was afterwards to be offered upon Calvary's Cross. It was in this
   way that Noah's faith enabled him to look forward to Christ as the
   sin-atoning Lamb of God. And his faith, like that of Abraham, "was
   counted unto him

   for righteousness." God looked upon him, in Christ, as a perfectly
   righteous man--and his righteous life was the experiment and outflow of
   the inward righteousness which God had imputed to him in answer to his
   faith. He was righteous before God, and no man was ever that in his own
   naked character! Job's friend, Bildad, said concerning God, "The stars
   are not pure in His sight. How much less man, that is a worm? And the
   son of man, which is a worm?"

   I have set forth the character of Noah before you and commended it to
   the utmost. Yet I know that in the sight of God, the Patriarch's
   character was not, in itself, perfect. There must have been innumerable
   imperfections, infirmities, and faults which God's Omniscient eyes
   could see in it. How, then, could he be said to be righteous before
   God? Why, God looked at him in Christ! He became heir of the
   righteousness which is by faith, or, as Paul puts it, he was "accepted
   in the Beloved." Then, in consequence of that acceptance, he was
   "righteous" in the modified sense in which all the Lord's people are
   righteous when the Grace of God has taught them to walk uprightly and
   so made them, at least in a measure, like their righteous Father who is
   in Heaven!

   But let me add to this, in order to clear the Gospel of anything like
   legal defilement, that the eminence of Noah's character appears in the
   fact that he was righteous before God, that is to say, his
   righteousness had respect to God. When he dealt with his neighbors, he
   did not say to himself, "Now I must deal righteously with these men, or
   I shall lose my reputation as an honest, upright man." Oh, no! He dealt
   righteously with men because he desired to be righteous before God. He
   did not ask himself, "What will my neighbors think or say concerning
   the building of the ark?" His great concern was to be obedient to the
   commands that the Lord had given him and, therefore, we read again and
   again, "according to all that God commanded him, so did he." He
   fashioned his life by the will of God, not by the will of his fellow
   men, nor by his own will and, Beloved, this is the way for us to be
   righteous before God, when He brings us, by His Grace, to desire to
   live according to His will and to His praise and glory! I fear that
   many professors go blundering on, not stopping to pray, "Lord, show us
   what You will have us do." Noah did not act thus--he was righteous
   before God, righteous with respect to God, righteous in God's sight!

   I would like to have, in this Tabernacle, a band of men and women who
   will be just and fear not. Who will do the right even though all others
   are opposed to them, or though no one else shall know anything about
   it. Are any of you seeking to please men by your religion? If so, such
   religion is of little or no worth. Be not the servants of men, but the
   servants of God! Take your orders from Him and from Him alone. Do not
   shape your course and character according to the fashion of society. If
   you are truly born of God, you belong to a noble race which should
   never stoop to such degradation as that, so be righteous before the
   Lord! You have already had the righteousness of Christ imputed to you,
   so may the Spirit of God impart that righteousness to you that you may
   live unto God, and before God, fearless and careless of what men may
   say against you so long as you are right in the sight of the Most High!
   May the Lord graciously give us such a righteousness as this! And,
   Beloved, we must have it, we must have it, for without holiness shall
   no man see the Lord! Our own righteousness can never save us--we must
   have the righteousness of Christ!

   But remember that we must be purified in heart, character and conduct,
   or else, where God is we cannot go. How searching will be that test
   which we shall have to endure at the last! When we are judged by our
   fellow man, they may be deceived--but when we shall be judged by God,
   He will never be deceived. Men may accept fair words as signs and
   tokens of Divine Grace, but God will not so much regard our words as
   read our hearts! If men hear us pray, they say, "What good men they
   must be." Yet God knows what hypocrisy may be lurking behind those
   pretty sentences! Men judge us by our actions, but God can read the
   motives that prompted us to those actions. You know how righteous men
   have appeared to be in the eyes of their fellow men, yet they have
   proved to be false after all. God grant that none of us may ever be
   like that, but may we have a character that will bear holding up to the
   Light of God, a character concerning which, when the eyes of God
   examine it, He will say, "Here is truth in the inward parts. My Spirit
   has worked truth and integrity within this heart and life--this man is
   weighed in the balances, and is not found wanting." I am speaking these
   solemn words to myself, to the deacons and elders around me, and to you
   who have long professed to be Christians--not to you outsiders, but to
   the very best people here. None of us are any better than we ought to
   be and I cannot help fearing that some of us are not what we seem to
   be. Do not let us imagine that what we seem to be in the sight of our
   fellow creatures will have any weight in the judgment of God! We may be
   reckoned righteous by our neighbors and friends, but if we are not
   washed in the precious blood of Jesus, if we are not robed in the
   righteousness of Christ, if our lives have not within them the
   evidences of the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, our friends'
   favorable judgment will avail us nothing when the all-seeing eyes of
   God beholds us as we really are! I pray with all my heart that we may,
   each one of us, be righteous before God even as Noah was in his
   generation.

   III. I have no time left for dealing with the third part of my subject
   which was to have been THE GRACIOUS REWARD GIVEN TO NOAH BECAUSE OF THE
   EMINENCE OF HIS CHARACTER.

   You all know that the Lord will bless the righteous forever and ever,
   but the great question that we all have to answer is, are we righteous
   Oh, what searching sermons, what tremendous blows hypocrites will
   endure without showing a sign of feeling anything! I usually notice
   that if I preach a sermon that is more than ordinarily searching, there
   are sure to be some tender-hearted souls crying out at the close that
   they are hypocrites. Dear Creatures, I wish I had no hearers more
   hypocritical than they are! Those who take such discourses most to
   heart are often those who have the least reason for doing so, while the
   real hypocrite is no more moved by it than is the marble in our
   baptistery! I might almost point him out with my finger, for he would
   not stir--he would be as bold and brazen as Judas was when he sat with
   the rest of the Apostles just before going out to betray his Lord. Oh,
   the dreadful presumption, the terrible hardness of heart to which men
   may come! Lest this should be the case with any of us, let us, each
   one, now pray David's prayer, "Search me, O God, and know my heart; try
   me, and know my thoughts: and see if there is any wicked way in me, and
   lead me in the way everlasting."

   Let each one also pray, "Lord, let me know the truth about my case! Let
   me neither be self-deceived nor a deceiver of others! Let me know the
   worst of my case! Open my eyes even though the sight of my petition
   before you should be horrible to the last degree! Do not let me go down
   to Hell dreaming that I am going to Heaven! Let me know what I really
   am--and if my heart has never been broken, break it now! If I have
   never been washed in the precious blood of Jesus, wash me in it now!
   Jesus, the sinner's Savior, I come to You this moment. I cast my arms
   around Your Cross, O frown me not away! Look in mercy and love upon me
   and tell me that my sins, which are many, are all forgiven."

   Let the most trembling soul in this whole congregation cling to the
   Cross, crying to Him who hung upon it--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring, Simply to Your Cross I cling. Naked, come
   to You for dress. Helpless, look to You for Grace. Foul, I to the
   Fountain fly-- Wash me, Savior, or I die!"

   If we cannot cling to Christ's Cross as the sailor clings to the mast,
   let us cling as the limpet clings to the rock--and the more the devil
   tries to detach us from it, the more closely let us cling to it. Let us
   come either as saints or sinners, whichever we may be, to the foot of
   the Cross and look up at that dear head crowned with thorns and those
   blessed hands and feet and side so rudely pierced and, as by faith, we
   see the precious sin-atoning blood flowing from the Savior's cruel
   wounds, let us each one sing as we have often done before--

   "There is a Fountain filled with blood, Drawn from Emmanuel's veins And
   sinners, plunged beneath that flood, Lose all their guilty stains! The
   dying thief rejoiced to see That Fountain in his day, Oh may I there,
   though vile as he, Wash all my sins away!"

   Then, though you have not, up to now, been righteous before God as Noah
   was, you shall be so for the future! The blood of Christ and the
   righteousness of Christ shall make you so! And then a new heart and a
   right spirit shall be given to you--God's own Spirit shall be put
   within you and God shall be glorified in you even as He was in
   righteous Noah! May it be so, for His dear Son's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: GENESIS 7.

   Verse 1. And the LORD said unto Noah, Come you and all your house into
   the ark Notice that the Lord did not say to Noah, "Go into the ark,"
   but, "Come," plainly implying that God was, Himself, in the ark,
   waiting to receive Noah and his family into the big ship that was to be
   their place of refuge while all the other people on the face of the
   earth were drowned. The distinctive word of the Gospel is a drawing
   word--"Come." Jesus says, "Come unto Me, all

   you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." And He
   will say to His people at the last, "Come, you blessed of My Father,
   inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
   "Depart" is the word of justice and judgment, but, "Come," is the word
   of mercy and Grace! "The Lord said unto Noah, Come you and all your
   house into the ark"--

   1. For I have seen you are righteous before Me in this generation.
   Therefore God drew a distinction between him and the unrighteous, for
   He always has a special regard for godly people.

   2, 3. Of every clean beast you shall take to you by sevens, the male
   and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and
   his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the
   female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.Of the clean
   creatures which might be offered in sacrifice to God you see that there
   was a larger proportion than there was of the unclean, that there might
   be a sufficient amount for sacrifice without the destruction of any
   species. The unclean beasts were mostly killers and devourers of others
   and, therefore, their number was to be less than that of the clean
   species. Oh, that the day might soon come when there would be more of
   clean men and women than of unclean, when there would be fewer sinners
   than godly people in the world, though even then there would be the
   ungodly "by two" like the unclean beasts.

   4. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty
   days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will
   I destroy from off the face of the earth. It is the prerogative of the
   king to have the power of life and death, and it is the sole
   prerogative of the King of kings that--

   "He can create and He destroys." But what destructive power is brought
   into operation because of human sin! Sin must be a very heinous thing,
   since God, who despises not the work of His own hands, will sooner
   break up the human race and destroy everything that lives rather than
   that sin should continue to defile the earth! He has destroyed the
   earth once by water because of sin and He will the second time destroy
   it by fire for the same reason. Wherever sin is, God will hunt it. With
   barbed arrows will He shoot at it. He will cut it in pieces with His
   sharp two-edged sword, for He cannot endure sin. Oh, how foolish are
   they who harbor it in their bosoms, for it will bring destruction to
   them if they keep it there!

   5. And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. Here
   was positive proofof his righteousness, in that he was obedient to the
   Word of the Lord! A man who does not obey God's commands may talk about
   righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith, but it is
   clear that he does not possess it, for faith works by love--and the
   righteousness which is by faith is proved by obedience to God. "Noah
   did according unto all that the Lord commanded him," and so proved that
   he was righteous before God.

   6. And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon
   the earth. He was nearly 500 years old when he began to preach about
   the flood--a good old age to take up such a subject! For a 120 years he
   pursued his theme--three times as long as most men are ever able to
   preach! And now, at last, God's time of long-suffering is over and He
   proves the truthfulness of the testimony of His servant by sending the
   flood that Noah had foretold.

   7. 8. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
   with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of clean
   beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of
   everything that creeps upon the earth This largest and most complete
   menagerie that was ever gathered together was not collected by human
   skill--Divine Power, alone, could have accomplished such a task as
   that.

   9. There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and
   female, as God had commanded Noah. They "went in." Noah had not to hunt
   or search for them, but they came according to God's plan and purpose,
   even as, concerning the salvation which is by Christ Jesus, His people
   shall be willing to come to Him in the day of His power--with
   joyfulness shall they come into the ark of their salvation!

   10, 11. And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
   flood were upon the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in
   the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were
   all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of Heaven
   were opened. Perhaps the world was in its prime, when the trees were in
   bloom, and the birds were singing in their branches, and the flowers
   were blooming on the earth, "the same day were all the fountains of the
   great deep broken up and the windows of Heaven were opened."

   12-13. And the rain was upon the earth forty day and forty nights. In
   the same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of
   Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into
   the ark These eight persons are very carefully mentioned. "The Lord
   knows them that are His." "And they shall be Mine, says the Lord of
   Hosts, in that day when I make up"--or, shut up--"my jewels," as He was
   about to do in this case. In similar fashion,

   God makes a very careful enumeration of all those who believe in
   Him--precious are they in His sight--and they shall be preserved when
   all others are destroyed!

   14. Theey and every beast after his kind, and all thee cattle after
   their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth after
   his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort
   "Every bird of every sort," that is, every kind of bird! They are all
   mentioned again. God makes much of salvation, oh, that we also did! We
   may recount and rehearse the story of our rescue from universal
   destruction--and we need not be afraid or ashamed of repeating it. As
   the Holy Spirit repeats the words we have here, you and I may often
   proclaim the story of our salvation and dwell upon the minute
   particulars of it, for every item of it is full of instruction!

   15, 16. And they went to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh,
   wherein is the breath of life. And they that went in, went in male and
   female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him
   in. [See Sermons #3042,

   Volume 53--THE PARABLE OF THE ARK and #1613, Volume 27--SHUT IN OR SHUT
   OUT.] Now the jewels are all in and, therefore, the casket is closed!

   17. And the flood was forty days upon the earth. Just as it had been
   foretold, for God's Providence always tallies with His promises or with
   His threats. "Has He said, and shall He not do it?"

   17. And the waters increased, and lifted up the ark, and it was lifted
   up above the earth. You can see it begin to move until it is afloat.
   The same effect is often produced on us--when the flood of affliction
   is deep, then we begin to rise. Oh, how often have we been lifted up
   above the earth by the very force that threatened to drench and drown
   us! David said, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted," and
   many another saint can say that he never was lifted up until the floods
   were out, but then he left the worldliness with which he had been
   satisfied before and he began to rise to a higher level than he had
   previously attained.

   18-19. And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
   earth; and the ark went upon the face of the water. And the waters
   prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills that were
   under the whole Heaven, were covered If Moses had meant to describe a
   partial deluge upon only a small part of the earth, he used very
   misleading language! But if he meant to teach that the deluge was
   universal, he used the very words which we might have expected that he
   would use. I should think that no person, merely by reading this
   chapter, would arrive at the conclusion that has been reached by some
   of our very learned men--too learned to hold the simple Truth of God!
   It looks as if the deluge must have been universal when we read that
   not only did the waters prevail exceedingly upon the earth, but that
   "all the high hills that were under the whole Heaven"--that is, all
   beneath the canopy of the sky, "were covered." What could be more plain
   and clear than that?

   20-23. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
   were covered. Andall flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of
   fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that
   creeps upon the earth, and every man: all in whose nostrils was the
   breath of life, of all that was in the dry land died. And every living
   substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both
   man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the Heaven;
   and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah, only, remained alive,
   and they that were with him in the ark. This is the counterpart of what
   will follow the preaching of the Gospel--those who are in Christ shall
   live, shall rise, and reign with Him forever--but none of those who are
   outside of Christ shall live. "Noah, only, remained alive, and they
   that were with him in the ark."

   24. And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.

The Sweetness of God's Word

   (No. 3197)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 12, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT UPTON CHAPEL, LAMBETH, ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON, MARCH 12, 1867.

   "How sweet aire Your Words to my taste! Yes, sweeter than honey to my
   mouth!" Psalm 119:103.

   IT is delightful to find how exactly the experience of David, under the
   Jewish dispensation, tallies with the experience of the saints of God
   in these Gospel times. David lived in an age of miracles and many
   manifestations. He could have recourse to the Urim and the Thummim, and
   the priesthood. He could go up to Zion and listen to the holy songs of
   the great assembly. He could converse with the priesthood but still,
   the food of his soul was supplied to him from the written Word of God,
   just as it is with us. Now that we have no open visions and the Urim,
   and the Thummim and the priesthood are altogether departed, we still
   feed upon the Word! As that is the food of our souls, so it was the
   food of David's soul. Martin Luther says, "I have covenanted with the
   Lord that I would neither ask Him for visions, nor for angels, nor for
   miracles, but I would be satisfied with His own Word, and if I might
   but lay hold upon Scripture by faith, that shall be enough for me." Now
   it seems to be so with David here. The honey that gratifies his taste
   is not found in angels' visits, or miraculous signs, or officiating
   priesthoods, or special Revelations, but in the words of God's mouth
   and in the testimonies of Holy Writ. Let us, dear Brothers and Sisters,
   prize this Book of God! Be not ambitious, as some are, of seeking new
   Revelations, or enquire for the whispers of disembodied spirits, but be
   satisfied with this good household bread which God has prepared for His
   people! And while others may loathe and dislike it, let us be thankful
   for it and acknowledge with gratitude the bread which came down from
   Heaven, testifying to us, as it does, of the Lord Jesus, the Word of
   Life that lives and abides forever!

   I. Notice, first, THE WORD APPRECIATED. This exclamation of David is a
   clear proof that he set the highest possible value upon the Word of
   God. The evidence is more valuable because the Scripture that David had
   was but a slender book compared with this volume which is now before
   us. I suppose he had little more than the five Books of Moses, and yet
   as he opened that Pentateuch, which was to him complete in itself, he
   said, "How sweet are Your Words to my taste!" If that first morsel so
   satisfied the Psalmist, surely this fuller and richer feast of heavenly
   dainties ought to be yet more gratifying to us! If, when God had but
   given him the first dish of the course, and that by no means the best,
   his soul was ravished with it--how should you and I rejoice with
   unspeakable joy, now that the King has brought on royal dainties and
   given us the Revelation of His dear Son! Think a minute. The Pentateuch
   is what we would call, nowadays, the historical part of Scripture--and
   haven't you frequently heard persons say, "Oh, the sermon was
   historical, and the minister read a passage out of the historical part
   of the Word"? I have, with great pain, heard persons speak in a very
   depreciating manner of the histories of Holy Writ. Now, understand
   this--the part of the Word which David loved so much ismainly
   historical--and if the mere history of the Word was so sweet, what
   ought those holy Evangels and sacred Epistles to be which declare the
   mystery of that narrative--which are the honey whereof the Old
   Testament is but the comb--which are the treasures of which the Old
   Testament is but the casket? Surely we are to be condemned, indeed, who
   do not prize the Word now that we have it all!

   That Word of God which David so much prized was mainly typical,
   shadowy, symbolical. I do not know that he understand it all. I do know
   that he understood some of it, for some of his Psalms are so
   evangelical that he must have perceived the great Sacrifice of God
   foreshadowed in the sacrifices described in the books of Numbers and
   Leviticus, or it would not have been possible that he would, in so
   marvelous a style, express his faith in the great offering of our Lord
   Jesus! I put it to some professors here, do you often read the types at
   all? If, now, your Bible was so circumscribed that all was taken from
   you but the Pentateuch, would you be able, to say, "Your Word is sweet
   to my taste?" Are not many of

   us so little educated in God's Word that if we were confined to the
   reading of that part of it, we would be obliged to confess it was
   unprofitable to us? We could not give a good answer to Philip's
   question, "Do you understand what you are reading?" Oh, shame on us
   that with so many more Books, and with the Holy Spirit so plenteously
   given to guide us into all the Truth of God, we should seem to value at
   least half of the Word of God even less than David did!

   A great portion of the Pentateuch is taken up with precepts, and I may
   say of some of them that they are grievous. Those commandments which
   are binding upon us are not grievous. Some of the commands of Leviticus
   and Deuteronomy are so complex and so entrenched upon the whole
   domestic life of a man that they were a yoke of bondage, according to
   Peter, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear. Yet, that
   wondrous 20th Chapter of Exodus with its Ten Commandments, and all the
   long list of the precepts of the Ceremonial Law which you may, perhaps,
   account wearisome to read, David says were sweet to his taste, sweeter
   than honey to his mouth! What? Did he so love to hear His heavenly
   Father speak that it did not much matter to him what He said as long as
   He did but speak, for the music of His voice was gladdening in its
   every tone to him? Now that you and I know that all the bondage of the
   Ceremonial Law is gone, that nothing remains of it but blessing to our
   souls--and now that we are not under the Law, but under Grace--and have
   become inheritors of rich and precious and unspeakably great promises,
   how is it that we fall so far short and do not, I fear, love the Word
   of God to anything like the degree that David loved it?

   David here speaks of all God's Words, without making any distinction
   concerning some one of them. So long as it was God's Word, it was sweet
   to him, whatever form it might take. Alas, this is not true of all
   professors. With an unwise partiality, they pronounce some of God's
   Words very sweet, but other portions of God's Truth are rather sour and
   unsavory to their palates. There are persons of a certain class who
   delight in the Doctrines of Grace. Therein they are to be commended,
   for which of us do not delight in them if we know our interest in them?
   The Covenant and the great Truths of God which grow out of the
   Covenant--these are unspeakably precious things and are rightly enough
   the subjects of joy to all Believers who understand them! Yet certain
   of these persons will be as angry as though you had touched them with a
   hot iron if you should bring a precept anywhere near them--and if you
   insist upon anything being the duty of a Believer, the very words seem
   to sting them like a whip--they cannot endure it! If you speak of the
   "holiness without which no man shall see the Lord," and speak of it as
   a holiness which is worked in us by God the Holy Spirit and as a
   holiness of mind and thought and action--a personal holiness which is
   to be seen in the daily life--they are offended. They can say, "How
   sweet are Your doctrinal Words to my taste, but not Your precepts,
   Lord! Those I do not love. Those I call legal. If your servants
   minister them, I say they are gendering bondage and I go away from
   them, and leave them to Arminians, or duty-faith men or something of
   that kind--for I love half Your Word and only half of it." Alas, there
   are not a few of that class to be found here and there. And there are
   some who go on the other side! They love God's Word in the precepts of
   it, or the promises, but not the Doctrines. If a Doctrine is preached,
   they say it is dangerous--too high-- it will elevate some of God's
   servants to presumption! It will tempt them to think lightly of moral
   distinctions! It will lead them to walk carelessly because they know
   they are safe in Christ! Thus they, too, only love half of the Truth of
   God, and not the whole of it. But, my dear Brothers and Sisters, I hope
   you are of the same mind as David. If God shall give you a promise, you
   will taste it, like a wafer of honey, and feed on it. And if He shall
   give you a precept, you will not stop to look at it, and say, "Lord, I
   don't like this as well as the promise," but you will receive that and
   feed upon that also! And when the Lord shall be pleased afterwards to
   give you some revelation with regard to your inward experience, or to
   your fellowship with His dear Son, you welcome it with joy because you
   love any Truth and every Truth as long as you know it to be the Truth
   of God's own Word!

   It is a blessed sign of Grace in the heart when God's Words are sweet
   to us as a whole--when we love the Truth of God, not cast into a system
   or a shape, but as we find it in God's Word. I believe that no man who
   has yet lived has ever proposed a system of theology which comprises
   all the Truth of God's Word. If such a system had been possible, the
   discovery of it would have been made for us by God, Himself--certainly
   it would if it had been desirable and useful for our profit and
   holiness. But it has not pleased God to give us a body of divinity--let
   us receive it as He has given it, each Truth in its own
   proportion--each Doctrine in harmony with its fellow--each precept
   carefully carried out into practice and each promise to be believed
   and, by-and-by, received. Let the Truth of God, and the whole Truth of
   God, be sweet to our taste! "How sweet are Your words!" There seems to
   be an emphasis on the pronoun, "How sweet are Your words!" O my God, if
   the Words are Yours, they are sweet to me! Had they come to me from the
   Prophet and I had perceived them to be merely the words of man, I might
   then have estimated them at their own weight, without reference to

   their authority. But when my Father speaks--when the Spirit lives and
   breathes in the Truth to which I listen--when Jesus Christ, Himself,
   draws near to me in the preaching of the Gospel--then it is that the
   Word becomes sweet to my taste! Beloved, let us not be satisfied with
   the truth unless we can also feel it to be God's Truth! Let us ask the
   Lord to enable us, when we open this Book, to feel that we are not
   reading it as we read a common book--truths put there by some means,
   unimportant to us how--but let us recollect that we are reading the
   Truth of God put there by an Inspired pen! That we have there God's
   Truth such as He would have us receive--such as He thought it worth His
   while to write and to preserve to all ages for our instruction.

   The Psalmist is not content to say, "God's Word is sweet, and sweeter
   than honey," but, "How sweet are Your Words to my taste! Yes, sweeter
   than honey to my mouth!" After all, the blessedness of the Word is a
   matter to be ascertained by personal experience. Let others choose this
   philosophy and that form of thought. Let then gad abroad after the
   beauties of poetry, or dote upon the charms of oratory--my palate shall
   be satisfied with Your Word, O God, and my soul shall find an excess of
   sweetness in the things which come from Your mouth into my mouth!

   The Word of God, then, while in itself certainly most sweet, and all
   the sweeter when we recognize it as coming from God, will only be sweet
   to us in proportion as we are able to receive it and to feed upon it.
   Every man must in this case feed for himself. There can be no proxy
   here. I wonder not at those who think lightly of God's Word,
   notwithstanding the rapturous admiration they have heard expressed by
   others, for unless they have tasted it, and felt and handled it, they
   still must be strangers to its unspeakable sweetness!

   II. Now we shall notice, in the second place, THIS TASTE GRATIFIED.

   If we can join in the words of David here, how grateful we ought to be,
   for there was a time when we had no such taste for God's Word! A few
   years ago, God's Word was so far from being sweet to us that we thought
   it the driest book that was ever written. It is not so now. We were
   then dead in trespasses and sins--and what is honey in a dead man's
   mouth? But we are alive unto God now by Jesus Christ, being quickened
   by the Spirit. Remember, my Brothers and Sisters, how Divine Grace has
   made you to differ from the most of men. Many who see the dainties of
   God's Word pass them by. Like those poor hungry children that we have
   seen standing outside a shop where the savory meat is just within the
   window--they can see it and smell it--but they cannot eat it. Many of
   our hearers have sense enough to perceive that there is something in
   the Bible that is very satisfying and nourishing. They see it with
   their eyes, but, like the unbelieving lord in the city of Samaria, they
   taste not of it themselves. Yes, and there are some who are so far
   gone--and we were like that once--that they have no wish to taste, for
   their palate has become so depraved that they feed upon ashes, a
   deceived heart turning them aside! Like the raven which has no longing
   for the clean feeding of the dove, they are content with the carrion of
   the world. Like the swine, they are satisfied with the husks and they
   pine not to be fed with the children's bread. Such were some of
   us--utterly disregarding the Word, or seeing it to be a good thing, but
   not able to gain it, or else accounting it to be a mere deception,
   turning from it to the joys of earth as if theycould satisfy the soul!
   Oh, blessed change, Divine renewal, which has passed upon us, that now
   the Word should be sweet!

   I remember well the time when I had spiritual life and yet God's Word
   was not sweet to me. When God first gives us a spiritual taste, He does
   not make His Word sweet, but rather, if I may so say, salt or bitter.
   The first taste of the true Word of God I ever got was like Jeremiah's
   draught of wormwood. It seemed to break my teeth as with gravel stones.
   It was none other than this, "The soul that sins, it shall die." Did
   you ever have that in your mouth and have to turn it over and over
   again as a bitter morsel that you could not swallow? And when at last
   it did seem to be swallowed, it was like wormwood in your soul and
   bitterness filled every part and portion of your being, for you felt
   yourself a sinner, all undone, lost and ruined! Oh, it was a blessed
   thing when standing at the foot of the Cross, and calling upon the name
   of the Lord, you could wash your mouth clear of those bitter aloes of
   repentance and conviction of sin with the cup of consolation--the cup
   of salvation! After that first bitter draught which purged the mouth so
   Divinely and made it ready to receive the sweetness of the Word, then
   it was that on one happy day, looking up and seeing the flowing of the
   precious blood, you perceived your mouth to be filled with honey,
   instead of vinegar, for you saw the vinegar transferred to Christ and
   the gall and the wormwood given to Him, while you drank of the "wines
   on the lees," yes, "the wines on the lees, well refined."

   Since that day, our taste has been satisfied more and more, for it has
   been a growing taste. It has been educated. We can now discern between
   things that differ. On our conversion, almost everything was sweet.
   There was a good deal of false doctrine put into the cup, yet we
   swallowed it all, for to a hungry man, even a bitter thing is sweet!
   But now our

   palate has been disciplined to discern between things that differ. But
   all the education, if it is worth anything, comes to this--that God's
   Word daily becomes more sweet and man's word daily becomes more bitter
   to us. Our soul is taught more and more of Divine things and we see
   more and more of the preciousness of the Truth of God as it is in
   Jesus. Every Christian who has a spiritual taste will tell you that his
   taste is gratified with every Word of God because he sees something in
   the Word which glorifies God. My dear Brothers and Sisters, whenever
   you hear a sermon in which our God is spoken well of and His Glory is
   set before you, are you not happy? Do you not go from the place of
   worship and say, "Thank God I was there! God was in the midst of the
   temple. The Word of God was preached and my heart is satisfied"? And,
   on the other hand, whenever you hear a sermon in which man is magnified
   and the nobility of human nature is held up and God is put anywhere or
   nowhere, how do you feel about that? I am certain that you say, "That
   word which only glorifies such a poor fallen creature as man, my soul
   abhors."

   God's Word honors His dear Son! I am sure I shall touch one string in
   your hearts when I say if the preacher shall discourse of Christ--if he
   shall ring the silver bell of the Savior's precious name and lift up
   His Cross, and tell you all the power of His blood, the love of His
   heart, the shame of His death, the glory of His Resurrection, the
   prevalence of His plea before the Throne and the certainty of His
   ultimate victory over all His foes--your lips will seem as though you
   had some dainty on your palate and you will go home, and say--

   "The King Himself came near

   To feast His saints today!" How often, before you have left the place,
   have you been willing to sing with Watts--

   "My willing soul would stay

   In such a frame as this!"

   But suppose you listen to a sermon in which Jesus Christ is
   notglorified--doubts thrown upon His Deity--insinuations made about the
   power of His blood--the substitutionary Sacrifice twisted into a misty
   problem--whether an Atonement or not an Atonement, you could not
   tell--how do you feel then? Why, anything which touches Christ touches
   the apple of your eye! You say to the preacher, "Your oratory may be
   ever so fine, but I cannot eat at your table. You may lay silver knives
   and forks, and spread many a precious thing before me, but your meat is
   poison! I cannot feed if you do not glorify Christ." O Lord, this is
   the reason why Your Word is so sweet to the palate of Your children--it
   glorifies Your dear Son and they delight to see Him honored among the
   sons of men!

   God's Word is sweet, too, when it proves the Presence and discovers the
   influence of the Holy Spirit. If you hear a sermon in which the Spirit
   is worshipped and glory is given to Him as one Person in the blessed
   Trinity, the Word is then sweet to your taste! It is a mark of the
   child of God that he reverences and esteems that Spirit by whom he is
   sanctified. If the preaching is never about the Spirit of God--if He is
   systematically ignored till we can almost say, "We knew not even
   whether there was a Holy Spirit"--I do not wonder that barrenness and
   leanness should come into the souls of those who frequent such a
   ministry! The Word of God is communicated by the Holy Spirit and by the
   same Spirit it must be ministered to us. Even after His Resurrection,
   it was through the Holy Spirit that Christ gave commandments unto His
   Apostles. As it was given, so it must be received, not in words, only,
   but in power and demonstration of the Spirit-- and so shall it be sweet
   to your taste!

   Moreover, God's Word is always pure and holy. It is shocking if there
   is anything in the preaching that tends to make light of sin. Whenever
   I read a theological treatise, I can tell it is unsound if it trifles
   with the guilt of sin, the claims ofjustice, or the supremacy of the
   Divine Law. Under the pretence of magnifying Grace, some will dare to
   say that such-and-such a sin is not what it is thought to be, or not so
   heinous in God's people as it would be in others! They speak of sin in
   God's people as if it were only a spot, instead of a mortal disease.
   Oh, we have known some use expressions in the pulpit not only flippant
   and vulgar, but verging on the impure! That is enough to make the child
   of God feel like a sensitive plant when it is touched--he shrivels up.
   You never find anything like that in God's Word! There are some things
   in our common version which do not suit the common ear, and should not
   be there, because they are not necessary to a faithful rendering of the
   original--but there is nothing that will ever touch the delicacy of the
   child of God. The pure in heart can say, "How sweet is Your Word to my
   taste, because there is nothing there that can shock my sanctified
   judgment or lead me to find fault with it because of its dealing
   triflingly with sin."

   The Word of God will always be sweet to the Christian because it so
   completely quickens him to every good thing when it comes in contact
   with him. I am sure, Brothers and Sisters, when you hear the Word of
   God faithfully preached, or read it with devout appreciation, you rise
   up like giants refreshed with new wine! What would we do if it were not
   for

   the quickening which this book sometimes gives us? I must confess that
   I sometimes seem to spring up as from a bed of sloth, quickened and
   filled with more energy than I ever had before when I have been touched
   with a single promise, or the power of a single precept! I have heard
   of the dead member of an animal--perhaps the dead foot of a frog--being
   touched with the galvanic wire of the battery, and as soon as the
   galvanism flows into it, the limb has been animated by the energy. Now,
   we do not receive a galvanic energy from the Word of God, but we get
   real life from it by which we, whose souls seem to be dead, suddenly
   start up with a Divine Power! To be lethargic in heavenly things must
   always be unpleasant to the Christian. That which makes a man serve God
   with the fullest liberty and the greatest excellence is being quickened
   with the Word of God--therefore the Word of God must be always sweet to
   his taste! III. And now, thirdly, see here THE SWEETNESS EXTOLLED.

   David does not tell us how sweet God's Words are. He gives us a note of
   exclamation, the word, "How!" and there he leaves it, as though he had
   tried to fathom the depth in vain and could only say, like the Apostle,
   "O, the depth!" "How sweet are Your Words to my taste!" He tried,
   however, to give us some gauge when he gave us a comparison--"Yes,
   sweeter than honey to my mouth." And that shall be the keynote which I
   will try to strike. Why is this Word of God to us sweeter than honey?

   Honey is reputed to be the sweetest of all earthly things, yet you will
   discover that the Word of God is sweeter than that. Let me speak
   experimentally. It is a happy thing to be successful in the work of God
   and to win souls. I think that is the sweetest of all earthly
   enjoyments. I have sometimes seen 20 or 30 persons in a day, most of
   whom have found peace under my own ministry. Well, that is sweet, isn't
   it? But I am distinctly aware that the Word of God is sweeter, for when
   I have felt happy over my success, I have felt happier by far over some
   precious promise or some delightful Doctrine of Inspiration. I have
   thought I heard the Master say to me, when I had brought souls to Him,
   what He said to the disciples when they worked miracles, "Rejoice not
   in this; but rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven."
   The thought of my election, or of my redemption, or of the Glory of
   Christ, or of the faithfulness of God has been distinctly sweeter than
   the former sweetness which I had. There are things in the world that
   are very white. Some good housewives have made the linen look so
   delicately white that they have supposed that nothing could be whiter!
   And then there has come a fall of snow and, in contrast, the fairest
   and whitest damask has seemed dark! So, the joy of winning souls, the
   joy of domestic love, the joy of having served God has been like the
   damask of the housewife--but get a promise of God's Word, and in
   comparison that will be like the snow which is whiter still! All the
   sweetness you can get from earthly joy will be exceeded by the
   sweetness of an applied promise from the Word of God. It is "sweeter
   than honey."

   The Word is sweeter than honey because it will sweeten every kind of
   bitter, and there are many sorts of bitter which honey will not take
   out of your mouth. You may feel the honey striving with the bitter, and
   the effect will be a singular combination of flavor more horrible than
   the bitter itself. It is never so with God's Word. Let a man have his
   mouth full of bitter poverty, or the more bitter draught of scandal and
   contempt--ah, let his mouth be full of the last bitter draught of
   death--and if he gets the Words of God sent home to his soul, death,
   itself, shall be swallowed up in victory! In the pleasure he shall lose
   the smart! In the Divine Words of God to his spirit he shall scarcely
   know that there is such a thing as pain or grief, or even death, for
   all these things shall be gain to him when his faith gets full hold
   upon the oath and Covenant of the ever-living God!

   It is sweeter than honey, because God's Truth never cloys. You cannot
   eat much honey. If you want to like it, only eat a little of it, for if
   you eat much, you will soon come to think, 'What a weariness it is!" It
   cloys upon the palate. Not so God's Word! You may suck as you will, but
   you shall never have too much out of the breast of Scriptures. Here you
   can come and drop your bucket every morning and night, but you shall
   never draw too much from this well, whose cool depths supply an
   ever-crystal stream! Oh, come to the banquet, you hungry ones, and
   never think to rise from that table, but sit there till your souls
   shall be taken away to a table yet more richly furnished! Feast on with
   appetites whose edges are always keen. It fell to this lot of one of
   our missionaries, in translating the Word of God into a very difficult
   language, to have to read one passage over a hundred times--a very
   laborious process, if anything would exhaust the sweetness of the
   Word--but he said that after the hundredth time, he began to understand
   it. He felt, then, as if he was just beginning to read it! This is a
   pasture where the grass grows the faster the more the sheep eat of it.
   This is a mine where the gold increases the deeper your researches
   become. You may keep on eating of the Word year after year, but still
   you will never get tired of it! I suppose the most of us would not like
   to have the same thing for dinner every day. And if we are confined to
   one form of diet, we get weary of it. There are some of you who knew
   the Lord when you were 11 or twelve, and some at 15 or twenty, and I
   perceive that years have passed over your heads till you have got to be
   50 or six-ty--but do you want a new Gospel now? Would you like to have
   another form of Doctrine, another system of theology, another Cross to
   trust to, or something in lieu of the Atonement by the precious blood?
   "Oh, no," I think I hear you say, "the longer we live, the more we are
   fastened to the old faith! The deeper we study, the heavier our trials,
   the faster we cleave to Christ--

   "'Should all the forms that men devise Assault my faith with
   treacherous art, I'd call them vanity and lies And bind the Gospel to
   my heart.'"

   And, verily, the Word of God puts the mouth in taste. Some things are
   sweet in the mouth if the mouth is sweet, but if the palate is out of
   taste, you cannot get the flavor of them. But the Word of God cleans
   the mouth for you and though a man of God may find himself as much out
   of sorts as he can be, if he needs to get his mouth in proper order for
   feasting on the Word of God, he need not go anywhere else but to the
   Word, itself! The idea of preparing ourselves for Christ is not a
   Gospel idea. The idea of preparing our minds for the Gospel by thinking
   about something else always seems to me unnatural. If your minds are
   inactive, go and read a good stirring part of God's Word and that will
   prepare you for another part--for the Word will act first as a tonic to
   give an appetite and will afterwards be a food upon which that appetite
   can be satisfied!

   Yet honey, with all its sweetness, may be forgotten. But the Word of
   God, if we once know its sweetness, will abide with us forever. Let
   your child eat honey to its heart's content, yet the flavor of it will
   not be in his mouth in a week's time. So, too, have some of us retained
   the flavor of the honey we got 15 years ago. "Ah," says David, "I will
   remember You from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the
   hill Mizar." I do not know how many years that was, but some of us can
   remember times of communion and refreshing from the Presence of the
   Lord ten, fifteen, or, perhaps, 40 years ago! When Christ spread His
   flavor upon your soul, no sweetness was so sweet and you have the sense
   of it now! You like to talk of those seasons of delight, and you
   think--

   "Did Jesus once upon me shine? Then Jesus is forever mine!" Thus you
   get back the sweetness of the honey and the recollection of what you
   once knew of it.

   I gather, from what I know of God's Word, that all we know of it is
   very little. When we get to Heaven, I imagine it will be among our
   surprises to find what fools we are. When young men go to college, they
   think they know a great deal. And after the first year, they think they
   don't know as much as they did. I recollect hearing my grandfather say
   that in the second year he was at college, he thought he was a fool.
   And in the third year he knew he was, and then the tutor thought he
   might get out. That is one of the things that we shall find out in
   Heaven--"Oh, what a fool I was! I thought I knew everything." Those of
   us who preach to others will be of the same mind as Rutherford, who
   says that the poorest child who has once passed the veil and come into
   the immortal state, knows more of heavenly things than the most learned
   divine who has lived for 60 years to teach others the way of salvation.
   What we get in the wilderness is only just one bunch from Eshcol--we
   have not come into the valley where all the clusters grow. They have
   got us a little balm, and a little oil, and a few almonds from the
   land, but the land itself flows with milk and honey. "Since we have
   tasted of the grapes," we sometimes long to go--

   "Where our dear Lord, the vineyard keeps, And all the clusters grow."

   But it is amazing how little we know about it--how little sweetness we
   ever enjoy! And yet, little as it is, it is so sweet that it makes us
   hold up our hands and say with amazement, "How sweet are Your Words to
   my taste! Yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!"

   Hereby our growth in Grace may be ascertained. Is God's Word very sweet
   to me this day? Is it like honey to my mouth? Very many of God's
   children cannot say this. They can say it as a general rule, but not,
   perhaps, at the very moment of their present experience. It is a pretty
   sure sign of growth in spiritual life if God's Word is more sweet to us
   than it used to be. The sweetness of some parts of God's Word we can
   only know by being placed in circumstances where we shall understand
   the application of such-and-such a promise to our case. The man who
   never has any sickness, who has no losses in business--whose course is
   always one even stream--cannot, I am sure, understand some of the
   promises that are especially meant for the tried people of God. You
   cannot see the stars in the daytime, but I am told that if you went
   down

   a well, even in the daytime, you could see them from there. God often
   takes His people down the well of affliction and then they can see the
   stars of the promises. Some of the promises are written in invisible
   ink--and if you hold the parchment up to the fire of affliction, they
   will become visible--but till then, the page will be as if they were
   never written there at all. Now, take this promise, "When you walk
   through the fire, you shall not be burned; neither shall the flame
   kindle upon you." Why, you who never went through fires and flames can
   never know the meaning of that promise! "I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you," has often brought comfort to the tried and the
   persecuted. And the man that has been brought low in pecuniary matters,
   how often has he fed upon this promise, "Bread shall be given him; his
   waters shall be sure: his place of defense shall be the munitions of
   rocks." If you were never slandered, you never drank wine out of this
   bottle, "No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every
   tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn." I am
   sure, if you feel the sweetness of God's Word, the secret of it is that
   you have experienced something or other of trial, outside or within,
   which has distinctly brought to your soul the sweetness which otherwise
   you could not have known.

   That experience which does not make you prize God's Word is good for
   nothing. A great deal of the experience of a Christian is not Christian
   experience. He experiences it as a sinner and an offender against God.
   But that which is Christian experience always has this for its
   result--that it leads to a deeper prizing of the Word of God and a
   higher estimate of the preciousness of it. If you now have a very keen
   sense of the sweetness of God's Word, you have grown in confidence.
   Were anybody to say to me, "Honey is not sweet," I could not be very
   clear about it. Perhaps I could not argue upon the subject. But
   supposing there were a dish of honey here, and I just took a spoonful
   of it, I would say, "You tell me that honey is not sweet? Why, my dear
   man, I have got some in my mouth." I should scorn to argue upon it
   because I had the honey still in my mouth as an internal evidence and,
   therefore, argument would be too poor to be used in the case. I should
   laugh in his face when I had once got the sweetness of it on my palate.
   So it is with you. No infidel or skeptical remark can have any power
   over your mind if you are at the present moment in the conscious
   enjoyment of the comfort and sweetness of God's Word! If you feel that
   it cheers you in the dark, what a fool he must be who says that it does
   not give you light! Why, the man can have no toleration from you if he
   says it does not strengthen when you feel the strength

   of it!

   It is a sign that you have grown in spiritual health when the Word of
   God is sweet to you. I remember my father saying to us children at
   home, when we did not like our food, that he had been to the Union
   House and the boys and girls always liked their breakfast there because
   they were hungry, and, he said, "If you had to go without, it would do
   you good." Sometimes, children of God get worldly and then they have no
   appetite for God's Word. They say, "We do not profit under Mr.
   So-and-So." The truth is, we do not profit under the Bible, itself, and
   should not profit under the Apostle Paul or under the Lord Jesus
   Christ, for we have spoiled our appetites! But when our appetite is
   healthy, we can come to the Scripture and not care much how it is
   carved. We would rather the preacher would carve it well, but some
   people must have it served up always in such dainty style--it must have
   little bits of poetry, like parsley to garnish the dish, and so on, and
   if a rough hand should bring them meat, they say, "No, we cannot feed
   in this style." But if you have been in the field at work for God and
   have got an appetite, and the blood is circulating in your veins, then
   you can feast upon it till your soul rises up and says, "I thank You,
   Lord, for this, my food, and that You have made it sweet to my taste. I
   will tell my fellow Christians the delights that I have received in
   searching Your Word, that they may come and feed at the same table
   where I have been so daintily fed."

   May God the Holy Spirit make this the experience of every day to each
   one of us, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

What Christians Were and Are

   (No. 3198)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 19, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER
   23, 1873.

   "And were by nature the children of wrath, even as others." Ephesians
   2:3.

   "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the
   children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint
   heirs with Christ." Romans 8:16,17.

   [See Sermon #339, Volume 6--THE SONS OF GOD.]

   THESE two texts will furnish me with two familiar but most important
   themes--what Christians were and what they are. There are great and
   vital differences between what they once were and what they now
   are--and these are implied or indicated by the two expressions, "the
   children of wrath" and, "the children of God." There is so much
   instruction in each of our texts that we will proceed at once to
   consider them without any further introduction.

   I. So, first, let us consider WHAT CHRISTIANS WERE.

   The Apostle tells us that we "were by nature the children of wrath,
   even as others." "By nature," mark you, not merely by practice, but,
   "by nature the children of wrath" The expression is a Hebraism. When a
   person was doomed to die, he would be called by the Jews, "the child of
   death." One who was very poor would be called by them, "the child of
   poverty." So because we were, by nature, under the wrath of God, we are
   called "the children of wrath."

   When the Apostle says that we "were by nature the children of wrath,"
   he means that we were born so. David expressed what is true of us all
   when he said, "Behold, I was shapened in iniquity; and in sin did my
   mother conceive me." Our first parent, Adam, sinned and fell as the
   representative of the whole human race. "By one man sin entered into
   the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men." If any
   object to this principle of representation, that does not affect its
   truth of it--and I would also remind them that by this very principle
   of representation, a way was left open for our restoration! The angels
   did not sin representatively--they sinned personally and
   individually--and, therefore, there is no hope of their restoration,
   but they are "reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the
   judgment of the great day." But men sinned representatively, and this
   is a happy circumstance for us, "for as by one man's disobedience many
   were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made
   righteous." As we fell through one representative, it was consistent
   with the principles upon which God was governing mankind that He should
   allow us to rise by another Representative! At first, we fell not by
   our own fault, so now, by Grace, we rise not by our own merit. Death by
   sin came to us through Adam when we were born, so did life come to us
   through Christ Jesus. Thus our first text sets before us this terrible
   fact--as true as it is terrible, and as terrible as it is true--that we
   were by nature under the wrath of God from the very first. The whole
   race of mankind was regarded by God as descended from a disgraced
   traitor! We were all born children of wrath.

   This expression also implies that there was within us a nature which
   God could not look upon except with wrath The way in which some cry up
   the excellence of human nature is all idle talk. "The heart is
   deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?"
   Our Lord Jesus Christ has told us that "out of the heart proceeds evil
   thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness,
   blasphemies." Everything that is evil lurks within the heart of
   everyone that is born of a woman! Education may restrain it, imitation
   of a good example may have some power in holding the monster down, but
   the very best of us, apart from the Grace of God, placed under certain
   circumstances which would

   cause the evil within us to be developed rather than restrained, would
   soon prove to a demonstration that our nature was evil, and only evil,
   and that continually! You may take a bag of gunpowder and play with it
   if you care to do so, for it is quite harmless as long as you keep the
   fire from it, but put just one spark of fire to it and then you will
   discover the force for evil that was latent in that innocent-looking
   powder! You may tame a tiger if you begin training it early enough. And
   you may treat it as if it was only a big cat--but let it once learn the
   taste of blood and you will soon see the true tiger nature flashing
   from its eyes and seeking to destroy all that come within reach of its
   cruel claws! In a similar fashion to that, sin was originally latent
   within everyone of us and whatever better qualities God may, by His
   Grace, have planted there, it is still true that we were, by nature,
   "the children of wrath, even as others."

   I need not say any more about the original sin of Adam, or about the
   sinfulness of our nature, for those of us who have been saved know that
   our practice was according to our nature. Who can deny that the
   fountain was defiled when he is compelled to confess that polluted
   streams flowed from it? Can you look back with complacency upon the
   days of your unregeneracy? I feel sure that you cannot think of the
   sins that you committed, then, without weeping over them, and
   especially sorrowing over that sin which so many forget--the sin of not
   believing on the Son of God, the sin of so long rejecting the Savior,
   the sin of not yielding to the gentle calls of His Grace, the sin of
   bolting and barring the door of your heart while He stood outside and
   cried, "Open to Me, My sister, My love, My dove, My undefiled: for My
   head is filled with dew and My locks with the drops of the night." But
   we would not rise and let Him in! What a horrible sin it was not to see
   the loveliness of Christ and not to admire the infinitude of His love!
   Had we not been sinful by nature and by practice, too, our opposition
   or our indifference would have been melted concerning the coming of
   Jesus--and we would have at once opened our hearts to receive Him.

   Not only were we "children of wrath" by descent, by nature and by
   practice, but had not God, in His long-suffering patience, spared us
   until we were converted, we would have had to endure the wrath of God
   forever in that dark realm where not a single ray of hope or one
   cooling drop of consolation will mitigate the miseries of any child of
   wrath who hears the dread sentence, "Depart from Me; I never knew you."
   We cannot bear even to think of the doom of those who have died
   impenitent! I confess that my flesh creeps when I read those terrible
   Words of the Lord Jesus concerning the worm that never dies and the
   fire that never shall be quenched. And yet, instead of sitting in these
   seats at this moment, rejoicing in the good hope through Grace, we
   might have been there! Yes, and without any very great change in the
   order of God's Providence before our conversion, we might have been
   there! We were sick with the fever and if only the disease had taken an
   unfavorable turn, we would have been there! We were shipwrecked--and if
   only the waves had washed us out to sea instead of washing us up upon a
   rock--we would have been there! Possibly some of us have been in battle
   and as, "every bullet has its billet," if one had found its billet in
   our brain or heart, we would have been there! Some of us have been in
   many accidents--if one of them had been fatal before we knew the Lord,
   we would have been there! All of us are in jeopardy every day and every
   hour--we are constantly being reminded of the frailty of human life,
   yet God spared us, by His Grace, and did not cut us off, as so many
   others were, while we were unrepentant and unrege-nerated. Had He done
   so, we would, indeed, have been "the children of wrath" in the most
   terrible of all senses, for we would even now have been enduring the
   wrath of God on account of our sin! Children of God, as you realize the
   truth of what I have been saying to you, I trust that you will feel
   intensely grateful to the Lord who has so graciously interposed on your
   behalf and delivered you from going down into the Pit!

   Notice also that Paul says that we "were by nature the children of
   wrath, even as others." God's Grace has made a great difference between
   His children and others, but there was no such difference
   originally--they were "the children of wrath, even as others," that is,
   in the same sense as others were children of wrath. I know that God's
   children have been from eternity the objects of His distinguishing
   love, for there never was a period when He did not love those whom He
   had chosen as His own. But regarding us as sinners, unforgiven sinners,
   dead in trespasses and sins, we, "were by nature the children of wrath,
   even as others."

   We were also "the children of wrath, even as others" who remain
   unconverted. You have, perhaps, a daughter for whose conversion you
   have long prayed. You have brought her to hear the Gospel since she was
   a child, but up to the present moment, it has not touched her heart. Do
   not forget that you, also, were a child of wrath, even as she is. You
   have a friend who ridicules the Gospel, even though he comes with you
   to listen to it. Yet you were an heir of wrath, even as he is--and if
   it had not been for the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit, you,
   also, would have been only a hearer

   and not a doer of the Word. You would have been like so many others in
   this congregation and you might have said, with Cowper--

   "I hear, but seem to hear in vain. Insensible as steel."

   But you are not "insensible as steel" now! You feel the power of the
   Word. It makes you tremble, but it also makes you rejoice, for you know
   that it is the Word of your Father in Heaven who has loved you with an
   everlasting love and who, therefore, with loving kindness has drawn you
   to Himself. While you remember all this with devout gratitude to Him
   who has made you to differ from others and also to differ from what
   you, yourself, used to be, never forget that you were once a child of
   wrath, even as others still are!

   Yes, Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, you "were by nature the
   children of wrath, even as others" who still revel in sin. As you pass
   along the street you see such sights and hear such language that you
   are shocked and horrified that men and women can so grievously sin
   against the God who made them, and who still permits them to live! Yet
   do not look down upon them with an affectation of superior holiness and
   say, "What shameful sinners those people are in comparison with us!"
   But rather say, "We, too, were by nature the children of wrath, even as
   others still are."

   Yes, and to emphasize what I have previously said, "we were by nature
   the children of wrath, even as others" who pass away impenitent and in
   due time must stand before the Judgment Bar of God! They will stand
   shivering before that Great White Throne whose spotless luster will
   reveal to them, as in a wondrous mirror, the blackness of their lives
   and the guiltiness of their impenitence! And when the King sits down
   upon His Throne, even though it will be the Lamb, Himself, who died for
   sinners, who will sit as their Judge--they will cry to the mountains
   and rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sits on
   the Throne and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the Great Day of His
   wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?" There is nothing so
   terrible to look upon as injured love. Fiercer than a lion leaping upon
   its prey is love when once it is incensed. Oil flows smoothly, but it
   burns furiously--and when the love of Jesus has been finally
   rejected--then the sight of Him whose head was once crowned with thorns
   will be more terrifying than anything else to the eyes of those who
   have rejected Him. They will wish they had never been born and, indeed,
   it would have been better for them if they had never had an existence!
   Had it not been for the Grace of God, their portion would also have
   been our portion, for by nature we were the children of wrath even as
   they were--and amidst that shivering, trembling crowd we would have
   taken our station. But, believing in Jesus, our place shall be at His
   right hand "when He shall come to be glorified in His saints and to be
   admired in all them that believe." We shall be among those to whom the
   King will then say, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the
   Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Yet, by
   nature, we were "the children of wrath, even as others."

   II. Now I must turn from that sad, solemn knell--"Children of wrath,
   even as others," to the joyous peal that rings out from our second text
   which tells us WHAT CHRISTIANS ARE--what we now are if we have believed
   in Jesus-- "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we
   are the children of God."

   It is such a wonderful thing that those who were the children of wrath
   should now be the children of God and that there are two witnesses to
   it. First, our own spirit says that we are the children of God and then
   the Holy Spirit comes and says, "Yes, and I also bear witness that you
   are the children of God."

   Now, Beloved, do you realize that God has worked this great miracle of
   mercy in you? Does your spirit bear witness that you are now a child of
   God When you go out of this building and look up at the stars, will you
   say to yourself, "My Father made them all"? Will you feel that you must
   talk to your Father? And when you go to your bed tonight, should you
   lie sleepless, will you begin to think of your heavenly Father as
   naturally as a little child, when it lies awake in the dark, thinks of
   its mother and calls to her? If you are a true Believer, this is the
   case with you. The Spirit of adoption is given to you by which you are
   enabled to cry, "Abba, Father." Do you not also know what it is,
   sometimes, when you are sitting down quietly by yourself, to think,
   "The God who made the heavens and the earth, and who upholds all things
   by the Word of His Father, is my Father"? Then very likely a flood of
   tears will come as you stand silently before the Lord just as the
   lilies do, for at times there is no form of worship that seems possible
   to our joyous spirit except standing still and letting the love of the
   heart silently breathe itself out before the Lord like the fragrance of
   flowers ascending in a gentle breeze. In such a frame of mind as that,
   your spirit may well bear witness that you are a child of God!

   Then comes the Holy Spirit, the Infallible Witness, and through the
   Word and through His own mysterious influence upon our heart, He bears
   witness that we are the children of God. Two witnesses were required,
   under the Law of God, to establish a charge that was made against any
   man. And under the Gospel, we have two witnesses to establish our claim
   to be the children of God--first, the witness of our own spirit--and
   then the second and far greater Witness, the Holy Spirit, Himself! And
   by the mouth of these two witnesses shall our claim be fully
   established. If our own spirit were our only witness, we might hesitate
   to receive its testimony, for it is fallible and partial. But when the
   Infallible and impartial Spirit of God confirms the unfaltering witness
   of our own heart and conscience, then may we have confidence toward God
   and believe without hesitation that we are, indeed, the children of the
   Most High God! One of the points on which the Holy Spirit bears witness
   with our spirit that we are the children of God is this--"We know that
   we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren." When
   we really love those who are God's children, it is strong presumptive
   evidence that we are, ourselves, members of His family! And when we
   truly love God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit--when we
   have a compassionate love to the souls of men and an intense love of
   holiness and hatred of sin, and desire for God's Glory--all these are
   the further witness to the Spirit with our spirit that we are the
   children of God.

   Then, as there are two witnesses that we are the children of God, so
   are there two ways in which we become the children of God.

   First, we are the children of God by adoption. When God asked Himself
   the question, "How shall I put the children of wrath among My
   children?" He answered Himself by saying, "I will do it by adopting
   them into My family." We were far off from God by wicked works, "aliens
   from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of
   promise, having no hope, and without God in the world." Yet, by the
   Grace of God, we have been adopted into the Divine family!

   Now you know that a child may be adopted into a nobleman's family, and
   yet he will not really be one of the nobleman's kindred. So there is a
   second way in which we become the children of God, that is, by
   regeneration. We are born into the family of God as well as adopted
   into it, and thus we become "partakers of the Divine Nature." So Peter
   writes, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
   according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively
   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an
   inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away,
   reserved in Heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through
   faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time." Adoption
   gives us the privilegesof the children of God. Regeneration gives us
   the Nature of the children of God! Adoption admits us into the Divine
   family. Regeneration makes us akin to the Divine Father--it creates us
   anew in Christ Jesus and puts into us a spark from the eternal Spirit,
   Himself, so that we become spiritual beings. Before regeneration, we
   are only body and soul--but when we are born-again, born from above--we
   become body, soul and spirit. Being born of the Spirit, we understand
   spiritual things and have spiritual perceptions which we never
   possessed before.

   Becoming the children of God, we are entitled to all the privileges of
   childhood. It is the privilege of a child to enjoy its father's love,
   its father's care, its father's teaching, its father's protection, its
   father's provision and last, but by no means least, its father's
   chastening. Whatever a child receives as its right from its father, we
   also receive from our Father who is in Heaven. "If you, then, being
   evil, know how to give good gifts to your children; how much more shall
   your heavenly Father give to you who are His children every blessing
   that you can possibly need while you are here on earth, and Heaven
   itself to crown it all?"

   Then the Apostle further says, "and if children, then heirs; heirs of
   God, and joint heirs with Christ." Now, in this country, it is not
   always true that, if children, then heirs, because we have laws, (of
   which some may approve, though I fail to see the justice of them),
   which make one son to be the heir just because he happens to be the
   first-born. It is not so in God's family! It is, "if children, then
   heirs," that is to say, all the children in the Divine family are God's
   heirs! The last one who ever will be born into the family of God will
   be as much an heir as the first who said, "My Father, who are in
   Heaven." And the least of the children of God--Little-Faith,
   Ready-to-Halt and Miss Much-Afraid, are just as much the heirs of God
   as Faithful, Valiant-for-Truth and Mr. Great-Heart, himself! "If
   children," that is all, "if children, then heirs." Are they true-born
   children of God? Have they the faith which is the characteristic mark
   of all who are in God's family? Are they truly converted? Have they
   been born-again, born into the family of God? If so, then it follows of
   neces-

   sity that, "if children, then heirs." Does not this Truth of God
   encourage poor Miss Despondency over there, and you, Mr. Fearing, and
   friend Little-Faith over yonder?" If children, then heirs." Not, "if
   big children," nor, "if first-born children," nor, "if strong
   children," but simply, "if children, then heirs"! If you have received
   the Spirit of adoption, whereby you cry, "Abba, Father," you are an
   heir of God and a joint heir with Jesus Christ!

   There is another remarkable thing in the family of God. If we, who were
   by nature the children of wrath, become by Grace, the children of God,
   we thereby become, all of us, the heirs of all that God has! Now, this
   can never happen in an earthly family. If the father were rich and all
   his children were his heirs, one son would have one farm and another
   son would have another farm. And each of the girls would have so many
   thousands of pounds for her dowry, but each one of them could not have
   all that there was--it would have to be divided between them--one would
   have what the others had not, and could not have anything that they
   had. But, in God's family, all the children are heirs of all that is
   His. My dear Brother or Sister in Christ, if you have a choice
   privilege that is yours because you are a Christian, I rejoice that you
   have it, but I have it, too! And if I have a precious promise that
   belongs to me because I am one of the Lord's children, you may be
   thankful for it, for it belongs equally to you! No child of God can
   keep Christ all to himself, for He is the portion of all His people!
   Some dear brethren whom I know would like to plant a very prickly hedge
   around their little gardens, so as to keep all their Christian
   privileges to themselves--but God's birds of paradise can fly over
   those hedges and share in all the good things they are intended to
   enclose!

   "If children, then heirs, heirs of God." You, my dear Brother or
   Sister, have Christ, and I have Christ! You have the Spirit, and I have
   the Spirit. You have the Father, and I have the Father. You have
   pardon, you have peace, you have the righteousness of Christ, you have
   union with Christ, you have security in life, you have safety in death,
   you have the assurance of a blessed resurrection and of eternal glory,
   but so have all those who have believed in Jesus! There is the same
   inheritance for all the children of God--not a part for one, and
   another part for another. The Covenant is not, "Manas-seh shall have
   this portion of the promised land, and Issachar that portion, and
   Zebulun that other portion." But to every Believer the Lord says, "Lift
   up now your eyes to the North, and to the South, to the East, and to
   the West, for all this goodly heritage have I given to you by a
   Covenant of salt forever."

   There is another thing about this inheritance that makes it still more
   precious to us, and that is that everyone of the heirs shall certainly
   inherit it--and that is more than you can say about any earthly
   inheritance. If you know that somebody has made a will in your favor,
   do not reckon that the estate or money is really yours until you are
   actually in possession of it, for "there is many a slip 'twixt the cup
   and the lip." The will may be revoked and the new one may leave you
   out, or there may be a flaw in it so that the estate will get into
   Chancery, and remain there for the term of your natural life. Even if
   there is no doubt that you are the heir, there may be many who will
   dispute your right to the inheritance. But if you are really a child of
   God, not even the devil, himself, shall be able to rob you of your
   heavenly inheritance! Satan may deny that you are an heir of God, but
   your heavenly Father will say, "Yes, he is, indeed, My child, and heir
   to all I have. I remember his first tear of penitence and I have
   preserved that in my bottle. I remember his first true prayer, his
   first look of faith, his first note of praise--they are all registered
   in My records that none can erase. I have his name here in the Book of
   Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, and it can
   never be blotted out! Yes, he is My child and My heir--all that I have
   belongs to him." There is a day coming when all Christ's sheep shall
   pass again under the hand of Him that counts them--and in that day, not
   one of the whole redeemed flock shall be missing! As the long roll of
   God's ransomed family is called, it shall be asked, "Is Little-Faith
   here?" And he will answer to his name not at all in the trembling way
   in which he used to speak when he was upon earth. When it is asked, "Is
   Miss Much-Afraid here?" she will reply, in jubilant tones, "Glory be to
   God, I am here!" No matter how weak and feeble you may be, if you are a
   child of God, you shall certainly be there and the inheritance shall
   assuredly be yours!

   I have not yet done with this expression, "heirs of God." Paul does not
   say that the children of God are heirs of Heaven. Our inheritance is
   much bigger than that, for Heaven has its bounds, but God has none.
   Heaven and earth shall pass away, but God never will! We are heirs,
   therefore, of unending bliss, for we are "heirs of God." There is no
   one here, there is no one on earth, there is no man or angel in Heaven
   who can tell the full meaning of this expression, "heirs of God." The
   words are simple enough for even a child to utter, but only God fully
   understands what they mean. And we shall go on learning throughout
   eternity all that is included in those three short words. To have God
   Himself as our inheritance, to be able to say, "The Lord is my
   portion," is a thousand heavens in one! And all the children of God are
   the heirs of God--no one of them will ever have to say, "My portion
   will have to be stinted because my elder brother has taken such a large
   share"--but everyone shall have God to enjoy here on earth, and then to
   enjoy forever in Heaven!

   Finally the Apostle says, "and joint heirs with Christ." It always adds
   to our enjoyment of any pleasure if we have someone whom we greatly
   love to share it with us. Then how much more shall we enjoy our
   heavenly inheritance because we are to occupy it with Christ Jesus, our
   Lord and Savior, to whose Incarnation, life, death, Resurrection and
   intercession we are indebted for it all! Oh, who would not be a child
   of God, to have such bliss forever and to enjoy it in such blessed
   Company? Yet is there anyone here who despises his inheritance? Is
   there anyone here like Esau, "who for one morsel of meat sold his
   birthright," and who, "afterward, when he would have inherited the
   blessing, was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he
   sought it carefully with tears"? Is there someone here who was once a
   professor of religion, who has gone back to the world in the hope of
   getting a better living or a little praise among men? Poor Soul, pour
   Soul, how I pity you! But, O child of God, have you been kept faithful
   even to this hour? Then let Naboth rather than Esau be your model! Ahab
   offered Naboth a better vineyard than his own, or the worth of it in
   money if he would sell it, but he would neither exchange nor sell his
   inheritance even though his refusal to do so cost him his life-- and it
   would be better for us to die a thousand deaths than to think of
   parting with our heavenly inheritance! Happily, if we are really the
   children of God, He who has, by His Grace, made us His children, will
   keep us His children! And He will both keep us for the inheritance and
   keep the inheritance for us!

   There is, however, such a danger of being only children of God in name,
   and not in truth, that we shall all do well to give heed to the
   Apostle's warning, "Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us
   of entering into His rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."
   Having put our hand to the plow, let us not even thinkof looking back,
   but may we be proved to be the living children of the living God by
   walking in His ways until we come into His blessed Presence to go no
   more out forever for His dear Son's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: EPHESIANS2.

   Verse 1. And you has He quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
   sins. [See Sermons #127, Volume 3--spiritual resurrection; #2267,
   Volume 38--LIFE FROM THE DEAD and #2388, Volume 40--ONCE DEAD, NOW
   ALIVE.] Then you owe your very life to Him! You were dead, you were
   like a corrupt carcass, but His life has been breathed into you. "You
   has He quickened." Then you are no longer dead--you are a living soul
   before the living God--and as you owe this to Him, praise Him with all
   the life you have! You "were dead in trespasses and sins." 2, 3.
   Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world,
   according to the prince of the power of

   the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:
   among whom we, also, all had our conversation in times past in the
   lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the
   mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.It does
   us good to remember what we used to be. There was no reason in us, by
   nature, why we should be made the children of God. There were in us no
   distinguishing traits of character by which we were separated from our
   fellow sinners. We ran in the same course. We were possessed by the
   same spirit. We worked the same works. We had the same nature. We were
   under the same condemnation--"children of wrath, even as others."

   4, 5. But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He
   loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together
   with Christ, (by Grace you are saved). [See Sermons #2968, Volume
   52--"his great love"; #805, Volume 14--

   RESURRECTION WITH CHRIST and #2741, Volume 47--SALVATION BY GRACE.]

   "By Grace you are saved." I know that you feel that it is so. Our
   quickening out of our death in sin must have been by Grace--and as God
   has done it--unto Him must be ascribed all the glory of it! There can
   be no merit in those who are dead in sin that they should be quickened
   out of their sin! This must be the work of the Lord, alone, and unto
   Him be all the praise. He "has quickened us together with Christ," so
   that our life is mystically linked with the life of Christ, as He said
   to His disciples, "Because I live, you shall also live." Until He can
   die, those who are one with Him cannot die.

   6. And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly
   places in Christ Jesus.It is all in Him and it has a sevenfold
   sweetness about it because it is in Him. To live unto God is a wondrous
   mercy, but to live togetherwith Christ is an unspeakable honor! To be
   raised up into the heavenly places would be a surpassing blessing, but
   to be raised

   up there together with Christ, and to be made to sit there with Him, is
   a gift that is above the superlative! I know not how else to speak of
   it.

   7. 8. That in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of
   His Grace in His kindness toward us through

   Christ Jesus. For by Grace are you saved through faithl. [See Sermons
   #1064, Volume 18--SALVATION ALL OF GRACE and #1609, Volume 27--
   FAITH--WHAT IS IT? HOW CAN IT BE OBTAINED?] It must be all of Grace

   because of the greatness of the favor bestowed. A man dead in
   trespasses and sins cannot deserve to be made alive. And when he is
   made alive, he cannot deserve to be raised up to sit with Christ in the
   heavenly places! That is too great a gift to come to us by the way of
   the Law--it must come to us emphatically as the gift of the Grace of
   God in Christ Jesus! "For by Grace are you saved through faith"--

   8. And that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. "Not of
   yourselves." What do those people mean who keep on crying up the power
   of the human will, the wonderful dignity of human nature and all that
   kind of foolish talk? Salvation is not of ourselves! "It is the gift of
   God," not a reward which we have earned, but a free gift which God
   bestows according to the riches of His Grace!

   9. Not of works, lest any man should boast.God will not have a boaster
   in Heaven! He will not have the creature exalting himself in His
   Presence. The command, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of
   the earth." is backed up by this reason, "for I am God, and there is
   none else." Therefore unto God, Himself, must be the praise and glory
   for all who are saved.

   10. For we are His workmanship. [See Sermons #1829, Volume 31--THE
   SINGULAR ORIGIN OF A CHRISTIAN and #2210, Volume 37--THE AGREEMENT OF
   SALVATION BY GRACE WITH WALKING IN GOOD WORKS] Salvation cannot be of
   works, for if we have any good works, it is because we are God's
   workmanship.

   10-12. Created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before
   ordained that we should walk in them. Therefore remember that you being
   in time past, Gentiles in the flesh--who are called Uncircumcision by
   that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh by hands--that at
   that time you were without Christ Certainly we were poor sinners of the
   Gentiles, having no participation whatever in the old Mosaic
   dispensation.

   12. Being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel For us there was no
   paschal lamb, for us there was no high priest at Jerusalem, no altar
   smoked with a sacrifice for us--we were "aliens from the commonwealth
   of Israel"--

   12. And strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and
   without God in the world. That is where the whole Gentile world stood!
   And this is experimentally where you and I stood till Sovereign Grace
   interposed for our salvation. What knew we about the Covenants of
   promise? We knew nothing and we did not care to know anything! What did
   we know about a hope? We would have died without a hope if God's mercy
   had not come to us! What knew we, or what cared we about a God in the
   world? We may have thought that there was a God in Heaven, but as
   actually operating upon the daily life of man, we knew no such God! We
   were "without God in the world."

   13. But now. Oh, what a blessed, "but"! How much hangs upon it! Think
   of what God has done for you by His Grace! "But now"--

   13. In Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the
   blood of Christ. What a power there must be about that

   blood--that God not only hears it speaking in Heaven, that it makes a
   way of access for all the saints, that it cleanses from all sin--but
   that it brings the far-off ones near! We will never cease to speak of
   the precious blood of Jesus! There are certain people who cannot bear
   to hear it mentioned, but a bloodless theology is a lifeless theology,
   and a ministry that can do without mentioning the blood of Christ has
   no power to bless the sons and daughters of men.

   14. For He is our peace. We find in Christ, peace with God, peace with
   our own conscience, peace with all mankind!

   14. Who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of
   partition between us.So making Jews and Gentiles one--

   15. Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the Law of
   Commandments contained in ordinances; so as to create in Himself one
   new man from the two, so making peace. Our Lord Jesus Christ was a Jew,
   yet I venture to say that there was nothing Jewish about Him. He was
   the model of what man ought to have been and His words and His actions
   made Him worthy to be called cosmopolitan. He belongs to all mankind.
   He is the Man in whom all races are summed up!

   And when we come to Christ, there is a link between us and the ancient
   people of God. I do not care about Anglo-Israelism, what I care for is
   Christo-Israelism--to belong to the Israel of God in Christ Jesus!

   16-17. And that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the
   Cross, having slain the enmity thereby; and came and preached peace to
   you which were afar off, and to them that were near Christ is the
   Preacher of peace as well as the Maker of peace--and no man ever knows
   the peace of God unless Christ preaches it to him.

   18, 19. For through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
   Father Now therefore--Here is another sweet "now."

   19, You are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with
   the saints, and of the household of God. A part of the family of the
   great Householder, even God! Citizenship is well enough in its place,
   but citizens do not always know one another. But we are of the
   household of God--we are brought into an intimate relationship with one
   another through our Elder Brother who makes us to be the children of
   the great Father in Heaven!

   20, 21. And are built upon the foundations of the Apostles and
   Prophets, Jesus Christ, Himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all
   the building fitly framed together grows unto an holy temple in the
   Lord. We are put so close together, if we are really in Christ, that we
   are like the stones of the temple--so united as to become one. In
   Christ Jesus our union is not only that of relationship, but we enter
   into a perfect unity with one another and with the Lord.

   22. In whom you also are being built together for an habitation of God
   through the Spirit. That is the most wonderful

   Truth of all--that God Himself should come and dwell among His people
   and in His people, and that, being sanctified by Grace, we become the
   dwelling place of the Most High! God grant that it may be so! Amen.

How the Lambs Feed

   (No. 3199)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, MAY 26, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then shall the lambs feed in their pasture." Isaiah 5:17.

   THE sense of this passage may be that Judea would be so desolated that
   it would become rather a wild wilderness pasture for flocks than an
   inhabited country. But that is not the meaning which the old readers of
   the Bible were accustomed to give to it. The Hebrew commentators
   considered "the lambs" to mean the house of Israel and regarded this as
   a promise that in all times of distress and affliction, God's flock
   would still be fed--there would still be a people kept alive and these
   should still meet with suitable support. Whether that is the correct
   sense or not, I shall use the words as having some such meaning.

   Our text deals with the lambs, and to the lambs we intend to speak--may
   the Good Shepherd speak to them also! Young converts, newborn souls,
   these words are for you--you shall feed in your pasture.

   I. Our first observation is that GOD WOULD HAVE ALL HIS CHURCH FED--a
   simple enough observation, certainly, and clearly to be inferred from
   the common course of nature, for no sooner is any living thing created
   than there are appliances for its feeding. No sooner is a seed cast
   into the ground and vitalized than it gathers to itself the particles
   upon which it feeds. And no sooner is an animal born than it receives
   food. Surely the Lord does not create life in the regenerated soul
   without providing stores upon which it may be nourished! Where He gives
   life, He gives food.

   Simple as this statement is, it has often been forgotten by those who
   should best have borne it in mind. It strikes me that it has been
   forgotten by some ministers. They have exhorted, threatened and
   thundered, but they have never fed those to whom they have preached!
   They have cried, "Believe! Believe!" but seldom explained what was to
   be believed, or, when they have mentioned the simple elements of the
   faith, they have gone no further, but have continued to speak the first
   principles of the Gospel and no more. These Brothers have their proper
   sphere, but they should not be pastors unless they can feed the flock
   of God! The wanderers must be gathered first, but afterwards they must
   be fed. For lack of this, many have remained in weakness and
   bondage--and have made no advance in the Divine Life. The necessity for
   spiritual food has been forgotten by some ministers who have
   continually harped upon the sublime Doctrines of the Gospel, but have
   not preached the elementary Truths of God. Surely they have not carried
   out their Lord's command, "Feed My lambs." They have been content to
   feed the older people, who by reason of use have had their senses
   exercised, forgetting that the same necessities befall all the flock
   and that the lambs need to be fed as well as the sheep.

   If the teachers have forgotten this, the taught have also failed to
   remember it. I have been very anxious, Beloved, that you should be
   diligent in the service of God and I have continually stirred you up,
   not to be sitting listening to sermons when you ought to be doing
   good--and the consequence has been that some have gone forth to attempt
   to do good whom I should not have exhorted to do so--for them it would
   have been better if they had waited a while, till they had learned
   somewhat more, both of Doctrine and experience. Young Brothers, there
   is a time for feeding as well as a time for working. There is work for
   strong men and there is nurture for babes. To little children we do not
   allot the labors of husbandry--some little service in the house is
   suitable for them and will do them good--but we do not exact much labor
   from them, for we know that youth is a time in which they must be
   learning and growing. Therefore let me say to some of you who know
   little or nothing of your Bibles, or of your own hearts--Wait a little,
   and run not before you are sent. Sit, young Brother, a while at Jesus'
   feet and learn what He has to say to you. Then, when you run as a
   messenger, you will have a message, whereas, perhaps, you now have more
   foot than heart, more tongue than brain, and this is dangerous!

   Let us not forget that our souls need to be fdand this I say to some of
   you who do but little for the Lord Jesus, and may be said neither to
   work nor to eat. Look at the mass of our Christian people, what do they
   do? Monday morning early at business and on till Saturday evening late
   at business! What is their reading? The daily paper! I condemn it not,
   but of what use is this to their souls What, then, do they read to
   nourish the inner life? Ah, what? A magazine with a religious tale in
   it! A tale which will probably be spun out to two or three volumes! If
   the religion were taken out of it, it would probably be improved--and
   if the rest of the book were burned, some light might come of it--but
   none comes by reading it! I will not judge severely, but what is the
   reading of many Christians? Is it food for their souls? And beyond
   reading, what else are they doing that their spirits may be nourished?
   Our fathers would go into their chamber three times a day and take a
   quarter of an hour for meditation--how many of us maintain such a
   habit? Is it done once a day? It was once my privilege to live in a
   house where, at eight o'clock, every person, from the servant to the
   master, would have been found for half an hour in prayer and meditation
   in his or her chamber. As regularly as the time came round, that was
   done, just as we partook of our meals at appointed hours. If that were
   done in all households, it would be a grand thing for us! In the old
   Puritan times, a servant would as often answer, "Sir, my master is at
   prayers," as he would nowadays answer, my master is engaged." It was
   still looked upon as a recognized fact that Christians did meditate,
   did study the Word, and did pray--and society respected the interval.
   It is said that if in the days of Cromwell, you had walked down
   Cheapside in the morning, you would have seen the blinds down at every
   house at a certain hour. Alas, where will you find such streets
   nowadays? I fear that what was once the rule is now the exception! When
   will God's people perceive that it is not enough to be born-again, but
   that the life then received must be nourished daily with the Bread of
   Heaven? It is not enough to be spiritually alive--our life, to be
   vigorous--must be familiar with its Source! Every Christian should know
   that he needs times for supplying his soul with the food which endures
   unto life eternal. As the body needs its mealtimes, so must you sit
   down to your heavenly Father's table until He has satisfied your mouth
   with good things and renewed your strength like the eagle's. The more
   intensely earnest we are in feeding upon the Word of God, the better!

   My young Friends, you require to be fed with knowledge and
   understanding and, therefore, you should search the Scriptures daily to
   know what are the Doctrines of the Gospel, and what are the glories of
   Christ. You will do well to read the "Confession of Faith," and study
   the proof texts, or to learn the "Assembly's Catechism," which is a
   grand condensation of Holy Scripture. I would say, even to many aged
   Christians, that they could not spend their time better than in going
   over the Shorter Catechism again and comparing it with the Book of God
   from which it is derived. Truly, in these days, when men are so readily
   decoyed to Popery, we had need know what it is that we believe!
   Protestantism grew in this land when there was much simple, plain,
   orthodox teaching of the Doctrines which are assuredly believed among
   us. Catechism was the very bulwark of Protestantism. But now we have
   much earnest preaching and yet people do not know what the doctrines of
   the Gospel are--be you not ignorant, but be you nourished up in the
   Truth of God!

   My young Friends, may you obtain a spiritual understanding of God's
   Word which is more than knowledge! May you discern the inward sense,
   compare spiritual things with spiritual, and see the relation between
   this Truth and the other, and the relation of all Truths of God to
   yourselves and to your standing before God! May the Holy Spirit feed
   you so! May you also be fed by mingling with the saints of God and
   learning from their experience! Many a young Christian gathers from
   advanced saints what he would never discover elsewhere. As they tell of
   what they have felt, and known, and suffered, and enjoyed, the lambs of
   the flock are strengthened and consoled. Seek for your companions those
   who can instruct you! It is a dreary thing for a young man to have
   association with those only who are below himself in experience and not
   to know those from whose lips drop pearls because they have been in
   those deeps where pearls are found. Be much with experienced Christians
   who have been with Jesus, and you will be fed by them!

   Young Friend, much feeding will come to you by meditation on the Truth
   that you hear. As the cattle lie down and chew their cud, so does
   meditation turn over the Truth of God, and get the very essence and
   nutriment out of it. To hear, and hear, and hear, and hear, as some do,
   is utterly useless because when they have heard, it is all over with
   them--it has gone in one ear and out the other--and has left nothing
   upon the mind. Press the Truth of God as men tread the grapes in the
   wine vat, filing the red clusters into the press of memory, and trample
   on them with the feet of meditation--then shall the rich juice flow
   forth to cheer your heart and make your spirit strong within you!
   Meditate, young man and maiden! This is the thing you need if you would
   be fed.

   And, higher still, there is a Divine nourishment in Communion when the
   soul ascends to Jesus Christ and feeds on the Lord, Himself--when the
   Incarnate God becomes the soul's Bread and the bleeding Savior in His
   substitutionary Sacrifice, becomes the heart's wine. Feed on Him, O
   Beloved, you who have lately come to Him! Eat, yes, drink abundantly, O
   Beloved! May the Lord give you a mighty hunger after His Word, after
   Himself and then lead you by the still waters, and make you to lie down
   in green pastures!

   Thus much on the first simple fact--that God will have all His sheep
   and His lambs fed.

   II. Secondly, the text says that the lambs shall feed "in their
   pasture," and that leads us to observe that YOUNG BELIEVERS HAVE THEIR
   OWN WAY OF FEEDING.

   I believe every single Christian has his own idiosyncrasy in that
   matter. Beloved, there are some of you who could not constantly hear me
   to profit and yet this is neither my fault nor yours, but a wise
   arrangement, for you can hear some other Brother and thus there is work
   for him as well as for me. If all could be fed by me, and by no one
   else, where would I put my congregation, and where would others get
   theirs? Certain persons can receive the Truth of God from one man
   better than they can from another, not because that man is any better,
   or the other any worse, but because there is a way of putting it, or
   there is a kind of congruity of nature between the hearer and the
   preacher. I am glad to think that God has not cast all His people in
   one mold and made them all desirous to listen to one voice in order to
   be spiritually fed!

   It may happen, moreover, that in our Church there are people who cannot
   be instructed in one of our classes. Well, if it is so, do not quarrel
   with the Brother who conducts it--go to another teacher and try him! Or
   perhaps you are not edified by the teaching of some Christian with whom
   you associate. Well, the world is wide--try another. "Then shall the
   lambs feed in their pasture." Each Christian has his own way of feeding
   on the Word. Let him have it in his own way, and do not judge him!
   There may be something of self in his peculiarity, but perhaps there is
   also something of God's purpose in it. Do not pass an Act of
   Uniformity, but rejoice in the diversities of operations--provided you
   see the same

   Lord!

   There are several things certain about the manner of feeding of all
   lambs. The first is, that if they feed in their pasture, they feed on
   tender grass. Young Christians love the simple Truths of the Gospel
   and, therefore, these ought to be often preached. And we ought not to
   be angry with newborn Believers if they cannot understand the higher
   Doctrines. I hope we shall never, as a Church, exact from young
   converts the wisdom of age. I trust we shall never say, "There, you
   must go back. You won't do for us, you are not up to our mark, for you
   cannot expound the deep things of God." God forbid! If we shut out the
   lambs, where shall we get our sheep? If the Lord has received them, let
   us receive them! No father excludes a child from his table when he is
   three or four years old because he is not yet able to speak Latin. If
   the little ones know their A B C, it is a good beginning. We think a
   great deal of the first little verse our babes repeat--they say it in
   such a strange way that nobody thinks it is language at all except
   father and mother, but they are charmed with the simplest form of
   speech which infant lips can try! So, to see a little spiritual
   knowledge in new converts should gratify us and cause us to love them.
   Leave the lambs to feed on tender grass and you older ones may take as
   much of the tougher herbage as you like.

   Again, lambs like to feed little and often. They are not able to take
   in much at a time, but they like to be often at it. I love to see our
   young people coming to the Prayer Meetings and week-day services so
   continually. You will grow in Grace if you are often engaged in the
   means of Grace--but it is possible to make such things a weariness to
   the flesh if they become protracted. Strong saints can bear whole days
   of devotion and delight in them. Yes, a whole week spent alone in a
   sacred retreat might be a glorious holiday--a holy day--rather, an
   anticipation of Heaven! But for young Believers, let them have here a
   little and there a little--a text and a text, line upon line, precept
   upon precept--but let them have it often. "Then shall the lambs feed in
   their pasture."

   The lambs, if they feed well, feed quietly in their pasture. If there
   is a dog in the field, they will not feed. If they are driven about
   here and there and not allowed to rest, they cannot feed. I pity young
   Christians who get into churches where there are disturbances and
   troubles. Oh, may we always be kept at peace! I bless God for the love
   that has reigned among us. May it continue and may it deepen! Beloved
   Friends, when we fall out with one another, we shall find that the
   Spirit of God has fallen out with us! We cannot expect to see young
   converts among us at all, much less can we hope to see them advance in
   Divine Grace if we indulge a party spirit, or a controversial spirit
   within the fold. All Believers should endeavor to maintain a sacred
   quiet within the Church for the sake of the little ones. Have you never
   heard of the child who was greatly impressed under a sermon and had
   resolved to pray on reaching home, but he heard his father and mother
   on the road home discussing the discourse and finding such fault with
   it, that the happy season of tenderness passed away from that child
   and, in later years, he was accustomed to say that his becoming an
   infidel was due to that conversation? Let the lambs feed in quiet. If a
   little bit of the sermon suits my boy, though it seems childish to me,
   let me be glad that there is something for him! If the preacher stated
   the Truth in a way which I do not like, I daresay the preacher's Master
   knows how to guide him far better than I do! And perhaps my neighbor
   who sat next to me has profited by precisely that which I have
   criticized. Let the lambs feed quietly. I would say to young
   Christians--Never mix up in the controversies of these days. There are
   people about who seem to be cut on the cross and the only use they are
   in this world seems to be to raise irritating questions. They and the
   mosquitoes were created by Infinite Wisdom, but I have never been able
   to discover the particular blessing which either of them confer upon
   us! Those persons who discuss and discuss, and do nothing else, had
   better be left alone. If there is a way to live peaceably with all men,
   I should say to the young Christian, "Follow it." The lambs feed best
   when they are not worried, but dwell in peace with all.

   Then, next, when lambs feed in their pasture, they feed in pleasure. A
   very disorderly lot the lambs are! If you look over the gate at them,
   they are never proper and solemn. An artist could scarcely sketch them
   in their frisking and frolicking about! Young Christians ought not to
   be told to cease their holy mirth--they ought not to be expected as yet
   to groan with those that groan--but let them rejoice with those that
   rejoice! Their days of sorrow will probably come soon enough, without
   their being anticipated. Let them rejoice in the Lord, yes, let them
   rejoice always! I am glad our friends do not universally call out in
   the Tabernacle, "Hallelujah," and "Hosannah," and the like. But, for my
   part, when I am preaching in the open air in the country and our
   Methodist friends do so, it seems to stir my blood and I am glad of it.
   It is much better than having a sleepy congregation!

   A little excitement in the Christian Church, especially by young
   converts, is by no means to be deprecated. I remember hearing dear
   Doctor Fletcher say, when talking to a number of children, that he once
   saw a boy standing on his head, dancing on the pavement and displaying
   all sorts of antics of joy. He stopped near him and said, "Well, my
   Lad, you seem to be exceedingly merry." "I think I am, and so would you
   be, Sir, (or Guv'nor, I think he said,) if you had been locked up three
   months and had just got out." "Well," said the venerable man, "I
   thought it very reasonable, indeed, and I told him by no means to stop
   his performances because of me." Now, when a poor man has felt the
   burden of sin and has been shut up in the prison of the Law of God, and
   Jesus comes and brings him out--and he begins to rejoice with
   unspeakable joy, and full of glory--if any man living would stop him, I
   would not! No, let him rejoice! Let the lambs feed "in their pasture."
   And if somebody tonight should come to me, and say, "Your young
   converts have been extravagant in expression and injudicious in zeal,"
   I would reply, "My dear Brother, are you better than these young ones?
   At any rate, there is one respect in which you are worse, for you show
   a propensity to find fault with those who are serving God with all
   their might. Go your way and join them! If you have not a heart to do
   so, and if they seem to be enthusiastic beyond measure, only thank God
   that there are yet some few left among us who can appreciate
   fervor--and wish that there were a little more of it." For my own part,
   I would like to see a downright fanatic. It is so long since one has
   set one's eyes upon such a curiosity that I should like to see
   one--just one! I have seen snow enough, pray let me see a fire-flake! I
   have seen thousands of wet blankets--oh for the touch of a live coal!
   Enthusiasm in excess might be a blessing in disguise. Let the lambs
   feed pleasantly in their own wild, natural way.

   Once more, when the lambs feed in their pasture, they feed in company.
   They like to get with others if they can. Sheep thrive best in flocks.
   I call upon every young Christian here to get into some part of
   Christ's flock. I invite you into this portion of Christ's Church, but
   if you find another where, all things considered, you think it would be
   better for you to be, go there! Mind that you join yourself first to
   Christ--and after that unite with His people. Do not try to go to
   Heaven as a solitary individual, that is not the Christian way. Jesus
   gathers His people into a Church--He does not profess to lead His
   people one by one, as solitary pilgrims, but they are to go in groups
   and bands. From company to company they proceed towards the New
   Jerusalem. May you have much love to the visible Church and believe
   that, notwithstanding all her faults, there is none like her on the
   earth! That, notwithstanding all her spots, she is excellent for
   beauty, and fairest among women!

   III. I must close with the remark that IN THE WORST OF TIMES, GOD WILL
   SEE THAT HIS LAMBS AND

   THE REST OF HIS FLOCK ARE FED.

   It is said, in the text, "Then shall the lambs feed in their pasture."
   That is, when the vineyard was destroyed and the hedge broken down.
   When thorns and briars had come up and the clouds had refused to rain.
   And God had sent desolation upon Israel and the people were gone into
   captivity--even then shall the lambs feed in their pasture! This is a
   blessed Truth of God--come what may, God's people shall be saved and
   they shall have spiritual food! There may come persecuting times. Never
   mind! Never did Christ seem so glorious as when He walked with His
   Church in the dungeon and up to the stake! Never were there sweeter
   songs than those which rose from the Lollards' tower and Bonner's
   coal-hole. Never did the Church have such marriage feasts as when her
   members died at the gallows and the fire! Christ Jesus has made Himself
   preeminently near and dear to a persecuted Church! Therefore fear not
   if you should have your little trouble to bear in the family, or rebuke
   and shame from an evil world--for you shall feed in your pasture.
   Though your mother should be grieved, though your husband should be
   angry, though your brother should ridicule, though your employer should
   scoff--you shall be fed with spiritual food and your soul shall
   surmount all these evils, triumphant in

   her God!

   "But I dread," says one, "that there will come times of sickness to me.
   I have premonitions of it." Yes, but you shall be fed in your pasture.
   And I, for one, bear witness that sometimes periods of sickness are
   times of the greatest spiritual nourishment! The Lord can furnish a
   table in the wilderness! A very wilderness sickness is of itself, but
   God can find us daily manna. He can make you strongest in heart when
   you are weakest in body. Therefore fear not, God will feed you!

   "I am afraid of poverty," says one. Are you? That has been the lot of
   many of His people. For many an age has the Lord chosen the poor to be
   His disciples. You need not fear that. Your Master was poor--you will
   never be as poor as He was, for He had nowhere to lay His head. Fear
   not, He will feed you. Can you not trust Him? "Ah, but I fear death,"
   says one. "Then shall the lambs feed in their pasture." Even in the
   Valley of the Shadow of Death you shall find tender grass! Have you
   never seen others die? Has it not been a joyous thing to see some
   saints depart? I recall to your memories, dear Brothers and Sisters,
   those who have but lately ascended whom we loved. Was there anything
   terrible about their deaths? Did they not smile upon us in their last
   hours and make us feel that we would willingly change places with them,
   and die as they died? Have I not often seen the young girl sickening
   with consumption and heard from her strange things that made me think
   her half a Prophetess--a Seer whose eyes had been anointed so that she
   had looked within the veil and seen the Glory of the Invisible? Oh, how
   texts of Scripture have been placed in golden settings by dying saints!
   How sweetly have they set promises to music! Speak of monks and their
   illuminated missals! Scripture illuminated by dying saints is far more
   marvelous! What amazing joy they have felt! They told us that joy was
   killing them--that they did not die of the disease, but of excessive
   delight! It was as though the great floods of Glory had burst their
   banks and they were being swept right away by them to eternal bliss! It
   has visibly been blessed for the saints to die and, therefore, it is
   foo-lish--perhaps wicked--for any child of God to be afraid to depart.
   "Then shall the lambs feed in their pasture," feeding near the very
   scythe of death and cropping choice morsels at the grave's mouth--for
   the Lamb, Jesus Christ, being with them--no lamb of all the flock shall
   have cause to fear!

   We shall now separate and scatter, as congregations have scattered, I
   might say, these hundreds of times from this House. And scattering and
   going each, our own way, to his home--shall we ever meet again?
   Probably by no means shall we, all of us, meet in the body, so that
   these eyes shall look to other eyes and say, "I saw those eyes before."
   Well, well, truth be the truth remembered that we are a flock and must
   gather again in one meeting place before the Judgment Seat, on that day
   of wrath, that dreadful day! Shall we meet, then, as the sheep of
   Christ, or, meeting, will it be to be divided, to the right and to the
   left, as the sheep of the Great King, or the goats condemned to be cast
   away? We shall certainly meet there, but will it be an eternal meeting
   of unending joy? God grant it may! Oh, infinite mercy of the blessed
   God, let us all be united at the Throne of Christ!

   But I hear you say, O angel, in answer to that prayer--I hear you speak
   out of the Glory and say, "There can be no union at the Throne of God
   except there first be union at the Cross." Listen to that warning and
   come to Jesus! There stands the Cross, which is the center of the
   Church! Lo, I see upon it the Son of God, His wounds still fountains of
   cleansing blood! Will you come to the Cross? Will you trust the
   Redeemer? Will you bow before Him? Will you be washed in His blood?
   Will you be saved with His salvation? If so, we shall all meet in
   Heaven to see the face of the Lamb in His Glory. God grant we may, for
   Jesus sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM23,24.

   Did you ever notice that the 22nd Psalm exhibits "that Great Shepherd
   of the sheep" as laying down His life for the sheep? And that the 23rd
   Psalm exhibits "the Good Shepherd" with all His sheep around Him happy
   and restful, while the 24th Psalm represents "the Chief Shepherd" who
   shall appear in due time--and when He does appear, then shall His
   sheep, also, appear with Him in Glory?

   Psalm 23:1. The LORD is my Shepherd, I shall not want. [See Sermon
   #3006, Volume 52--"the lord is my shepherd."] How can a sheep want, or
   have needs, when it has a good and

   wise shepherd able and willing to provide for it? And how can a
   Believer want when he has God, Himself, the ever-gracious and
   Omnipotent Lord of All, to provide his needs and to prevent him from
   ever knowing what want means? David does not say, "I shall have all I
   wish for because the Lord is my Shepherd," but he does say, "I shall
   not want. Not only have I no need now, but I never shall need while my
   Shepherd lives. Though I am only one out of His countless flock, yet He
   cares for me and, therefore, 'I shall not want.'" Why should a Believer
   think that he shall ever want? Let him look at his present condition.

   2, 3. He makes me to lie down in green pastures: He leads me beside the
   still waters. He restores my soul: He leads me in the path of
   righteousness for His name's sake. Here are four blessed things that
   the Lord does for the Believer. "He makes me to lie down." He gives me
   rest, perfect rest and He gives me so much spiritual provision that I
   am unable to take it all in--so I lie down and rest in it as a sheep
   does in the deep pastures where it seems lost in the provender! There
   are such deep Doctrines, such glorious privileges, such wondrous
   Revelations of the heart of God in this blessed Book, that you and I
   cannot comprehend it all, but we can lie down in it--"He makes me to
   lie down in green pastures." Take a good stretch, Brothers and Sisters
   in Christ! Some are afraid to lie down in the green pastures of the
   Word of God. I know some of God's saints who seem to be afraid of being
   too happy--they do not like to be too restful. Let no such fear ever
   cross your mind. "He makes me"--and He would not make us do what was
   not good for us--"He makes me to lie down in green pastures."

   Then come those three sweet words, "He leads me," which in themselves
   are full of music--

   "He leads me. He leads me! By His own hand He leads me!" You know how
   our song makes these words ring out over and over again and it is truly
   charming. "He leads me." The Holy Spirit is our Guide and as the
   softly-flowing river of Grace marks our journey, we sing, "He leads me
   beside the still waters." You and I sometimes go wandering by the noisy
   brooks that ripple over the stones and make such a noise because they
   are so shallow. But when the Spirit guides us, it is beside the deep
   rivers, the deep still waters that He leads us.

   "He restores my soul." Is not that a blessed little sentence? When my
   soul gets empty, He stores it again--re-stores it. When it goes
   wandering away from Him--

   "He brings my wandering spirit back When I forsake His ways."

   And when I get spiritually sick, He gives me a sweet restorative and
   renews my health--"He restores my soul." Blessed be the name of the
   great Restorer!

   "He leads me"--here comes those sweet words again--"He leads me in the
   paths of righteousness." They are very pleasant paths, for nothing is
   more pleasant to a Believer than to be walking in "the paths of
   righteousness." God has so constituted His people that if they get out
   of the right way, they get out of the way of peace. He has so re-made
   us that our peace and our righteousness agree together--and as long as
   we are led in the paths of righteousness, we are a happy and a restful
   people! The Lord does all this for us, "for His Name's sake."

   4. Yes, though I walk Yes, though I walk, not only though I shall walk,
   but though I do walk now--

   4. Through the valley of the shadow of death. Though long before I die,
   I seem to learn what death means in the cold chill that takes hold upon
   my spirit and freezes all my joy--

   4. I will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff
   they comfort me. Some seem to think that God's people would have no
   distress of mind and no trouble if they were trusting in God. But it is
   not so. Even they "walk through the valley of the shadow of death," but
   they "fear no evil" even there! When all is dark around you, remember

   that verse, "Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the voice
   of His servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? Let Him trust
   in the name of the Lord and rely upon His God." There would be no room
   for faith if it were always summertime and always noontide. But
   Christians are sometimes called to pass through that gloomy experience
   which Mr. Bunyan has so beautifully pictured under the symbol here
   used, "the valley of the shadow of death." It is a terrible journey,
   yet there is no cause for fear to strike the Christian's heart even
   there for, let the worst come to the worst, he can say to his Lord,
   with David, "You are with me; Your rod and Your staff they comfort me"

   Now look back to the 14th and 15th verses of the 22nd Psalm, and you
   will see how fully Christ can sympathize with His people--because He,
   also, walked through the valley of the shadow of death even as they
   have to do! Hear Him crying there, "I am poured out like water and all
   My bones are out ofjoint: My heart is like wax, it is melted in the
   midst of My body. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and My
   tongue sticks to My jaws and You have brought Me"--remember that this
   is the Savior speaking here--"You have brought Me into the dust of
   death." Well then, there is great comfort for the sheep in the fact
   that their Shepherd has been along that gloomy way before them!

   5. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. See
   what cool, calm courage David here displays. Usually, when a warrior is
   in the presence of his enemies, he just eats a bit of bread, or
   something that he can swallow while getting ready for the fight that is
   impending. But David took matters much more quietly than that. Though
   his enemies were all around him, there was a table prepared for
   him--that is to say, there was everything ready for a feast just as if
   it had been a holiday instead of the day of battle! "You prepare a
   table before me in the presence of my enemies." You may grin or howl,
   you devils! You may do what you like, but the true Believer takes no
   notice of you! His table is being prepared by his God while you, armed
   to the teeth, are seeking to slay him! What a contrast there is between
   the rage of the Believer's enemies and the quiet, calm confidence of
   the man himself!

   5. You anoint my head with oil A sweet savor shall be upon the man who
   is thus anointed by his God.

   5. My cup runs over. [See Sermons #874, Volume 15--THE OVERFLOWING CUP
   and #1222, Volume 21--THE OVERFLOWING CUP.] "I have more than I
   expected--more than I ever asked for--more than I desired--more than I
   am capable of holding!" "My cup runs over." If ever your cup does thus
   run over, be sure to call your poor neighbors in to catch the
   overflowing mercy! If ever you have more blessing than you can hold,
   ask some other Christian to share it with you. Recollect what Peter and
   his companions did when, at Christ's command, they let down the net and
   caught more fish than their net could hold without breaking--they
   beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they
   should come and help them. "What? Come and help them fish?" Oh,
   no--come and help them share the fish! Many persons say, "You are
   kindly invited to come to such-and-such a meeting," because they want
   to get something out of you--but it is a better kind of invitation when
   you are asked because there is something to be given away--and those
   who have an overflowing cup want you to share the blessing with them.

   6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.I
   shall never be able to outrun the goodness and mercy of my God! I shall
   always have closely attendant upon me His goodness to supply my needs
   and His mercy to forgive my sins.

   6. And I will dwell in the house of the LORD forevei.

   Psalm 24:1. The earth is the LORD'S, and the fullness thereof And
   therefore it is also the Believer's! The real fullness of the earth
   belongs to the Christian. "The meek shall inherit the earth."

   1, 2. The world, and they that dwell therein. For He has foundedit upon
   the seas, and established it upon the floods. So, child of God, you are
   in your Father's house even while you are down here on earth! Still,
   that question in the next verse is very suggestive. Albeit that the
   earth is the Lord's, yet we do not want to stay in it forever.

   3. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? [See Sermon #396, Volume
   7--CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN.] Or who shall stand in His holy place? This
   is the portion of the Lord's people--to ascend the hill of the Zion
   that is above, to enter the New Jerusalem and to stand in the immediate
   Presence of God. But who shall ever be able to do that?

   4, 5. He that has clean hands, andapure heart; who has not lifted up
   his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully; he shall receive the
   blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his
   salvation. The man who will go to Heaven is the clean man, the man who
   has been washed from his sins in the blood of the Lamb. And he is clean
   just where he was most likely to be foul--he has "clean hands." Grace
   has enabled him to touch the things of the world without receiving a

   stain from them, and to touch holy things without defiling them. This
   expression--"clean hands"--refers to his outward life, but he is also
   clean inside, for he has "a pure heart." If a man were clean as to his
   actions, but not clean as to his motives, he would not be fit to enter
   Heaven. But the man described here is a true man. He has not followed
   after vanity, neither has he uttered a lie, but he has followed the
   Truth of God and he has spoken the Truth. He is the man whom God will
   bless, but he has no righteousness of his own, so we read that, "he
   shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the
   God of his salvation." So he needs to be saved and he needs a
   righteousness better than his own, and this God will give him!

   6. This is the generation Jacob, of them that seek Him, who seek Your
   face. Selah. It is a wonderful thing that Jesus Christ should take His
   people's name but He does. He gives His Church His own name in that
   remarkable passage in Jeremiah 33:16--"This is the name wherewith she
   shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness." And now, to make the
   union complete, He takes her name as His own--Christ is here called
   "Jacob."

   7-10. Lift up your heads, O you gates; and be you lift up, you
   everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall come in. Who is this
   King of Glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.
   Lift up your heads, O you gates, even lift them up, you everlasting
   doors; and the King of Glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory?
   The LORD of Hosts, He is the King of Glory. Selah. Now, if Christ is
   our Shepherd in the meadows down here where He makes us to lie down in
   the green pastures of His Grace, He will also be our Shepherd in the
   heavenly pastures up there on the hilltops of Glory where the Lamb
   which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed us and shall lead us
   unto living fountains of waters! And we shall delight forever to
   "follow the Lamb wherever He goes."

Faith Justifying Speech

   (No. 3200)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 2, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 9, 1873.

   "Ibelieved, therefore have I spoken." Psalm 116:10.

   SOME translators render this passage, "I believed, though I have spoken
   as I have done," for the Psalmist had spoken words suggestive of
   unbelief. But, although he had spoken unwisely and unbelievingly, yet,
   deep down in his heart, he did still believe in his God. What a mercy
   it is for us that God does not judge us by our hasty speeches! If He
   can see only a spark of faith amidst the dense smoke of our unbelief,
   He accepts it!

   We will, however, take the text as we find it in our version--"I
   believed, therefore have I spoken." To speak what we believe to be
   false is atrocious. God grant that our lips may never be defiled by the
   utterance of anything that we do not really believe! To speak what we
   only think to be true is idle and often mischievous. Many have been
   grieved and hurt by the repetition of slanders which have passed from
   mouth to mouth without anyone being able to vouch for their
   accuracy--and those who repeated them have often done serious injury to
   the characters of those who were far better than themselves. On the
   other hand, to know the Truth of God, and not to speak it, is cowardly.
   The Psalmist did not say, "I believed, and yet I was silent," for that
   silence might have proved that he was of a cowardly spirit and was
   afraid that some unpleasant consequences might come upon himself if he
   dared to deliver unpopular truth. Every speaker is glad enough to say
   that which will please his auditors and bring credit to himself, but a
   true man declares what he believes, even though his hearers gnash their
   teeth at him because of his faithful testimony! To speak what you
   believe is your du-ty--to speak what you believe will be likely to
   benefit those who hear it and to speak what you believe will bring
   honor and glory to God who taught you the Truth. Therefore say with the
   Psalmist , "'I believed, therefore have I spoken.' I spoke out with my
   tongue what I had verified in my inmost soul."

   I am going to use the text in three ways. First, as the justification
   of the Christian minister Secondly, as the argument for Christian
   profession. And thirdly, as the motive for supplication.

   I. First, then, let us consider our text as THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE
   CHRISTIAN MINISTER. "I believed, therefore have I spoken."

   No man ever ought to speak in God's name, as a preacher of the Gospel,
   unless he can say, "I believed, therefore have I spoken." When Paul
   quoted this verse, he added, "We also believe, and, therefore, speak."
   And we who preach the Gospel, if we are really sent of God, believe
   what we speak in His name. It is a scandal and a shame that there are
   some ministers who do not believe the doctrines of the church to which
   they belong, yet they still retain both their position and their pay. I
   would not consider that I was worthy of the name of an honest man if I
   took money as the pastor of a Christian Church after I had given up my
   belief in the Truths I had professed to hold. We hear a great deal,
   nowadays, about the liberty of ministers to preach what they like, but
   what about the liberty of the people? Are they not to be considered?
   Are churches made for ministers, or ministers made for churches? After
   the people have elected a man to be their pastor, and he changes his
   views, it is only common honesty that he should say so and no longer
   pretend to preach what he does not believe, or to belong to a church
   with which he is not sincerely in sympathy. I cannot imagine a more
   dreary task than it would be for me to stand here simply to repeat what
   you wished me to say although my heart did not endorse the words I had
   to utter! I would never be such a slave as that, but would sooner break
   stones on the road, or labor at the treadmill in prison!

   There are some who do not believe the Bible, but we believe it. There
   are some who question the great Truths of the faith, but we can lay our
   hand upon our heart and say that we do not question them. There are
   some who deny the Deity of Christ and the efficacy of His atoning blood
   but, as for us, we verily believe them and, therefore, we proclaim them
   to others. We believe what we speak--and we speak because we believe
   God has called us to speak. If we could be silent, we would, but we
   feel that we must preach the Gospel! The man who is sent of God cannot
   do otherwise than deliver the message that has been given to him--he
   feels that the fire within him would consume him if he did not let
   flaming words pour forth from his lips! It was because the Lord had
   made Ezekiel a watchman unto the house of Israel that he proclaimed his
   Master's message with such power and unction--and it must be in a
   similar way that a minister must be to his people as the mouth of God!

   Moreover, we believe that the Truths of God we are bid to preach are so
   important that we cannot be silent concerning them. We believe that all
   have sinned and come short of the glory of God, that God is angry with
   the wicked every day and that, if men live and die in their sins, they
   must be cast away from His Presence forever. There may be some of our
   hearers who will not give heed to our message, but we believe it and,
   therefore, we speak it. It has become unfashionable to talk of Hell and
   to mention the wrath to come which is awaiting the ungodly, but
   fashionable or unfashionable, we cannot keep silent concerning these
   terrible Truths and we try to use them as Paul did, "Knowing therefore,
   the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." We will not, in unhallowed
   silence, keep back from sinners a true statement of their present lost
   condition and of their future awful doom unless they repent of their
   sin and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ! I have often used as the
   language of my own heart those solemn lines that John Wesley
   translated--

   "Shall I for fear of feeble man, Your Spirit's course in me restrain?
   Or undismayed in deed and word, Be a true witness for my Lord? Awed by
   a mortal's frown, Shall I conceal the Word of God Most High? How then
   before You shall I dare To stand, or how Your anger bear? Shall I, to
   soothe the unholy throng, Soften Your Truths and smooth my tongue? To
   gain earth's gilded toys, or flee The Cross endured, my God, by Thee?
   The love of Christ does me constrain To seek the wandering souls of men
   With cries, entreaties, tears, to save, To snatch them from the fiery
   wave." There, is, however, more than this that we believe and,
   therefore, speak. We believe that a great Atonement has been offered
   for sin, that by His death upon Calvary's Cross, Jesus Christ cleared
   the channel of Divine Mercy so that now, without injury to His Justice,
   God can forgive human transgression. Most intensely do we believe,
   "that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not
   imputing their trespasses unto them; and has committed unto us the word
   of reconciliation." How can we keep silent when we have such good
   tidings to tell? Accursed would be our lips if we should retain this
   heavenly secret! We will not do so. We believe and, therefore, do we
   proclaim to all that "God so loved the world, that He gave His
   only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but
   have everlasting life."

   We believe that there is a full and free pardon for every sinner who
   believes in Jesus, that there is acceptance with God through the
   righteousness of Christ for every sinner who truly repents and
   believes, that there is regeneration, that there is adoption into the
   family of God, that there is salvation here, and eternal glory
   hereafter, for everyone that believes in Jesus! And believing all this,
   can we remain silent concerning it? Why, sometimes when a man has made
   a great discovery, he feels as if he must run down the street, as that
   old mathematician did, crying, "Eureka! Eureka!" when he had solved the
   problem that had so long puzzled him. We, too, can cry, "Eureka!
   Eureka!" for we have found what we long sought in vain! We have found a
   sovereign balm for every wound, a cordial for all care. We have found
   that which brings even the dead to life and which will bring to Heaven
   those who have been lying at Hell's dark door! How can we

   keep to ourselves such wondrous discoveries as these? Can we hide in
   our own heart all that we have learned concerning our blessed Savior?
   As for me, I say with Charles Wesley--

   "My gracious Master and my God,

   Assist me to proclaim

   And spread through all the earth abroad,

   The honors of Your name."

   Further, we speak the Truth of God that has been revealed to us because
   we believe the preaching of the Gospel will effect great good. We do
   not preach the Gospel merely because we believe that it may be
   useful--we preach it because we believe that it must be useful. It is
   not with us a question whether God will or will not bless the ministry
   that He has Himself ordained--we believe that He must bless His own
   Word, for we have His promise that He will do so. "It shall not return
   unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall
   prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." There is not a true sermon
   preached beneath the cope of Heaven, whether in a cathedral, or on a
   village green, that God will not bless, in some way or other, and make
   it tend to His own Glory. We do not expect this result because of any
   merit or fitness in our hearers, for they are spiritually like the dry
   bones that Ezekiel saw in the valley. Our faith is in the Spirit of God
   to whom we cry even as the Prophet cried, "Come from the four winds, O
   Breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live." And the
   result in our case is the same as it was in his--

   "Dry bones are raised, and clothed afresh, And hearts of stone are
   turned to flesh."

   We believe and, therefore, do we speak--and this often accounts for our
   style of speaking--and sometimes accounts for the faults of it. The man
   who believes does not always weigh his words, or guard his statements,
   or speak as coolly and deliberately as others do. They tell us that we
   sometimes wax too warm. If we do, it is because we believe so fervently
   the Truths of God that we preach! Some say that, at times, we are harsh
   and intolerant. But he who believes the Truth cannot be tolerant of the
   error that would cloud it! Was Elijah too harsh? That is not a question
   that we need answer-- we know that it was because he believed so fully
   in Jehovah that he could not have any part or lot with the prophets of
   Baal or the prophets of the groves. He would not have used the popular
   language of the present day and boasted of his charity to all men, true
   or false. He knew that as truth is true, a lie is a lie, and is to be
   treated as a lie, not as though it ought to be welcomed on equal terms
   with the truth! He believed, and, therefore, he spoke and acted as he
   did! And, dear Friends, you must not be surprised if we sometimes speak
   more severely than you think we ought. Intense conviction often carries
   a man beyond what his hearers might think to be justifiable. I have
   seen politicians excited and some of their words have been anything but
   decorous. I have been in the Paris Bourse and have seen how excited the
   dealers in stocks and shares have been, and how they raged and raved
   like Bedlamites as prices rose and fell. May other men be excited about
   gold or government and may we never be excited about God and His Truth,
   about Heaven and Hell, about the eternal welfare of our own and our
   fellow creatures' souls? This is our justification--we believe and,
   therefore, speak-- we believe so intensely that we are bound to speak
   with the accent of conviction!

   Luther used to preach like one who had found the grand secret which he
   must proclaim to others. Some of the things that he said could not be
   repeated nowadays--they would not at all suit the modern taste--yet he
   spoke as the times in which he lived needed that he should speak! It
   must have been grand to hear him, or that other mighty preacher, John
   Knox, of whom it was said that he was so feeble and so full of pain
   that as he went up to the pulpit, one might have feared that he would
   have died before he finished his discourse, yet, before he had
   proceeded far, so excited did he grow as the Truth of God burned and
   blazed up in his soul, that it seemed as if the pulpit, itself, would
   be smashed to pieces with the intense force that he threw into his
   preaching! Yes, Luther and Knox believed and, therefore, spoke with an
   emphasis and a fervor that would be accounted madness in these prim and
   proper times in which we live! And we would far rather be judged to be
   as "mad" as they were, than seek to please those to whom truth and lies
   appear to be of equal value! No, Sirs, you may mark out certain
   boundaries beyond which you say that we must not go, but we shall leap
   over them if we can thereby save some! And it is quite possible that
   our mannerisms and eccentricities, as you call them, will cause a shock
   to some of your notions of ministerial propriety. If souls are to be
   saved from going down to the Pit, we must be terribly in earnest even
   as our Master was. If brands are to be plucked from the burning, we
   shall not do such work with kid-gloved hands! This generation is so
   engrossed with its idols and heresies that it will not be called to the
   living God by

   gentle whispering or the lisping of a love-sick maid. We must cry aloud
   and spare not! We must preach earnestly, intensely and, as some will
   judge, roughly. And even then, nothing will come of our preaching
   unless the Spirit of God, Himself, shall accompany it with His own
   effectual working in the hearts of our hearers. God grant that He may
   do so!

   I must close this part of the subject by saying that when the Psalmist
   said, "I believed, therefore have I spoken," he meant, "What I spoke,
   that I believed. "And we are prepared to adopt his language and to
   attach the same meaning to it and also to add that what we have spoken
   in the past, that we still believe. We have not changed our views, our
   sentiments, or Doctrines. But do we not pay any tribute to the
   enlightenment of the age? Are we not to keep pace with the growth of
   the intelligence of this wonderful 19th Century? Brothers and Sisters,
   we do not believe in doing anything of the kind! What was true 20 years
   ago is true, now, and what is true now will be just as true 20 years
   hence. I once talked with a minister who said to me, "You must find it
   very easy to preach." I asked him why he thought so, and he replied,
   "Because you believe a certain set of Truths and you have only to
   preach them." "Yes," I answered, "it is so, but is not that also the
   case with you?" "Oh, dear no," he said, "I think my creed out every
   week. It is constantly changing, for I am so receptive." We are also
   receptive--not receptive of modern novelties and heresies, nor of the
   mere fantasies of our own brain, but we are receptive of all that we
   find in this blessed Book! And that never changes. We may receive new
   light upon what is in the Word, but the new light will not make that
   false which was true before the new light came! We hope, when the time
   comes for us to die, that we shall be able to say, "As we commenced our
   ministry, so we finish it. Our first sermon was on the same lines as
   our last. Of course there was a growth in our power of receiving and
   expounding the Truth of God, but it was the same Truth that we received
   and that we preached at the first and at the last." The end of our
   conversion, like that of the Apostle Paul and the faithful preachers of
   his day, has been, is now and, we trust, by God's Grace, still will be,
   "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever."

   II. Now, secondly, we are to use our text as THE ARGUMENT FOR CHRISTIAN
   PROFESSION--"I believed, therefore have I spoken."

   Brothers and Sisters, true faith in the Gospel is not dumb faith. When
   a man believes it, he is bound to make an open profession of his
   belief. What is the Gospel? I will give it to you in our Lord's own
   Words--"He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." There is to
   be the confession of faith made in Baptism as well as the belief of the
   Gospel with the heart. Paul thus summarizes "the word of faith" which
   he preached--"If you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and
   shall believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you
   shall be saved. For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and
   with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." You see how closely
   the confession of faith is connected with the faith, itself. And the
   promise of salvation is given at least in these two texts, to the faith
   that is united with the confession of it. It is the bounden duty of
   everyone who believes in Jesus to confess that he does so believe. You
   know how Christ Himself put it--"Whoever, therefore, shall confess Me
   before men, him will I confess, also, before My Father who is in
   Heaven. But whoever shall deny Me before men, (and denying is, in that
   verse, tantamount to not confessing), him will I also deny before My
   Father who is in Heaven." You have no right to say, "I am a Believer in
   Christ, but I do not make a profession of my faith." The profession of
   your faith is, under the Gospel, just as much your duty as the faith,
   itself, is! Indeed, I venture to say that true faith necessitates a
   confession of some sort. If a man believes the great Truths of which I
   have been speaking, he cannot altogether conceal his belief in
   them--his conviction of their truth is bound to come out sooner or
   later--and the sooner it comes out, the better. John Bunyan tells us
   that when he had found the Savior, he wanted to tell the crows on the
   plowed land all about it--which is to me an indication of the instinct
   which moves a man, when he has found Christ, to want to proclaim the
   good news far and wide!

   Besides, this confession of faith is due to the minister whose message
   has been blessed to his hearers. Should he not be cheered and comforted
   by hearing that the Word he has preached has been used of God to the
   salvation of souls? He has more than enough to depress his
   spirit--ought he not to have anything that he can to encourage him? And
   what can bring him greater joy than the knowledge that he has not
   labored in vain, nor spent his strength for nothing?

   The confession of faith is also due to the Church with which the
   convert unites. In the Apostolic days they first gave themselves unto
   the Lord and then gave themselves unto His people according to the will
   of God. Why should it not be the same now? How else is the Church to
   grow? How is it to have new blood put into its veins except concerning
   the coming forward of the young converts whom the Lord has looked upon
   in His mercy and saved by His Grace?

   The confession of faith is especially due to the Lord who has implanted
   it in the heart. In these evil days when the enemies of the faith seem
   to be ashamed of nothing, none of those who are His friends ought to be
   ashamed of Him. The gage of battle has been thrown down. Many are
   massing around the black standard of the Prince of Darkness, so will
   not all of you who truly love the Prince Emmanuel, rally around His
   blood-red banner?--

   "You that are men, now serve Him,

   Against unnumbered foes!

   Your courage rise with danger,

   And strength to strength oppose." If, indeed, you have been redeemed by
   His precious blood. If His Spirit has, indeed, regenerated you. And if
   His Grace is working in your hearts and lives, surely you cannot be so
   cowardly as to try to conceal yourselves as secret disciples of Christ!
   To do battle for Jesus is the most honorable service on earth! And, in
   the great Day of Account, happy shall he be who has bravely borne his
   part in the great conflict that is now raging between Christ and His
   Truth and anti-Christ and his lies! Come to the front, Brothers and
   Sisters! Come to the front! Press forward to that point where the fight
   is the fiercest, for he is the happiest Christian who can do, and
   dare,and sufferthe most for Jesus Christ, his Lord! Do not, for very
   shame, conceal your faith if you really believe in Jesus!

   Probably the most of you are placed in positions where you are obliged
   to speak if you are Believers. In the workshop, how much is there of
   infidelity! In common business life, how much of indifference! In the
   gayer circles of society, how much of contempt for true religion! And
   in the coarser circles, how much of vulgar blasphemy! Shame on the man
   or woman who can live in the midst of worldlings and never let them
   know that they belong to Christ!

   Surely, too, the very fact that you are so often in the company of
   Christian people ought to make you confess your faith. Even under the
   old dispensation, "they that feared the Lord spoke often, one to
   another." And they that truly fear the Lord do the same now. If you are
   among the God-fearing people of the present day, your speech will
   betray you. Your Brothers and Sisters in Christ will note your accent,
   they will perceive that you use their shibboleth, that you have been
   with Jesus and have learnt of Him. If any of you have received the
   blessing of salvation through the ministry here, come forward and avow
   your faith! I do not urge you to do this simply that we may add to our
   numbers, but as I have already reminded you, this is the reward of our
   labor which we deserve at your hands. If you have, indeed, passed from
   death unto life, come out boldly and say so! Though you may be one of
   the poorer members of the congregation. Though your faith may not be as
   strong as that of others. Yet if it is genuine faith in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, we shall rejoice over you and with you with exceeding joy!
   Whoever you may be, if you are truly trusting in Jesus, "come with us,
   and we will do you good." When the question rings out in your hearing,
   "Who is on the Lord's side?" Answer, "I am! I have enlisted among the
   soldiers of Christ and as I take Him to be my Captain, now, I trust
   that He will acknowledge me as one of His in the day when the last
   muster-roll of His troops is called and He gathers them all around Him
   to share with Him the spoils of His great victory."--

   "Stand up! Stand up for Jesus! The strife will not be long. This day
   the noise of battle, The next the victor's song! To him that overcomes,
   A crown of life shall be-- He with the King of Glory Shall reign
   eternally!"

   III. I can only very briefly refer to the consideration of our text as
   THE MOTIVE FOR SUPPLICATION. "I believed, therefore have I spoken."

   First, I believed in prayer, therefore have I spoken unto God. I did
   not regard it as a religious luxury, a pious but useless exercise and
   waste of time, as so many nowadays say that prayer to God is. I believe
   that as truly as you are listening to me, now, so God listens to me and
   I can speak to Him and receive answers from Him. That is the way to
   pray, young man--to speak to God because you believe that He is the
   hearer and answerer of prayer, for he that comes to God must believe
   that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

   I also believed that Jesus Christ was pleading for me. By faith I could
   see the Man, Christ Jesus, standing before His Father's Throne, with
   His pierced hands uplifted and presenting my poor prayers to His Father
   and so making them acceptable through His intercession on my behalf. I
   believed in Him as the Mediator between God and man and, therefore, I
   dared to speak to God by virtue of His mediation, though I could not
   have acceptably approached the Majesty on High in any other way.

   I also believed in the Holy Spirit as working in me and teaching me how
   to pray. The Holy Spirit gave me right desires and helped my
   infirmities, for I knew not what to pray for as I ought. But because
   the mind of the Spirit is also the mind of God, I was able, under His
   gracious guidance, to approach the Throne of Grace acceptably and,
   therefore, because I believed in the Spirit, therefore have I spoken
   unto God in prayer--and I have not spoken in vain!

   I also believed in God's promise to hear and answer prayer and,
   therefore, I have spoken unto Him in the full conviction that He would
   hear and answer me. I believed that every promise that He had given
   would be kept to the very letter, so I took each promise as I needed
   it, quoted it when bowing before God in prayer--and then left it with
   Him, saying, "Lord, do as You have said. Here is Your promise. I
   believe it, therefore have I spoken it in Your ears. Will You not
   fulfill this Word unto Your servant, whereon You have caused me to
   hope?" I believed that God was faithful, so that He would fulfill His
   promise and that He was willing, so He could fulfill it and grant me
   all that I needed so long as I could find in His Word a promise adapted
   to my case.

   "I believed, therefore have I spoken." This is the way to pray. An
   unbelieving prayer asks God for a refusal of its requests. Remember
   what the Apostle James writes--"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask
   of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraids not; and it shall
   be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
   wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For
   let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the

   Lord."

   If you believe the Bible, speak of it wherever you can. If you believe
   in Jesus, preach Him to all who are within sound of your voice. If you
   believe in the Spirit, walk in His might and tell others of that
   wondrous power. But if you have never believed, may the Lord grant you
   Grace to believe in Father, Son and Holy Spirit! May He grant you Grace
   to believe the Bible, Grace to believe the Gospel and then, when you
   have believed, may you not keep the blessing to yourself, but first
   make your own personal confession of faith--and then publish far and
   wide all that has been revealed to you by the Spirit! So shall you be
   able to say with the Psalmist, "I believed, therefore have I spoken."
   God grant it, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM116

   We have read this Psalm many times. Let us read it now, regarding it
   not so much as the language of the Psalmist uttered thousands of years
   ago, but as our own language at this moment.

   Verse 1.1 love the LORD. Let us go as far as that if we can. Let us,
   each one, say, "I love the Lord."

   1. Because.There is a reason for this love. People say that love is
   blind, but love to God uses her eyes and can justify herself! "I love
   the Lord, because"--

   1. He has heard my voice and my supplications. [See Sermon #240, Volume
   5--PRAYER ANSWERED, LOVE NOURISHED.] Can you go as far as that? Do you
   recollect answers to prayer when you cried to God with your voice, or
   when your voice failed you, but supplication rose to God from your
   heart? Surely there is not a man whose prayers have been answered, who
   does not love God! He must love the Lord when he recollects what poor
   prayers his were, what great blessings came in answer to them and how
   speedily and how often God has heard his prayers and granted his
   requests!

   2. Because He has inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
   Him as long as I live. That is a vow which we may well make and hope
   for Grace to keep it. It means that as we have succeeded so well in
   begging at God's door, we will keep on begging of Him as long as we
   live. I suppose the Psalmist meant that because Jehovah had heard him,
   therefore he would never call upon any false god but, as long as he
   lived, he would resort to the one living and true God. I hope that you
   and I can say the same. We have tried the Fountain of Living
   Waters--why should we go to broken cis-

   terns that can hold no water? Prayer to God has always succeeded--why
   should we not continue it? All you who have plied the trade of
   mendicants at the Mercy Seat must have been so enriched by it in your
   souls that you are determined to stand there as long as you live.
   "Because He has inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
   Him as long as I live." This is sound reasoning, for even the emotions
   of Believers, when they are most fervent, are based upon solid reasons.
   We can defend ourselves even when we grow warmest in love to God and
   most earnest in prayer! Now the Psalmist tells one of his many
   experiences in prayer--

   3. 4. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of Hell got hold
   upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then I called upon the name of the
   LORD.Dark days are good days for praying. When your eyes cannot see,
   you pray all the better! When there is no earthly prop to lean upon,
   you are all the more ready to lean upon God alone! The Psalmist was
   like a poor worm in a ring of fire--"the sorrows of death compassed
   me." The sheriffs officer seemed to hold him in his grip--"the pains of
   Hell got hold upon me." As for his inner experience, he found nothing
   there but "trouble and sorrow." When the town of Mansoul was besieged,
   every way of escape was closed except the way upwards--and it was so
   with the Psalmist and, therefore, he made use of that way! "Then I
   called upon the name of the Lord." His prayer was short, earnest and
   full of meaning--

   4. O LORD. I beseech You, deliver my soul. [See Sermon #1216, Volume
   21--TO SOULS IN AGONY.] He did not have to search for a form of
   prayer--his words were such as came naturally to his mind--and that is
   the best sort of prayer which arises out of the heart's sincere desire.

   5. Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful The
   Psalmist was delivered by an act of Grace, yet it was an act of
   righteousness, for God is not unrighteous to break His own promise, and
   He has promised to help His people. Grace and righteousness both
   guarantee answers to believing prayers--and mercy comes in to make
   assurance doubly sure--"Yes, our God is merciful."

   6. The LORD preserves the simple.Straightforward men, those who cannot
   play a double part, those simpletons whom others take in and laugh at
   because they are honest, true, genuine--the Lord preserves such people!

   6. I was brought low and He helped me. Oh, these blessed personal
   pronouns! Are you laying hold of them as I read them? Are you speaking
   them out of your own soul?

   7. Return unto your rest, O my soul; for the LORD has dealt bountifully
   with you [See Sermon #2758, Volume 47--"return

   UNTO YOUR REST."] Come home to Him, for you have no other

   friend like He in earth or Heaven! Come back to Him, my Soul, and rest
   where you have often rested before.

   8. For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and
   my feet from falling. An eternity of mercies from the Eternal, Himself!

   9. I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. The best
   style of living is walking before God, so living in His sight as to be
   indifferent to the opinions and judgments of our fellow men and only
   caring to know that God is looking upon us with approval. This is the
   way to live! And if we have tried it, we have found it to be so
   pleasant that we are resolved to continue in it!

   10. 11. I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: I
   said in my haste, All men are liars. They have all failed me. Some of
   them could but would not help me, so they were as liars to me. Others
   would but could not, and as I have trusted them, they were as liars to
   me! But You, my God, are no liar, You are the Truth itself! I ask those
   of you who have had a very long and varied experience to look back and
   tell me whether you can recollect even once when your God has broken
   His promise. You have sometimes been afraid that He would forget it,
   but has He ever done so? If you speak as you have found Him, you must
   praise and adore the Faithful, Immutable, All-Sufficient Jehovah who
   has made your strength to be as your days even to this very hour!

   12. What shall I render unto the LORD for all His benefits toward
   me?That question contains the essence of true religion. This should be
   the one objective of our lives if we have been redeemed by Christ and
   are His servants. Whatever we have done for God, we should endeavor to
   do much more--and to do it much better.

   13. I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the
   LORD. This is a curious way of rendering anything, yet you know that
   John Newton's hymn says--

   "The best return for one like me So wretched and so poor,

   Sermon #3200

   14-16. I will say my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all His
   people. Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints. O
   LORD, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant and the son of Your
   handmaid: You have

   a great blessing if we are able to say, as David did, that we are born
   into God's house. Some of us had gracious mothers who brought us to the
   Lord in earnest prayer long before we knew anything. I can say to the
   Lord, "I am Your servant and the son of Your handmaid"--and I have no
   greater wish than that all my descendants may be the Lord's.

   17-18. I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call
   upon the name of the LORD, I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the
   presence of all His people. Do it, Beloved! Let your hearts pour
   themselves out in silence, now, and afterwards in grateful song before
   the Lord. Praise Him, magnify Him, bless His name, "in the presence of
   all His people." It is inspiriting to be with your Brothers and Sisters
   in Christ. Perhaps the devotion which burns low when there is only one
   brand on the hearth will burn all the better and brighter when we add
   many blazing brands to it!

   19. In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of you, O
   Jerusalem. Praise you the LORD.

Mercy for the Meanest of the Flock

   (No. 3201)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 9, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "In that day, says the Lord, will I assemble the lame, and I will
   gather the outcast, and those whom I have afflicted." Micah 4:6.

   THIS is spoken, I suppose, in the first place, of the Jewish people who
   have been so afflicted on account of their sin that they almost cease
   to be a nation. They are driven here and there among the lands and made
   to suffer greatly. In the last time, when Christ shall appear in His
   Glory in the days of halcyon peace, then shall Israel partake of the
   universal joy. Poor, limping, faltering Israel, afflicted with tempest,
   shall yet be gathered and rejoice in her God!

   However, I am sure that the text applies to the Church of God and we
   shall not do amiss if we also find in it promises to individual
   Christians. We will regard the text in those two lights as spoken to
   the Church and as spoken to individual souls.

   I. First, then, AS REFERRING TO THE CHURCH OF GOD. "In that day, says
   the Lord, will I assemble the lame, and I will gather the outcast, and
   those whom I have afflicted."

   The Church of God is not always equally vigorous and prosperous.
   Sometimes she can run without weariness and walk without fainting, but
   at other times she begins to limp and is lame. There is a deficiency in
   her faith, a lukewarm-ness in her love, doctrinal errors spring up and
   many things that both weaken and trouble her--and then she becomes like
   a lame person. And, indeed, Beloved, when I compare the Church of God
   at the present moment with the first Apostolic Church, she may well be
   called, "the lame." Oh, how she leaped in the first Pentecostal times!
   What wondrous strength she had throughout all Judea and all the
   neighboring lands! The voice of the Church in those days was like the
   voice of a lion--and the nations heard and trembled. The utmost isles
   of the sea understood the power of the Gospel and before long the Cross
   of Christ was set up on every shore. Thus was the Church in her early
   days--the love of her espousals was upon her and her strength was like
   that of a young unicorn!

   How the Church now limps! How deficient in vigor, how weak in her
   actions! If I compare the Church now with the Church in Reformation
   times, when, in our own land, our fathers went bravely to prison and to
   the stake to bear witness to the Lord Jesus! When, in Covenanting
   Scotland and Puritan England, the Truth of God was held with firmness
   and proclaimed with earnestness and, what is, perhaps, still better,
   when the Truth of God was lived by those who professed it--then was she
   mighty, indeed, and not to be compared to "the lame," as I fear she is
   now in these days of laxity of Doctrine and laxity of life--when error
   is tolerated in the Church and loose living is tolerated in the world!

   I might almost use the same simile for the Church, today, as compared
   with those early days of Methodism when Whitefield was flying like a
   seraph in the midst of Heaven--preaching in England and America the
   unsearchable riches of Christ to tens of thousands! When Wesley and
   others were working with undiminished ardor to reach the poorest of the
   poor and the lowest of the low! Those were good days with all their
   faults. Life and fire abounded, the God of Israel was glorified, and
   tens of thousands were converted! The Church seemed as though it had
   risen from the dead and cast off its grave clothes, and was rejoicing
   in newness of life! We are not without hopeful signs today. There is
   not everything to depress, but much to encourage. At the same time, the
   Church limps--she does not stand firm and run fast. Oh, that God would
   be pleased to visit her!

   Moreover, if I look at the text, I perceive that the Church not only is
   sometimes weak, but, at the same time, or at some other time, the
   Church is persecuted and made to suffer, for the text speaks of "the
   outcast." And it has often happened that the Church has been driven
   right out from among men. It has been said of her, "Away with her from
   the earth! It is not fit that she should live." But how wondrously God
   has shown His mercy to His people when they have

   been driven out! The days of exile have been bright days! The sun never
   shone more fairly on the Church's brow than when she worshipped God in
   the catacombs of Rome, or when her disciples "wandered about in
   sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented." In
   our own country, those who met in secret, perpetually pestered by
   informers who would bring them before the magistrate for joining in
   prayer and song, often said, when they got their liberty, that they
   wished they had the days, again, when they were gathered together in
   the lonely house and scarcely dared to sing loudly! They had brave
   times in those days, when every man held his soul in his hand. When he
   worshipped his God not knowing whether the hand of the hangman or the
   headsman might not soon be upon him. The Lord was pleased to bless His
   people when the Church was driven out. If the snowy peaks of Piedmont,
   if the lowlands of Holland, if the prisons of Spain could speak, they
   would tell of Infinite Mercy experienced by the saints under terrible
   oppression--of hearts that were leaping to Heaven while the bodies were
   bruised or burning on earth! God has been gracious to His people when
   they have been driven out.

   Sometimes trouble comes to God's people in another way. The Church is
   afflicted by God Himself It seems as if God had put away His Church for
   a time and driven her from His Presence. That has happened often in all
   Churches. Perhaps some of you are members of such Churches now, or have
   been. Discord has come in and the Spirit of peace has gone. Coldness
   has come into the pulpit and a chill has come over the pews. The Prayer
   Meetings are neglected, the seeking of souls is almost given up--the
   candlestick is there, but the candle seems to be gone, or not to be
   lighted. The means of Grace have become lifeless. You almost dread the
   Sabbath which once was your comfort. It is wretched for Christian
   people when it comes to this! And yet, in scores of villages and towns
   in England this is the case. The sheep look up and the shepherd looks
   down but there is no food for the sheep, neither does the shepherd,
   himself, know where to get the food because he has not been taught of
   God. It is a melancholy thing, wherever this has been the case, but I
   would encourage the saints to cry mightily for the return of God's
   Spirit, for the restoration of unity and peace, earnestness and
   prayerfulness, that once again the wilderness and the solitary place
   may be made glad and the desert may rejoice and blossom like the rose!

   My Brothers and Sisters, may God never treat the Church in England as
   she deserves to be treated, for when I look around me and see her sins,
   they seem to rise up to Heaven like a mighty cry! We have been lately
   told in so many words, by an eminent preacher, that all creeds have
   something good in them--even the creed of the heathen--and that out of
   them all the grand creed is to be made, which is yet to be the religion
   of mankind! God save us from those who talk in this way and yet profess
   to be sent of God! They who know in their own souls what God's Truth
   is, will not be led astray by such delusions. But God may visit His
   Church and chasten her sorely by depriving her of His Spirit for a
   while. If He has done so, or is about to do so, let us still pray that
   He may gather the outcast and afflicted.

   I may not dwell longer upon these points, but hasten to notice the
   blessing that will come, in answer to prayer, upon Churches that are
   weak, or sorely persecuted. There are scattering times, no doubt, but
   we should always pray that we may live in gathering times, that we may
   be gathered together in unity, in essential oneness around the Cross,
   in united action for our glorious Master, and that sinners who are far
   away may be gathered in, too, and backsliders who have wandered may be
   restored! Pray for gathering times, Brothers and Sisters, and may the
   day come when the Lord will assemble the lame and will gather the
   outcast and afflicted.

   Notice that the text speaks of a "day." So we may expect that God will
   have His own time of benediction. "In that day, says the Lord, will I
   assemble the lame." I believe that to be a day in which we enquire
   after the Lord, a day in which we are prayerful, in which we become
   anxious, in which an agony lays hold upon the souls of Believers until
   the Lord shall return unto His people--a day when Christ is revealed in
   the testimony of the Church and the Gospel is fully preached--in that
   day will the Lord assemble the lame! May that day speedily come! But if
   we do not see the blessing tomorrow, let us remember that tomorrow may
   not be God's day, and let us persevere in prayer till God's day does
   come. There are better days in store for the Church--and before the
   page of human history closes, there will be times of triumph for her in
   which she shall be glorious--and God shall be glorified in her!

   II. I shall, however, pass from this first point about the Church,
   because I wish to speak to mourners, to melancholy ones. I trust I have
   a message of mercy to some that are desponding. We shall look on the
   text, secondly, AS REFERRING TO INDIVIDUAL SOULS. "In that day, says
   the Lord, will I assemble the lame." There are three characters
   described here. Let us look at each of them.

   First, the soul that limps. Of course by that is intended those
   Christians who are very weak. Some are "strong in the Lord and in the
   power of His might." It would be a great mercy if all God's people were
   so, but there are some Christians who have faith of but a feeble sort.
   They have love to God, but they sometimes question whether they do love
   Him at all. They have piety in their hearts, but it is not of that
   vigorous kind one would desire. It is rather like the spark in the
   flax, or the music in the bruised reed. They are like Little-Faith and
   Miss Much-Afraid. They are alive, but only just alive. Sometimes their
   life seems to tremble in the balance and yet it is hidden with Christ
   in God and, therefore, it is really beyond the reach of harm! They are
   the weak ones and God speaks to such weak ones, and says, "I will
   assemble the

   lame."

   It not only means that they are weak, but that they are slow and
   limping persons. A lame person cannot travel quickly and, oh, how
   slowly some Christians move! What little advance they make in the
   Divine Life! They were little children ten years ago and they are
   little children now. Their own children have grown up to be men, but
   they themselves do not appear to have made any advance. They are just
   babes in Grace and still have need of milk. They are not strong enough
   to feed upon the strong meat of the Kingdom of God. They are slow to
   believe all that the Prophets and Apostles have spoken, slow to rejoice
   in God, slow to catch a Truth of God and perceive its bearing, but
   still slower to get the nutriment out of it and learn its application
   to themselves. But, slow as they are, I trust we may say of them that
   they are as sure as they are slow! What steps they do take are well
   taken. And if they come slowly, like the snail, yet they are like the
   snail in Noah's days crawling towards the ark--they will eventually get
   in!

   With this slowness there is also pain. A lame man walks painfully.
   Perhaps every time he puts his foot to the ground, a shock of pain goes
   through his whole system. And some Christians, in their progress in the
   heavenly life, seem afflicted in like manner. I meet with some
   Christians who are very sensitive and every time there is anything
   wrong they are ashamed and grieved. I wish some other Christians had
   more of that feeling, for it is an awful fact that many professors seem
   to tamper greatly with sin and think nothing of it at all. Better the
   sensitive soul that is fearful and timorous, lest it should in any way
   grieve the Spirit of God--with a watchful eye over itself and a
   conscience that is quick and tender as the apple of the eye--than such
   presumption and hardness of heart as others have! But some have this
   sensitiveness without the other qualities which balance it--and it
   makes their progress to Heaven a painful one, though a safe one. They
   do not look enough at the Cross. They do not remember that, "if we walk
   in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship, one with
   another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all
   sin." They have not come to see that the Lord Jesus Christ is able to
   deliver us from all sin, so that indwelling sin shall not have dominion
   over us, because we are not under the Law, but under Grace. So their
   progress is painful. But, limping one, this word is for you, "I will
   assemble the lame, when I call My people together, I will call her;
   when I send an invitation to a feast, I will direct one specially to
   her. She is weak, she is slow, she is in pain, but for all that I will
   assemble her with My people."

   The allusion, perhaps, is to a sheep that has somehow been lamed. The
   shepherd has to get all the flock together and, therefore, he must
   bring the lame ones in, too. And the Good Shepherd of the sheep takes
   care that the lame sheep shall be gathered. I find that the original
   word has somewhat of the import of one-sidedness--a lame sheep goes as
   if it went on one side. It cannot use this foot, and so it has to throw
   its weight on the other side. How many Christians there are that have a
   one-sidedness in religion and, unfortunately, that often happens to be
   the gloomy side! They are very properly suspicious of themselves, but
   they do not add to that a weight of confidence in the Lord Jesus
   Christ. Looking back upon their past and seeing their own
   unfaithfulness, they forget God's faithfulness! Looking upon the
   present, they see their own imperfections and infirmities--and forget
   that the Spirit helps our infirmities--and that if we had no
   infirmities, there would be nothing for the Spirit to do to glorify
   Himself in our weakness! When they look forward to the future, they see
   the dragons and the dark river of death, but they forget that promise,
   "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you." What a mercy it
   is that the Lord will not forget these one-sided limpers, but that even
   they shall be assembled when, with the Shepherd's crook, He gathers His
   flock and brings them Home!

   We may add to these, those who have got tired with the trials of the
   way. It is a weary thing to be lame. It saddens my heart to often see
   the sheep go through the London streets. They go limping along, poor
   things, so spent and spiritless. There are many Christians who are like
   they are--they seem to have been so long in trouble that they do not
   know how to bear up any longer. What with the loss of the husband and
   the loss of the child. What with poverty and many struggles and no
   apparent hope of deliverance. What with one sickness and then another
   in their own bodies. What with one temptation and then another
   temptation, and then a third, they feel very wearied by the way. They
   are like Jacob when he limped on his thigh. The blessing is that the
   Lord says, "I will assemble the lame." Lay hold on that, you limping
   ones! I daresay you suppose you are the last one of the flock. You have
   got so tired and lame that you think that though all the others are
   close by the Shepherd's hand, you are forgotten. You remember that the
   Amalekites in the wilderness fell upon the children of Israel and smote
   some of the hindmost of them and, perhaps, you are afraid that you will
   get smitten in that way. Let me remind you of a text--"The Lord will go
   before you, and the God of Israel will be your rereward." Those that
   lead the way can rejoice that God goes before them, but you can rejoice
   that God is behind you, as we read again, "The glory of the Lord shall
   be your rereward." He will take care that you shall not be destroyed.

   But now, secondly, the soul that is exiled--"I will gather the
   outcast." Perhaps I address someone here who has been driven out from
   the world. It was not a very great world, that world of yours, but
   still, it was very dear to you. You loved father, mother, brothers and
   sisters, but you are a speckled bird among them now. Sovereign Grace
   and electing love have lighted on you, but not on them. At first they
   ridiculed you when you went to hear the Gospel--but now that you have
   received it and they perceive that you are in earnest--they persecute
   you. You are one by yourself. You almost wish you did not live among
   them because you are farther off from them than if you were really away
   from them. Nothing you can do pleases them. There are sure to be a
   thousand faults and they fling the taunt at you when you fail, and say,
   "This is your religion!" You cry out, "Woe is me that I dwell in
   Meshech!" Do you remember what became of the man when the Pharisees
   cast him out? Why, the Lord met him and graciously took him in!
   Remember what Jesus said to His disciples, "If you were of the world,
   the world would love his own, but because you are not of the world, but
   I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you."
   When I go to a man's house and his dog barks at me, he does it because
   I am a stranger. And when you go into the world and the world howls at
   you--it is because you are different from worldlings and they recognize
   in you the Grace of God--and pay the only homage which evil is ever
   likely to pay to goodness, namely, persecute it with all their might!

   Perhaps, however, it is worse than that. "I should not mind being
   driven out from the world," you say, "I could take that cheerfully, but
   I seem driven out from the Church of God." There may be two ways in
   which this may come about. Perhaps you have been zealous for the Lord
   God of Israel in the midst of a cold church and you have spoken,
   perhaps not always prudently. The consequence is that you have angered
   and vexed the brethren, and they have thought that you fancied yourself
   to be better than they, though such a thought was far from your mind.
   It is an unfortunate thing for a man to be born before his time, yet he
   may be a grand man. Some Christians in certain churches seem to live
   ahead of their brethren. It is a good thing but, as surely as Joseph
   brought down the enmity of his own brothers upon himself because he
   walked with God and God revealed Himself to him, so is it likely that
   you, if you are in advance of your brethren, will draw down opposition
   upon yourself which will be very bitter. Never mind if the servants
   repulse you! Go and tell their Master--do not go and grumble at them!
   Pray their Master to mend their manners. He knows how to do it!

   But it is just possible that you have been driven out only in your own
   thoughts. Perhaps the members of the church really love you and esteem
   you, and think highly of you. But you have become so depressed in
   spirit that you do not feel that you have any right to be in the
   church. You have made up your mind that you will not be a hypocrite
   and, therefore, you have given up all profession. You have a notion
   that some of your fellow members think evil of you and wonder how ever
   such an one as you can come to the church. Oh, the many poor little
   lambs that come bleating around me with their troubles! And when I tell
   them, "I never heard anything against you in my life! I never heard
   anybody speak of you but with love and respect. I never observed
   anything in you but tenderness of conscience and a quiet holy walk with
   God," they seem quite surprised!

   Brethren, look after your fellow members--do not let them think you are
   cold to them. Some of them will think it whatever you may do. Some of
   you, Brothers and Sisters, are thought to be so proud that you will not
   look at people! If they did but know the truth, they would see that you
   are very different. Now, you lambs, do not be grieved about nothing.
   But you who are stronger than they, mind that you do not give any
   offense that can be prevented. It is impossible but that offenses will
   come, but "woe unto him through whom they come." Let us be careful not
   to break the bruised reed, even by accidentally treading upon it. But,
   dear Brother or Sister, if that is your condition, let me tell you that
   you are not driven out--it is quite a mistake. But if you think so--go
   to your Lord. If you will tell Jesus, He will make up for any apparent
   change that may come over His people.

   Ah, but I think I hear one say, "It is not being driven out from the
   world that hurts me, nor being driven out from the Church. I could bear
   that--but I am driven out from the Lord, Himself! I seem to have lost
   His company and losing that I have lost all--

   "'What peaceful hours I once enjoyed! How sweet their memory still! But
   they have left an aching void The world can never fill.

   Thank God if you feel like that! If the world could fill your heart, it
   would prove that you are no child of God! But if the world cannot fill
   it, then Christ will come and fill it! If you will be satisfied with
   nothing but Him, He will satisfy you. If you are saying, "I will not be
   comforted till Jesus comforts me," you shall get the comfort you need.
   He never left a soul to perish that was looking to Him and longing for
   Him! Cry to Him, again, and this text shall be true to you, "I will
   gather the outcast." May that Word come home to some of you! I do not
   know where you may be, but the Master does-- may He apply the promise
   to your hearts!

   One other person is mentioned here--the soul that is troubled--"those
   whom I have afflicted." Yes, and in all Churches of God there are some
   dear, good friends that are more afflicted than others. They are often
   the best people. Are you surprised at that? Which vine does the
   gardener prune the most? That which bears the most and the sweetest
   fruit! He uses the knife most upon that because it will pay for
   pruning. Some of us seem scarcely to pay for pruning--we enjoy good
   health, but when trial comes, when the Lord prunes us, we may
   say--"Thank God! He means to do something with me after all!"

   Perhaps this afflicted one is afflicted in body--scarcely a day without
   pain, scarcely a day without the prospect of more suffering. Well, if
   there is any child the mother is sure to remember, it is the sick one!
   And if there are any Christians to whom God is peculiarly familiar,
   they are His afflicted ones. "You will make all his bed in his
   sickness," is said concerning a sick saint. The Lord makes your bed,
   dear Brothers and Sisters, if you are suffering bodily pain!

   Some are mentally afflicted. Much of the doubts and fears we hear about
   comes from some degree of mental aberration. The mental trouble may be
   very slight, but it is very common. I suppose that there is not a
   perfectly sane man among us. When that great wind blew, at the time of
   the Fall, a slate blew off everybody's house--and some are more
   affected than others so that they take the black view of all things.
   This mental infirmity, for which they are not to be blamed, will
   probably be with them till they get to Heaven. Well, God blesses those
   who are thus troubled!

   Then some are spiritually afflicted. Satan is permitted to try them
   very much. There is only one way to Heaven, but I find that there is a
   bit of the road that is newly stoned, a harder path to travel on, and
   some persons seem to go to Heaven all over the new stones--their soul
   is perpetually exercised--while God grants to others to choose the
   smoother parts of the way and go triumphantly on. Let those I have
   spoken of hear the Word of promise, "I will gather those whom I have
   afflicted," for when God, Himself, gives the affliction, He will bring
   His servant through and glorify Himself thereby.

   To close, let us regard this promise, "I will gather her," as meaning,
   "I will gather My tried ones into the fellowship of the Church. I will
   bring My scattered sheep near to Me." The Lord Jesus will gather His
   dear people into fellowship with Himself. "I will gather them every day
   around My Mercy Seat. I will gather them, by-and-by, on the other side
   of Jordan, on those verdant hilltops where the Lamb shall forever feed
   His flock and lead them to living fountains of waters." Poor, tried,
   lame, afflicted, limping soul, the Shepherd has not forgotten you! He
   will gather all His sheep and they shall pass again under the hands of
   Him that counts them--there shall not be one missing! I cannot make out
   how some of my Brothers think that the Lord will lose some of His
   people--that there are some whom Jesus has bought with His blood who
   will get lost on the way to Heaven! It is an unhappy shepherd who finds
   some of his flock devoured by the wolf, but our Shepherd will never be
   in that strait with His sheep. He says, "I give unto them eternal life;
   and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My
   hand." What do you say to that, you limping ones? What do you say to
   that, you, the last of all? He has given eternal life to you as much as
   to the strongest of the flock and you shall never perish, neither shall
   any pluck you out of His hand! He will gather you with the rest of His
   sheep.

   And when will He fulfill that promise, Beloved? He is always fulfilling
   it and He will completely fulfill it in the day when He is manifested.
   As this chapter describes Him, when He comes to make peace, and men
   beat their swords into plowshares, then will He gather you. Even now,
   when He comes as the great Peace-Giver, He gathers those whom are

   lame. When the storms of temptation lie still, awhile, and He shows
   Himself in the heart as the God that walked the sea of Galilee of old,
   then are His people gathered into peace--they rest in that day. Thank
   God, the most tried and troubled Believer has some gleams of sunlight.
   In winter time, sometimes, you know there comes a day which looks like
   a summer's day when the gnats come out and think it is spring--and the
   birds begin to sing as if they thought that surely winter was over and
   past! In the darkest experience there are always some blessed gleams of
   light--just enough to keep the soul alive. That is in one measure the
   fulfillment of the promise, "I will assemble the lame...in that day."

   But the day is coming when you and I who have been limping, feeble and
   weak, shall be gathered, never to limp, never to doubt and never to sin
   again! I do not know how long it may be. Some of you are a long way
   ahead of me, according to your years, but we cannot tell. The youngest
   of us may go soonest, for there are last that shall be first, and first
   that shall be last. But there is such a day written in the eternal
   decrees of God when we shall lay aside every tendency to sin, every
   tendency to doubt, every capacity for tribulation, every need for
   chastisement--and then we shall mount and soar away to the bright world
   of endless day! What a mercy it will be to find ourselves there! Oh,
   how we shall greet Jesus with joy and gladness and tell of redeeming
   Grace and dying love that brought Home even the limping ones and the
   weakest and the feeblest!

   I think those that are reckoned strong and do the most for God are
   generally those who think themselves weakest when it comes to the
   stripping time. I read of a man who had been the means of the
   conversion of many hundreds of souls by personal private efforts--I
   refer to Harlan Page. On his dying bed he said, "They talk of me, but I
   am nothing, nothing, nothing." He mourned over his past life--to him it
   seemed that he had done nothing for his Master, that his life was a
   blank. He wept to think he had done so little for Christ while everyone
   was wondering how he had lived such a blessed and holy life! That man
   only is rich towards God who begins to know his emptiness and feels
   that he is less than nothing, and vanity.

   Beloved, it is because those who serve God best often feel that they
   are lame, driven away, afflicted, and tossed with doubts and fears--it
   is because of this that this promise is put to the lowest case and the
   blessing given to the very meanest capacity! It is so in order that one
   who is strong may be able to come in, and when in depression of spirit
   say, "That promise will suit me! I will get a grip of it. I will come
   to God with it in my hands and at the Mercy Seat get it fulfilled to
   me, even to me." The Lord grant you, Beloved, to be numbered among His
   jewels in that day!

   What shall I say to those who know nothing about the Divine Life at
   all, who, perhaps, are saying, "Well, we never get to limping or
   doubting. We have a merry time of it"? Yes and so does the butterfly,
   while the summer lasts, but the winter kills it. Your summer may last a
   little while, but the chill of death will soon be on you--and then what
   is there for you but hopeless misery forever and forever? God give you
   Grace to fly to Jesus now and be saved with an everlasting salvation,
   through Jesus Christ, our Savior! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MCAH4.

   Verse 1. But in the last days it shall come topass that the mountain
   ofthe house ofthe LORD shall be established in the top ofthe mountains,
   and it shall be exalted above the hills and people shall flow unto it
   [See Sermon #249, Volume 5--a vision OF THE LATTER DAY GLORIES.] God's
   cause and Kingdom shall

   not be hidden away in a corner--"the mountain of the house of the Lord
   shall be established in the top of the mountains," an Alp upon other
   Alps, higher than all the other hills! The day is coming when the
   Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ shall be the most conspicuous thing in
   the whole world, "and people shall flow unto it." The heathen, the
   people who knew nothing about it, shall flow to it like a great river!

   2. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the
   mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will
   teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths. That is the way
   the Grace of God works in us--He teaches and then we not only
   learn--but we obey.

   2, 3. For the law shall go forth of Zion, and the Word ofthe LORD from
   Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong
   nations afar off The Kingdom of Christ, the Son of David, shall attract
   people and nations that were far off from the holy city where He lived
   and died.

   3. And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears
   into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation,
   neither shall they learn war anymore. They shall give up the study of
   the art of war. Their spirit shall be softened--in many cases renewed
   by Grace--and then they shall take to the useful arts. They shall not
   throw away their swords, but shall beat them into plowshares. They
   shall not hurl their spears into the earth, but shall bend them into
   scythes or pruning hooks. Oh, that the day were come when the wealth
   and ingenuity and power of nations were used in the pursuits of peace
   instead of in the arts of war! This is the tendency of the Kingdom of
   Christ, for wherever He comes, He makes peace. Nothing is more opposed
   to the spirit of Christianity than war--and when men are Christians,
   not in name only, but in deed and in truth--wars must cease.

   4. But they shall sit, every man under his vine and under his fig tree:
   and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of Hosts has
   spoken it The best evidence that this will be the case is that the Lord
   of Hosts, who has all power at His disposal, has said that it shall be
   so!

   5. For all people will walk, everyone in the name of his god, and we
   will walk in the name ofthe LORD our God forever and ever.When we learn
   to know God in truth, we do not give Him up, but we walk in His name
   forever and ever. God's Covenant with us is an Everlasting Covenant,
   reaching beyond time and enduring throughout eternity. Some nations
   have discarded their idol gods, but those who really know and love the
   Lord will walk in His name forever and ever.

   6. In that day, says the LORD will I assemble the lame. God will bring
   to Himself you that limp, that hesitate, that tremble, that fear--"I
   will assemble the lame."

   6. And I will gather the outcast Hunted by Satan and harassed by care.
   Frightened by depression of spirit. "I will gather the outcast"

   6. And those whom I have afflicted. If God has laid His hand upon one
   of you so that you have a special affliction from Him you have this
   gracious promise that He will gather you to Himself!

   7. And I will make those who limped a remnant, and those who were cast
   far off, a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in Mount
   Zion from henceforth, even forever. Little scattered communities,
   Churches which have been weak and feeble, shall have the strengthening
   of God and they shall be, through His Sovereign Grace, a remnant saved
   by Grace to His praise and Glory! Note how everything here is done by
   God--you keep on reading, "I will," "I will, "I will." Oh, those
   blessed, "I wills" of God! Our wills are often defeated and
   disappointed, but God's, "I wills" stand fast forever!

   8. Andyou, O tower ofthe flock, the stronghold ofthe daughter of Zion,
   unto you shallit come, even the first dominion; the Kingdom shall come
   to the daughter of Jerusalem. So it did. "Beginning at Jerusalem," was
   Christ's order concerning the preaching of the Gospel after His
   Resurrection. The first servants of Christ were of that ancient people
   who might be called the "tower of the flock, the stronghold of the
   daughter of Zion." Oh, that Christ would soon return in mercy to the--

   "Chosen seed of Israel's race, A remnant weak and small"--

   and gather them to Himself, for that would be the fullness of the
   Gentiles, also!

   9. Now why do you cry out aloud? Is there no King in you? Is your
   Counselor perished? Sometimes our prayers may be the utterance of our
   fears rather than of our faith--and then the question comes, "Is there
   no King in you? Is your Counselor perished?" Can we not trust to Him
   whose name is "Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting
   Father, The Prince of Peace"?

   10. For pangs have taken you as a woman in travail.They are sharp
   pangs, but they lead to life and, therefore, they are blessed pangs
   after all!

   10. Be inpain, andlabor to bringforth, O daughter ofZion, like a woman
   in travail: for now shall you go forth out of the city and you shall
   dwell in the field, and you shall go even to Babylon: there shall you
   be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem you from the hand of your
   enemies. It looks more like a threat than a promise that God would send
   His people to Babylon, but there they were to be delivered. And it
   oftentimes happens with us that we must be brought into captivity
   before we are set free--we must feel the weight of the iron bondage of
   sin and Satan before we are brought out into the glorious liberty
   wherewith Christ makes His people free!

   11. Now also many nations are gathered against you that say, Let her be
   defiled, and let our eyes look upon Zion. All the enemies of Israel
   came together, hoping to destroy her. They saw that God had left her
   for a while in their hands, so they maliciously sought her destruction.

   12. But they know not the thoughts of the LORD. They had their own
   thoughts and they thought that the Lord meant what they meant--the
   entire destruction of the chosen race! So the Prophet says, "But they
   know not the thoughts of the Lord"--

   12. Neither understand they His counsel: for He shall gather them as
   the sheaves into the floor. God let them come together, great hosts of
   them, like the sheaves of wheat upon the threshing floor. Then see what
   the Lord says--

   13. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make your horn
   iron, and I will make your hoofs brass; and you shall beat in pieces
   many people. She was to be like the ox that treads out the corn and she
   was to have horns of iron and hoofs of brass with which to break in
   pieces those that had oppressed her!

   13. And I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance
   unto the Lord of the whole earth. So that, when they expected to
   destroy her, she destroyed them! And there may come a day when all the
   great men and the wise men and the proud men of the world will come
   together to destroy the Church of Christ, but, oh, how mistaken they
   will be! For when their pride is at its height, then will the poor weak
   Church of Christ be suddenly strengthened by the Most High and she
   shall tread them under her feet and they shall be utterly defeated to
   the praise of the Glory of the God of Zion who lives forever and ever!

"It Pleased God"

   (No. 3202)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 16, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 19, 1862.

   "It pleased God." Galatians 1:15.

   WE will read the whole verse from which our text is taken--"But when it
   pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by
   His Grace." You will perceive, I think, in these words, that the Divine
   plan of salvation is very clearly laid down. It begins, you see, in the
   will and pleasure of God--"when it pleased God." The foundation of
   salvation is not laid in the will of man. "It is not of him that wills,
   nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy." It does not begin
   with man's obedience and then proceed onward to the purpose of God--but
   here is its commencement, here the fountainhead from which the Living
   Waters flow--"It pleased God." Next to the Sovereign will and good
   pleasure of God comes the act of separation, commonly known by the name
   of election. This act is said, in the text, to take place even in the
   mother's womb, by which we are taught that it took place before our
   birth when as yet we could have done nothing whatever to win it or to
   merit it! God separated us from the earliest part and time of our
   being! And, indeed, long before that, when as yet the mountains and
   hills were not piled and the oceans were not formed by His creative
   power, He had, in His eternal purpose, set us apart for Himself. Then,
   after this act of separation came the effectual calling--"and called me
   by His Grace." The calling does not cause the election--the election,
   springing from the Divine purpose, causes the calling! The calling
   comes as a consequence of the Divine purpose and the Divine separation,
   and you will note how the obedience follows the calling. The Apostle
   does not begin to be a preacher, according to the purpose and will of
   God, until first of all the Spirit of God has called him out of his
   state of nature into a state of Grace. So the whole process runs
   thus--first the sacred, Sovereign purpose of God, then the distinct and
   definite election or separation, then the effectual and irresistible
   calling and then afterwards, the obedience unto life, and the sweet
   fruits of the Spirit which spring from there. They err, not knowing the
   Scriptures, who put any of these processes before the others, out of
   the Scriptural order. They who put man's will first, know not what they
   say, nor whereof they affirm, for it is not of the will of man, says
   the Apostle in the most peremptory and positive manner--the salvation
   of any soul is a display of the eternal purpose and Sovereign will of
   God!

   And, Beloved, by this test may we know the certainty of our election,
   if we have obediently yielded to the call of God. If the Divine calling
   has produced in us the fruit of obedience, then we may assuredly
   believe that we were separated unto God before time began, and that
   this separation was according to the eternal purpose and will of God!
   Like golden links of a chain, any one of these will draw on the others.
   Am I justified? Then I was called by God's Grace. Am I called? Then I
   was predestined to be called and, on the other hand, if I was
   predestined, then I shall be called, being called, I shall be
   justified, being justified, I shall be glorified! I think I have used
   this illustration before. On that bank of the great river of time is
   the massive pillar of Divine Foreknowledge and Predestination, and on
   the other side of the river is the equally massive pillar of
   Glorification. How are we to bridge these two? Both of these pillars
   are in the mists and clouds of eternity, but these stupendous chains
   stretch right across the intervening chasm--"Whom He did foreknow, He
   also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He
   might be the first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did
   predestinate, them He also called: and whom He called, them He also
   justified: and whom He justified, them He also glorified." If I want to
   know what my relation is to Predestination way over yonder in the past,
   I think of my calling, for I have been called, and so I am linked with
   the past! And if I want to know whether I shall be glorified, I know
   that, also, by the fact that I am today justified. So, as I stand here,
   I am linked with both the past and the future--

   linked so perfectly that neither time, nor life, nor death, nor Hell
   shall ever be able to break the bonds that bind me equally to the
   Predestination in the past and the Glorification in the future! You see
   then, dear Friends, that from this verse, as a whole, we learn the
   Divine plan of salvation! And by it we may judge as to our own interest
   in it. But now, leaving the rest of the verse, let us consider the
   three words that form our text. "It pleased God." I. First, we have
   here THE FOUNDATION OF DIVINE GRACE.

   The reason why Paul was saved was this--"It pleased God." And the only
   reason why you or I will ever enter Heaven must be this--"It pleased
   God." You can clearly perceive, in the Apostle's case, that there could
   be no other reason. It could not be because of any merit of his that he
   was saved, for what was he? A blasphemer, he says, and a persecutor--
   so thirsty for the blood of saints that even in his younger days, he
   guarded the clothes of the murderers who stoned Stephen. Afterwards, he
   hated men and women, and committed them to prison, and compelled them
   to blaspheme, "and being"--to use his own expressive
   words--"exceedingly mad against them," he "persecuted them even unto
   strange cities." There could be nothing in that persecuting Jew, whose
   very breath was full of threats, and whose heart was like a furnace of
   fury against the saints--there could be nothing in him which could be a
   reason why God should save him! If saved, it must be because "it
   pleased God."

   And, most decidedly, there was no co-action of the Apostle's will
   tending to his conversion. You remember the scene. I see him there,
   upon his proud charger, riding onward toward Damascus. He has in his
   possession letters which he treasures more than gold, for they give him
   the permission of the high priest to seize the saints at Damascus and
   carry them bound to Jerusalem. He rides on proudly, yonder is the city
   glittering in the sun, and he is meditating upon the deeds of blood and
   fury he will perform there--who can stop that man? But at midday God
   arrests him! "A light from Heaven, above the brightness of the sun,"
   shines upon him. The men that are with him see the light, but they know
   not what it is. He falls to the ground and a Voice cries to him from
   Heaven, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?" He enquires, "Who are
   You, Lord?" The answer comes, "I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is
   hard for you to kick against the pricks," like an ox kicking against
   the sharp goad. He rises blind, yet seeing more than he ever saw
   before! He goes into Damascus, not to hunt Christ's disciples, but to
   learn from Ananias the Good News that Christ's pardon may be given even
   to him! In three days' time, he is converted, baptized into the name of
   Christ, comes forth to tell the little Church at Damascus what God has
   done for his soul and in the synagogues preaches that Christ is the Son
   of God! What reason can there be why this persecutor of the saints
   should have been saved but this--"It pleased God"?

   Do not imagine that this is an exceptional experience. On the contrary,
   such cases occur every day! Many come into this place of worship as
   skeptics and go out sincere Believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. Some
   have I known who have come here only to laugh and scoff, but they have
   remained to pray. No thought was further from their mind than that they
   should ever become the followers of the Lamb--but the Divine power,
   which was not necessarily connected with the preacher--carried the Word
   into their hearts, arrested them on the spot, changed their natures,
   made them new creatures in Christ Jesus and sent them on their way
   rejoicing in their newly-found Savior! And I am sure that all such
   persons will bear their willing witness that they can see no reason but
   for the Grace which was bestowed on them but this -- "It pleased God."

   There are some whose lives have proved how sinful their nature was, for
   their sin has taken the form of open and gross vice. They are like that
   woman in the city who was a sinner. And as they resemble her in their
   sin, I trust that they will also resemble her in their love and be
   ready to wash the Savior's feet with their tears, and wipe them with
   the hairs of their heads! There may be some who are now truly
   converted, who have sinned as deeply as even Saul of Tarsus did. Then
   let them acknowledge, as he did, that their conversion was due to the
   undeserved favor of God! John Bradford's saying has often been quoted,
   but it will bear repeating again and again. He lived in a house past
   which people used to be taken on the way to Tyburn to be hanged. And in
   those cruel times there were many poor wretches thus hurried out of
   existence--some of them for crimes which are far more leniently
   punished now. As the honest preacher saw them pass his house, he said,
   "There goes John Bradford but for the Grace of God." He felt that he
   was, by nature, capable of doing just what they had done, and that only
   Divine Grace had made him to differ from them. And when I hear or read
   of some atrocious sinner, I say to myself, "That man is what I might
   have been if God had left me to take my own course, for by nature I am
   no better than he is. I might not have fallen into his special form of
   sin, for the bent of my constitution may not be in that particular
   direction, but I might have committed some other sin which would have
   been quite as bad as

   his." One vessel may leak at the bow and another may leak at the stern,
   but it does not much matter where the leak is--in either case the
   vessel will sink.

   And those of you who have been converted as the result of a regular
   attendance at the House of Prayer, when you come to remember how many
   others who are still unregenerate, who have been sitting side by side
   with you, you can only say, as you think who caused you to differ from
   them--"It pleased God." How often one is taken and the other left! Two
   women come up to worship at the same time and sit under the sound of
   the same message--one retires impenitent, the other's heart is broken.
   As we note the contrast between them, we can only stand and, holding up
   our hands in wonder, say, "What is the reason for this difference,
   Lord? There can be none except that so it seemed good in Your sight."

   I know that there are many who the moment they hear this Doctrine
   proclaimed, begin to quibble at it and quarrel with it. They do not
   think that God should thus do as He pleases in the work of salvation!
   But let me tell them that it is because they care not for God that they
   feel as they do in this matter. Opposition to Divine Sovereignty is
   essentially atheism. Men have no objection to a god who is really no
   God! I mean by this, a god who shall be the subject of their fancy, who
   shall be a lackey to their will, who shall be under their control--they
   have no objection to such a being as that! But a God who speaks and it
   is done! Who commands and it stands fast! A God who has no respect for
   their persons, but does as He wills among the armies of Heaven and
   among the inhabitants of this lower world--such a God as this they
   cannot endure! And yet, is it not essential to the very Being of God
   that He should be absolute and supreme? Certainly, to the Scriptural
   conception of God, Sovereignty is an absolute necessity!

   Let me say, then, to those who quarrel with the Lord for doing as He
   pleases in the conversion of sinners that first, He has the right to do
   so through His own inherent Sovereignty. He made men and He has the
   right to do with them just as He pleases. "Has not the potter power
   over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honor, and
   another unto dishonor?" If any man says to God, "Why have You made me
   thus?" The only answer is, "No, but, O man, who are you that replies
   against God?" Dread, mysterious and profound as the Doctrine of Divine
   Sovereignty is, yet it certainly must be acknowledged that He who is
   God has an absolute and inherent right to do as He wills with all those
   whom He has, Himself, created--

   "Mortals, be dumb! What creature dares Dispute His awful will? Ask no
   account of His affairs, But tremble and be still."

   But some of your animosity to this Doctrine may perhaps be melted if
   you recollect that God's Sovereignty is never displayed apart from His
   righteousness! To entrust a man with absolute power would be most
   dangerous, for he is fallible. But to entrust absolute Holiness and
   Righteousness with absolute power is the safest way of governing the
   whole universe. God cannot do an unrighteous thing, therefore let Him
   do whatever He wills! Who would wish to limit One whose acts must be
   from the very Character that is essential to His Being, just and true?
   No man who is lost will ever be able to blame God's Sovereignty for it.
   The man that perishes shall justly perish because of his sins. And in
   Hell, this shall be to him the pang of pangs--that he cannot reproach
   God, but that his damnation lies at his own door since he incensed the
   Justice of God, which must punish him for his sin. And in like manner,
   the saints in Heaven, though saved as the result of Divine Sovereignty,
   may boast that that Sovereignty never violated Justice, for, before God
   would bring one of them to Heaven, He gave His Son to bleed and die
   that the demands of Justice might be fully met before the sinner was
   saved!

   I will venture to go even further than this and to say that the
   Sovereignty of God is never exercised apart from His mercy and His
   benevolence. We know that "God is Love," and who would limit love? As
   "God is Love," let Him be absolute, for He will assuredly do that
   which, on the whole, is the best for all His creatures, as well as most
   for the Glory of His own perfect Character. Then, as this is the case,
   how ought we to delight to think that God is free and bound by no law
   but His own will, which is the fountain of all law, and constrained by
   no necessity but the carrying out of His own eternal purpose of love
   and mercy!

   I feel sure that much of the opposition to the doctrine of Divine
   Sovereignty springs from a misunderstanding of God. I know that some
   misrepresent this Truth of God as though God were an almighty tyrant,
   but Scripture gives no warrant for such a caricature. And I again
   enter, as I have already often entered, my earnest protest against such
   an insult

   to my God! When any man perishes, lay not his blood at God's door. If
   any man is lost, his ruin is caused by himself and not to be laid to
   the charge of our ever-gracious God. Yet remember, at the same time,
   that if any are saved, the glory of their salvation must be ascribed to
   God! I am often asked, "How do you make those two statements consistent
   with one another?" But that question does not perplex me, for I do not
   see how they are inconsistent with each other. Someone says, "But I do
   not understand this Doctrine." Perhaps not, but remember that while we
   are bound to tell you the Truths of God, we are not bound to give you
   the power to understand them. And besides, this is not a subject for
   understanding--it is a matter for believingbecause it is revealed in
   the Word of God! It is one of the axioms of theology that if a man is
   lost, God must not be blamed for it. And it is also an axiom of
   theology that if a man is saved, God must have all the glory of it.
   That "salvation is of the Lord" is as plainly revealed in Scripture as
   anything that we see in nature! And that destruction is of man, is
   equally plain, both from the nature of things and from the teaching of
   Scripture! Hold the two Truths of God--do not try to run to the
   extreme, either of the Hyper-Calvinist or of the ultra-Arminian. There
   is some truth in Calvinism and some in Arminianism, and he who would
   hold the whole Truth of God must neither be cramped by the one system
   nor bound by the other, but take Truth wherever he can find it in the
   Bible--and leave it to the God of Truth to show him, when he gets into
   another world, anything that is beyond his comprehension now. At all
   events, I have laid this down very plainly and I think every converted
   person must agree with it, that if any of us are saved, the explanation
   of our conversion is the same as the explanation of Paul's--"It pleased
   God."

   II. Now, secondly, I shall use the text in another way. We have, here,
   GROUNDS FOR HUMILITY.

   Paul was a preacher, but why was he a preacher? Because "it pleased
   God." You are a deacon, or you are an elder, or you are a minister--is
   there any ground for boasting here? Who made you what you are? "It
   pleased God." That is the only possible explanation! Had God willed it,
   you might have been sweeping a crossing. You might have been at this
   moment in some tavern groveling in drunkenness. You might have been a
   miserable wretch in prison. Any honorable office that you hold in the
   Church is the result, not of your meriting it, but of God's
   graciousness towards you in having put you where you are. The angels in
   Heaven are humble because they remember who made them and kept them
   angels, for they would have been devils in Hell if God had not
   preserved them in their first estate. In like manner, office in the
   Church is a ground for humility, not for boasting! If we are thus
   favored, it is because "it pleased God." The Apostle was also a great
   laborer. He could truthfully say, "I labored more abundantly than they
   all." What then? Was that a reason for boasting? By no means, for he
   added, "yet not I, but the Grace of God which was with me." Are you
   passionately zealous for the conversion of men? Do you labor both by
   night and by day to propagate the Truth of God and to bring sinners to
   the Cross of Christ? Then continue in your noble employment, but do not
   plume yourself upon this as though you deserved some praise from God
   for it! Remember that every virtue you possess, everything about you
   that is pure, and lovely, and of good report, has come to you because
   "it pleased God."

   Paul was, moreover, a most successful preacher. Thousands acknowledged
   him as their spiritual father. Through a great part of Asia, through
   Greece and Italy, probably onward through Spain and, perhaps, even in
   Great Britain, there were found traces of the victorious march of this
   great soldier of the Cross! Wherever he went, he confounded the
   reason-er, put to silence the boaster, made the heathen feel that one
   had come among them who would hurl their idols from their pedestals! He
   came like John the Baptist, casting down the high hills and filling up
   the valleys to make straight a highway for his God, yet I never find
   him boasting of all this, but, laying all his honors at Jehovah's feet,
   he said, "By the Grace of God I am what I am," or, in the words of our
   text, "It pleased God."

   There are some people in the world who are constantly warning some of
   us against pride and we are duly thankful for their warnings--they are,
   no doubt, greatly needed--and it is very generous on their part to
   bestow them upon us, especially as some of them sorely need the
   warnings themselves! I remember some time ago receiving a warning
   against pride from a Christian woman who told me that she would pray
   that I might be kept humble. I thanked her and told her that I should
   do the same for her, whereupon she said that she did not require it,
   for she had no temptation to be proud, she had nothing to be proud of
   and, therefore, she was quite sure she would never be proud. Then I
   told her gently but decidedly, that I thought she was already proud, or
   else she would not have uttered such a speech as that! I added that God
   had His own way of keeping humble those whom He calls to stand in
   conspicuous places--and His usual way was by chastening them in private
   when their people knew nothing about it. And I also said that it was
   quite as easy to be proud and to do nothing as to be proud and to do
   much. Oh, dear, the lay ministers that I have seen who seemed to have
   had

   their backs made of cast iron--idle preachers who would scarcely bring
   one soul to Christ in a century! Yet they were so dignified and
   maintained "the dignity of their profession" with such vigor that there
   seemed to be every reason to expect that they would die of dignity one
   of these days, like the Spanish monarch who perished because his chair
   was too near the fire! It was not according to court etiquette that he
   should move it, himself, or that he should ring the bell for anybody
   else to do it and, therefore, he sat still till he brought on a fever
   by which he afterwards lost his life. If we have nothing, we should be
   humble because of our poverty--and if we have much, we ought to be
   humble because we are so much in debt to God! A man who owes £10,000
   has no cause to crow over his fellow debtor who owes far less than he
   does. He would be foolish if he said, "I have more to be proud of than
   you have, for I owe £10,000, but you only owe £100." Why, that would be
   the reason why he should hang his head down still lower! And so should
   it be with the man whom God greatly honors. This should be the reason
   for keeping himself very humble because he knows--and God will make him
   remember it, too--that if there is any difference between him and other
   men, it is only because "it pleased God." III. Now I am going to use
   our text in a third way as A REASON FOR COURAGE.

   I should like to see more of this virtue than we see nowadays. We live
   in an age which needs to have a large infusion of the heroic martyr
   spirit which enabled our forefathers to go boldly to the block or to
   the stake for Christ's sake. We may well blush as we see how many
   professors are ashamed of the religion which they are supposed to have
   received. If they are called to do some work for Christ, how often do
   they stop and parley, and question, and hesitate and, at last, when
   they have summoned up enough courage to come forward, it is only with
   an apology upon their lips for daring to do something for Jesus! I
   heard one say of a certain preacher, "I greatly admired him, for he
   commenced his sermon by saying, 'Permit a young man to address you.'" I
   said, "That is not the way God's servants ought to talk. If God has
   given them anything to say for Him, they have not to ask anybody's
   permission to say it, nor should they apologize to anybody for saying
   it as God enables them to say it." Apologies are out of place in the
   pulpit! The man whom God sends to speak for Him is God's ambassador--he
   has no right to apologize for delivering his Lord's message! He who
   professes to be sent of God either is or is not God's ambassador. If he
   is not, let him at once take himself off the pulpit! If he is his
   Master's accredited representative, he needs no excuse and should make
   none.

   I think it will make us courageous and help us to do exploits for God
   if we can feel that we do our work because it pleases God. I have never
   approved of the warfare of the old Commonwealth days. I do not believe
   that, after all, England gained much by fighting. Under Cromwell, she
   gained liberty for a time, but it was soon lost again, as liberty
   always must be if it is only won by the sword. But mark you, I must say
   this--that which made Cromwell so mighty was the firm conviction that
   "it pleased God" to make him the leader of the Ironsides! And that
   which made his soldiers victorious on so many hard-fought fields was
   that they also felt that "it pleased God." To them it was not a
   question as to whether it was lawful to fight--they had made up their
   minds about that matter. Taking out their little soldiers' Bible, they
   read some fiery Psalm. And having read it, their blood boiled and, as
   the old Crusaders cried, "Deus vult,"--"God wills it"--they shouted
   their battle cry, "The Lord of Hosts," and dashed into the fight! And
   they were victorious because they felt that "it pleased God." And now,
   today, battling inch by inch, and contending hour by hour against the
   leaguered hosts of sin, you and I can never be mighty if we only stand
   in our own strength and question our call to be soldiers of the Cross!
   But if we felt that each blow that we strike pleases God--and if in
   every advance we make into the enemy's territory we can say, "It
   pleases God," and if our war cry as we dash to the conflict is, "It
   pleases God"--then we shall feel the earth shake again beneath the
   tramp of the heroes' feet and we shall see the Church of God as she
   should be--"fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army
   with banners." Why, even the power of the Crusaders arose from the fact
   that they thought the Crusaders "pleased God."

   Brothers and Sisters, we must get back this old enthusiasm if ever our
   land is to be swept clear of Popery! If ever Europe is to become free
   with God's freedom, if ever Africa is to have the light of the Truth of
   God driving away her dense darkness, if ever Asia, America and
   Australia are to be won for the Lord Jesus Christ, they whom God has
   called to the conflict must fight because it pleases God! Surely none
   of you who profess to be Christ's will be content unless you do
   something to help toward this great end because it pleases God! As you
   come to the Communion Table, realize that God is within you, making
   your body His Throne and enabling you to carry out your great life
   purpose of glorifying God in your body and in your spirit which are
   His. Do all that you do because it pleases God! If His Spirit shall
   help you to feel and act thus, blessed shall it be both for the Church
   and for the world!

   My time has gone, yet I am not nearly done, so I must give you the rest
   in brief. Here is AN ARGUMENT FOR PATIENCE. "It pleased God." The cup
   is bitter, the knife is sharp, the bit is hard, the bereavement is
   sore, but as it pleases God, we kiss the rod and patiently bow to our
   Father's will.

   Then, next, we have here A SUGGESTION FOR HOPE. If it pleased God to
   save Saul of Tarsus--and if the only reason why He should save him was
   because He pleased to do it--then why cannot He save you? Have you been
   a drunkard? Have you dived into the foul slough of lust? Have you
   defiled yourself by dishonesty? Still, if it pleases God, He can save
   you! Now I know it pleases God to save everyone who trusts in Christ.
   Then if you trust in Christ, you are saved! Awake, O man! Awake, O
   woman and let this be your language--"I am the chief of sinners, but it
   pleased God to save another who called himself the chief of sinners,
   so--

   'I'll to the gracious King approach, Whose scepterpardon gives. Perhaps
   He may command my touch, And then the suppliant lives.'" If you will
   thus cast yourself upon the Sovereign mercy of God in Christ Jesus, it
   will please God and you shall be saved!

   And then, last of all, our text is A MOTIVE FOR HOLINESS AND ZEAL. If
   "it pleased God" and, therefore, He saved me when there was no reason
   in me why I should be saved. If He loved me when I was filthy--now that
   I have been washed I would be filthy no more--and in holiness I will
   seek to show my gratitude to Him! If He loved me when I was dead, now
   that He has made me alive I will not be lifeless and cold, but full of
   zeal and fire for Him! I do not know how to press this last point
   unless I get back to the one I was urging upon you just now. If you
   feel that God has willed that you should be saved and that God wills
   that you should be the means of saving others--that God wills that you
   should become a spiritual father or mother in Israel--then I know that
   your heart will boil over with holy zeal and that you will go forth as
   a conqueror who has the certainty of victory already in his heart! God
   shall be with you and you shall go on conquering and to conquer! The
   Lord add His blessing for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: GALATIANS 1:11-24; 2.

   Galatians 1:11-17. But I make known to you, brethren, that the Gospel
   that was preached by me is not after man. For Ineither received it from
   man, neither was I taught it but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ For
   you have heard of my conversation in timepast in the Jews 'religion,
   how that beyond measure Ipersecuted the Church of God, and wasted it:
   and profited in the Jews 'religion above many my equals in my own
   nation, being more exceedingly jealous of the traditions of my fathers.
   But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and
   called me by His Grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach
   Him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and
   blood: neither went I up to Jerusalem to them who were Apostles before
   me; but I went up to Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.Paul was
   intensely desirous that the Galatian Christians should understand that
   he was no mere repeater of other men's doctrines, but that what he
   taught he had received directly from God by supernatural Revelation.
   They knew that he had been a most determined opposer of the Gospel.
   Indeed, he was a man of such great determination that whatever he did,
   he did with all his might! So, no sooner did God reveal Christ to him,
   so that he knew Jesus to be the Messiah, than he earnestly sought to
   learn yet more of the Truth of God, not by going up to the Apostles at
   Jerusalem, to borrow from them, but by getting alone in the waste
   places of Arabia! There, by thought and meditation upon the Word, and
   by communion with God, to learn yet more concerning the Divine
   mysteries.

   18-24. Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to see Peter, and
   abode with him fifteen days. But others of the Apostles I saw none,
   save James, the Lord's brother. Now the things which I write unto you,
   behold, before God, I lie not. Afterwards I came into the regions of
   Syria and Cilicia; and was unknown by face unto the Churches of Judaea
   which were in Christ: but they had heard only that he which persecuted
   us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed. And
   they glorified God in me.

   Galatians 2:1, 2. Then fourteen years later, I went up again to
   Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. And I went up by
   revelation he was sent by the Church at Antioch, but the Church there
   was guided by Revelation, so that Paul is correct in saying, "I went up
   by revelation"--

   2-4. And communicated unto them that Gospel which I preach among the
   Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any
   means I should run, or had run, in vain. Yet not even Titus, who was
   with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: and that
   because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to
   spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might
   bring us into bondage. There were always some among the Jewish converts
   who insisted that the Gentiles should come under the seal of the Old
   Covenant if they were to be partakers of the blessings of the Gospel.
   But to this Paul would never consent--

   5. To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the
   truth of the Gospel might continue with you. It is impossible for us to
   estimate how much we owe to the Apostle Paul! Of all who have ever
   lived, we who are Gentiles owe more to him than to any other man! See
   how he fought our battles for us. When our Jewish brethren would have
   excluded us because we were not of the seed of Abraham according to the
   flesh, how bravely did he contend that if we were partakers of the same
   faith--Abraham is the father of all the faithful, that he was loved of
   God and the Covenant was made with him, not in circumcision, but before
   he was circumcised--then we are partakers of that Covenant!

   6-10. But of these who seemed to be something, (whatever they were, it
   makes no matter to me: God shows personal favoritism to no man) for
   they who seemed to be something added nothing to me: but on the
   contrary, when they saw that the Gospel of the uncircumcision was
   committed unto me, as the Gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter,
   (for He worked effectually in Peter to the Apostleship of the
   circumcision, the same was mighty to me toward the Gentiles), and when
   James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the Grace
   that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of
   fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the
   circumcision. Only they would that we should remember the poor; the
   same which I also was forward to do. [See Sermon #99, Volume 2--the
   duty of

   REMEMBERING THE POOR.] One of the first things he did, when there

   was a famine in Judaea, was to make a collection for the saints in
   other places, that he might aid the poor Christians.

   11-14. But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face,
   because he was to be blamed. For before certain men came from James, he
   did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and
   separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. And the
   other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas, also,
   was carried away with their dissimulation. But when I saw that they
   walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel, I said unto
   Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of
   Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live
   as do the Jews?It must have been very painful to Paul's feelings to
   come into conflict with Peter, whom he greatly esteemed. But for the
   Truth's sake, he knew no persons, and he had to withstand even a
   beloved Brother when he saw that he was likely to pervert the
   simplicity of the Gospel and rob the Gentiles of their Christian
   liberty! For this we ought to be very grateful to our gracious God who
   raised up this brave champion, this beloved Apostle of the Gentiles!

   15, 16. We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
   knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by
   faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we
   might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the
   Law: for by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified. No mere
   man can keep the Law of God--no mere man has ever done so. We have all
   sinned and come short of the glory of God! And as an absolutely perfect
   obedience is demanded by the Law, which knows nothing of mercy, we fly
   from the Law to obtain salvation by the Grace of God in Christ Jesus!

   17. But if, while we seek to bejustified by Christ, we ourselves also
   are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid
   That would not be caused by the Gospel, but by our disregard of it.

   18, 19. For I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a
   transgressor. For I through the Law am dead to the Law, that I might
   live unto God. "Through my sight of the Law, which I have seen to be so
   stern that all it can do is to condemn me for my shortcomings, I am
   driven away from it and led to come and live in Christ Jesus under the
   rule of Grace--not under the law of Moses."

   20, 21. I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless Ilive; yet not I, but
   Christ lives in me: and the life which Inow live in the flesh Ilive by
   the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me. I
   do not frustrate the Grace of God: for if righteousness comes by the
   Law, then Christ is dead in vain.

Christ Made Sin

   (No. 3203)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 23, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For He hats made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might
   be made the righteousness of God in Him." 2 Corinthians 5:21.

   I DARESAY I have preached from this text several times in your hearing.
   If my life is spared, I hope to

   preach from it twice as many more! The Doctrine it teaches, like salt
   upon the table, must never be left out--or, like bread, which is the
   staff of life--it is proper at every meal.

   See you here the foundation Truth of Christianity, the Rock on which
   our hopes are built! It is the only hope of a sinner, and the only true
   joy of the Christian--the great transaction, the great Substitution,
   the great lifting of sin from the sinner to the sinner's Surety--the
   punishment of the Surety instead of the sinner--the pouring out of the
   vials of wrath which were due to the transgressor, upon the head of his
   Substitute! It is the most grand transaction which ever took place on
   earth! It is the most wonderful sight that even Hell ever beheld and
   the most stupendous marvel that Heaven, itself, ever executed--Jesus
   Christ, made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God
   in Him!

   You scarcely need that I should explain the words when the sense is so
   plain. A spotless Savior stands in the place of guilty sinners. God
   lays upon the spotless Savior, the sin of the guilty, so that He
   becomes, in the expressive language of the text, sin. Then He takes off
   from the innocent Savior His righteousness and puts that to the account
   of the once-guilty sinners, so that the sinners become
   righteousness--righteousness of the highest and most Divine source--the
   righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.

   Of this transaction I would have you think tonight. Think of it
   adoringly! Think of it lovingly! Think of it joyfully!

   I. When you look at the great Doctrine of Substitution, you especially
   who are concerned in it and can see your sins laid upon Christ, I want
   you to LOOK AT IT WITH DEVOUT ADORATION.

   Lowly and reverently adore the Justice of God. God set His heart upon
   saving your souls, but He would not be unjust, even to indulge His
   favorite attribute of Mercy. He had purposed that you should be His--He
   had set His love upon you, unworthy as you are, before the foundation
   of the world! Yet to save you, He would not tarnish His Justice. He had
   said, "The soul that sins, it shall die," and He would not recall the
   word because it was not too severe, but simply a just and righteous
   threat. Sooner than He would tarnish His Justice, He bound His
   only-begotten Son to the pillar and scourged and bruised Him! Sooner
   than sin should go unpunished, He put that sin upon Christ and punished
   Him--oh, how tremendously and with what terrific strokes! Christ can
   tell you, but probably if He did tell you, you could not understand all
   that God thinks about sin, for God hates it, loathes it and must and
   will punish it! And upon His Son He laid a tremendous, incomprehensible
   weight, till the griefs of the dying Redeemer utterly surpassed all our
   imagination or comprehension! Adore, then, the Justice of God, and
   think how you might have had to adore it, not at the foot of the Cross,
   but in the depths of Hell! O my Soul, if you had had your deserts, you
   would have been driven from the Presence of God! Instead of looking
   into those languid eyes which wept for you, you would have had to look
   into His face whose eyes are as a flame of fire! Instead of hearing Him
   say, "I have blotted out your sins," you might have heard Him say,
   "Depart, you cursed one, into everlasting fire." Will you not pay as
   much reverence to the Justice of God exhibited on the Cross as
   exhibited in Hell? Let your reverence be deeper! It will not be that of
   a slave, or even of a servant, but let it be quite as humble. Bow low,
   bless the Justice of God, marvel at its severity, adore its unlimited
   holiness, join with seraphs

   who surely at the foot of the Cross may sing, as well as before the
   Throne of God, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts."

   While you admire the Justice, also admire the Wisdom of God. We ought
   to adore God's Wisdom in everything we see in Creation. The physician
   with his scalpel should adore the Wisdom of God in the anatomical skill
   by which the human body is formed and fashioned. The traveler, as he
   passes through the wonders of Nature, should adore the Wisdom of God in
   the creation of the world, with its towering mountains and with its
   unknown depths. Every student of the works of God should account the
   universe as a temple in which the gorgeous outline does not excel the
   beauty and the holiness of all its fittings, for in the Temple
   everything speaks of Jehovah's Glory. But, ah, at the foot of the
   Cross, Wisdom is concentrated--all its rays are concentrated there as
   with a magnifying glass. We see God there reconciling contrary
   attributes as they appear to us. We see God there "glorious in
   holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders," and yet "forgiving
   iniquity, and transgression, and sin." He smites as though He were
   cruel. He forgives as though He were not just. He is as generous in
   passing by sin as if He were not the Judge of all the earth. He is as
   severe to punish sin as if He were not the tender Father who can press
   the prodigal to His bosom. Here you see Love and Justice embrace each
   other in such a wondrous way that I ask you to imitate the seraphs who
   now that they see what they once desired to look into, veil their faces
   with their wings, adoring the only wise God!

   Further, Beloved, when you have thus thought of His Justice and of His
   Wisdom, bow your head again in reverence as you contemplate the Grace
   of God. For what reason did God give His only-begotten Son to bleed
   instead of us? We were worms of insignificance, we were vipers of
   iniquity--if He saved us, were we worth the saving? We were such
   infamous traitors that if He doomed us to the eternal fire, we might
   have been terrible examples of His Wrath, but Heaven's Darling bleeds
   that earth's traitors may not bleed! Shout it! Shout it in Heaven and
   publish it in all the golden streets every hour of every glorious day,
   that such is the Grace of God, "that He gave His only-begotten Son,
   that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life."

   And here, while I ask you to adore, I feel inclined to close the sermon
   and to bow myself in silence before the Grace of God in Christ Jesus.
   "Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us!" Behold
   it in the sweat of blood which stained Gethsemane! Behold it in the
   scourging which has made the name of Gabbatha a terror! Behold it in
   "the pains, and groans, and dying strife" of Calvary! Bow, did I say?
   Prostrate your spirits! Lift up your sweetest music, but let your soul
   feel the deepest abasement as you see this super abounding Grace of God
   in the Person of the Only-Begotten of the Father, making Him to be sin
   for us--He who knew no sin!

   When you have thus thought of His Justice, His wisdom and His Grace,
   like a silver thread running through the whole, I want you once more to
   adore His Sovereignty. What Sovereignty is this, that angels who fell
   should have no Redeemer, but that man, insignificant man, being fallen,
   should find a Savior in Heaven's Only-Begotten! See this Sovereignty,
   too, that this precious blood should come to some of us and not to
   others! Millions in this world have never heard of it. Tens of
   thousands who have heard of it, have rejected it. Yes, and in this
   little section of the world's population encompassed now within these
   walls, how many there are who have had that precious blood preached in
   their hearing and presented to them with loving invitations, only to
   reject it and despise it? And if you and I have felt the power of it,
   and can see the blood cleansing us from sin, shall we not admire that
   discriminating, distinguishing Grace which has made us to differ? But
   the part of Sovereignty which astonishes me most is that God should
   have been pleased to make Him who knew no sin to be sin for us," that
   God should be pleased to ordain salvation by Christas our Substitute!

   A great many persons rail at this plan of salvation, but if God has
   determined it, you and I ought to accept it with delight. "Behold,"
   says God, "I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious." The
   Sovereignty of God has determined that no man can be saved except by
   the atoning Sacrifice of Christ. If any man would be clean, Jehovah
   declares that he must wash in the fountain which Jesus filled from His
   veins. If God should put away sin and accept the sinner, He declares
   that it should only be through that sinner putting his trust in the
   Sacrifice offered once and for all by the Lord Jesus Christ upon the
   Cross. Admire this Sovereignty and adore it by yielding to it! Cavil
   not at it. Down, rebellious will! Hush, you naughty reason that would
   ask, "Why?" and, "Why is there no other method?" Yield, my heart! "Kiss
   the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish from the way, when His wrath
   is kindled but a little." Oh, magnificent love! A way as splendid as
   the end! A plan as glorious as its design! The design to save is not
   more resplendent than the method by which men

   are saved. Justice is magnified, Wisdom extolled, Grace resplendent,
   and every attribute of God glorified! Oh, let us, at the very mention
   of a dying Savior, bow down and adore!

   II. Not to change the topic, but to vary the line of thought, let us
   endeavor to LOOK LOVINGLY at Jesus Christ made sin for His people.

   Every word here may help our love. That word, "Him,"may remind us of
   His Person--"He has made Him to be sin for us"--Him--the Son of God,
   coequal and co-eternal with the Father! Him--the son of Mary, born at
   Bethlehem-- the spotless "Son of Man." "He has made Him to be sin." I
   am not going to enlarge. I only want to bring His blessed Person
   clearly before your mind. He who trod the waves. He who healed the sick
   He who had compassion upon the multitudes and fed them. He who always
   lives to make intercession for us--"He has made Him to be sin for us."
   Oh, love Him, Sinner, and let your heart join in the words--

   "His Person fixes all my love."

   I delight to have you get a hold of Him as being verily a Person. Do
   not think of Him as a fiction--never do so! Do not regard Him as a mere
   historical person who walked the stage of history and now is gone. He
   is very near to you right now! He is still living! We often sing--

   "Crown Him Lord of all."

   Well, this is that same Glorious One! "He has made Him to be sin for
   us." Think of Him and let your love flow out towards Him!

   Would you further excite your love? Think of His Character. He knew no
   sin--there was none within Him--for He had none of our sinful desires
   and evil propensities. "Tempted in all points like as we are, yet
   without sin." Think of that, and then read, "He has made Him to be sin
   for us." Do not fritter that away by putting in the word, "offering,"
   and saying "sin-offering." The word stands in apposition--what if I say
   opposition?--to the word, "righteousness," in the other part of the
   text. He made Him to be as much sin as He makes us to be righteousness!
   That is to say He makes Him to be sin by imputation, as He makes us to
   be righteousness by imputation! On Him who was never a sinner--who
   never could be a sinner--our sin was laid! Consider how His holy soul
   must have shrunk back from being made sin, and yet, I pray you, do not
   fritter away the words of the Prophet Isaiah, "The Lord has laid on Him
   the iniquity of us all." He bore our transgressions and carried our
   sins in His own body on the Cross. There was before the bar of Justice
   an absolute transfer made of guilt from His elect to Himself! There He
   was made sin for us, though He personally knew no sin, "that we might
   be made the righteousness of God in Him." As you think of His pure,
   immaculate Nature and perfect life--love Him as you see Him bearing the
   burden of sins not His own, for which He came to atone!

   Will not your love be excited when you think of the difficulty of this
   imputation? "He has made Him to be sin." None but God could have put
   sin upon Christ. It is well said that there is no lifting of sin from
   one person to another. There is no such thing, as far as we are
   concerned, but things which are impossible with man are possible with
   God. Do you know what it means for Christ to be made sin? You do not,
   but you can form some guess of what it involves, for when He was made
   sin, God treated Him as if He had been a sinner--which He never was and
   never could be. God left Him as He would have left a sinner, till He
   cried out, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" God smote Him as
   He would have smitten a sinner, till His Soul was "exceedingly
   sorrowful, even unto death." That which was due from His people for
   sin, or an equivalent to that, was literally exacted at the hands of
   Jesus Christ, the Son of God! He was made a debtor for our debts and He
   paid them. You may guess what it was to be a debtor for us by the smart
   which it cost to discharge our liabilities. He that is a surety shall
   smart for it--and Jesus found that proverb true. When Justice came to
   smite the sinner, it found Him in the sinner's place and smote Him
   without relenting, laying to the full the whole weight upon Him which
   had otherwise crushed all mankind forever into the lowermost Hell! Let
   us love Jesus as we think that He endured all this.

   Beloved in the Lord, there is one more string of your harp I would like
   to touch, and it is the thought of what you now are, which the text
   speaks of. You are made the righteousness of God in Christ! God sees no
   sin in you, Believer! He has put your sin, or that which was yours, to
   the account of Christ--and you are innocent before Him. Moreover, He
   sees you to be righteous. You are not perfectly righteous--the work of
   His Spirit in you is incomplete as yet--but He looks upon you, not as
   you are in yourselves, but as you are in Christ Jesus and you are
   "accepted in the Beloved." You are, in His sight, without spot, or
   wrinkle, or any such thing! What Jesus did is set to your account. He
   sees His Son in

   you and then He loves you as He loves His Son. He has put you into
   union with His Son and you are now hid with Christ in God. I trust you
   will endeavor to realize this position of yourselves as made the
   righteousness of God in Christ, and when you do, surely you will love
   the Savior who has done all this for you--undeserving, helpless, dying,
   guilty mortals! Oh, that the Lord Jesus would now send fire into all
   your souls and make you love Him, for surely, if you have but the sense
   of what He has done and how He did it, and what it cost Him to do it,
   and who He is that has done it--and who you were for whom He has done
   it--you will surely say, "Oh, for a thousand hearts that I may love You
   as I should, and a thousand tongues that I may praise You as I should!"

   III. And now, let us JOYFULLY VIEW THE GLORIOUS FACT OF SUBSTITUTION.

   And here I will commence with the observation that till your sin as a
   Believer is gone, and till, as a Believer, Christ's righteousness is at
   present your glorious dress, your salvation is in no sense realized by
   yourselves. It is not dependent upon your frames and feelings. Your
   sins are not put away through your repentance. That repentance becomes
   to you the token of the pardon of sin, but the true cleansing is found,
   not in the eyes of the penitent, but in the wounds of Jesus! Your sins
   were virtually discharged upon the accursed Cross. You stand this day
   accepted, not for anything you are, or can be, or shall be, but
   entirely and wholly through the blood and righteousness of Jesus
   Christ. We cannot state this Truth of God, it seems to me, too boldly.
   This is the very Doctrine of the Reformation--Justification by Faith,
   or rather the basis Doctrine upon which it rests. And I am persuaded
   the more plainly it is preached, the better, for it is the Gospel of
   salvation to a lost and ruined world!

   Beloved, your case is something similar to this. You are in debt and,
   according to the old laws, you must be cast into prison. You are
   brought up before the court. You cannot plead that you are not in
   debt--you are compelled to stand there and say, "Each one of these
   charges I must admit. These liabilities I have incurred and I have not
   a single penny with which to meet them." A friend in court, wealthy and
   generous, pays the debt. Now, the only reason why you go out of court
   clear, lies in the payment made by your friend. You do not leave the
   court because you never incurred the debt-- no, you didincur the debt.
   And you must admit that you did not leave the court because you pleaded
   not guilty, or because you promised never to get into debt again. Not
   so--all that would not have answered your purpose. Your creditor would
   still have cast you into prison. You did not leave the court because
   your character is excellent, or you hope to make it so. The only ground
   of your liberation from your liabilities is found in the fact that
   another person has discharged them for youand that will not be affected
   by any act you may have committed or shall commit. You may have felt
   ill today. You might have labored under 20 diseases, but those diseases
   will not imprison you, neither will they help to set you free. Your
   freedom hinges upon the fact that the debt was paid for you by another!

   Now, Christian, your hope and comfort hang here! This is the diamond
   rivet which rivets your salvation firmly! Jesus died for you--and those
   for whom Jesus died, in the sense in which we now use the language--are
   and must be saved! Unless Eternal Justice can punish two persons for
   one offense. Unless Eternal Justice can demand payment twice for the
   same debt--first from the bleeding Surety, and then from those for whom
   the Surety stood--they must be clear for whom Jesus died! This is the
   Gospel which we preach! Oh, happy they who have received it, for it is
   their joy to know it, sinners though they have been, guilty and
   ruined--and sinners though they are still--yet, since they have
   believed, Christ is theirs! Christ took their sins and paid their
   debts! And God Himself can bring no charge against the man who is
   justified by Christ! "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's
   elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ
   that died, yes, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right
   hand of God, who also makes intercession for us."

   Now, Christian, I want you to come, tonight, and enjoy this. Why, Man,
   it ought to make your soul dance for joy within you to think that sin
   is pardoned and righteousness is imputed to you/This is an unchanging
   fact, that Christ has saved you. If it was ever a fact, it is always a
   fact. If it was ever true, it is always true and always alike true--as
   true now that you are depressed, as yesterday when you were rejoicing.
   Jesus' blood does not change like your poor heart. It does not go up
   and down in value, like the markets, and fluctuate like your faith. If
   you are saved, you are saved! If you are resting in the blood, you are
   as safe, today, as you were yesterday--and you are as safe forever!
   Remember that this is true of all the saints. It is true to great
   saints, but equally so to little ones. They all stand under this
   crimson canopy and are alike protected by its blessed shadow from the
   beams of Divine Justice. It is true to you now. O Beloved, try to live
   up to it! Say, "Away, my doubts! Away, my fears! I trust a Savior slain
   and I am saved! Away, my questions! Away, my car-

   nal reasonings! I hate my sins, but I cannot doubt my Savior! It is
   true I have not lived as a Christian should live, but I will still cast
   myself into His arms." It is not faith to trust God as a saint when you
   feel you are a saint. Faith is to trust Christ as a sinner--while you
   are conscious that you are a sinner. To come to Jesus and to think
   yourselves pure, is a sorry coming to Him--but to come with all your
   impurity--this is true coming!

   I say to you, Sinner. I say to you, Saint. I say to you all this one
   thing, and I have done. When your souls are at the blackest, seek for
   nothing but the blood! When your souls are at the darkest, seek no
   light anywhere but in the Cross! Do not cling to preparations, to
   humbling, to repentings. All these things are good in their way, but
   they cannot be a balsam to a wounded conscience! Christ and Christ
   Crucified is what you need. Do not look within--look without. I say,
   when you repent, it is a base repentance that will not let you trust
   Christ, for while repentance should have one eye on sin, it should have
   the other upon the Cross. While repentance should make you lie low, yet
   it is not repentance, but unbelief, that makes you doubt the power of
   Christ to save you! Christ never came to save the righteous--He came to
   save sinners. I would have you magnify the Grace of God by believing
   that when your sin stares you most in the face, when you are most
   conscious of it and it seems to be worse than ever, Christ is the same
   to you and for you, your glorious Surety and your blessed satisfaction!
   Still believe and still trust, and do not let go your confidence that
   Christ is able to save sinners, even the chief, and will save you
   without help from your doings or your feelings! His own right arm will
   get Himself the victory and, having trod the winepress of Divine Wrath
   alone, He will save you solely by the merit of His life and of His
   death! Oh, for Grace to rest in the Savior and to know the truth of
   this text--"He has made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we
   might be made the righteousness of God in Him"!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS 5:1-10; 2 CORINTHIANS 4; 5.

   Romans 5:1-3. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
   God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith
   into this Grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of
   God. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also. Faith has such
   wondrous power that it makes us rejoice even in trial! It helps
   Christians to be glad even in the midst of sorrow.

   3. Knowing that tribulation works patience. The more trial you have,
   the more spiritual education you receive. You cannot learn the virtue
   of patience without tribulation any more than a man can learn to be a
   sailor if he stays on shore! "Tribulation works patience."

   4. And patience, experience. If you bear the trial patiently, it leaves
   the mark of its engraving tool upon your spirit, and you thus become
   fashioned into an experienced Christian.

   4. And experience, hope. What God has once done, He may do again. And
   as He has shown us so much favor, we may reasonably hope that He will
   show us some more, and that He who has given us Grace, will give us
   glory.

   5. And hope makes us not ashamed. Our hope brings us courage--no longer
   are we trembling and diffident, but we feel like children do towards a
   loving father--we are happily, restfully at home with our God. "Hope
   makes us not ashamed."

   5. Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
   Spirit which is given unto us. [See Sermons #829, Volume 14--THE
   PERFUMING OF THE HEART and #1904, Volume 32--THE PERSONAL PENTECOST AND
   THE GLORIOUS HOPE.] When Mary, the sister of Lazarus, anointed the feet
   of Jesus with the very costly ointment of

   spikenard, "the house was filled with the odor" of it--and in a similar
   fashion the love of God perfumes every part of

   our nature.

   6. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
   the ungodly."'[See Sermons #1191, Volume 20--for

   WHOM DID CHRIST DIE? and #1345, Volume 23--FOR WHOM IS THE GOSPEL
   MEANT?.]

   What a wonderful statement! "Christ died for the ungodly." Yet it was
   no slip of the pen, for the Apostle takes up his own expression and
   preaches the following little sermon upon it--

   7. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die. If a man is known to
   be sternly just, like Aristides, nobody would care enough for him to
   die for him.

   7. Yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to di. For a
   benevolent man, a true philanthropist, a lover of his race, there are
   some who might say that they would die for him. Yet the Apostle only
   says, "Perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die." It is not
   very likely, but it is possible.

   8. But God commends His love toward us, in that while we were yet
   sinners, Christ died for us. [See Sermon #104, Volume

   2--LOVE'S COMMENDATION.] Certainly we were not "good" men, we

   were not even "just" men, but we are included in this black
   description, "sinners." And "while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
   us." He died for us as sinners--He did not come to save saints, but to
   save sinners--and it was for sinners that He died.

   9. Much more, then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved
   from wrath through Him. This is a fine piece of argument and strictly
   logical. If, when we were sinners, Christ died for us, will He let us
   be condemned, now that He has washed us in His precious blood? Is it
   possible that after dying for us, He will let us fall from Grace and
   perish? That will never be! Notice the same kind of argument again--

   10. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
   death of His Son, much more, being reconciled,

   we shall be saved by His life. [See Sermon #2587, Volume 44--"MUCH
   MORE."] There is a threefold argument here. If Christ died for us when
   we were His enemies, will He not save us, now that we are His friends?
   If He died to reconcile us to God, will He not completely save us, now
   that this great work has been accomplished? And as we were reconciled
   to God by Christ's death, shall we not much more be saved by His life?
   There are three arguments and each one is sound and conclusive. The
   Believer in Jesus must be eternally saved! If Christ died for sinners,
   what will He not do for Believers, who are no longer enemies, but are
   reconciled unto God by the death of His Son?

   2 Corinthians 4:1. Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have
   received mercy, we faint not. Stern was the labor of the Apostles, but
   they felt that their work was so all-important, so Divine , that they
   must not grow weary of it, though they were, doubtless, often weary
   init.

   2. But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in
   craftiness, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully; but by
   manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's
   conscience in the sight of God. It is no part of the business of
   Christ's ministers to modify the Truth of God which He has entrusted to
   them, or to put new meanings into it which God never meant, draining
   away the very life-blood of the Gospel and leaving it dead and useless!
   But it isboth our duty and our privilege to state it just as we find it
   and to proclaim it in as plain a language as possible so that everybody
   may understand what the teaching of God really is.

   3. But if our Gospel is hid, it is hid to them that are lost. [See
   Sermon #1663, Volume 28--THE true gospel is no hidden gospel.] It was
   not hidden under fine language and oratorical flourishes on the part of
   the Apostles--there was a far more terrible barrier in the way of its
   entrance into the hearts of some who heard it.

   4-7. In whom the god of the world has blinded the mind of them which
   believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is
   the image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves,
   but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus 'sake.
   For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in
   our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
   the face of Jesus Christ But we have this treasure in earthen
   vessels.There is nothing remarkable in us. We are, in ourselves, poor,
   frail, fragile creatures, like earthen vessels of no particular value!
   Yet this we do not regret, for there is a good reason for it--

   7-10. That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. We
   are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but
   not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
   destroyed; always bearing about in the body, the dying of the Lord
   Jesus, that the life, also, of Jesus might be made manifest in our
   body. He who wishes for an easy time of it must not become a minister
   of the Gospel! If he is determined to preach it faithfully, fully,
   simply, straight from his heart, he will often find himself in such
   circumstances as the Apostle describes in these verses.

   11. For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus 'sake,
   that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal fles.
   The Apostles were always to the front where the shots were flying the
   thickest and with the deadliest aim! There they stood, the officers of
   the army of Christ--and Paul rejoiced that, for one, he was able thus
   to make himself to be nothingthat Christ might be the great All-in-All!

   12. So, then, death works in us, but life in yo . So long as Paul could
   be the means of the salvation of the souls of men, he did not mind what
   became of himself. Though it should be death to him, he would count it
   as nothing so long as it should bring life to them!

   13, 14. We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written,
   I believed and, therefore, have I spoken; we also believe and,
   therefore, speak; knowing that He which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
   raise up us, also, by Jesus, and shall present us with you. Note the
   assurance of Apostolic preaching and writing. There is no, "if," here,
   no hesitation, no doubt. The Apostles knew what they believed and knew
   why they believed it--and they spoke with conviction-- nobody was led
   into doubt by their hesitancy.

   15, 16. For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant Grace
   might through the thanksgiving ofmany redound to the glory of God. For
   which cause we faint not.Paul had said before that they did not faint,
   and now he reiterates it that though his ministry was enough to bear
   him down, and lay him prostrate in the dust, yet he did not faint.

   16, 18. But though our outward man perishes, yet the inward man is
   renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a
   moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
   while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
   are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the
   things which are not seen are eternal.

   2 Corinthians 5:1. For we know that if our earthly house of this
   tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made
   with hands, eternal in the heavens. [See Sermon #1719, Volume 29--the
   tent dissolved and the mansion

   ENTERED.] Is not this grand courage on the part of the Apostle?

   With all the world against him and he "always delivered unto death for
   Jesus' sake," he looks at the new body, the new house that God is
   making for him and he reckons that to shuffle off this mortal coil will
   be no loss to him, since when he loses the tent in which he lives,
   here, he will go to "a building of God, a house not made with hands,
   eternal in the heavens."

   2-4. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
   our house which is from Heaven: if so be that being clothed we shall
   not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle groan, being
   burdened: not for that we would be unclothed-- We are not impatient to
   enter the disembodied state--

   4-6. But clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life. Now
   He that has worked us for the same thing is God, who also has given
   unto us the earnest of the Spirit. Therefore we are always
   confident.Note the ground of the Apostle's confidence. He is quite sure
   that, inasmuch as Christ rose from the dead, so all His followers must.
   And though they die in the Lord's service, yet they shall not be losers
   thereby, but they shall the more speedily ascend to their reward! "We
   are always confident"--

   6-9. Knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from
   the Lord: (for we walk by faith, not by sight): we are confident, I
   say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present
   with the Lord. Therefore we labor, that whether present or absent, we
   may be accepted of Him. [See Sermons #413, Volume 7--to die or not to
   die! and #1303,

   Volume 22--THE BELIEVER IN THE BODY AND OUT OF THE BODY.] To be well-

   pleasing to God everywhere, in everything that we do, should be the one
   aim of a Christian, whether he is in the body or out of the body.

   10-13. For we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ; that
   everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he
   has done, whether it be good or bad, knowing, therefore, the terror of
   the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I
   trust, also, are made manifest in your consciences. For we commend not
   ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf,
   that you may have something to answer them which glory in appearance,
   and not in heart. For whether we are beside ourselves. And men said
   that these Apostles had gone out of their minds. Festus said to Paul,
   "you are beside yourself, much learning does make you mad." So Paul
   says, "Whether we are beside ourselves"--

   13. It is to God: or whether we are sober, it is for your cause. "In
   either case, we have but one objective and that is to glorify God
   through your salvation."

   14-15. For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge,
   that if One died for all, then were all dead: and that He died for all,
   that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but
   unto Him who died for them, and rose again. The life of the saved man
   must never be lived for himself! He is false to his profession if it is
   so. He must henceforth live as earnestly for God as, aforetime in his
   unregeneracy, he lived for himself, for he now has a new life which is
   not his own to do with it as he pleases, but it belongs entirely to Him
   who purchased it with His own most precious blood.

   16. Therefore, from now on, we regard no man after the flesh. Even
   though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know Him thus
   no longer. We do not see Christ with our natural eyes. We do not hear
   His voice with our natural ears. He is now to us a spiritual Person who
   communicates with our spirit through His own ever-blessed Spirit.

   17. Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
   are passed away; behold all things are become new.There could not be a
   greater change than that which is worked by regeneration! It is a new
   creation, the passing

   away of the old, and the making of all things new. [See Sermons #881,
   Volume 15--THE BELIEVER A NEW CREATURE and #1328, Volume 22-- CHRIST
   THE MAKER OF ALL THINGS NEW.]

   18-21. And all things are of God who has reconciled us to Himself by
   Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to
   wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not
   imputing their trespasses unto them; and has committed unto us the Word
   of reconciliation. Now, then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though
   God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead be you
   reconciled to God. For He made Him who knew no sin, to be sin for us,
   that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.

The Saints' Riches

   (No. 3204)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JUNE 30, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 2, 1862.

   "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how
   shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" Romans 8:32.

   MANY of you, dear Friends, are coming to the Lord's Table at the close
   of this service. Our blessed Redeemer instituted that simple but
   sublime ordinance so that we might be kept in constant remembrance of
   Him. The bread is nothing but bread, yet it is the very suggestive
   emblem of Christ's flesh. And it shall be well with you if, after a
   spiritual fashion, you shall thus eat the flesh of Christ. The wine is
   nothing but wine, yet is it the emblem of Christ's blood. And they are
   thrice blessed who experimentally understand the meaning of Christ's
   words, "Whoever eats My flesh, and drinks My blood, has eternal life."
   Christ is yours, Believer! You know that He is more yours than even
   your own life, for that you may lose. When God gave you your existence,
   He gave it to you without any covenant as to its prolongation, but He
   has given Christ to you by an Everlasting Covenant, to be yours forever
   and ever! Christ is yours, Beloved! Oh, that you knew how to make the
   best use of this blessed property! Christ is yours to live upon and to
   spend, yours to have and to hold, to keep and to enjoy, yours not only
   to look at that you may be saved, and to wear that you may be
   justified, but yours to eat that you may be refreshed by Him and live
   upon Him! Christ is yours to the fullest extent possible! There is no
   reservation--He is your absolute, indefeasible and inalienable
   property--yours, today, as perfectly as He will be when you are in
   Heaven! Yours as certainly as you are His. Oh, that you may now,
   knowing that Christ is thus your property, live upon Him, rejoice in
   Him and feel that you are, indeed, immeasurably rich!

   When we come to this Communion Table, to partake of these emblems of
   Christ's death, it will be a very happy thing for us if we remember
   that possessing Christ, we have everything. There is no need that you
   have which will not be supplied if you really know that Christ is
   yours. There is no necessity, however great, which may press upon you
   which shall not be instantaneously supplied if Christ is truly yours.
   You come to Christ's Table to meet with Christ and you know that when
   you have Him, you have everything, so you do well to sing--

   "You, O Christ, are all I need"-- for in Him you have all that you can
   possibly need. And, moreover, the gift of Christ is God's solemn pledge
   that He will keep back from you nothing that you really need. "No good
   thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly." "Whatever you
   shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive." Having given you
   Christ, He must, He will--with Christ--freely give you all things--

   "How vast the treasure we possess!

   How rich Your bounty, King of Grace!

   This world is ours and worlds to come--

   Earth is our lodge and Heaven our home.

   All things are ours--the gift of God!

   The purchase of a Savior's blood

   While the good Spirit shows us how

   To use and to improve them, too." I am going to make it my business, in
   a very simple but earnest manner, to try and exhort the children of God
   to cast aside all thoughts of their being poor and to rejoice, now, in
   their boundless riches in Christ Jesus!

   I. First, let me remind you, Believer, that, whatever you may really
   require, God will not deny it to you, for He has

   already given you Christ! THINK WHAT THIS GIFT WAS TO THE FATHER--it
   was His only-begotten and well-

   beloved Son!

   Perhaps you have a willful, wayward boy--one who costs you much, but
   brings you little comfort--yet, would you like to lose him? If you saw
   him in his coffin tomorrow, would you not cry over him as David cried
   over his son, "O my son, Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! Would God I
   had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son"? Vile he may be, and a
   disgrace to your name, yet he is still your child and you could not
   bear to give him up. But what shall I say of the child who, from his
   youth up, has been obedient to you? Who, having grown up to manhood,
   has become your friend as well as your offspring? Who has been with you
   in every holy enterprise and has proved himself to be worthy of his
   father's love and esteem? Could you give him up? Mother, you know how
   dear is your first-born son to you. Of all griefs that tear a mother's
   heart, perhaps the greatest is to lose her first-born. Even if he is
   only in his infancy, it is a wound from which the mother's tender heart
   does not soon recover. But to lose that son in manhood. To see the hale
   strong man suddenly cut down--this is no small sorrow--and many, under
   such trying circumstances, have found it no easy task to say, "The Lord
   gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."

   To lose one's child even for some object which is nearest and dearest
   to our heart, is pain and grief, indeed. Then what must it have cost
   God to give up His Son to die for His people? What must God's love to
   His only-begotten Son be? We can only speak of God after the manner of
   men, for we know not how otherwise to speak of Him and, inasmuch, as
   God is infinitely greater than we are, His love is infinitely greater
   than ours! We can only love to the finite degree of which humanity is
   capable, but God loves beyond all degree. The heart of God is filled
   with fathomless oceans of eternal affection--and this affection has
   always been fixed upon His Son! Christ is infinitely more dear to God
   than your son can ever be to you because of the greatness of the heart
   of the Father who loves His Son who has always been with Him, and ever
   His delight, who has never offended Him, who takes His share in all the
   Father's plans and who said of old, and says it always, "I delight to
   do Your will, O My God."

   Besides, Christ is One with His Father in essence. What that mysterious
   Unity is, we cannot tell. And how Christ is the Son of God, we do not
   know. We know that His Sonship does not imply any inferiority in the
   Son, nor that the Father existed before the Son. He was not the Father
   till the Son was His Son and the names, "Father," and, "Son," are not
   to be understood as they are used among us, although the marvelous,
   indescribable relationship which we cannot fully understand cannot be
   better expressed than by the terms used, "the Father" and, "the Son."
   Again I ask--what must it have cost such a Father's heart to give up
   such a Son--a Son so near and so dear to Him? Yet the Father gave up
   His Son to die for you and for me, Beloved! Theologians lay it down as
   an axiom that God cannot suffer, but I am not sure that they are right.
   I cannot understand God's love to me. I cannot rejoice as I should in
   His goodness to me unless I believe that the gift of His Son cost His
   heart awful pangs. I know that I am treading upon delicate ground and
   that I am standing where thick darkness gathers, but I am not certain
   that what theologians take for granted is necessarily true. That God
   can do everything, I do believe. And I also believe that if He wills to
   suffer He can do so. I cannot think of God as an insensible Being when
   He gave His Son to die for sinners. I cannot imagine Him giving His
   only-begotten Son and feeling no more than a heathen idol of stone
   could have done. I think that the Father, in giving up that Son who had
   always given Him such intense joy, must have suffered in His Son's
   death.

   Well then, as God has thus given up His only-begotten and well-beloved
   Son, how can He deny anything to you who believe in Him? Do you feel
   anxious about the bread that perishes? Is that worthy to be compared
   with God's only-begotten Son? Are you concerned about how you are to
   get food and clothing? How can God deny you such trifles as these when
   He has given you His Son? Perseverance in Grace--is that what you ask?
   Even that is but a crumb under the Master's table compared with His
   Son! You need certain virtues, you need help in trouble, you need
   sustenance under stern difficulties--I know not what you need, but this
   I know--all the needs of all of us put together could only make one
   little drop in comparison with the tremendous ocean of benevolence
   which flowed out of God's heart when He spared not His own Son but
   delivered Him up for us all! As we look at Christ, whom God has given
   to us, we must believe that, with Him, He will give us whatever we
   need!

   II. I shall try to knock a second time at the door of your hearts to
   comfort you by reminding you how PRECIOUS

   CHRIST WAS INTRINSICALLY IN HIMSELF.

   The wonder is not only that God gave His Son, but that His Son was what
   He was. Paul says He is "over all, God blessed forever." Jesus Himself
   said, "Before Abraham was, I Am"--claiming the very name of the eternal
   Jehovah. In due time, Christ became Man and, as Man, He was very dear
   to His Father. Even His earthly mother could not look upon her Child
   with half the affection that His Father had for Him. He was a perfect
   Man and, therefore, lovely in His Father's sight. He was, indeed,
   Himself God and, therefore, One with the Father even while He was Man.
   The loftiest angel could not adequately preach to you upon this
   point--unto what, then, shall I liken the preciousness of this gift?
   Similes fail me, metaphors I have none, "no mention shall be made of
   coral, or of pearls, for the price of Jesus is above rubies." He shall
   not be given for gold, no, not for much fine gold. As for topaz, and
   onyx, and sapphire, and all other precious stones, these must not be
   mentioned in comparison with Him. Paul's expression is the only
   appropriate one, "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift."
   Eternity alone can reveal the value of Christ! By the miseries of the
   Hell from which He saves us, let us measure Him! By the bliss of the
   Heaven to which He lifts us, let us estimate His worth! By the depths
   of ignominy and shame into which He dived, let us conceive of Him! By
   the glories He relinquished and by the agonies He bore, let us attempt
   to form some faint idea of His value! But this Pearl of Great Price is
   so precious that I am bold to say that if Heaven, and earth, and all
   the starry orbs could be sold, their united price could not buy such
   another pearl as this one which God has given to us in Christ Jesus!

   So, Beloved, as God has already given you this priceless pearl, will He
   not also give you all else that you need? If a man gave you ten
   thousand pounds, would you doubt his willingness to give you a
   farthing? If he should give you a munificent income to last throughout
   all your life, would you doubt his willingness to give you a penny if
   you were ever in need of one? I think I need not attempt to draw the
   inference--you can draw it for yourselves. See, then, the wondrous
   treasure you possess if you are a Believer in Jesus--God is yours, the
   perfect Man is yours, Christ's life, His death, His blood, His
   righteousness, His intercession, His Incarnation, His Second Advent are
   all yours--and all else that you need. Do but ask boldly, receive
   gratefully, wait patiently, hope trustfully and walk rejoicingly, for
   as God has given you His Son, shall He not, with Him, also freely give
   you all things? Sing with good old John Ryland--

   "He that has made my Heaven secure,

   Will here all good provide!

   While Christ is rich, can I be poor?

   What can I need beside?"

   III. But now, as a third blow at your unbelief, I want you to remember,
   Beloved, THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS

   GIFT WAS GIVEN.

   The text says, "He that spared not His own Son." A mother may give up
   her tall strong son to fight in the army of her country and he may
   perish by an enemy's hand. But I cannot conceive of a mother
   slaughtering her own son for her country's good! We have wondered as we
   have read of Brutus, who, when his sons had entered into a conspiracy
   against the Republic, could say, "Lictors, do your duty." The father
   saw the corpses of his sons with the pangs of a father, but with the
   stern serenity of a judge they had offended--so they must die. Strong
   must be a man's sense of justice to be able to overcome his love so as
   to give up his own son to die. But our gracious God not only gave up
   His Son to die for us, but He was Himself, (if I may use such an
   expression), the executioner of Christ. Isaiah tells us in his
   wonderful 53rd Chapter, that "The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of
   us all...It pleased the Lord to bruise Him. He has put Him to
   grief...you shall make His soul an offering for sin...We did esteem Him
   stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted." This, indeed, was the very
   sting of Christ's death, for He cried out in His worst agony, "My God,
   My God, why have You forsaken Me?" Oh, what love God must have had to
   you and to me, for it overcame His love to His only-begotten Son! So we
   read in Zechariah 13:7, "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and
   against the Man that is My Fellow, says the Lord of Hosts: smite the
   Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered." My tongue cannot tell the
   story of this marvelous Grace of God to you and to me, but I again
   remind you that although God knew that His plan of salvation involved
   His smiting His own Son and deserting Him in His hour of deepest need
   so that you and I should not perish--the Father smites, and wounds, and
   slays His own Son! And there upon the accursed tree, in intense pangs,
   unutterable, unknown, the Son of God dies, "the Just for the unjust,
   that He might bring us to God."

   Well, then, Beloved, as God has given you His Son, will He not also
   give you all else that you need? You are about to ask for fellowship
   with Christ, but that will not cost the Father the smiting of His Son,
   again, so He will surely give it to

   you! You are going to ask God for holiness, but it will give Him
   pleasure, and nothing but pleasure to make you holy! It will certainly
   not involve His lifting up His hand against His only-begotten Son
   anymore, so it shall be God's delight to give you your heart's desire!
   Having given you His Son, will He not, with Him, give you whatever you
   believingly ask of Him? He still says, "Open your mouth wide and I will
   fill it." Tell Him what your present need is and you shall have all
   that you need. Cast all your cares upon Him, for He cares for you and
   He will take all your cares away. Shame on you, Christian, if you shall
   give way to sadness--surely you will not let unbelief vex you, now! You
   know that God has given Christ for you--then can you fear that He will
   deny you anything, or leave you, at last, in trouble to sink? That is
   impossible! God forbid that you should slander Him by thinking that He
   can so act! What were you saying, poor aged Christian? "I shall want
   for bread." How can it be? How can it be? The God who out of His
   amazing love to you has smitten His only-begotten Son will certainly
   give to you whatever your soul or body may need--

   "Seek first His Kingdom's Grace to share.

   Its righteousness pursue,

   And all that needs your earthly care

   Will be bestowed on you!

   Why then despond in life's dark vale?

   Why sink to fears a prey?

   The Almighty Power can never fail,

   His love can never decay."

   IV. Now, as a fourth stroke of the axe at the root of unbelief, let me
   remind you of THE SPIRIT IN WHICH CHRIST WAS GIVEN.

   The Father gave His Son, but who asked Him to do so? Not you,
   certainly, for even after the Father had given Christ, you despised the
   wondrous gift! Who asked Him? No one of the whole human race! The
   thought never crossed any created mind. Angels did not throw themselves
   down between justice and the sinner and intercede for him. I have never
   read of any burning seraph crying to God, "Spare the guilty, Lord,
   spare the guilty! Give up Your only-begotten Son to die and let the
   guilty live!" I cannot conceive of anyone proposing to the Most High to
   make so tremendous a sacrifice. The Father did it according to His own
   Sovereign Will, unswayed by anything outside Himself. That
   self-sustained, almighty Being deigned to give this matchless
   manifestation of His inflexible Justice and His infinite Love to the
   sons of men--it was His own conception freely welling up from the deeps
   of His own loving heart! Well, Beloved, if He gave His Son unsolicited,
   will He not give you all you need, now that you have learned to ask of
   Him, now that you understand the art of the widow woman who came to the
   unjust judge and can plead with the Lord in holy importunity? Now that
   you have been taught to knock and knock again at God's door--as the man
   knocked at his friend's door until, at last, he arose at midnight to
   give him the loaves he needed--surely He will not deny you what you
   ask! As He gave you Christ unasked, unsought--when you were dead in
   sin, when you were His enemy, when you hated Him--how much more, now
   that you are His son, adopted into His family and taught by His Spirit
   to pray and to plead the promises He has given you--how much more will
   He give you all things that you need! If you have not, surely it must
   be because you ask not, or because you ask amiss. Ask now! Ask in
   faith! Ask in the name of Jesus and all your need shall be given to
   you!

   V. A fifth time let me try to smite down that old giant, Incredulity,
   by bidding you remember THE PERSONS TO WHOM THIS GIFT WAS
   GIVEN--"delivered Him up for us all.

   Not one child of God is left without that gift. Little Benjamin has as
   great a share in Christ as Reuben or Judah has. Mr. Ready-to-Halt has
   as true an interest in the blood of Jesus as Mr. Greatheart, himself,
   has. The ancient Jews, on the day they were numbered, had to each pay
   half a shekel as a ransom for their souls. The Lord said to Moses, "The
   rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less." The
   redemption money was the same for all--and Christ has paid the
   redemption money equally for all who believe in Him! Not one of those
   whom He bought with His blood is left out! Not one of His chosen, not
   one whom He calls, not one whom He justifies--all are redeemed by the
   precious blood of Christ. I know you are apt to say, "No doubt the Lord
   will give much to So-and-So, for he is an eminent saint, but not to
   me." Yet, as He gave Christ to you, why should He not give you all else
   that you need? "Oh, but I am so obscure, no one will take notice of
   me." Did not the Lord take notice of you when He gave you Christ? Then
   why should He not, with Him, freely give you all things?

   "Ah," says another, "but I have been such a backslider. Not only my
   faith, but all my other graces are so feeble, I do not feel fit to be
   numbered with the Lord's people." Ah, poor Heart, that may be true, yet
   as God has given you Christ, why should He deny you anything that you
   need? I wish I could put this Truth of God in words that would never be
   forgotten! I would like to help every heir of Heaven to carry this
   Truth with him even to his tomb! It is certain that as you believe in
   Christ, He is yours--then it must be equally certain, be you who you
   may be, that "all things are yours." Go, you lonely ones, up from the
   hour of your mourning! Take down your harps from the willows and make
   every string in them praise the name of the Lord! Come, you afflicted
   ones, wherever you wander! Come, you who think yourselves
   poverty-stricken, and find yourselves infinitely rich in Christ Jesus!
   It always delights me to know how many poor people there are, and some
   very poor ones, too, who say that this House of Prayer is the happiest
   place to which they ever go. Dearly do they love the Truth of God and
   the preacher, too, for the Truth's sake. And he often thinks with
   gratitude, when other things have failed to cheer him, that there are
   poor and needy ones who will come up to the sanctuary, seeking comfort
   and finding it, while critics, who come only to judge, will go away
   thinking there is nothing notable here. And the wise men of the world
   and the disputers will quibble at this, and carp at that, and get no
   good out of it at all. But these afflicted and poor people of God know
   the joyful sound of His Truth and they walk in the Light of His
   Countenance and find it sweet, indeed, to know that Christ is theirs
   and that all good is theirs in Christ!

   VI. Now let us turn to another argument from THE VALUE OF CHRIST TO US.

   What is the value of Christ to us? Christ is to us--I pause, for what
   shall I say? I cannot tell all that Christ is to us, for what is He not
   to us? He is the Sun of our day! He is the Star of our night! He is our
   Life! He is our life's Life! He is our Heaven on earth and He shall be
   our Heaven in Heaven! How sweetly does Madame Guyon sing of Christ and
   of His exceeding preciousness to her soul! I was reading only
   yesterday, an account that she gives of herself and of the persecutions
   she endured for Christ's sake. Yet she says that it seemed to her to be
   just the same whether she was a prisoner in the Bastille or in the gay
   society of Paris, as long as she was in communion with Christ, for
   Christ was everything to her! And the Grace-taught Christian will tell
   you that he has had his happiest times on a bed of sickness, or when
   losses and crosses have come quickly, one upon another! Fellowship with
   Christ transforms a desert into a garden, a wilderness into a paradise!
   It makes the beggar a prince and sets the prince above the angels. Give
   a man, Christ--and this is no dream I speak of, no vision of a heated
   imagination, but in sober solemn earnest do I say it--and he has
   everything that a Believer can desire! Yes, there is more in Christ
   than a Christian can hold and, like good John Welsh, the old
   Covenanter, he is ready to cry, at times, when Christ's love is very
   sweet to him, "Hold, Lord, hold! For I can bear no more! The joy of
   Your love is too great for me!" Beloved of God--not beloved of kings,
   though men grow great if they have a king's affection--not beloved of
   angels, yet it were no trifle to have a seraph's affection, but Beloved
   of Jesus, the eternal Son of God! To have our names written on His
   heart and engraved on His hands, oh, how exceedingly precious is Christ
   to us!--

   "Precious in His death victorious,

   He the host of Hell overthrows!

   In His Resurrection glorious,

   Victor crowned over all His foes!

   Precious, Lord! Beyond expressing,

   Are Your beauties all Divine!

   Glory, honor, power and blessing

   Be henceforth forever Thine." Well then, I hope you never set your food
   and raiment in comparison with Christ. He who gave you His unspeakable
   gift will give you such trifles as those! I hope you never put your
   worldly estate, nor even your spiritual comforts, in comparison with
   your blessed Lord Jesus, for as God has given you Him, what can He deny
   you? Pluck up your heart, poor fainting one! Be of good courage and
   face the foe again! You have no armor for your back, so show your
   breastplate to your adversary and never even dream of defeat. He who
   has brought you thus far and enriched you with such a priceless Gift
   can deny you nothing that you really need!

   VII. And, lastly, remember THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH GOD GAVE HIS SON,
   JESUS CHRIST, FOR US.

   His purpose was our salvation and it is inconsistent with all right
   ideas of Deity to believe that the purposes of God can be frustrated.
   We know that our God made the heavens and the earth and that the Word
   of our God shall stand forever. Our God is not a lackey to the will of
   men and His purposes are not like footballs to be kicked about as men
   may please. What God says, is done! What He commands, stands fast
   forever! And what His heart devises, that His hands do. "God is not a
   man that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He should change."
   And if He wills to save, none can damn. He has proved the honesty and
   sincerity of His purpose to save us by giving us Christ. And if my
   faith has laid hold of Christ, and Christ is mine, then I know that it
   is God's purpose to save me! And I also know that all things that are
   necessary to my being saved must surely be bestowed upon me. I have
   never yet been able to put my mind into such a condition as to
   understand that God would give Christ to die with the intention of
   saving a man--and yet that man would not be saved!

   I know that you and I, in ordinary business transactions, are
   accustomed to expect, if we pay the price for anything, that we should
   have what we buy. I am sure that I could not speculate with another
   man's blood--and especially I know that I could make no speculation
   with the blood of my own son! I must know beforehand what so great a
   sacrifice would effect. In like manner, we believe that God well knew
   what Christ's blood would buy, and what Christ's death would
   ef-fect--and we cannot think that Calvary was a venture, that the Cross
   was a speculation--and that the death of Christ was a lottery. God
   forbid! Be of good courage, then, you who are redeemed--not with
   corruptible things such as silver and gold, but with the precious blood
   of Christ--all things must be yours! How can He who has already given
   Christ to be the Way to Heaven, leave you without shoes for your feet,
   or without armor for the fight, or without anything else that you will
   need? He who has given the greater must and will give the less! Lay
   your many needs before Him. Your plea is a plea that must prevail, a
   knock that shall make Heaven's gates ring till the porter shall open
   them--and the favor that you need shall be given with open hands!

   The only question I have to ask before I have done is this--Is Christ
   yours Is Christ yours, my Hearer? Answer "Yes," or "No," tonight! He is
   yours, or He is not yours, there is no third answer! Is Christ yours?
   Do you say "No"? Alas, poor wretch, how miserable is your state
   now!--"condemned already." How wretched shall your state be hereafter,
   when, "Depart, you cursed," shall be your sentence! "I know not," says
   one, "whether Christ is mine or not." Do you trust Him? This is the
   deciding question. If you fully and implicitly trust yourself with
   Christ, He is yours! If you rest in any degree upon your own works,
   feelings, doings, or willings, He is not yours! But if you take Him now
   to be your All-in-All, trusting Him and Him, alone, He is yours and He
   shall be yours forever and ever! Let there be no aching heart at this
   Communion Table tonight! Let everyone of us come to this feast of love
   with joy and gladness because when we can say that Christ is ours we--

   "Can smile at Satan's rage, And face a frowning world."

   May the Lord give Christ to each one of us and unto Him shall be the
   glory world without end! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS8:26-39.

   Verse 26. Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities. Oh, how many
   these are! Lack of memory, lack of faith, lack of earnestness,
   ignorance, pride, deadness, coldness of heart--these are some of our
   infirmities. But thank God we have the Omnipotent Spirit of God to help
   us!

   26. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit
   itself makes intercession for us with groans which cannot be uttered.
   These groans are too deep, too full of meaning to be expressed in
   words. There are some things the Christian needs for which he cannot
   ask. Perhaps he does not even know what it is that he needs. There is a
   vacuum in his heart, but he does not know what would fill it. There is
   a hunger in his spirit, but he knows not what the bread is, nor where
   the bread is that can satisfy his needs. But the Holy Spirit can
   articulate these unuttered groans and the deepest needs of our soul can
   thus be brought before God by His own Spirit. You, then, who find it
   difficult to pray, do not give up praying! The devil tells you that
   such poor prayers as yours are can never reach the ear of God. Do not
   believe him! The Spirit helps your infirmities--and when He helps you,
   you shall, you mustprevail!

   27. And He that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the
   Spirit, because He makes intercession for the

   saints according to the will of God. [See Sermon #1532, Volume 26--THE
   HOLY SPIRIT'S INTERCESSION.] It cannot be supposed that the Father does
   not know what is the mind of the Spirit, since they are one God, and,
   moreover, inasmuch as the Spirit of God never intercedes for anything
   which is not according to God's will, we are sure that our heavenly
   Father will grant every Spirit-indited prayer!

   28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that
   love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose." [See
   Sermon #159, Volume 3--THE TRUE CHRISTIAN'S BLESSEDNESS.] Almost
   everything in this world looks to us to be in confusion, but to God's
   eyes, all is in order. One wave dashes this way and another that, but
   they are all working together, and they are all working with one great
   purpose, too. Say not, Christian, "All these things are against me."
   Ah, poor Soul! This is the verdict of your unbelief, but you will know
   better than that one of these days! All things are working for you, and
   not one of them is working against you--therefore, be not dismayed.
   They are all working together for good to those who love God, to those
   who are the called according to His purpose.

   29. For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed
   to the image of His Son, that He might be

   the first-born among many brethren. [See Sermons #355, Volume
   7--PORTRAITS OF CHRIST and #1043, Volume 18--GLORIOUS PREDESTINATION.]
   That was the very end and object of their predestination that they
   might become like Christ, their great perfect elder Brother--

   "'Christ, be My first Elect,' He said,

   Then chose our souls in Christ our Head

   Before He gave the mountains birth

   Or laid foundations for the earth!"

   30. Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also called [See Sermon
   #241, Volume 5--predestination and calling.] My Soul, have you been
   called of God? Has the Spirit of God

   ever called you? If so, rejoice in your predestination! Have no doubts
   and fears concerning that matter, for He would never have called you if
   He had not intended to save you from before the foundation of the
   world!

   30. And whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified,
   them He also glorified. My Soul, do you believe in Jesus?

   Have you trusted in His precious blood? Then you are justified! Never
   give way, then, to any fears concerning your eternal salvation, for as
   surely as there is a Heaven, you shall be a partaker of its
   glories--for never was there a soul justified who was not afterwards
   glorified!

   31. What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can
   be against uss'[See Sermon #580, Volume 10--god is with

   US.] Have you the world against you, Christian? What is the

   opposition of the world when God is on your side? Is your own heart
   against you? What then? God is greater than your heart! Is the devil
   against you? Ah, he is mighty, but God is Almighty and He shall bruise
   Satan under your feet shortly. Paul was no fanatic--he was a man of
   great experience and of sound sense--yet he makes nothing of all our
   foes when God is on our side!

   32. He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,
   how shall He not, with Him, also freely give us all things?When God
   gave us Christ, He gave us everything, for all the blessings of this
   life and of the life that is to come lie hidden in Christ as the kernel
   is within the shell of the nut! What encouragement we have here for
   believing prayer! Christian, Christ is the golden key of God's
   treasuries! You have but to use Him aright, and whatever you need shall
   be yours!

   33. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?Here is true
   boldness! Paul, who called himself the very chief of sinners dares to
   challenge anyone to lay anything to the charge of God's elect! Surely
   God can do so. "No," says

   Paul--

   33. It is God that justifies. He is both Just and the Justifier of all
   who believe in Jesus, and they are "God's elect."

   34. Who is He that condemns [See Sermons #256, Volume 5--THE BELIEVER'S
   CHALLENGE and #2240, Volume 38--A CHALLENGE AND A

   SHIELD.] "Why," says one, "Christ, the great Judge, will condemn." No,
   that He will not, for--

   34. It is Christ that died, yes, rather, that is risen again, who is
   even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.
   Christian, as Christ makes intercession for you, He will never condemn
   you! Did He shed His blood for you and yet will He cast you into Hell?
   Did He rise from the dead for you, and yet will He leave you among the
   dead and the lost? Think not so strangely of the Christ of God who is
   the same yesterday, and today, and forever--and who will never condemn
   those who trust in Him!

   35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation,
   or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
   sword? They have been tried again and again.

   36. It is written, For Your sake we are killed all day long; we are
   accounted as sheep for the slaughter. What was the effect of this
   persecution? Were the saints turned away from Christ by it?

   37-39. No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him
   that loved us. For I am persuaded that

   neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
   nor things present, nor things to come, nor height nor

   depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the
   love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord [See Sermon #2492,
   Volume 45--PAUL'S PERSUASION.]

Scales Taken From the Eyes

   (No. 3205)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 7, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales." Acts
   11:18.

   THIS means that the film upon Saul's eyes was comparable to the scales
   of a fish, or else that it fell off as scales might fall. When the
   blinding film was gone, light broke into the darkness of Saul. In
   different men, sin manifests its chief power in different parts of
   their nature. In the case of many, sin is most apparent in their eyes.
   That is to say, ignorance, error and prejudice have injured their
   mental sight. Some have the withered hand of conscious inability,
   others have the deaf ear of mental obtuseness, but there are far more
   who hear the joyful sound and display much energy, but they hear
   without understanding and are zealous without knowledge, for they are
   blind. This was Saul's condition. He was thoroughly honest--we might
   say of his heart, when it was at its worst, that it was always true to
   its convictions. He was no deceiver and no timeserver. He went in for
   what he believed to be right with all his might--lukewarmness and
   selfish policy were alien to his nature. He dashed with all his might
   against the Doctrine of the Cross because he thought it to be an
   imposition. His fault lay in his eyes and so, when the eyes were set
   right, Saul was right. When he perceived that Jesus was, after all, the
   Messiah, the man became just as earnest a follower of Christ as before
   he had been a persecutor!

   We will talk about scales falling from men's eyes. I want to address
   those who would be right if they knew how. Those who are earnest, but
   in the wrong direction, for they do not see the truth. If the Lord, in
   His Infinite Mercy, will but touch those sightless eyeballs and remove
   the film, so that they discern the right way, they will follow it at
   once. May the Lord remove many scales while we are proceeding!

   First, we will speak of scales which men fail to perceive because they
   are inside. Secondly, we will show what makes these scales come to the
   outside so that men do perceive them. Then, thirdly, what
   instrumentality the Lord uses to take these outside scales away And,
   fourthly, what did Saul see when the scales were gone

   I. First, then, THERE ARE SCALES WHICH MEN DO NOT PERCEIVE. Saul had
   scales upon his eyes when he was on the road to Damascus, but if you
   had looked at his face, he would have appeared to have as bright an eye
   as any man. Scales on his eyes? Why, he was a sharp-sighted
   philosopher, a Pharisee and a teacher of others. He would not have
   believed you for a minute if you had said to him, "Saul, you are
   blind." Yet blind he was, for his eyes were shut up with inside
   scales--the worst sort of scales that can possibly cloud the sight.

   Saul had the scale of selfto darken his eyes. He had a great idea of
   Saul of Tarsus. If he had written down his own character, he would have
   begun it, "A Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the Law of God, a
   Pharisee." And then he would have gone on to tell of countless good
   works, fasts, prayers and have finished with, "concerning zeal,
   persecuting the church." He was far too great in his own estimation to
   become a disciple of Jesus Christ! How could the Rabbi who sat at the
   feet of Gamaliel become a follower of the despised Galilean? Poor
   peasants might follow the Man of Nazareth, but Doctor Saul of Tarsus--a
   man so educated both in the knowledge of the Hebrew literature and of
   the Greek philosophy--it was not likely that he would mingle with
   fishermen and peasants in adoring the Nazarene! This is the reason why
   a great many people cannot see the beauties of Christ and cannot come
   to Him that they might have life, namely, because they are so great in
   their own esteem! Ah, my lord, it might have been a good thing for you
   if you had been a pauper! Ah, good Moralist, it might not be amiss for
   you if you would sit by the side of those who have lost character among
   men and discover that after all, there are not many shades of
   difference between you and them! Great "I" must fall before the great
   Savior will be seen! When a man becomes nothing in his own estimation,
   then Jesus Christ becomes everything to him, but not till then. Self is
   an effectual darkener of the windows of the soul. How can men see the
   Gospel

   while they see so much of themselves? With such a noble righteousness
   of their own to deck themselves with, is it likely that they will buy
   of Christ the fine white linen which is the righteousness of saints?

   Another scale on Saul's inner eye was ignorance, and learned ignorance,
   too, which is by far the worst kind of ignorance! Saul knew everything
   but what he ought to have known. He was instructed in all other sorts
   of learning, but he did not know Christ. He had never studied the
   Lord's claim and Character--he had picked up the popular rumors and he
   had thought them to be sterling truth. Ah, had he known, poor Soul,
   that Jesus of Nazareth really was the Christ, he would never have
   hauled men and women to prison! But the scale of ignorance was over his
   eyes. And how many there are in this city of London, in what we call
   this "enlightened" 19th Century, who know a great deal about a thousand
   things, but nothing about the one thing necessary! They have never
   troubled to study Christ and so, for lack of knowledge, they grope
   about as the blind!

   With ignorance generally goes another scale, namely, prejudice. The man
   who knows nothing about truth is usually the man who despises it most.
   He does not know and does not want to know. "Don't tell me," he says,
   "don't tell me." He has nothing but a sneer for you when you have told
   him the Truth of God to the best of your ability. The man has no
   candor. He has made up his mind, he has! Besides, his father before him
   was not of your religion and do you think he is going to be a turncoat
   and leave the old family faith? "Don't tell me," he says, "I don't want
   to know anything of your canting Methodism," or, "Presbyterianism," or
   whatever it is that he likes to call it. He is so wise! He is wiser
   than seven men that can render a reason! O Prejudice, Prejudice,
   Prejudice, how many have you destroyed! Men who might have been wise
   have remained fools because they thought they were wise. Many judge
   what the Gospel ought to be, but do not actually enquire as to what it
   is. They do not come to the Bible to obtain their views of religion,
   but they open that Book to find texts to suit the opinions which they
   bring to it. They are not open to the honest force of the Truth of God
   and, therefore, are not saved by it! Oh, that this scale would fall
   from every eye which it now closes!

   Saul's soul was also darkened by the scale of unbelief Saul had seen
   Stephen die. If he saw the martyr's heavenly face, he must have noticed
   the wondrous peace which sat upon his countenance when he fell asleep
   amid a shower of stones. But Saul did not believe. Though no sermon is
   like the sight of a martyrdom, yet Saul was not convinced. Perhaps he
   had heard about the Savior more than he cared to remember, but he did
   not believe it. He counted the things rumored concerning Him to be idle
   tales and cast them under his feet. O Brothers and Sisters, what
   multitudes are being ruined by this cruel unbelief towards Christ! Some
   of you, too, whom I have been addressing for years, are Believers in
   the head, but unbelievers in the heart, not really putting your trust
   in Jesus! Who can see if he refuses the Light of God? Who shall find
   salvation if he will not trust the Savior for it? Unbelief is as sure
   to destroy those who are guilty of it as faith is sure to save
   Believers!

   Then the scale of habit, too, had formed over Saul's inner eyes, for he
   had been for a long time what he then was. "Can the Ethiopian change
   his skin, or the leopard his spots?" If so, then he that is accustomed
   to do evil may learn to do well. They say that use is second nature and
   when the first nature is bad, the second nature is like the first, only
   it goes further in wrong. Ah, dear Friends, some of you have been so
   accustomed to refuse the Gospel, so accustomed to follow after the
   pleasures and the vices of the world, that it does not seem possible
   that you should follow after Christ! Habits of secret sin are
   peculiarly blinding to the soul. May this scale be speedily made to
   fall!

   Another scale is worldliness, and Saul had that upon his inner eyes,
   for he loved the praise of men. He had his reputation to maintain, for
   he had profited beyond most of his brothers and was reckoned to be a
   most hopeful and rising teacher of Israel. It was not likely that Saul
   would believe in Jesus Christ, for then he would have to lose the
   esteem of his countrymen. The fear of man and the love of man's
   applause--how they prevent men from seeing the Truth about Jesus and
   recognizing Him as the Son of God! "How can you believe, which receive
   honor, one of another?" How can men bow themselves before Jesus Christ
   when, all the while, they are bidding high for the homage of their
   fellow sinners? The love of adulation, which is a form of worldliness,
   blinds the eyes and so will any other love of things beneath the moon!
   Let but the heart be set upon this blinding world and there will be
   little sight for things Divine.

   II. These scales were upon the inside of Saul's eyes when he was on the
   way to Damascus, but now we have to notice them BROUGHT TO THE OUTSIDE.
   Those outside scales revealed in type and figure what had always been
   the matter with Saul--they were the material index of the spiritual
   mischief under which he had long labored! Only now they were brought
   outside so that he knew they were there, and others could perceive that
   they were there. Now there was hope

   that they would be removed from the eyes! Now that he was conscious of
   them, the evil was half cured! What brought those scales to the outside
   and made Saul know that he was blind?

   Well, first, it was the exceeding Glory of Christ. He says, "About
   noon, suddenly there shone from Heaven a great light round about me,"
   and he adds, "I could not see for the Glory of that light." Let my Lord
   Jesus Christ only manifest Himself to any of you and you will be well
   enough aware of your blindness and you will say to yourselves, "What a
   strangely blind being I must have been not to have loved such beauty as
   this--not to have yielded myself to such Grace as this--not to have
   trusted myself to so complete a Savior as this!" Oh, the Glory of
   Christ! It has even laid the saints prostrate when they have seen it!
   Those who dwell nearest to their Lord are frequently overcome with the
   exceeding brightness of His Glory and have to confess with those
   favored three--

   "When in ecstasy sublime, Tabor's glorious steep we climb, At the
   too-transporting light, Darkness rushes over our sight." So it is with
   the sinner when he gets his first view of a glorious Christ--the inrush
   of the Glory makes him mourn his native blindness--he perceives that he
   has had no perception and knows that he has known nothing!

   Another thing which made the scales pass to the outside of Saul's eyes
   was that unanswerable question, "Why do you persecute Me?" That brought
   home to him a sense of his sin. "Why?" That was a "why" for which Saul
   of Tarsus could not find a, "because." When he discovered that the Man
   of Nazareth was the glorious Christ of God, then, indeed, he was
   "confounded." He could make no reply to the demand, "Why do you
   persecute Me?" Oh, that the Lord would fix such a "why" in some of your
   hearts! Why should you live in sin? Why are you choosing the wages of
   unrighteousness? Why are you hardening your hearts against the Gospel?
   Why are you ridiculing it? Why do you sneer at the servants of God? If
   the Holy Spirit drives that "why" home to your heart, you will begin to
   say, "What a blind fool I am to have acted as I have done, to go
   kicking against the pricks, fighting against my best Friend and pouring
   scorn on those whom I ought most of all to admire!" The whyfrom the
   lips of Christ will show you your blindness!

   The scales were on the outside of Saul's eyes, now, because his soul
   had been cast into a terrible bewilderment. We read of him that when
   his eyes were opened, he saw no man, but trembling and astonished, he
   asked the Lord what he must do. Some of us know what that experience
   means. We have been brought under the hand of God till we have been
   utterly astonished--astonished at our Savior, astonished at our sin,
   astonished that there should be a hope remaining for us, astonished
   that we should have rejected that hope so long! With this amazement,
   there was mixed trembling lest, after all, the mercy should be too
   great for us and the next word from the Lord would be, "You have kicked
   against the pricks so long that, henceforth, the gates of mercy are
   shut against you." May the Lord fill some of you with trembling and
   astonishment! And if He does, then you will perceive the blindness of
   your soul--and cry for light!

   I have no doubt the scales became all the more perceptible to poor Saul
   when he came to those three days and nights of prayer, for when you get
   a man on his knees and he begins crying for mercy, he is in the way of
   being more fully taught his need of it! If relief does not come at
   once, then the penitent cries more and more intensely--his heart all
   the while is aching more and more and he perceives how blind he must
   have been to bring himself into such a condition. It is a good thing,
   sometimes, when the Lord keeps a man in prayer, pleading for the mercy
   and pleading, and pleading, and pleading on and on, until he perceives
   how great his need of that mercy is! When he has bitterly felt the
   darkness of his soul, he will be exceedingly bold in bearing light to
   his fellow men. May God bring many of you to agonizing prayer! And if
   that prayer should last days and nights and you should neither eat nor
   drink for anguish of spirit, I guarantee you that you will thoroughly
   learn your blindness and the scales upon your eyes will be painfully
   evident to you!

   III. Now thirdly, and here I should like to stir up the people of God
   to a little practical business--we have seen Saul with the scales
   outside his eyes. He now knows that he is blind, though he did not know
   it before when he was a proud Pharisee. He can see a great deal better,
   now, than he could when he thought he could see. But still, there he
   is, in dark-

   ness--and we long for the scales to be removed! WHAT INSTRUMENTALITY
   DID THE LORD USE TO TAKE THE

   SCALES AWAY?

   It was not an angel, nor was it an Apostle, but it was a plain mannamed
   Ananias, who was the means of bringing sight to blind Saul! We do not
   know much about this useful Brother. We know his name and that is
   enough. But Ananias

   was the only person whom the Lord used in taking off the scales from
   this Apostle's eyes. Dear Brothers and Sisters, there are some of you,
   if you are but alive to it, whom God will bless in like work! Perhaps
   this very night, though you are unknown and obscure Christian people,
   He may make you to be the means of taking the scales from the eyes of
   somebody who will be eminently useful in future years. The Holy Spirit
   blessed the great Apostle to the Gentiles by Ananias and He may lead
   another of His mighties to Himself by some obscure disciple!

   Ananias was a plain man, but he was a good man--you can see that
   Ananias was a thorough man of God. He was one who knew his Lord and
   recognized His voice when He said to him, in a vision, "Ananias." And
   he was a man whom the Lord knew, for He called him by his name. "I have
   called you by your name: you are Mine." The Lord will not send you on
   His errands unless you are sound, sincere and living near to Him. But
   if you are that, no matter how feeble you may be, I beseech you to be
   looking, even tonight, for some blind soul to whom you may be as eyes!

   Notice that this Ananias was a ready man, for when the Lord spoke to
   him, he said, "Behold, I am here, Lord." I know many professors who
   would have to answer, "Behold, I am somewhere else, Lord, but certainly
   not here." They are not "all there" when they are in Christ's work! The
   heart is away after something else. But, "Behold, I am here, Lord," is
   a grand thing for a Believer to say when his Lord bids him seek the
   wanderer. It is well to say, "Behold, I am here, Lord, ready for the
   poor awakened one. If he needs a word of comfort, I am ready to say it
   to him. If he needs a word of direction, here am I, as You shall help
   me to speak it to him." My Brother, be you like Ananias was, a ready
   man!

   And he was an understanding man, for when the Lord said to him
   concerning Saul, "Behold; he prays," he knew what that meant. He well
   understood the first indication of Grace in the soul! Beloved, you must
   have a personal experience of the things of God, or you cannot help
   newborn souls! If you do not know what it is to pass from death to
   life, and do not know the marks of regeneration, you are useless.

   At the same time, he was a discerning man--an enquiring, discriminating
   man, for he began to say, "Lord, I have heard by many of this man." He
   wanted to know a little about Saul, so he enquired of the great Master
   as to his character, and whether it was a genuine work of Grace in his
   soul. It will not do to pat all people on the back and give them
   comfort without examining into their state. Some of you must know by
   this time that indiscriminate consolation does more hurt than good.
   Certain classes need no consolation, but rather require reproof. They
   need wounding before they can be healed! And it is a good thing to know
   your man, and especially to wait upon the Lord and ask Him to tell you
   about your man, so that you may know how to deal with him when you do
   come to him. As Ananias did, use all diligence to know the case.

   But when once he had made his enquiry, he was an obedient man. He was
   told to go into a house where I do not suppose he had ever left his
   card in his life, but he did not stop for an introduction--he went off
   at once to the house of Judas, and enquired for one called Saul, of
   Tarsus. He had Divine authority--the Lord had given him a
   search-warrant, and so he entered the house--

   "Thus the eternal mandate ran, Almighty Grace, arrest that man!"

   Ananias must be the sheriffs officer to go and arrest Saul in the name
   of the Lord! And so away he went.

   And you will notice what a personal-dealing man he was, for he did not
   stand at a distance, but, putting his hands on him, he said, "Brother
   Saul" Ah, that is the way to talk to people who are seeking the
   Lord--not to stand five miles off, and speak distantly, or preach
   condescendingly, as from the supreme Heaven of a sanctified Believer,
   down to the poor sinner mourning below! No, go and talk to him! Call
   him, "Brother." Go and speak to him with a true, loving, brotherly
   accent, as Ananias did, for he was a brotherly man.

   Ananias was also a man whose subject was Christ. As soon as ever you do
   speak to the sinner, let the first thing you have to say be, "The Lord,
   even Jesus." Whatever you say next, begin with that, "Brother Saul, the
   Lord, even Jesus." Have something to say about Jesus, but say it
   personally and pointedly, not as though you were alluding to persons
   living in Australia seven hundred years ago, but as referring to
   Brother Saul, and intending the word for him!

   Among Christian people there are mighty hunters before the Lord who
   strive after souls, but I wish that a hundred times as many really
   cared for the souls of their fellow men. Some church members never
   speak to anybody about spiritual things. You come into your pews and
   you like two seats if you can get them--like gentlemen in a first-class
   carriage, you want a compartment to yourselves! And then, after
   service, no matter who is impressed, many of you have not a word

   to say. Should it be so, Brothers and Sisters? We should always be on
   the lookout to seat strangers comfortably and afterwards to drive home,
   by personal remark, any Truth of God which may have been advanced. "Ah,
   says one, but I may speak to the wrong person." Suppose you did? Is it
   such a mighty misfortune to miss your mark once? Ah, Brothers and
   Sisters, if you were to address the wrong person 50 times and
   ultimately meet the right one once in a year, it would well reward you!
   If you were to receive rebuffs, and rebuffs, and rebuffs, and yet at
   last you should find out the Brother Saul who is to have the scales
   removed by you--and by none but you--you would be well rewarded! A
   plain common-sense word from a common-sense Christian has often been
   the very thing to set some able critic at liberty! Some man of profound
   mind--a Thomas of abundant doubts and questions--has only just needed a
   simple-hearted Christian to say the right words and he has entered into
   peace and liberty. You must not think that learned persons, when the
   Lord touches them in the heart, need to be talked to by Doctors of
   Divinity. Not they! They become as simple-hearted as others and, like
   dying kings and dying bishops, they ask to hear a shepherd pray because
   they find more savor, more plainness, more earnestness, more faith and
   more familiarity with God in the humble expressions of the lowly than
   in the language of courtly preachers. Do not, therefore, Brother
   Ananias, say, "I cannot go and talk to anybody. I have never been to
   college." Do not, Sister in Christ, stay back because you are a woman,
   for oftentimes the Lord makes the sweet and gentle voice of women to
   sound out the music of Grace! God grant that many of us may be the
   instruments of taking the scales from men's eyes!

   IV. LASTLY, WHAT DID SAUL SEE WHEN THE SCALES WERE GONE?

   The first person he saw was Brother Ananias. It was a fine sight for
   Saul to see Brother Ananias' Christian countenance beaming with love
   and joy! I fancy he was like one of our elders, a fine old Christian
   man with love to souls written on his face. When Saul opened his eyes,
   it must have done him good to see just such a face as that--a plain,
   simple man full of holy zeal and intense anxiety for his good. Dear
   Friend, if the Lord opens your eyes, you will see the brotherhood of
   Christians. Perhaps you will enjoy that among the first delights of
   your Christian experience and, for a little while, your faith, it may
   be, will hang upon the testimony of an instructed Christian woman and
   your confidence will need confirmation by the witness of a more
   advanced Brother in the Lord. But, my fellow worker, the saved one will
   never see Brother Ananias unless Ananias goes to him and becomes the
   means of opening his eyes! And if you will go and do that, you will win
   a friend who will love you as long as life lasts. There are some of you
   between whom and myself there are ties which death cannot snap. I will
   find you in Heaven if I can and I know you will desire to meet me. The
   Lord gave you to me as my spiritual children and if it should come to
   pass that earthly fathers should not see their children in Heaven, yet
   the spiritual father will see his children there praising and blessing
   the Lord! One of the next joys to knowing Christ, yourself, must surely
   be that of leading others to know Him. Seek after this bliss!

   The next thing that Saul would see would be a Savior in Christ, for
   Ananias said to him, "The Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto you in
   the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight."
   Now he would see what an opener of the eyes Jesus is, what a mighty
   Savior for sinners! And, oh, this is a blessed sight--to see Christ as
   a Savior, as my Savior, opening my eyes, so that I can say, "One thing
   I know, whereas I was blind, now I see." This is a heavenly sight. May
   you help many to gaze upon it!

   Right speedily he saw the Spirit of God waiting to fill him--"that you
   might receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." Ah, dear
   Soul, when you have come to see Christ, then the blessed Spirit will
   become dear to you and you will rejoice to think that He will dwell in
   you to sanctify you, to enlighten you, to strengthen you, and to make
   you a vessel of mercy unto others!

   One more thing that Saul saw, when his eyes were opened, was what some
   do not see, although their eyes are opened in other aspects. "He
   received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized." He saw the duty
   of Believers' Baptism and he attended to it directly. You who believe
   in Jesus should confess Jesus. And you who have confessed Jesus should
   gently stir the memories of those very retiring young converts who are
   afraid to put on Christ in Baptism. You know right well that salvation
   lies in the believing, but still, how amazingly the two things are put
   together, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." The two
   things are joined together by Christ, so let no man put them asunder!
   Surely, dear Friends, wherever there is a genuine faith in Christ,
   there ought to be a speedy obedience to the other matter! I once met a
   man who had been a Christian 40 years and believed it to be his duty to
   be baptized. But when I spoke to him about it, he said, "He that
   believes shall not make haste." After 40 years delay, he talked about
   not making haste! I quoted to him another passage--"I made haste, and
   delayed not to keep Your commandment," and showed him what the meaning
   of his misapplied passage was. Now, Soul, do not delay! As soon as
   Saul's eyes were opened, straightway he took upon himself the outward
   badge of the Christian faith and arose, and was baptized! Now I call
   upon you who love the Lord Jesus Christ not to play the coward, but
   come out and acknowledge your Lord and Master! You that are truly His
   disciples, confess it! I like to see a soldier wearing his red coat--it
   is the right thing for him to wear his uniform. It is the same with the
   soldiers of Christ. What are you ashamed of? Be ashamed of being
   ashamed, if you are ashamed of Christ! "Oh, but, I am afraid I might
   not hold on my way!" Whose business is it to make you hold on your way?
   Is it not His business who has bid you to take up your cross and follow
   Him, and who has said, "Whoever shall confess Me before men, him will I
   confess before My Father which is in Heaven; but whoever shall deny Me
   before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in Heaven"?

   I pray the Lord to bless these feeble words of mine. O Souls, O Souls,
   it does seem to me so dreadful that so many of you should come here
   continually and yet be blind! I try to talk plainly about your souls'
   needs and about Christ Jesus as able to meet those needs--how long must
   I repeat the old story? Once again I beseech you, think upon my Lord
   and Master and see what a Savior He is, and how suitable He is for you!
   I would entreat you to delay no longer, but to close in with the
   invitations of His mercy. I think, sometimes, that my Master deserves
   that we should do more than invite you. We commandyou, in the name of
   Jesus of Nazareth, to bow before His scepter, for He is the King!
   Acknowledge His dominion and let Him be your Savior, for know this--His
   Gospel comes with Divine Authority as well as with gentle
   persuasion--and neither can men reject it except at the peril of their
   souls! He whom I preach to you tonight will shortly come to be your
   Judge. And if you will not trust Him on His Cross, you must tremble
   before Him on His Throne! Oh, come to Him! Simple trust is the way to
   come to Him. Believe in Him and He is yours and His salvation is yours!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ACTS 9:1-22; 22:1-16.

   Acts 9:1, 2. And Saul, yet breathing out threats and slaughter against
   the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and desired of him
   letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this
   Way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to
   Jerusalem. His very breath was hot with malice against the saints! He
   could not live without venting his spite upon the disciples of Christ.
   He showed this by the fact that he not only sought to arrest men, but
   he was equally cruel towards women, who, from their weakness, one would
   have thought might have been left alone--but he expressly desired it to
   be written in the letters that, "whether they were men or women, he
   might bring them bound to Jerusalem."

   3. And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
   shined round about him a light from Heaven. When speaking before
   Agrippa, Paul said that it was "a light from Heaven above the
   brightness of the sun." Was it not that very Shekinah which of old had
   shone forth between the cherubim over the Mercy Seat?

   4, 5. And he fell to the earth, and heard a Voice saying to him, Saul,
   Saul, why do you persecute Me? And he said, Who are You, Lord? And the
   Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick
   against the pricks. There is something very characteristic about
   Christ's answer to Saul's question. He did not say, "It is hard for
   Me," although He was, Himself, persecuted in His members and felt
   intense sympathy with them. He did not dwell upon that, but He said to
   Saul, "It is hard for you." There was much pity in the rebuke. Saul was
   like a bull that has been pricked by the sharp ox-goad and kicks
   against it--and so is hurt all the more. Our Lord knew what sorrow it
   would cause Saul in the years to come, for he would never cease to
   lament that he had persecuted the disciples of Christ.

   6. And he, trembling and astonished. Finding that Jesus, whom he
   thought to be dead and buried, and those followers he was so violently
   opposing, was yet alive--

   6-8. Said, Lord, what will You have me to do? And the Lord said to him,
   Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.
   And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice,
   but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were
   opened, he saw no men: but they led him by the hand, and brought him
   into Damascus. So the proud persecutor, who was going to Damascus as a
   conqueror to crush the saints of God was, himself, led into the city as
   a captive, to be forever afterwards the slave of Jesus Christ!

   9. And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink
   What passed through that mind which was darkened to natural light, but
   was being filled with spiritual light, we can well guess. I mean, those
   of us who have experienced true conviction of sin. In those three days,
   he lived his life of opposition to the Lord Jesus over again--what
   heart-break he must have felt and what anguish of soul--and what holy
   resolves he must have made during his three days' blindness and
   fasting!

   10, 11. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and
   to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias.

   And he said, Behold, I am here Lord. And the Lord said to him, Arise,
   and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the
   house of Judas for one called, Saul of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays.
   [See Sermon #16, Volume Paul's First

   PRAYER.] He had been a praying man for most of his life, for he

   was a devout Jew and, according to his light, he had lived up to his
   knowledge. But now he was praying in the Christian sense of the term,
   drawing near to God through the very Christ whom he had in his
   ignorance and unbelief persecuted! How many prayers of unregenerate
   men, who know not Christ, and are not constrained by His love, go for
   nothing! When they first from the heart confess their sin and cry to
   God for mercy, then they begin to really pray!

   12-16. And has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and
   putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight. Then Ananias
   answered Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has
   done to Your saints at Jerusalem: and here he has authority from the
   chief priests to bind all that call on Your name. But the Lord said
   unto him, go your way: for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My
   name before the gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: for I
   will show him how great things he must suffer for My name's sake. [See
   Sermon #944, Volume 16--an encouraging lesson FROM PAUL'S CONVERSION.]
   Ananias said to the Lord, "I have

   heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to Your saints at
   Jerusalem." And now the Lord says to Ananias, in response to that, "I
   will show him how great things he must suffer for My name's sake." As
   he had made others suffer for Christ's name's sake, he must, himself,
   suffer in the same way. Yet in this he was greatly favored, for it is
   one of the highest honors that the Lord Jesus Christ can put upon His
   chosen ones that they should be called to suffer for His name's sake!

   17-21. And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house and putting
   his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that
   appeared unto you in the way as you came, has sent me that you might
   receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit And immediately
   there fell from his eyes, as it had been scales: and he received sight
   forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. And when he had received food,
   he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples
   which were at Damascus. And straightway he preached Christ in the
   synagogues, that He is the Son of God. But all that heard him were
   amazed I should like to have heard one of those first sermons of the
   Apostle and to have seen the astonishment of the people as they
   listened to the converted persecutor--"All that heard him were
   amazed"--

   21, 22. And said; is not this he that destroyed them who called on this
   name in Jerusalem, and came here for that intent, that he might bring
   them bound unto the chief priests? But Saul increased the more in
   strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that
   this is very Christ.

   Chapter 22:1, 2. Men, brethren, and fathers, hear you my defense which
   I make now unto you. (And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew
   tongue to them, they kept the more silent) And he said-- Men like to be
   addressed in their own language. They give the more heed to the message
   if it is spoken to them in words that they can understand.

   3-9. I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in
   Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and
   taught according to the perfect manner of the Law of the fathers, and
   was zealous toward God, as you all are this day. And I persecuted this
   Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and
   women. As also the high priest does bear me witness, and all the estate
   of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren and
   went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem
   to be punished. And it came to pass that, as I made my journey, and was
   come near unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from Heaven a
   great light round about me. And I fell to the ground and heard a Voice
   saying to me, Saul, Saul, Why do you persecute Me? And I answered, Who
   are You, Lord? And He said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you
   persecute. And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were
   afraid; but they heard not the voice of Him that spoke to me. Paul's
   companions could not help sensing that extraordinary light and though
   they did not understand what it was, they were alarmed by it. They

   also heard a supernatural sound, but they could not comprehend what the
   voice of Jesus said to their leader as he lay prostrate upon the
   ground.

   10-12. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me,
   Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told you of all
   things which are appointed for you to do. And when I could not see for
   the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with
   me, I came into Damascus. And one Ananias, a devout man according to
   the Law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there. These
   particulars concerning the character of Ananias do not appear in the
   former part of the narrative. Paul was endeavoring to conciliate his
   hearers and, therefore, he mentioned that Ananias was a devout Jew,
   having a good report of all his brethren who dwelt in Damascus.

   13, 14. Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul,
   receive your sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. And he
   said, The God of our Fathers has chosen you, that you should know His
   will, and see that Just One and should hear the voice of His mouth. If
   Paul was to be an Apostle, it was necessary that he should see the Lord
   Christ, for one of the qualifications of an Apostle was that he should
   be able to bear witness, from his eyesight, and from his hearing, to
   the existence of the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore it was that Saul did,
   at that time, "see that Just One," and did "hear the voice of His
   mouth."

   15, 16. For you shall be His witness unto all men of what you have seen
   and heard. And now why do you tarry? Arise, and be baptized, and wash
   away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord. These two things were
   necessary-- first, he was to be baptized on profession of his faith in
   Jesus. And then he was to have in his soul a vivid consciousness that
   his sins were all washed away. This was not baptismal regeneration, for
   he was already regenerate! It was, however, the obedience to the Lord's
   command, which brought with it a sweet reassurance of the forgiveness
   of his sins.

   in Heaven." Hebrews 12:23.

   PAUL had just been giving a brief description of the great gathering of
   the children of Israel around Mount Sinai, "the mount that might be
   touched, and that burned with fire," like a huge volcano. He had
   vividly portrayed "the blackness, and darkness, and tempest, and the
   sound of trumpet, and the voice of words," and the frightened
   multitudes standing, trembling, at a distance, and even Moses, their
   great leader, so alarmed that he cried out, "I exceedingly fear and
   quake." Paul intends that description to teach us the effect that the
   legal dispensation can produce--it can alarm and condemn--but it cannot
   save! You who are under the Law of God, you who are trying to win God's
   favor by your good works. You who fancy that human merit can bring you
   salvation, look to the flames which Moses saw and sink, and tremble and
   despair! You who think that you can live as the Law requires and so
   attain to everlasting life, may well stand shivering and trembling
   before this Almighty, though invisible God whose lightning blazes
   before your eyes and whose voice of thunder must alarm the most stout
   heart! Terrible is the plight of the man who has to depend upon what
   Sinai can give him--he is wretched in life, he shall be troubled in
   death, he shall be lost forever in eternity! "By the works of the Law
   shall no flesh be justified." "As many as are of the works of the Law
   are under the curse." "By Grace are you saved through faith; and that
   not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man
   should boast."

   Having given that description of Sinai by way of contrast, Paul now
   brings out the much more pleasing picture of the Gospel dispensation.
   Christians shall also have their great assembly! There is a mountain
   upon which all those who are under Grace shall one day gather--a
   mountain that does not smoke, for it is Mount Zion--the city of the
   living God, the heavenly Jerusalem! There will be words there, but they
   will be words of sacred song and names of holy gladness. There may be
   trumpets there, but they will be the silver trumpets that will proclaim
   the eternal jubilee. Moses will be there, but no longer fearing and
   quaking, for when he comes to that mount of God, he will forget all his
   fears and rejoice without ceasing in the Lord his God. Believers are
   the multitude whom no man can number, who will assemble upon that
   glorious mountain to keep the everlasting holy day! Happy indeed shall
   we be when, by Grace, we come to the general assembly and Church of the
   first-born, whose names are written in Heaven--when we shall see that
   sight which was revealed to John in Patmos--a Lamb standing on the
   Mount Zion--and with Him those who have His Father's name written on
   their foreheads, who follow the Lamb wherever He goes and who are
   without fault before the Throne of

   God!

   The first point to which I am going to draw your attention is the
   description given of Believers as the Church of the First-Born. Next, I
   want to remind you of what is said about their enrolment--they are
   written or enrolled (as the original reading renders it) in Heaven. And
   then, thirdly, I shall have something to say concerning their great
   general assembly, when all the righteous shall be gathered to Christ,
   to be parted from Him no more forever.

   I. To begin then, from our text it seems that BELIEVERS IN CHRIST ARE
   DESCRIBED AS THE CHURCH OF THE FIRST-BORN. I shall try to make my
   remarks, as I utter them, self-examining, so that you and I may
   question ourselves to see whether we belong to this general assembly.

   By the term "first-born" is often meant, in Scripture, the most
   excellent, the chief. Jesus Christ, because of the excellence of His
   Character, is said to be "the first-born among many brethren," "the
   first-born of every creature," "the firstborn from the dead, that in
   all things He might have the preeminence." So, although Believers are,
   by nature, the child-

   ren of wrath, even as others, yet, after Christ has renewed them, they
   become the excellent of the earth in whom should be all our delight.
   Point me out a man who makes a profession of religion, but who is a
   drunk, and I will tell him at once that his profession is a lie! Show
   me another who says he is a follower of Christ, although he oppresses
   the poor, defrauds the laborer of his wages, is a covetous man who
   cares only for himself and shuts up his heart of compassion from his
   needy brethren--and I hesitate not to ask, "How dwells the love of God
   in him?" If the "Grace" we profess to have does not make us better than
   others, the sooner we get rid of it, the better! "What do you do more
   than others?" was the question of Christ to His disciples. "If you lend
   to them, of whom you hope to receive, what thanks have you? For sinners
   also lend to sinners, to receive as much again." Of Christians there is
   something to be expected that is not to be looked for in others--they
   profess to be twice-born, and to have God dwelling in them, as Paul
   says to the Corinthians, "Know you not that you are the temple of God,
   and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" Christians profess to be
   heirs of Heaven and members of the mystical body of Christ, so shall
   they talk and act as the ungodly do, and demean themselves as those do
   who have never received this new and higher life? God forbid! When
   Divine Grace comes, it lifts us up and keeps us up! And makes us new
   creatures in Christ Jesus, so that the evil things in which we once
   delighted, we do not so much as name, while anything that is virtuous
   or of good repute we pant after, that we may exhibit it to the praise
   of His Grace who has called us according to the counsel of His own
   will.

   Now, dear Friends, you can make this a test by which to try yourselves.
   What is your life? What fruits do you bring forth? If you bring forth
   thorns, surely you are brambles! If you bear the grapes of Gomorrah,
   surely you belong to Sodom's valley! "Do men gather grapes from thorns,
   or figs from thistles?" If the stream is foul, what must the fountain
   be? If the outside of your cup and platter is filthy, what must the
   inside be? If that which men see of you is foul, how foul must you be
   where only God can see you? We are, none of us, better than we seem,
   but we are, all of us, far worse than we think! May God tear away every
   veil which hides us from ourselves, that we may see ourselves even as
   we are in His sight!

   So you see that God's first-born are "a chosen generation, a royal
   priesthood, a holy nation," "a peculiar people, zealous of good works,"
   who seek to adorn the Doctrines of God their Savior in all things.

   But the term, "first-born," has a second meaning in Scripture. The
   first-born, under the old Mosaic economy, were chosen by God for
   Himself. When He smote the first-born of Egypt, He set apart for
   Himself all the first-born of Israel. He might have selected the
   youngest of the family, or the second, if He had chosen to do so, for
   God does as He wills and, "He gives not account of any of His matters."
   You may ask Him why He does this or that, but He deigns not to answer
   your inquisitive or impertinent enquiries. He is not disturbed by your
   questions. He never gives the reasons why He chooses any man unto
   salvation. That He does choose them is clear enough from Scripture, so
   clear that even such an unbeliever as Bolingbroke said to Mr.
   Whitefield one day, "Let it be taken for granted that the Bible is
   true, then no other Doctrine but Calvinism can be true, for the Bible
   teaches it from beginning to end." Certainly, if men's minds were not
   willfully perverted, they must read this Truth of God in such words as
   these, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have
   compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him
   that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God who shows mercy." And what
   says the Scripture when the sinner begins to quibble at this Truth of
   God? "No, but, O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the
   thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why have You made me thus? Has
   not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one
   vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?" It is a fact that God
   has ordained unto eternal life a multitude that no man can number! And
   just as the first-born among the Jews were typically elect, so the
   saints become saints as the result of the Divine decree passed long
   before the earth was created. When as yet this world and the sun and
   moon and stars slept in the mind of God like unborn forests in an acorn
   cup, even then had the Almighty written the names of all His chosen in
   the Lamb's Book of Life and fixed the place, the date, the very
   momentwhen they should be born--and when they should be born a second
   time--when they would come to Christ and so find salvation and
   everlasting life! This Doctrine is far from palatable to men, but,
   inasmuch as it glorifies God and makes man to be but as a grasshopper
   before the Eternal, we delight in it, and humbly bow before the
   Sovereign Disposer of all events and say, "It is the Lord; let Him do
   what seems good to Him."

   Then, thirdly, the first-born were inheritors of great privileges--of
   which we cannot just now speak particularly, but will do so further
   on--and they became so entirely by birth. The rights of the first-born
   lay only in his primogeniture--not in his stature, not in his
   comeliness or beauty, not in his mental capacity, not even in his moral
   virtues. If he was as lame as Mephibosheth, yet, if he was the
   first-born, he could not be disinherited! Or if, instead of having the
   to-

   wering stature of a Saul, he was as diminutive as Zacchaeus, yet, if he
   was the first-born, neither his parents nor all the courts of law could
   reverse the rights of primogeniture! So, Beloved, all those who are
   Believers in Christ, who are known to men by their excellence of
   character while God knows them by having chosen them by His Grace, are
   in time brought to realize their privileges through the new birth which
   is worked in them by the Holy Spirit. If we are born only once, we must
   die twice--but if we are born twice, we die but once--and after that
   one death which is not really death, we enter into eternal life!
   Regeneration makes us actually the children of God, just as adoption
   makes us virtually the children of God. By regeneration, we become
   really and truly heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ--and our
   right to Heaven, to all the blessings of the Covenant of Grace, and to
   the promises of God--arises from this new and heavenly birth! Heaven is
   the inheritance of the children of God, not a possession purchased by
   their money, or won by any deeds that they have done. This heritage is
   the birthright of all who have been born-again, born from above. So the
   question for everyone of us to ask is, "have I experienced this new
   birth?" "Except a man be born-again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."
   "That which is born of the flesh is flesh," and only flesh. "And that
   which is born of the Spirit is Spirit." And as Heaven and all the other
   blessings of the Covenant are spiritual, we cannot possess them until
   we are "born of the Spirit."

   The first-born, then, had certain rights because of their birth. And
   the first-born, spiritually, have certain rights because of their
   newbirth. May the Lord help you all to make sure work here! I pray you
   do not take it for granted that all is well with your soul, nor treat
   this question as though it were of little account. On the fact of your
   being born-again, or not being born-again, must hang your everlasting
   destiny! Live and die unregenerate, and unutterable woe will be your
   eternal portion. Pass from death unto life and all the glories of the
   Paradise of God become yours by a promise which death and the devil,
   himself, cannot break! Have you passed from death unto life? How can
   you tell that? "By their fruits you shall know them," is our Lord's own
   test! Do you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ? Are you trusting alone
   in Him? These are vital questions and if you can truly say--

   "My hope is built on nothing less Then Jesus' blood and
   righteousness"-- and if that hope is accompanied by the faith which
   works by love and purifies the heart and life, then you are one of the
   children of God! And in that fact you may well "rejoice with joy
   unspeakable, and full of glory."

   Now, fourthly, upon the first-born, more than upon any others, God was
   pleased to multiply the types of redemption in order to show to us very
   plainly that the heirs of Heaven are a redeemed people. First of all,
   the great majority of the first-born were redeemed by blood. In the
   dark and dreadful night, the destroying angel is let loose with
   noiseless wings and with a sharp sword that never misses its mark. He
   is speeding from house to house throughout all the land of Egypt, and
   from the first-born of Pharaoh upon the throne, to the first-born of
   the slave women behind the mill, they fall dead! And Egypt's wail goes
   up to Heaven in an exceedingly bitter and piercing cry. But throughout
   the houses of the Israelites a different scene is being witnessed. The
   doors are shut, a roasted lamb lies upon the table and men and women
   stand around it, girt as for a journey, with their staves in their
   hands--and they eat in haste. There is a first-born child in his
   mother's arms, or a first-born male who is grown up, yet they show no
   sign of trepidation, though it is well known that, on that night, the
   first-born are to die! Why are they so calm? Had you been present, an
   hour or two ago, you would have seen that the father, when he slew the
   lamb, drained the warm lifeblood into a bowl and, as his children
   gathered about him, he said to them, "Come, follow me." And taking with
   him a bunch of hyssop, he went to the outside of his door, and smote
   the lintel till it was crimsoned with the blood of the lamb. And then
   he sprinkled the posts on either side so that the blood-mark was all
   about the door. "And now," he said, "my children, we are safe, for when
   God sees the blood, He will pass over us, and our first-born will not
   be slain--the blood will make them secure." In like manner we who are
   the first-born of God are saved by the blood of Jesus! Can you, Friend,
   by faith say, "My confidence is in that blood alone"? Has it been
   applied to your heart and conscience? Has it spoken peace to your soul?
   Does it cleanse you from all sin? Do you now rejoice that there is no
   condemnation to you, as you are in Christ Jesus, and He has endured the
   whole of the Divine Wrath that was your due because of your sin?

   But lest we should not learn this great Truth by one type, God has
   given us another. In the course of two years, over 22,000 children were
   born to that large population, and these had not been redeemed by the
   blood of the paschal lambs, for they were not then in being. So another
   method was adopted--a Levite was to stand in the place of each
   first-born

   male child and God accepted the Levite, and allowed the child to remain
   in his father's house. Here was a symbol of the great truth of
   Substitution, but the privileges which appertained to some of the
   Jewish first-born in the type belong to all the spiritual first-born
   children of God. Christ is the Levite who stands before God in our
   place and who there ministers for us, and honors His Father's Law, and
   fulfils its every jot and tittle on our behalf. There were 273
   first-born Jewish children for whom no Levite substitute could be
   found, so five shekels per head had to be paid to Aaron and his sons as
   redemption money for them. And, in like manner, the Divine plan of
   Redemption is very rightly set forth by the Apostle Peter when he says,
   "You know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver
   and gold...but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish, and without spot."

   Put these three things together--redemption by blood, redemption by
   substitution, and redemption by purchase-- and you will then have a
   very clear idea of what Atonement in reference to the first-born means.
   Any one of the three will be sufficient for the enlightened saint, but
   the whole together will reflect a beautiful light upon the Cross of
   Christ--and in that light we may clearly see how He bore our sins in
   His own body on the tree and brought in everlasting Redemption for all
   His chosen. Let each one of us put these questions to himself or
   herself, "Am I redeemed with the precious blood of Christ? Did He stand
   as Substitute and Surety for me? Am I bought with the price that He
   paid for His people on the Cross? For, if not, I cannot be numbered
   among the first-born, for all the first-born must be redeemed in this
   way."

   Our time flies so quickly that I am afraid the other two divisions of
   my discourse will have to suffer. But I must remind you, as I promised
   to do, that the first-born, having been redeemed, had very special
   privileges. First, they had a double portion of their father's goods.
   Hence, Elisha, who was, in the prophetic sense, the first-born of
   Elijah, pleaded with him as his spiritual son, "I pray you, let a
   double portion of your spirit be upon me." Now God is good to all men,
   and His tender mercies are over all His works, but His special favor is
   reserved for the called and chosen, and faithful ones whom He has
   redeemed. The first-born also had the privilege of priesthood in the
   old patriarchal times, and every true child of God is made a king and a
   priest unto God, to offer daily, spiritual and acceptable sacrifices
   through Jesus Christ. The first-born was, in many respects, a ruler
   over the whole household--and Christ, the great First-Born--is the
   supreme Ruler over His Church, and we, in and through Him, are made
   rulers over many things. And He bids us ascend the throne and reign
   with Him as God's first-born, kings and priests unto Him forever.

   II. Now, secondly, and but very briefly, let us enquire WHAT IS MEANT
   BY THE ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST-BORN?

   Moses had to set down the names of the Jewish first-born. And we find
   that right down to the Apostles' age, there were some who were very
   busy about what Paul calls "endless genealogies, which minister
   questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith." But, dear
   Friends, there is an enrollment about which we should be greatly
   concerned. There are certain names written in the Lamb's Book of Life
   and it should be to you and to me a matter of solemn interest to
   enquire if our names are written there. Is your name, is my name,
   inscribed upon that secret, sacred roll of the elect of God? We cannot
   scale the heights of Heaven to search the pages of that sealed book,
   nor can we discover the secrets that the Most High has recorded there.
   It is impossible for us to read our names there, yet there are certain
   evidences by which we can tell whether they are or are not there!

   First of all, do you think they are there Are there not many here who
   must truthfully say, "No, we have no reason to think they are"? When
   the muster-roll of our troops is called, if you are there, you can hear
   the names and the men's answers. "John So-and-So?" "Here, Sir."
   "Thomas?" "Here, Sir." "Here, Sir." "Here, Sir," and so it goes all
   down the ranks. Now, suppose it could be possible for an angel to read
   from this pulpit the muster-roll of the redeemed? Do you think that he
   would read your name, and that you would be able to answer, "Here,
   Sir"? "No," you say, "unless I tell a willful lie, I dare not say that
   I think my name is in the Lamb's Book of Life." Well then, if your own
   hearts condemn you, remember that God is greater than your hearts and
   knows all things--so how much more must He condemn you!

   Possibly there are some who say, "We hope our names are written there."
   So I ask you, dear Friends, are you like those whose names undoubtedly
   are inscribed there? Have you the faith of Abraham, or something like
   it? Do you desire to have such holiness as Paul craved? When you read
   the record of a good man's life, do you feel that your life is in
   conformity with his? For character, character, CHARACTERmust, after
   all, be the great ground of judgment! And if your life is not like the
   life of the saints, how can you hope to find your name recorded where
   their names are written?

   Again, all the elect have their names written beneath the name of their
   Lord, the Lamb. So, are you trusting in Christ? Are you resting in Him?
   Is your life linked with His? Do you feel that there is a bond that
   cannot be snapped, which binds you and Christ together so that no one
   and nothing that can possibly happen shall be able to separate you from
   the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus your Lord? Very well then, if
   this is the case with you, rest assured that your name is in that book!
   But, "without Christ," you are without hope! Separated from Him, it is
   certain that your name is not written in Heaven, as one of "the general
   assembly and Church of the First-Born."

   I ask you another question, are you really a child of God? Can you say
   to Him, "Abba, Father"? Is God your Father? Have you learned to trust
   Him as His children trust Him and to love Him as His children love Him?
   Do you depend wholly upon Him? Do you seek to submit yourself entirely
   to His will and to walk in His Way? For, if you are not a child of God
   at all, certainly you are not one of His first-born!

   I must also ask, Have you passed from death unto life Has there ever
   been a vital change in you--such a change as can only be worked by the
   Holy Spirit? I do not mean such a change as some silly people talk of
   seeing, sometimes, when a man is dying. There may have been no sign of
   Grace whatever in the man, yet someone said, "I saw such a change come
   over him, his face looked so different." Very likely it did, but it is
   not a change of face that is needed, but a change of heart! It is no
   physical change, but a mental, moral, spiritual, Divine change that is
   worked in regeneration! Let not any one of you be satisfied unless you
   have unquestionable evidence that this change has been worked in you by
   the effectual working of the Holy Spirit, for unless you are
   born-again, your name will not be found written upon the roll of God's
   first-born!

   Now, in closing, let me remind you that to all these first-born of God,
   whose names are written in Heaven, the day is coming when they shall be
   assembled around the Throne of God in Glory. What a meeting that will
   be! There shall not be one unholy person there, for they shall all have
   been washed white in the blood of the Lamb! How happy they will all be!
   There shall be no tears in any eye, nor a groan in any spirit, nor a
   single note of sorrow on any tongue, for the days of their mourning
   shall be ended forever! How united an assembly it will be! There shall
   be no heresy, no schism, no discord, no coldness of heart--they shall
   all love even as they have been loved! What a vast assembly it will be!
   And when ten thousand times ten thousand meet together there, what a
   shout of sacred joy it shall be when they lift up hallelujah upon
   hallelujah! John says, "I heard a voice from Heaven, as the voice of
   many waters." You may have heard the sea roar in the fullness of its
   strength. Possibly you have heard the mighty Atlantic Ocean booming on
   the shore when lashed to fury by a storm. Such is to be the grandeur of
   the singing before the Throne of God in the general assembly and Church
   of the First-Born--only it is not merely to be like the voice of one
   water, but of many waters--oceans piled upon oceans, the Atlantic upon
   the Pacific, and the Arctic and the Antarctic, and all other oceans
   piled upon these! And such shall be the music of the saints! Such shall
   be the song of the blessed when they see their Father's face without a
   veil and pour out their vast volume of praise "as the voice of many
   waters."

   Let each one of us ask himself or herself, "Shall I be there?" If
   anyone says, "I fear that I shall not be there," let him cry mightily
   unto the Most High to pull him out of the horrible Pit and to set his
   feet upon the Rock and to establish his goings. Sinner, you will either
   be there or in that dreadful place where the wailings shall be more
   terrible than the cry of men in a battle or the shrieks of women in a
   massacre! You will either be up there in Glory or else down there where
   darkness, death and long despair sit on their thrones of woe! Fly,
   Sinner, fly away to Christ! His wounds, like clefts in the rock, are
   open to the doves that need a shelter. Fly, Sinner, fly! The avenger of
   blood pursues you! I hear the sound of his feet close behind you and he
   is about to strike you dead! But the City of Refuge is near at hand,
   standing with open gates ready to welcome you! Fly, Sinner, fly!
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." To believe on Jesus is to
   trust Him. To be baptized is to be immersed in water upon profession of
   that faith.

   I dare not alter my Master's commission--"Go you into all the world and
   preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved: but he that believes not shall be damned." There is no
   other alternative! Turn or burn! Believe and be saved, or disbelieve
   and be lost! May God, in His mercy, make the choice for you, Sinner,
   this very hour, and lead you in the Way everlasting. And unto Father,
   Son and Holy Spirit shall be the glory forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HEBREWS 12.

   After giving a long list of the heroes of faith, the Apostle adds--

   Verses 1-3. Therefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great
   a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which
   does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is
   set before us, looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith;
   who for the joy that was set before Him endured the Cross, despising
   the shame, and is set down at the right hand on the Throne of God. For
   consider Him--[See Sermon #1073, Volume 18--a honeyCOMB.] Look to Him,
   look at Him! Study Him-know all you

   can about Him--meditate upon Him--

   3, 4. That endured such contradiction of sinners against Himself lest
   you be wearied and faint in your minds. You have not yet resisted unto
   blood, striving against sin. It has not yet come to that with any of
   you who are now here. You have not shed your yet blood for Christ, for
   these are not martyr days--so can you be wearied and faint? If you run
   with the footmen and they weary you, how will you contend with horses?
   We ought to be ashamed of ourselves if we grow weary in a race that is
   so easy compared with that of the men and women who laid down their
   lives for Christ's sake!

   5. And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to
   children, My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint
   when you are rebuked by Him. Both these states are wrong--either to
   think nothing of chastisement or else to faint under it--we are not to
   fall into either evil, but to keep the golden mean between them.

   6. For whom the Lord loves. The Greek word is a strong one and means,
   "whom the Lord tenderly loves"--

   6. He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives. Everyone does
   not receive the same measure of chastise-ment--but he who has the
   largest share of the love of God will feel the most of His chastising
   hand. Are you not willing to take that portion and to be among the
   Lord's tenderly loved ones?

   7. If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what
   son is he whom the father chastens not?God had one Son without sin, but
   He never had a son without suffering. And the Son who was without sin
   was the "Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief."

   8. But if you are without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then
   are you bastards, and not sons. If you are without chastisement, you
   may bear the name of sons, but you are not really so--you are mere
   professors.

   9. Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and
   we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto
   the Father of Spirits, and live?Should we not give Him reverence when
   we are chastened, instead of murmuring and complaining against Him,
   thus calling Him to account at our judgment seat? Oh, yes, let us be in
   willing subjection to Him, and the more willingly subject we are, the
   less painful will the chastisement be. Our most bitter sorrow will be
   found at the root of our self-will--and when our self-will is gone, the
   bitterness of our sorrow will be past.

   10. For they verily for a few days chastened us after their
   ownpleasure; but He for ourproft, that we might bepar-takers of His
   holiness. Is there no way for us to "be partakers of His holiness" but
   through chastening? It would seem so from the wording of this verse!
   The Lord, as our loving Father, makes use of the rod that He may make
   us to be truly holy.

   11. Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous,How could it
   be? It would lose the very nature of chastening if there were joy in
   it.

   11. But grievous: nevertheless afterward--[See Sermon #528, Volume
   9--CHASTISEMENT--NOW AND AFTERWARDS.] These are truly blessed words,
   "nevertheless afterward"--

   11-13. It yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them who are
   exercised thereby. Therefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the
   feeble knees; and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is
   lame be turned out of the

   way; but let it rather be healed. [See Sermon #2543, Volume 49--LAME
   SHEEP.] Come, children of God, do not be despondent because of your
   tribulations. You are in a race, so run even while you are smarting
   from your chastisements! Still run, and keep on running until you win
   the prize!

   14. Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall
   see the Lord. [See Sermon #2902, Volume 50--

   HOLINESS DEMANDED.] The holy God can only be seen by holy eyes.

   He must make us like Himself before we can see Him.

   15. Looking diligently lest any man fail of the Grace of God. Seeming
   to have Divine Grace and yet not really having it.

   15. Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby
   many are defiled. [See Sermon #940, Volume 16--the

   WINNOWING FAN.] Sin is a bitter thing and a defiling thing and

   unless we look diligently, it will grow in our hearts like the weeds
   grow in our gardens after a heavy rain--it will spring up before we are
   aware of it.

   16. Lest there be any fornicator. Fornication was far too common in the
   early Church, but it was not thought to be sin by the great mass of the
   heathen! But, oh, what a defiling sin it is!

   16. Or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his
   birthright. He was thus guilty of spiritual fornication, preferring his
   meat to his Maker, thinking more of one morsel of meat than of his
   birthright.

   17. For you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the
   blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though
   he sought it carefully with tears. He could not get his father to
   change his mind concerning Jacob. On the contrary, he said, "I have
   blessed him; yes, and he shall be blessed." His many tears availed
   not--they were not repenting tears, but only selfish ones. He did not
   repent that he had bartered his birthright for a mess of pottage--he
   regretted that he had lost the blessing, that was all.

   18-21. For you are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and
   that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
   and the sound of a trumpet, and the Voice of words; which Voice they
   that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any
   more: (for they could not endure that which was commanded, and if so
   much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust
   through with a dart: and so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I
   exceedingly fear and quake). We have not come to that mount of terror,
   for we are not under the Law but under Grace--we have come to a very
   different place from that.

   22-24. But you are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the
   living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of
   angels, to the general assembly and Church of the First-Born, which are
   written in Heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of
   just men made perfect. And to Jesus, the Mediator of the New Covenant,
   and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of
   Abel. [See Sermons #211, Volume 4--the voice of the

   BLOOD OF CHRIST; #708, Volume12--THE BLOOD OF ABLE AND THE BLOOD OF
   JESUS; #1888, Volume 32--THE BLOOD OF SPRINKLING (FIRST SERMON) and
   #1889, Volume 32--THE BLOOD OF SPRINKLING (SECOND SERMON).] We are

   come to that blood, and it is that blood which has made such a change
   in us! We may rejoice together, now, and we ought to do so if we are
   all one in Christ Jesus.

   25-29. See that you refuse not Him that speaks. For if they escaped not
   who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more shall not we escape, if
   we turn away from Him that speaks from Heaven: whose Voice then shook
   the earth: but now He has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not
   the earth, only, but also Heaven. And this word, yet once more,
   signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things
   that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
   Therefore we, receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have
   Grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly
   fear: for our God is a consuming fire. Not "God out of Christ," as some
   say, but God in Christ! God is a consuming fire anyway and we should
   each one pray, "Consuming Fire, Refining Fire, go through my heart and
   purge me of all that can be consumed! Holy Spirit, drive out of me all
   that can be shaken and removed, that only Your abiding Kingdom may
   remain in me, and Yours shall be the praise and the glory forever!
   Amen."

Secret Disciples Encouraged

   (No. 3207)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 21, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Are not you also one of His disciples?" John 18:25.

   BLESSED be His name, there are some of us who count it our highest joy
   to answer this question, "Yes." Whatever may be entailed by the
   confession, we shall be glad to endure! We could not do otherwise than
   say, "He acknowledged us of old and He is still not ashamed to call us
   brethren and, therefore, we are not ashamed of Him, but we delight to
   call Him Master and Lord." In an interview I had about a fortnight ago,
   with a dear and venerable friend who is just upon the borders of the
   grave, he said to me, "There is a verse in the Hymn-Hook which I know
   you do not like, Sir, and which I do not like, though both of us have
   sometimes been obliged to sing it--

   "Tis a point I long to know,

   Oft it causes anxious thought

   Do I love the Lord, or no?

   Am I His, or am I not?"

   "But I have no doubt about it," he went on to say, "any more than I
   have about my own existence! Let others doubt if they like. I know I
   love the Lord. I am sure I do. If there is anything in all this world
   that is beyond a question to me, it is that I do love Him with all my
   heart, soul and strength." That ought to be the condition of every
   Christian! There ought to be no question here. We should, each one, be
   able to reply at once, when asked, "Are not you also one of His
   disciples?" "I am! I count it my honor, my joy that He permits me to
   sit at His feet and to be instructed by Him, and to go forth into the
   world bearing His reproach." But, at the same time, dear Friends, there
   are some in the world who could not go that length, of whom,
   nevertheless, we have the hopeful belief that they are His disciples.

   I thought of speaking a little to such persons. This, perhaps, will be
   unfortunate for most of you, for I shall not be addressing many,
   perhaps, here present. Still, if there are but a few such, we must look
   after the one at the risk even of leaving the ninety-nine. So I address
   myself to those whom we assuredly suspect to be followers of Jesus,
   concerning whose faith we need to have a little better evidence and
   whose life we would see a little more consistent with their being truly
   His followers.

   I. First, then, I would ask, WHY ARE YOU SUSPECTED OF BEING A DISCIPLE
   OF CHRIST? Please observe the reasons why Simon Peter was suspected,
   for the same reasons may be applicable to you.

   He was suspected by some of being a disciple of Christ because he had
   been seen with the disciples. One of the servants of the high priest
   said to Peter, "Did not I see you in the garden with Him?" Now, there
   are some of you who are always seen in the House of God--not only at
   stated services which are attended by the general public, but you are
   seen at the Prayer Meetings, you are seen at times when the interest is
   more spiritual--and when only the spiritual, it would be supposed,
   would be attracted and find anything that would interest them--there
   are you found. It is not only in the House of God that you are seen
   with Christ's people, but out-of-doors, too. You do not enjoy frivolous
   society. You are not at home in the haunts of vanity. Your companions
   are the godly. You delight in their conversation and the more spiritual
   the conversation becomes, the more you enjoy it!

   Now, I do not know that you are a follower of Christ, but I have a
   strong suspicion that you may be and I would like to put these
   questions to you, if I might. "Are not you, also, one of His disciples?
   Did not I see you in the garden with Him? Why do you keep such company
   and love such society, if you are not one of them? Is not the old
   proverb true, 'Birds of a feather flock together'? How is it that you
   love the footsteps of the flock and the way of the shepherd's tents, if

   you are not one of the sheep? I dare not say that you are, for I cannot
   read your heart, but I will venture again to put the question, 'Are not
   you also one of His disciples?'"

   They suspected him, again, because of his conversation. Peter did not
   want to be known and, therefore, I do not suppose that he voluntarily
   said anything that would betray him. I daresay, if he conversed at all
   at the fire, he kept clear of all topics and subjects that would reveal
   him, or lead to the question being put as to whether he was a disciple
   or not, but, somehow or other, whatever he talked about, there was a
   sort of brogue, a twang in his speech, a something which showed that,
   at any rate, he was a Galilean--and they began to suspect that he might
   also be a companion of Jesus of Nazareth. It was his talk that betrayed
   him!

   Now I do not know, dear Friend, whether you are a disciple of Christ,
   and I do not propose to press you to tell me, but excuse my asking the
   question. Your language and accent have about them a seasoning and a
   flavor of Christianity. You earnestly put aside from your speech
   everything unclean and you delight to speak words that honor Christ. If
   at any time in conversation there is a word said that seems to reflect
   upon the Lord Jesus, you are grieved at it and you would not repeat any
   sentiment or sentence that would dishonor Him. You are cautious and
   careful, too, about truth in your speech. You also desire to speak for
   the good of others. Especially during the last few months you have been
   very particular, and your prayer has been, "Open You my lips." You have
   been afraid of speaking those idle words for which God will bring men
   into judgment. Now, I do not know that you are Christ's disciple, but I
   suspect it, for a man is judged by his speech. We generally know what
   is in the well by what comes up in the bucket, and the metal of a bell
   can be pretty well judged by the stroke of the clapper. And I think we
   can form some estimate of who you must be when we perceive in your
   conversation the tone of a Christian, when we hear that you speak as
   one does whose heart has been renewed by Divine Grace. I shall,
   therefore, put the question to you, expecting an affirmative answer,
   "Are not you also one of His disciples?"

   Further than this, Peter was recognized, I suspect, as having acted for
   his Lord, for the person who said, "Did not I see you in the garden
   with Him?" was a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off. As for
   you, it is not long since you were angry when someone had blasphemed or
   spoken unkind words against one of God's servants, or against God's
   Gospel. I am not sure that you did well to be angry, but at any rate,
   it was a holy zeal that made you angry. Why, you were quite red in the
   face as you defended the Truth of God! I say again, I am not sure that
   you did well to be angry, but at any rate, while you were cutting off
   that fellow's ear with that sharp sword of yours, and dealing such hard
   blows for Christ--if I had been there to see you, I would have thought
   that you were one of His disciples--even though I would have known that
   your Master would not have wished you to use that sword, or to be so
   violent as you were. Yet your very zeal for Him though, perhaps, it was
   indiscreet, and perhaps not altogether what He could approve, showed
   that you really had some love to Him, some concern for His cause, some
   zeal for His Glory. Is it not so? Surely you are also one of His
   disciples! These things led them to suspect Peter, and these things
   lead us to suspect you.

   One other thing, I doubt not there was about Peter, as he stood warming
   himself by the fire--he was especiallyinterested in the fate of Jesus.
   Alas for him, he had so far forgotten himself that he tried, perhaps,
   to avoid showing that he took any particular interest in the trial. But
   I will guarantee you that those who could read faces could read
   something in Peter's face as it was lit up by the glare of the coals!
   When he heard them smite his Master with the palms of their hands upon
   His cheek, did you not see that tear roll down his face? He pretended
   he was brushing away a drop of sweat from his brow, but anyone who was
   watching him, especially one with the quick eyes of the maid that
   spoke, could see that it was a dewdrop of another sort that was falling
   from his eye!

   Now, you have not saidthat you are a disciple of Christ, but have we
   not sometimes caught you unawares and read it in your face? The other
   Sunday, when we spoke of the Redeemer's sufferings, your soul was
   melted. When we talked of His glories, we could see how you exulted in
   the theme. And when the Gospel was freely preached to the chief of
   sinners, your eyes looked as if you understood it--and as if you loved
   it. Though, perhaps, even now, you would hardly venture to say, "I am
   saved," yet you experience a joy and delight in hearing the Truth of
   God which you would not have known if you had not been one of Christ's
   disciples--and a holy trembling and heart-searching under the Word of
   God that you would not have experienced unless you had been first of
   all quickened by the Spirit of His Grace. Yes, the countenance will
   often betray what is going on within--and those dear ones who are
   saved--I have no doubt they have observed about you a great many things
   and have compelled them cheerfully to say, "We believe So-and-So is a
   Christian. We can-

   not doubt it. There is a something about his whole manner and
   conversation, his manner of speech, his mode of thought and style of
   action that betrays him as being a disciple of Christ."

   Now, Beloved Friend, I cannot follow you home and judge as to your
   secret life, but I will put this question to you in various ways, in
   which, of course, I must leave Simon Peter out of the question. You
   have lately put your trust in Christ Jesus, alone. That is to say, if
   you have not done so, or if you are not sure you have done so, at any
   rate you have not any other trust and all the trust you have is set on
   Him. You see that there is an end of all perfection in the flesh and
   you are looking for the perfection which He gave to His people when He
   finished His atoning Sacrifice and sat down at the right hand of God.
   Though you cannot see much light, yet you know that there is no light
   except in Him and you have cast away forever that false light in which
   you once rejoiced. Well, I am glad, and I am inclined to put to you the
   question, "Are not you also one of His disciples?"

   You have lately begun to pray and that not as a matter of form. You
   have left off that form you once repeated and now you pray from your
   very heart. Sometimes you cannot pray as you would--in fact, you never
   do make your petition quite such as you desire. Still, you pray as well
   as you can, with groans and tears and longings that you may be taught
   how to pray better. Well, I never yet heard of a praying soul that was
   not one of Christ's disciples! It was a token that Saul of Tarsus was a
   convert to Christ when it was said, "Behold, he prays." So I will put
   to you the question, since you utter the living prayer of a truly
   earnest soul, "Are not you also--despite your doubts, questions, and
   humble lamentations--are not you one of His disciples?"

   Moreover, you now have an interest in the Word of God. The Bible was
   very dull to you once. A three-volume novel pleased you much better.
   But now anything that will tell you of your Lord and of His love, and
   will instruct you in His Truth--anything of that sort you care for--you
   have a hungering after it. Well, I have not yet known dead people
   become hungry and I do not know that I ever yet heard of a carrion crow
   that desired to feed on the food of the dove! I think there must be
   some change in you, or you would not love the clean winnowed grain
   which delights God's children. I am not sure about it, but still, I
   shall venture to put the question and believe that I know what answer
   you will give, "Are not you also one of His disciples?"

   Besides, you know that there is a change in your life. As a child, you
   are now striving to honor your parents. As a tradesman, you have now
   left off many practices that you once allowed yourself to adopt. As a
   common man speaking to others, you are now more charitable in your
   words than you used to be. There are things that were once amusements
   to you which yielded you pleasure, but which have now become vanity of
   vanities to you. Now you know that when you rise in the morning, the
   thing you are most afraid of is that you should do wrong during the
   day--and if you are troubled at night, it is because you have done a
   wrong. And the matter that pains you about it most is not the loss of
   custom, but the loss of a peaceful conscience. Now, I think if you are
   all this, surely you are also one of Christ's disciples!

   I have suggested many hopeful things that would lead me to think that
   you are His disciple, but if you are not, then assuredly you are His
   enemy! What do you think of that? If I should make a list of this
   congregation and should write down all the disciples of Christ,
   (supposing I were able to do that), and if my pen were just about to be
   withdrawn from the paper, could you bear that I should say, "I am about
   to close this roll. I have written down all the disciples of Christ
   here. I have finished the list, and your name is not there"? I am sure
   you would say, "Oh, stay your hand a while, Sir! I was afraid I was not
   one of His, but now it comes to the push, I dare not withhold my name!"
   And I am certain that if I were then to take another roll and to begin
   to write down the names of all those who did not believe in Jesus, you
   would say, "Oh, no, do not do that! Stop a moment. Do not let my name
   be written down there! I could not stand that, for I think I am not
   quite His enemy. At any rate, I long to be His disciple."

   I sometimes wish you would push yourself into this corner. If it came
   to the point, Beloved--if it really came to the point--some of you who
   have said, "I am afraid I do not love Him," because you do not love Him
   as you ought. Some of you who have said, "I am afraid I do not trust
   Him," because you have some doubts and some fears, I have no doubt that
   if it came to the point, notwithstanding all things, God would lead you
   to trust Him and to rejoice in Him! Remember that story of one of the
   martyrs who had been condemned to die for Christ, and who, about a week
   before he died, was full of fear and trembling? He was afraid of the
   fire and much cast down by the prospect of being burned. There was a
   fellow prisoner with him who scolded him for it and told him that he
   ought to trust in God, that he ought not to be dismayed, and ought not
   to be cast down. When the day came for them to burn together, the poor,
   weak, trembling man stood on the firewood and he said, before the fire
   was kindled, "Oh, He has come! He has come! He has come and He has
   filled my soul with His Presence!" He died triumphantly, while the
   other man, who had scolded him for his lack of faith, recanted at the
   last moment and became a traitor to the Truth of God. The Lord will
   help you if you are but right toward Him. Still, I pray that you may be
   delivered from every question about whether you are His disciple or
   not.

   II. Now, having thus uttered my suspicions about some of you, I shall,
   in the second place, demand from those of you who seem to be Christ's
   disciples, WHY DO YOU NOT ACT AS IF YOU WERE A DISCIPLE? "Are not you
   also one of His disciples?

   Why, then, are you not sharing His reproach?Peter is standing there
   warming his hands, looking to his personal comfort. His Master is over
   yonder being despised and rejected, maltreated and smitten. If you are
   one of His disciples, Peter, is this the place for you--among the
   ribald crowd around the fire? Is not your proper place at your Lord's
   side, to be laughed at as He is, falsely accused as He is, and buffeted
   as He is? I may be speaking to some who love Christ, or are to be
   suspected of it, but they have never borne His reproach. You are not
   numbered with any Christian Church because well, it is not a very
   respectable thing in the circle in which you move! You have not
   professed those Truths of God which you have believed because it would
   render you extremely unpopular if you did! You have not said in your
   household, "I am a Christian," because it is clear to you that your
   husband might not like it, or that your father might not have patience
   with it. You have slunk into the workshop and you have hidden your
   colors and you have been comfortable with ungodly men--and when they
   have uttered hard things about Christ, though you have not liked what
   they said, you have not expressed your disapproval--and so your silence
   gave consent to them.

   "Are not you also one of His disciples," and do you refuse to share the
   reproach of Christ? Have you forgotten Moses, who, though he might have
   been like a king in Egypt, yet took his place with the poor despised,
   enslaved Israelites, "esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches
   than the treasures in Egypt"? Can you not take your place with Christ's
   poor people? Are you ashamed of them because they are not titled and
   rich, or because their literary standing is not very high? Are you
   ashamed of them because other people misrepresent and slander them? Has
   the offense of the Cross ceased? Do you expect that true Christianity
   will ever be fashionable? Do you believe for a moment, in your heart,
   that Christ spoke a lie when He said to His disciples, "Behold, I send
   you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves"? If there is a religion
   concerning which all men speak well, woe be unto it, for it cannot be
   the religion of Christ! Do you not know that the way to Heaven is
   upstream? The current runs downward to the Gulf of Destruction! Are you
   not willing to take the Cross and go against popular opinion--and
   against everything else that is necessary for Christ's sake?

   The day comes when they who have been ashamed of His Cross will find
   themselves losing His crown. "No Cross, no crown." This is what Christ,
   Himself, says "Whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My Words, of him
   shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He shall come in His own Glory,
   and in His Father's, and of the holy angels." If you dare not follow
   Him because you fear shame--shame shall be your perpetual inheritance!
   Remember that verse, "But the fearful, and unbelieving...shall have
   their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is
   the second death." Oh, that we may never be among those cowards, for
   those are the persons He means, not the fearing ones, but the fearful
   ones who dare not be reproached for Him! Is there listening to these
   words one who loves his Lord and knows the Truth, and knows where God's
   Church is, but has been afraid to join His people--ashamed to confess
   the Truth and to follow Christ? I come to you with this word and I
   would gladly look you in the face and say, "Are not you also one of His
   disciples?" Yet you go in and out with the ungodly and you warm your
   hands at their fire! And you are mirthful with their jollity and you
   are pleased with their ungodliness. "Come out from among them, and be
   you separate, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing." Confess
   Christ before men that He may confess you before His Father and the
   angels in Heaven!

   Again, if you are among Christ's disciples, why are you not witnessing
   for HimP. It was not only that Peter was not sharing His shame, but
   that when Christ was on trial, it was due to Him that every person who
   could have spoken a good word for Him should do it--but everyone was
   silent. When Christ said, "I spoke openly," Peter might have said,
   "Yes, I have heard all He said and I have never heard Him utter
   sedition or blasphemy! Nothing of the kind has ever come from my
   Master's lips. If anything has been spoken in secret, I have been
   there. I have been with John and James in the most select circle of all
   His disciples and thus, too, I can bear witness that He is innocent."
   But, no, Peter is silent and instead of witnessing he denies his
   Master!

   It is the duty of every Christian to be witnessing for Christ. Jesus is
   still on trial every day. He stands before the world, as it were, at
   this very hour, and the question is--Is He the Son of God or not?
   Witnesses are being examined every day for Him and against Him. "What
   do you think of Christ?" is a question which is stirring all this city
   and all lands, more or less! And now shall He who claims to be the
   Savior of men and the Head of the Church--shall He, while so many speak
   against Him, lack the evidence of anyone who knows Him, who has been
   with Him and loves Him? There are some of us who find it sweet to
   witness for Him that He is the very Christ of God--and we do not take
   any honor to ourselves for so doing--for flesh and blood have not
   revealed it to us!

   But is anyone keeping back his testimony? "Why," asks one "what would
   mytestimony be worth?" You do not know what it would be worth. "Nobody
   would notice me. I am only a humble woman in my family." What? Have you
   no desire that your family should know the Truth of God? Have you one
   little child on your knee, and have you never put your arms about that
   little one's neck and prayed that she might belong to Jesus, or that
   the boy might be the Savior's? Have you never told those darlings of
   yours what Christ has done for you? You could not do it, do you say?
   Not talk to your own child of what is written in your own heart
   concerning your own Lord? Ah, if you cannot, cry to God against such a
   disability and be not satisfied till you have conquered your unholy
   shame, for unholy it is! If you are also one of His disciples, bear
   your witness to Him, even if it is but one who can hear it! If that one
   is all the congregation that God sends you, you have done your part. I
   am not accountable for the people that hear me, but only for the
   witness that I bear! And you shall not be accountable for the largeness
   or smallness of your sphere, but for the faithfulness of your testimony
   for Christ. Tell all with whom you come in contact that He is your
   Savior, a precious Savior, a true Promiser, a Promise-Keeper, a
   faithful Friend, a Helper in life and in death! And I say again you
   know not what may be the value of your testimony, for if it is borne
   but to a child, that child may grow up to bear testimony to tens of
   thousands! You know not what may come of a spark of fire. Do but let it
   drop and you may set half a continent on a blaze! "Are not you also one
   of His disciples?" If you are, then bear your witness as well as take
   up your cross!

   Now, diverging a little from what some of you will think most
   practical, let me ask, "Are not you also one of His disciples?" Then
   why are you not enjoying the privileges which belong to His
   disciples?You have not been baptized! Yet He who said, "Believe," also
   said, "Be baptized." It is written of some, "These are they which
   follow the Lamb wherever He goes." I ask you, did not the Lamb go down
   into the Jordan? Was He not baptized? Have you followed Him wherever He
   goes? If You have not done so, in being disobedient to His will you
   have lost a great privilege! There is His Supper, too. 'Tis but an
   outward form, as the other ordinance is. Both are but emblems, but
   still the Lord has been pleased to say, "This do in remembrance of Me,"
   and He often gives to His people very sweet manifestations of Himself
   in the breaking of bread. You are one of His disciples, or at least I
   suspect you are--but You have never been to the Lord's Table!

   "There are others that can observe those things," you say. Stop!
   Suppose it is right for any one Christian to neglect the ordinances of
   God's House? Clearly there can be no exceptional privileges--it would,
   therefore, be right for all Christians to neglect these two ordinances!
   You are not a member of any Christian Church, but you think you are
   right in standing alone. If you are, so would all be! And clearly, the
   visible Church would become extinct--but it could never have been the
   Lord's intention that it should be so! He has not ordained that His
   people should live as individuals alone. He calls Himself a Shepherd,
   because sheep are gregarious. They gather together and they make a
   flock in a fold, and He would have His people so. If He had called them
   by the name of some other creature, it might be supposed that they
   would go to Heaven separately and alone--but He calls them His flock
   and that signifies fellowship--union.

   If you are right, then we should all be right in doing as you do. And
   where and how could the means of Grace be maintained? Would not almost
   the very preaching of the Gospel become extinct? For the Church of God
   "is the pillar and ground of the Truth," by which is meant, I suppose,
   that, as in the Roman forum there were certain pillars upon which the
   decrees of the Senate were put up, so the Church is a pillar upon which
   God hangs up the Gospel--and its proclamation of the Gospel to the sons
   of men is the pillar and ground upon which God exhibits the Gospel to
   all onlookers. And truly it must be so. It is the Church's business to
   evangelize the world and to maintain Christ's ordinances. But where
   would the Church be to do this if all Christians were to be allowed to
   remain separate from the Church? Your business is to find some company
   of Believers, unite yourself with them and enjoy the privileges which
   Christ has given, such as His two ordinances of Baptism, and the Lord's
   Supper--and all the other blessings which belong to the Church as
   constituted in His name. "Are not you also one of His disciples?" His
   disciples meet to remember Him and some of you turn your backs! They
   gather around His Table and feed upon the bread and wine which are
   emblems of Him, but you go away and seem to say, "We do not need these
   emblems. Christ has instituted an ordinance which we do not require, we
   can do without it. We are so spiritual that we do not need it." O Sirs,
   say not so! If you are one of His disciples, do as He bids you!

   But now a more cheering thought with which to close. "Are not you also
   one of His disciples?" Then why are you not resting in His love, in His
   Grace and in Hispower? You came in here tonight with a burden upon your
   spirit which is crushing you into the very dust. You are low and
   depressed and miserable, and people in the house where you live know
   it--and yet they know that you are a professed Christian! "Are not you
   also one of His disciples?" and did not He say, "Behold the fowls of
   the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;
   yet your heavenly Father feeds them...Consider the lilies of the field,
   how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto
   you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
   these...Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? Or, What
   shall we drink?" You also are one of His disciples and yet you are
   vexing yourself with cares and troubles just like a heathen and a
   publican! Oh, but you have lost a friend, a child, a husband, or a
   father--and you are crushed into the very dust! You now have no hope
   and you are angry with your God--and yet Christ said, "Not as I will,
   but as You will." "Are not you also one of His disciples?" Is this like
   your Master? He drank the gall cup and you put it away and fight
   against your God!

   "But I am afraid of a trial that is coming upon me," you say. Yet Paul
   said, "Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and
   supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
   God." Your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these
   things! And you, one of His disciples, are fearing for the future? O
   Friend, O Friend, does this become you? Is this right? I have come,
   just now, from the bedside of a dearly-beloved friend to whom I have
   already referred. Strange as it is, he has been unconscious two days to
   everybody else, but the moment he hears my voice, he opens his eyes and
   says, "Oh, how happy I am to see your face once again, my dear pastor!"
   And then he begins to pour out a blessed torrent of adoration and
   praise to his God! Barely alive and yet he says he is the happiest man
   alive and Christ is more precious to him than ever! He is gently
   sinking away rejoicing. He says he is as happy as ever he was in his
   life and, he thinks, more happy, though the death-gurgle is in his
   throat and he can scarcely breathe.

   And you are afraid to die, are you? You are a disciple of that blessed
   Lord who is helping our dear Brother to die, but you think He will not
   help you, too? Why, thousands of His people have closed their eyes on
   earth, only to open them in Heaven! Thousands have died triumphantly!
   Thousands have passed through the River of Death calmly rejoicing in
   Jesus! And you also are one of the disciples of the same Master, the
   same Master who can--

   "Make a dying bed Feel soft as downy pillows are"-- the same Master who
   has said, "Fear you not, for I am with you: be not dismayed, for I am
   your God." Yet you cannot trust Him who has been so faithful to
   others--yes, and let me also say, who has been so faithful to you up
   till now! Oh, if you are, indeed, His disciple, go and put that aching
   head of yours right on the bosom of your Lord, for within that bosom
   palpitates a heart that never changes and that never fails one of His
   disciples! Go and rest there. You may rest, for it is well--it will be
   well with you for the present, for the future, for time, for eternity!
   If you are one of His disciples, take His yoke upon you and learn of
   Him! Like He, be meek and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest unto
   your soul. Remember that it is not your place to question what God
   does, nor to arraign Him at your bar. Your duty is not to say, "My will
   be done," but to remember that "it is enough for the disciple that he
   be as his Master, and the servant as his

   Lord."

   I trust the questions I have put to you, my Hearers, will not be lost
   upon you. It may strike you that it is not necessary to answer at once
   whether you are Christ's disciple or not, but it will be very necessary
   to answer that question soon. I have lately been struck beyond measure
   with the fact of our mortality and the suddenness with which many of
   our friends depart out of this world. I heard, only this last week,
   "Brother So-and-So walked into my shop on Thursday. On the Sunday I
   heard that he was dead." "Sister So-and-So was at the Communion
   service, and within 48 hours she died." This is the world of the dying!
   You seem to be passing before me in a procession and I, too, am part of
   the procession, myself! Oh, make sure work for eternity! Run no risk
   concerning your souls--not even this night's risk, for this night, at
   midnight, without a knock at your door there may come the messenger
   saying, "Prepare to meet your God." And

   then--and then, it willmatter if you are Christ's disciple, or not! It
   will notmatter, then, whether you have been rich or not, educated or
   not--but it will matter for all eternity whether you are His or not,
   for remember the division--"These shall go away into everlasting
   punishment; but the righteous into life eternal." God grant that you
   then may be with the company of the disciples of Jesus for Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN18:12-27.

   Verses 12, 13. Then the bandand the captain and officers of the Jews
   took Jesus and boundHim, andledHim away to Annas first; for he was
   father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that same year. [See
   Sermons #2820, Volume 49--

   CHRIST BEFORE ANNAS and #2822, Volume 49--CHRIST IN BONDS.] Annas had

   been high priest before, and he seems to have been still regarded as
   high priest and to have been a leading spirit among the adversaries of
   Christ. The old sinner would not go to bed that night until he had seen
   the Man whom he hated brought bound before him. Sometimes hatred
   becomes a more powerful passion than even love, and here, while the
   disciples of Jesus all fled in terror, Annas, the Savior's bitter foe,
   was wide awake and awaiting His arrival with those who had taken Him
   captive.

   14. Now Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
   expedient that one man should die for the people. Therein uttering a
   prophecy which he did not fully understand, speaking like another
   Balaam through whom God spoke His Truth, as once He did through the ass
   that Balaam rode! Sometimes God makes the basest men the unconscious
   utterers of His Truth which they do not, themselves, comprehend.

   15. And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Here
   is John's usual modesty--he will not mention his own name, but simply
   speaks of "another disciple."

   15, 16. That disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with
   Jesus into the palace of the high priest. But Peter stood at the door
   outside. John boldly followed Jesus and so was safe. Peter stood at a
   distance from his Lord and so was in danger.

   16-18. Then went out that other disciple who was known unto the high
   priest and spoke unto those whom kept the door and brought in Peter.
   Then said the damsel that kept the door, unto Peter, Are not you also
   one of this Man's disciples? He said, I am not. And the servants and
   officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals, for it was cold:
   and they warmed themselves; and Peter stood with them, and warmed
   himself Peter was in bad company. While he was warming his body, his
   soul was growing cold to his Master. Men cannot go into bad company
   without getting some hurt. It is said by a quaint old writer that if
   men go to Ethiopia, they may not become Ethiopians, but by the
   scorching of the sun they will grow blacker than they were before. It
   is always better to keep out of harm's way if we can. He that would not
   fall into a ditch should take care not to walk near the edge of it. So,
   if Peter wanted to stand fast, he should not have gone where he would
   be sure to be tempted.

   19. The high priest then asked Jesus of His disciples, and of His
   Doctrine. This was a sort of preliminary examination before the
   Sanhedrin should try Him officially.

   20-22. Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I taught in the
   synagogue and in the Temple, where the Jews always resort; and in
   secret have I said nothing. Why do you ask Me? Ask them who heard Me
   what I have said to them: behold they know what I said. And when He had
   thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the
   palm of his hand saying, Answer You the high priest so?Here we get an
   exposition of one of Christ's own sayings. You know that He said,
   "Whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other,
   also." Of course Christ would carry out His own precept, so we see that
   He did not mean that His disciples were literally to turn the other
   cheek to those who struck them, but that they were to bear such
   treatment patiently, and not to give a railing answer. See how Jesus
   Himself turned the other cheek.

   23. Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the
   evil: but if well, why do you strike Me?Nothing could have been more
   calm or more dignified and, at the same time, more full of the spirit
   of forgiveness.

   24-27. Now Annas had Him sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest. And
   Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Are
   not you also one of His disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
   One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear
   Peter cut off, said, Did not I see you in the garden with Him? [See
   Sermon

   #2106, Volume 35--"IN THE GARDEN WITH HIM".] Peter then denied

   again: and immediately the cock cre . We know that the Lord turned and
   looked upon Peter. He did not speak a word, perhaps lest Peter should
   fall into the hands of those who were round about him--but His look was
   sufficient to kindle in Peter the fires of repentance--and he went out
   to weep bitterly over his shameful denial of his Lord.

The Faithful Olive Tree

   (No. 3208)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 28, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 29,
   1879.

   "The trees once went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
   they said unto the olive tree, Reign over us. But the olive tree said
   to them, Should I cease giving my oil, wherewith by me they honor God
   and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?" Judges 9:8,9.

   HERE then, in parable, a temptation was set before the olive tree. It
   was urged to become ambitious and aspire to reign over the rest of the
   trees. We gather from Jotham's parable, at the outset, that we, also,
   are all liable to temptation. Though you may think yourself to be as
   firmly rooted and as useful as the olive tree, yet may the fascinating
   whisper be heard by you, "Come and reign over us," and though you
   should be as sweet and gentle as the fig tree, yet there may come to
   you the wily invitation, "Come and reign over us." And though you
   should be as fruitful as the vine, yet to you in the Lord's own
   vineyard there may come the serpent voice, "Come and reign over us." We
   shall never be out of the way of temptation so long as we grow in this
   earthly garden! Our Lord Himself had a stern conflict with the
   adversary at the commencement of His ministry, for He came up from the
   waters of Baptism to be tempted of the devil, and at the close of that
   ministry, "His sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling down
   to the ground" in the agony of His spirit when the powers of darkness
   assailed Him in Gethsemane. We must expect, in our measure, to be
   conformed to His likeness in this respect. The serpent will bruise our
   heel as well as our Lord's. Even into quiet like that of an olive
   garden, there will come the tempter and the temptation! It is not
   possible for us to be located anywhere in this world where our
   surroundings will be clear from danger, for if the serpent comes not
   into the olive groves, yet the other trees may tempt us. What,
   therefore, I say unto you, I say unto all, "Watch," for we are not
   ignorant of the devices of evil and those devices will surely be
   exercised upon us. Therefore let us cry unto the Strong for strength
   and set a double watch against the world, the flesh and the devil--

   "Christian! Seek not yet repose. Cast your dreams of ease away! You are
   in the midst of foes-- Watch and pray! Principalities andpowers
   Mustering their unseen array, Wait for your unguarded hours-- Watch and
   pray! Watch, as if on that alone Hung the issue of the day! Pray, that
   help may be sent down-- Watch and pray!"

   Temptations frequently come in the form of very pleasing baits. Satan
   gilds the pill that he offers us. He very seldom presents to any of us
   a bare hook, though that may be done with those who become habituated
   in sin. It is almost a bare hook when persons continue in drunkenness
   after they have ruined their health and brought themselves to beggars'
   rags. Satan hardly has to tempt them at all, for they go willingly
   after their idols and dote upon them. But with God's own people, Satan
   generally takes care to bait his hook and cover it so that it is
   scarcely seen.

   In this parable, the temptation to the olive tree is a throne, a crown,
   a kingdom, a sovereignty over the trees. The trees of the field said
   unto the olive tree, "Reign over us." Now there is always a sort of
   glitter about a kingdom. There are few persons who can resist the
   fascinations of a diadem. To reign over the trees might seem, even to
   the olive tree, to be a very strong temptation--a brilliant offer
   indeed! Take heed, dear Friends, lest you be carried away by the
   deceitful-ness of the pleasures, the profits, the honors which Satan
   puts in your way. When we are likely to be gainers by any proposal, we
   ought always to look well at it before deciding. When a day is too
   bright, we fear that it will finish with a thunderstorm--and when a
   man's prospects in life seem altogether extraordinary and excessive in
   their brilliance--he ought to pause awhile and see where he is going.
   We have always been taught that when there is very large interest to be
   had, there is something rotten about the security and very great risk
   to those who invest in it! And it is also so in all things. Whenever
   there comes to you, all of a sudden, some very alluring offer,
   something very grand and very unusual, like this request, "Reign over
   us," then doubly be on your guard, for it is after this fashion that
   Satan baits his hook and catches his fish! It is after this manner that
   he goes forth to hunt for his prey and many have been entangled in the
   meshes of a golden net who seemed in other ways to have escaped the
   corruptions of the world.

   Many, to obtain a higher wage, have left holy companionships and sacred
   opportunities for hearing the Word of God and growing in Grace. They
   have lost their Sabbaths, left a soul-feeding ministry and fallen among
   worldlings to their own sorrowful loss. Such persons are as foolish as
   the poor Indians who gave the Spaniards gold in exchange for paltry
   beads. Riches procured by impoverishing the soul are always a curse! To
   increase your business so that you cannot attend week-night services is
   to become really poorer--to give up heavenly pleasure--and receive
   earthly cares in exchange, is a sorry sort of barter!

   Let me call your attention to something rather singular about this
   parable. The trees represented in the parable were acting unwisely in
   desiring a king, for the trees which the Lord has planted need no king
   and He had not set a king over them. He makes them to be full of sap
   and waters them out of His treasure houses. And it is for the trees of
   the forest to sing before the Lord and to clap their hands in His name.
   Let the trees of the forest rejoice before Him that made them! But,
   according to this parable or fable, they conspired together to deliver
   themselves from the Theocracy--the government of God--and to come under
   the government of one of their own order. The trees desired a king and
   so fitly pictured that fond desire of the Israelite nation to have a
   king when God was their King and they had no need of any other king!
   They were constantly crying, "Make us like the nations that are round
   about us, and set a king over us." But this desire for a king was a
   wrong desire altogether.

   Yet notice that when the trees went to choose a king, they did it very
   wisely--their choice was an admirable one. They did not say to the
   spreading cedar, "Reign over us," nor to the pine with its odoriferous
   shade, "Reign over us." But they said to the fruitful olive,
   respectable in character and in every way a right royal tree, "Reign
   over us." And when they were disappointed of the first election, they
   went to another worthy tree, the fig, and said to it, "Come and reign
   over us." Then they went to the vine--that fruitful tree--and said to
   it, "Come and reign over us." And they only went to the bramble when
   they were hard pushed and feared that none of the trees would accept
   the candidature for royalty. They made a good choice at first and I
   have noticed that even when men are themselves bad and foolish, they
   generally have sense enough left to pick out somebody better than
   themselves to be the instrument of their designs. How frequently have I
   seen an ungodly man act thus when looking for a wife! She must be a
   Christian--he has sense enough to see her sterling worth, her solid
   character, her meekness and her gentleness--so he wants her as his
   wife. Often have I known that a man in business, albeit he despised
   religion, has wanted to have his confidential servant not simply a
   professor, but really a possessor of the Grace of God!

   This is one of the dangers to which Christian people are exposed. It is
   not because you are a bramble that you will be the first to be tempted
   to reign over the trees. They will not want the bramble just yet--they
   will come to that as the fourth in the list. But if you are the good
   olive tree, they will want you first. They will want you for a bad
   purpose because there is something about you that will make their
   purpose look respectable--and so you will serve their purposes. They
   will not care for the best part of you, that part for which your Lord
   cares most. That part they will openly despise and trample on one day,
   but just now, that is the charm to them and they say to the olive tree,
   "Come and reign over us." Be on your guard! Some of our bankrupt
   companies would not have taken so many people in if they had not the
   names of certain men of repute as directors. Their power for evil dies
   there. We must have a king, contrary to God's will, so we

   must try to get the olive tree to reign over us if we possibly can so
   as to make our new kingdom seem respectable. O Believers, be on the
   watch! Take heed unto yourselves lest you enter into unholy alliances,
   or put yourselves into positions out of which you may be unable to
   escape, but may have to mourn to your dying day that you ever entered
   into that evil confederacy! You must say, "Our Master bids us come out
   from the world and be separate from sinners. He bids Christians walk
   with Him and be choice in their company, and not be unequally yoked
   together with unbelievers, for that would be dishonoring to God and
   ruinous to their souls!"

   You see, therefore, that this parable of Jotham can afford instruction
   to us and I ask the Lord, while I further open it up, to give me the
   right words to all to whom it applies.

   I. My first head is this--APPARENT PROMOTIONS ARE NOT TO BE SNATCHED AT
   HURRIEDLY.

   "The trees once went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
   they said unto the olive tree, Reign over us. But"--there is a pause
   there. It was all very well for them to say to the olive tree, "Reign
   over us. Come at once. Do not give it a second thought. Come along. You
   never had such a fine opportunity as this. Here is a brilliant opening
   for you. Come and reign over us." "But the olive tree said to them,
   Should I cease giving my oil, wherewith by me they honor God and man,
   and go to be promoted over the trees?" Notice how the olive tree
   speaks. It says, "Should I? You say, 'Come along,' but I answer, Should
   I? This is a matter that needs consideration. Ought it to be so? Would
   it be right? Is it wise? Is it prudent? Is it just? Is it God's will?
   Should I"

   I speak to younger and old this word of caution. Be not in a hurry to
   make changes! Hasten not to run into evil thinking it to be good, but
   always look before you leap. Stop a while and ask, "Should I? Should I
   do this or that?" I meet constantly with persons who are in terrible
   trouble and who I know came into that trouble and will probably remain
   in that trouble for years--perhaps all their lives--because they once,
   unthinkingly, did an act which they ought not to have done if they had
   only paused, then, and asked, as the olive tree did, "Should I? Should
   I? Should I?" A few minutes spent in serious consideration and
   especially in prayerful waiting upon God would have kept their pathway
   smooth and themselves in peace. You have almost done a certain deed,
   but I beseech you to pull up, now, and stop a minute, and say to
   yourself, "Should I do it?"

   I will throw the emphasis on the letter I. The olive tree said, "Should
   I Should I I am not a bramble. The bramble may be king of the trees if
   he likes. It may be a question which the fig tree, or the cedar, or the
   vine, or the oak might entertain, but should I Should Icease giving my
   oil and go to be promoted over the trees? Should Ido this?" Now, there
   are a thousand things which may be right in worldlings which are wrong
   in Christians. There is a very high law for all men and I will not
   depreciate the true standard of common morality, but set it as high as
   it can be set! But over and above that there is a law of
   consecration--there is a rule, not merely of morality, but of something
   more--of holiness. There is a law of disinterestedness which is binding
   upon a Christian, which imposes upon him a restraint that causes him
   often to say, "I might do this if I were other than I am. But, being
   what I am, I cannot do it." When Nehemiah was governor of Judah, he had
   a right to take his daily portion. It was the proper provision for the
   governor's support, and all the previous governors had taken it. But
   Nehemiah said, "So I did not because of the fear of God." It would have
   been quite right for Nehemiah to take it, but he would not take it
   because there was something still better which led him to say, "God
   will be somewhat compromised if I do this. These people are poor, so I
   will not impose a tax upon them. I will not take that which is lawfully
   mine." "All things," said Paul, "are lawful to me, but all things are
   not expedient." And often, out of that blessed rule of loving
   expediency for the good of others and the glory of God, we may be made
   to keep back from things which we would allow in others but cannot
   allow in ourselves. I invite any dear Christian friend here who may be
   asked to take an important step--concerning which, if he were to
   consult a friend, he would certainly say, "Oh yes, that is a fine thing
   for you! Do it," to put to himself the question, "Will it be, all
   round, the best thing that I can do for the glory of God? Should I
   Should I do this?"

   Sir Edward Cole, Chief Justice of England in the time of James I, was a
   man of noble spirit and often incurred the displeasure of the king by
   his patriotism. On one occasion when an unworthy attempt was made to
   influence his conduct, he replied, "When the case happens, I shall do
   that which shall be fit for a judge to do." Oh, that all Christians, in
   trying moments, would act as shall be fit for followers of Christ to
   do!

   Sometimes the new course of life that may be proposed to us may seem
   very desirable. It was not a small thing for the olive tree to be asked
   to be king over the trees, to lord it over all the forests, to have
   loyal homage from oak, cedar and all the fruitful trees. It did seem an
   exceedingly desirable thing, yet the olive tree said, "Should I cease
   giving my oil, and go to be promoted over the trees?" So, dear Friend,
   be not deceived by the glitter of prosperity, nor moved away from the
   steadfastness of your faith and your love to Christ by the appearance
   of something which looks to you exceedingly advantageous! First stop
   where you are and ask yourself, "Should I?" For there is this fact to
   be considered. If this olive tree had taken the kingdom, it would have
   involved many cares and troubles. In the original, the word runs as
   though it might be translated thus, "Should I leave my oil to go up and
   down among the trees?" You know that a king, when he takes a kingdom,
   has much work to do. He has to watch over his subjects and to visit
   different parts of his dominions. He cannot keep still and be quiet. So
   this olive tree says, "I have stood here for centuries, and many have
   enjoyed my oil, but if I become a king, I must go up and down among the
   trees." So, I ask you, whenever you have an opening in Providence to
   rise in the world--to consider the duties that will be involved in it
   rather than the profits that will come of it-- because it is selfish to
   say, "Oh, yes! I would like the emoluments," but it is righteous to
   ask, "Am I equal to the duties? Can I perform them? Can I expect to be
   enabled to discharge them as a Christian should do in the sight of
   God?" For the very best work of every sort ought always to come from us
   Christians. A Christian servant should be the best of all servants. A
   Christian artist should try to have the clearest eye and the deftest
   hand. Whatever is done by those of us who are Christians, we ought to
   do as unto the Lord and I am sure that we ought not to do anything in a
   second-rate way "unto the Lord." Up to the utmost of our ability, we
   should do our very best for Him. Well then, if there is an opening set
   before you, look not so much at the glitter of it, but, like this olive
   tree, look at the work of it, look at the duty attached to it and ask,
   "Can I do it? Am I equal to it?" Do not occupy the position unless you
   have a reasonable expectation of filling it well and performing its
   duties acceptably.

   Then remember that every time a man moves, he gets fresh cares, fresh
   temptations, fresh troubles. I somewhat admire the principle of the
   coachmen I have seen in Switzerland when the flies settle on their
   horses and suck their blood. I have been very anxious to knock the
   creatures off, but the men have said to me, "You had better not do so,
   for if you kill those flies, there will be some fresh ones come that
   will be greedier and suck more." So, when you have a set of troubles,
   you had better let them stay, for if you get rid of them, you may get
   others that will be worse! My burden that I have to carry, I would be
   glad to be rid of--yet I should not like to take yours, my Sister, nor
   yours, my Brother, because I do not know where your load might chafe my
   shoulders. I know where mine galls me, when it galls at all, and I can
   carry my own burden better than anybody else's burden. So I am content
   to keep it and I think you should be content to keep yours. By Divine
   Grace, you have been excellent as a servant, but how would you be as a
   mistress? Yes, you have been a very good employee--you have done your
   work very well--but, as a master you might be a complete failure. Look
   well at the thing, turn it around all ways. Many a man has done
   exceedingly well in one sphere of life, but has not done so well in
   another sphere. Solomon truly says, "As a bird that wanders from her
   nest, so is a man that wanders from his place." There is a niche in
   which each statue stands and you see its proportions, for the niche was
   prepared for the statue, and the statue for the niche. But if you set
   it up higher, it loses its due proportions. It is seen from another
   point of view and its beauty is gone. Let us, therefore, whenever there
   is something new set before us as a great attraction, stop and ask,
   "Should I take it?"--adding this one to all our other reflections--that
   wherever we may go, we shall have a change of trouble and care--but we
   shall still have trouble and care.

   The most weighty consideration in connection with the question, "Should
   I?" is this--"Can I expect the Divine blessing on what I am about to
   dol Dare I venture to lay this case before the Lord in all its
   details?" I know some of you who are quite willing to bring a case to
   your minister for his advice. And sometimes he sees, by the very look
   of your face, that your coming to him is all a sham! You had made up
   your mind before you came and you only needed him to say, "Yes," to
   your, "Yes," so as to have some kind of sanction in doing something
   about which your conscience is not quite easy. Has it not been so? And
   sometimes in your family, when you have needed counsel, have you not
   stayed away from the one person who would have honestly told you the
   truth? You have thought like Ahab, "There is one Prophet of the Lord in
   Israel, but he always speaks evil and not good of me. Let all the
   prophets speak except Micah--I do not want to hear him. He does not
   ever seem to soften his message, but he lets out the plain blunt truth,
   so I won't go to him." It is not wise, dear Christian Friends, if you
   talk as that wicked king did! If you are about to change your state of
   life, or your position in anyway whatever, let the change be such that
   you can look at it yourself from top to bottom, and can invite
   Christian friends to look at it most carefully and yet say of it, "It
   is good." Let it be such that you can look at it on a dy-

   ing bed, in the light of eternity, and say, "In this thing I really
   sought to glorify God." If not--it will be better by far to say, with
   the olive tree, "Should I? Should I?" and to come to the olive's
   decision, "I will do nothing of the kind. Any tree that likes may have
   the crown--it is not for me."

   II. Now, secondly, ACTUAL ADVANTAGES ARE NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH, for
   the olive says, "Should I

   cease giving my oil and go to be promoted over the trees?"

   The greatest advantage in life is to be useful to God and man. The
   olive says, "Should I cease giving my oil, wherewith by me they honor
   God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?" It was the olive's
   glory that it yielded oil which was used in various offerings to the
   honor of God and which was also used for the honor of men in the most
   sacred ceremonies at the anointing of kings and priests. And the
   highest glory of any man's life is that he is honorable to God and
   useful to men. The first considerations of a saved soul should be, "How
   can I best magnify Him who has saved me? How can I be most useful to my
   fellow men in promoting the cause of the Lord Jesus Christ?" Anything,
   then, which robs us of that desire--the power to honor God and to do
   good to men--anything which takes away in even the smallest degree our
   power to do this, is a dead loss! If the olive tree shall be made king
   over the trees, but lose its oil whereby it honors God and man, the
   olive tree is a loser. So if, by changing from a cottage to a palace,
   yes, and from a prison to a throne, the believer in Christ would lose
   any atom of his power to serve God and bless the sons of men, he would
   be a loser thereby! We must always hold this before us as a test when
   an offer comes to us--will it really be for the glory of God and the
   good ofmen?

   Sometime I think, beloved Brothers and Sisters, it is our sense of
   having that oil of Divine Grace--by which we honor God and help
   men--which makes temptation powerless, for in the Hebrew, the text runs
   thus, "Have I then lost my oil that I should go to be promoted over the
   trees?" So may you say to yourself, "Have I then lost my joy in Christ,
   or lost my peace of mind, or lost the blessed privilege of glorifying
   God that I should go and look after this world's gain or this world's
   honors? If I had not Christ as my Savior--if I had not love to Him in
   my heart--if I had not the love of God shed abroad in my soul, this or
   that might, indeed, be a temptation to me. But as I have not lost those
   great blessings, you tempt me with a bait that has no fascination for
   me, for I have something better--

   "Go, you that boast of all your stores

   And tell how bright they shine!

   Your heaps of glittering dust are yours,

   But my Redeemer's mine"--

   "and while He is mine, I cannot leave Him--not even to be promoted over
   my fellow men, nor to roll in wealth, for He is infinitely superior to
   any bait or bribe which you can present to me!"--

   "Begone, unworthy of my cares,

   You specious baits of sense!

   Inestimable worth appears,

   The pearl of price immense!"

   Let the joy of the Lord, dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, be your
   protection against temptation. I feel persuaded that when you have full
   assurance of faith and your heart is filled with joy in Christ, you are
   able to repel the fiery darts of the enemy, for if he comes and offers
   you gold, you can say to him, "I have diamonds and pearls that are
   worth far more than all your gold." "I offer you honor," he says, but
   you reply, "I have the love of Christ, which is my greatest honor. Is
   it not written, 'Unto you who believe He is an honor'? That honor which
   I derive from Him is greater than any honor which you can give me."
   Thus you checkmate your great adversary! You can prove to him that in
   Christ you possess far more than he can possibly offer to you--

   "Jesus, to multitudes unknown,

   Oh name Divinely sweet!

   Jesus in You, in You alone,

   Health, honor, pleasure, meet!

   Should both the Indies at my call,

   Their boasted stores resign,

   With joy I would renounce them all,

   For leave to call You mine.

   Should earth's vain treasures all depart, Of this dear gift possessed,
   I'd clasp it to my joyful heart, And be forever blessed!"

   Oh, that our hearts may be kept in this blessed condition! So shall
   temptation be powerless to overcome us.

   To help you in this matter, let me remind you of two or three things on
   which you may reflect with profit.

   First, Beloved, suppose it should be your prospect in life that from
   this day forward you should not be as useful as you now are but that
   you should be much better off? Suppose it were proposed to you that you
   should not glorify God as you have done in the past, but that you
   should be much more respectable? Suppose it were laid upon you as an
   obligation that from this time forward you should not do half the good
   you have done in the past, but that you should receive a title of
   nobility and move in a higher circle of society than you have ever
   done? Would not these proposals startle you? If you are a true
   Christian, I know they would! You would say, with the olive tree,
   "Shall I cease giving my oil, wherewith by me they honor God and man,
   and go to be promoted over the trees?" You would instantly recoil from
   such a prospect when it was set before you and you would say, "No, let
   me be as a servant of Christ wherever I can serve my Master best. And
   let me be kept where I can bring most glory to His holy name."

   If this prospect startles you, let me invite you to consider what the
   retrospect would be. Suppose that lying on a dying bed, you, as a child
   of God, should have to say, "I was very happy and very useful during
   the first part of my life, but I took a step which apparently promised
   me comfort--and ever afterwards there was a blight upon my whole life.
   God never again favored me by making me useful in His service. I did
   little or nothing for Him and now I have come to the end of my life
   like a withered fruitless vine-branch." Do you not think that even with
   a faint hope of Heaven to sustain you, your dying pillow would be
   stuffed with thorns? I am sure it would be a far more joyous experience
   to lie there waiting to be translated and feeling, with Paul, "I have
   fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
   henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness." Do not,
   therefore, O olive tree or Christian, be tempted to turn aside to gain
   a fading crown, but stay where you are and enjoy the joy which Divine
   Grace gives you, whereby you shall honor God and be a blessing to men!

   I will also venture to say that, if a Christian were to leave the
   enjoyment of communion with Christ and usefulness among his fellows
   even for a day, to be through that day made into a king, it would be a
   day that he would ever afterwards wish to have crossed out of his
   diary. A day without Christ, who is my life? Without His love for a
   day? Without His smile for a day? Let the day perish wherein such a
   calamity could happen! What if the thrones of all the Caesars could be
   occupied for that one day by a chaste heart that loves Jesus? It would
   be a wretched heart and it would say, "I had better be in a prison and
   find my Lord there and live in His love, rather than be exalted here to
   sit upon a throne without Him." Now if it would be so sad for a single
   day, what would it be if you could make such a choice as that for the
   whole of your life?

   Ah, Beloved, and let me add that when any do choose worldly gain and
   worldly honor and let their usefulness suffer in consequence, it is
   almost certain to end in disappointment Not if they are hypocrites, for
   they will probably get what they seek after. They mostly prosper in
   this world and increase in riches when they give up their profession
   for it, but if you are a child of God and you get out of God's way, the
   hand of the Lord will be lifted up against you. As surely as you are
   God's children, you will be driven back to Him--He will fetch you home
   with a rod behind you. You shall not prosper if you err from His ways.
   Look at Lot. He pitches his tent toward Sodom because he sees that the
   well-watered plain of Jordan is just the place for his flocks and
   herds. Then he lives in Sodom because it is so comfortable to live in a
   town and give up living in tents and wandering about as Abraham does.
   But did he make a good thing of it in the long run? Ah, let the flames
   that devoured his house and the brine that turned his wife into a
   pillar of salt, and the horrible sin that depraved both him and his
   daughters tell that it is an awful thing for a child of God to get away
   from God! But if he walks with God, it shall be well with him. The
   Philistines could not hurt Abraham, neither could famine come near his
   tents--but every evil thing came to Lot when he gave up the separated
   life and began to live like the rest of the world! Then, dear Christian
   Friends, when the greatest honor or gain is offered to you, say with
   the faithful olive tree, "Should I cease giving my oil, wherewith by me
   they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"--

   "I would not change my blest estate

   For all that earth calls good or great!

   And while my faith can keep her hold, I envy not the sinner's gold."

   Do not forget that it was only the bramble that accepted that proffered
   crown. He had nothing to lose, so he was glad to take it. Now, if
   anybody goes to the races, frequents the theater and enjoys all the
   gaieties and frivolities of this world, I do not find fault with
   him--why should I do so? Whenever I see hogs greedily devouring their
   slop, I say, Let them enjoy it--it suits them, it is their sort of
   food." But if I saw a child of God doing what the ungodly do, I should
   feel just as if I saw one of you going to the swine trough and kneeling
   down there to find your food! Of course it was a fine thing for the
   bramble to be made into a king over the trees. He had always been
   hidden away, despised and hated, but now that he was made king, he
   could lord it over the rest of the trees. He could pierce them with his
   thorns and the flames could burn up his foes. But the bramble's
   position would not suit the olive tree, or the vine, or the fir tree!
   And, dear Christian Friend, can you be content with that which
   satisfies the very meanest of men--those who are dead in trespasses and
   sins? I trust you cannot. Rather aspire to follow in the footsteps of
   the saints who flung away this world that they might gain the next!
   Think of the martyrs who counted not their lives dear to them, that
   they might win Christ and be found in Him. Their persecutors offered
   them wealth. They offered them position and power! They offered them
   what was still dearer--that they should live in peace and enjoy the
   love of wife and children--and as the alternative, they must stand at
   the stake and be burnt to death! They did not hesitate to choose the
   dread alternative, for they could die for Christ, but they could not
   deny Him! They could be burnt to death, but they could not violate
   their conscience! They could not leave their oil, wherewith they
   honored God and blessed man, for anything that their persecutors could
   offer them.

   Remember, also, how your Master and Lord acted. All the kingdoms of
   this world lie at His feet and the arch-fiend says to Him, "All these
   things will I give You if you will fall down and worship me." And His
   reply is, "Get you hence, Satan." He may have life, liberty, power and
   an earthly kingdom if He will but speak before Pilate, or will but
   command the eager crowds to make Him king, but He remains silent and He
   dies. He saved others, Himself He will not save because His heart is
   set upon our salvation. So, Beloved, often deny yourselves what you
   might have--what might lawfully be yours. Put away every alluring bait
   if in any wise you would injure your usefulness or mar your character
   by taking it. The Lord help you to do this by His good Spirit!

   III. My time has almost gone, so I can only give you the third division
   in outline. It is this--TEMPTATION SHOULD BE TURNED TO ACCOUNT.

   First, let us take deeper root. The mere proposal to leave our oil
   should make us hold the faster to it.

   Next, let us be on the watch that we lose not our joy, which is our
   oil. If we would not leave it, neither can we bear that it should leave
   us.

   Then let us yield more oil and bear more fruit. He who gains largely is
   all the further removed from loss. The more we increase in Divine
   Grace, the less we are likely to leave it.

   Lastly, let us feel the more content and speak the more lovingly of our
   gracious state, that none may dare to entice us. When Satan sees us
   happily established, he will have the less hope of overthrowing us.

   I have been preaching some practical Truths of God which may not be
   quite as sweet to you as if I were preaching the precious Doctrines of
   the Gospel, but these Truths are needed for the strengthening of the
   soul in times of trial. I pray the Lord to help you to be strong in Him
   and to stand fast in the faith. Do not go away from the Truths of God
   that make you spiritually fat and flourishing. Do not turn aside from
   the Christ who makes you strong. Do not depart from the fellowship with
   Him that makes you holy and useful. Abound in prayer, abide in
   communion with Christ and let not the prospect of the most glittering
   life tempt you to turn away even an inch from your Lord and Master, but
   may His Divine Spirit keep you true to Him throughout the whole of your
   life--and to Him shall be the praise and glory forever and ever! Amen.

The Priceless Prize

   (No. 3209)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 4, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "That I may win Christ." Philippians 3:8.

   THE very high value that the Apostle Paul set upon the Savior is most
   palpable when he speaks of winning Him. This shows that the Savior held
   the same place in Paul's esteem as the crown did in the esteem of the
   runner at the Olympic games. To gain that crown, the competitor
   strained every nerve and sinew, feeling as though he were content to
   drop down dead at the goal if he might but win it. Paul felt that were
   he to run with all his might, if that were the way of winning
   Christ--were he to strain soul and body to win Him, He would be well
   worth the effort. He shows his value of Christ by speaking of Him as
   the prize he panted to win. He uses the very same words which the
   soldier would use concerning the victory when, with garments rolled in
   blood, amidst confused noise and clouds of smoke, he counts all things
   but little if he may but hear the shout of triumph. So, Paul, regarding
   Christ as more glorious and excellent than mountains of prey,
   considered such a prize to be worth all the fighting, even though he
   should agonize and sweat with blood! He would be well worth dying to
   win. I take it that he speaks of Christ here as though he felt that He
   was the very climax of his desire, the summit of his ambition. If he
   might but get Christ, he would be perfectly satisfied--but if he could
   not get Him--whatever else he might have, he would still remain
   unblessed.

   I would to God that you all felt the same. I wish that the ambition of
   every one of my fellow creatures here assem-bled--and, indeed, the wide
   world over--were this, that they might win Christ! Oh, if they did but
   know His precious-ness, if they did but understand how happy and how
   blessed He makes those to be who gain Him, they, too, would give up
   everything else for this one desire--that they may win Christ! I hope
   that, perhaps, a few words of mine may be blessed of God the Spirit to
   stir up such a desire in the hearts of the congregation now assembled.
   How, then, shall I begin?

   I. WHILE YOU HAVE NOT CHRIST, YOU ARE IN A VERY BAD CONDITION--SHOULD
   NOT THIS MAKE YOU LONG FOR HIM?

   Consider, my dear Hearer, you who are Christless tonight, what you are
   and where you are. You are a sinner--that you know. Without Christ you
   are an unpardoned sinner, a condemned sinner and, before long you will
   be a sinner judged, sentenced and cast into Hell! Do you not know that?
   You are a diseased sinner. Sin is the leprosy which is in you and,
   without Christ, you are sick without a physician. For you there is no
   balm in Gilead, no physician there. Your sickness is mortal! It will
   certainly be your ruin, for you have no Savior. You are a mortal--you
   cannot doubt it. You will soon die and can you tell what it will be to
   die without Christ? Have you ever formed an idea of what it will be to
   pass into the realm of separate spirits with no rod to lean on and no
   staff to comfort you in the dark valley? Man, you are an immortalbeing!
   You know that, too! You will not cease to be when you die. You will
   live again--and what will it be to live again without Christ? It will
   be to live the life of a condemned spirit, withered by the wrath of
   God, scathed by the lightning of Divine Justice! Can you think of that
   without dismay?--

   "Sinner, is your heart at rest?

   Is your bosom void of fear?

   Are you not by guilt oppressed?

   Speaks not conscience in your ear?

   Can this world afford you bliss?

   Can it chase away your gloom?

   Flattering, false, and vain it is-- Tremble at the worldling's doom!"

   Why, even now, I think I can see you. You are like the ship upon the
   lake of Gennesaret, tempest-tossed. The winds howl about her, every
   timber creaks, the sail is torn to pieces and the mast is going by the
   board! And for you there is no Savior to come and walk the billows, and
   to say, "It is I, be not afraid!" At the helm of your ship there sleeps
   no Savior who can arise and say to the waves, "Peace, be still!" You
   are a ship in a storm, with none to rescue you, seeing that you have no
   Savior. The devil has scuttled you. There are holes bored through and
   through your spirit's hope and confi-dence--and it will go down, before
   long, in depths of unutterable woe!

   I think I see you again. You are like Lazarus in the grave, and by this
   time you are foul and noxious, for you have been dead these 30 or 40
   years and that death has festered into putrid corruption. Yes, there
   you are, and you have no Christ to say, "Roll away the stone." You have
   no Christ to say, "Lazarus, come forth!" No Savior to bid your friends
   loosen you and let you go! I think I see you yet again. You have been
   singing of the dying thief. We often sing of him. And you will die as
   the thief died, only--only there will be no Christ hanging on the Cross
   from whom you shall hear the words--"This day shall you be with Me in
   Paradise."

   Unto what shall I liken you and with what shall I compare you? A soul
   without Christ! Why, it were better for you that you had never been
   born if you continue so! You would be better off with the millstone
   about your neck and cast into the sea, if that would make an end of
   you! You would be far happier, then, than you now are without Christ,
   for without Christ you are without God and without hope in the world!
   You are a sheep lost on the mountains and no Shepherd to find you--a
   soul wandering in the blackness of darkness, and no lamp to guide your
   wandering footsteps! And soon you will be a desolate spirit, without a
   ray of comfort, without a home, shut out in the blackness of darkness
   forever! Does not that make you long for Christ? It would if I could
   make you feel what I can only say! I can only deal with your outward
   ears--my Master must deal with your hearts--and I do pray Him, by His
   Almighty Spirit, to make you feel so wretched without Christ that you
   will not dare to sleep tonight until you have sought Him, laid hold
   upon Him and said to Him, "I will not let You go, except You bless me."

   O you souls out of Christ, I could, with half a moment's thought, stop
   and burst into tears and say no more! But I must command myself, for I
   must speak to you--and I do pray you, by the living God, unless you are
   beside yourselves, if you have any love to your own souls, fly to
   Christ! Seek the Lord! Try to lay hold upon Him, for as you now are,
   your position is perilous in the extreme!--

   "Come, guilty souls, and flee away Like doves to Jesus' wounds! This is
   the welcome Gospel-Day, Wherein Free Grace abounds! God loved the
   Church and gave His Son To drink the cup of wrath. And Jesus says He'll
   cast out none That come to Him by faith."

   II. We will now change the strain, but not the objective. Remember that
   ALL THE THINGS IN THE WORLD

   ARE VAIN WITHOUT CHRIST.

   The world's goods, its substance, its riches, its pleasures, its pomp,
   its fame--what are all these without Christ? They are a painted
   pageantry to go to Hell in! They are a mockery to an immortal spirit!
   They are a mirage of the wilderness, deluding the traveler, but not
   yielding to his desires one substantial drop of joy! There have been
   those in this world who have tried it, and they say, "It sounds, it
   sounds, it sounds, because it is empty and hollow as a drum." It is--

   "False as the smooth, deceitful sea, And empty as the whistling wind."

   There is nothing in it all--

   "Honor's a puff of noisy breath, And gain a heap of yellow clay."

   And what is even power itself, but anxiety and care? Solomon knew the
   world at its best and his verdict upon her was, "Vanity of vanities,
   says the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity." Without Christ,
   Sinner, you will find the world

   to be unsatisfactory. When you have tried it at its best, you will turn
   from it and say, "I have been deceived! I have eaten the wind and I am
   not satisfied. I am like one that feasts in a dream, and wakes and,
   lo--he is hungry!" Without Christ you will not even find this world to
   be comfortable. Perhaps there are none so unhappy as those who are
   surrounded with what we think to be the means of happiness. I know
   this--if I had to find the extreme of wretchedness, I should not go to
   the dens of poverty, but I should go among men surrounded with the
   trappings of wealth and find you hearts broken with anguish and spirits
   wrung with griefs which they could not tell! Oh, yes, the world is a
   heap of chaff! The only solid treasure is to be found in Christ! But if
   you neglect Him, you neglect all that is worth having!

   Besides, all this world must soon pass away. See how it melts! Or, if
   it melts not from you, you must melt from it. Down goes the ship! She
   floated gaily but an hour before, but she foundered and she is gone!
   And now, merchant, what will you do? Your vessel has gone down with all
   your treasure on board and you are left penniless! Oh, happy are they
   who lay up their treasure in Christ, for no shipwreck need they fear!
   But, oh!--

   "This world's a dream, an empty show"-- which cannot satisfy an
   immortal soul!

   Further than this, let me remind you, my dear Hearer, that if you have
   not Christ, nothing else will be of use for you. A profession of
   religion will only be a sort of respectable pall to throw over the
   corpse of your dead soul! No, a profession of religion, if you have not
   Christ in it, will be a swift witness against you to condemn you! What
   right have you to profess to be a follower of Christ unless Christ is,
   in you, the hope of Glory? And to have listened to the ministry of the
   Word will be of no use to you if you do not get Christ. Alas, alas,
   what can our poor sermons do? Our prayers, our hymns--what are they?
   Ah, and what will your Baptism be--and what will the Lord's Supper be
   unless by faith you grasp a Savior? These ordinances, though ordained
   by God, Himself, are wells without water and clouds without rain unless
   they get us Christ, who is the sum and substance of them all! It will
   be of no use to you that you were regular in your private prayers, that
   you were good to the poor, that you were generous to the Church, that
   you were constantly in attendance upon the outward means of Grace. I
   say, as I said before, that all these are but a painted pageantry for
   your soul to go to Hell in, unless you have Christ! You may as surely
   go down to the Pit by the religious road as by the irreligious. If you
   have not Christ, you have not salvation, whatever else you may have--

   "Give me Christ, or else I die"-- should be your daily and nightly
   prayer, for all else will destroy you if you have not the Savior!

   And let me tell you, dear Hearer, that your repentance, if it does not
   lead you to Christ, will need to be repented of! And your faith, if it
   is not based upon His atoning Sacrifice, is a faith that is not the
   faith of God's elect! And all your convictions of sin--all the visions
   that have scared you, all the fears that have haunted you--will only be
   a prelude to something worse unless you get Christ! There is one door
   and if you go not through that, climbing up some other way, though it
   is never so tedious, will not answer your turn. You must go down to
   Hell after all your efforts, all your repent-ings, all your believing,
   unless your soul can say--

   "My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness!
   I dare not trust the sweetest frame, But wholly lean on Jesus'name-- On
   Christ, the solid Rock, I stand, All other ground is sinking sand!" Oh,
   how this ought to make you long for Christ, when you think that
   everything else is but a bauble when compared with Him! And think what
   a state you are in as long as you are destitute of Him!

   III. I must not tarry, so let me remind you, my dear Hearer, though you
   cannot possibly know how anxious I am to speak so that you may feel
   what I say, that NOTHING CAN MAKE AMENDS TO YOU FOR LOSING CHRIST.

   I know how it is with some of you. You say you cannot afford to follow
   Christ. Your trade--your wicked trade-- you would have to give that up,
   for it happens to be an ungodly calling. Well now, Friend, let me take
   you by the button-hole a minute. Which had you better be--a beggar and
   go to Heaven, or a duke--and go to Hell? Come, now, which had you
   better do--go to Heaven with an empty pocket or go down to the Pit with
   a full one? All you who worship Mammon, I know how you will answer, but
   you who have souls above earth, I hope you will reply, "Nothing in the

   form of wealth will compensate us for losing our souls." Men have been
   known, on their dying beds, to have their moneybags brought to
   them--and they have put them to their hearts and have said, "This won't
   do," and they have taken up another and put it to their palpitating
   hearts, and said again, "This won't do." Ah, no, it cannot cure a
   heartache! What can it do for a soul in eternity? Is it not a painful
   thing to attend upon some men who die rich in ill-gotten gain? What are
   they the better for their wealth? They only have it said of them, "He
   died worth so much." That is all, but they sleep in the same earth and
   the same worms devour them! There is more fighting over their graves
   among the heirs who divide the plunder andmore joy because they are
   gone! While oftentimes the poor man has the honest tears of his
   children shed upon a coffin which they have had to contribute to
   purchase out of their little savings and the grave, itself, has been
   prepared by the charity of some who found in their father's character
   the only patrimony which he had to bequeath. Oh, may God grant you
   Grace to perceive that all the riches you can ever get would never make
   up for losing Christ!

   Some lose Christ for the sake of fame. It is not a fashionable thing to
   be a Christian. To be a Christian after the world's sort, I grant
   you--is but after the sort of the New Testament, it is not! And many
   say, "Well, it is not fashionable," and they bend to the fashion. And
   many do the same in another way, for young men are laughed out of going
   to the House of God and young women are decoyed from attending the
   means of Grace by the laughter, jeers and jokes of their companions.
   Remember that they can laugh you into Hell, but they can never laugh
   you out again! And that though their jokes may shut the door, their
   jokes can never open that door again. Oh, is this all? Will you sell
   your souls to escape from a fool's laughter? Then, what a fool you must
   be! What? Are you so thin-skinned that you cannot bear to be
   questioned, or to be asked whether you are a follower of the Lord
   Jesus? Ah, Sir, you shall have that thin skin of yours tormented more
   than enough in the world to come, when shame, which you dread so much,
   shall be your everlasting portion! O Soul, how can you sell Christ for
   the applause of men? How can you give Him up for the laughter of fools?

   Some give Jesus Christ up for the pleasures of the world, but can the
   giddy dance for a few minutes of this life be worth the torments of the
   world to come? Oh, weigh, like wise men--as merchants weigh their goods
   against the gold-- I pray you, weigh your souls against the pleasures
   of this world! Oh, where is the pleasure? Even Tiberius, in his desert
   island, when he had ransacked the world to find a new joy, could not,
   if he could give us all the mirth he knew, tell us of anything that
   would be worth the casting away of the soul! This pearl is too
   priceless for the world to attempt to purchase! I pray you, be wise
   enough to feel that nothing can compensate you for this loss! Seek
   Jesus and may you find Him tonight!

   IV. A fourth observation upon which I shall not enlarge, is
   this--DEPEND UPON IT, THAT WHATEVER YOU

   LOSE FOR CHRIST'S SAKE WILL BE A BLESSED LOSS FOR YOU!

   Gregory Nazianzen, a foremost father of the Christian Church, rejoiced
   that he was well versed in the Athenian phi-losophy--and why do you
   think he rejoiced in that? Because he had to give it all up when he
   became a Christian! And he said, "I thank God that I had a philosophy
   to throw away." He counted it no loss, but a gain, to be a loser of
   such learned lumber when he found a Savior! An old Divine said, "Who
   would refuse to give up a whole sky full of stars if he could buy a sun
   with them? And who would refuse to give up all the comforts of this
   life if he could have Christ at so goodly a price?" That grand old
   Ignatius, one of the earliest of the Church fathers, said, "Give me
   burning, give me hanging, give me all the torments of Hell if I may but
   get my Savior! I would gladly be content to bear them all as a price."
   And so might we! Did I not tell you of the martyrs sitting and singing
   in old Bonner's damp coal-hole, and one of them writing, "There are six
   brave companions with me in this paradise, and we do sit and sing in
   the dark all day"? Ah, yes, they were no losers! Did not Rutherford say
   when he declared that he had but one eye and his enemies had put that
   out--for that one eye was the preaching of the Gospel, an eye to the
   glory of God--and his enemies had made him silent in Aberdeen, so that
   he used to weep over his dumb and silent Sabbaths? Yet did he not say,
   "But how mistaken they are! They thought they sent me to a dungeon, but
   Christ has been so precious to me that I thought it to be the king's
   parlor and the very Paradise of God"?

   And did not Renwick say that oftentimes, when he had been out among the
   bogs on the Scotch mountains, hunted over the mosses, with the stars of
   God looking down upon the little congregation, that they had far more
   of God's fellowship than bishops had ever had in cathedrals, or than
   they, themselves, had ever had in their circles when, in brighter days,
   they had worshipped God in peace? The dragoons of Claverhouse and the
   uniformity of Charles II were incapable of quenching the joy of our
   Puritan and Covenanting forefathers! Their piety drew its mirth from
   deeper springs than kings

   could stop, or persecution could dry up. The saints of Christ have
   given Christ their all--and when they have given all, they have felt
   that they were the richer for their poverty and the happier for their
   sorrows! And when they have been in solitude for Christ, they have felt
   that they have had good company, for He has been with them to be their
   strength and their joy. You may have Christ at whatever price you will,
   but you will make a good bargain of it! I charge you, my dear Hearer,
   if it should come to this--that if you should have to sell your house
   and your home, if the wife of your bosom should become your enemy, if
   your children should refuse to know their own father or to look him in
   the face, if you should be banished from your country, if there should
   be a halter for your neck, and no grave for your body--you would make a
   good bargain in taking up my Lord and Master, for oh, He will claim you
   in the day when men disown you--and in the day when He comes, there
   shall be none so bright as those who have suffered for Him--

   "And they who, with their Leader,

   Have conquered in the fight,

   Forever and forever

   Are clad in robes of white!"

   Yes, if you suffer with Him, you shall also be glorified together! God
   grant you Grace to feel this to be true and to make any sacrifice as
   long as you can but "win Christ, and be found in Him."

   V. IF EVER YOU GET CHRIST, YOU WILL FIND HIM ALL GAIN AND NO LOSS!

   The Apostle says, "That I may win Christ" It is all winning and no
   losing. Why, if you get Christ, you will get life! Does He not give
   life and immortality to those that have Him? Yes, for He says, "he that
   believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." If you get
   Christ, you will get light. He said, "I am the light of the world: he
   that follows Me shall not walk in darkness." The Sun of Righteousness
   shall arise upon you! Get Christ and you shall get health--your soul
   shall leave her sicknesses with Him who bore her sickness in the days
   of His flesh. Get Christ and you shall get riches, "the unsearchable
   riches of Christ." You may be poor, perhaps, outwardly, but you shall
   be rich, yourselves, and be able to make many others rich--rich in
   faith, giving glory to God! Get Christ and prosperity shall not hurt
   you--your feet shall be like hinds' feet, to stand upon your high
   places. Get Christ and He will turn your bitter Marahs into sweet
   Elims. He is the Tree which, when put into the brackish water, makes it
   sweet to the taste. Affliction is no longer affliction when Christ is
   with us! Then the furnace glows, not with heat, alone, but with a
   golden Radiance, a present Glory when Christ treads the burning coals!

   Get Christ, Beloved, and you have got all your soul can wish for Now
   may you stretch your capacious powers to the utmost and, with a holy
   covetousness and a sacred greediness, desire all you can! You may open
   your mouth wide, for Christ will fill it. You may enlarge your desires,
   but the infinite riches of Christ will satisfy them at their largest
   and widest stretch. Get Christ and you have Heaven on earth, and shall
   have Heaven forever! Get Christ, and angels shall be your servitors!
   The wheels of Providence shall grind for your good, the chariot of God,
   which brings on the events prophesied in apocalyptic vision, shall
   bring only joy and peace to you--and you shall hear it said, both in
   time and in eternity--

   "'Tis with the righteous well." Get Christ and you have nothing to
   fear, and everything to hope for Get Christ and sin is buried in the
   Red Sea of Jesus' blood, while you are arrayed in the spotless
   righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ--Jehovah Tsidkenu, Himself! Get
   Christ and--what more shall I say? Then may you swim in seas of bliss!
   Then may you walk Elysian fields of holy joy even here on earth! Get
   Christ and you need not envy the angels! Get Christ and you may count
   yourselves to be raised up together and made to sit together in
   heavenly places with Him!

   Surely all this ought to make the sinner's mouth water to get Christ!
   It ought to make his heart ache till he gets Christ! It ought to set
   his soul a-hungering and a-thirsting till he gets Jesus! It ought to
   make him resolve that he will not be kept back till at last he gets a
   firm hold upon the Crucified!

   VI. My last remark shall be this--WE SHALL UNDERSTAND ALL THIS A GREAT
   DEAL BETTER VERY SOON.

   There is a curtain, but it is lifting, it is lifting, it is
   lifting--and when it is lifted, what do I see? The spirit world! 'Tis
   death that lifts the curtain and when it is lifted, these present
   things will vanish, for they are but shadows. The world of eternity and
   reality will then be seen. I would summon a jury of the spirits that
   have passed that curtain and they would not be long debating about the
   question whether Christ is worth the winning! I care not where you
   select them

   from--whether from among the condemned in Hell, or from among the
   beatified in Heaven. Let them sit, let even those who are in Hells it
   and judge upon the matter. And if they could for once speak honestly,
   they would tell you that it is a dreadful thing to despise Christ, now
   that they have come to see things in a true light--now that they are
   lost forever, forever, forever--now that they are crushed with
   knowledge and feeling which have come too late to be profitable-- now
   they wish that they had listened to the ministrations of the Truth of
   God, to the proclamations of the Gospel! If they could have a sane mind
   back again, they would shriek, "Oh, for one more Sabbath! Oh, to listen
   once more to an honest preacher, though his words might be clumsy and
   uncouth! Oh, to hear a voice once more say, 'Come to Jesus while the
   Day of Mercy lasts!' Oh, to be once more pressed to come to the
   marriage feast--once more bid to look to Jesus and to live!" I tell you
   Sirs, some of you who make so light of Sundays and think preaching is
   but a pastime, so that you come here to hear us as you would go to hear
   some fiddler on a weeknight--I tell you, Sirs, the lost in Hell reckon
   these things at a very different rate! And so will you before long,
   when another preacher, with skeleton fingers, shall talk to you upon
   your deathbed. Ah, then you will see that we were in earnest and you
   were the players--then you will comprehend that what we said to you
   demanded earnest, immediate attention, though, alas, you would not give
   it--and so played false to your own soul, committed spiritual suicide
   and went your way like a bullock to the slaughter--to be the murderers
   of your own spirits!

   But suppose I summoned a jury of bright spirits from Heaven? Ah, they
   would not need to consider, but I am sure they would unanimously say to
   you, if they might, "Seek you the Lord while He may be found! Seek the
   Lord and His strength. Seek the Lord and His face always--put your
   trust in Jesus, for He is sweet beyond all sweetness." May you do this
   and may you sing--

   "Oh, spread Your savor on my frame, No sweetness is so sweet! Till I
   get up to sing Your name Where all Your singers meet."

   Pray that prayer. Ask Him to save you and may the Lord bless you, for
   Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PHILIPPIANS3.

   Verse 1. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. Let this be the end
   of everything, before you get to the end of it. And when you do get to
   the end of it, "rejoice in the Lord." It is incumbent upon us, as
   Christians, to rise out of our despondencies. Joy should be the normal
   state of the Christian. What a happy religion is ours in which it is a
   duty to be happy! "Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord."

   1. To write the same things to you, to me, indeed, is not grievous, but
   for you it is safe. To go over the same old Truths again and again, to
   proclaim the same precepts and teach the same Doctrines is not grievous
   to us, and it is safe for you to hear these things again and again. If
   they have not made their due impression upon you, already, perhaps they
   will do so when they are repeated in your hearing. At any rate, it is
   safe for you to hear or read over and over again the old, old story
   with which you are already familiar.

   2. Beware of dogs. Contentious persons--persons of coarse and corrupt
   habits. "Beware of dogs."

   2. Beware of evil workers. However prettily they may talk, if they are
   workers of evil, beware of them. "By their fruits you shall know them."
   Their speech may be clever, but if their lips are unclean, beware of
   them.

   2. Beware of the concision. Beware of the cutters off, those who
   excommunicate and cut off others because they do not happen to agree
   with them in certain rites and ceremonies.

   3. For we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit, and
   rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. This is
   the real circumcision which is of the spirit and not of the flesh. The
   men who have abandoned all confidence in themselves. The men who have
   come to rely upon Christ, alone. The men who "rejoice in Christ Jesus,
   and have no confidence in the flesh," those who care not for outward
   rites and ceremonies, but who worship God in the spirit-- these are the
   true circumcision!

   4. Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. "If any man might
   trust in outward religion, I might," said Paul, yet he was the very man
   who would not do so, and who warned others against doing it!

   4-6. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more:
   circumcised the eight day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe
   ofBenjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the Law, a Pharisee;
   concerning zeal, persecuting the Church; touching the righteousness
   which is in the Law, blameless. So that if anybody could have boasted
   of what he was by birth, what he was by profession, what he was by the
   display of religious zeal--Paul could have boasted as boldly as anyone
   could, for in all those respects he was second to nobody! You know that
   it is a very easy thing, or it ought to be a very easy thing, for some
   people to be humble, for they have nothing to be proud of--but here is
   a man who had much of which he might have been proud! According to the
   letter of the Law, he was a diamond of the first water, yet see what a
   different verdict he gives after Divine Grace has opened his eyes!

   7-9. But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ
   Yes, indeed, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the
   knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of
   all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be
   found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but
   that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is
   of God by faith. [See Sermon #1357, Volume 23--A businesslike ACCOUNT.]
   Everything else must go in order to secure that.

   Paul thinks that to be righteous by faith is infinitely better than all
   the righteousness that can come by works and ceremonies. He therefore
   utterly despises that which he once thought to be more precious that
   gold! And he takes possession of, as his greatest treasure, that which
   he once trampled in the mire. Now his great desire is--

   10-12. That I may know Him, and the power of His Resurrection, and the
   fellowship of His sufferings, being made comfortable unto His death; if
   by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. Not as
   though I had already attained, either were already perfect You,
   perhaps, suppose that Paul's present satisfaction arises out of a
   consciousness of personal perfection, but it is not so. He has not won
   the race yet--his joy arises from the fact that he is on the right
   course and that he is running in the right direction! "Not as though I
   had already attained, either were already perfect."

   12. But I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I
   am apprehended of Christ Jesus. [See Sermon #2315,

   Volume 39--PAUL APPREHENDED AND APPREHENDING.] "I want to lay

   hold of that for which Christ has laid hold of me. He has grasped me in
   order to make me perfect and I want to grasp that perfection. He has
   laid hold of me to rid me of my sin and I want to lay hold of a clean
   riddance of sin, apprehending that for which also I am apprehended of
   Christ Jesus."

   13-15. Brethren, Icount not myself to have apprehended: but this one
   thing Ido, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth
   unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the
   prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as
   many as are mature, be thus minded: and if in anything you are
   otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. If you are a
   true Believer in Jesus, be of this mind--always to be pressing forward
   to something higher and better. If God has given you one form of
   maturity, press onward to a much higher form. Seek continually to rise.
   The eagle's motto is, "Higher, Higher!" Let it be your motto, too. Many
   of God's people do not believe that He can make them what He means to
   make them, or, at least, they act as if they did not believe that He
   can. They apparently are not conscious of what their privileges really
   are and are living far below where they might live in the happy
   enjoyment of peace and power and usefulness! May God help us, by His
   gracious Spirit, to know all of Christ that we can and to be as much
   like Christ as we can.

   16-18. Nevertheless, to the degree we have already attained, let us
   walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. Brethren, be
   followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us
   for an example. (For many walk)--I suppose Paul is referring to many
   even in the Church of his day. "For many walk"--

   18. Ofwhom Ihave toldyou often, andnow tellyou even weeping, that they
   are the enemies ofthe Cross ofChrist

   [See Sermons #102, Volume 2--FALSE PROFESSORS SOLEMNLY WARNED and
   #2553, Volume 44--THE ENEMIES OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST.] The worst
   enemies that the Cross of Christ has are the enemies inside the
   professing Church of Christ!

   19. Whose endis destruction, whose Godis their belly, and whose glory
   is in their shame, who mind earthly things. They call themselves
   spiritual, yet they live for earthly things, indulging their appetites,
   living for self, yet pretending to be Christians, whereas selfishness
   is the very reverse of Christianity.

   20, 21. For our conversation is in Heaven; from where also we look for
   thee Savior, thee LordJesus Christ: who shall change our vile body,
   that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the
   working whereby He is able

   even to subdue all things unto Himself [See Sermon #973, Volume 17--THE
   POWER OF CHRIST ILLUSTRATED BY THE RESURRECTION.]

Clinging to Christ

   (No. 3210)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 11, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   12, 1863.

   "Then Jesus said unto the twelve, Will you also go away? Then Simon
   Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of
   eternal life." John 6:67, 68.

   [See Sermons #2914, Volume 50--A MOURNFUL DEFECTION and #1646, Volume
   28--A HOME QUESTION AND A RIGHT ANSWER.]

   I. WITHOUT any preface, we will proceed at once to consider the first
   division of our subject, which is that THE PREACHING OF THE DOCTRINES
   OF TRUTH IS OFTEN THE MEANS OF SEPARATING THE PRECIOUS FROM THE VILE.

   In the case before us, we see that the preaching of the Lord Jesus
   Christ acted like a great winnowing machine. His nominal disciples were
   like a heap of wheat and chaff all mingled together on the threshing
   floor. His words were like a mighty wind passing through the whole
   mass, separating the chaff from the wheat and driving it away--leaving
   only the good corn lying all around Him. This leads me to say that
   apart from afflictions, temptations and persecutions, the preaching of
   the Gospel is, in itself, a means of dividing the true followers of
   Christ from those who are only His disciples in name and, wherever
   there is a faithful, Christ-like ministry, you will find many going
   away from it for the very same reasons that those nominal disciples
   went away from Christ. "From that time many of His disciples went back
   and walked no more with Him."

   Some went away from Christ because His doctrine was too mysterious.
   They heard His wondrous words only with their outward ears and, judging
   them in the letter and not comprehending the spirit of them, they said,
   "This is a hard saying; who can hear it?" They misunderstood and
   misrepresented what intelligent Sunday school children nowadays easily
   comprehend! And as they did not know what the Savior really meant, they
   argued that this was a reason why they should not listen to Him any
   longer. We must, therefore, not be surprised if when we are speaking to
   our congregations upon the deep things of God, there are some who do
   not comprehend the spiritual meaning of what we are saying, and who,
   instead of patiently waiting until they can understand it, or coming to
   us for an explanation of their difficulties, turn away from us, crying,
   "We will hear no more of these mysteries! We cannot at once understand
   them and, therefore, we will not take the trouble to learn what the
   preacher intends to teach us by them."

   Others went away from Christ because His teaching was too spiritual for
   them. He said to them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except you eat
   the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you have no life in
   you." They gave only a carnal interpretation to Christ's words and
   altogether missed their spiritual meaning. If He had talked to them as
   the Pharisees did, they would have understood Him and enjoyed His
   message. If Christ had spoken to them about phylacteries, making broad
   the borders of their garments, the tithing of mint and anise and
   cummin, fasting two or three days in a week and washing their hands
   before they ate bread, they would have comprehended such talk as that
   and would have exceedingly liked it! And there are still many, even in
   England, who would listen gladly to the praise of mere outward rites
   and ceremonies and who would find intense satisfaction in millinery,
   wax candles, crosses and anything that is externally ornamental or
   attractive--but they have no love for that which is spiritual! Our
   Lord's teaching was too spiritual for those nominal followers of His.
   He did not give them husks such as swine might relish, but He gave them
   the very kernels of the Truth of God and, therefore, they turned away
   from Him. He gave them not chaff, but the very finest of the wheat--but
   they, being unrenewed by Divine Grace and, therefore, having no
   appetite for such food, "went back, and

   walked no more with Him." And every ministry that is truly spiritual
   will drive away some who come for a while under its influence, for
   there are still many to be found who will say, "If the preacher would
   confine himself to moral duties, or even to Scripture histories, we
   would not mind listening to him. But when he talks about feeding upon
   Christ, and about communion with Jesus, and about the spiritual
   separated life, these are things of which we know nothing and of which
   we do not wish to know anything." And so they go their way.

   Others there were, no doubt, who were offended with Christ because what
   He said glorified Himself. He contrasted Himself with the manna that
   their fathers ate in the wilderness and of which they naturally thought
   very highly, for man then "ate angels' food." But Jesus said, "Your
   fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead...I am the Living
   Bread which came down from Heaven: if any man eat of this Bread, he
   shall live forever." He proclaimed Himself the Son of Man who came down
   from Heaven and who would go back to Heaven--and this offended
   them--and there are still many to whom the glorifying of Christ is
   obnoxious. If the Doctrine that is preached glorifies the Creator and
   abases the creature, there are some of our hearers who at once get
   angry! They cannot endure the extolling of our glorious Lord and
   Master. Our praise of Him makes discord in their ears. If we would
   prate about the dignity of human nature. If we would extol that poor
   foolish creature, the son of Adam, they would be pleased enough! But to
   put all crowns upon Jesus Christ's head, to ascribe all honor and glory
   to Him and to Him alone--to preach up nothing but a full Christ for
   empty sinners--there are many who will be annoyed by such preaching as
   this and straightway they will turn back and walk no more with us.

   Chiefly, however, Christ's nominal disciples left Him because His
   preaching was too personal for them. He proclaimed what was in their
   hearts and, therefore, He spoke to them with the utmost directness. And
   this plainness of speech offended them, so they turned away from Him.
   How many sermons have been preached before people and how few have been
   preached atthem! Yet the sermons that are preached beforeus are good
   for nothing, but the sermons that are preached at us are the only ones
   that are likely to be blessed to us! We have known some hearers who
   have winced considerably when the preaching has been plain and
   personal. The description of their case has been so graphic and the cap
   fitted them so well that, rather than wear it, they have taken
   themselves to a preacher with a smoother tongue, who--

   "To soothe the unholy throng"-- has laid aside the boldness of speech
   which it is both his privilege and his duty to exercise! There are some
   of our hearers who suspect that somebody has told the minister all
   about them--but what has happened is that God has guided the preacher
   unconsciously to picture them so accurately that they cannot help
   recognizing their own portrait! One says, "I do not like the preacher
   because he tells me so much about my sins." Another, who is a drunk,
   says, "I do not like him because, after listening to him, I cannot
   enjoy my cups as I did before." Another, who is the slave of some other
   form of sin, says, "I do not like him because he lays the axe to the
   very root of the tree of my sin. His blows come too closely home to
   please me." There are others who are not honest enough to confess that
   it is so with them, also, but though they may not admit it, this is
   really the fact--they do not like the Truth of God because the Truth of
   God does not like them!

   We have in all our congregations a certain number of hearers who make
   great professions for a time, but afterwards go back and leave us. The
   reason very often being that the preaching has sifted them out from the
   wheat and proved that they are only chaff. I know that some of you feel
   very uncomfortable when I am preaching the Doctrine of Election or any
   of the other great Doctrines of Sovereign Grace. I am very sorry for
   any of you who cannot appreciate those glorious Truths of God in which
   my soul delights itself to the fullest--and I would earnestly and
   solemnly urge you to examine yourselves to see whether you have ever
   had Divine Grace in your hearts at all if you do not love to hear the
   Doctrines of Grace preached! There are others, though not many in this
   congregation, who are not pleased when I begin preaching concerning
   human responsibility and the duty of sinners to repent and believe the
   Gospel. They do not like to hear me proclaim that part of the Truth of
   God, though they revel in Divine Sovereignty, Predestination, Election
   and such great Truths! So it comes to pass that there is, occasionally,
   a small stream of hearers trickling away towards Antino-mianism, and
   another stream flowing in the opposite direction towards legalism! I
   hope that at least in the case of some of them, though they leave us,
   they do not, at the same time, leave Christ! A man may turn away from
   sound Doctrine and yet may not have left a personal Savior. Though he
   may have rejected some part of the Truth of God, he may still have his
   finger upon the hem of Christ's garment, and so may remain in contact
   with Him. But I am greatly afraid that there are some who leave us, who
   go away to Hell! Some who, when they forsake the Lord's House, also
   forsake the Lord

   of the house. Some who, when they leave the congregation of the saints,
   also leave the King of saints and turn aside unto crooked ways.

   II. Well now, suppose that they do leave Christ when they leave us?
   That suggests a second topic of consideration in

   our text, which is that WHEN SOME PEOPLE GO AWAY, WE MUST NOT BE
   SURPRISED, NOR UNDULY ALARMED.

   You notice that in the narrative there is no mention of any remark by
   Christ concerning those who had turned back, nor any expression of a
   desire for their return. He could read their hearts and knew the
   motives that had caused them to reject His teaching and cease to be
   even nominally His followers, so He turned to His 12 Apostles and put
   to them the pathetic question which we will presently examine--"Will
   you also go away?" This silence of our Savior concerning those who were
   driven away from Him by His preaching of the Truth of God suggests that
   they were not plants of His Father's right-hand planting, but only
   weeds that had to be pulled up by the roots and thrown away!

   Among Christ's nominal disciples, there were some who followed Him for
   the loaves and fishes. They enjoyed His discourses, especially those
   that finished up with the feeding of the multitude! They were greatly
   gratified by being in His society, especially when they shared in the
   distribution that was made to the poor out of the bag that Judas
   carried as treasurer to the company. They always profited under
   Christ's ministry, but if they did not profit in spirituals, they took
   good care to profit in temporals! These were the people who went away
   from Christ when He set before them the spiritual meat and drink which
   had no attraction for them. "No," they said, "we did not bargain for
   that kind of fare. Let those have it who like it. As for us, we need
   something more substantial than that" and, therefore, from that time
   they "went back, and walked no more with Him." There are a few people
   of this sort in most congregations even now. They always have an eye to
   anything material that can be gained by mingling with the disciples of
   Christ. But as soon as there are no more loaves and fishes to be had,
   no more doles or grants or gifts--away they go-- and we see them no
   more in our midst! Now, when such people as these take offense at the
   Truth of God and leave us, we really need not regret their going except
   for their own sakes. While they remain with us, there is always a faint
   hope that some higher motive may cause them to stay and that the
   nominal follower of Christ may become one of His true disciples. But,
   apart from that view of the case, we cannot greatly mourn when He,
   whose fan is in His hand, drives away the chaff which has been all too
   long reckoned as wheat!

   Then, among the apparent disciples of Christ, were some who followed
   Him because they were charmed by His oratory. Even the officers who
   were sent by the chief priests and Pharisees to arrest Christ returned
   without Him and gave as their excuse for not taking Him, "Never man
   spoke like this Man." He was, indeed, unrivalled in His eloquence. His
   parables were so interesting that they won the attention of the
   multitude--"the common people heard Him gladly." There is a great power
   of attraction in real natural oratory--and in our Lord's case there was
   a Divine Power far beyond anything to which the loftiest human
   eloquence has ever attained. So there were many who said, "We never
   heard such a preacher as this before. Wherever He preaches, there is
   sure to be a crowd. The multitudes throng around Him and press upon
   Him! Let us also go and hear Him." As they listened to Him, their ears
   were charmed, but their hearts were not changed and, by-and-by, they
   "went back, and walked no more with Him." We also have had nominal
   adherents of this sort. We are always glad to see all who come to hear
   the Word, but if they unite with the disciples of Christ simply because
   of some excellence of speech which they admire in the preacher and are
   not, themselves, truly converted, the sooner such dross is scrummed
   from the surface of the molten gold, the better will it be for the
   gold!

   Others, no doubt, followed Christ for a time because they liked
   anything new, curious and singular. Here was a strange preacher who had
   not even a house to live in. The foxes had holes and the birds of the
   air had nests, but He had nowhere to lay His head. He was also a
   preacher who said and did unusual things. He saw some lilies growing
   and He said, "Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they
   spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not
   arrayed like one of these." He pointed to some ravens flying overhead,
   and said, "Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
   neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are
   you better than the fowls?" He was a preacher who used simple language,
   so that even children could comprehend it! Yet, at the same time, He
   talked so wondrously that the people were astonished at His Doctrine,
   for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."
   Yet, when the novelty of His teaching had worn off, they "went back,
   and walked no more with Him." There are some people of this sort still
   living--they go to hear every fresh preacher who attracts a crowd and
   they may be sufficiently fascinated to gain admission to the church.
   But they vanish as soon as there is a new attraction! And any church
   that has had them on its roll need not sorrow greatly when the chaff is
   winnowed from the wheat.

   So I might go on describing those who go away from us even as Christ's
   nominal followers went away from Him, but I will just say to any
   minister here who has lost any of his hearers through his faithful
   preaching of the Truth, "Do not fret, my dear Brother, on their
   account, and do not abate a single jot or tittle of anything that you
   believe to be the Truth of God." I would not alter my preaching in
   order to retain any individual, however eminent or influential he might
   be. Others may fish for him if they like, but I shall not. My business
   is to declare my Master's message exactly as He has revealed it to me
   in His Word and by His Spirit! I am responsible to Him for the faithful
   discharge of the duties to which He has called me--and when I have, in
   His name, fully and fearlessly proclaimed all the Truth that He has
   taught me, I am not to be blamed if some refuse to receive the Word,
   and so it becomes a savor of death unto death to them. It was so with
   the preaching of our Lord Himself, for there were many who "went back,
   and walked no more with Him," when He uttered Truths of God which were
   unpalatable to them.

   III. Now I come to the very important matter upon which I want to
   especially speak to you, as it particularly concerns you who are now
   present. Some have gone out from us because they were not of us, for if
   they had really been of us they would doubtless have continued with us.
   And this fact suggests the need of putting to you THE SOLEMN QUESTION
   WHICH OUR LORD PUT TO HIS DISCIPLES--"Will you also go away?"

   Every word in this question is important. Let us first consider the
   little pronoun, "you." "Will you also go away?" "You, the 12 who have
   been with Me from the beginning. You who have been with Me in my
   tribulation and have shared My reproach. You who were, some of you with
   Me on the Mount of Transfiguration and in the room where the little
   maid was bid to rise--will you go away from Me? To you," Christ seemed
   to say, "I have expounded the parables as I never explained them to the
   mixed multitude. To you I have unlocked the mysteries of the Kingdom of
   God. To you My heart has been opened as it has been to no one else--I
   have not kept back from you anything that was good for you to know--you
   are My chosen ones, My favorites, My much-loved ones. To deliver you
   from peril, I walked upon the stormy waves. To preserve you in the time
   of temptation, I spent whole nights in prayer. Upon you I have poured a
   plenitude of blessings--will you go away from Me after all this?" Now
   Christ seems to me to put this solemn, personal question to you, my
   dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ! Will you go away from Him after
   all that He has done for you? You believe that you have been called by
   His Grace, for you have enjoyed the sweetness of His love and you have
   been admitted into close personal fellowship with Him. The secret of
   the Lord is with you who fear Him. He has delivered you in six
   troubles, and in seven no evil has touched you. You bear your willing
   witness that He is a gracious Lord and Master, and that He has been a
   precious Christ to you! Indeed, you say that He is your All-in-All and
   that words fail you to tell all that you think of Him! Then canyou,
   willyou go away from Him after all this? I think I know what your
   answer must be, but I will not speak of that just now.

   Now put the emphasis upon the first word in the question--" Willyou
   also go away?" Matthew Henry says that our Lord left the disciples to
   make the choice whether they would go or stay--and then he observes
   that, "Christ will detain none with Him against their wills. His
   soldiers are volunteers, not pressed men." Christ also says to us who
   profess to be His disciples, "Will you go away from Me?" Remember this,
   beloved Friends, although the Spirit of God keeps us following Christ,
   yet He never does this against our wills. He makes us willing in the
   day of His power, but still, it is quite true that Christ has no
   unwilling followers. If you are willing to leave Him. If your will
   would permit you to be a deserter from the army of Christ, you have
   already deserted! So I put the question to you as though the whole
   matter rested with you, "Will you go away from your Lord and Master? Do
   you really wish to leave your Savior? Do you, in your heart, say, "I
   will never again endure suffering and reproach for His name's sake. I
   will never again put my trust in Him who died upon the Cross. I will go
   back to the world and be content with the world's joys and pleasures"?
   Will you thus go away from Christ and walk no more with Him?

   Then take the next word in the question: "Will you also go away?" There
   is often a disposition in us to do what others do. Young man, you know
   that your father, who once professed to be a follower of Christ,
   afterwards apostatized. Will you, also, go back because he turned
   traitor to Christ? When some great monarch among the trees of the
   forest feels the woodman's axe and quivers and, at last, falls with a
   tremendous crash, many a shrub and plant that grew securely

   near it are crushed to death by its fall. And so, sometimes, when some
   great professor falls and goes down to destruction, there are many
   young Believers, growing, as it were, under his shadow, who are in
   imminent peril of being dragged down with him! Now, my young Friends,
   you have heard that So-and-So and So-and-So have turned back, like
   Pliable, to the City of Destruction--"will you also go away?" Will the
   tide also sweep you away, or will you, by the Grace of God, swim
   against it? There it goes, broad and deep! Upon its surface is the foam
   of pleasure, but in its depths is the damnation of Hell--will you also
   float adown it as multitudes of others are doing, or will you stem the
   current--

   "Strong in the strength which God supplies Through His eternal Son"?

   We must, all of us know some of these reprobates who once were numbered
   among the people of God. There is one who used to partake of the
   Communion Cup at the Lord's Table, but now he is drinking of the cup of
   devils at the bar of the gin palace--"will you also go away" as he has
   gone? There is another who used to go up to the House of Prayer and his
   voice was often heard at the Prayer Meetings. But the greed of gold
   sized him and now he is a sordid money-grabber and he would grind an
   orphan's bones if they would make him bread! "Will you also go away" as
   he has gone? Saddest of all, there is one who used to preach the Gospel
   and many were charmed by his brilliant oratory. But now he is
   blaspheming God with his fellow infidels! "Will you also go away" as he
   has gone? Young men and women, and old ones, too, you see what the
   apostates have become! You see what has happened to some who apparently
   did run well, but who never really started in the right course--or they
   would have continued in it till they reached the goal. You see how some
   who left the harbor with a fair wind and all sails set have made
   shipwreck of faith because they never knew the Grace of God in
   truth--are you willing to be like they? "Will you also go away?" I know
   I shall not be alone in giving the answer that John Newton puts into
   his well-known hymn--

   "When any turn from Zion's way (Alas, what numbers do)! I think I hear
   my Savior say, 'Willyou forsake Me too?' Ah, Lord, with such a heart as
   mine, Unless You hold me fast I feel I will! I shall decline, And prove
   like they at last. What anguish has that question stirred, If I will
   also go?

   Yet, Lord, relying on Your Word, I humbly answer, 'No.'"

   IV. Now, as briefly as we can, let us consider PETER'S REPLY TO OUR
   LORD'S QUESTION, and I hope that

   many a heart here will make that reply its own. It was a grand answer!
   There is a magnificence about it which I cannot expect to bring out to
   the fullest--"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal
   life."

   "Lord, to whom shall we go?" When I was meditating upon this subject
   yesterday, I turned that question over and over again in my mind and I
   asked myself, "Where could I go if I were to forsake my Lord?" Earth
   has no place where I could hide my guilty head if I, after preaching
   the Gospel to others, should desert the Cross of Christ! Not even
   across the ocean could I find a harbor of refuge or a hermit's cave
   where I could secure seclusion if I tried to run away from my Lord. I
   would be hounded and denounced everywhere by those who know my name,
   even if they do not know me, as one who has preached the Gospel to tens
   of thousands. And I should be pointed at by the finger of scorn and all
   who have desired my fall would gloat over it--and think me only fit to
   be a football for Satan and his hosts to kick. I can indeed adopt John
   Newton's lines and say with him to my dear Lord and Savior--

   "To whom or where could I go If I should turn from You?"

   That is how I personally feel with regard to Peter's reply to our
   Lord's question. Will each one of you put the matter before yourself
   from your own standpoint as I have put it from mine? Let me take the
   case of any avowed follower of Christ here. Where could you go to find
   comfort if you should forsake your Lord? Suppose you turn from
   Christ--perhaps you might try to find peace and comfort in ceremonies.
   Can you imagine yourself sitting or kneeling in a Popish place of

   worship? Can you think of yourself as trying to get comfort by watching
   those boys in white swinging the smoking censers, or those men in blue
   and purple and scarlet and fine linen bowing before their images and
   chanting in a language that you probably do not understand? Can you
   imagine yourself deriving comfort from those wax candles, those
   crucifixes or that little wafer-god of which the idolaters think so
   much? Could you get comfort out of the gorgeous architecture, the dim
   religious light, the pealing organ and all the paraphernalia
   inseparably associated with the Romish ritual? If you should ever spend
   a few minutes in one of those places, I think you would say, "Well,
   whatever becomes of me, I could not come here! I know too much to ever
   put any trust in such childish ceremonies and superstitious
   observances. I cannot im-aginemy soul ever being satisfied with such
   husks as these."

   Next, let us suppose that you go to Moses and try to be saved by the
   Law. As you have given up Christ, you try whether you cannot find
   comfort in your own good works. You become eminently religious, devout,
   charitable, moral and upright. You try, from morning till night, to
   live a perfect life. You are wanting to see if you can, by any means,
   build a road to Heaven for yourself, or construct a ladder out of your
   own good works by which you can reach God's Presence in Glory. Now, my
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, what do you think of such a scheme as
   this? "Oh, Sir!" says one friend, "I once tried to go round by Mount
   Sinai, but there were such lightning and thunder--and the mountain was
   so full of terror to me that I dare not go that way again! Whatever
   else I might do, I could not go back again to the beggarly elements of
   the old Law! I did once think that I could be saved by my own good
   works, but I found that I had launched my boat upon such a stormy sea
   that I was glad to get back to land again--and I shall never again
   venture out upon those perilous waters." I expect this friend says just
   what many more of you feel--that you could no more go back to Moses,
   and seek to be saved by the Law--than you could hope to be saved by
   Popish rites and ceremonies!

   We will suppose, next, that you try to live an utterly careless life.
   Let us imagine, if we can, that you give up all thoughts of religion,
   that you do not attend any place of worship, that you abandon your
   present habit of prayer, Bible reading and so on, and that you just
   settle down to attend to your earthly business and have no care about
   the business of the world to come! Can you manage to do that? There are
   many, all around us, who are constantly acting thus--and some of them
   are quite used to it by this time, for they have never cared for
   anything but the things of time and sense. But I am quite sure there is
   no true child of God who could live such a life as that! If some of you
   were to stay away from the House of God for a month, you know that you
   would be utterly miserable! You could not help thinking about Divine
   things--they would force themselves upon you, for you have a conscience
   which is neither dead nor seared. It is like that Mr. Conscience, of
   whom John Bunyan says in his Holy War--"The old gentleman, too, the
   Recorder, who was so before Diabolus took Mansoul--he also began to
   talk aloud. And his words were now to the town of Mansoul as if they
   were great claps of thunder." It is so with you, and that enlightened
   and awakened conscience of yours would make you, of all men, most
   miserable if you tried to live a careless, godless life! Why, you know
   that even when you are dull and heavy with regard to spiritual things,
   you are most unhappy, and you cry out in your agony--

   "Dear Lord, and shall we always live At this poor dying rate?"

   Well, if you cannot endure that state of things even in a small degree,
   it is quite certain that you could not endure it altogether! So, if you
   think of leaving your Lord, it is evident that you could not live in
   utter carelessness.

   Suppose that you turn aside to the pleasures of the world. Suppose you
   take a ticket tomorrow evening for the theater and go there? The moment
   you had taken your seat, you would say to yourself, "I wish I had never
   come in this place." And as soon as the performance began, you would be
   so nervous and unhappy that at every creaking noise, or the slamming of
   a door, you would fear that the building was about to tumble down upon
   you! Such amusements as these are not for us who profess to be
   followers of the Crucified! Let others do as they please--we do not
   interfere with their liberty. We believe that husks are the proper food
   for swine, but we have no desire to share the feast with them! And we
   leave the world's pleasures to the men of the world who have their
   portion in this life. If we have really received a new life, and been
   made partakers of the Divine Nature, it would be no use for us to seek
   satisfaction in the world's pleasures--we would be obliged to cry out,
   "Vanity of vanities! All is vanity!"

   Now just once more, suppose we leave Christ and turn to the lower and
   grosser forms of vice. Why, the mere suggestion seems to make our blood
   run cold and then to make us blush with shame at the very thought of
   such degradation! Some of us tremble every time we hear a profane oath
   or a blasphemous or obscene expression--and we would rather be

   tied up and whipped with a cat-o'nine-tails, than live among those who
   are continually cursing God! And as for doing it, ourselves, we would
   rather that our tongue should cleave to the roof of our mouth, or that
   we should be dumb for the rest of our lives! If one has ever known the
   woe, sorrow and redness of eyes of the drunk--and been saved from such
   sin and wretchedness by Sovereign Grace--how can he or she ever go back
   to their cups again? If one has been the companion of a harlot and has
   tasted the bitterness of life (or rather, death) in the house of the
   strange woman--and yet has been delivered by Almighty Grace--how can
   you ever again wallow in such filth? The very thought of such a thing
   makes us shudder and it is well that it does! God has made all sin to
   be full of vinegar and gall to a Christian! And there is nothing sweet
   to him, the wide world over, but that which appertains to Christ! No,
   my Brothers and Sisters, we cannot go back to the world and to sin! We
   must cling to Christ, for there is nowhere else for us to go if we
   should ever leave Him. Respectable carelessness refuses us and
   disreputable sin rejects us after we are once united to Christ! Even
   the world could not endure us when once we have lost our taste for its
   follies and its sins. We cannot go back, we have burnt our boats and
   destroyed our bridges--the only course left to us is to follow our
   glorious Leader wherever He goes before us here and then to follow Him
   forever in that blest state where it shall be impossible for us to go
   away from Him!

   My time has almost gone, but I must remind you of the last words of
   Peter's reply to his Lord--" You have the words of eternal life." I
   hope that you, also, dear Brothers and Sisters, feel that you cannot
   turn back from Christ because He has saved you by His Grace. What He
   has done for us must bind us forever to Him! He has loved us with an
   everlasting love. He has given Himself for us on Calvary's Cross. He
   has given us His Spirit and Word--a new heart and a right spirit has He
   put within us--we cannot and we will not desert Him after all this!
   Besides, He is our hope for the eternity of bliss that we expect to
   share with Him. All our hopes of life beyond the grave center in Him.
   Apart from Him, there would be nothing for us but the blackness of
   darkness forever! So it is impossible for us to turn away from Him. No,
   we must cling to Him whatever happens, for there is nothing or no one
   that can ever take His place--

   "None among the sons of men,

   None among the heavenly train,

   Can with Jesus Christ compare,

   None so sweet, and none so fair!" I wish that some who have never yet
   been followers of the Lord Jesus Christ would become His disciples
   right now. But remember that if you enlist beneath His banner, it is
   for life. The Captain of our salvation has not six-months' soldiers--He
   grants no discharge from His army till the fight is fought, the victory
   won and the crown is bestowed upon those who have been faithful even
   unto death! Those are the conditions of His service. Will you accept
   them and enlist in His army tonight? There is nothing for you to pay,
   but everything for you to receive! Open your empty hand, bring your
   empty heart and receive Christ--and so shall you be enlisted into His
   service! And more than that, you shall become members of the great
   family of the redeemed, for "as many as received Him, to them He gave
   power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His
   name." Believe on Him now and you, too, shall become the children of
   God by faith in Christ Jesus! And then if He says to you, when others
   turn back and walk no more with Him, "Will you also go away?" you will
   answer, as Peter did, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of
   eternal life." The Lord bless you, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

"Feed My Sheep"

   (No. 3211)

   A SERMON TO MINISTERS AND STUDENTS, PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 18,
   1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE PASTOR'S COLLEGE CONFERENCE, ON FRIDAY MORNING, APRIL 13, 1877.

   "He said unto him, Feed My sheep." John 21:16.

   THOSE whom the Lord addressed, and especially Simon, had become
   fishermen. "Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of great
   fishes." In the early part of your career most of you were fishermen,
   or men-catchers and, truly, to be fishers of men should be your
   ambition all your lives. But you have now become something more--the
   fisher has developed into a shepherd. The fisherman represents the
   Evangelist who casts the net into the waters and draws the fish to
   land, but it is not to him that Christ says, "Feed My sheep"--that is
   reserved for those of greater maturity and experience. Many of you have
   now for years been settled in one sphere and while you will continue to
   fish, I trust that more and more you will remember that you now have
   other duties to perform--you have to feed as well as to fish, to handle
   the crook as well as the net. We now leave the sea wherein we were
   drifted to and fro, and we abide among our own flocks, standing and
   feeding in the strength of the Lord. We cease not to do the work of an
   Evangelist, but we pay special attention to the duties of the pastor,
   for He who once said, "Cast the net on the right side of the ship," now
   says to us, "Feed My sheep." I am addressing disciples to whom the Lord
   has shown Himself--may He now at this happy season commission us anew
   and send us home with the Word which He spoke to Peter resting in our
   hearts!

   I. This was a sort of ordination of Peter to the pastorate. He needed
   to be publicly recognized, for he had publicly offended. And his
   ordination commenced with AN EXAMINATION BEARING ON THE WORK. "Jesus
   said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love Me?" Our Lord
   does not admit any to the oversight of His flock without first of all
   questioning them as to their inner condition. Neither should any man
   dare to accept such an office without great self-examination and
   searching of heart. Many questions should be put to our hearts and
   answered as in the sight of God, for no man rightly takes this honor
   upon himself but he that is called thereunto--neither is every man
   fitted for the work but he, alone, who is anointed of the Lord. You
   will observe that the examination was directed to the state of Peter's
   heart--and so it touched the innermost spring of all his religion--for
   if love is absent, all is vain--the heart of godliness is missing where
   love is lacking.

   Love is the chief endowment for a pastor. You must love Christ if you
   mean to serve Him in the capacity of pastors. Our Lord deals with the
   most vital point. The question is not, "Simon, son of Jonas, do you
   know Me?" though that would not have been an unreasonable question,
   since Peter had said, "I know not the Man." He might have asked,
   "Simon, son of Jonas, do you know the deep mysteries of God?" He did
   know them, for his Lord had called him blessed for knowing that which
   flesh and blood had not revealed to him. Our great Bishop of souls did
   not examine him with regard to his mental endowments, nor upon his
   other spiritual qualifications, but only upon this one, "Simon, son of
   Jonas, do you love Me?" If so, then, "Feed My sheep." Does not this
   plainly show us that the chief endowment of the pastor is to love
   Christ supremely? Only such a man as that is fit to look after Christ's
   sheep. You will fulfill that office well if you love Jesus--your love
   will keep you in your Lord's company, it will hold you under His
   immediate supervision and will secure you His help. Love to Him will
   breed a love for all His sheep and your love for them will give you
   power over them. Experience testifies that we never gain a particle of
   power for good over our people by angry words, but we obtain an almost
   absolute power over them by all-enduring love--indeed, the only power
   which is desirable for us to have must come in that way! I have had the
   high pleasure of loving some of the most objectionable people till they
   loved me. And

   some of the most bitter I have altogether won by refusing to be
   displeased, and by persisting in believing that they could be better.
   By practical kindnesses I have so won some men that I believe it would
   take a martyrdom to make them speak evil of me. This has also been the
   experience of all who have tried the sacred power of love!

   My Brothers, learn the art of loving men to Christ! We are drawn
   towards those who love us and when the most callous feel "that man
   loves us," they are drawn to you at once--and as you are nearer to the
   Savior than they are--you are drawing them in the right direction. You
   cannot look after God's people and properly care for them in all their
   sins, temptations, trials and difficulties, unless you love them. You
   will grow sick and weary of pastoral work unless there is a fresh
   spring of love in your heart welling up towards them. A mother tires
   not of watching by the bedside of her sick child because love sustains
   her--she will outlast the paid nurse by many an hour! Love props her
   drooping eyelids. Even so, "the hireling flees because he is an
   hireling and cares not for the sheep," but, "the good Shepherd gives
   His life for the sheep." If you really love the sheep, you will be
   ready to spend your life for them or even to lay it down for their
   sakes. Love, then, I take to be the chief endowment of the
   pastor--although having that, I trust you will not fall short in any
   other respect but be thoroughly furnished unto every good work. Do not
   forget what you have been told about study and culture, but remember at
   the same time that the heart has more power in pastoral work than the
   head. In this ministry, a humble, godly, ill-educated man with a great,
   warm, heart will be blessed far more than the large-headed man whose
   heart is a little diamond of rock-ice which could not be discovered
   without a microscope even if he were dissected!

   The Lord Jesus Christ connected His examination upon the matter of love
   with the commission, "Feed My sheep," because our work in feeding the
   flock of God is the proof of love to the Lord. Do we not tell our
   people that love must be not in word, only, but also in deed? We judge
   whether any man has love to Christ by testing what he will do for
   Christ. What suffering or reproach will he endure for Him? What of his
   substance will he consecrate to His service? What of himself will he
   use for the Lord? We can tell which of us, as a minister, is proving
   his love to Christ by ascertaining who is really shepherding Christ's
   flock and laying out himself for the benefit of the Lord's redeemed.
   The man to whom Jesus said, "Do you love Me?" was the same who before
   had said "Lord, if it is You, bid me come unto You on the water." Some
   among us would readily venture upon that water-walking, for it would be
   something extraordinary and brief, and this would suit us, for we are
   not given to plodding perseverance. Our zeal is great and we dash off
   as Peter did, though soon, like he, we begin to sink! Note well that
   Christ does not say, "Simon, son of Jonas, do you love Me? Go and walk
   the water." The Master seems to say, "You have done enough of that in
   your young days, now go and quietly feed My sheep. It is hard, tiring,
   quiet work--and if you have no love to Me, you will soon weary of it.
   'Feed My sheep,' 'Feed My sheep,' 'Feed My sheep.' Three times I bid
   you do it, that you may continue in the work as long as you live, for
   thus will you have given proof of the reality of your affection for
   Me." Brothers, go back to your flocks and feed them well, and so give
   fresh evidences of your love to your Lord!

   This pastoral work for Christ is the craving of love in every heart
   that is set apart for the Lord. Every soul that truly loves Him longs
   to do something for Him. It cannot do otherwise--love must serve its
   Beloved--it yearns to go and lay its offering at His feet! No pressure
   was needed to make the forgiven sinner wash Christ's feet with her
   tears, wipe them with the hairs of her head and anoint them with
   precious ointment. Her heart suggested it and she hastened to obey. And
   if you, my Brothers, are true pastors, you cannot help looking after
   the wandering sheep. You naturally care for your people. You have a
   sacred instinct which compels you to be lovers of men's souls. You see
   how little girls, as if it were naturally in them to act as nurses,
   will kiss their dolls and fondle, caress, dress and care for them as
   mothers do for their children--and just so we have seen mere lads
   converted to Christ and intended by the Lord to become pastors, who,
   before they have been out of their teens, have begun to speak of Jesus
   to their little friends and companions. The Lord has caused them even
   from their new birth to feel a shepherd's propensities strong within
   them! It was so with some of us-- we could not have helped preaching
   even if we could--we were born to preach when we were born-again! Let
   us, then, indulge the sacred passion to the fullest!

   Brothers, since we have been at this work, it has been to us the
   stimulus of love. The way to love another more is to do more for Him.
   When a man has done a kindness to you, he will love you--the receiver
   may be unmindful of the favor, but the giver has a better memory! There
   is no fear of our Lord's ceasing to love us, since for us He has
   suffered even unto death! The supreme Sacrifice made once for all
   renders it impossible that He should do otherwise than rest in His
   love. Even so, if we labor and pray, and practice self-denial for
   others, we are sure to love them all the more. Then, too, as you

   go on feeding Christ's sheep, building up His people and cheering His
   discouraged ones, you will love your Master more--and your love for Him
   will act again upon you and cause increased love to the people--and so
   on evermore! Those over whom you have most agonized have delighted you
   most when at last they have been converted. Your joy has been increased
   as you have waited for the realization of your hope!

   This feeding of the sheep is to the love which is the matter in
   question, a sphere of communion. "Feed My sheep" unites us in service
   with Jesus. Love longs to be with Jesus and in fellowship with Him. The
   Lord was about to ascend to Heaven when He said to Simon, "Feed My
   sheep," and Simon could not as yet go with Him. But if he would
   accompany his Lord while abiding here, he must follow on his Lord's
   work and abide with his Lord's flocks. If we will undertake labors of
   love for those whom He has redeemed. If we will go wherever His sheep
   are lost, seeking--

   "With cries, entreaties, tears, to save, To snatch them from the fiery
   wave"-- we shall soon find ourselves where Jesus is! He is always at
   that business. He still seeks poor sinners and if we are engaged in the
   same search, we shall be with Him--we shall enter into His feelings, we
   shall share His desires and feel His sympathies! When thus with Him, we
   shall witness His heart-breaking throes and almost see His bloody sweat
   streaming down when He was agonizing for souls, for we shall in some
   feeble measure feel the same! You cannot understand your Lord till you
   have wept over your congregations! You will understand Him then, as you
   see Him weeping over Jerusalem. If you feel towards your hearers that
   you could die to save their souls, you will then have fellowship with
   the death of your Lord. In grief over backsliders and joy over
   penitents you will commune with the Redeemer in the most practical
   manner. You must feel a shepherd's feelings and give practical proof of
   it by daily feeding the flock--otherwise your fellowship with the Great
   Shepherd be will mere sentiment and not fact.

   So much about the previous examination of the candidate for the
   pastorate. But it is worth noting that the examination is often needed
   in later life, for we need to be keptright as well as to be madeso. Our
   Lord comes to us, this morning, with the old question. He pauses at
   each man and questions Him just as at the first. He seems to say, "You
   have read many men's books, do you still love Me? You have heard many
   conflicting opinions, do you still love Me? You have been very poor and
   worked, do you still love Me? Your people have treated some of you very
   badly, you have had to go from place to place, you have been slandered,
   reviled, maligned--do you still love Me? You have been sorely put to it
   to find sermons. I have sometimes left you, as you thought, to make you
   acknowledge your weakness--do you still love Me?"

   Imagine that He changes His tone and says, "Simon, son of Jonas, you
   have not been all that you promised. You thought you would go to prison
   and to death with Me, and you never dreamed that you could have been so
   cold-hearted in My service as you have been--and have lived at so great
   a distance from Me as you have done. But do you still love Me? If so,
   remember that in going back to your ministry, you must gather renewed
   strength from renewed love! Love Me more and then feed My sheep." We
   rejoice as we listen to His gracious voice! And each one of us answers,
   "Lord, You know all things--You know that I love You--and by Your
   Grace, I wilfeed Your sheep."

   II. Secondly, let us LOOK AT THE PERSON EXAMINED IN RELATION TO THE
   WORK. Perhaps he may bear

   the same relation to you as he does to me. Painfully do I know myself
   to be a successor of one of the Apostles--not of Judas, I hope, but
   certainly of Peter. I could have wished that it had been John whom I
   had succeeded, but although it is only Peter, it is some consolation to
   know that he was also "an Apostle of Jesus Christ" notwithstanding his
   terrible fall.

   Why did the Savior examine Peter rather than any other? Because Peter
   was in peculiar need of a re-ordination. Had he not received it from
   his Lord, some would have asked in later days, "Was he really an
   Apostle?" And others would have replied, "He thrice denied his Master,
   surely he is not one of the twelve." We cannot help feeling that
   blindness has seized the church of Rome when she boasts of the
   commission to feed Christ's sheep having been given to the Apostle
   Peter, when, with half an eye anyone can see that our Lord addressed
   these words to Peter because at that time he was the leastof the
   twelve! He had denied his Master. The others had not and, therefore, he
   was the one concerning whose Apos-tleship distrust was most likely to
   arise! The sheep would in all probability have refused to recognize
   him--they might have said, "We cannot receive food at your hands, for
   we remember how you were frightened by a silly maid, how you denied
   your Lord and supported your denial with oaths and curses." Therefore,
   came the Voice to Peter, who needed it. If there is one with us now who
   feels like conscience-stricken Peter, let him hear the text! Dear
   Friend, if you have any doubt about your call, and even if there should
   be as grave cause for that doubt as there was in Peter's case, yet
   still, if

   you feel that you love the Lord, hear Him again commission you with,
   "Feed My sheep." In your present condition, which is rather that of the
   weeping penitent than of the assured Believer, it will be well to go to
   your work very steadily, for it will comfort you, deepen your piety and
   increase your faith.

   Our Lord called Peter to this work because it would be peculiarly
   beneficial to him. He knew how sincere his repentance was and how
   hearty was his grief on account of his great sin and, therefore, lest
   he should be overtaken with too much sorrow, He said to him, "Feed My
   sheep." If nothing had been spoken personally and especially to Peter,
   he might have mourned heavily, saying, "Alas, I denied my Master, I
   swore that I never knew Him." And when the Lord was gone up again into
   Glory, instead of standing up as he did on the day of Pentecost to
   preach that memorable sermon, he might have been found at home weeping.
   Instead of going up to the Temple with John at the hour of prayer, he
   might have stayed in his chamber and there mourned all day. Grief is
   best expelled by other thoughts. When you have been cast down, it is
   well when some important engagement has called off your attention from
   your trouble. And I think the compassionate Master raised Peter out of
   what might have grown into a morbid condition of continual grief by
   bidding him feed His sheep. He seemed to say, "Come here, My dear
   disciple. I know you are sincerely penitent, and I have fully forgiven
   you for denying Me as you did. Mourn no longer, but go and feed My
   sheep." Then, as the Lord fed the sheep by him and blessed him to the
   conversion of others, he would feel certain that his Lord did not
   remember his faults--and thus he would learn how perfect was the pardon
   he had received! I do not know that there is a Brother with us, this
   morning, who is in the condition of Peter, but if I did know such an
   one and could read his heart, I would go out to him and say, "Come,
   Brother, we are not going to cast you out--we consider ourselves lest
   we, also, be tempted. You have been converted, once, as a sinner--you
   must now be converted as a minister. And when you are converted,
   strengthen your Brothers. Yes, my Brother, go back to your Lord and
   Master and then, with all your soul inflamed with love for Him, feed
   His sheep and the Lord bless you in so doing!"

   Dear Brothers, in Peter's case we see a man zealous for his Lord, but
   of imperfect character. And we see how his failure had been overruled
   by God to prepare him for his life-work of feeding Christ's sheep. John
   did not need such preparation and the other nine did not require it. It
   was only Peter who needed to be thus rebuked by a display of his own
   weakness. This man was too great, too self-confident, too much Peter
   and too little a disciple--and he must, therefore, come down. Probably
   nothing could have brought him to his true bearings like his being left
   to see what was in his heart. We speak with bated breath when we say
   that to some men, a painful break-down has been the making of them.
   They became, from that time, free from their former self-esteem and
   were as cleansed and emptied vessels--fit for the Master's use! A deep
   sense of our weakness and a humbling consciousness of unworthiness form
   a considerable part of our qualification for dealing with Christ's
   sheep. Because you are a sinner, you will deal lovingly with sinners.
   Because you know what backsliding means, you will be very gentle and
   forbearing with backsliders. Because you have broken your own bones,
   you will be very careful how you handle those who have broken theirs.

   You see, then, that this feeding of the sheep, as I have already shown
   you, would benefit Peter in the particular condition in which he then
   was. And it is not hard to see that it would benefit him by keeping his
   rashness in check. I know some beloved Brothers who are impetuous and,
   God bless them, I love them none the less for that, especially when
   they know how to bridle their impetuous spirits and only allow them to
   dash out against evil! But some are rashly impetuous and
   strong-headed--and it will need considerable discipline to make them
   into useful, workable men. But when the Lord has done this, they will
   become those determined, independent, resolute men of mark and mind who
   are so valuable to the Church of God! Such Brothers need the education
   of a pastorate to curb and to develop them. You did not know how
   foolish you were till you had to deal with fools and found that you
   could not suffer them gladly. You did not know how passionate you could
   be till you had to meet with quick-tempered people like yourself! You
   did not know how rash you could be till you fell into the society of a
   dozen rash men like yourself who egged you on in your fool-hardiness.
   You have now discovered that where you fancied there was a great deal
   of strength, there was a vast amount of weakness! I believe that the
   Peter of the Epistles grew out of the Peter of the Sea of Tiberias and
   the Peter of the denial, by means of the Grace given him while feeding
   the flock of God. Peter was a bigoted, narrow-minded Jew--he could not
   readily believe that any others beyond the chosen nation were to be
   saved! But when he mixed with mankind and was sent to the house of
   Cornelius, his heart grew larger, although it was not as large as it
   should have been till Paul boldly withstood him to his

   face because he was to be blamed! "Feed My sheep" is, therefore,
   Beloved, a commission intended for your own good as well as theirs.

   It touched me very much to find our Lord addressing Peter by his old
   name of Simon, son of Jonas. I do not know why He should not have said,
   "Peter, do you love Me?" John writes, "Jesus said to Simon Peter." Why
   did not our Lord call him so? Was it not, in the first place, to remind
   him of his natural weakness? He is not called Petros, the stone, the
   rock--but the son of Jonas, the son of a timid dove--and it is under
   that name that he is commissioned to feed the sheep. Brothers, if this
   morning you are filled with a consciousness of your own weakness and
   unworthiness, the Master says to you, "Still go and feed My sheep." If
   you are not, in your own opinion, fit for the work, still let the sheep
   be fed! Do not let them suffer because you are not in a right state of
   mind and heart. These sheep--what have they done? Why should they
   starve? It is only too true that you have sinned, but let not that sad
   fact rob the people of a full display of the Gospel next Lord's-Day.
   "Feed My sheep." Go as Peter, if you can, but when you cannot do so, go
   as, "Simon, son of Jonas."

   But I think there was a deeper reason and one which touched me more,
   why our Lord said, "Simon, son of Jonas, do you love Me?" This was his
   old name before he was converted, for when Jesus first saw him, He
   said, 'You are Simon, the son of Jonas.' Nothing will help you to feed
   the flock of God, Brothers, like recollecting the time and
   circumstances when you were first brought to Jesus. If it were
   possible, which it is not, I would like to be converted every Sunday
   morning before preaching. At any rate, I would like to feel that
   tenderness of heart, that admiration for my Savior, that all-absorbing
   love to my Lord--and that wonderment at the Grace of God toward me
   which I felt when I was converted!

   There may have been another reason why Jesus said, "Simon, son of
   Jonas, do you love Me?" Perhaps it was because when Simon had
   discovered that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, his
   Master said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona; for flesh and
   blood has not revealed this unto you, but My Father which is in
   Heaven." By repeating that name, our Lord made Peter remember, in
   addition to his conversion, the many happy seasons which he had enjoyed
   in which the Lord had manifested Himself to him as He does not unto the
   world. We are bound to preach of the things which we have tasted and
   handled. If, like John, we have been in Patmos, let us not cease to
   talk of Him that walks among the golden candlesticks. Come down from
   the mountain to tell of what you have seen there. Be filled with
   recollections of all the blessed communion you have enjoyed with Christ
   and then speak about Him to others--thus the joy of the Lord shall be
   your strength. You will then have no doubt of your call to the
   ministry, but you will say, "that which was from the beginning, which
   we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands
   have handled, of the Word of Life, declare we unto you." "We speak what
   we know and testify what we have seen."

   III. In the third place, I must confine myself to giving you a mere
   outline of THE WORK ITSELF, as our time is flying so fast. What have we
   to do, then? "Feed My sheep." In the English, you have the command
   three times over, "FeedMysheep." What are we to do with the sheep?
   Feed! Feed! Feed That seems to be the whole of our business, '"Feed My
   sheep." Truth to tell, the middle Greek word properly means shepherd
   them, guide them, lead them, go before them as a shepherd does. The
   first and last words are the same, feed. In each of the three sentences
   there is a minute difference, but twice out of three times in the
   original, the word is feed. If I mention nothing else but feeding as
   the pastor's duty, it will be the very best lesson I could have given
   you, even if other valuable duties are cast into the shade. Wherever
   you are weak, be strong in the pulpit! Give the people a good hearty
   meal whenever you preach! They will put up with a great many defects if
   you will only feed them. An Englishman is in a good condition if he is
   fed. Feed him and he will be all right. But if you dress him and do not
   feed him, he will not care for the clothes you put on him, however fine
   they are. You may wash him if you like, but you must feed him! There is
   an inward, powerful persuader which convinces a man that to be happy
   and healthy, he must be fed!

   Now, God's people are the hungriest people in the world--they never
   seem to be satisfied! If you watch a flock of sheep feeding in a clover
   field, you will be surprised to see how they will eat. They eat, and
   eat, and eat--and so God's people are a hungering, craving people. It
   is written, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
   righteousness: for they shall be filled." They, "shall be filled." It
   does not say they shall have a nip and a bite, and then be driven away
   and, therefore, we are to treat them as God would have them
   treated--feed them, feed them to the fullest! Never be afraid of being
   too free with the food, or of giving them too much sound Doctrine and
   Gospel food!

   Some want to drive the flock, but that will never do. We must feed, not
   drive. We will leadthem, you say--that is very good but do not lead
   lean sheep--feed and fatten them, and then they will gladly follow!
   Perhaps you wish to govern them. Well, the middle word does mean govern
   after the Gospel fashion, but if you somewhat govern, yet give two
   supplies of feeding for one of ruling! You will be sure to succeed if
   you keep to the feeding. Blessed be God, you have not to invent a new
   food for His sheep! It is written, "Feed them," but it is not written,
   "invent food for them." God has appointed the proper food for His
   sheep--hand that out to them--and nothing else. The Pope of Rome, who
   claims to be the lineal successor of the Apostle of whom we are
   speaking, attempts to feed in a strange manner. I wonder how many of
   the sheep are able to feed on his allocutions and other specimens of
   cursing. He seems to be mainly engaged in uttering maledictions upon
   the wolves! I see no food for the sheep. How is it that he has founded
   no Bible Societies in Rome for the circulation of the pure Word of God?
   One of his predecessors has called the Protestant version, "poisonous
   pastures." Very well, then, why not circulate a pure version? Why not
   spend a part of Peter's pence in distributing the Epistle to the
   Romans? Why not exhort priests, cardinals and bishops to be instant in
   season and out of season, preaching the Gospel according to the
   commission of the Lord? Verily, Peter at this day is crucified head
   downwards at Rome! The tradition is symbolic of the fact, for the
   Apostle is placed in a wrong position and exalted to honors which are a
   crucifixion to him.

   Brethren, you have to fedChrist's sheep. Our Lord says, "Feed! Feed!
   Feed!" He begins with, "Feed My lambs." My little lambkins, or young
   Believers--these need plenty of instruction. "Feed My sheep" comes
   next. Feed the middle-aged, the strong, the vigorous--these do not
   require only feeding--they also need to be directed in their Christian
   course and to be guided to some field of earnest service for
   Christ--therefore shepherd them. Then in the last, "Feed My sheep," you
   have the gray-headed Believers in Christ. Do not try to govern these,
   but feed them! They may have far more prudence and they certainly have
   more experience than you have and, therefore, do not rule them, but
   remind them of the deep things of God and deal out to them an abundance
   of consoling Truths. There is that good old man. He is a father in
   Christ. He knew the Lord 50 years before you were born--he has some
   peculiarities and in them you must let him take his own course--but
   still feed him. His taste will appreciate solid meat. He knows a field
   of tender grass when he gets into it. Feed him, then, for his
   infirmities require it. Feed all classes, my Brothers--that is your
   main work--mind that you not only get good food for the sheep, but feed
   them with it!

   A farmer one day, after he had listened to a simple sermon which was
   the very opposite of what he generally heard, exclaimed, "O Lord, we
   bless you that the food was put into a low crib today, so that Your
   sheep could reach it!" Some Brothers put the food up so high that the
   poor sheep cannot possibly feed upon it. I have thought, as I have
   listened to our eloquent friends, that they imagined that our Lord had
   said, "Feed my giraffes." None but giraffes could reach the food when
   placed in so lofty a rack! Christ says, "Feed My sheep"--place the food
   among them. Put it close to them.

   Take care, also, that you feed yourselves. "Who rules over freemen
   should himself be free." We will alter the line into "Who feeds
   Christ's sheep should himself feed on Christ,." A preacher who is
   starved in soul will be likely to starve his hearers. Oh, fatten
   yourselves on Christ, dear Brothers! Ask to have the promise fulfilled,
   "I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and My people
   shall be satisfied with My goodness, says the Lord." May the Holy
   Spirit work this in you!

   Having fed them, your work should also comprehend all the rest that a
   shepherd does for his flock. Neglect none of these things. Go before
   them! Set them an example, encourage them and direct them in
   difficulty. Let your voice always be familiar to them. Carry the lamb
   in your bosom, gently lead those that are in circumstances of pain and
   peril, care for all the flock--be tender with any that may wander, seek
   after them--and bring them back!

   Now what does all this involve? Knowledge. You must "feed them with
   knowledge and understanding." Watchfulness. No shepherd can afford to
   slumber and at one part of the year he must be up all night, for the
   lambs are being born. When you have a lambing time on, or, in other
   words, a blessed revival, you will need to be especially watchful! And,
   as the wolf comes not only at lambing time, but at all other seasons,
   you should be always vigilant against him.

   One of the chief qualifications of a true pastor, and one that is not
   very common, is a great deal ofpatience. Perhaps you say, "These people
   are so sinful, and erring, and foolish." Yes, they are like sheep! And
   if they were not so, they would not need you or any other shepherd!
   Your calling would be abolished if all Christ's people were strong and
   able to instruct others. Be very patient with them, as a nurse is with
   the child committed to her to watch, and love, and teach. What an honor
   this office puts upon you! To belong to the College of Fishermen with
   Peter, James and John is a great honor. But the work of the pastor is
   still nobler. Well did they speak of old of shepherd-kings, for the
   shepherd's business is such as is worthy of a king! Indeed, amid his
   flock he is the truest of kings. What a line of shepherds can be traced
   right

   through the Word of God! Your business is one which the first martyr
   followed, for Abel was a keeper of sheep. Stand like he in the midst of
   your flock, ready to sacrifice life, itself, at God's altar! You are
   following the business of Jacob, who said to Laban, "In the day the
   drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from
   my eyes." Yours is the calling of Joseph, who even when exalted to a
   throne, was still "the shepherd and stone of Israel." Whatever your
   position may be, Brothers, be shepherds! You are following the trade of
   that noblest of woman born, I mean Moses, who kept the flock of Jethro,
   his father-in-law, in the desert and there beheld the bush on fire out
   of which God spoke with him. He who led the people like a flock all
   through the wilderness was ready like a true shepherd to lay down his
   life for the flock, even asking to have his name blotted out of God's
   Book if by that means they might live! You are following the occupation
   of the men after God's own heart! If a man in these days is after God's
   heart, let him be a shepherd of the flock. "He chose David, also, His
   servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: from following the ewes
   great with young He brought him to feed Jacob, His people, and Israel
   His inheritance."

   I hope, my Brothers, that like David, that in your youth you have slain
   both the lion and the bear, and that if an un-circumcised Philistine
   comes in your path, you will defy and destroy him in the name of the
   Lord! You are following the trade of God's only-begotten Son! The Lord
   had but one Son and He made a Shepherd of Him! Imitate that Good
   Shepherd of the sheep who loved them and laid down His life for them.
   Trust that Great Shepherd of the sheep, whom "the God of peace has
   brought again from the dead through the blood of the Everlasting
   Covenant" and, by-and-by you shall see the Chief Shepherd and "shall
   receive a crown of glory that fades not away."

   Never forget that it is Christ's sheep that you have to feed! Jesus
   said, "Feed My sheep." Many find fault with the churches of the present
   day--but the easiest work in the world is to find fault! My dear
   Brothers, bad as I know some of the Churches to be, I know no better
   people than God's people--and with all their faults I still love them!
   I find my choicest companions and my bosom friends among them! I love
   the gates of Zion, for--

   "There my best friends, my kindred dwell,

   There God my Savior reigns."

   I always feel, in reference to my own people, that if they can put up
   with me, I can very well put up with them. They are Christ's
   people--therefore love them and feel it to be an honor to do anything
   for those who belong to Jesus!

   Much honor lies in the fact that our Lord says to each of us
   personally, "Feed My sheep." I think that I see Him here among us. He
   of the pierced hands and the marred Countenance, with the crown of
   thorns about His brow stands in this hall and speaks to us. Or, if you
   will, with all His glories on, He comes among us! He looks on us all
   and even on me, my dear Brothers--and He says to each of us, "Do you
   see those poor tempted people? They are My sheep. I have loved them
   from before the foundation of the world. Will you feed them for Me? I
   have called them out of the world by victorious Grace, will you feed
   them for Me? I have provided abundant pasture for them, will you feed
   them for Me? I have bought them with My blood--behold the memorials of
   My purchase in My hands and My feet, My head and My side--will you feed
   them for Me? I have also loved you, and you love Me--will you feed My
   sheep for Me? I will feed you, will you feed them? Your bread shall be
   given you and your water shall be sure--will you feed My beloved ones
   for Me? I have gone to prepare a place for them in My own sweet
   pastures on the hilltops of Glory. Will you feed them till I come
   again? I will feed them through you by the Holy Spirit--will you be My
   instruments?"

   Do we not all reply, "Beloved Master, we think it our highest honor to
   be privileged thus and, cost us what it may, we will spend our lives in
   feeding Your sheep"? Brothers, say not much by way of a vow, but say
   much by way of prayer! Lord, help us all henceforth to feed Your sheep!
   Amen.

A Command and a Promise

   (No. 3212)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   19, 1863.

   "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you." James 4:8.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon, upon the same text, is #2795, Volume
   48--THE DOUBLE DRAWING NEAR.]

   NOTICE the sentences immediately preceding our text--"Resist the devil,
   and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and He will draw near to
   you." Wherever we are, we must come into contact with the unseen powers
   either for good or evil. Go where we may, we cannot shut ourselves away
   from them. If we could take the wings of the morning and fly to the
   uttermost parts of the earth, spiritual beings would still be all
   around us there. Doubtless there are many invisible spirits, good or
   evil, in our midst at this moment, and when we go forth to our homes,
   or tomorrow go to our business or other duties, they will still attend
   us--the evil spirits seeking to lead our souls astray and the holy
   angels carrying out their sacred commission--"to minister for them who
   shall be heirs of salvation."

   These spiritual beings are divided into two bands. One band is under
   the leadership of that great fallen spirit-- great, though fallen--who,
   by his masterly genius, has secured control over multitudes of other
   spirits who do his bidding and yield to his will with unquestioning
   obedience. You also may surrender yourself to him if you will--he is
   the god of this world, the prince of the power of the air--and you may,
   if you will, be his slave. You may be girded with his chains, you may
   serve in his servitude and you may earn the wage which he will pay you
   at the last, for, "the wages of sin is death." But, surely, the
   admonition of the practical Apostle James is a wise one and we shall do
   well to take heed to it and revolt from our old master! Let us break
   his bonds asunder and cast away his cords from us! In the name of Jesus
   let us resist the devil and he will flee from us. Jesus has a far
   greater host of spirits under his leadership than Satan has and, at His
   command, they shall keep us in all our ways, and bear us up in their
   hands lest we dash our feet against a stone. His legions are far
   mightier than those of the black Prince of Darkness and their services
   shall all be at our disposal, whenever we need them--as soon as we have
   renounced all allegiance to our former tyrant lord!

   Now, having noted the connection of our text, I am going to apply it to
   three classes of persons. First, to the Believer. Secondly, to the
   backslider. And then, last of all, to the unconverted.

   I. First, then, we have here, A MESSAGE TO THE BELIEVER. "Draw near to
   God, and He will draw near to you."

   In Scripture, drawing near has various meanings. First, it means, draw
   near to God in worship, in prayer and in praise. When the hen sees a
   hawk in the air hovering over her brood, she gives a peculiar warning
   cluck, calling her little ones to come to her while, at the same moment
   she, herself, draws near to them. In a far higher fashion, the voice of
   God calls you to Him, warning you of the danger that lurks all round
   you. And while you run to hide from peril beneath the shadow of His
   wings, He, on His part, runs to meet you as the forgiving father ran to
   meet his prodigal son. You draw near to Him in the fearfulness and
   feebleness of your supplication and He draws near to you in the
   faithfulness and al-mightiness of His everlasting love! I am afraid
   that we often pray as if our God were at a distance from us--this can
   never be prevailing prayer. I do not despise that prayer which is like
   shooting an arrow up to the Throne of God, but I love still better the
   prayer that grips the Angel of the Covenant, the prayer that stands
   foot to foot with Him and wrestles with Him until the breaking of the
   day, and even then cries, "I will not let You go, except You bless me."
   If you can draw

   near to your Lord in prayer like that, He will certainly draw near to
   you and you will be like a prince who has power to prevail with God and
   with men.

   Let me encourage you, dear Friends, who have been backward in your
   private prayer, or who have cried to Him as though He were a long way
   off--"Draw near to Him." There are no bounds set around this mount of
   Grace as there were around Mount Sinai. You may climb up to the place
   called Calvary and clasp to your bosom the Christ who there died upon
   the accursed tree, for He is your Brother, your Friend, your Savior,
   your All-in-All, if you are truly trusting Him! So to you I say, as
   Paul wrote to the Hebrews, "Let us, therefore, come boldly unto the
   Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in
   time of need." "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you." Come
   near to Him and you shall soon have an answer to your prayers!

   It is the same with praise, but I am afraid that often we do not really
   draw near to God when we are professing to praise Him. I know that,
   sometimes, when we are singing God's praises in our great assemblies
   here, we are drawn very near to the gates of Heaven. At such times I
   have felt as though I were swimming in an ocean of sacred delight! It
   should be so with everyact of worship--it should all draw us nearer to
   our God. There are times when we feel more closely drawn to Him in the
   closet of private prayer than in the public services of the sanctuary,
   but still, there is a special blessing attending united prayer and
   praise which is not to be realized elsewhere. I remember reading of a
   Jew who would not open a business in a certain town because there was
   no synagogue in it. I wish that Christians would always be as careful
   to settle down, if possible, in a place where they would not lack
   religious privileges, for prayer and praise, like the two wheels of the
   chariot which carried Jacob down to Joseph, bring us near to our
   Beloved Lord and Master! And He, at the same time, comes to meet us and
   draws near to us.

   But I find that in Scripture, the term, "Draw near to God," is often
   used in the sense of asking counsel of God. Thus the Israelites, when
   they were in perplexity or difficulty, consulted the priest and he,
   wearing the ephod and the breastplate with the mysterious Urim and
   Thummim, was able to interpret the will of God as it had been revealed
   to him. And now, though no sacred ephod or breastplate is worn by
   mortal man, though the ancient oracles are dumb and though no earthly
   prophet speaks infallibly according to the will of God, you may still
   draw near to God, Himself, in the name of Jesus Christ, His Son, and
   seek the guidance of His ever-blessed Spirit! I hope you will do so at
   every step of your life, for what step is there that is not important?
   Those that seem to us to be of the least significance may be the very
   ones that will the soonest lead us into mischief. But there are certain
   periods in our history when it is absolutely necessary that we should
   say to ourselves, "Let us consult the Lord about this matter." Many of
   you would never have been in the trouble in which you now are if you
   had but waited upon God before you took a certain course which has
   brought you nothing but sorrow. We heedlessly run before the
   fiery-cloudy pillar moves--and when we find that we have rushed into
   the waste howling wilderness, we lay the blame for our own folly at the
   door of God's Providence! Let it not be so with any of you, dear
   Friends. Let every morning's plans be spread out before the Lord to see
   whether they meet with His approval. And let every evening's joys and
   sorrows be brought to Him that He may show you how to glorify Him in
   all that happens to you! Solomon truly said, "He that trusts in his own
   heart is a fool." And David just as truly said, "But he that trusts in
   the Lord, mercy shall compass him about." You need never lack Divine
   guidance, for you can have it by asking for it! God is willing to guide
   you if you will only seek His guidance. See to it, then, that you
   practice the text in the sense of asking counsel of God--"Draw near to
   God, and He will draw near to you."

   There is a third meaning to the phrase, "Draw near to God." It is used
   in the sense of enjoying communion with God. There are some here who do
   not understand what I mean by communion with God. They are completely
   puzzled by the very simple language of the Apostle John, "Truly our
   fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son, Jesus Christ." There
   are hundreds and thousands of people constantly attending church or
   chapel who do not know the meaning of the word, "communion." If you
   were to ask them what they understand by it, they would probably say
   that it means eating a piece of bread and drinking a little wine at the
   Lord's Supper. And more than that, if they were to ask me to explain to
   them what true spiritual communion with God means, I would probably
   fail to make them comprehend it. Yet you who, by Grace, have been
   enabled to drink of these cooling streams, know well what that
   communion means! Some of you who have been the most deeply taught of
   the Spirit could sing through the whole Song of Solomon and see your
   Beloved in it all--while to others it is only an Eastern love song
   which is to them quite incomprehensible. You know Christ, not only by
   faith, but by a sort of second sense which makes Him very real to you.
   You have drawn near to Christ and talked with

   Him--and He has drawn near to you and talked with you--and He has been
   nearer to you and dearer to you than any earthly friend has ever been!
   Oh, what joy Believers know when they realize Christ's Presence! When
   His left hand is under their heads and His right hand embraces them!
   Talk of Heaven--such communion is Heaven begun below! When Heaven's
   gates are opened wide and the celestial sunshine comes streaming
   through, it falls upon the eyes that have been illuminated by the Holy
   Spirit--that is true spiritual communion--and the glorified spirits
   above do but know that bliss to the full in knowing God and rejoicing
   in the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

   Perhaps, my dear Brother, you have been reading Rutherford's letters
   and you have said to yourself. "Alas, I cannot hope to enjoy such
   communion with Christ as Rutherford enjoyed!" But why shouldn't you?
   Read our text again. "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you."
   You, my dear Sister, may have read the life of Madame Guyon and you
   have said, "What an angel in human form that woman must have been!" But
   if you draw near to God, you may have as much love to Christ as she
   had! And you may enjoy as much fellowship with Christ as she had, for,
   "He will draw near to you." You have envied Mary because she sat at
   Jesus' feet, or you have wished that you had been John, to lean your
   head upon your Master's bosom. Well, you may do both these things in a
   spiritual sense--and that is better than the carnal! "Draw near to God,
   and He will draw near to you." To you, even to you, the very feeblest
   of those who resist the devil, will God draw near if you draw near to
   Him!

   I think, however, that there is another meaning in our text, and that
   is, "draw near to God" in the general strain and tenor of your life. We
   all know that the sun, the great center of the solar system has several
   planets revolving around him. Some of them comparatively near, others
   at a greater distance, and some still more remote. And Jesus Christ,
   the great Sun of Righteousness, has His people revolving around Him as
   the planets circle round the sun! Some of them are very near the great
   central Luminary. Others are far away, at a vast distance from Him, and
   others are neither very near nor very far off, but somewhere between
   the two. There are some Believers who are like the planet Mercury. You
   do not often see that fast revolving planet because it keeps so near
   the sun that it is usually lost in his bright rays. So is it with some
   Christians--the world knows little of them--they make no noise as they
   move along in their appointed orbit and they keep so near to Christ
   that they seem to be absorbed into His radiance! Their thoughts are so
   much occupied with Christ, their heart's affection is so fully given to
   Him, that they do not talk much about earthly things. Their great
   desire is to live in close and hallowed fellowship with their Lord.
   There are others who are like the planets that are far away from the
   sun, yet some rays of light and heat reach even them. And those
   Believers who are living at a distance from Christ have some of the
   Divine Light and heat within them, but oh, so little compared with what
   they might have! Oh, that you who are so far off from God, would leave
   your distant orbits and draw near to Him--for then He would also draw
   near to you!

   You know, dear Friends, that there is almost as much difference between
   some Christians and others as there is between Christians and
   worldlings--I said, almost, for there is not quite the same difference,
   though there is nearly the same. There are heights of lofty
   consecration and of intimate communion with Christ to which some
   Believers have attained, but of which others have not yet even dreamed.
   There is an inner circle of fellowship into which only a few privileged
   saints have ever entered--these are the elect out of the elect who have
   been distinguished above all the rest of Christ's disciples by the
   loftier Grace which has been their peculiar characteristic. Oh, that we
   had many more such Christians in all our Churches! There are a few of
   them scattered about Christendom, like grains of salt, but we need many
   more of them--men who, like Moses, have their faces made to shine with
   a supernatural brightness because they have dwelt with God upon the
   mount of secret communion--men who are not afraid to die because they
   have looked without alarm into the face of God, through Jesus Christ
   their Lord--and men who have learned how to live as becomes the Gospel
   of Christ--and there is no higher life than that!

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, "draw near to God!" Press towards the
   highest degree of godliness that is possible for you to obtain! Seek to
   have the closest communion with Christ that mortals can ever know while
   here on earth. Do not be content to be in the outer courts, the
   lobbies, the ante-chambers of religion--strive to gain admission to the
   very Holy of Holies, itself, for that is where your Lord would have you
   to be! You know that there is a sort of border-land where many
   professors live, where a man is thought to be a Christian, but all the
   while he is not even half a Christian. He is counted among the saved,
   yet he lives on the very borders of damnation! And if at the last he
   issaved, we shall sorrowfully have to add, "yet so as by fire." In some
   respects he is a righteous man, as Lot was, yet, like Lot, he dwells in
   Sodom. He is in some ways a good man, as Noah was, yet, like he, he
   falls into shameful sin. Oh, that we could all rise above this wretched
   condition and live continually so close to Christ that men would take
   knowledge of us that we had been with Jesus, and had caught something
   of His spirit--and had been so changed by Grace that we were far more
   like He is than we now are!

   There I leave my text with the Believer. I would gladly draw you near
   to God, Beloved, by my words, if I could. But I know that He must,
   Himself, draw you by His Grace if the drawing is to be effectual. So
   let this be your prayer and resolve this very moment, "Draw us, and we
   will run after You."

   II. Now, in the second place, we have in our text AN ENTREATY TO THE
   BACKSLIDER. "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you." I must
   speak but briefly on this point, but I need to be as earnest as I am
   brief.

   So, Backslider, you have come in here, tonight. A friend who is up from
   the country persuaded you to accompany him, or you would probably not
   have been here, for you have almost given up going to a place of
   worship--you think there is no hope for you. Friend, do you know what
   your doom will be if you continue as you are now? Have you ever read
   the story of Judas? Do you know what became of Demas, Simon Magus,
   Alexander the coppersmith and others who turned aside from the faith in
   the days of the Apostles? Remember those terrible, yet Inspired words,
   "If we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth,
   there remains no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking
   for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the
   adversaries." It would have been better for you never to have had any
   knowledge of the Truth of God than to have known it and then sinned
   willfully against it, and so, after all, to be a castaway! If you are a
   true child of God, though a wanderer from His ways, you will be brought
   back to Him and I pray that you may be brought back to Him this very
   hour! But if you are an apostate, a backslider in heart, you will be
   filled with your own ways! Having filled up the measure of your
   iniquity, you will be driven from God's Presence into the place of woe
   where hope and mercy can never come!

   Yet listen to me, Backslider, this terrible sentence has not yet been
   pronounced on you. The voice of God still cries to you, "Draw near unto
   Me." Where are you flying, my Brother? Are you seeking to escape from
   God's righteous judgments? That is impossible, for His thunderbolts
   will soon overtake you and seal your eternal doom! Run not away from
   Him, but draw near to Him! Cast down your weapons of rebellion and fall
   prostrate before Him, seeking the forgiveness which He is willing and
   waiting to bestow upon you. Let me take you by the hand and try to
   encourage you to come near to the Lord this very moment. Do you ask,
   "How can I come near to Him?" Come just as you came to Him at the
   first! Perhaps you reply, "But I never really came to Him aright." Then
   come to Him aright right now! I came to Him as a sinner and He gave me
   a hearty welcome--and He will receive you just as graciously if you
   only come to Him with wholehearted repentance for your sin and true
   faith in Jesus Christ as your only Savior!

   But here is one who did run well, yet she has been hindered.
   Backsliding woman, remember that your God is married to you and that He
   bids you return to Him! Backsliding man, you have turned aside from
   your God, yet He still loves you and cries out to you, "Return, return,
   return!" The Lord still says, as He did in Jeremiah's day, "Return, you
   backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings." Oh, that you
   would reply even as they did--"Behold, we come unto You, for You are
   the Lord our God"! I am sure that you are not happy in your present
   condition. On the contrary, you are as sad and miserable as you can
   possibly be. This very House of Prayer reminds you of your former
   privileges and joys, of the days when you delighted in God and felt
   that you were, indeed, on your way to Heaven. You cannot be content to
   live in the far country among the swine that are not fit companions for
   you! Leave the husks to the pigs--they can never satisfy your hunger!
   Come back to your Father, poor prodigal! Though your clothes are in
   rags, though you are steeped in filth, though you have sinned most
   grievously, come back to your Father and He will receive you with open
   arms and open heart! I will not act towards you as the elder brother
   did to the prodigal, but I will welcome you as a Brother if you are,
   indeed, a Brother. But if you are not a Brother, you are a sinner--and
   "this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners," even the very chief! So,
   "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." Put your
   soul's affairs into His hands! ask Him to be your Advocate to plead
   your cause before the King! He never yet lost a case that was entrusted
   to Him--and He will not lose yours!

   III. I have almost anticipated the last division of my discourse, but I
   must close by giving from my text AN INVITATION TO THE UNCONVERTED.
   "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you."

   The great Gospel rings out again and the same note sounds to the sinner
   as to the saint--not that there is any implication in this text that
   the sinner can draw near to God by his own unaided power, or that he
   comes first, and God comes next, or that there is any natural
   willingness in the sinner to come to God. The text seems to me to show
   the difference between the Law and the Gospel. God even said to Moses,
   the chosen leader of His ancient people, "Draw not near here: take off
   your shoes, for the place where you stand is holy ground." But under
   the Gospel, God says to the sinner, "Draw near here. It is true that
   this is holy ground, but it is sprinkled with blood--the blood of My
   only-begotten and well-beloved Son. And if the blood is also sprinkled
   upon you, you may draw near and you cannot come too near, so come and
   welcome, Sinner, come!" If it were a question of merit, or of
   justification by the works of the Law, the sinner might well try to
   flee from the avenging hands of Divine Justice. But on the ground of
   Divine Love, and pity, and mercy, and free and Sovereign Grace, the
   sinner may draw near to God though he has nothing to recommend him! He
   may come just as he is and God, in mercy, will draw near to Him! Should
   there be here a swearer, a drunk, or one who has committed the foulest
   of sins--the text says to him in the sense in which I have explained
   it--"Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you." Sinner, if you
   repent of your sins and trust in Jesus as your Savior, God will not
   spurn you and drive you from Him, but He will draw near to you as you
   draw near to Him!

   Then, next, the text shows the sinner what God means to do for him. He
   means to draw the sinner near to Himself and then Himself to draw near
   to the sinner! This is done in two ways. It is done, first, by what
   Jesus did for us when He split the veil that separated us from God. And
   it is done, next, by what the Holy Spirit does in us when He splits the
   veil that hides God from us! There are, or were, these two veils--the
   veil that concealed the visible manifestation of God from men, which
   was torn asunder at the moment of Christ's death--and the veil that is
   over our own hearts which conceals God from us until the Holy Spirit
   takes it away and we see God in Christ Jesus reconciled to us by the
   death of His Son. I fear that there are even some in this congregation
   who are living just as if there were no God at all. If there really
   were no God, you would probably not be any different from what you are
   now. God is not in all your thoughts or if you ever do think of Him,
   you say, with the fool of whom the Psalmist tells us, "No God. No God
   for me. I need no God and, as far as I am concerned, there is no God."
   Well then, if you are ever to be saved, you will have to be brought
   near to God by a power altogether outside yourself! You will have to be
   made to feel that God is One whom you must love. You will be reconciled
   to Him by the death of His Son and your heart will be filled with love
   to Christ through the gracious influences of the Holy Spirit!

   The text further shows what God will lead the sinner to do for himself.
   Ungodly man, if you are ever to be saved, you must draw near to God in
   prayer! Go to Him at this moment, just where you are sitting, and
   confess all your sin to Him. There is no need for you to utter a word
   that any of us can hear, for God can read the language of your heart.
   Then you must draw near to Christ by faith. Just as that poor woman in
   the crowd touched the hem of His garment and was immediately made
   whole, so must you, by faith, get into contact with Christ! Trust in
   Him as your one and only Savior, and He will certainly save you! And
   this shall be the grand result of it all--you will draw near to God,
   and He will draw near to you. Oh, that you would now cry to Him, "God
   be merciful to me, a sinner." That will be drawing near to God in
   penitence and contrition and supplication--and He will draw near to you
   in gracious acceptance and blessing. And then one day He will call you
   to draw near to Him in Heaven, itself, to sit at His table in Glory, to
   feast with Him in His Kingdom! Then shall you, even you, wear a crown,
   and wave a palm and forever adore that matchless Grace which first drew
   you near to Him--and then draw near to you!

   If there is one here who will go home to pray, "Draw me near, O God!"
   Or better still, if there is one anywhere in this vast throng, whose
   heart is praying, "Lord, save me! Draw me with the cords of a man,
   (even the Man, Christ Jesus, the Friend of sinful man), with the bands
   of love. O God, draw near to me, for I would gladly draw near to You!"
   If there is one here whose eyes have in them the tears of penitence, I
   point that one to Jesus, hanging on the Cross, and say--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One!

   There is life at this moment for thee.

   Then look, Sinner--look unto Him and be saved--

   Unto Him who was nailed to the tree!" Remember that the Son of God, the
   Lord of Life and Glory, suffered indescribable shame and ignominy and,
   at last, death, itself, for sinners--for every sinner who trusts in His
   great atoning Sacrifice! If you are trusting in Him, that is

   proof positive that He dried for you, died in your place, died that you
   should never die, for He bore all the punishment that your sin
   deserved, so there is none left for you to bear! He drank to the last
   dregs the cup of wrath that was your due, so there is not one drop left
   for you to drink! He suffered all that could ever have been your
   portion even in Hell, itself, for being Infinite, there was no limit to
   His agonies. And now, for you, there is no Hell, no torment, no
   condemnation! You may know assuredly whether Christ died for you or
   not--do you trust Him? Will you trust Him now? Will you say--

   "Just as I am--and waiting not

   To rid my soul of one dark blot.

   To You, whose blood can cleanse each spot,

   O Lamb of God, I come"?

   If You have said that from your heart, you are now a saved soul and you
   may go to your home rejoicing in the Lord, for your sins, which were
   many, are all forgiven and you are on your way to Heaven! God grant
   that it may be so, for Jesus Christ's sake!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JAMES 1.

   Verse 1. James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
   twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greet-ings.The Apostle James
   evidently believed in no lost ten tribes, as some, nowadays, do. They
   were never lost--the Israelites whom we see nearly every day belong to
   some of all the 12 tribes, so James addressed his Epistle, "to the
   twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greetings."

   2. My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations.
   Or, trials. [See Sermon #1074, Volume 29--all joy in all

   TRIALS.]

   3-5. Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience. But
   let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire,
   wanting nothing. If any of you lack wisdom. That is just what most of
   us lack--"If any of you lack wisdom"--

   5. Let him ask of God. That is the short road to true knowledge--to
   pray. Study is good, no doubt, for the acquisition of knowledge. But
   praying is the best way to obtain true wisdom!

   5, 6. Who gives to all men liberally, and upbraids not; and it shall be
   given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing unwavering.For the very
   essence of prayer lies in believing that God can and will give us the
   things which we seek at His hands.

   6. For he that wavers.The man who does not know whether prayer will
   succeed or not--

   6. Is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. [See
   Sermon #2537, Volume 43--A warning to waverers.] You can never tell
   what will become of the wave. It goes just

   where it is driven--and there are many men who can be good, after a
   certain fashion, if they are in good company--but they can be just as
   bad if the wind blows from another quarter! But if we have true faith
   in God and true faith in prayer, we shall not be "like a wave of the
   sea driven with the wind and tossed."

   7. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the
   Lord. What the wild waves are saying, we know not. So is it with a man
   who is "like a wave of the sea." He utters words without meaning and
   his prayer dies away like the roar of the billows upon the shore when
   the fury of the storm has abated. "Let not that man think that he shall
   receive anything of the Lord."

   8. A double-minded man. A man with two minds--a mind to the religious
   and another mind to enjoy the pleasures of the world--such a man--

   8. Is unstable in all his ways.There is nothing solid or substantial
   about him, nothing enduring. You cannot rely on him, for he is blown
   here and there, as chaff flies before the wind.

   9. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted. For the
   Gospel lifts him up out of his poverty and makes him a child of God who
   is spiritually rich, even though he is poor in temporal things.

   10. But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the
   grass, he shall pass away. Let him not, therefore, rely upon his wealth
   as though it were anything but a trust and a burden laid upon him, for
   he will have to leave it and

   he, himself, "as the flower of the grass, shall pass away" Let him
   rejoice to get down to the Rock of Ages! Let him lay hold of eternal
   things as if he had nothing else in which he could trust!

   11, 12. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
   withers the grass, and the flo wer falls and the beauty of the fashion
   of it perishes; so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
   Blessed is the man that endures temptation. [See Sermon #1874, Volume
   31--A DISCOURSE UPON TRUE BLESSEDNESS HERE AND HEREAFTER.] Or, trial.
   The man that holds on and holds out under it and does not give way
   under it--blessed is the man that is tried--

   12, 13. For when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which
   the Lord has promised to them that love Him. Let no man say, when he is
   tempted, I am tempted of God. Here we must take the word, "tempted," in
   its dark meaning, for the Scriptural word, "temptation," means two very
   different things. When we are drawn towards evil, that is the black
   meaning of the word, "temptation." But when we are tested or tried in
   order that it may seen that the good in us is real--that is the bright
   meaning of the word, "temptation." In that sense, God did tempt (try or
   test) Abraham, but not in the other sense.

   13-15. For God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts He any man:
   but every man is tempted when he is drawn of his own lust, and enticed.
   Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is
   finished, brings forth death.There is the parentage and the progeny of
   sin. Sin comes of unbridled desire. A man feels that he must have a
   certain thing--right or wrong--he is determined to have it. Then there
   comes of that determination the overt act of sin! And what comes of
   that? Why, death--for every sin, in its measure, helps to kill us--to
   destroy that which is the real life of our manhood. Every sin is a drop
   of poison. There are sweets that are poisonous and the pleasures of sin
   are of this kind. And leave the poison of sin alone, let it work in its
   natural way and it will bring forth death! That man, therefore, who
   lives in sin and loves it, has nothing before him but everlasting
   death! He may well tremble!

   16, 17. Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every
   perfect gift is from above. It never comes from within our own hearts!
   It does not even come by imitation of better men--it must come from
   God.

   17. And comes down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no
   variableness, neither shadow of turning. As every sunbeam comes from
   the sun, so all Grace and virtue must come from God with whom there is
   neither parallax nor tropic, as there is with the natural sun. He never
   declines, He never varies--He is always the same. Now, in proof that
   everything in us comes from God, James says that our very spiritual
   life comes from God.

   18. Of His own will begat He us with the word of truth, that we should
   be a kind of first fruits of His creatures. True Believers have been
   twice created. The second time we were begotten, again, by the Word of
   God that became the living seed within our spirits--out of which the
   new life grew--and now we are "a kind of first fruits of His
   creatures." Just as the first ears of ripe corn were brought into the
   sanctuary and dedicated to God, so are all true Believers consecrated
   persons, the "first fruits of His creatures."

   19, 20. Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear,
   slow to speak, slow to wrath, for the wrath of man works not the
   righteousness of God.We never do much for the Truth of God or goodness
   by getting angry about it. Whenever a man debates about the Truth of
   God and loses his temper, he has also lost his cause! I have heard of
   one who knew little of true religion, who watched a missionary and a
   Brahmin disputing. And he decided that the missionary was in the right.
   When he was asked why he thought so, he said, "Because he kept his
   cool, and the other man flew into a passion." Although that may not
   always be a good test of the truth of the matter in question, it
   certainly is a good test of how the dispute is going!

   21. Therefore, lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,
   and receive with meekness the engrafted Word,

   which is able to save your souk. [See Sermon #1847, Volume 31--BEFORE
   SERMON, AT SERMON AND AFTER SERMON--Read/download the entire sermon,
   free of charge, at http://www.spurgeongems.orgj That evil branch is cut
   away--now be ready to have a branch of a better kind inserted into you,
   even "the engrafted Word, which is able to save your souls"--that you
   may bring forth better fruit than the old crabbed stock of Nature can
   possibly yield!

   22-26. But be you doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving
   yourselves. For if any is a hearer of the Word, and not a doer, he is
   like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: for he beholds
   himself, and goes his way, and straightway forgets what manner of man
   he was. But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and
   continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
   work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. [See Sermons #1467-b,

   man among you seems to be religious, but bridles not his tongue and
   deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain. That which is in
   the well will come up in the bucket, and that which is in the heart
   will come up on the tongue. An unbridled tongue denotes an unrenewed
   heart. Oh, that God would always give us Grace in our heart to move our
   tongue aright! Then, as the water guides the whole ship, our tongue
   will guide our whole body and the whole of our manhood will be under
   holy government and control.

   27. Pure and undefled religion before God and the Father is this, To
   visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
   himself unspotted from the world. [See Sermon #2313, Volume 39--CHARITY

   means--tenderness to others and tenderness of conscience in ourselves!
   How much Divine Grace we need in order that these two virtues may shine
   brightly within us!

Blessings Traced to Their Source

   (No. 3213)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "All my springs are in You." Psalm 87:7.

   It does one good to think that there are such things in the world as
   springs bubbling up in the shady nooks. Places of sweet refreshment in
   this dusty earth. The mouth waters at the very thought of the palms of
   Elim and the wells there. If even to us fresh springs are a blessing,
   much more must they have been so to the Psalmist who lived in a dry and
   thirsty land which owed almost all its fertility to irrigation. Nothing
   is more precious to the Oriental than a well. And he who finds a spring
   of water counts himself a much happier man than he who has found a vein
   of precious metal. We must, therefore, transfer the thought of precious
   water springing up copiously, bubbling up with living force, to our
   spiritual condition--and then say with David, "All my springs are in
   You." That is to say, we trace all the mercies we receive to their
   fountainhead! The Psalmist was grateful for the blessings that were
   conferred upon him. He did not receive them with selfish inattention
   but, considering them well, he found that every good gift and every
   perfect gift came from his God. He had learned that not only everything
   good around him, but everything that was within him that was good came
   from the same source! And discovering within himself a living power, a
   living well of water within his own nature, he traced that, also, to
   the Grace of God--and said, "All my springs are in You."

   Did he not mean, first, "all the springs I drink of are in You"
   Secondly, did he not mean, "All the springs within myself come from
   You" I do not know that those two heads comprise even one-tenth of the
   thoughts that might arise out of our text, but then we have not time to
   take such a great text as this and consider it in full. We shall,
   therefore, just take the two series of thoughts that will spring up
   under those heads.

   I. The first thought is, ALL THE SPRINGS I DRINK OF ARE IN YOU.

   To begin, he may have remembered the deep which lies under In the
   benediction upon Joseph, Moses said that he was to have the blessing of
   the deep which couches beneath. Deep down in the earth are vast
   reservoirs of water and when these are tapped, they spring up and we
   are refreshed by them. These are symbolical of the mighty fountains of
   Eternal Love, the electing Grace of God, the Infinite fullness of the
   heart of God in His own Nature, for, "His nature and His name are
   Love." When we get to the great fountains of the Infinite, Eternal,
   Immutable Love of the Father towards His chosen people, then, indeed,
   we come to the fountainhead of all the streams which make the people of
   God glad! There is not a blessing we receive but it may be traced to
   the eternal purpose of God! We may see, on every single benediction of
   the Covenant, the stamp of the eternal purpose and decree--

   "The streams of love I trace

   Up to the Fountain, God.

   And in His mighty breast I see

   Eternal thoughts of love to me." Every Christian who is rightly taught,
   who understands the Word of God and is not afraid of the fullness of
   the Truth of God, will ascribe all the springs of Grace that he ever
   drinks of, to the eternal Fountain. God said to Job, "Have you entered
   into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the search of the
   depth?" This is a mysterious subject and we cannot find these secret
   springs, but yet we know that they are there. We rejoice in them and
   bless the Lord for them!

   But, using only illustrations from Scripture, when the Psalmist said,
   "All my fresh springs are in You"--for that is the force of the
   expression he uses--may he not have thought of that Rock from which the
   living water leaped in the wil-derness,so that all the multitude that
   were in the desert drank of the stream? Those who had true knowledge of
   God also drank of that spiritual Rock which followed them and we know
   that, "that Rock was Christ." That Rock, too, was

   struck and, straightway it became a spring of water for all the tribes,
   even as our smitten Savior has now become the Spring from which all of
   us drink. So I may say--

   "Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

   You my sacred Fount shall be." We find, leaping from the cleft in His
   side, the cleansing blood and the refreshing water, too. As I said at
   first, that we may trace all our blessings to electinglove, I may now
   say with equal truthfulness, that we may trace them all to
   redeem-inglove. There is a crimson mark on every blessing of the
   Covenant!--

   "There's never a gift His hand bestows

   But cost His heart a groan."

   That is a most sure and precious Truth of God! As we look to our dear
   Lord upon the Cross and see Him also exalted in His Glory, remembering
   that "it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell," and
   that of His fullness have all we received, and Grace for Grace," we can
   truly say to Him, "Emmanuel, all my springs are in You."

   We meet, in Holy Scripture, with another illustration. In the times of
   Abraham there were certain wells which he dug, the possession of which
   were disputed by the Philistines. And when Isaac afterwards had to go
   into Philistia, he found that the wells which Abraham had dug had been
   filled up by the Philistines. He therefore dug others and when the
   Philistines began to argue with his herdsmen, he moved on further and
   dug another well--and the Philistines strove again for that. He moved
   again, for he was a peaceful man, and found they strove for that--it
   seemed as if he could have no water without having to contend for it.

   Sometimes the wells of which we drink are springs concerning which
   there is grave contention. There are some that deny the most precious
   Doctrines of the Gospel. There is a sound of the shooting of archers at
   the place of the drawing of water. And when a poor, simple child of God
   would come and let down his bucket and take a draught, he finds the
   bowman's shaft flying past his ears! Somebody has discovered that one
   Doctrine is not Scriptural, and that another Doctrine is not rational,
   so the thirsty soul becomes afraid to drink of that well! What is
   worse, if there should not be any controversy about the Truth, itself,
   he will find a controversy in his own soul as to his right to
   appropriate it. Satan, the accuser of the brethren, will remind him of
   his faults, will tell him he can have no part or lot in the matter, or
   else he would not be what he is. They who are delivered from the noise
   of the archers in the place, of drawing water shall, bless the name of
   the Lord as they drink!

   And truly, Brothers and Sisters, if we did but always remember that all
   our mercies come from God--hat whatever logic may insist upon, it must
   be true that salvation is of the Lord--that whichever ism may be right,
   whichever side of controversy may have made an accurate statement, it
   must be correct that every good gift comes from "the Father of lights,
   with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning"--then we would
   find that, let the enemy contest as he will, we have access to the
   refreshing stream! Since all the springs worth drinking are in God our
   Father and Christ our Redeemer, we can come to these and drink without
   fear, for God is ours, Christ is ours and, therefore, every Covenant
   blessing is ours, too! Therefore, laying aside all disputing and
   contention, we come and drink of these wells because they are in God
   and in Christ our Savior!

   We read, in the Book of Judges, of two springs of water. You often
   mention them in prayer. Indeed, they are a kind of proverb in the
   Christian Church. There were the upper springs and the nether springs.
   Now every child of God who judges rightly knows that the nether springs
   are in his God. I mean his lower comforts, his temporal mercies. What
   would we have of earthly good worth enjoying if God did not give it to
   us? If you get wealth, who gives you power to get it? And if you have
   health, who is it that preserves your strength of limb and the blood
   that still leaps within your veins? He has but to will it and you would
   be a paralytic, or a consumptive like so many others. Your children are
   spared to you--bless God for each of them, for it is He that spares
   them! Your husband or your wife, your brother or your sister, the joys
   that cluster around the hearth--all these come to you through Him. They
   are common mercies, we say, but we would not think them so common if we
   had to miss them for a while! Let us bless God and see His hand in them
   all, and say, "Great Father, even my nether springs are in You."

   But when we come to the thought of the upper springs, we have no
   question connecting them. If we possess eternal life, God gave it to
   us. If we believe in Jesus, faith is not a flower that ever springs
   from the natural soil of man's heart. If we have repentance unto life,
   it is the work of the Spirit of God. If we have been kept until now,
   faithful to our profession, we have nothing of which we can glory--we
   would have gone back from it if God had not preserved us. We have not
   had one single jot of anything from the first day until now, but we
   have derived it from the Lord's Infinite Mercy! All our upper springs
   are in Him--shall we not bless His name? And while we say, "Spring up,
   O well," shall we not also

   add, "Sing you unto it," and bless and magnify that perennial Fountain
   of Mercy which perpetually flows to us? The old classical poets went to
   Helicon for their inspiration--they drank of that spring upon Mount
   Parnassus. But as for us, we will say, with that poetess of the
   sanctuary--

   "Come, You Fount of every blessing,

   Tune my heart to sing Your Grace,

   Streams of mercy, never ceasing

   Call for songs of loudest praise." We have no Parnassus, but we have a
   better Mountain--

   "Teach me some melodious sonnet,

   Sung by flaming tongues above!

   Praise the Mount--oh, fix me on it,

   Mount of God's unchanging love!" From this source will we derive the
   inspiration of our muse. Here shall we find the burden of our song. The
   upper and the nether springs come alike from God--yes, "All my springs
   are in You."

   You may read, if you turn to the 104th Psalm, of the springs that flow
   into the valleys. They are the places for springs where the wild beasts
   come to drink, and each of them does quench his thirst. And where the
   birds sing among the branches. You and I have had our valley mercies.
   We have been humiliated, perhaps, and we have sung with the shepherd's
   boy in the Valley of Humiliation--

   "He that is down needs fear no fall.

   He that is low, no pride.

   He that is humble, ever shall

   Have God to be his Guide."

   We have been in the Valley of Baca and made it a well--and the rain has
   filled the pools. We have been in the Valley of Fellowship with Christ,
   walking along the cool vale of communion with our Father who is in
   Heaven--and behold, it has been a place of springs--of springs full of
   water! There is not one joy in our best and happiest time but comes
   from God. In our choicest moments, when we are most like our Lord and
   most free from the encumbrances of the earth, never, even then, have we
   anything good that is to be ascribed to ourselves! If it be good, it
   all comes from God!

   Then, we read in Isaiah, and in some other passages which I need not
   quote, of the streams in the desert "In the wilderness shall waters
   break out, and streams in the desert...I will open rivers in high
   places." That is an odd place for rivers! "Rivers in high places, and
   fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a
   pool of water, and the dry land springs of water." Do you, Beloved,
   remember your dry-land springs? Can you not remember when you ate of
   treasures hidden in the sand--when it was dark, and yet was never so
   much light? When you were in the land of barrenness, and yet were never
   so filled with plenty? When you had abounding troubles and yet never
   had such super abounding comforts? Oh, let us bless the Lord that our
   desert springs were in Him! They were in Him, or we would not have had
   them! Had not the Lord been with us, we would have fallen and died in
   the wilderness like those who came out of Egypt, whose carcasses
   strewed the plain!

   If you turn to the 4th Chapter of Deuteronomy, verse 49, you will read
   about springs that some of God's saints drink of that are not often
   mentioned--the springs of Pisgah. Moses there speaks of the springs
   that came from the foot of Pis-gah. And believe me, they are cool
   streams, indeed, and supply drink that goes down sweetly and makes the
   lips of them that sleep to speak! He who knows what Heaven is and has,
   by faith, viewed it--who has seen its security, its purity, its
   nearness to God, its revelation of the face of Christ, its communion of
   saints, its joy of the Lord--such an one has found the Pisgah springs
   to be very precious and very soul-reviving! Oh, for a draught of them
   now! I think some of us had such a draught at our last Prayer Meeting
   when we talked together, and sang the hymn that ends--

   "A scrip on my back, and a staff in my hand, I march on in haste
   through an enemy's land. The road may be rough, but it cannot be long,
   And I'll smooth it with hope, and cheer it with song." The prospect of
   the coming Glory makes the Pisgah springs well up--and all of them are
   in our God, for there is no true hope of Heaven without Him! There
   would be banishment into eternal woe if it were not for His Infinite
   Grace!

   Thus I might continue to use the similes of Scripture, and show that
   whatever sort of springs there may be, they all come from the great
   deep of the Infinite Love of God and that all our springs are in Him.

   II. But now we come to our second point, namely, that ALL THE SPRINGS
   THAT ARE WITHIN US COME FROM THE SAME SOURCE.

   You know that our Savior says, concerning the man who drinks of the
   water that He gives, that it "shall be in him a well of water springing
   up into everlasting life." A Christian is not a cistern that is filled
   and emptied, but, by God's Grace, he becomes a living well! He is not a
   puppet moved with strings. He is not a machine that is wound up and
   goes by wheels mechanically worked--there is a living Power in him! He
   is a new creature in Christ Jesus, instinct with the highest form of
   life and that life possessed in the highest degree of freedom, for
   while a man is naturally a free agent, yet he is in a far superior
   sense a free agent when he becomes a converted soul! "If the Son shall
   make you free, you shall be free indeed."

   Our text, then, may mean this--that all the springs of our inner life
   lie in God. "For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in
   God." "And you has He quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins."
   Christ is your life. All the springs of life are in Him.

   And hence, next, all the springs of our secret thought and of our
   devotion are in Him. You cannot always think of God and worship God
   alike. At least if you can, and it is real devotion, I greatly envy
   you. I find that in my soul, there are times when I have the wings of
   an eagle and can mount up and, with unblinking eyes, look into the
   Infinite Glory and I can soar on and on in strange ecstasy and delight.
   At another time, I cannot rise from the ground. The chariot wheels are
   taken off, as in Pharaoh's case, so that we drag heavily. Then Dr.
   Watts' words seem appropriate--

   "Our souls can neither fly nor go, To reach eternal joys."

   The preacher, too, is sometimes fertile enough and, at another time
   barren. Truly, the Christian's experience is not unlike Pharaoh's
   dreams. He has lean and fat cattle, withered ears, and ears rank and
   good come up. This is doubtless to show him that when he has sacred
   thoughts and devotion, they come from God. In order that he may see
   that, he is sometimes left to prove his own emptiness. To show that the
   strength of Sampson does not lie in muscle and sinew and bone, alone,
   his hair is shorn and when he goes forth as before, he performs no feat
   of strength--he is as weak as any other man. Yes, Beloved, if we have
   any power of thought, or sweetness of devotion in drawing near to God,
   all the springs lie in Him.

   So is it, most certainly, with the springs of our emotions. Do you not
   find yourselves sometimes sweetly melted down by the power of God's
   Word? Could you not, at such times, sit and weep under the thought of
   the death of Jesus and His unspeakable love to you? Sometimes do you
   not feel stirred with sacred joy, so that you could burst out with an
   impromptu hallelujah, or begin to sing a new song to the praise of His
   great love wherewith He has loved you? At other times you think about
   the same theme, but your heart feels no power--the same song is sung,
   but though your lips join in it, your heart does not go with the
   melody. You know it is so.

   You cannot command your own spirit--the Lord must help you. The springs
   of your emotions lie in His hands. If He leaves you, you are like the
   Arctic sea, frost-bound. But when He comes and smiles upon you, all the
   icebergs melt in a moment and your heart feels the warm Gulf Stream of
   Eternal Love flowing right through it! Then there comes the time of the
   blossoming of Spring and the singing of the birds--the whole heart is
   alive unto the Most High! The springs of your emotions, as well as of
   your sacred thought and devotion all lie in Him!

   And I am sure it is so with regard to the springs of all true actions.
   Christians are not all thought and all emotion-- they are practical men
   and women--and seek to work for God. But did any of us ever do a good
   work in our own strength? We have done many works in our own strength,
   but were they good for anything? The Savior shall decide that question.
   "Without Me you can do nothing," He says. You can bring forth fruit
   without Him, but your fruits are as the vines of Sodom and of the
   fields of Gomorrah. Only that is right which comes from Him. When He
   blesses us, our actions done for Him are accepted through Him.

   Well, Beloved, it will always be so, that our springs of holy zeal, our
   springs of joy, our springs of fellowship, our springs of every kind
   that are worth the having, all lie in Him! And it will be good if the
   whole Church recognizes that fact. We cannot get up a revival--it is a
   great pity that we should ever try to do so--for such a revival, if we
   seem to get it, will be very mischievous. But the Lord can send us a
   true revival! All our springs are in Him. We must not depend upon
   ministers and pray, "If So-and-So shall preach, good results will
   follow." Our springs are not in these poor cisterns, they are in our
   God! When will the Church try to look away from the creature to the
   Creator? When will she purge herself of that hereditary fault of hewing
   out for herself, broken cisterns, and forgetting the Fountain of
   Livings Waters? I am persuaded, from my own experience, that the more I
   live upon God, alone, the more I truly live and the less I know of
   anything like power, or wisdom, or anything of the sort pertaining to
   myself, the better! The more I decrease and He

   increases, the more do I grow up in the Lord in all things. May we,
   then, each one of us, adopt this sweet motto and always say, "All my
   springs which are within me, as well as those of which I drink, are in
   my God." I shall only keep you long enough to say three more things--

   The first of which is, let us look to these springs. If you do not feel
   up to the mark, if you are dull and heavy and have no springs in
   yourself, remember that they never were there! "All my springs are in
   You." Do you feel empty? Well, you only feel just as you are! You feel
   as though there was death written upon you. Quite so, there is! Your
   life is in Christ! Your fullness is in Christ! Your strength is in
   Christ! Has it been reported to you that Christ has lost His power,
   that His life has declined? If it were so, you would have great cause,
   indeed, for weeping, but while He is the same, the well of water is the
   same! I know, tonight that you are like Hagar--the water is spent in
   the bottle. Well, it never was much of a bottle, and it leaks. Now you
   think, "What shall I do? All my little store is gone." "What ails you,
   Hagar?" There is a well near you. Open your eyes, for God sees you and
   God provides for you! Christ is always the same.

   "Oh, but I think I have forgotten Him," you say. Then remember Him.
   "But I fear I am not one of His people." Well, if you are not a saint,
   you are a sinner--and He came to save sinners. I always find the short
   cut to Christ to be the best one. "Oh," says Satan, "you are no child
   of God." "No," I say to him, "nor are you, either." "Ah," he says, "but
   you have no true experience." "No," I reply, "I have not, nor have you,
   either, but one thing I know--I am sinful and Christ has said that
   washing in His blood by faith, I shall be made clean. If I cannot go to
   Him as a saint, I will go even now as a sinner! Suppose I have been
   mistaken in the past, I will begin again." Child of God, that is the
   only way to end the controversy. Go and stand at the foot of the Cross,
   again. Begin again, for all your springs are still there! Though you
   cannot find any springs in yourself, they are still in God!

   The next thought is this. If all my springs are in God, then let all my
   streams flow to God. All the rivers run into the sea because they all
   came from the sea. It was from the sea that the sun drew up the clouds
   which fed the thousand rills which fall into the rivers--and so the
   rivers run back to the sea. Let us do the same. What we have had from
   God must go to God. Even in temporals we ought to do this. I remember a
   story of Martin Luther's. When certain monks complained that the income
   of the monastery had got very slack, he said, "Yes, and no wonder,
   because once they used to entertain two strangers at the monastery, the
   one named Date, the other named Dabitur. Give was the name of one. It
   shall be given was the name of the other. Now," said Martin Luther,
   "you turned out, Give, and very soon God took away It shall be given,
   for they are brothers and they live together. If you would have Dabitur
   back, you must also have Date. If you would have back, It shall be
   given, you must also have back, Give."

   When we are not serving God acceptably--consecrating everything to
   God--we lose supplies from God. In temporals, I have known men give to
   God by the shovelfuls--and God sent silent wagon loads by the back
   door--they could not send back their substance as fast as He sent it
   in! Jesus said, "Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure,
   pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give
   into your bosom"--and many have found it so. Your mean skinflints have
   gone on flint-skinning until they died and have left hardly enough to
   be buried with respectably. While others have scattered and yet
   increased. If our springs are in Him even in temporal things, let the
   streams run back to Him. Let us not rob God! And as to spiritual
   things, let us give back to God the more He gives us--the faith He
   gives us, the spiritual strength He gives us. Let us use for Him the
   experience He has given us, the instruction He has given us. Let us
   instruct and encourage others to His Glory with what we have received!
   Let us lay out every talent and keep none buried in the earth. May the
   Lord grant to each of us Divine Grace to always say to Him, "As all my
   springs are in You, so all my streams shall be to You."

   And, lastly, let us have a great deal of hope about other people,
   because if all the streams are in God, I have not to consider, when I
   go forth to do good to my fellow man, what is in them--I have to
   consider what is in God! When I address a sinner and say, "Believe on
   the Lord Jesus Christ," I do it because God tells me to do it--just as
   I would have said to the dry bones, "Live"--and if I do it in God's
   name, being perfectly sure they cannot believe of themselves, then I am
   doing right, for I am exercising my own faith! It is an act of faith on
   the preacher's part--and God will bless that act of faith--and many of
   the dry bones will live, sinners will repent and will, by His Grace,
   believe the Gospel!

   We must not think that our hope lies in what is in the sinner. I heard
   a man preach about the adaptation of the sinner to the Gospel and I
   thought he was very foolish, for what is there in the sinner but
   everything that is opposed to the Gospel, everything uncongenial,
   everything that would put the Gospel to death if it could?

   All the power of the Gospel lies in itself, not in the
   sinner--salvation comes from God, and God alone. Therefore there is no
   reason why I should not preach the Gospel with a hope of success in
   Wandsworth Prison, or in the lowest slums in London! You may distribute
   tracts and give warnings to the harlot and the thief with good hope of
   success. In fact, there are often ridges in the lowest soils, like the
   clearings of the backwoods in the West, which are not plowed and tilled
   till the goodness has gone out, as it were--to them the Gospel comes as
   a strange novelty. It was so in the Savior's day. The Pharisees, who
   knew so much, rejected His Word, but the publicans and harlots entered
   into the Kingdom of Heaven before them.

   Therefore, there is nothing about the sinner to make us hesitate to
   preach to him because if he is dead, God can lift him up. Yes, if he is
   like Lazarus, dead and buried, the Voice of God can call him forth from
   the tomb! Yes, if he were as nothing, God makes the things that are
   not, to be mightier than the things that are! He can bless where all
   was cursed. Out of the stones of the brook He can raise up children to
   Abraham. Let us have great comfort, next Sunday, in going to preach, or
   to teach in the Sunday school, or to engage in other forms of
   usefulness. All the springs lie in God and if we are going to work in a
   dry and thirsty land where there is no water, never mind! Our springs
   are in God--our faith is in Him and, according to our faith, so shall
   it be done to us. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM34

   Verse 1 I will bless the LORD at all times: His praise shall
   continually be in my mouth. What a sweet resolve! Oh, that all of us
   who know the Lord would make that resolve and keep it all our days--"I
   will bless the Lord at all times." In dark times and bright times, as
   long as I live. "His praise shall continually be in my mouth"--that is
   the most delightful mouthful that a man can possibly have!

   2. My soul shall make her boast in the LORD. We do not like boasters,
   but we would encourage every child of God to boast in the Lord as much
   as he pleases!

   2. The humble shall hear thereof and be glad.There is nothing that
   humble people dislike more than to hear others boasting--yet there is
   nothing that they like more than to hear anyone boast in the Lord!

   3. Omagnify the LORD with me. There is a sweet contagion about the
   praise of God. We want others to help us to spread it everywhere, so we
   say with David, "O magnify the Lord with me"--

   3-4. Andlet us exalt His name together. Isought the LORD, andHe
   heardme, and deliveredme from allmy fears. There is nothing that is so
   effective as personal testimony to the Lord's saving power. How often
   is the skill of a physician commended by the grateful testimony of the
   patients who have been healed by him! So, shall not the prayer-hearing
   God be commended by those of us who have had our prayers answered by
   Him? Let us not be slow to say, "I sought the Lord and He heard me, and
   delivered me from all my fears."

   5. They looked unto Him and were lightened: and their faces were not
   ashamec. [See Sermon #195, Volume 4--looking unto

   JESUS.] "They looked unto Him"-a whole army of them, an

   innumerable company--"They looked unto Him and were lightened: and
   their faces were not ashamed." There never was a face that was ashamed
   of being turned Christward and Godward!

   6. This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of
   all his troubles. [See Sermon #2193, Volume 27--A

   POOR MAN'S CRY--AND WHAT CAME OF IT.] Here David speaks of himself
   again, but he refers to himself in the third person--"This poor man
   cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles."

   7. The angel of the LORD encamps round about them that fear Him, and
   delivers them. The great Angel of the Covenant, the Lord Jesus Christ,
   surrounds with His army the dwellings of the saints and takes care to
   have them in safe keeping.

   8-10. O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
   trusts in Him. O fear the LORD, you His saints. For there is no need to
   them that fear Him. The young lions do lack and suffer hunger: but they
   that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.[See Sermon #65,
   Volume 2--LIONS LACKING BUT THE CHILDREN SATISFIED.] We are often in
   need because we are not seeking the Lord, but are seeking what we think
   we need, whereas, if we sought Him and left the supply of our needs to
   Him, He would supply all our need according to His riches in Glory by
   Christ Jesus. Christ's command is, "Seek you first the Kingdom of God
   and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."
   Men think that they will not get what they want except they seek it,
   but if they seek God, He will give them what they really need even if
   He does not give them all that they want!

   11. Come, you children, hearken unto me. This man of God has made his
   confession to the saints and now he tells it to the children. There is
   nothing like working on material that will last--and those who are now
   children will, most of them, be alive when those who are now old men
   are dead and gone. So David says, "Come you children, hearken unto
   me"--

   11-13. I will teach you the fear of the LORD. What man is he that
   desires life, and loves many days; that he may see good? Keep your
   tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking guile. There is life or
   death in the human tongue! There is life in the tongue that is under
   subjection to the will of God. There is death, there is mischief of all
   sorts in a wild un-governed tongue!

   14. Depart from evil, and do good. Get away from evil as far as you
   can--that is the negative side. Do good--that is the positive side of
   piety. He who obeys these two commands shall find happiness and
   blessing.

   14. Seekpeace, and pursue it Do not be of an angry, irritable,
   quarrelsome frame of mind. If you do not at once find peace, seek it.
   And if it runs away from you, pursue it until you overtake it. Remember
   that it is the meek who shall inherit the earth--and that it is the
   peaceful spirit that is the happiest spirit.

   15. The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and His ears are open
   unto their cry. He gives them His eyes and His ears--and this means
   that He gives them Himself and that He is always ready to perceive
   their needs and to hear their cries.

   16. The face of the LORD is against them that do evil. He sets His face
   against them--and this means that He is, Himself, eternally opposed to
   all their wicked ways.

   16, 17. To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. The
   righteous cry, and the LORD hears and delivers them out of all their
   troubles. Not only out of some of them, but out of allof them. It is
   often a very long, "all." The list of their troubles is often difficult
   to read through but in due time there comes a "finis," to it written by
   the hand of Divine Mercy--"The Lord delivers them out of all their
   troubles."

   18. The LORD is near unto them that are of a broken heart; and saves
   such as are of a contrite spirit Not your proud spirits, not your
   hectoring ones, but your lowly, penitent souls are the ones that are
   dear to the heart of God. He is near to them and saves them.

   19, 20. Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but the LORD
   delivers him out of them all. He keeps all his bones: not one of them
   is broken.He will have many a flesh wound, but there shall be no
   permanent injury to him. And even though his body were diseased, his
   soul would be saved.

   21, 22. Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
   shall be desolate. The LORD redeems the soul of His servants.Great as
   the price is, He pays it! They are so precious to Him that He minds not
   what price He pays so that He may redeem the souls of His servants.

   22. And none of them that trust in Him shall be desolate. Blessed be
   His holy name!

Two Wilderness Incidents

   (No. 3214)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY
   30, 1863.

   "And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell
   that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against
   Israel, and took some of them prisoners. And Israel voweda vow unto the
   LORD, and said, If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand,
   then I will utterly destroy their cities. And the LORD hearkened to the
   voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly
   destroyed them and their cities: and He called the name of the place
   Hormah. And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to
   compass the land of Edom; and the soul of the people was much
   discouraged because of the way. And the people spoke against God, and
   against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
   wilderness? For there is no bread, neither is there any water and our
   soul loathes this light bread. And the LORD sent fiery serpents among
   the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died."
   Numbers 21:1-6.

   OUR text is a long one, but we must have it all in order to get the
   sense of the passage, so as to contrast the two wilderness incidents
   which are here mentioned and to learn how we may use them to our own
   spiritual profit.

   I. So, in the first place, LET US CONTRAST THESE TWO WILDERNESS
   INCIDENTS.

   First of all, let us examine the details of the first incident. We
   learn, from this part of the narrative, that the children of Israel
   were in real danger. They were attacked by a ferocious foe who, being
   probably aware that he was doomed to destruction, determined to
   anticipate the contest by fighting against the Israelites while they
   were unprepared, and so injuring them as much as he could. Arad appears
   to have been a king of some considerable power and his skill in warfare
   is proved by the fact that he was at least partially successful against
   the Israelites, for he, "took some of them prisoners." So that the
   people were in real danger. And have you not noticed, dear Friends,
   that God's people often behave best when they are in their worst case?
   Usually, when they are in imminent peril, they cry to their God to
   deliver them, and so they soon obtain relief--but when they make
   trouble for themselves by a willful fretfulness of spirit--then it is
   that they lose their confidence in God and, instead of playing the man,
   they play the fool!

   You must have noticed how often accidents happen to people when they
   are engaged in play rather than when they are at work. I always warn
   our friends to be especially careful when they are leaving for a
   holiday, for I have observed how frequently they come back with signs
   of having suffered injuries of one kind or another, though they have
   been perfectly well while occupied with their usual avocations. It is
   very much the same in spiritual things. While we are hard at work for
   the Lord, watching against temptation, striving against sin, or bravely
   enduring trial, we behave ourselves well. But full often when we are
   engaged in what ought to be mere child's play, getting rid of
   self-inverted and unreasonable fears, we stumble and fall and bring
   disgrace upon ourselves and upon our Christian profession. I think that
   if a Christian is to grow to the full stature of a man in Christ, he
   must be subjected to the strong winds of trial and temptation. The
   dross must be separated from the gold by the fierce heat of the
   furnace. I have heard such a remark as this many a time, "I never knew
   what a Christian, So-and-So was until he lost his property, or his
   wife, or his children, or until he was stretched upon the bed of
   sickness and death." There is something in the keen wintry air that
   braces us and strengthens us for work--but the soft summer zephyrs make
   us feel faint and languid and unfit for vigorous exertion. So, in a
   spiritual sense, the summer zephyr of ease often weakens us, while the
   sharp, stern trials of our seasons of adversity make us strong to
   endure in the time of testing--

   "Often the clouds of deepest woe

   So sweet a message bear.

   Dark though they seem, 'twere hard to find

   A frown of anger there.

   It needs our hearts be weaned from earth,

   It needs that we be driven,

   By loss of every earthly stay,

   To seek our joys in Heaven."

   It was, therefore, for good rather than for evil that the Israelites
   were allowed by the Lord to be placed in circumstances of real danger.
   Notice what they did--they resorted to their God by simple faith They
   did not depend upon their own prowess in war. God had enabled them to
   rout the Amalekites and to defeat many other adversaries. But when this
   new foe appeared, they did not rely upon their own swords, or spears,
   or bows--they went at once to the Lord and spread their case before
   Him. In humble, earnest prayer, they sought His aid and then they
   registered their solemn vow that if God would give them the victory
   over these Canaanites, they would execute His judgments upon them and
   utterly destroy their cities. This is still the right way for the
   Believer to go to God in times of real peril and trial! And this is the
   way in which he does go when the Spirit of God guides him. He comes to
   God, no longer resting in any carnal confidence, or depending upon his
   own wit or strength, but realizing that, "blessed is the man that
   trusts in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is." Like Hezekiah, when he
   spread Sennacherib's letter before the Lord, the Believer pleads with
   God for His name's sake, for His Son's sake, for His promise's sake, to
   deliver him out of all his troubles. And it may be that he is moved to
   add a solemn vow unto the Lord, for although vows are never to be made
   wantonly or wickedly, there are times when a vow may be incumbent upon
   us. Many an important step which I have taken, and which God has
   blessed, has been taken because of a vow that I have made to Him when
   my soul was in trouble. And I sometimes think that trouble is, in my
   own case, always a preparation for entering upon some new path of duty,
   or beginning some new enterprise for my dear Lord and Master. Should it
   not be so with all of us who are, indeed, children of God by faith in
   Jesus Christ? Let us, each one, say, "Lord, if You will deliver me out
   of this trial, then, whatever service I may have rendered to You in the
   past, I will add something more to it in the future. I will seek to add
   a few more acres to the fields which I have, up to now, attempted to
   plow, sow and reap for You. Or, if I cannot increase my sphere of
   service, I will try to serve You better in it than I have ever done
   before." You are not to make such vows as these as though they were a
   sort of bribe to the Most High, for you know that your best resolutions
   are only empty words unless His Grace enables you to follow them with
   corresponding deeds. Still, if you do it in humble dependence upon Him
   and in sincere gratitude for anticipated favors which your faith causes
   to be present to you, you may make such vows and expect God's blessing
   upon them!

   So you see, dear Friends, that the Israelites were in real peril, but
   they took their case to the Lord and, therefore, He gave them speedy
   and complete deliverance! "The Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel
   and delivered up the Canaanites." They seem to have marched straight
   out to meet their foes and to have routed them at once. So, Beloved,
   put your case in the hands of God and your difficulties will soon be
   over. Or if the trial is not removed, you will receive Grace and
   strength to bear it. The word, "impossibility," seems to block your
   road, but there are no impossibilities with God! With Him all things
   are possible. A man left to himself would break his back under the
   crushing burden that rests upon him, but that would not have happened
   to him if he had cast his burden upon the Lord. Many have lost their
   reason because they tried to carry their cares, themselves, instead of
   casting all their care upon Him who could easily have carried them.
   Brother, Sister, is it night with you? Then wait God's time to make the
   sun to rise again upon you. Is it ebb-tide with you? Wait a little
   while and God will again bring the silver streams up from the sea till
   the mud and filth are covered by the rising waters. What is there that
   He cannot do? If there is anything that you can do, work as if
   everything depended upon you--and then trust in God remembering that
   everything really depends upon Him!

   The action of the Israelites, in appealing to the Lord, not only
   brought them prompt deliverance, but it also advanced them in the path
   of duty. They were brought out of Egypt on purpose to smite and
   exterminate these Canaanites--a race upon which God's long-suffering
   could no longer be exercised--and the Israelites, as the Lord's
   executioners, "utterly destroyed them and their cities." Ah, my dear
   Friends, our troubles will help us to advance in the path of duty if we
   will but take those troubles to God! There is much to be learned in the
   furnace of affliction. There are some of God's writings that can only
   be read by light from a furnace. God has been pleased to write some of
   His promises in sym-

   pathetic ink which can only become visible as it is held close to the
   fire! You can see the stars in the daytime if you go to the bottom of a
   deep well--and you can see many a starry promise shining brightly when
   you are at the bottom of the well of trouble! The Lord sends trials to
   bring us to Himself, as Joseph sent the rumbling wagons to bring Jacob
   and all that he had to him in Egypt. And if we only know how to use
   them aright, we shall find that--

   "Trials make the promise sweet,

   Trials give new life to prayer!

   Trials bring us to God's feet,

   Lay us low, and keep us there." This, then, is the first of the two
   wilderness incidents. Now, turning to the second, I want you to note
   that there was no real cause for distress whatever. "The soul of the
   people was much discouraged because of the way," but there was nothing
   that need have discouraged them if they had looked upon the way with
   the eye of faith. It is true that God had led them a long way
   roundabout, but then that was because of their unbelief. And it is also
   true that God had "led them forth by the right way, that they might go
   to a city of habitation." It is true that the sun was hot, but then the
   cloudy pillar always shielded them in the daytime. It is true that they
   had to wander in the wilderness, but then God gave them bread from
   Heaven to eat and water out of the Rock to quench their thirst. It is
   true that they had no means of buying new clothes and new shoes, but
   then Moses was able to say to the whole nation before he left them,
   "Your raiment waxed not old upon you, neither did your feet swell,
   these forty years." It is true that many trials befell them in the
   wilderness, mostly through their own sin, yet were they the most
   highly-favored people upon the face of the earth! As Balaam "saw Israel
   abiding in his tents, he took up his parable and said, How goodly are
   your tents, O Jacob, and your tabernacles, O Israel! As the valleys
   are, they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of
   lign aloes which the Lord has planted and as cedar trees beside the
   waters." Yet, with all these privileges, "the soul of the people was
   much discouraged because of the way." It is true, dear Friends, that
   there are many troubles in the world, but probably the worst are those
   that we make for ourselves--or that we only imagine when there really
   are none! Last week I saw my dear old grandfather who is about 87 years
   of age, and I said to him, "I suppose, Grandfather, you have had many
   troubles in your long life." And he replied "Well, I have had none too
   many, except those that I have made for myself." And I expect that is
   true of the most of us! We have a little (or big) trouble factory
   somewhere in our home, or we carry it about with us wherever we go, and
   the suits we make there last as long as a suit in Chancery--they seem
   as if they would never wear out! And those home-made suits fit us very
   badly and are most uncomfortable. But if we would only leave ourselves
   in God's hands, we would be much more free from anxiety and trouble--

   "Eternal God, we look to You,

   To You for help we fly.

   Your eyes, alone, our needs can see,

   Your hands, alone, supply."

   When the Israelites became discouraged because of the way, did they
   take their trouble to God as they had done with the former one? Oh, no!
   It would have been a far happier thing for them if they had done so,
   but they, "spoke against God, and against Moses," saying, "Why have you
   brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no
   bread, neither is there any water, and our soul loathes this light
   bread." Often, when professors of religion fancy they are in trouble,
   they begin to rail at God--and at what they imagine to be the second
   causes of their troubles, as the Israelites "spoke against God, and
   against Moses." They say, "If my father had been a more prudent man,"
   or, "if So-and-So had given me wiser advice," or, "if my husband were
   not such a spendthrift, I would not have been in such trouble." These
   Israelites sinned doubly in speaking against God and against Moses, for
   the Lord had delivered them with a high hand and with a stretched-out
   arm. And Moses, also, had done them real service. He had taken the iron
   yoke from their necks and led them out of the house of bondage. Yet
   they talked as if he had been their enemy, or had deceived them! They
   said, "We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely, the
   cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the
   garlic. But now our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all, but
   this manna before our eyes." Thus do men often murmur against their
   best friends and frequently the murmuring against man is only a covert
   way of murmuring against God! Some grumble at the minister when they
   really mean that they do not like the Gospel that he preaches! Talking
   against Moses, it was not surprising that the Israelites also "spoke
   against God."

   Further, these people were in such a sad state that they ignored the
   mercies they were then enjoying. They said, "There is no bread, neither
   is there any water; and our soul loathes this light bread." So there
   wasbread, after all! That bread of which the Psalmist afterwards wrote,
   "Man did eat angels' food"--the best possible food for them in the
   wilderness! And there was water continually gushing out from the Rock
   that followed them. We, too, meet with many who can talk glibly enough
   of their miseries, but who are silent concerning their mercies! I
   daresay some of you know old Mrs. Complaint. If you ever go to see her,
   the moment you sit down she beams to tell you how she has been
   tormented all the week with rheumatism and then she says troubles never
   come alone, for that son of hers gives her constant anxiety and her
   neighbors are continually slandering her--and so on, and so on! You
   give her some relief and others give her relief, but she is never
   satisfied. When I have visited such a person, I have usually thought it
   well to say to her, "Well, Sister, you have told me about your
   troubles, now let us hear about your mercies! Surely you have some
   mercies for which you desire to praise the Lord." If you will talk thus
   to those who complain to you, it may be that after a little while, the
   conversation will take a more profitable turn. There are other
   grumblers beside that miserable old woman. There are other friends, in
   business, who try to persuade us that they are always losing money, yet
   they appear to live in considerable comfort--and we would like to have
   for the Lord's work some of the money that they spend upon luxuries of
   various kinds. So, when they complain of the hard times, and the keen
   competition in business, and the losses they are continually making, we
   are not greatly impressed by the sad story with which we are now fairly
   familiar! Then there are our farming friends who are far too often
   found in the ranks of the grumblers. If they do not actually speak
   against God, they frequently complain of the weather which He sends! It
   is either too wet or too dry, too hot or too cold! When crops are
   plentiful, prices are low--there is generally something or other which
   gives them an excuse for complaining, and so they sin against the Most
   High as the Israelites did in the wilderness!

   What did those people get as the result of their murmuring? Did the way
   become any shorter because their soul was much discouraged? Did the
   sharp stones become any smoother? Did the thorns and thistles of the
   wilderness become changed into vines and olive trees? Did their
   adversaries all sheathe their swords and flee from them in terror? No,
   the way was just as long as ever, the stones just as sharp, the
   brambles just as plentiful, their enemies just as fierce and each day
   was just as wearying as all those that had gone before! And now, in
   addition to all their previous troubles, "the Lord sent fiery serpents
   among the people, and they bit the people, and many people of Israel
   died." They complained when they had no reason for complaining--but now
   they had good ground for complaint or something to make them truly
   sorrowful! Their discontent, like a fire which never has sufficient
   fuel, was as a burning fever within them, so now fiery serpents set
   their veins aflame with their deadly poison! They were, indeed, rightly
   punished. They would not be content with the mercies which the Lord
   showered so abundantly upon them, so they were made to smart for their
   ingratitude! And our experience will be similar to theirs if we act as
   they did. We shall not be delivered from our troubles as the result of
   our complaining, but the Lord will chastise us with His rod of
   correction until He brings us humbly to confess our sins and to seek,
   for the future, to walk in His ways.

   So you see, dear Friends, the contrast between these two wilderness
   incidents. In the first case, real trouble carried to God in prayer was
   turned into an advantage. And in the second case, foolish and wicked
   discontent, for which there was no reason, was allowed to spend itself
   in murmuring against the Most High--and so brought down upon the people
   fiery serpents which bit them until many of them died.

   II. Now, secondly, LET US LEARN HOW WE MAY USE THESE TWO INCIDENTS TO
   OUR OWN SPIRITUAL

   PROFIT.

   Fellow Believer in Christ, you may do one or other of these two
   things--you may either cast your burden upon the Lord, and He will
   sustain you--or you may be like the bullock that is unaccustomed to the
   yoke and that kicks against the sharp goad and so angers his master and
   injures himself! Remember that true faith is a holy thing, but
   murmuring is sin. Do not think that it is a light thing to murmur
   against God, or to complain of His Providential dealings with you. No,
   it is really setting up your fallible judgment or your self-will
   against the Infinite Wisdom of the Most High! It is high treason
   against the King of kings to seek to--

   "Snatch from His hands the balance and the rod, Rejudge His judgments,
   be the god of God."

   Are you, poor feeble mortal, able to drive the chariot of the sun? Can
   you control the whirlwind and put a bit into the mouth of the storm
   when it is raging in all its fury? You know that it is God, alone, who
   can say to the mighty ocean, "To here shall you come, but no further:
   and here shall your proud waves be stayed." How dare you, then, set up
   your feebleness against His Omnipotence, and your ignorance against His
   Omniscience, and your folly against His consummate Wisdom? Bow down in
   the dust before Him lest your murmuring should bring upon you His
   righteous wrath and He should send upon you, if not fiery serpents,
   some other punishment that shall make you wring your hands in agony for
   many a day to come!

   Further, to trust in the Lord is both helpful and pleasant. It is said
   that if a man would lie quite still in the water, he would float--that
   it is his kicking and struggling that causes him to drown. Whether it
   is literally s o, I cannot tell, but I know that it is most delightful
   and most blessed--

   "To lie passive in God's hands And know no will but His."

   It is the kicking and struggling against the will of God that bring us
   trouble and increased suffering! God would use the knife very gently
   upon us, but we dash ourselves against the sharp instrument and then
   there is a great gash which need never have been made if it had not
   been for our own folly! Who are the happiest men in the whole world?
   Are they not those who tell the Lord all their trouble, and cast all
   their cares upon Him, knowing that He cares for them? And who are the
   most miserable people in the world? Are they not those who are
   constantly complaining of their miseries and who never seem to realize
   how many mercies they have received? If you need to make yourself
   miserable, you will not have much difficulty in doing so! He who is
   looking for sorrow will probably not have to look far before he finds
   it, but it is a great pity that he is not rather looking for sings and
   tokens of God's Providential care and of His forgiving mercy! Happy is
   he who can sing with Faber--

   "Ibow to Your will, O God,

   And all Your ways adore.

   And every day I live I'll seek

   To please You more and more!

   I have no cares, O blessed Lord,

   For all my cares are Thine--

   I live in triumph, too, for You

   Have made Your triumphs mine." Again, dear Friends, I think you can
   easily make a wise choice if I remind you that to trust in the Lord
   honors Him. For a child of God to repose in Him in full confidence must
   be pleasing in His sight. But for any child of His to be fretting,
   worrying, complaining, questioning must be dishonoring to Him. How
   would you feel if it were the case of one of your own children? If you
   heard him complaining that he did not know whether he would have any
   breakfast tomorrow morning, or where he would get any new clothes when
   his were worn out, you would say, "Trust me, my Child, and I will
   provide for you." But when your child says, "I know that my father will
   provide for me--no care about that matter ever crosses my mind," he is
   honoring you by his confidence! And it is the Christian who trusts God
   most who honors Him most.

   Remember, also, that it is to your own honor to trust in the Lord. This
   was the Master's own words to His disciples, "Take no thought, saying,
   What shall we eat, or, What shall we drink, or, How shall we be
   clothed? (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek). For your
   heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things. But seek
   you first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these
   things shall be added unto you." Any worldling can fret and fume about
   food, drink and clothing--but will you, a child of God, thus misbehave
   yourself? Why should you be groveling in the dust with the children of
   this world, when you should be soaring upward like the eagle, far above
   the mists and clouds of earth? Rise, Believer, to the dignity of your
   new-born nature, and cast all your care upon your God, who cares for
   you!

   Besides that, believing in Jesus will be likely to make you more useful
   We are hardly likely to bring sinners to Christ if we carry about with
   us a long and care-worn countenance! That will not be the way to
   recommend the Gospel to others. There are some professors who seem to
   think that the more wretched they can be, the more communion will they
   have with Christ, but they are greatly mistaken if they do! They appear
   to aim at being altogether unbearable in society and to

   be utterly miserable in retirement. If they imagine that in leading
   such a life as that, they are reflecting credit upon their Master,
   nothing could be more erroneous! You would not like your servant--I
   will go further than that and say--you would not like your horse or dog
   to be so lean that you could count his bones! It would be no credit to
   you to have such a servant, or horse, or dog--people who saw them would
   think they must have a sorry kind of master! The God of Love no more
   wishes to have miserable servants and followers than we do! Many of His
   servants have good reasons for being sad, but no true servant of God
   who is in his right senses, thinks it is his duty to make himself sad!
   Paul was Inspired when he wrote to the Philippians, "Rejoice in the
   Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice." And I believe it is the
   cheerful Christian, and especially the Christian who can be happy in
   sickness, patient under adversity and joyous even in the hour of death
   who will win fresh adherents for the Lord Jesus Christ!

   For all these reasons, then, I would have you follow the example of the
   children of Israel in the first of the two wilderness incidents we have
   been considering--but not in the second.

   But, Beloved, suppose and alas, we need not put it as a supposition,
   for it is only too true--some of us have been murmuring and God has
   sent a fiery serpent to bite us? We were discontented because of some
   fancied trouble and now we have a real trouble--what then? You remember
   how the narrative continues. "Therefore the people came to Moses, and
   said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against
   you; pray unto the Lord, that He take away the serpents from us. And
   Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said unto Moses, Make you a
   fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole, and it shall come to pass, that
   everyone that is bitten, when he looks upon it, shall live." So, when
   they sincerely repented of their sin in murmuring against the Lord and
   prayed to him through Moses as their representative and mediator, He
   revealed the remedy by which they could be healed. You remember when
   you first looked to Him of whom that bronze serpent was a type, and how
   you were immediately healed? So you must again look unto Him and He
   will cure the suffering which you have brought upon yourself by your
   murmuring! God loves you too well to let you perish despite your
   ingratitude and unbelief! He abides faithful and before our eyes He
   holds up, once again, His well-beloved and only-begotten Son, and bids
   you look unto Him even as you did at the first! Happy is the Christian
   who is always "looking unto Jesus." Believer, if you have lost your
   evidences. If through your murmuring against God you have been so
   sorely chastened that you cry out in agony! And if you are now walking
   in darkness and can see no light, remember that Jesus Christ is the
   same yesterday, today and forever! So still look to Him! Say to Him,
   "Just as I am, as once I came to You, O Jesus, my Lord and Savior, I
   come to You again! Though stained once more with my own wanton
   wickedness in murmuring against You when Your many mercies ought to
   have comforted me and made me rejoice, I still come to You and I
   believe that You can pardon, and relieve, and succor, and save, and
   sanctify me, now, even as You did at the first."--

   "Just as you are, without one trace

   Of love, or joy, or inward Grace,

   Or meetness for the heavenly place,

   O guilty Sinner, come!

   'The Spirit and the Bride say, Come.'

   Rejoicing saints re-echo, Come!

   Who faints, who thirsts, who will, may come!

   Your Savior bids you come."

   If any of you have never come to Jesus, come now! If you have never
   looked to Him who hung upon the Cross, sin-bitten Sinner, look to Him,
   now, and you shall be saved at once! If you have looked to Him, before,
   look again, now, and never take your eyes off Him until they are closed
   in death! And even then, the eyes of your soul shall still continue
   looking unto Jesus--only they shall look upon Jesus sitting upon the
   Throne of God as now, by faith, you look upon Him hanging on the Cross!

   May the Lord add His blessing, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: NUMBERS21:1-9; JOHN 3:1-15.

   Numbers 21:1-4. And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the
   south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he
   fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners. And Israel
   vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If You will indeed deliver this
   people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. And the
   LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites;
   and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and He called the
   name of the place Hormah. And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way
   of the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people
   was much discouraged because of the way.They were not allowed to go
   through the land of Edom. They had, therefore, to turn around and go
   right away from the land where they one day hoped to dwell. And the
   road was a particularly trying one, over hot and burning sand, "and the
   soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way." Sometimes
   God's own people, when they find that they are not so far advanced in
   the Divine Life as they thought they were, when they find old sins
   reviving and when troubles multiply upon them, get "discouraged because
   of the way." If this is our experience, let us not fall into the sin
   into which these Israelites fell, but even in our discouragement let us
   turn to our God.

   5. And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you
   brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no
   bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loathes this light
   bread. One gets tired, in reading of the wanderings of Israel in the
   wilderness, of this parrot cry, "Why have you brought us up out of
   Egypt?" For nearly 40 years, this was their cry whenever they met with
   any sort of difficulty. How weary God must have been of their cry--and
   of them, too! And now it was raised because they had been fed with
   "angels' food" which they called "light bread." It was easy of
   digestion, healthful and the very best kind of food for them in the
   wilderness--but they wanted something more substantial, something that
   had a coarser flavor about it, more of earth and less of Heaven! There
   is no satisfying an unregenerate heart. If we had all the blessings of
   this life, we would still be vying for more.

   6. And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the
   people; and many people of Israel died. Therefore the people came to
   Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD,
   and against you; pray unto the LORD, that He take away the serpents
   from us. And Moses prayed for the people. Like a true mediator, he was
   always ready--even when they had most insulted him and grieved his meek
   and quiet spirit--still to bow the knee and intercede with the Lord on
   their behalf. The people implored him to ask that the serpents might be
   taken away from them, but apparently they still continued to trouble
   them. However, if God does not answer prayer in one way, He does in
   another. The fervent prayer of a righteous man may not prevail in the
   particular direction in which it is offered, but it "avails much" in
   some direction or other! Just as when the mists ascend, they may not
   fall upon the very spot from which they rose, but they fall somewhere.
   And true prayer is never lost--it comes back in blessing, if not
   according to our mind, yet according to Another mind that is kinder and
   wiser than our own!

   8, 9. And the LORD said unto Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set
   it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that everyone that is
   bitten, when he looks upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of
   brass and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent
   had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. [See
   Sermons #285, Volume 5--

   MAN'S RUIN AND GOD'S REMEDY and #1500, Volume 25--NUMBER 1500--OR,
   "LIFTING UP THE BRONZE SERPENT."]

   John 3:1-3. There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler
   of the Jews: the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto Him, Rabbi,
   we know that You are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these
   miracles that You do, except God is with him. Jesus answered and said
   unto him, Verily, verily I say unto you, Except a man is born-

   again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God. [See Sermon #130, Volume
   3--REGENERATION.] There must be a new birth because a new nature is
   absolutely necessary for the discernment of spiritual things. The
   natural man cannot comprehend spiritual things--they must be
   spiritually discerned. The new birth is therefore necessary that we may
   have a Spirit within us which can see or understand the Kingdom of God.
   But until a man is born-again, "he cannot see the Kingdom of God."

   4, 5. Nicodemus said unto Him, how can a man be born when he is old,
   can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus
   answered, Verily, verily, Isay unto you, Except a man is born of water
   and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God. We understand
   the passage to mean, "Water, that is, the Spirit," but it may refer to
   the purifying influence of the Word as symbolized by water. I do not
   think that Baptism is referred to here at all.

   6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh.Parents may be the most
   devout people who ever lived, but that which is born of them is only
   flesh.

   6. And that which is born of the Spirit is spirit It is only then, as
   we are born of the Spirit of God that there is any spiritual life in us
   whatever.

   7, 8. Marvel not that I said unto you, You must be born-again. The wind
   blows where it wills, and you hear the sound thereof, but cannot tell
   from where it comes and where it goes: so is everyone that is born of
   the Spirit [See Sermon

   #1356, Volume 23--THE HEAVENLY WIND.] He undergoes a mysterious

   change. He becomes a new man and he enters into a new life which others
   cannot comprehend. Though they hear the sound of it, they cannot tell
   from where this man's new life comes, or where it goes. He has become a
   spiritual person, not comprehended of natural men.

   9-10. Nicodemus answered and said unto Him, How can these things be?
   Jesus answered and said unto him, Are you a master of Israel, and know
   not these things?"So learned in the Law of God, are you ignorant of the
   Spirit of God? Have you read the Law so many times and yet not found
   out that natural births and outward washings are of no use in spiritual
   things?"

   11, 12. Verily verily I say unto you, We speak what We know, and
   testify what We have seen; and you receive not Our witness. IfIhave
   toldyou earthly things, and you believe not, howshallyou believe ifI
   tell you of heavenly things? "If, at the very entrance to the Kingdom
   of Heaven, you say, 'How can these things be?' what will you say if I
   take you into the central metropolis of the Truth of God and introduce
   you to the great King, Himself?"

   13-15. And no man has ascended up to Heaven, but He that came down from
   Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in Heaven. And as Moses lifted up
   the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted
   up: that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal
   life. [See Sermon #153, Volume 3--the mysteries of the bronze serpent.]

Black Clouds and Bright Blessings

   (No. 3215)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1910.

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "If the clouds aire full of rain, they empty themselves upon the
   earth." Ecclesiastes 11:3.

   IT was raining very heavily this afternoon at four o'clock when I was
   thinking over this text. The sharp crack of the thunder and the quick
   flash of the lightning seemed to be constant where I sat. When I came
   here, I found that you had not had a drop of rain--the weather was just
   as hot and feverish as ever. This seemed to me an example and an
   illustration of the Sovereignty of God's dispensations. It is still
   true in the spiritual as well as the natural economy, that one place is
   rained upon and another is not rained upon. In one part of the Church,
   God's Grace descends in a flood, while another part remains as dry and
   arid as the wilderness, itself. Even under the same ministrations, one
   Christian's soul may be refreshed till it becomes like a watered garden
   while another may remain parched as the desert. God has the key of the
   rain and it is for us to ask Him to give us of the dew and the rain of
   His Holy Spirit. Let us walk humbly before Him lest He should say of
   us, as He did of His Jewish vineyard of old, "I will also command the
   clouds that they rain no rain upon it." We may stand up and look to the
   Most High and learn our dependence upon Him for spiritual blessings,
   just as the farmer, knowing his dependence for his harvest upon God,
   watches the sky and the clouds--for without the rain what can he do?

   But now, to come to the text itself, I propose a meditation upon three
   of its practical uses. First, as suggesting a comfort for the timid.
   Secondly, as giving an argument with the doubting. And thirdly, as
   furnishing a lesson to the Christian.

   I. First, I think we may fairly use the text as A COMFORT FOR THE
   TIMID.

   The clouds are black, they lower, they shut out the sunlight, they
   obscure the landscape. The timid one looks up and says, "Alas, how
   black they are and how they gather, fold on fold! What a dark, gloomy
   day!" What makes them black? It is because they are full of rain and,
   therefore, light cannot pierce them. And if they are full, what then?
   Why, then it will rain and the hot earth will be refreshed! And every
   little plant and every tiny leaf and rootlet of that plant will suck up
   moisture and begin to laugh for joy. Out of the black sky comes the
   bright daisy and the garden is painted with many colors--and the only
   palette that is used is, after all, that black one--for the sky does it
   by its rain.

   Now, Christian, you too, are of a timid disposition and every now and
   then, your circumstances are not as you would like to arrange them.
   Losses come very closely, one upon another. Friend after friend
   forsakes you. Sickness treads upon the heel of sickness. All things
   seem to be against you, as against Jacob of old. The clouds are very
   black, but may they not be black for the very same reason as the clouds
   above you--because they are full? And is it not very possible that it
   will be with you as it has been with all God's saints, according to the
   hymn we sang just now--

   "You fearful saints, fresh courage take.

   The clouds you so much dread

   Are big [yes, black] with mercy, and shall break

   Li blessings on your head"?

   If the clouds were not black, you might not expect rain! If your
   afflictions were not grievous, they would not be profitable. If your
   adversities did not really pain and trouble you, they would not be
   blessed to you. We have heard some people say, "If this trouble had
   come in such-and-such a shape, we would not have minded it." But God
   meantyou to mind it, for it was in your minding it that it was blessed
   to you! "The blueness of a wound," says Solomon, "cleanses away evil."
   When the stroke causes black and blue wounds, when the spirit is really
   thoroughly wounded, then the blessing comes! It is not merely said in
   the Scriptures that there is a necessity for affliction. That is a
   great Truth of God, but it is added

   that there is a necessity that the affliction should lower our spirits.
   Listen to the words--"Now for a season, if necessary, you are in
   heaviness through manifold temptations." The necessity is not merely
   for the temptation, but that you be in heaviness through the
   temptation--not for the iron, only, but for the iron entering into your
   soul. If the child liked the rod, it would be no chastisement--and if
   the Christian loved his affliction while he was in it--and it seemed
   joyous to him, then it would be no affliction! But it is the very
   sharpness of it, the vinegar and gall, that is the medicine that
   produces the good effect. The blackness of the cloud proves its
   fullness--and its fullness brings the shower.

   I suppose we know this experimentally. As a Church, we can look back
   upon mercies which God has given us in a very extraordinary manner God
   intended that this house should be full of hearers every Sabbath for
   years. It is a very remarkable circumstance and one that always
   astonishes me more, perhaps, than it does any of you, when I see the
   aisles and every place crowded Sabbath after Sabbath. But how much of
   the success, with which God has crowned our ministry, has been due to
   the most afflicting Providence that ever befell a Christian minister or
   a Christian Church? Was it not, dear Friends--to allude to that sad
   event which is still upon the minds of some of us, and will be till we
   die--when the cry was raised and death came into the midst of our
   solemn assembly? Was it not due to that, to a very great extent, that
   the preacher became known and that so he has had an opportunity of
   speaking to many more souls than otherwise would have listened to him
   concerning the unsearchable riches of Christ?

   You will have found it so, I think, in your own private estate. A big
   wave has washed you on to a safe rock. A black lifeboat has taken you
   out of a gay and bright, but leaky vessel, and brought you to your
   desired haven. You have been unburdened. If you have lost your riches,
   you have been better without them then with them. Your losses have, in
   the end, come to be practical gains. The good ship has gone across the
   waters more swiftly when some of that which was but needless ballast
   has been heaved overboard! I am sure I can allude to your
   spiritualsorrows--certainly I can to my own--as being most
   soul-enriching. It is when one labors under a deep sense of sin--when,
   perhaps, one's hope is jostled to and fro like a reed shaken by the
   wind--when the spirit sinks and the soul is brought very low--it is
   thenthat we learn to study the promises, find out their value, prove
   their faithfulness and to know and understand more than ever of the
   Grace and goodness of a Covenant-keeping God! "Before I was afflicted I
   went astray, but now have I kept your word." This is only another way
   of putting the same Truth of God. The clouds were full of rain, but
   they emptied themselves upon the man who needed Grace from on high!

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, what has been true in the past, depend upon
   it, is true in the present. I do not know-- how can I tell?--what is
   your particular trouble, but I do believe that He who appointed it, He
   who measured it, He who has set its bounds and will bring you to the
   end of it, has a gracious design in it all! Do not think that God deals
   roughly with His children and gives them needless pain. It grieves Him
   to grieve you! "He does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children
   of men." It is easy to have a faith that acts backwards, but a faith
   that will act forwards--a faith for the present and for the future is
   the true faith--and the faith that you need now. Has God helped you out
   of one trouble after another and is it to be supposed that He will
   leave you in this? In six troubles He will deliver you--yes, in seven
   there shall no evil touch you. The particular water in which you now
   are struggling is intended and included in the promise, "When you pass
   through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they
   shall not overflow you." It is, I must confess, sometimes difficult to
   bring the promise down to the particular case, for unbelief fights hard
   against it, but remember, unless the promise is applied to the
   particular case, it is like the liniment which is not applied to the
   wound, or like the medicine that is not received by the patient. The
   medicine not received may be very potent, but the man cannot know its
   value--and the promise of God may be very sweet and precious, but it
   cannot comfort you unless it is applied! Do ask, then, for Grace that
   you may believe while you are still under the cloud, black as it looks,
   that it will empty itself in blessed rain upon you.

   So will it be, on the largest possible scale, in the whole Church of
   Christ. There are many clouds surrounding the Church of God just now.
   And I must confess that with all the religious activity there is
   abroad, there is very much to cause us great sorrow. The friends of
   evangelical opinions are few compared with the advocates of Broad
   Churchism and Romanism. The strength seems to be, meanwhile, on the
   wrong side--and the devil has stirred up a fierce tempest by reason of
   which some are alarmed. But we must not yield to fear. The Master knows
   that it is right for His soldiers to be sometimes rebuffed at Ai,
   though they have won Jericho, that afterwards they may search and find
   out the accursed thing and stone the Achan who has brought upon them
   defeat. He will yet be with us and the time shall come when we shall
   see that every cloud that was full of rain has emptied itself upon the
   earth!

   II. Our second point is AN ARGUMENT WITH THE DOUBTING AND THE
   DESPONDING.

   It is a law of Nature that a full thing begins to empty itself. When
   the cloud gets full, it no longer has the power of retaining its fluid
   contents, so it pours them down upon the earth. When the river gets
   swollen, does it not rush with greater impetuosity towards the deep?
   And the ocean, itself, is continually emptying itself into the ocean
   that is above the firmament--that same ocean above the firmament
   emptying itself again--according to the text, upon the earth. As there
   is a circulation in the body and every pumping of blood into the heart
   is accompanied by another pumping of it out again, so is there a
   circulation in this great world--everything revolving and the whole
   machine kept in order, not by hoarding, but by spending--not by
   retaining, but by consecutively getting and giving.

   Well now, dear Friends, you may gather that when the cloud is full, it
   is going to rain--and I want you to draw an argument from this. Our
   gracious God never makes a store of any good thing but He intends to
   give it to us. Just think for a moment of God, our gracious Father. He
   is Love. His name is Love. His Nature is Love. "God is Love." He is all
   goodness. He is a bottomless, shoreless sea, brimful of goodness! He is
   full of pardoning goodness to forgive sin. He is full of accepting
   favor to receive poor prodigals to His bosom. He is full of faithful
   goodness to watch over His dear children--full of bounteous goodness to
   bestow upon them all that they need. Now, if there is such a plenitude
   of goodness in the Father, it must be for some objective--not for
   Himself. Why should it be in Himself? It must be there for His
   creatures. Is it not written that He delights in mercy? We know that He
   makes the sun to shine upon the evil as well as upon the good. Then I,
   even though I am evil, will hope that this store of goodness in the
   heart of the Everlasting Father is intended, some of it, at any rate,
   to be poured out upon me, poor unworthy me! "If the clouds are full of
   rain, they empty themselves upon the earth," and if God is full of
   goodness, it is that He may spend that goodness upon the sons of men!
   But from where do those bright and sparkling drops come, flashing like
   diamonds in the sunlight, turning to many colors and forming the
   wondrous iris? From where do you come, from where do you come, O you
   bright and Heaven-born drops of matchless rain, all pure and free from
   every stain--from where do you come? "We are come down to the black,
   hard, dusty earth. We are going to fall upon the desert or upon the
   sea. We descend on herds that ask not for us. We descend upon the soil
   that is chapped and needs us, but has not a tongue to ask for us, nor a
   heart to feel its need. We come down from our element in Heaven to
   tabernacle among men and to do them good." And so is it with the
   goodness of our blessed Father! If it is in Him, it is there for those
   on the earth who need it--for those who do not even feel their need and
   whose need is, therefore, all the deeper! Those who cannot feel their
   need and who, therefore, have a need that is the deepest of all needs.
   O blessed goodness that delights to spend itself upon the unworthiest
   of men!

   Ah, troubled, doubting soul, think again and let me ask you, this time,
   to think a little upon Jesus Christ the Son of the Father Beloved, it
   is a part of our belief that "it pleased the Father whom in Him should
   all fullness dwell." We believe that in His atoning Sacrifice there is
   a fullness of satisfaction made to Divine Justice, that there is a
   fullness of cleansing power in His precious blood, that there is a
   fullness of righteousness in His holy life, a fullness of vivifying
   power in His Resurrection, a fullness of prevalence in His plea, and a
   fullness of representation in His standing before the Eternal Throne to
   take possession of Heaven for us! No one here, I think, looks upon
   Christ as a well without water, or as a cloud without rain. Now, dear
   Heart, if you believe Christ to be a cloud that is full of rain, for
   what reason is He full? Why, that He may empty Himself upon the earth!
   There was no need that He should be a Man full of sympathy except to
   sympathize with mourning men and women! There was no need that He
   should bleed except that He might bleed for you! There was no necessity
   that He should die except that the power of His death might deliver you
   from death! There was no need whatever that He should be a Servant
   except that His obedience might justify many! The fullness of His
   essential Godhead may be supposed to be there for Himself, but the
   fullness of His mediatorial Character is a mere waste unless it is
   there for you!

   A man, looking at the coal mines of England, naturally considers that
   God made that coal with the intention of supplying the world's
   inhabitants with fuel and that He stored it, as it were, in those dark
   cellars underground for this favored nation, that the wheels of its
   commerce might be set in motion. Well, now, if I go to those
   everlasting mines of Divine Faithfulness and of atoning efficacy which
   are laid up in Jesus Christ, I must conceive that there is a supply
   laid up for those who will require it--and so there is! Doubt it
   not--there is cleansing for the guilty, there is healing for the sick,
   there is life for the dead! If Jesus is full of power to save, He will
   save you. If you cry to Him, He will empty Himself upon you!

   To proceed yet further, I would ask the doubter to look at the infinite
   fullness of power which is treasured up in the Holy Spirit. It is a
   part of our conviction that there is no heart so hard that the Holy
   Spirit cannot soften it, no soul so dead that He cannot quicken it and
   no man so desperately set on mischief that his will cannot be subdued
   by the effectual power of the Holy Spirit working in him. We believe
   the Holy Spirit to be no mere influence, no inferior or secondary power
   of moral suasion, but to be absolutely Divine --a Divine Being exerting
   irresistible force upon the mental powers of man! Well, now, if there
   is this might, surely, when He appears in the Character of a Comforter
   and a Quickener, His might is there to be exerted. Is your heart hard?
   He will empty His softening influence upon it. Is it dead? His
   quickening power shall there find a congenial sphere in which to work.
   Are you dark? Then there is room for His light. Are you sick? Then
   there is a platform for His healing energy. "If the clouds are full of
   rain, they empty themselves upon the earth," and if the Spirit of the
   living God is full of might and energy, it is that He may manifest it
   in all those poor, needy souls who desire to feel its power!

   What a wondrous book this Bible of ours is! When you have read the
   Bible through a score of times, you may have only walked over the
   surface, then, or plowed, at most, the upper soil. If you take one
   passage and dig deep for the treasure that couches beneath, you will
   find it inexhaustible! This Book has in it a matchless fullness. It
   were as possible to measure space, or to grasp the infinite in the
   hollow of your hands, as to take the entire compass of Holy Scripture.
   "It is high, I cannot attain unto it." It is broad, I cannot reach its
   boundary. And especially is there a fullness of comfort in the promises
   of God's Word. Our hymn writer put it, I think, very properly--

   "What more can He say than to you He has said, You who unto Jesus for
   refuge have fled?" Now, why is there this fullness in the Bible? "If
   the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth." If
   the Scriptures are full of comfort, they are intended to be enjoyed, to
   be believed, to be fed upon by you! There is nothing to spare in this
   Book. There is not too little, but rest assured that there is nothing
   too much. He that goes out in the morning after this manna, though he
   gathers his omer full, he shall have nothing over. And if he gathers
   little, yet still he shall have no need. There is enough for all and
   all its fullness is meant to be used!

   I cannot apply that thought. I have not time to beat it out more, but I
   hope God means it for some of you. You do not trust God, some of you,
   as you ought to do. You measure His corn with your own bushel. You know
   that you would fail your fellow men and think that He will fail you.
   You know your own weakness and infirmity--and you imagine that He will
   faint or be weary. Moreover, you know that you could not do a very
   generous thing for some who have been ungrateful and unkind to you--and
   you think He cannot either. Remember that passage, "My thoughts are not
   your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, says the Lord. For as the
   heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your
   ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts." You think about saving--God
   only thinks about giving. You take a delight in getting--He takes a
   delight in bestowing. Go to Him! Go to Him! You would not need anybody
   to be long praying you to accept a gift, so do not think that God needs
   much beseeching in order to give, for it is as easy for Him to give as
   it is for you to accept! And as accepting seems congenial to our
   nature, so does bestowing seem congenial to His! Go to Him and He will
   empty out His Grace upon you!

   III. Now, thirdly, the text furnishes A LESSON TO CHRISTIANS.

   "If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth."
   The drift of the passage is, of course, to be gathered from the
   context--and it was intended by Solomon to teach us liberality. He
   says, "Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you know not
   what evil shall be upon the earth. If the clouds are full of rain, they
   empty themselves upon the earth." By which he means to say, "If your
   pocket is full, empty it out upon the poor and needy. If God has
   endowed you with much of this world's substance, look out for cases of
   necessity and consider it is as much the object of your existence to
   bestow help upon the needy as it is the design in the creation of a
   cloud that it should empty itself upon the earth."

   Do the clouds ever lose by emptying themselves? No doubt when the cloud
   has emptied itself, it is renewed and still goes on its course. At any
   rate, however it may be with the cloud, if it is dissipated when the
   rain descends, it is not so with the Christian. God has a way of giving
   by cartloads to those who give away by shovelfuls. If we give at the
   back door, and I do not think we ought to give at any other door--He
   will be pretty sure to give to us in greater abundance at the window
   and at the front door likewise. Says Bunyan--

   "There was a man and some did count him mad, The more he gave away, the
   more he had!"

   Thank God for men of that sort! "There is that withholds more than is
   meet, but it tends to poverty" and, on the other hand, that sentence
   which has in it the nature of a proverb and a prophecy is often
   verified--"the liberal soul shall be made fat." I need not say much
   upon this to my own congregation, with whom I am acquainted. Most of
   you, I believe, do empty yourselves upon the earth in proportion as God
   assists you and enables you to give. But there are many persons in this
   land--at least there used to be--worth thousands upon thousands a year,
   whose contributions to the cause of God are so utterly insignificant
   that it is difficult to suppose that the love of Christ has ever gone
   far enough into them to thaw their hearts, for it has not even
   penetrated their pockets, making the gold to melt and their riches to
   flow in liberality.

   I was spoken to by a brother minister, not long ago, when I was
   preaching for him, and he said, "Do not spare them, Sir, do not spare
   them. There is one pew there, in front of the pulpit, where three men
   sit who are worth a million between them. Our chapel is a thousand
   pounds in debt and yet three of our members have a million between
   them." I said to him, "I think you ought not to 'spare them,' yourself,
   I do not know why I should say it, only coming here to preach
   occasionally." "Well," he said, "but you may say, perhaps, what nobody
   else may." Really it is a most horrible thing that there should be such
   positive covetousness allied with a profession of
   Christianity--Christian men--shall I call them so?--who, after all the
   plain precepts of Scripture, practice idolatry! They talk of being
   "stewards," but they act practically as if they were the owners. When a
   man once gets into the habit of giving to the cause of God, it becomes
   as much a delight to contribute of his substance as to pray for God's
   bounty or to drink in the promises! How could I dare to exist if I
   still do not do something for Christ? Not do something for Jesus? Were
   it not to rob me of the highest privilege which can be accorded a man
   this side the grave? When I pray, I ask for something for myself or
   other people. When I praise, it is but little I can render. But oh, to
   think that I, a poor creature of God's own making, should be able to
   give to Him! It puts the creature in the highest conceivable light! It
   lifts him well above angels. There are works which laborious,
   disinterested, self-sacrificing Christians can do for Christ--

   "Which perfect saints above And holy angels cannot do." Let the wealthy
   empty themselves upon the earth, and this shall be the way to fill
   themselves!

   But, dear Friends, not many of us are entrusted with much wealth. Some
   Christians have a considerable amount of ability to serve the Lord.
   They are, perhaps, able to speak for the Master. Now, I think that
   wherever there is some knowledge of God's Word, a personal acquaintance
   with its power and some ability to speak, we should exercise our
   talent, if it is but one. And if we have ten, we should not keep one of
   the ten to ourselves. "If the clouds are full of rain, they empty
   themselves upon the earth." And if a man is full of ability, he is the
   more bound to empty himself. If there is any minister who ought to work
   hard, it is the man who is successful. If there is a person living who
   ought to be always successful, it is the man whom God helps to preach
   with power. If God makes me to be a full cloud, I must go on emptying
   myself. If He gives me good store, I must take care that I scatter it.
   We must do, each man according to his ability, for God requires not
   what a man has not, but what he has. Now, dear Christian Friends, are
   you all, out of love for Jesus, doing what you can for Him? Are you,
   whether you are big clouds or little clouds, trying to empty yourselves
   upon the earth? The nearest people of your acquaintance--your children,
   your kinsfolk, your neighbors--are you trying to show these the way of
   life--

   "Gladly telling to sinners round What a dear Savior you have found"?

   Though comparatively few of us have great ability, we all have some
   little capacity. Some Christians have a large amount of experimental
   knowledge. They are not eloquent, they are not educated, but they are
   wise. It has been our privilege to have some, in the very humblest
   walks of life, whose experimental knowledge of Divine things was very
   much more profound than would usually be found in a doctor of
   divinity--men and women who have learned their theology, not in halls
   and colleges, but in courts and cellars. They have learned how to pray
   on bare knees. They have learned how to cry to the God of Providence
   when the cupboard was empty. They have tried the reality of religion in
   the hospital and perhaps in the workhouse. Some have done business in
   the great waters and have seen the works of the Lord and His wonders in
   the deep. It is a great treat to talk to some of those old saints!
   Their lips are like the lips of the girl in the fable, which dropped
   jewels. There is a savor, an unction, about what they say. It is not
   theory, but experience with them--not the letter, but the very soul,
   marrow and fatness of the Truth of God! You do not find them looking to
   an

   arm of flesh, or talking about the dignity of manhood, or the glory of
   mental power and so on. They know of nothing human except weakness and
   nothingness! They trust in nothing but the Divine arm and the
   invincible strength of the Holy Spirit! Are there not some such here
   this evening? If you have any experience, let me say to you--as you
   have opportunity tell it out. Empty it upon the earth! If you have
   gained some knowledge of God, communicate it. If you have proved Him,
   confess to the generation about you that He is a faithful God!

   I recollect, in a time of very great despondency, deriving wonderful
   comfort from the testimony of a very aged minister who was blind and
   had been so for 20 years. When he addressed us with the weak voice of a
   tottering old man, but with the firmness of one who knew the truth of
   what he said--and spoke of the faithfulness of God because he had
   tasted and handled it, I thanked God for what he said! It was not much
   in itself. If I had read it in a book, it would not have struck me. But
   as it came from him--from the very man who knew it and understood it,
   it came with force and power! So, you experienced Christians, if any
   others are silent, you must not be! You must tell the young ones of
   what the Lord has done for you! Why, some of you good old Christian
   people--I do not mean all of you--but a few of you are very apt to get
   to talking about difficulties, troubles and afflictions more than about
   your joys, not unlike those persons in The Pilgrim's Progress who told
   poor Christian about the lions, and giants, and dragons, and the
   sloughs and hills, and all that sort of thing! They might have told
   this, but they should also have told of the eternal arm that sustains
   the Christian in his pilgrimage! Tell about the troubles--that is
   wise--but also tell about the strength of God that makes you
   sufficient! That is wiser! If you have experience, empty yourselves
   upon the earth!

   I cannot particularize an instance of what may happen to be the form of
   treasure which God has committed to any or all of you, but I think
   there is not one saint out of Heaven but has his niche to fill, some
   particular work to do and, therefore, some special talent entrusted to
   him. Do not hide it in the earth. Dig up that talent and put it out to
   heavenly interest for the benefit of others and for the glory of your
   God! Herein is the folly of so many Christians, that being wrapped up
   in the interest of their own salvation and taken up with their own
   doubts and fears, they feel little care and they take little trouble
   for others. They never seem to empty themselves out into the world that
   is around them, and never seem to get into a world bigger than the
   homestead in which they live. But when a man begins to think about
   others, to care for others, to value the souls of others, then his
   thoughts of God get larger! Then his consolations grow greater and his
   spirit becomes more Godlike. A selfish Christianity--what shall I call
   it but an unchristian Christianity, an impropriety in terms, a
   contradiction in its very essence? You do not find the men who are
   anxious after others so often troubled as those who give no thought
   except to themselves!

   Mr. Whitefield, in his diary, tells of his times of depression, but
   they are comparatively few. And when he is going from one
   "pulpit-throne," as he calls it, to another, and is preaching all day
   long and is hearing the sobs and cries of sin-ners--and perhaps bearing
   the hoots and pelting of a mob--sitting down as soon as he has done
   preaching in public, to finish up his letters, or to devote an hour to
   prayer, why, he has not time enough to get to desponding! He cannot
   afford space enough to be doubting his own interest in Christ. He is so
   engaged in his Master's service and has so much of the blessing of God
   upon it, that he goes right on without needing to stop! Christian, may
   you get into the same delightful state--warm with love to Christ,
   fervent with zeal for the spread of His Kingdom! You shall not need,
   then, to ask any longer--

   "'Tis a point I long to know Oft it causes anxious thought-- Do Ilove
   the Lord or no, Am I His, or am I not?"

   But you may give a very practical answer by saying--

   "There's not a lamb in all Your flock

   I would refuse to feed.

   There's not a foe before whose face

   I'd fear Your cause to plead." "If the clouds are full of rain, they
   empty themselves upon the earth."

   Observe, lastly, when it is that the clouds empty themselves. The text
   says when they are full. This is a broad hint, I think, to the
   Christian--it tells him, then, to work. David was to attack the
   Philistines at a certain signal--"When you hear the sound of a going in
   the tops of the mulberry trees, then shall you bestir yourself." Take
   this as a Divine signal, then--when you are full, it is time for you to
   set about doing good, emptying yourselves upon the earth! Mr. Jay tells

   young students--and there are some here--that they cannot always
   sermonize, but that there will come times when they can. "Now," he
   says, "when I find that the wind blows, I put up the sails. I make hay
   while the sun shines. And I get the outlines of my sermons when God
   assists me to do so, that I may have them in readiness, when, perhaps,
   the breeze may not seem to be so favorable and my mind not so much upon
   the wing."

   Do good to yourselves by storing up when you have opportunity. But yet,
   Christians have particular times when they feel fuller than at others.
   A sermon has warmed you, or you feel very joyous and zealous just now.
   Well, you will, perhaps, feel sick tomorrow. You had better go and do
   some good tonight! "Nothing like the time present," is the old world's
   motto. "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush," says the proverb.
   So rest assured that a duty done today will be worth two duties saved
   up for tomorrow! A word spoken for Christ to somebody before you go out
   of the Tabernacle may be the word you ought to speak. But if you wait
   till you have another opportunity, you may wait and wait, but the
   opportunity may never come. A Primitive Methodist Brother said at one
   of the meetings, lately, that the reason why the Primitive Methodists
   got on so was that other Christians were waiting for something to turn
   up, but that the Primitive Methodists turned it up, themselves! It was
   an odd thing to say, but there is a great truth in it. Some Christian
   people are always waiting for something to turn up. They want an
   opportunity of doing good and they mean to do it-- oh, so well--when
   they get the opportunity.

   My Brothers and Sisters, you always have an opportunity if you will.
   How does Solomon put it? "Whatever your hand finds to do"--the first
   thing which comes--"do it with all your might." You want work in a city
   like London? A Christian woman wants work for God in a city of three
   million inhabitants? A Christian man does not know what to do to serve
   his Master with all these courts, alleys and crowded houses--and all
   this filth and these thousands of gin-palaces--and this drunkenness
   running down the streets? Nothing for a Christian to do? You are lazy,
   Sir, or else you would never raise such a question! Say not, "What
   should I do?" but, "Where shall I begin doing it?" And I would say,
   begin at the point that is nearest to you. So they did when they built
   the walls of Jerusalem--every man built opposite to his own house.
   There, you see, the advantage was that he had not to walk two miles to
   his work, and then come back at night. They built opposite to his own
   house, and so he was spared all that trouble. And then, again, when he
   had a little leisure time when he went to his dinner, he could sit and
   look at his work and think how to do it better next time, so that there
   was an advantage in that. And there is a great advantage in Christians
   working near where they live and in taking up that part of Christian
   service most congenial to their circumstances and to their tastes.
   "Whatever your hand finds to do"--next to it, close to it--"do it with
   all your might." Begin to do it and continue to do it, being always
   steadfast and immovable in the work of the Lord!

   But if there is a time when you shall specially and particularly work
   for Christ, do it when you are full of His love. You have had a mercy
   lately--a great mercy--now is the time for special liberality! You were
   spared from bankruptcy during the great crisis, consecrate to God what
   might have been lost! You feel full of love to Jesus--go and talk about
   Jesus to those who do not know Him. You are full of zeal--let it
   manifest itself. You are full of faith--exercise it. You are full of
   hope--now go and lead others into the same hopeful state. Pray for a
   blessing upon others when you have had the best season of prayer, the
   sweetest period of communion at the Lord's Table, or when you have been
   well fed on the Word. "If the clouds are full of rain, they empty
   themselves upon the earth."

   May God grant to some here who have no rest, who are without God and
   without Christ, that they may know their emptiness--and then may the
   Lord fill them with His own rich Grace, as He will do to all those who
   put their trust in Him. The Lord bless you, every one! Amen.

The Two Gatherings

   (No. 3216)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 16, 1863.

   "Gather My saints together unto Me, those that have made a covenant
   with Me by sacrifice." Psalm 50:5.

   JUST a few sentences must suffice concerning the first meaning of the
   text. I think there can be little doubt that we have here a prophecy of
   our Lord's Second Advent and of the gathering together in one assembly
   of all the chosen people of God--both those who shall then be in Heaven
   and those who shall then be alive and remaining upon the earth. Having
   made a Covenant with Christ by sacrifice, these shall all be gathered
   together unto Him, to be partakers of His Glory when He reigns at the
   latter day in all the splendor of His millennial Kingdom here below.

   The text, however, seems to me to have two other meanings. I believe
   that it relates, first, to the gathering together of all God's chosen
   people by the preaching of the Word and by other means. And that,
   secondly, it also has a bearing upon the great gathering of all the
   chosen around the Throne of Christ in everlasting Glory.

   I. So, first, I have to speak concerning THE GATHERING TOGETHER OF ALL
   GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE BY THE PREACHING OF THE WORD AND BY OTHER MEANS.
   The text appears to me to be a message to God's people from the living
   lips of Him who redeemed us by His blood. He speaks to the heavensas
   though He would make all the Providences of God to be His servants for
   this great work, and to the earth as though the willing hearts of His
   people, there, would gladly obey the summons, "Gather My saints
   together unto Me; those that have made a covenant with Me by
   sacrifice."

   My first question will be, who are to be gathered? I think we must
   understand the text as relating to all the chosen people of God,
   including those who, as yet, have not been called and quickened and
   have not, in the strict sense of the term, made a personal covenant
   with God by faith. Our Lord Jesus Christ is the Divinely-appointed
   Representative of all the elect--whatever He did, He did as their
   Covenant Head, their Sponsor, Surety and Substitute. When He made a
   Covenant with God on behalf of His people, they virtually made that
   Covenant, too. As Adam's covenant concerned us all, and was practically
   our covenant with God, so Christ's Covenant concerns all who are in Him
   and is reckoned as the Covenant that they, also, have made with His
   Father. And I believe that the mission of the Gospel is to gather out
   from among the rest of mankind all those whose names are written on the
   roll of the Everlasting Covenant--those who were given to Christ by His
   Father before the foundation of the world!

   I know, of course, that the Gospel is to be proclaimed to all. And you
   know that I have not shunned to declare it in all its freeness and
   fullness. When we are giving the invitations of the Gospel that we find
   in the Scriptures, we never think of limiting them! Though we believe
   the special purpose of Christ's Atonement was the redemption of His
   Church, yet we know that His Sacrifice was Infinite in value and,
   therefore, we set the wicket gate as wide open as we can and we repeat
   Christ's own invitation, "Whoever will, let him take the wafer of life
   freely." Yet we do not flinch from the solemn Truth of God that none
   will ever be saved but those whom God foreknew and predestinated, whom
   in due time He calls, justifies and glorifies--and the great objective
   of the Gospel, whatever other ends it may have, is to gather together
   unto Christ these chosen ones who are to be His in the day when He
   makes up His jewels. I come into this pulpit and I trust that you, dear
   Friends, go forth to your various spheres of service with the
   comforting thought that we are not laboring in vain, or spending our
   strength for nothing--because there are some who must be saved, or, to
   use the expressive words of Paul concerning the rest which so many
   missed, "it remains that some must enter therein." We read concerning
   our Lord Jesus Christ, "He must go through Samaria," because there was
   one poor sinning woman there who was or-

   dained unto eternal life, as well as many others who, through her
   instrumentality, were to be brought to Christ and to believe on Him! We
   also must preach, or teach, or serve the Lord in other ways because it
   is written concerning Christ, "He shall see of the travail of His soul,
   and shall be satisfied." The Gospel is to be preached to every creature
   in order that Christ's chosen ones may be gathered unto Him. We cast
   the net into the sea, for we do not know where the fish are, but God
   knows and He guides into the net those He means us to catch for Him.
   You know that a magnet will attract steel to itself--well, the Gospel
   attracts souls that have an affinity to itself--and thus Christ draws
   His chosen ones unto Himself with the cords of a man, and bands of
   love!

   My next enquiry is, Who is to do this work of gathering Christ's chosen
   ones unto Himself. Brothers and Sisters in Christ, you know that every
   true child of God is to be employed in this blessed service! Some seem
   to think that this work devolves upon only ministers, or upon them and
   their Brothers in office--their deacons and elders--and that it is to
   extend no further. We hear much about, "lay agency" nowadays, but we
   know nothing of any distinction between "clergy" and "laity" in this
   matter! All God's people are God's kleros--God's clergy--or if there is
   any laity, any common people, all God's people are the laity, "a,
   peculiar people, zealous of good works." Nothing has been more
   disastrous to the cause of Christianity than the leaving of the service
   of Christ to comparatively few of His professed followers! We shall
   never see the world turned upside down, as it was in Apostolic times
   until we get back to the Apostolic practice and all the saints are
   filled with the Holy Spirit and speak for Christ as the Spirit gives
   them utterance! My dear Brother, surely you will not say, "I pray you
   have me excused from serving Christ." Remember your Lord's own words,
   "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come."
   Everyone who has heard and heeded the Gospel invitation is under a
   solemn obligation to repeat that invitation to others! Every Christian,
   whatever his talents, or abilities, or circumstances, or opportunities
   may be, should realize that he has a commission to help in gathering
   together Christ's saints unto Him. All are not required to do the same
   work, but each Believer is bound to do some work for the Master who has
   done so much for him. And everyone should enquire, "Lord, what will You
   have me to do."

   Some of you can distribute tracts, and there are some tracts that are
   worth distributing. I met with two, this afternoon, which will help me
   in my sermon. And if you get such tracts and give them away discreetly,
   they may be read and may benefit the readers. Some tracts are never
   likely to be read, but good, pithy, striking narratives--tracts with
   much of Christ and the Gospel in them--may be distributed with the
   prayerful confidence that a blessing will rest upon their perusal.
   There are some people who have special qualifications for this kind of
   work for Christ. While travelling last week, I was delighted to see at
   every station where the train stopped, a gentleman moving from carriage
   to carriage and offering a tract with the air of a man who was a
   practiced hand at the business! At a junction where some of us had to
   change, there were no less than four trains, and he was as busy as he
   could be giving his tracts to passengers in each train. I watched an
   American gentleman get out on to the platform and go up to the
   tract-distributor and begin to talk about the war and other topics--but
   very soon, the earnest servant of Christ had brought the conversation
   round to the subject of personal godliness. By-and-by, he came to me.
   He was glad to see a minister of the Gospel and I was glad to see him--
   and I hope that I might be as faithful in my sphere of service as that
   good man was in his!

   But some of you can go a little beyond tract-distributing. You can
   stand up at the corner of the street and preach the Gospel in a simple
   but earnest style. I thank God every time I remember the scores of
   young men we have here whose mouths have been opened to speak for
   Christ. Go, on, my brave sons, bearing your testimony for the Master!
   Even if the police should sometimes move you off, be content to be
   moved and go and blow the Gospel trumpet somewhere else! But take care
   to proclaim the good tidings of salvation, for you have your Lord's
   commission to do so! When a man receives a commission from the Queen,
   he is not a little proud of it. But you have a commission from the King
   of kings empowering you to gather together unto Him all who are
   included in the Covenant of His Grace!

   Those of you who are not able to preach may find opportunities of
   talking to individuals one by one. There is great power in
   "button-holing" people and speaking to them personally about their
   souls. Some of you can visit the sick and read and pray with them. Or
   you can look out for those in distress--the brokenhearted and hopeless
   ones who need to be directed to Him who alone can deliver and heal
   them. Try to say something for your Master wherever you go, remembering
   that He has sent even the humblest and feeblest of you to gather
   together unto Himself those who have made a covenant with Him by
   sacrifice.

   My third question is, Where are they to be gathered? The Lord says,
   "Gather My saints together unto Me." We are not told to gather them
   into the Baptist denomination, or into the Presbyterian kirk, or into
   the Episcopal establishment, or into any particular church! Our Lord's
   command is, "Gather My saints together unto Me." I have never been
   ashamed of being called a Baptist since I became one. And if I did not
   believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ordained the immersion of Believers
   on profession of their faith, I would not preach and practice it. But,
   dear as Christ's own ordinances ought always to be to all Christians,
   our main business is not to bring men and women to Baptism, but to
   bring them to Christ! Our principal objective is not even to bring
   people into Church membership, or to communion at the Lord's Table, but
   to bring them, by faith, to Calvary where the one great Sacrifice for
   sin was offered, where the precious blood of Jesus was shed, where His
   perfect righteousness was forever completed, where the tearful eyes may
   see the suffering Savior and where the broken heart may find healing
   and salvation in His grievous wounds! Labor, my beloved Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ, in all that you do or say, in your personal dealings
   with sinners, in your tracts, in your preaching, in your teaching, to
   set forth the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ--for so will you
   best obey your Lord's command, "Gather My saints together unto Me,
   those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."

   Perhaps someone asks, "Where are the chosen ones that are to be
   gathered unto Christ?"Where are they? Why, some of them may be sitting
   in the same pew where you now are! If you really want to gather
   Christ's saints together unto Him, begin with those who are close
   beside you now. If you want to bring Christ's chosen ones to Him, you
   can find some of them just outside this Tabernacle. You can find some
   of them as you are walking to your homes. You can find some of them in
   the streets, the courts and alleys all around us! You can find some of
   them in Whitechapel and others of them in the West End. I verily
   believe that missionaries of the Cross are just as much needed in
   Belgravia as in Shoreditch. And perhaps some who live in the biggest
   houses in the wealthiest parts of London are less likely to have the
   message of salvation carried to them than are multitudes of the poorer
   citizens of this great city! Then there are the people in our suburban
   towns and villages where so many neglect the ordinances of God's House,
   or have not the religious privileges which abound in this metropolis.
   And beyond them are great masses in the country for whom few or none
   are caring. And the almost innumerable hosts of heathens, Muslims and
   others in distant lands who have never yet even heard the name of Jesus
   and know nothing of the glorious Gospel which He commanded His servants
   to preach to them in His name! So dear Friends, wherever you may be,
   seek to gather some to Christ! Begin with those who are in this
   congregation now, or with those who are in your own household and then
   cease not from this blessed work as long as you live! As long as there
   is another jewel to be found to adorn Christ's crown--as long as there
   is another wandering sheep to be brought back to the Good Shepherd who
   bought it with His own blood--keep on at this blessed work in obedience
   to your Lord's command, "Gather My saints together unto Me, those that
   have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."

   II. Now, secondly, I want to show you that the text has a bearing upon
   THE GREAT GATHERING OF ALL THE

   CHOSEN AROUND THE THRONE OF CHRIST IN GLORY. In His intercessory prayer
   before He suffered, our Lord

   Jesus Christ prayed "Father, I will that they, also, whom You have
   given Me, be with Me where I am, that they may behold My Glory which
   You have given Me."And in the text Christ says to His servants in the
   heavens above and on the earth beneath, "Gather My saints together unto
   Me, those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."

   I ask again, as I asked in the previous part of my discourse, Who are
   to be gathered. They are those who have made a covenant with the Lord
   by sacrifice, and here I take the text to mean those who have made a
   personal covenant with God in Christ Jesus--those who, by an act of
   faith, have accepted the Covenant which Christ made with His Father on
   their behalf. This Covenant has been made by Sacrifice and through the
   mediation of the crucified Savior they have joined hands with the
   reconciled God. By His one offering, Christ "has perfected forever them
   that are sanctified," those who are set apart unto Him to be His
   sanctified ones, or, as the text calls them, His "saints." All of us
   who have been thus sanctified may boldly "enter into the Holiest by the
   blood of Jesus by a new and living way which He has consecrated for us,
   through the veil, that is to say, His flesh."

   Dear Friend, have you entered into this personal Covenant with God in
   Christ Jesus? Have you, by faith, made a personal appropriation of what
   Christ did upon the Cross when He suffered and died as the Substitute
   and Surety of all who trust in Him? If you are one of Christ's chosen
   ones, you will accept Him as your Savior. As long as you are content
   with your own doings and trust in them, you cannot be numbered among
   His saints. So--

   "Cast yourr deadly 'doing'down, Down at Jesus' feet! Stand in Him, in
   Him alone Gloriously complete!"

   "He that believes on Him is not condemned." Do you believe on Him? If
   you do, you are not condemned and, therefore, you are justified and you
   shall, in due time, be glorified and so you shall be among those who
   shall be gathered together unto Christ at the last. But the Lord
   expressly says, "Gather My saints together unto Me." Those who have
   repented of their sin and turned from it. Those who have been
   constrained by His Grace to live holy lives and who have entered into a
   covenant with Him to hate the sin that cost Him so much to redeem them
   from it!

   Now I repeat another question that I asked before, Where are these
   chosen ones to be gathered? Let me beg you again to look at that
   little, all-important word, "Me," in the text, "Gather My saints
   together unto Me." The Lord does not say, "Gather My saints together
   unto Heaven, to the general assembly and Church of the First-Born."
   They are to be gathered there, but He does not say so here. He says,
   "Gather My saints together unto Me." Is it not the very joy of Heaven,
   the quintessence of its bliss, that we are to be gathered unto Christ?
   It is very delightful to think of Heaven as the place of the perfect
   communion of saints, as the place of perfect worship, as the place of
   perfect rest and at the same time of constant unwearied activity--but,
   after all, though it may be a great comfort to us to think of Heaven
   under any of these aspects, yet it is a far sweeter thought to us to
   remember that Heaven is the place where Jesus is--and where His saints
   are to be gathered together unto Him! So with delight we sing--

   "There shall we see His face,

   And never, never sin!

   There from the rivers of His Grace,

   Drink endless pleasures in."

   The very glory of Heaven is that we shall see Him--that same Christ who
   once died upon Calvary's Cross--that we shall fall down and worship at
   His feet! No, more--that He shall kiss us with the kisses of His mouth
   and welcome us to dwell with Him forever! There are ineffable delights
   in the very name of Jesus! It is indeed like ointment poured forth!
   Then what unspeakable delights must there be in His Presence in Glory!
   If all His garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, what must
   Christ, Himself, be? For one glimpse of Him, I would give a life of
   broken bones, fever and every conceivable pang! No, more--I think I may
   even venture to say with Rutherford that if there were seven Hells
   between my soul and Christ--and He should bid me dash through them all,
   I would count the distance all too short if I might but get to Him at
   the last, to behold His face, and to dwell with Him forever! I do not
   know whether there are any degrees in Glory and I do not trouble about
   whether there are or are not--but this I do know, that all the saints
   shall be gathered together unto Christ--and that degree is high enough
   for any of them!

   How are these chosen ones to be gathered? The verse before our text
   tells us that the Lord shall call to the heavens from above and to the
   earth beneath, so we may be sure that the work which He commands shall
   be accomplished! We sometimes say of a man, when he is very determined
   to do a certain thing, "He will move Heaven and earth to do it." And
   Christ will move Heaven and earth to accomplish His great purpose of
   gathering together unto Himself all those that have made a covenant
   with Him by sacrifice! Heaven shall have a part in this great work. The
   angels are intensely interested in the saints who are to be their
   companions in Glory forever, for, "are they not all ministering
   spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of
   salvation?" God gives the holy angels charge over His saints to keep
   them in all their ways, and to bear them up in their hands lest they
   should dash their feet against the stones. And they act at last as a
   spiritual convoy escorting them to Heaven even as Lazarus "was carried
   by the angels into Abraham's bosom." Even Satan, himself, and all his
   hosts are under the supreme control of Christ. And He can use them as
   He pleases in the accomplishment of His purposes concerning His saints.
   At all events, they shall not be able to frustrate those purposes, but
   they shall most certainly be fulfilled. Earth, too, shall have its
   share in gathering Christ's chosen ones unto Him. Every wind that blows
   will speed them to their goal. Every wave shall wash them towards their
   desired haven. Everything that happens shall be overruled to the same
   end-- the gathering of Christ's saints together unto Him in Glory!

   Sometimes you and I lament when Christ's saints are gathered unto Him
   by death, but is not this wrong? They must go Home to Christ at some
   time or other, so why not go when God pleases and as God pleases? I do
   not know that I would pray for sudden death, though sudden death is, to
   a Believer in Christ, sudden Glory--but I certainly would not pray that
   I might not be called home suddenly. So far as I am personally
   concerned, I would like to have a similar expe-

   rience to that of good Dr. Beaumont who was preaching the Word on
   earth, and just as he finished uttering a sentence of his sermon, was
   singing the praises of God in Heaven! Or an experience like that of
   another minister, Brother Flood, whom I knew. He had just given out
   that verse--

   "Father, I long, I faint to see The place of Your abode. I'd leave Your
   earthly courts and flee Up to Your seat, My God"--

   when he fell back--for his desire was granted and he had gone from the
   earthly courts of the Lord's House up to the seat of God on high!
   Still, it does not matter how or when the saints are gathered unto
   Christ--whether by plague, or fever, or long lingering affliction,
   whether by accident on land or on the sea, or in any other way--they
   shall all be gathered together unto Him in due time! And when the
   muster-roll is called at the last, not one will be missing of all those
   that have made a covenant with Him by sacrifice!. The great question
   for all of us is shall we be among them? In order to answer that
   question, we must ask a few others. Have we entered into personal
   covenant relationship with God through relying upon Christ's Sacrifice
   upon the Cross? Have we repented of sin and trusted in Christ as our
   own personal Savior? Does He count us among His saints, those who are
   seeking, by His Grace, to live in righteousness and holiness before Him
   all our days? If so, then we may rest assured that we, too, shall be
   gathered unto Him with all those whom He has redeemed with His most
   precious blood!

   But what am I to say to those who cannot answer these questions
   satisfactorily? Possibly the tracts I mentioned in the earlier part of
   my discourse will help to give me a message to them. There may be some
   people here who have no hope, no good hope, concerning the hereafter.
   Perhaps you do not even believe in any hereafter! If so, just listen to
   this little narrative. "Some time ago, there lived in a certain market
   town a watchmaker, an honest, sober and industrious man, but he was an
   infidel. He did not believe in the Bible. He said that it was a book
   that was only fit for old women. As for what some said concerning the
   terrors of Hell, they never alarmed him--and as for what they said
   concerning the glories of Heaven, he reckoned they were only fancies or
   dreams. Suddenly, in the midst of life, he was stricken down and it was
   soon manifest that he was dying, and dying rapidly. On the day of his
   death, early in the morning, he began to say, 'I'm going, I'm going--I
   don't know where!' And then, as rapidly as he could speak, he
   continued, for the space of twelve or thirteen hours, to say the same
   words over and over and over again, 'I'm going, I'm going--I don't know
   where! I'm going, I'm going--I don't know where.' As his strength
   failed him, his voice became more weak and tremulous, but still his
   utterance was just the same, 'I'm going, I'm going--I don't know
   where.' And, at last, he died with those words upon his lips, 'I'm
   going, I'm going--I don't know where!'"

   O My dear Hearers, I do pray that this may not be the dying cry of any
   one of you, for if it is, the dreadful sequel is given in our Lord's
   declaration concerning the rich man, "in Hell he lifted up his eyes,
   being in torments." I cannot imagine anything in the whole work of the
   ministry that is more painful than trying to talk to those who have
   neglected Christ until the last hours of their lives and who, even
   then, feel no sorrow for sin, but pass out of this world into the next
   without the least ray of hope! There is, in my memory, a scene of this
   character which comes to me very vividly at this moment. Many years
   ago, when the cholera was raging in London, I was summoned, at three
   o'clock one morning, to go to a house near London Bridge where a man
   was very ill. He had been attacked by the cholera and knew that he must
   die. But although he was a godless, blasphemous man, he could think of
   no one but me whom he would like to see. So I had to be sent for in hot
   haste. I went to him, but he could do little more than express his
   horror at what was before him and his utter despair of any hope of
   escape. He asked me to pray, and I did so. But before I had finished,
   he was unconscious and soon he was in the pangs of death. I left him a
   corpse. I remember that for long afterwards I felt sad and grieved
   concerning the state of that man's soul. Yet, by nature, we were the
   children of wrath even as that man was--and but for Divine Grace, we
   might have spent our last day on earth as he did, in
   Sabbath-breaking-and our last hour of life in despair. God grant that
   we may always feel devoutly thankful for the Sovereign Grace that has
   made us to differ from others whom once we resembled, at least as far
   as this--that we were all, alike, the children of wrath!

   In the other tract I read about a working man who was passing by an
   infidel lecture hall. He stepped in, although he was a Christian and,
   as he entered, someone on the platform, who had the appearance of a
   gentleman, was saying that it was all nonsense for anyone to say that
   infidels died a miserable death. He had just been to see one of their
   number and he

   could assure them, on the word of a gentleman, that he had died very
   happily. When the speech was over, the working man asked whether he
   might be allowed to say something. "Yes," said the chairman, "certainly
   you may." So he rose and said, "I have just heard something that has
   greatly surprised me--I have heard of an infidel who has died happily.
   I have never before heard of such a thing as that happening, but as the
   speaker assured us, on the word of a gentleman, that it is true, I must
   not question the statement. I am, therefore, under the necessity of
   admitting that one infidel has died happily, but I feel sure that he
   must have lived a very miserable life, or else he could not have died
   so happily. Now I have a dear, loving wife, who makes my home right and
   cheerful. And when I come back from work, she always receives me with a
   smiling face and with my meals tastefully prepared. So I am sure that
   if I had to die and leave her--and to go I know not where--I could not
   die happily. I have four children--as smiling and happy children as you
   ever saw--and I love to hear their musical voices and their pretty
   prattle. But if I had to die and leave them--and to go I know not
   where--I could not die happily. So the only supposition that I can draw
   from the life of the man of whom this gentleman has told us is that he
   and his wife lived a cat-and-dog life, so that he was glad to be free
   from her at any cost. And that his children must have been so wicked or
   tiresome that he was glad to get away from them even though he did not
   know where he was going. My wife and children make me so happy that I
   do not want to leave them--and the only thing which makes me look
   forward to death without sorrow is the thought that I am going to a
   better world than this where there is One who loves me even more than
   my wife and children do, and where I hope one day to meet my dear ones
   again, to be parted from them no more forever."

   When I read that tract, I thought that the working man's reasoning was
   perfectly sound. And I wish that all of you, dear Friends, had just as
   good cause as he had to live happily and to die happily! You will have
   that if you will only trust in the same Savior in whom he trusted! May
   God the Holy Spirit enable you to do so now! This is the way of
   salvation. "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God."
   "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." He saves all who
   put their trust in Him! "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
   be saved." All who believe on Him are His chosen ones--His saints, as
   our text calls them--and those who truly trust Him are known by the
   holiness and gracious-ness of their lives! They are gathered unto Him,
   here, as they are, by His Grace, called out from the mass of mankind
   and, in God's good time, they shall all be gathered unto Him in that
   great general assembly and Church of the First-Born which are written
   in Heaven! May God grant that everyone of us may be there, for Jesus
   Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM50.

   A Psalm of Asaph.

   It is mentioned, in the life of Hezekiah, that "the king and the
   princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord with the
   words of David and of Asaph, the Seer," so that very likely this Psalm
   was sung in the Temple after it had been cleansed and reopened for
   worship. The first part of the Psalm contains a majestic prophecy of
   the Second Advent.

   Verses 1-3. The mighty God, even the LORD, has spoken, and called the
   earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof Out of
   Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined. Our God shall come and
   shall not keep silent; a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be
   very tempestuous round about Hi . He came once under the old legal
   dispensation and then, "there were thunders and lightning, and a thick
   cloud upon the mount...Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the Lord
   descended upon in it fire." And when Christ shall come, in the latter
   days, with equal splendor, there shall be fire and tempest to swell the
   pomp of His court.

   4. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He
   may judge His people. Heaven shall yield up the blessed who are already
   there, and earth shall give up those that are alive and remain until
   Christ's coming. And so "the whole company of the redeemed shall stand
   in the Presence of their great Lord and Savior when Christ shall come
   to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all them that
   believe." This is the summons that is to ring out to the heavens above
   and the earth beneath--

   5, 6. Gather My saints together unto Me, those that have made a
   covenant with Me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare His
   righteousness: for God is Judge, Himself Selah. Now the subject of the
   Psalm changes, but let not the Doctrine of the Second Advent pass from
   our thoughts. Christ will surely come again, but are we all prepared to
   meet

   Him? Shall we behold that glorious Appearance with joy or with sorrow?
   When He reigns gloriously with His ancients, shall we share in the
   splendors of that reign? Lord, call us to Yourself now! Help us to
   suffer with You now! Help us to bear reproach for You among men, now,
   and then, though--

   "It does not yet appear

   How great we must be made"--

   yet we know that--

   "When we see our Savor here, We shall be like our Head."

   Now the Lord addresses His own people--

   7. Hear, O My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify
   against you: I am God, even your God. Note, then, that with all the
   faults which Christ can find in His people, He is still their God! All
   the sins of the saints cannot separate them from Christ. They may blot
   the indenture, but it is only a copy of the Covenant made by Christ on
   their behalf-- the real title-deeds are in Heaven beyond all risk of
   loss. Sinner though you are, O child of Israel, yet God is still your
   God--and all your imperfections, follies and backslidings can never rob
   you of your eternal interest in Him!

   8-13. I will not reprove you for your sacrifices or your burnt
   offerings, to have been continually before Me. I will take no bullock
   out of your house, nor he goats out of your folds. For every beast of
   the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. Iknow all the
   fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine. IfI
   were hungry, I would not tell you: for the world is Mine, and the
   fullness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of
   goats? The Lord puts a slur upon the Levitical sacrifices in comparison
   with evangelical offerings. He sets prayer and praise before the blood
   of bulls or the sacrifices of goats! Yet we are not to understand that
   God despises the gifts of His people. If you give to God as though He
   needed your help, He will have none of it! But our gracious God is so
   condescending that although He needs nothing, He permits His people to
   bring their thank-offerings and to lay them at His feet. My God, will
   You accept a gift from me? Then I will not be slow to give it to You!
   Let everyone of us feel in his heart that though God needs nothing from
   us, yet we need the privilege of giving to Him.

   14, 15. Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay your vows unto the most
   High; and call upon Me in the day of

   trouble: I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me. [See Sermons
   #1505, Volume 25--PRAYER to god in trouble an acceptable sacrifice and
   #1876, Volume 31--ROBINSON CRUSOE'S TEXT.] See the three ways of

   praising God? One is by giving Him your grateful thanksgiving. Banish
   your murmurings. Sweep away your mistrusts and let your mouth be filled
   with His praise all the daylong! Then the next way of praising God is
   by paying your vows unto Him--let your constant prayers and offerings
   to God prove the gratitude of your heart. And the last and sweetest way
   of praising God is to call upon Him in the day of trouble. There are
   many of you who are in trouble at this moment, therefore call upon God!
   Perhaps you say, "That will benefit me, but how will it glorify Him?"
   Why, God gets much honor out of hearts that dare to trust Him! If you
   can cast your burden upon the Lord, you will as much honor Him as
   angels do when, with veiled faces, they cry, "Holy, holy, holy, is the
   Lord of Hosts: the whole earth is full of His Glory." We adore His
   wisdom, His faithfulness, His love, His Grace, His Truth, His power
   when we believe that in the darkest night He can bring us sudden
   daylight and that in the ebb tide of our affairs He can bring the
   floods back again. Christian, honor your God by calling upon Him! With
   all your difficulties, doubts and fears, call upon God and He will
   deliver you, and you shall glorify Him! Now comes another change--

   16. But unto the wicked God says, What have you to do to declare My
   statutes, or that you should take My Covenant in your mouth?
   Unconverted preachers, unsaved Sunday school teachers--what answer can
   you give to this question of the Most High?

   17-20. Seeingyou hate instruction, and cast My Words behindyou. When
   you saw a thief, then you consented with him and have been a partaker
   with adulterers. You give your mouth to evil and your tongue frames
   deceit You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own
   mother's son. Slander, you see, is put side by side with adultery and
   theft and, indeed, I do not know whether it is not the worst of the
   three! You might almost as well cut a man's throat as slander his
   character. You had better steal his purse than steal his good name.
   "What shall be given unto you? Or what shall be done unto you, you
   false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper." There
   are no coals hot

   enough to burn slanderous tongues! There are no punishments severe
   enough for those who slander their own mother's son.

   21. These things have you done and I kept silent. An amazing thing is
   that silence of God, that long-suffering with sinners! And another
   amazing thing is the impudent interpretation which the sinner gives to
   that silence!.

   21. You thought that I was altogether such an One as yourself: but I
   will reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes. "I will do
   what I have not yet done. If you think Me in arrears, I will clear
   myself with you soon. I will ease Me of My adversaries." When God
   arises in judgment, He may make it to be a slow work, but He will make
   it to be a sure work.

   22, 23. Now consider this, you that forget God, lest I tear you in
   pieces, and there be none to deliver. Whoever offers praise, glorifies
   Me: and to him that orders his conversation aright will I show the
   salvation of God. How blessed, then, is it to praise the Lord both with
   your lips and with your life!

An Earnest Warning Against Unbelief

   (No. 3217)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And to whom swore He that they should not enter into His rest, but to
   them that believed not? So we see that they could not enter in because
   of unbelief." Hebrews 8:18,19.

   ALL the histories of Scripture are written for our examples, but
   especially the story of the Israelites in the wilderness, which is
   given to us at a length far exceeding the value of the narrative unless
   it is intended for purposes of spiritual instruction, for it occupies
   four books of the Old Testament and those, by no means, short ones!
   These things were written that we might see ourselves in the Israelites
   as in a mirror--and so might be warned of dangers common to us and to
   them--and be guided to a worthier use of the privileges which we enjoy.
   Always read Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy with this
   view--"This is the story of the Church of God in the wilderness--I
   would see how God dealt with them and how they dealt with Him, and from
   this learn lessons that may be useful to me in my own pilgrimage to the
   eternal rest."

   The great promise which was given to Israel was Canaan, that choice
   land which God had of old allotted to them. "When the Most High divided
   to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the sons of Adam,
   He set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children
   of Israel." He made Palestine to be the center of worship, the joy of
   all lands, the seat of His oracle and the place of His abode. In the
   wilderness the tribes were journeying towards this country and it was a
   very short distance from Egypt, so that they might almost at once have
   taken possession of the land, and yet it cost them forty years'
   travelling! If you trace their travels, you will see that they ran a
   perpetual zigzag, backward and forward, to the right and to the left.
   Sometimes they were actually journeying away from the promised rest,
   plunging into the deeps of the howling wilderness--and all, we are
   told, because of their unbelief! The land itself flowed with milk and
   honey. It was a land of brooks and rivers, a land upon the surface of
   which all choice fruits would grow, and out of whose bowels they could
   dig copper and iron. It was the choicest of all lands and will yet
   again become so when there is an end of the accursed rule which now
   makes it desolate. Once more, under decent, settled rule and properly
   irrigated, it will again bloom and become such a country as all the
   world besides cannot match! This was the promised land and into it they
   were to enter--and there to multiply and increase as the stars of
   Heaven--and to be a nation of kings and priests unto God. But "they
   could not enter in because of unbelief." This, alone, shut them out.

   Brothers and Sisters, Canaan is a type to us of the great and goodly
   things of the Covenant of Grace which belong to Believers. But if we
   have no faith, we cannot possess a single Covenant blessing! This day,
   in the proclamation of the Gospel, the demand is made of faith in God.
   And if there is no faith, no matter how rich the Gospel, how full its
   provisions and how precious the portion which God has prepared, none of
   us can ever enter into the enjoyment of them!

   Some of you, because of unbelief, have not entered into the rest which
   God gives to His people even here below ("for we which have believed do
   enter into rest") and into the rest which remains--the blessed Sabbath
   of the skies--you will not be able to enter because of unbelief. This
   pains and troubles me, but so it is. Moses wrote a mournful Psalm which
   began, "Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations," and
   then he went on to weep and bewail the transitory nature of man's
   estate. He wrote it while he was seeing forty funerals, at least, every
   day, for it required an average of forty deaths per diem to carry off
   all the people that came out of Egypt in the forty years. Their days
   were spent in bewailing the dead so that it was true of them as it is
   not true of us, "All our days are passed away in Your wrath." They had
   to mourn and sigh with Canaan but a little way ahead! They might have
   been laughing in its glades, sunning themselves in its plains, feasting
   on its figs and grapes and corn, but instead, there they were--pining
   and dying, digging

   graves and expiring--for "they could not enter in because of unbelief."
   Many, many, many this day are tormenting themselves with needless
   despondency, shivering in fears they need not know and vexed with
   plagues they need not feel because they fail to rest in Christ through
   unbelief! Alas, myriads more are descending into the lake that burns
   with fire and they know no rest--and never shall know any! For them the
   harps of angels never sound! For them the white robes are not prepared
   because the unbelieving must have their portion in the Lake of Fire!
   Oh, that God would now deliver them from this dreadful sin of unbelief!

   I have only three remarks to make. And the first is that these were a
   highly-favored people, yet they could not enter in because of unbelief
   Secondly, that the sole and only thing, according to the text, which
   shut them out was unbelief And that, thirdly, there were other people,
   their own sons and daughters, who, being delivered from this unbelief,
   did enter in. That must have made the case more clear against them
   because their little ones, who they said should be prey, were,
   nevertheless, permitted, each one, to stand in his lot. God's purpose
   was not frustrated because of man's unbelief! "If we believe not, yet
   He abides faithful: He cannot deny Himself."

   I. First, then--THESE WERE A HIGHLY-FAVORED PEOPLE, YET THEY COULD NOT
   ENTER IN BECAUSE OF UNBELIEF.

   Mark you, this was not said of Egyptians, Amorites or Philistines! No,
   it was said of Israelites who occupied the position of those who, in
   the New Testament, are called the "children of the kingdom"--many of
   whom will be cast out. These are the persons to whom it may be truly
   said, "Be you sure of this, that the Kingdom of God is come near unto
   you." The dust of the feet of God's servants will be shaken off against
   you, but yet you have heard the message of mercy and you have been as
   highly favored as Bethsaida and Chorazin when they heard the Word of
   God which, through its rejection, worked for them a more intolerable
   doom!

   Now, think of it. These Israelites had seen great wonders worked. These
   men were in Egypt during those marvelous plagues. What times to live
   in, when they heard of miracle after miracle, peals of God's great
   thunder when He made His storm to beat about the head of proud Pharaoh!
   These men had seen the waters turned into blood and the fish floating
   dead upon the stream. They had seen the diseases on the cattle and the
   great hailstones which destroyed the harvest. They had been in the
   light when all the Egyptians were in the darkness that might be felt!
   They had seen the plagues of locusts and of lice--and all the terrors
   of the Lord when Jehovah took arrow after arrow out of His quiver and
   shot them against the hard heart of Pharaoh. They had all eaten of the
   paschal lamb on that dread night when Egypt sorely wept because the
   chief of all their strength had been killed in all the dwellings of the
   sons of Ham! They had gone out with their kneading-troughs in haste to
   escape from the land of bondage--brought forth with a high hand and an
   outstretched arm. These very men had been with Moses when Pharaoh
   pursued them and when that lifted rod split the Red Sea and Israel
   found an open channel where of old the waves had perpetually rolled!
   They had marched through the depths as through the wilderness and they
   had seen the eager waters leap back again into their place and drown
   all Egypt's chivalry! They had heard the song of Miriam, "Sing you to
   the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has
   He thrown into the sea." Yet "they could not enter in because of
   unbelief."

   And, oh, Brothers and Sisters, there are some among you who have seen
   great marvels worked by God! You have known the gift of His dear Son so
   as to be assured of the fact--and to see it with your mind's
   eyes--though you have not believed unto salvation. You know what God
   has worked for His people! You know how He delivered them and saved
   them by the blood of His Son. You have been present when the power of
   the Lord has swept through the audience as the wind sweeps through the
   forest and breaks the cedars of Lebanon! You have known the mighty
   works which God has done in the midst of the congregation! Your eyes
   have seen them and your fathers have also told you of the wondrous
   things which He did in their day and in the old time before them! And
   yet, with all this before you, and your mother in Heaven, and your
   sister in the Church of God, and your friends saved, you cannot enter
   in because of unbelief! Ah, the Lord will not have mercy upon you
   because of what you have seen, for so much light is but an aggravation
   of the guilt of your unbelief! And, instead of pleading in your favor,
   it demands justice on those that believe not after all they have seen!

   To these Israelites great things had been revealed, for during their
   sojourn in the wilderness, they had been scholars in a gracious school.
   You, yourselves, have marvelled that they did not learn more. What
   glorious marches those were through the wilderness when the mountains
   saw You, O God, and they trembled when Sinai was altogether on a smoke!
   To what other people did God ever speak as He spoke to them? To whom
   did He give the tablets of Divine Command-

   ments written with His own mysterious pen? Where else did He dwell
   between the cherubim and shine forth with glorious majesty? Where else
   did He reveal Himself in type and shadow, by priest and sacrifice and
   altar? Where else was heard so sweetly holy Psalms and daily prayer?
   Where else smoked the morning and the evening lamb, God teaching by all
   these? And yet, when they heard, they provoked! When they were taught,
   they refused to learn! When they were called, they went not after Him.
   Their hearts were hardened and they believed not the Lord their God!

   We too, have enjoyed a clear Revelation. We have heard the Gospel more
   plainly than the Israelites ever did. This blessed Book has more light
   in it than Moses could impart and the preaching of the Gospel, where it
   is done affectionately and earnestly, and by the help of the Spirit of
   God, is a greater means of Grace to the soul than all the sacred rites
   of the tabernacle! Shall it be with us as with them? "They could not
   enter in because of unbelief"--shall we labor under the same
   disability? Sharers in solemn feasts and yet their carcasses fell in
   the wilderness! Partakers of countless blessings, favored with the
   Light of God and yet shut out from Jehovah's rest because they believed
   not! Will this also be our portion?

   Remember, also, that they were a people with whom God had great
   patience. Has it ever struck you--the great patience which must have
   been exercised in 40 years of provocation? I put it to any man here who
   has a good temper and is very calm and cool and singularly
   forgiving--how long could you stand provocation? Brother, if they did
   always provoke you intentionally, willfully and repeatedly, how long
   could you bear it? Ah, you could not be provoked one-half as long as
   you think you could, without, at least, coming to blows. When Jesus
   said to His disciples that if a brother should trespass against them
   seven times in a day, and seven times a day should turn and say, "I
   repent," they should forgive him--the very next thing we read is that
   the Apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith," as much as to say,
   "Flesh and blood can never attain to that, Lord! You must increase our
   faith if we are to do that." But forty years 'provocation--what do you
   think that can do? Some men bear provocation well because they cannot
   return it, on the principle mentioned in Cowper's ballad--

   "So stooping down, as needs he must Who cannot sit upright"

   But when a man knows his power to end the provocation and to deliver
   himself, he is not so slow to ease him of his adversary. See the
   gentleness of the Lord! Forty years He is provoked! One would have
   thought that, surely, in that time these people would turn and repent.
   Moses, himself, I think, in the greatest agony of his prayer, could
   only have said, "Lord, give them 12 months in which they may mend their
   ways." That gracious intercessor who is mentioned in the parable of the
   fig tree only said, "Let it alone this year, also." That was all. But
   this was forty years A fruitless tree standing for 40 years! Why
   cumbers it the ground? Oh, the stupendous mercy of God! But they could
   not enter into His rest after all. Will it be the same with you who
   have heard the Gospel for many years? What is to become of you? When so
   much patience is lost upon you, what must happen next? I scarcely feel
   as if I can pity you. I seem as if I pitied God that He has borne your
   indifference so long as the only return for His great love! In what
   manner has He acted that you should so ungenerously treat Him and
   continue to provoke Him? I fear it will, before long, be said of you,
   "they could not enter in because of unbelief."

   Once more, only, on this point. These people had also received great
   mercies. It was not merely what they had seen, what they had been
   taught and the long-suffering they had enjoyed--they had received very
   remarkable favors. They drank of the Rock which followed them. And the
   manna fell every morning fresh from Heaven for them. Men did eat
   angels' food! They had a cloudy pillar to guide and shield them by
   day--and that same pillar at night became a light of fire and so lit up
   the canvas city all night long. The Lord was a wall of fire round about
   them and a glory in their midst! Will you think, dear Friend, what God
   has done for you from your childhood until now? Perhaps you found
   yourself upon a mother's lap and she was singing of Jesus. And as you
   grew up, you dwelt in a family circle where that dear name was a
   household word. By-and-by, you were led to a godly teacher to be taught
   more about Jesus. And since then you have heard from the pastor's
   mouth, a message which he tries to steep in love whenever he delivers
   it. Then think of the lord's gracious Providence. You have been fed and
   cared for. Perhaps you have been brought very low, but you have had
   food and raiment. Others are pining in the workhouse and you have,
   probably, a competence--or you are in health and are able to earn your
   livelihood. And in times of sickness, God hears you and keeps you from
   death. You have been preserved in accidents and here you are, kept
   alive with death so near! Will you not turn unto the Lord? For if not,
   He will not al-

   ways spare you. Earth feels your weight too much for her and almost
   asks God to let her open a grave for the wretch who refuses to love His
   Creator! Time, itself, is getting impatient of your sin and hurrying on
   the hour when your allotted span will be over--and you will be forced
   into a dread eternity! O Soul, Soul, highly-favored as you are, it
   seems so sad a thing that of you it should be said, "He could not enter
   in," or, "she could not enter in"--"because of unbelief."

   II. And now a few words upon our second head. NOTHING BUT UNBELIEF SHUT
   THEM OUT. "They could not enter in because of unbelief."

   It was not through great sin in other respects although they were a
   sinful people. God was ready to forgive them everything else but
   unbelief. And had they been but willing and obedient, the times of
   their ignorance He would have winked at. He had provided sacrifices on
   purpose to take away sins of ignorance and multitudes of other sins,
   but nothing takes away the sin of unbelief, as long as it remains in
   the heart. You must be Believers, or the blood of Jesus Christ, itself,
   shall never be sprinkled upon you to your cleansing! However great your
   sins may have been, all manner of sin and iniquity shall be forgiven
   you if you believe. The greatness of your sin shall not shut you out of
   Heaven--only unbelief will stop the way.

   Neither, my dear Brothers and Sisters, would their other evil
   tendencies have kept them out of Canaan. God knew what they were. They
   had been a race of slaves in Egypt and it is not easy for a nation,
   long in bondage, to rise to the dignity of freedom--the Israelites in
   the wilderness were people of a low type, much degraded by slavery--and
   God was therefore lenient with them. Many laws He did not make because
   He knew they would not keep them--and there were some things which He
   permitted them which could not be permitted us. "Moses, because of the
   hardness of your hearts, permitted you to put away your wives," said
   Jesus. The Lord was very gentle towards their moral weakness and bore
   with them as a nurse with her children. But when it came to unbelief--a
   doubt of Him who was so clearly God, a denial of His power, His
   faithfulness, His Truth--then they were shut out of Canaan as with an
   iron gate.

   My Brothers and Sisters, they were not unbelieving from lack of
   evidence, yet they had not more than you have, because most of you have
   abundant evidence of the truth of the Gospel. The Bible to you has been
   God's Book from your childhood and you take its Inspiration for granted
   and it is, therefore, inexcusable if you do not trust Christ! If a
   man's skepticism includes a doubt of the existence of God, or the truth
   of Scripture, we will talk to him another time. But with most of you
   there are no such questions, and the Lord Jesus might well demand of
   you, "If I tell you the truth, why do you not believe Me?" If before
   the Judgment Seat of Christ a man shall be forced to confess, "I
   believe the Bible to be God's Word," I cannot imagine the apology which
   he can frame in his heart for not having believed in Jesus Christ! To
   you, then, there is no lack of evidence--and if you are shut out of
   Heaven, your own willful unbelief must bear the blame!

   The Israelites were not unbelieving from lack of encouragement for as I
   have already shown you, the Lord sweetly encouraged them to believe in
   Him by the great things He did for them and by His gentle dealings day
   by day. Most of you have been gently persuaded and encouraged to trust
   in the Lord Jesus. How blessedly the Word of God has worded its
   invitations so as to suit the timorousness of poor trembling sinners!
   And as a preacher, I can honestly say that I lay out all my wits to
   think of Truths of God which might cheer desponding souls! God, who
   abounded to me in all goodness and mercy and is bringing me tenderly to
   His feet, has made me long after souls that I may bring them to Him! If
   you have not believed, it has not been for lack of invitations,
   expostulations, encouragements and words of consolation. No, you will
   not be able to blame the Bible or the preacher! Unbelief of the most
   wanton kind will be chargeable to you and will shut you out of God's
   rest!

   Nor would it have been true if the Israelites had said that they could
   not enter in because of difficulties. There was the Jordan before them
   and when they entered the land, there were cities walled to Heaven, and
   giants before whom they felt like grasshoppers. Yes, but that did not
   hinder them, for God divided the Jordan, made the walls of Jericho to
   fall flat to the ground and sent the hornets before them to chase out
   the giants! Israel had little more to do than to go up and take the
   spoil!

   Now, Soul, there is no difficulty between you and eternal life which
   Christ either has not removed already or will not remove as you believe
   in Him. As for your iniquities, when you believe, they are gone--the
   Jordan is divided. As for your inbred sins, He will surely drive them
   out, little by little, when you believe in Him. As for your old habits,
   which are like the high walls of the Canaanite cities, they shall fall
   down at the sound of the ram's horn of faith! Only believe and you

   shall enter into rest! Trust in God, and impossibilities shall vanish
   and difficulties shall become a blessing to you. Nothing hinders you
   except that you will not believe. And if you will not believe, neither
   shall you be established. "If you believe not," says Christ, "that I am
   He, you shall die in your sins." "This is the condemnation, that light
   is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light." This
   is the sin of which I pray the Spirit of God to convict you--"Of sin
   because they believe not on Me."

   III. The third head is that SOME DID ENTER IN. These were their own
   children and I have been wondering whether if I should preach in vain
   to a whole generation of those who reject Christ, I might yet hope that
   their children would rise up to call the Redeemer blessed! Dear young
   man, do not follow in your unbelieving father's footsteps! Dear girl,
   do not imitate the indecision, the limping between two opinions which
   you have seen in your mother! If her carcass must fall in the
   wilderness, there is no reason why yours should. Is it not a great
   mercy that the Lord does not reject us because of the sins of our
   fathers? Though you were a child of shame, yet you may be a child of
   Divine Grace! Though your pedigree were dishonorable, your end may be
   glorious! If the history of your ancestors is full of unbelief and
   rejection of the Lord, yet this need be no reason why you should perish
   with them!

   Look at the effect of this upon the fathers, as they looked upon their
   sons and said, "That boy of mine will have a house and home in the holy
   land, but I must die in the desert. That girl of mine will be among the
   merry wives that make joy in Eshcol and that go up to the house of the
   Lord in Zion--but I must be buried in this waste of sand, for the Lord
   has sworn in His wrath that I shall not enter into His rest." Fathers
   and mothers, how do these things suit you? I am sure if it were my lot
   to see my boys rejoicing in the Lord while I was an unbeliever and
   could not enter in because of unbelief, I could not bear it! I could
   not bear it! How I wish that your children would entice you to Christ!
   I have known it happen by the influence of dear departing infants. Many
   a time the Lord has taken a babe away from its mother's breast, to her
   grief at first, but to her salvation in the end! The shepherd could not
   get the sheep to follow till he took up its lamb and carried it in his
   bosom--then the mother would go wherever he liked. Perhaps the Lord has
   done that with some of you on purpose that you may follow Him. Do you
   want Him to come and take another little one? Ah, He may, for He loves
   you! If one is not enough, He may take another till, at last, you
   follow the Shepherd's call. If you will not follow Jesus, you cannot
   enter where your babes have gone! Unbelieving Mother, you shall not see
   the heavenly field wherein your little lambs are resting--you are
   divided from them forever! Unbelieving Father, you cannot follow your
   sons--your believing offspring are with God, but you must be cast out
   from His Presence. Can you endure this?

   O, impenitent Sinner, do you not know that God's purpose shall not be
   frustrated? If you will not have Christ, others will! If you will not
   come to the banquet of His love, He will gather the wanderers and the
   outcasts, for His wedding shall be furnished with guests! As surely as
   the Lord lives, Christ shall not die in vain! Heaven shall not be empty
   and the sacred orchestra of the skies shall not lack musicians! If you
   count yourselves unworthy, others whom you have despised shall be
   welcomed to the feast of love! Harlots and outcasts, His mighty Grace
   will save--but you, the children of the kingdom--shall be cast into
   outer darkness where weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth are
   heard! Can you bear it? Can you bear to think of it? If you can, I
   cannot! When I think of any of my hearers perishing, I feel like Hagar
   when she could not help her child and, therefore, laid him under the
   bushes and went away saying, "Let me not see the death of the child!"
   One of you lost? One of you lost? It is too much for me to think of!
   Yet to many of you the Gospel has been preached in vain, for the
   hearing of it has not been mixed with faith. The Lord have mercy upon
   you!

   To me it is especially appalling that a man should perish through
   willfully rejecting the Divine salvation. A drowning man throwing away
   his lifebelt, a poisoned man pouring the antidote upon the floor, a
   wounded man tearing open his wounds--any one of these is a sad
   sight--but what shall we say of a soul putting from it the
   Redeemer--and choosing its own destruction? O Souls, be warned and
   forbear from eternal suicide! There is still the way of salvation--
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." To believe
   is to trust. I met with one the other night who had imbibed the notion
   that saving faith was simply to believe that the Doctrines of the Word
   of God and the statements therein made are true. Now faith
   includesthat, but it is much more! You may believe all this Book to be
   true, and be lost notwithstanding your belief! You must so believe it
   as to act upon it by trusting. "Trust what?" you ask. Let us alter the
   question before we answer it. "Trust Whom" You have to trust in a
   living Person--in the Lord Jesus Christ who died as the Substitute for
   those who trust Him--and lives to see that those whom He bought with
   blood are also redeemed

   from their sins by power and brought home to Heaven. Trust Jesus
   Christ, Soul! Have done with yourself as your confidence and commit
   your soul unto the keeping of the faithful Redeemer!

   Have you done so? Then, even if the clock has not ticked once since you
   believed in Jesus Christ, you are as surely saved as if you had been a
   saint these 20 years, for he that believes in Him is not condemned!
   This declaration makes no stipulation as to time. "There is therefore
   now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." God grant that you may obey
   the heavenly precept, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HEBREWS 2f 3.

   Hebrews 2:1. Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
   things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.
   That is to say, because Jesus is so great, because the Truths which He
   came to reveal are so infinitely important, "therefore we ought to give
   the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any
   time we should let them slip." For sometimes, we seem to let them slip.
   We grow old. Our mind is dull. Our heart is occupied with other matters
   and we let these heavenly things leak out, or drift by us, as if we
   were not concerned in them.

   2, 3. For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every
   transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;
   how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?'Listen! "How
   shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?" Not if we resist
   it, reject it, despise it, oppose it--but if we neglectit! If a man is
   in business, it is not necessary that he should commit forgery in order
   to fail--he can fail by simply neglecting his business. If a man is
   sick, he need not commit suicide by taking poison--he can do it just as
   surely by neglecting to take proper medicines! So is it in the things
   of God--neglect is as ruinous as distinct and open opposition! "How
   shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?"

   3, 4. Which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
   confirmed unto us by them that heard Him; God also bearing them
   witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and
   gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?'Observe, then,
   that this Gospel comes to us by Christ and it is confirmed to us by His
   Apostles, and further confirmed by those signs and wonders, and divers
   miracles which God sent as the seals of Apostolic teaching! So that
   this spell is not one about which we can raise any question
   whatever--it comes by a Medium which we must not dare to question--it
   has confirming seals in it which it is blasphemous for us to dispute!
   Oh, how gladly should we receive it! How tenderly should we treat it!
   How devoutly grateful should we be for it and how earnestly should we
   comply with all its requirements!

   5. For unto the angels has He not put in subjection the world to come,
   whereof we speak God has not made angels to be the preachers of the
   Gospel. Doubtless they derive some happiness from it, if only from the
   sight of those converted under it, but it is in no sense under the
   government of angels.

   6-8. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that
   You are mindful of him? Or the son of man, that You visit him? You made
   him a little lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and
   honor, and did set him over the works of Your hands: You have put all
   things in subjection under his feet It is so, in a measure, in the
   natural world. Man is made to be the master of it--and the ox and the
   horse, with all their strength--must bow their necks to man. And the
   lion and the tiger, with all their ferocity, must still be cowed in the
   presence of their master. Yet this is not a perfect kingdom which we
   see in the natural world. But, in the spiritual world, man is still to
   be supreme for the present and, therefore, Christ becomes not an angel,
   but a man! He takes upon Him that nature which God intends to be
   dominant in this world and in that which is to come.

   8. For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing that
   is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under
   him.We see not yet man the master of everything. Not even Christ, the
   model Man, the Head of all men. While He was here below, He was not a
   ruling Lord, but a suffering Servant. He said to His disciples, "I am
   among you as He that serves." Yet it is in Him that the dominion once
   given to man is to be seen most clearly displayed.

   9. But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
   the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor We see that by
   faith. We see Jesus not merely as God, but as the God-Man exalted "far
   above all principality and power, and might, and dominion."

   9, 10. That He, by the Grace ofGod, should taste death for everyman.
   Forit became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,
   in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their
   salvation perfect through

   sufferings. [See Sermon #2619, Volume 45--THE CAPTAIN OF OUR
   SALVATION.]

   Not that Christ needed to be made perfect in Nature, but perfect in His
   capacity to be the Captain of our salvation-- complete in all the
   offices which He sustains toward His redeemed people. He must be a
   Sufferer that He may be a Sympathizer--and hence His sufferings made
   Him perfect.

   11. For both He that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of
   one. [See Sermon #2418, Volume 41--"all of one."] He who sets them
   apart and they who are set apart "are all of

   one." They are of one nature and they have one destiny before them.

   11. For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren. Does not
   this bring very sweetly before you the close relationship of Christ to
   His people? He has espoused their nature and He acknowledges it by
   calling then brethren!

   12. Saying, I will declare Your name unto My brethren, in the midst of
   Your church will I sing praise unto You. The Apostle was writing to
   Hebrews and, therefore, he quoted from the books with which they were
   familiar. He here quotes the 22nd Psalm as the words of the Messiah.

   13. And again, I will put My trust in Him. And again, Behold Iand the
   children which God has given Me. There are some passages which we
   should never have thought related to the Messiah if the New Testament
   had not told us that they do. Hence I have no doubt that we much more
   often err in not seeing Christ in the Old Testament than in seeing Him
   there, for there may be many other passages besides these which are
   supposed to speak of Christ which do speak of Him.

   14. Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He
   also Himself likewise took part of the same, that through death He
   might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. [See
   Sermon #166, Volume 4--the destroyer DESTROYED.] By His own death,
   Christ broke that evil

   power which brought death into the world with its long trail of woe! He
   did this, not by His example, not even by His life, but by His death!
   Therefore let those who speak slightingly of His atoning Sacrifice see
   their folly, for it is through death that Christ destroys "him that had
   the power of death, that is, the devil."

   15. 16. And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
   lifetime subject to bondage. For verily He took not on Him the nature
   of angels, but He took on Him the seed of Abraham. [See Sermon #90,
   Volume 2--men chosen--fallen angels REJECTED.] Christ's great mission
   was not to save angels, but

   to save men. Therefore He came not in the nature of angels, but in the
   nature of men.

   17, 18. Therefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto
   His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in
   things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
   people. For in that He Himself has suffered being tempted, He is able
   to succor them that are tempted. "And this is the reason why He
   suf-fered--and why He became a man capable of suffering--that He might
   be able to succor the tempted. It was for this that Christ left Heaven,
   for this He was born of the virgin, for this He lived and for this He
   died, that He might be "able to

   succor them that are tempted." [See Sermons #487, Volume 9--A TEMPTED
   SAVIOR--OUR BEST SUCCOR; #1974, Volume 33--THE SUFFERING SAVIOR'S
   SYMPATHY and #2885, Volume 50--CHRIST'S SYMPATHY WITH HIS PEOPLE.]

   Hebrews 3:1. Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly
   calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ
   Jesus.Think of Him, think how great He is, think what attention He
   deserves from all who believe in Him!

   2-6. Who was faithful to Him that appointed Him, as also Moses was
   faithful in all his house. For this Man was counted worthy of more
   glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who has built the house has more honor
   than the house. For every house is built by one man; but He that built
   all things is God. And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a
   servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
   but Christ as a Son over His own house. See the superiority of Christ
   over Moses--Moses is honored by being called the servant of God, but
   Jesus is the Son of God, and as Son, Master over His own house.

   6. Whose house are we. Christ built the house. He laid us together like
   stones upon the great foundation. Moses is but a caretaker in the
   house.

   6. If we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm
   unto the end. Final perseverance is an absolute necessity of a child of
   God. We do not prove ourselves to be a part of the house if we move
   about like loose stones!

   7-10. Why (as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you will hear His voice,
   harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation
   in the wilderness: when your fathers tempted Me, proved Me and saw My
   works forty years. Therefore I was grieved with that generation, and
   said, They do always err in their heart; and they have not known My
   ways. Do not provoke your God by your quibbling, or your murmuring, or
   your idolatry--act not as those unbelievers did who died in the
   wilderness.

   11, 12. So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest).
   Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you

   an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God [See Sermon
   #2552, Volume 44--"TAKE HEED, BRETHREN."] There was that "evil heart"
   in the Israelites--is there not a danger that it may be in you, also,
   who are partakers of the like nature?

   13. But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of
   you be hardened through the deceitfulness of

   sill. [See Sermon #620, Volume 116--A WARNING AGAINST HARDNESS OF
   HEART.]

   If sin came to you openly proclaiming itself as sin, you would fight
   against it. But it is very cunning and deceitful and it gradually
   petrifies the heart and especially the heart of those who think that
   they will never provoke God by their sin. Pride has already begun to
   work in them--and where pride can work, every other sin finds
   elbowroom. God save us from the deceitfulness of sins!

   14. For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our
   confidence steadfast unto the end [See Sermon

   #1042, Volume 18--A PERSUASIVE TO STEADFASTNESS.] You are to hold

   fast, to hold on and to hold out to the end--and the Grace you need in
   order to do this is waiting for you if you will but look for it and
   daily live under the power of it!

   15. 16. While it is said, Today if you willhear His voice, harden not
   your hearts as in the provocation. For some, when they had heard, did
   provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. All but two
   that came out of Egypt died in the wilderness--only Joshua and Caleb
   were found faithful among the faithless.

   17. But with whom was He grieved forty years? Was it not with them that
   had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?See how the Apostle
   speaks of them! He does not say that their bodies were buried, but that
   their carcasses fell in the wilderness! Unbelief degrades us into
   beasts whose carcasses fall beneath the battle-axe of Judgment. Oh,
   that we might all be rid of unbelief--that degrading, desecrating,
   defiling, destroying thing!

   18, 19. And to whom swore He that they should not enter into His rest
   but to them that believed not? So we see that they could not enter in
   because ofunbelief.lt was not the sons Anak that kept them out! It was
   not the waste howling wilderness! It was nothing but their own
   unbelief!

Preaching Christ Crucified

   (No. 3218)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 23, 1863.

   "But we preach Christ crucified." 1 Corinthians 1:23.

   IN the verse preceding our text, Paul writes, "The Jews require a
   sign." They said, "Moses worked miracles; let us see miracles worked
   and then we will believe," forgetting that all the wonders that Moses
   worked were altogether eclipsed by those which Jesus worked while He
   was upon the earth in the flesh. Then there were certain Judaizing
   teachers who, in order to win the Jews, preached circumcision, exalted
   the Passover and endeavored to prove that Judaism might still exist
   side by side with Christianity--and that the old rites might still be
   practiced by the followers of Christ. So Paul, who was made all things
   to all men that he might by all means save some, put his foot down and
   said, in effect, "Whatever others may do, we preach Christ
   crucified--we dare not, we cannot and we will not alter the great
   subject matter of our preaching, Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.

   Then he added, "and the Greeks seek after wisdom." Corinth was the very
   eyes of Greece and the Corinthian Greeks sought after what they
   regarded as wisdom--that is to say, the wisdom of this world, not the
   wisdom of God which Paul preached! The Greeks also treasured the memory
   of the eloquence of Demosthenes and other famous orators. And they
   seemed to think that true wisdom must be proclaimed with the graces of
   masterly elocution--but Paul writes to these Corinthian Greeks, "I
   determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him
   crucified. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words
   of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that
   your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of
   God."

   Now, in these days there are some who would be glad if we would preach
   anything except Christ crucified! Perhaps the most dangerous among them
   are those who are continually crying out for intellectual preaching, by
   which they mean preaching which neither the heavens nor the preachers,
   themselves, can comprehend--the kind of preaching which has little or
   nothing to do with the Scripture and which requires a dictionary rather
   than a Bible to explain it! These are the people who are continually
   running about and asking, "Have you heard our minister? He gave us a
   wonderful discourse last Sunday morning! He quoted Hebrew, Greek and
   Latin. He gave us some charming pieces of poetry--in fact it was
   altogether an intellectual treat!" Yes, and I have usually found that
   such intellectual treats lead to the ruination of souls. That is not
   the kind of preaching that God generally blesses to the salvation of
   souls and, therefore, even though others may preach the philosophy of
   Plato or adopt the arguments of Aristotle, we preach Christ crucified,
   the Christ who died for sinners, the people's Christ and, "we preach
   Christ crucified" in simple language, in plain speech such as the
   common people can understand!

   I am going to try to put our text into practice by telling you, first,
   what we preach Secondly, to whom we preach it And, thirdly, how we
   preach it

   I. First of all, WHAT WE PREACH. Paul is the model for all preachers
   and he says, "We preach Christ crucified."

   In order to preach the Gospel fully, there must be a very clear
   description of the Person of Christ, and we preach Christ as God--not a
   man made into a God, nor a God degraded to the level of a man, not
   something between a man and a God, but, "very God of very God." He is
   One with His Father in every attribute--eternal, having neither
   beginning of days, nor end of years. Omnipresent, filling all space.
   Omnipotent, having all power in Heaven and on earth. Omniscient,
   knowing all things from eternity--the great Creator, Preserver and
   Judge of all--in all things the equal and the express Image of the
   invisible God! If we err concerning the Deity of Christ, we err
   everywhere! The Gospel that

   does not reveal a Divine Savior is no Gospel at all--it is like a ship
   without a rudder--the first contrary wind that blows shall drive it to
   destruction and woe be to the souls that are trusting to it! No
   shoulders but those almighty ones which bear the earth's huge pillars
   can ever carry the enormous weight of human guilt and human need. We
   preach to you Christ, the Son of Mary, once sleeping in His mother's
   arms, yet the Infinite even while He was an Infant! Christ the reputed
   Son of Joseph, toiling in the carpenter's shop, yet being all the while
   the God who made the heavens and the earth! Christ, who had nowhere to
   lay His head, the despised and rejected of men, who is, nevertheless,
   "over all, God forever." Christ nailed to the accursed tree, bleeding
   at every pore and dying on the Cross, yet, living forevermore. Christ
   suffering agonies that are indescribable, yet being at the same time
   the God at whose right hand there are pleasures forevermore. If Christ
   had not been Man, He could not have sympathized with you and me, nor
   could He have suffered in our place. How could He have been the
   Covenant Head of the sons and daughters of Adam if He had not been made
   in all points like them, except that He was without sin? With that one
   exception, He was just as we are--bone of our bone, and flesh of our
   flesh--yet He was as truly God as He was Man, the One of whom Isaiah
   was Inspired to prophesy, "His name shall be called Wonderful,
   Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of
   Peace." So, in preaching Christ crucified, we preach the Glory of
   Heaven conjoined with the beauty of earth--the perfection of humanity
   united with the Glory and dignity of Deity!

   Then, next, we must very clearly preach Christ as the Messiah, the Sent
   One of God. It had long been foretold that a great Deliverer would come
   who would be "a light to lighten the Gentiles," and to be the Glory of
   His people, Israel, and Jesus of Nazareth was that promised Deliverer,
   of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets did write. He was sent of God
   to be the Savior of sinners. He took not this office upon Himself
   without authority, but He could truly say, "Lo, I come: in the volume
   of the Book it is written of Me, I delight to do Your will, O My God."
   He became the Substitute for sinners, but this did not happen
   accidentally, but by Divine Decree, for we read, "the Lord has laid
   upon Him the iniquity of us all." A priest unordained, a prophet unsent
   of God, a king without Divine authority would have been only a
   mockery--but our great High Priest was Divinely anointed, our peerless
   Prophet was sent of God and our king is King of kings and Lord of
   lords, rightly ruling as the Eternal Son of the Eternal Father! Sinner,
   this Truth of God should bring you hope and comfort--the Christ whom we
   preach is the Lord's Anointed! And what He does, He does by God's
   appointment. When He says to you, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and
   are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," He speaks for His Father as
   well as for Himself, for He has the warrant of the Eternal to support
   His declaration! Therefore, come confidently to Him and put your trust
   in Him!

   When the preacher has laid a good solid foundation by preaching the
   Person of Christ and the Messiahship of Christ, he must go on to preach
   the work of Christ. I can only give a brief summary of what would take
   all eternity to expound. We must so preach as to show how, in the
   Everlasting Covenant, Christ stood as the Surety and Representative of
   His people and how, in the fullness of time, He came forth from the
   ivory palaces dressed in the garments of flesh--and how He first worked
   out an active righteousness by the perfect obedience of His daily
   life--and at the last worked out a passive righteousness by His
   sufferings and death upon the Cross. Beginning at the Incarnation,
   going on to the great work of Redemption, telling of Christ's burial,
   Resurrection, Ascension, intercession before His Father's Throne and
   glorious Second Coming, we have a theme that angels might well covet--a
   theme that may well awaken hope in the sinner's heart!

   But it is especially Christ crucified whom we are to preach. His wounds
   and bruises remind us that we must tell you that "He was wounded for
   our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement
   of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed." It is
   at Calvary that salvation is to be found! Where Jesus bowed His head
   and gave up the ghost, He overcame the powers of darkness and opened
   the Kingdom of Heaven to all Believers! There is one word that every
   true servant of Christ must be able to speak very distinctly--that word
   is Substitution. I believe that Substitution is the keyword to all true
   theology--Christ standing in the place of sinners and numbered with the
   transgressors because of their transgressions, not His own--Christ
   paying our debts and discharging all our liabilities. This Truth of God
   involves, of course, our taking Christ's place as He took ours, so that
   all Believers are beloved, accepted, made heirs of God and, in due
   time, shall be glorified with Christ forever! Brother ministers,
   whatever you fail to preach, make your hearers always clearly
   understand that there is a Divine and all-sufficient Substitute for
   sinners--and that all who put their trust in Him shall be eternally
   saved!

   When we have preached Christ thus, we must also preach His offices. We
   must preach Him as the one great High Priest who always lives to make
   intercession for us. We must preach Him as the Prophet whose words are
   Divine and, therefore, come to us with an authority that cannot be set
   aside. And we must mind that we always preach Him as King, putting the
   crown of praise upon His royal head and claiming from His people the
   unfaltering allegiance and loyalty of their hearts--and the undivided
   service of their lives!

   We must also preach the qualifications of Christ for His offices. Is He
   a Husband? We must tell how loving and how tender He is. Is He a
   Shepherd? We must proclaim His patience, His power, His
   perseverance--and we must especially tell of His self-sacrificing love
   in laying down His life for His sheep. Is He a Savior? We must show how
   He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him. We
   must talk much of the gentleness that will not break the bruised reed,
   nor quench the smoking flax. We must delight to speak of Christ as
   bending over the broken in heart, binding up their wounds and having
   His ears always open to hear the cry of a contrite spirit! It is the
   Character of Christ that is the magnet that attracts sinners to
   Himself--and upon this blessed theme one might go on speaking forever!
   When Rutherford was talking of the beauties of the Christ whom he loved
   so dearly, one of his hearers was compelled to cry out, "Now, mon, you
   are on the right string, keep to that!" And, indeed, this is a theme
   that might stir the stammerer to speak with power and make the very
   dumb to be eloquent for Christ! Oh, how glorious is our blessed Lord!
   With the spouse we may well say, "Yes, He is altogether lovely." We
   cannot exaggerate His excellence and charms and it must be our constant
   aim to paint such a portrait of Him that sinners may fall in love with
   Him and trust Him to save them with His great salvation!

   We must mind that we always preach Christ as the sinner's only hope. In
   the olden times, there were certain simpletons who sought after a
   universal remedy for all diseases--a catholicon. But their search was
   in vain. All the advertisements of quack medicines that ever deceived
   silly people will never convince sensible folk that such a catholicon
   for all the diseases to which flesh is heir has ever been or will ever
   be discovered. Yet there is a catholicon for the diseases of the soul,
   and that catholicon is Christ! Be your disease what it may--the raging
   fever of lust, the shivering fits of doubts and fears, or the fell
   consumption of despair--Jesus Christ can heal you! Whatever form sin
   may take--whether it is the blind eye, or the deaf ear, or the hard,
   stony heart, or the dull, seared conscience--there is a medicine in the
   veins of Jesus that we may well call the Divine Heal-All! No case that
   was ever submitted to Christ has baffled His skill and He is still
   "mighty to save." We must be very clear in telling the sinner that
   there is no hope for him anywhere else but in Christ. Nine out of ten
   of the arrows in a minister's quiver ought to be shot at the sinner's
   good works, for these are his worst enemies. That "deadly doing" that
   needs to be cast "down at Jesus' feet"--that trying to be or to
   feelsomethingin order that they may save themselves--this is the curse
   of many! O Sinner, if from the crown of your head to the soles of your
   feet, there is no sound part in you, but you are full of wounds,
   bruises and putrefying sores, yet, if you will but believe in Jesus, He
   will make you whole every whit, and you shall go your way a sinner
   saved by Grace!

   We must also preach Christ as the Christian's only joy. We needed
   Christ as a life buoy when we were sinking in the waves of sin, but we
   need Him to be our meat and our drink, now that He has brought us
   safely to land. When we were sick through sin, we needed Christ as
   medicine, but now that He has restored our soul, we need Him as our
   continual nourishment. There is no lack which a Christian ever has
   which Christ cannot fully supply and there is nothing in Christ which
   is not useful to a Christian. You know that some things that we have
   are good, but they are not altogether of service to us. For instance,
   fruit is good, but there is the skin to be pared off and the seed to be
   thrown away. But when Christ gives Himself to us, we may take the whole
   of Him and enjoy Him to our heart's content! Everything Christ is and
   everything Christ has, is ours. Therefore, Christian, make a covenant
   with your hands that you will lay hold on Christ's Cross for your only
   confidence! Make a covenant with your eyes that you will look nowhere
   for light but to the Sun of Righteousness! Make a covenant with your
   whole being that it shall be crucified with Christ and then be taken up
   to Heaven to live and reign with Him forever! Yes, let this be the
   utterance of your heart--

   "You, O Christ, are all I need, More than all in You I find."

   II. Now, secondly, TO WHOM ARE WE TO PREACH THIS?

   Possibly, one Brother says, "You ought to preach Christ to the elect"
   But how are we to know who are the elect? I read a sermon, some time
   ago, in which the minister said, "I have been preaching to the living
   in Zion--the rest of you

   are dead and I have nothing to say to you. The election has obtained it
   and the rest are blinded." Preachers of that sort have life to preach
   to the living, medicine to prescribe for those who are whole, but what
   is the good of that? Fancy Peter standing up with the 11 on the day of
   Pentecost and saying to the crowd gathered around them, "I do not know
   how many of you who are here are elect, but I have to say to you that
   the election has obtained it and the rest are blinded." How many would
   have been converted and added to the Church through such a message as
   that? Now Peter was, at that time, filled with the Spirit--and it was
   by Divine Inspiration that he preached Christ crucified to the whole of
   that mixed multitude and then, when they were pricked in their heart
   and cried out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" He was equally
   Inspired when he answered, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you,
   in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall
   receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."

   I mean to do as Peter did, for I regard Christ's commission to His
   disciples as binding upon us today--"Go you into all the world, and
   preach the Gospel to every creature." I cannot tell whether every
   creature to whom I preach is elect or not, but it is my business to
   preach the Gospel to all whom I can reach, resting assured that all of
   them whom God has chosen unto eternal life will certainly accept it!
   When a certain clergyman asked the Duke of Wellington, "Does Your Grace
   think it is any use preaching the Gospel to the Hindus?" he simply
   replied, "What are your marching orders?" As a soldier, he believed in
   obeying orders. And when the clergyman answered that the orders were,
   "Preach the Gospel to every creature," the Duke said, "Then your duty
   is quite clear. Obey your Master's orders and don't you trouble, about
   anybody else's opinions."

   The main business of a true minister is to preach the Gospel to sinners
   and he is never so happy as when he is preaching to those who know
   themselves to be sinners! When he is preaching to those who are
   self-righteous, he is in great trouble about the effect of his message,
   for he fears that it may prove to be a savor of death unto death to
   them. But when he meets with those who sorrowfully confess that they
   are guilty, lost and undone, then he rejoices in hope of blessed
   results from his preaching. He feels that he is now among fish that
   will soon take the bait, so he drops his line into the river and soon
   has the joy of bringing many to land! He knows that bread is always
   sweetest to hungry men and that even bitter medicine will be eagerly
   swallowed by the man who its very ill and who longs to be cured. He
   understands that it is the naked that need to be clothed and the
   penniless who clamor for alms. O Sinners, if you realize that you are
   foul and vile, full of all manner of evil, with nothing of your own
   that is worthy to be called good--and if you are longing to be
   delivered from evil of every sort and to be made holy as God is holy, I
   am glad that my Master has given me in His Word such a message as this
   for you--"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us
   our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

   Still, a true minister of Christ will not confine his preaching to
   sinners who are sensible of their guilt, but he will preach the Gospel
   to sinners of all ages. To the young, whose lives have not yet been
   defiled by the vices of age, he preaches Christ crucified as the
   children's Savior and he is glad, indeed, when the boys and the girls
   trust in Jesus and are saved. To you who have reached middle life, he
   preaches Christ crucified as the balm for every wound, the cordial for
   all care and thankful is he when you, also, are saved by Grace through
   faith in Jesus! To the old and gray-headed, to the decrepit, to those
   on the very verge of the tomb, he still preaches Christ crucified! If
   he could find a sinner who had reached the age of Methuselah, he would
   have the same Gospel to preach to him, for he knows that there is no
   Savior but the crucified Christ of Calvary! And he also knows that, old
   or young, or if neither old nor young--all who trust Him are
   immediately saved and saved forever!

   And as he preaches Christ to sinners of every age, he also preaches
   Christ to sinners of every rank. He has nothing better than Christ to
   preach to queens, princes and nobles--and he has nothing less than
   Christ to preach to peasants, artisans, or paupers--Christ crucified
   for men of letters and learning and Christ crucified equally for the
   ignorant and illiterate!

   He also preaches Christ to sinners of every sort, even to the atheist,
   the man who says there is no God! He bids him believe and live. He
   preaches Christ to the openly profane. When they pause for a while in
   their swearing, he tells them of that great oath which God has sworn,
   "As I live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the
   wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live." We preach
   Christ to the harlots in the street and oh, how joyfully have many of
   them received Him and how gladly have they found cleansing from their
   foul stains in Jesus' precious blood! We preach

   Christ to the drunk, for we believe that nothing but the Grace of God
   can rescue him from his degradation and sin--and many such sinners
   haves we seen reclaimed by the Gospel!

   The preaching of Christ crucified, the lifting up of the dying Son of
   God, "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness," has power
   enough to turn the whole world upside down and to change innumerable
   sinners into saints, so we mean to keep on preaching Christ to all
   sinners of all sorts! We do not intend to leave out one, not even you,
   my Friend, who think you are left out, or ought to be left out. We know
   that there is a Book of Life before the Throne of God and that no more
   names can be written there--they were all recorded before the
   foundation of the world when the Father gave to Christ those who are to
   be eternally His. We cannot mount up to Heaven to read the names that
   are written there, but we believe the list contains millions upon
   millions of names of those who have not yet trusted in Christ, so we
   mean to keep on preaching Christ to sinners of every age, of every
   rank, of every sort, of every degree of blackness and vileness! And we
   believe that "there is yet room," there is yet mercy for the miserable,
   there is yet forgiveness for the guilty who will come and trust in
   Jesus Christ and Him crucified!

   III. Now, lastly, HOW OUGHT WE TO PREACH CHRIST CRUCIFIED?

   I think, first, we ought to preach Christ very boldly. I recollect a
   young man going into a pulpit to address a small congregation, and he
   began by saying that he hoped they would pardon his youth and forgive
   his impertinence in coming to speak to them. Some foolish old gentleman
   said, "How humble that young man is to talk like that!" But another,
   who was wiser, though he was younger, said, "What a dishonor to his
   Lord and Master! If God sent him with a message to these people, what
   does it matter whether he is young or old? Such mock modesty as that is
   out of place in the pulpit." I think that second man was right and the
   first one wrong. A true minister of the Gospel is an ambassador for
   Christ and do our ambassadors go to foreign courts with apologies for
   carrying messages from their sovereign? It would be a gross insult to
   the crown of these realms if they showed such humility as that in their
   official capacity! Let ministers of the Gospel keep their modesty for
   other occasions when it ought to be manifested, but let them not
   dishonor their Master and discredit His message as that silly young man
   did! When we preach Christ crucified, we have no reason to stammer, or
   stutter, or hesitate, or apologize--there is nothing in the Gospel of
   which we have any cause to be ashamed! If a minister is not sure about
   his message, let him keep quiet till he is sure about it! We believe
   and, therefore, we speak with the accent of conviction! If I have not
   proved the power of the Gospel in my own heart and life, I am a base
   impostor to be standing in this pulpit to preach that Gospel to others!
   But as I do most assuredly know that I am saved by Grace through faith
   in Jesus Christ, and as I feel certain that I have been Divinely called
   to preach His Gospel--

   "Shall I for fear of feeble man, The Spirit's course in me restrain? Or
   undismayed in deed and word, Be a true witness for my Lord?"

   But while we preach Christ boldly, we must also preach Him
   affectionately. There must be great love in our proclamation of the
   Truth of God. We must not hesitate to point out to sinners the state of
   ruin to which sin has brought them. And we must clearly set before them
   the Divinely-appointed remedy. But we must mingle a mother's tenderness
   with a father's sternness. Paul was like both mother and father, in a
   spiritual sense, in his ministry. He wrote to the Galatians, "My little
   children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in
   you." And to the Corinthians he wrote, "In Christ Jesus I have begotten
   you through the Gospel." And every true minister of Christ can, in his
   measure, sympathize with him in both those experiences. Yes, Sinners,
   we do, indeed, love you! Often our heart is well-near broken with the
   longing we have to see you saved! We wish we could preach to you with
   Baxter's tearful eyes--no, rather with the Savior's melting heart and
   all-consuming zeal!

   Then, next, we must preach Christ only. With Paul, every true minister
   ought to be able to say to his hearers, "I determined not to know
   anything among you save Jesus Christ and Him crucified." The preacher
   must never mix up anything else with the Gospel. Every time he
   preaches, he must still have the same old theme, "Jesus Christ and Him
   crucified." Christ is the Alpha of the Gospel and He is the Omega, too!
   The first letter of the Gospel alphabet and the last let-ter--and all
   the letters in between! It must be Christ, Christ, CHRIST from
   beginning to end! There must be no work-mongering or anything else
   mixed up with Christ! There must be no daubing with untempered mortar
   in our building upon Christ, the one Foundation that is laid once for
   all!

   The preacher must also mind that he preaches Christ very simply. He
   must break up his big words and long sentences and pray against the
   temptation to use them. It is usually the short, dagger-like sentence
   that does the work best. A true servant of Christ must never try to let
   the people see how well he can preach. He must never go out of his way
   to drag a pretty piece of poetry in his sermon, nor to introduce some
   fine quotations from the classics. He must employ a simple, homely
   style, or such a style as God has given him. And he must preach Christ
   so plainly that his hearers can not only understand him, but that they
   cannot misunderstandhim even if they try to do so!

   Now as the time has gone, I must close by saying that we must try to
   preach Christ savingly. O Sinners, I would that you would trust Christ
   this very moment! Do you realize how great your danger is? Unconverted
   Soul, you are standing, as it were, over the mouth of Hell on a single
   plank--and that plank is rotten! Man, you may be in your grave before
   another Sabbath dawns and then, if unsaved, you will be in Hell! Beware
   lest you are taken away unprepared, for if that is your unhappy lot,
   there will be no ransom that can deliver your lost soul from going down
   to the Pit! See your need of Christ, Sinner, and lay hold of Him by
   faith! None but Christ can save you! Christ is the Way! You may go
   about all your days trying to find another entrance to Heaven, but you
   will not find it for this is the only one. Why will you not come to God
   by Christ? Why are you so ungrateful as to despise the long-suffering
   mercy of God? Will not the goodness of God lead you to repentance?
   Shall Christ die for sinners and yet will you, O Sinner, turn away from
   Him who alone can give you life? If you will but trust Him, He will
   save you! Your sins, which are many, shall all be forgiven you! You
   shall be adopted into the family of God and in due time you shall find
   yourself in Heaven to go no more out forever! If you would be happy. If
   you would enjoy the peace that passes all understanding. If you would
   have two heavens--a Heaven below and a Heaven above--trust in Jesus,
   Sinner, trust in Jesus this very moment! Go not out of this building
   unsaved. One believing look will bring you salvation, for--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for thee. Then look, Sinner--look unto Him and be saved-- Unto
   Him who was nailed to the tree." Look unto Him, look unto Him now! May
   the Holy Spirit enable you to look and live, for Jesus Christ's sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 CORINTHIANS 1.

   Verses 1, 2. Paul, called to be an Apostle of Jesus Christ through the
   will of God, andSosthenes our brother, unto the Church of God which is
   at Corinth. Note the humility of Paul in associating with himself an
   almost unknown Brother, Sosthenes. Although the letter is written by
   Paul, yet, as if he did not care to stand in isolation even for a
   moment, he associates Sosthenes with himself in the salutation--"Unto
   the Church of God which is at Corinth."

   2. To them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints.
   Called to sacred uses, set apart unto God. That is the call of all
   Believers--they are like those vessels of the sanctuary which were not
   to be used by any but the priests of God, and by them only for God's
   service.

   2. With all who in everyplace call upon the name of Jesus Christ our
   Lord, both theirs and ours. That is a very happy phrase, "both theirs
   and ours." There are multitudes of saints whose faces we never saw, yet
   Christ is theirs. There are some with whom we might not agree in all
   particulars, yet Christ is theirs just as much as He is ours. All
   Christ is theirs, and all Christ is ours, and here is the grand bond of
   union between Believers of different nationalities and different
   tongues.

   3. Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father and from the Lord
   Jesus Christ Grace first, for that is the fountain. Then peace comes,
   for that is the fitting stream to flow from the Fountain of Grace. Seek
   not peace first, for there is no peace for unregenerate man! Grace
   first, then peace, and "both must come from God our Father and from the
   Lord Jesus Christ."

   4. I thank my God always on your behalf for the Grace of God which is
   given you by Jesus Christ That is wisely written, for Paul was about to
   upbraid these Corinthians for many serious faults, yet he begins by
   acknowledging that they had certain excellences. It gives you a ground
   to stand upon if you are willing to see all that is good in those whom
   you have to rebuke. But Paul did not merely use this as a polite way of
   commencing his Epistle. He really did, every day,

   thank God for the Divine Grace which these Corinthians had! Yet how
   seldom do we thank God for the Grace that He has given to other people,
   especially if they outshine us, if they do more for the cause of God
   than we do--then we half regret that they have so much Grace! But it
   was not so with Paul.

   5, 6. That in everything you are enriched by Him, in all utterance, and
   in all knowledge; even as the testimony of

   Christ was confirmed in you [See Sermon #2875, Volume 50--CONFIRMING
   THE WITNESS OF CHRIST.] The Church at Corinth was an important Church,
   with more than the usual number of speaking men among the members. This
   led to mischief, but had they known how to use this talent aright, the
   Church at Corinth might have been of great service! Instead, it split
   itself up into little parties and became one of the worst churches that
   then existed, as certain communities which imitate them in this present
   day, have also done.

   7, 8. So that you come behind in no gift: waiting for the coming of our
   Lord Jesus Christ: who shall also confirm you unto the end, that we may
   be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ Paul continues to
   recognize the abundance of their endowments and to express for them the
   utmost of affection. And then he adds his full conviction that God
   would prove the power of His Grace by keeping them unto the end, and
   then presenting them "blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   9. God is faithful, by whom you were called unto the fellowship of His
   Son Jesus Christ our Lord [See Sermon #2580, Volume 44--PARTNERSHIP
   WITH CHRIST.] As Paul wrote to the Thessalo-

   nians, "Faithful is He that calls you, who also will do it." To be
   called by the faithful God is the guarantee of everlasting salvation!

   10. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name ofour Lord Jesus Christ,
   thatyou allspeak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among
   you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same kind and in
   the same judgment They could not speak the same thing if they had not
   the same mind and the same judgment. Paul dreaded the introduction of
   anything that would divide the hearts of Believers, one from another,
   and, Beloved, let every one of us, wherever we go, be on the side of
   Christian truth, Christian unity and Christian love. There is no true
   unity outside of Truth of God and the nearest way to Christian union is
   union in the Truth of God! When error shall be destroyed, that which
   divides will be taken away. When Truth is dominant, union will be
   universal, but it will not be so before that is the case.

   11. For it has been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by they which
   are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.He does
   not go beating about the bush, but he speaks straight out and gives the
   name of his informants, for persons who bring reports about others
   should always be ready to have their names mentioned. It may be
   unpleasant for them, but it is sometimes necessary to do unpleasant
   things and those who will not allow their names to be mentioned in
   connection with a statement adverse to character, deserve no notice
   whatever.

   12. Now this Isay, that every one ofyou says, I am ofPaul; andIof
   Apollos; andIof Cephas; andIof Christ. The last were as bad as the
   others--it makes no difference what the party name is--for it may only
   thinly conceal the most sectarian spirit to say, "I am of Christ."

   13. Is Christ divided?Paul begins with that, for it is the worst of all
   divisions to make Christ the head of a party in His own Church!

   13-16. Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name
   ofPaul? I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius,
   lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name. AndI baptized
   also the household of Stephanas: besides I know not whether I baptized
   any othei. Paul considered that it was a Providential circumstance that
   He had baptized no more of them, else they would have cried themselves
   up as superior to those who had been baptized by others.

   17. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel: not
   with wisdom of words, lest the Cross of Christ should be made of no
   effect.It is true that Baptism is in the original commission of all
   Christ's servants, but it occupies a very secondary place compared with
   the preaching of the Gospel! It was an evil day when the Christian
   Church began to put rites before doctrines, and ceremonies in the place
   that should be occupied by the Gospel, itself! Paul therefore says that
   his main commission was "not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel."

   18-20 For the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish
   foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. For it
   is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to
   nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is
   the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Has not God made
   foolish the wisdom of this world?Indeed He has! He has let it run the
   full length of its tether so that we may see the folly that can be
   taught by wise men!

   21. For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not
   God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
   believe. Not by foolish preaching, but by that preaching which men call
   foolishness.

   22. For the Jews require a sign. They were always looking for
   supernatural manifestations.

   22. And the Greeks seek after wisdom. They would believe nothing but
   what could be proved to them by logic.

   23-25. But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block,
   and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both
   Jews and Greeks, Christis thepower ofGod, and the wisdom ofGod. Because
   the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is
   stronger than men They call it foolishness, but it is wiser than men's
   wisdom! God at His lowest (if we can imagine such a thing) is wiser
   than man at his highest "and the weakness of God (if such a thing could
   be) is stronger than men."

   26-28. For you see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
   after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called: but God
   has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and
   God has chosen the weak things of this world to confound the things
   which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are
   despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to
   nothing things that are. [See Sermon #587, Volume io--god's

   STRANGE CHOICE.] Those that do not even seem to have an
   existence--those that are so despicable that men do not deign to take
   any account of them--these are the very ones with which God shall break
   in pieces the many mighty errors of all the ages!

   29-31 That no flesh should glory in His Presence. But of Him are you in
   Christ Jesus, who ofGod is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
   sanctifcation, and redemption: that, according as it is written, He
   that gloried, let him glory in the Lord.

"He Blessed Him There"

   (No. 3219)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He blessed him there." Genesis 32:29.

   JACOB had said to the Angel, "Tell me, I pray You, Your name." In
   answer to that enquiry, he was gently rebuked. The Angel did not come
   to ratify Jacob's curiosity, but He came as a messenger from God with a
   blessing--"and He blessed him there." There are a great many things we
   would like to know when we read the Bible. But if we read it so as to
   find salvation, that will be much better than having our curiosity
   gratified. When we come to hear a sermon, too, we should like, perhaps,
   to meet with some fine passages, or to have some telling anecdotes that
   we could carry away with us. But if, instead, the Lord's messenger
   shall give us a blessing from God, Himself, it will be infinitely
   better! The disciples, after the Resurrection, wanted to know from the
   Savior something about the times and seasons, but He did not tell it to
   them. He said to them, "You shall receive power after that the Holy
   Spirit is come upon you." That was far better, far more valuable to
   them--and though for the time it might not please them so much, yet,
   for all practical purposes, it enriched them far more! Angels' names we
   can afford to leave, but God's blessing we must have and we cannot do
   without it!

   I. Let us just think, for a minute or two, WHAT THIS BLESSING WAS WHICH
   JACOB GAINED AS THE RESULT OF A NIGHT OF PRAYER.

   I wonder whether anybody here has ever spent a night in prayer. Is
   there a man among us who has ever wrestled with the Angel for so long?
   Alas, I am afraid to put the question and ask for an answer lest I
   should only gain one through your silence! Brothers and Sisters, it is
   not easy to continue for a whole night in prayer. It has been well
   observed that it is easier to hear a sermon two hours long than to pray
   for an hour. The more spiritual the exercise, the sooner we tire.
   Joshua was not weary of fighting in the valley, but Moses' hands began
   to grow weary with holding them up in prayer. Yet surely there have
   been times in our lives, as in that of Jacob's, when a night of prayer
   would have been becoming. Surely we have been in as great straits and
   struggles as he was and have needed the benediction of Heaven as did
   that much-tried Patriarch. Perhaps it would be well, before long, to
   try to accomplish this feat and wait, from sunset to sunrise with God.
   The old knights, before they took a higher degree of knighthood, spent
   a night in some church and were supposed to be in prayer. He that shall
   really spend a night in prayer shall win celestial blessings. He shall
   lie down a Jacob, but he shall rise up a prince! There is a distinct
   advance from Jacob to Israel, from being a supplanter to being a
   prince! Prayer gives an incalculable blessing and this is the advance
   Jacob gained--an incomparable advance in spiritual things.

   But besides that, he gained as the blessing attending that night's
   prayer, deliverance out of great peril He thought that he and his would
   have been slain by Esau, but the Angel blessed him and not a single
   lamb of all his flock was hurt, neither were the women and children put
   to the slightest fear! Prayer brought down Heaven's shield to cover
   Jacob in the hour of danger!

   Again, he got what was still better under some aspects, reconciliation
   with his brother. He had done his brother grievous wrong, but his
   brother forgave him. I do not know, but I think a Christian would
   almost sooner be exposed to peril than live under a sense of having
   committed an injustice. It is a great relief to your mind, when you
   have done so, to find it all set right again. To think, "I did that man
   a wrong, but it is gone and forgiven forever," is a blessing worth
   praying all night to obtain!

   Happy was Jacob, also, to have the breach healed between himself and
   his brother.To meet him, fall upon his neck and kiss him--to feel that
   being so near akin they should no longer be divided in heart. Are you
   divided from your brother? Has any root of bitterness sprung up to
   trouble you? Have the friendships of life been curdled by dislike? It
   were well to have a night of prayer to get them back again--and again
   to serve side by side with your fellows. I take it to be a vast
   blessing to a Christian to be delivered from the temptation to
   retaliate, to be saved from all hardness of heart and bitterness of
   spirit. The Angel, when He gave Jacob that, blessed him, indeed!

   Besides all these blessings--in addition to having risen in rank before
   God, to having had his wrong amended, to having been forgiven by his
   brother, to being restored to friendship--I do not doubt that from that
   night a blessing rested upon Jacob's heart and the dews of that night
   fed his soul for years to come! He was anointed with fresh oil from
   that moment! And as he rose, limping upon his thigh, he was not merely
   a better man by title, but better by nature! He had been away in a
   far-off country with Laban and much of the dew of his spirit had gone
   from him. But now that he had got back again into Canaan, the Angel
   sealed his return by giving him the blessings of the return!

   Such were the blessings of Jacob and I should not wonder if there is
   someone here who has said, "I know in a measure, personally, what those
   blessings are and wish I enjoyed them to the fullest." My prayer,
   Beloved Brothers and Sisters, is that even tonight God may bless you!
   According to your necessity, may He shape the blessing, but oh, may He
   bless you, indeed, and bless you here!

   II. Now, secondly, let us enquire, WHAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE JACOB GOT
   THIS CHOICE BLESSING?

   And the answer comes, first, it was a place of very peculiar trial. He
   had just got out of Laban's clutches to fall in the way of Esau. He had
   fled from a lion and now a bear met him--and he feared that his wives
   and children would be utterly destroyed by his revengeful brother. It
   was a fearful trial and the mere fear of it must have left scars on his
   heart. Yet, "He blessed him there." Is not this a very usual
   circumstance with the people of God, that their severest trials are the
   times of their choicest mercies? I remind you how often this has been
   the case, and how true Cowper's words have been--

   "The clouds you so much dread Are big with mercy and shall break In
   blessings on your head."

   Believe that, for the present trial in which you are, perhaps, now
   entering, it shall be written, "He blessed him there where He tried
   him." He will bless you there, where He is trying you--in the waters,
   in the furnace when you are being refined again and again, and the hot
   coals are being heaped upon you--He will bless you there! The disciples
   feared, we are told, as they entered into the cloud, but it was there
   that they saw the Savior transfigured. And often we fear the cloud into
   which we enter when we are only passing into the secret place of the
   Most High, where, under the shadow of the Almighty, we shall have yet
   more delightful visions of Himself!

   If we were wise, we would begin to welcome trials. We would rather fear
   to be without them for, up till now, what do we not owe to the furnace,
   to the rod, to the threshing-flail? Scarcely has a mercy of any great
   spiritual value come to us at all except by the way of the cross! I am
   sure I may look upon every choice blessing I have enjoyed as having
   come to me in rumbling wagons like the good things which came from
   Egypt to old father Jacob. We have been blessed in places of trial--let
   us not, therefore, dread to go to such places again, but go on our way
   towards Heaven feeling that whatever difficulty we meet with shall only
   be another of the spots in which God shall bless us. "He blessed him
   there."

   It was also a place of pleading. That is most noteworthy. "He blessed
   him there," where he had spent a night in prayer. Where he had a
   wrestling match with an unknown Stranger. There where he would not let
   the Angel go. There where he held Him fast until he gained the
   benediction. "He blessed him there." If you are short of blessings,
   resort to the place of mighty prayer--

   "Beyond your utmost needs His love and power can bless! To praying
   souls He always grants More than they can express."

   All things are open to the man who knows how to pray importunately.
   "The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by
   force." Mark you, Jacob's wrestling was no child's play. I have seen
   painters attempt to depict it and only now and then have they caught
   the true idea. But one of them represents Jacob as trying most lustily
   to give his an-

   tagonist a back fall and, no doubt, he did tax his strength to the
   utmost until, in the dead of night, he was faint--faint with the toil
   he had gone through.

   Begging of God must be real work. It is said of begging that it is the
   worst trade in the world, but a man who is to make anything of prayer
   must throw his whole soul into it. Your prayers that have hardly life
   enough in them to live, your words that hang like icicles beneath your
   tongues, that are scarcely heard even by yourselves, how do you think
   that they will be heard by God? If there is not enough prayer in us to
   stir our own hearts, how can we expect that God should be moved by our
   entreaties? It was not so with Jacob--"He blessed him there." There he
   prevailed, and if you want a blessing, you must get it in that way.
   When you get to the state that you will take no denial--that you would
   sooner die than not be blessed--you shall get it.

   Again, in addition to its being a place of trial and a place of
   pleading, it was a place of communion. Do you recognize it? Jacob
   called it, "Peniel"--that is, "the face of God"--because there he had
   seen God face to face. O Beloved, these are things to feel rather than
   to speak about! To see God! Blessed, indeed, are "the pure in heart"
   when they get this benediction fulfilled in their experience and come
   so into union with Christ as to be able to look to God with an eye that
   is not blinded with fear! Oh to speak with God, pouring out our hearts
   before Him and to hear Him speaking with us, the promise no longer
   lying like a dead letter on the page, but leaping out of the page as
   though alive, as though God had just spoken it and we were hearing it
   from His Divine mouth! Do you know what this blessing means? Can you
   read Solomon's Song through and stay, "I understand it"? Is it your
   experience that you have ever fed on the body and blood of Christ,
   having His very life in you? If you have, then you have seen God and it
   will be said of you, "He blessed him there." Brothers and Sisters, we
   miss a thousand blessings because we are too busy to commune with God!
   We are here, there, and everywhere, except where we ought to be. We are
   running to this and to that instead of sitting with Mary at the
   Master's feet. He blessed Mary as she sat there, and there, too, will
   He be sure to bless us--

   "Oh that I could forever sit

   With Mary at the Master's feet!

   Be this my happy choice--

   My only care, delight and bliss,

   My joy, my Heaven on earth, be this--

   To hear the Bridegroom's voice!" But once more. Where Jacob got the
   blessing, it was a place of conscious weakness. The Angel touched the
   sinew in the hollow of his thigh. While he got the blessing, he got
   lameness, too, and he might be well content to carry that lameness to
   his grave! I have often found that the place where I have seen most of
   my own insignificance, baseness, unbelief and depravity has been the
   place where I have found a great blessing. Did you ever try to preach
   and fail in the doing of it-- and then found that God blessed you
   there? Have you ever tried to be earnest with the Sunday school
   children and were earnest, too, but in your own judgment you made a
   fool of yourself? Have you not found that God blessed you there? Is it
   not one of the greatest blessings that can occur to us to be made to
   think little of ourselves? May not God be enriching us most when He is
   emptying us and preparing us for the largest possible benediction when
   He is making us to see how destitute in all things we are?

   The most unpleasant places to us in life are often the places where the
   blessing comes most. "He blessed him there." He took the rich man from
   his palace and made him live in a cottage, but, "He blessed him there."
   He took the strong man from his vigor and laid him on a sick bed. But,
   "He blessed him there." He brought down the man of full assurance into
   a state of trembling and anxiety, but, "He blessed him there." He
   brought the man of busy usefulness down to be a patient sufferer,
   unable to stir hand or foot for the Lord he loved so well, but, "He
   blessed him there." He took the man of good repute and allowed his
   character to be evilly spoken of--and his good name to be
   withered--but, "He blessed him there." It is often so. We limp with
   lameness, with shrinking of the sinew, the precious thing wherein our
   strength seemed to lie! But that may be the very way to a benediction
   which otherwise we would never have received.

   I would then encourage each one of you to seek a blessing, wherever you
   may be. I think most of you have been in the house of trial--seek to
   get a blessing there. The place of pleading, at any rate, is open to
   you all--get a blessing there. The sacred spot of communion--we may get
   the blessing that is always to be found there. And I suppose most of
   you have had your times of tumbling, of stripping and getting very
   low--may you get a blessing there!

   III. So I turn to notice very briefly that THERE ARE OTHER PLACES WHERE
   CHRISTIANS GET BLESSINGS besides the place where Jacob won his.

   Beloved, there is a place (how shall I speak of it?) where the Lord has
   always blessed us. It is of old in eternity. God is so glad to bless
   His people that He began doing it long ago! "Long ago," do I say? He
   began before time began! He has blessed us with all spiritual blessings
   in Christ Jesus according as He has chosen us in Him before the
   foundation of the world. When the Decree was given, when the Covenant
   was established, when the Election was determined, He blessed each one
   of us there, if indeed we are Believers in Jesus--

   "Sons we are through God's election,

   Who in Jesus Christ believe

   By eternal destination,

   Sovereign Grace we here receive!

   Lord, Your mercy

   Does both Grace and glory give."

   I might point to a thousand spots all down the line of history and say
   that all of us who are in Christ were blessed there! But I will only
   linger at the Cross and say, "Where Jehovah was made a curse for us and
   suffered in our place, He blessed us there! And at that open, empty
   tomb, from which escaped the living Savior whom the bands of death
   could not hold, He blessed us there! He who died for our transgression,
   rose again for our justification and by His Resurrection-- He blessed
   us there! And when He stood on Olivet about to depart and pronounced
   the blessing upon His disciples, He blessed us there! And as He
   ascended up on high, leading captivity captive--from His royal chariot
   He cast down lavishly with, both His hands ten thousand gifts for the
   sons of men which He had received even for the rebellious, that the
   Lord God might dwell among them--He blessed us there! And up in Heaven
   where He sits till His work is done, He points to His wounds, and
   points to our names, and reminds the Father of His eternal love to us!
   He has blessed us there, for He has raised us up and "made us sit
   together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

   But as there are places in your own experience, Beloved, where He has
   blessed you, I would take some of you back in your history to the
   moment when you first knew the Lord. I often try to refresh your
   memories about that--and I do not think I can do it too often. Where
   was the spot when, laden with woes and sins, you saw Jesus Christ and
   looked to Him and at once were lightened? Where was it? When was it?
   Twenty years ago, perhaps. With some of us, more than that! With
   others, only two or three years ago. With others of you, perhaps, it is
   only a week ago! Well, whenever it was, when He led you to see the
   Savior, He blessed you, there, as you never had been experimentally
   blessed before! I should not wonder if the day is marked down in your
   diary, though there is little need it should be, for it is marked on
   the tablets of your memory and you will never forget it. O blessed
   spot! O happy moment when Jesus first met with me! He blessed me there!
   Well, since that time, have there not been other places where He has
   blessed you?

   I might mention every trial you have had and say, "He blessed you
   there." I might mention every benefit you have received and say, "He
   blessed you there." But time would fail me. Only I will remind you that
   when you have been prompt to obey your Lord and keep close to Him--and
   have not allowed any cloud to come between you and Him, He has blessed
   you there! If you have kept up that spirit of obedience, take care to
   let your eyes be to Him as the eyes of a handmaiden are to her
   mistress, for He will bless you there! And have you not found that when
   you have been most empty and had least self-reliance, He has blessed
   you there? When you have been very weak and little in your own esteem,
   and felt that you were nothing, and less than nothing, and ready to
   die--has He not blessed you there? When you have been kept low, without
   an ambitious thought, down on the very ground before Him and have been
   afraid to look up from a sense of unworthiness, has He not blessed you
   there? Oh, then, keep to the low places! There is no place so safe as
   the Valley of Humiliation--

   "He that is down need fear no fall, He that is low, no pride."

   He has blessed you there! It would be difficult for me to say where God
   has notblessed me. Wherever He has led me, wherever He has directed me,
   seeking His blessing I have found it and, therefore, will I bear my
   witness to His faithfulness.

   Well, by-and-by, when your time will come to die, He will bless you
   there. Before that time, you may be a sufferer, but He will bless you
   there. You may lose the dear husband who now is your strength, or the
   beloved wife who now is your comfort, but He will bless you there! You
   may have to go to the grave with one child after another--and you your-

   self may be very weak and scarcely have life left within you, but He
   will bless you there! What He has been He will be. If God could change,
   we might doubt, but since He never changes and is without shadow of
   turning, let us look back through the many days since we first met Him
   and He met us. Remember that we have been held up till now and that He
   has helped us in every time of need! And then ask--

   "After so much mercy past,

   Will He let us sink at last?"

   What I am saying is very commonplace and might suggest itself to
   anybody here. But, at the same time, when you get into trouble, it does
   not always suggest itself and you have need to be reminded of these
   simple principles. He blessed you there, and in such places He will
   bless you again!

   One more word about that, and it is this. Has not He often blessed you
   in the House of Prayer Has He not blessed you in listening to the
   Gospel? I know He has. Never, therefore, neglect the House of God. Has
   He not blessed you at the Prayer Meeting? Cannot you say, "He blessed
   me there"? Well, then, let us see your face there as often as possible!
   Has He not blessed you at the Communion Table? Oh, if there is under
   Heaven an ordinance that is Christ's mirror. If there is under Heaven a
   hand that can withdraw the blind and pull up the lattices and let us
   see the King in His beauty, it is the Lord's Supper! He has often
   blessed us there! Let those who despise the Table of the Lord stay
   away--but those who have got the blessing will wish to be there often
   and come again and again, saying, "Sirs, we would see Jesus."

   IV. We have seen what Jacob's blessing was and where God blessed Jacob.
   We remember where He has blessed us and now, in the last place, let me
   ask, IS NOT THIS ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE WE MAY EXPECT HIM TO BLESS

   US?

   Is there a man here who, never, to his own knowledge, had a blessing
   from God and who is saying, "I wish God would bless me, even me"? Are
   you willing, if God helps you, to give up all your sins? Would you wish
   to be clear of them? Well, Soul, if you desire that, God will bless you
   right now! For, if you would be rid of sin, God also wishes you to be
   rid of it--and so you and He are agreed. He will be sure to blot your
   sins out and tread them under His feet through His dear Son, Jesus
   Christ. Do you say that you need a blessing? I will put another
   question to you. Are you willing to have Jesus Christ be your Savior,
   not in part, but altogether? Will you let Christ be the first and the
   last? Will you take Him not to be a makeweight, but a Savior who can
   save you from head to foot, who can give His blood to cleanse you, His
   righteousness to cover you, Himself to be All-in-All to you? Soul, if
   you will take a whole Christ, He waits to be received by you! Only
   trust Him and He is yours! "To as many as received Him, to them gave He
   power to become the sons

   of God."

   There was a soul, once, that wanted Christ and, "He blessed him there!"
   There was a soul once that wanted to be rid of sin and, "He blessed him
   there." There was a soul that said, "Lord, save or I perish!" And "He
   blessed him there." There was another whom said, "God be merciful to
   me, a sinner" and, "He blessed him there!" There was one that cried to
   Him and He did not seem to hear--but at last she came in the crowd and
   touched His garment's hem--and He blessed her there! And there was
   another whom He called a dog. "Yet," she said, "the dogs eat of the
   crumbs which fall from their masters' table," and He blessed her there!
   O anxious, seeking, timid, trembling Souls, do trust in Jesus! Rest in
   Jesus and He will bless you now--and you shall go on your way
   rejoicing!

   It was with a young man [In this paragraph, Mr. Spurgeon was evidently
   describing his own experience at his conversion and afterwards] a day
   of seeking and he entered a little sanctuary and heard a sermon from
   the words "Look unto Me, and be you saved." He obeyed the Lord's
   command and, "He blessed him there." Soon after, he made a profession
   of his faith before many witnesses, declaring his consecration to the
   Lord--and "He blessed him there." And soon he began to labor for the
   Lord in little rooms among a few people and, "He blessed him there."
   His opportunities enlarged and, by faith, he ventured upon daring
   things for the Lord's sake--and "He blessed him there." A household
   grew about him and together with his loving wife he tried to train his
   children in the fear of the Lord--and "He blessed him there." Then came
   sharp and frequent trials and he was in pain and anguish, but the Lord
   "blessed him there." This is that man's experience all along--from the
   day of his conversion to this hour! Uphill and down dale his path has
   been a varied one, but for every part of his pilgrimage he can praise
   the Lord, for, "He blessed him there."

   There may perhaps, be some Christians here in trouble. Brother, Sister,
   I do not ask you what your trouble is, and I do not want to know. But
   there is a little text I would like to whisper to you--"Casting all
   your care upon Him, for He

   cares for you." Will you not trust to Him after that? If so, He will
   bless you there! Is your trouble concerning temporal need? Let me put
   this passage into your mouth as a sweet morsel, "Your Father knows what
   things you have need of before you ask Him." Suck that down and He will
   bless you there! Oh, what a blessing will come out of the marrow and
   fatness of that thought! Is there a poor Christian here who says, "I
   feel half ashamed to go to the Communion Table. I am so unworthy"? You
   never were worthy and never will be! Turn your eyes again to the Cross!
   Look to the Savior for worthiness. He will bless you there! "I feel so
   cold and chill," says another. Think of the Savior's love to poor,
   dead, cold sinners such as you are and He will bless you there! If you
   are very cold, it is no use thinking of the cold in order to get
   hot--the best thing is to go to the fire. And if you feel dull and
   dead, do not try to get better by looking within and examining
   yourself--fly away to Jesus Christ and He will bless you there! Let all
   of us now say, "Dear Lord, meet with us, show us Your hands and Your
   side." And if we come to His Throne in that spirit of desire, He will
   bless us there! The Lord be with us all, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW10:24-42.

   Our Lord had been sending forth His 12 Apostles to preach the Gospel of
   the Kingdom and to work miracles in His name. Having given them their
   commission, He warned them of the treatment they could expect to
   receive and then fortified their minds against the persecutions they
   would have to endure.

   Verses 24, 25. The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant
   above his Lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master,
   and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the
   house, Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his
   household?The name, Beelzebub, or Beelzebul, meaning the "god of filth"
   or, as some say, "the god of flies," was applied by the Jews to the
   very worst of the evil spirits. They supposed that there were some
   devils worse than others and the very head and master of them all they
   called Beelzebub. And now they supplied this title to our Lord Jesus,
   Himself! Well then, if men should give us evil names and evil
   characters, need we marvel? Shall Christ be spit upon and despised--and
   shall you and I be honored and exalted? You have heard of Godfrey de
   Bouillon, the Crusader who entered Jerusalem in triumph, but who
   refused to have a golden crown put upon his head because, he said, he
   never would be crowned with gold where Christ was crowned with thorns.
   So do you expect to be honored in the world where your Lord was
   crucified?

   26. Fear them not, therefore, for there is nothing covered that shall
   be revealed; and hidden that shall not be knowi.. "They will
   misrepresent you, slander you and speak evil of you--but if your good
   name is covered up now, it shall be revealed one of these days--perhaps
   in this life, but if not in this life--certainly at the Day of Judgment
   "when the secrets of all hearts shall be made known." It is really
   marvelous how sometimes in this life slandered men suddenly obtain a
   refutation of their accusers and then it seems as if the world would
   serve them as the Greeks did their successful runners or wrestlers when
   they lifted them upon their shoulders and carried them in triumph!

   27. What I tell you in darkness, that speak you in light: and what you
   hear in the ear, that preach you upon the

   housetops. [See Sermon #2674, Volume 46--LEARNING IN PRIVATE WHAT TO
   TEACH IN PUBLIC.] This is what we are to preach--what Christ tells us.
   And this is how we are to get the matter of our discourses--be alone
   with Christ, let Him talk to us in the darkness--in the quietude of the
   closet where we commune with Him in prayer. Then this is where we are
   to preach, "upon the housetops." We cannot literally do this, here in
   this land upon our slanting roofs, but in the East, "the housetops"
   were the most public places in the city--and all of them flat--so that
   anyone proclaiming anything from the housetops would be sure of an
   audience, and especially at certain times of the day! Preach, then, you
   servants of God, in the most public places of the land! Wherever there
   are people to hear, let there not be any lack of tongues to speak for
   God!

   28. And fear not them who kill the body, but are not able to kill the
   soul: but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
   Hell A philosopher--Anaxarchus, I think it was--was known to say when a
   certain tyrant had threatened to kill him, "You cannot kill me. You may
   crush this body, but you cannot touch Anaxarchus." So fear not those
   who cannot kill the soul--if that is safe, you are safe! Even Seneca
   frequently asserted that it was not in the power of any man to hurt a
   good philosopher, "For," he said, "even death is gain to such a man!"
   And certainly it is so to the

   Christian! For him to die is indeed gain! But oh, fear that God who can
   destroy the soul, for then the body, also, is destroyed with a terrible
   and tremendous destruction! "Fear Him."

   29, 30. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall
   not fall on the ground without your Father But the very hairs of your
   head are all numbered. [See Sermon #187, Volume 4--PROVIDENCE.] So
   then, God takes more care of us than we take of ourselves. You never
   heard of a man who numbered the hairs of his head! Men number their
   sheep and their cattle, but the Christian is so precious in God's
   esteem that He takes care of the meanest parts of his frame and numbers
   even the hairs of his head!

   31, 32. Fear you not, therefore, you are of more value than many
   sparrows. Whoever, therefore, shall confess Me before men, him will I
   confess also before My Father which is in Heaven. What a glorious
   promise is this! "I will confess him to have been bought with My blood.
   I will confess him to have been My faithful follower and friend. I will
   confess him to be My brother, and in so doing I will favor him with a
   share of My Glory." Have you confessed Christ before men? If you have
   trusted Him as your Savior, but have not publicly professed your faith
   in Him, however sincere you may be, you are living in the neglect of a
   known duty and you cannot expect to have this promise fulfilled to you
   if you do not keep the condition that is appended to it! Christ's
   promise is to confess those who confess Him. Be you, then, avowedly on
   the Lord's side. "Come out from among them and be you separate, says
   the Lord." Outside the camp the Savior suf-fered--and outside the camp
   must His disciples follow Him, bearing His reproach!

   33. But whoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before
   My Father which is in Heavei. Not to confess Christ is practically to
   deny Him. Not to follow Him is to go away from Him. Not to be for Him
   is to be against Him. Looking at this matter of confessing Christ in
   that light, there is cause for solemn self-examination by all who
   regard themselves as His disciples.

   34. Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send
   peace, but a sword. Do not misunderstand the Savior's words! Christ's
   usually spoke in a very plain manner, and plainness is not always
   compatible with guarded-ness. Christ didcome to make peace--this is the
   ultimate end of His mission, but for the present, Christ did not come
   to make peace. Wherever Christianity comes, it causes a quarrel because
   the light must always quarrel with the darkness and sin can never be
   friendly with righteousness! It is not possible that honesty should
   live in peace with thievery! It cannot be that there should be harmony
   between God's servants and the servants of the devil! In this sense,
   then, understand our Savior's words.

   35. 36. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
   the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her
   mother-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.
   This is always the case, and I suppose will be to the end of the
   chapter. Whenever true religion comes into a man's heart and life,
   those who are without the Grace of God, however near and dear they may
   be to him, will be sure to oppose him!

   37-39. He that loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy ofMe:
   and he that loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy ofMe. And
   he that takes not his cross, and follows after Me, is not worthy ofMe.
   He that finds his life shall lose it: and he that loses his life for My
   sake shall find i. In the days of the martyrs, one man was brought
   before the judges and, through fear of the flames, he recanted and
   denied the faith. He went home, but before the year was ended his own
   house caught fire and he was miserably consumed in it, having had to
   suffer quite as much pain us he would have had to endure for Christ's
   sake but having no consolation in it. He found his life, yet he lost
   it. Now, in a higher degree, all who, to save themselves, shun the
   Cross of Christ, only run into the fire to escape from the sparks! They
   shall suffer more than they would otherwise have done. But whoever is
   willing to give up everything for Christ shall learn that no man is
   ever really a loser by Christ in the long run! Sooner or later, if not
   in this life, certainly in the next, the Lord will abundantly make up
   to every man all that he has ever suffered for His sake. Now comes a
   very delightful passage--

   40. He that receives you, receives Me, and he that receives Me receives
   Him that sent Me. When, therefore, you are kind to the poor. When you
   help the people of God in their difficulties and necessities, you are
   really helping Christ in the person of His poor but faithful followers!

   41. He that receives a Prophet in the name of a Prophet That is, not as
   a gentleman, nor merely as a man, nor as a talented individual, but as
   a Prophet of God--

   41. Shall receive a Prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous
   man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's
   rewart. Just the same reward which God gives to Prophets and righteous
   men, He will give to

   those who receive them in the name of a Prophet or of a righteous man.
   A Prophet's reward must be something great and such shall be the reward
   of those who generously receive the servants of God!

   42. And whoever shall give a drink unto one of these little ones--only
   a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple--verily I say unto you,
   he shall in no wise lose his rewarc. There have been times, even in our
   own country when to give "a cup of cold water" has been to run the risk
   of suffering death. In the dark days of persecution, some who were
   called heretics were driven out into the fields in the depth of winter
   to perish in the cold--the king's subjects were for-bidden--upon pain
   of death, to give them anything either to eat or to drink. Now, in such
   a case as that, giving "a cup of cold water" would mean far more than
   if you or I simply gave a cup of water to someone who happened to be
   thirsty. But our Lord Jesus Christ here promises to reward any who, for
   His servants' sake, will dare to risk any consequences that may fall
   upon themselves.

"A Time to Love"

   (No. 3220)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 6, 1863.

   "A time to love." Ecclesiastes 3:8.

   IF you will look at our text, dear Friends, you will see that it is
   very ominously followed by the words, "and a time to hate." We are
   changeable creatures and we live in an ever-changing world--and this
   Chapter gives an accurate summary of how most of our lives are spent!
   "A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to
   pluck up that which is planted; a time to kill, and a time to heal; a
   time to break down, and a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time
   to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; a time to cast away
   stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a
   time to refrain from embracing; a time to get, and a time to lose; a
   time to keep and a time to cast away; a time to rend, and a time to
   sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; a time to love, and a
   time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace." Ours is a checkered
   life. We are not long in any one state and we quickly change from one
   condition to another--which is sometimes better, but sometimes worse.

   I am not going, however, to speak about these earthly variations, but
   about something that is of a far higher order. And I intend, first, to
   apply the text to Christ's love to us, for He had "a time to love." And
   then, secondly, to apply it to our love to Him, for we, also, have "a
   time to love."

   I. First, then, concerning CHRIST'S LOVE TO US, for He had "a time to
   love."

   Go back with me in thought, Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, to
   the council chamber of eternity. God ordained that Adam, the great
   representative of the human race, would fall in the time of testing and
   that you and I and all mankind would be ruined by his fall. In His
   far-seeing vision, He perceived all of us going astray like lost sheep
   and then arose the necessity for the appointment of a Deliverer to
   rescue us from going down into the Pit. No angels had been created,
   then, and even though they would be, not one in all the shining ranks,
   nor all of them combined, could have saved a single soul! The Savior
   who would be sufficient to accomplish this colossal task must be
   Divine. Then was it with Christ "a time to love," and He came forward
   and entered into an Everlasting Covenant with His Father on His
   people's behalf. Let us never forget that eternal council chamber where
   Christ undertook to be our Surety and Substitute and, in due time, to
   die for us, "the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God."

   Now let your thoughts fly onward to that period when the fullness of
   time for the birth of Christ had come. Will Christ leave His throne,
   His Father's house, the company of the holy angels and the spirits
   ofjust men made perfect? Yes, that He will, for it is with Him now,
   once again, "a time to love." Stripping Himself of all His bright array
   and laying aside all His Glory, He comes down to Bethlehem's lowly
   manger and there I see Him lying in His mother's arms, just as any
   other infant might have done, though He was so wondrously unlike any
   other child that was ever born! Having become Incarnate and having come
   to live here on earth, it was absolutely necessary that a perfect
   righteousness should be worked out on behalf of His people. But in such
   a wicked world as this was then, and still is, this could only be
   accomplished through shame, reproach, rebuke and slander of the most
   abominable kind! Does someone ask, "Did He endure all that?" Yes, that
   He did, for it was with Him, "a time to love." He could truly say,
   "Reproach has broken My heart," yet He willingly bore it for His
   people's sake. The tongue of slander assailed Him so that even His
   miracles were attributed to satanic agency. On the Cross, He was to
   reach the lowest depth of shame and to be "despised and rejected of
   men"--yet He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem--well knowing
   all that would befall Him there.

   His death upon Calvarywas, indeed, "a time to love," for having loved
   His own, He loved them even unto death! But did the Immortal bow His
   head to mortality? Did the Eternal hang in agony upon the accursed
   tree? Yes, that He did, for it was with Him, "a time to love," and many
   waters could not quench His love, neither could the floods drown it.
   Come with me, you who truly love Him, and whose hearts leap with joy as
   you think of His Glory--come with me and see Him in His shame and
   suffering! There is your Lord and Master, of whom you have often sung--

   "Crown Him, crown Him, Crown Him Lord of all"--

   yet look at Him now! You will not wonder to see Him so emaciated as you
   remember the agonies through which He has already passed. There was
   that dreadful night in Gethsemane when His griefs and woes were so
   terrible that His soul was exceedingly sorrowful even unto death and
   His sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling down to the
   ground. Then there was His betrayal by Judas, the forsaking by all His
   disciples, the denial by Peter, the mockery of trials before Annas and
   Caiaphas, Pilate and Herod, the scourging and the spitting and all the
   unknown agonies that He had to endure! Ah, Beloved, we talk very calmly
   about all this, but what must it have been for Christ to suffer thus?
   Why, a little pain soon lets us see what cowards we are--a little
   spittle from slanderous tongues drives us almost to despair! We cannot
   endure much for our Lord's sake, but see how much He endured for our
   sake! Listen to Him as He applies to Himself the prophetic language of
   David in the 22nd Psalm--"I am poured out like water, and all My bones
   are out of joint: My heart is likes wax; it is melted within Me. My
   strength is dried up like a potsherd and My tongue cleaves to my jaws;
   and You have brought Me into the dust of death. For dogs have compassed
   Me: the assembly of the wicked have enclosed Me: they pierced My hands
   and My feet." Surely, now it is with Him, "a time to love." Our sins
   are piled upon Him in a tremendous load that would crush anyone
   else--and that makes even Him to cry, "My God, My God, why have You
   forsaken Me?" This was the love of which Charles Wesley sang--

   "Stronger His love than death or Hell,

   Its riches are unsearchable--

   The first-born sons of light

   Desire in vain its depths to see!

   They cannot reach the mystery,

   The length, and breadth, and height" But has Christ ceased to love us
   now? Oh, no, Beloved, for every day and every moment is with Him, "a
   time to love. "Do you remember when you knew Him not, or only knew Him
   to despise Him? You went to the House of Prayer, but you were godless
   and careless. You heard the preacher inviting his hearers to
   acknowledge Jesus as their King, but you said, "We will not have this
   Man to reign over us!" Perhaps you were among those who cursed His
   name, profaned His Sabbaths and persecuted His people--yet it was with
   Him, "a time to love," and His great love was manifested toward you
   even when you were dead in sins! For Christ to love us when we love Him
   is gracious on His part, but for Him to love us when we hated Him is
   most wondrous of all! Strange, indeed, is it that it should have been
   with Him, "a time to love" when with us it was, "a time to hate."

   Do you remember, too, my Brothers and Sisters, when you did kneel in
   secret before the Lord and your broken heart poured itself out in sighs
   and groans? When you did cry out from the depths of your soul, "God be
   merciful to me, a sinner," did not the Lord say to you, "I have blotted
   out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions and, as a cloud, your sins:
   return unto Me, for I have redeemed you"? And was it not, then, with
   Him, "a time to love"? And since then you have sinned against Him again
   and again, yet He has loved you notwithstanding all! You have had many
   a time when your spirit was cast down within you, yet you have found
   that it was with your Lord, "a time to love" you. You have been many a
   time in the furnace of affliction, yet that, also, has been with your
   Lord, "a time to love" you! When you were despised by your fellows,
   when you were slandered and maligned, did Jesus forsake you? Has He
   ever proved false to you? Has His love toward you ever ceased? Has that
   fountain ever been dried up? No, Beloved, from the first day when He
   called us, by His Grace, even until now it has always been with Him, "a
   time to love." It is so at this moment. You may be slow to embrace Him,
   but He is not slow to embrace you! You may not be saying, with the
   Psalmist, "My heart and my flesh cries out for the living God," but He
   wants to see your face, He longs to hear your voice, for with Him it is
   now, as it has always been, "a time to love."

   You shall also soon fall asleep in Jesus. Your hands shall soon be
   stretched out motionless and your eyes shall be closed in darkness.
   But, thank God, your last hour shall be very specially with your dear
   Lord and Savior, "a time to love" you, and you shall then realize the
   truth and sweetness of Dr. Watts' lines--

   "Jesus can make a dying bed Feel soft as downy pillows are, While on
   His breast I lean my head, And breathe my life out sweetly there."
   Then, in due time, shall come the Resurrection and amidst the splendors
   of that long-looked for day, the great King, stepping down from His
   Throne, shall meet His Spouse, His Church, and clothing her with His
   own Glory, shall take her up to sit with Him upon His Throne and then,
   indeed, shall it be with Him, "a time to love." Then, in the millennial
   age, when--

   "No strife shall vex Messiah's reign, Or mar those peaceful years To
   plowshares men shall beat their swords, To pruning-hooks their
   spears"--

   it shall still be with Christ, "a time to love." And in Heaven, itself,
   when depth and Hell shall have been cast into the Lake of Fire and when
   all the redeemed shall have been gathered home to their Father's house
   where there are many mansions, and the Lord's right hand shall have
   gotten Him the final victory over all His enemies, it shall still be
   with Him, "a time to love."

   II. Now, secondly, we are to apply the text to OUR LOVE TO CHRIST.

   We, also, have often proved that it is with us, "a time to love." Our
   Lord's love to us is the great eternal Fountain from which our love to
   Him always springs, so let it not be unworthy of the Divine source from
   which it flows. Wake up all your powers and passions, Beloved, while I
   try to speak upon this lower, yet truly important theme! If my voice
   should weary you, let your Beloved's voice charm you while He speaks
   right into your hearts.

   When has it been with you, "a time to love"? Go back to the beginning
   of your Christian life. Do you remember that blessed day when Jesus
   first met with you? You can never forget the time when your great load
   of guilt rolled off your shoulders and you were so relieved that you
   felt you must dance for joy! Ah, that was, indeed, "a time to love."
   Young converts, make the best use you can of your earliest consecrated
   hours--let the love of your espousals be inexpressibly sweet. There
   will be many other times of love, but none of them will ever have quite
   the same sweetness as you enjoyed when first you realized that Christ
   had loved you with an everlasting love and, therefore, with loving
   kindness had drawn you unto Himself. Oh, what rapturous fellowship my
   soul had with Him on that never-to-be-forgotten day when--

   "I looked to Jesus and I found In Him my star, my sun"!

   I could have kissed the blessed hands and feet from which flowed the
   blood that cleansed me from all my sins! I could have sung, then, from
   my very soul--

   "Through floods and flames, if Jesus leads, I'll follow where He goes!
   'Hinder me not, 'shall be my cry, Though earth and Hell oppose."

   That was, indeed, in the deepest and best sense, "a time to love."

   Since then, it ought always to have been with us, "a time to love" our
   Lord but, alas, it has not been so, for our hearts have grown cold and
   lukewarmness has stolen upon us. Yet do we not remember when we had to
   forsake all for Christ? Some of you, my Brothers and Sisters in Christ,
   can recall the time when things came to this pass--that your own
   parents and brothers and sisters would have nothing to do with you
   unless you would have nothing to do with Christ. With others of you, it
   was your business that must fail if you keep true to Christ. In some
   instances, it was a very dear friend who threatened to part with you
   forever if you would not part with Christ. But whatever form your trial
   took, I feel sure that it was with you, "a time to love" your Lord with
   even greater intensity than before--that is to say, if you ever loved
   Him at all. I think it is really "a time to love" the Savior when it
   costs us something to love Him. And I can bear my testimony that there
   is never a better "time to love" the Savior than when most everybody
   seems to be against

   you. I can never forget that night in the Surrey Gardens Music Hall
   when such a terrible calamity happened while I was preaching to an
   immense congregation. I was blamed by many as though I had caused the
   catastrophe. For a time, it seemed as though my brain could not recover
   from the dreadful shock that it received when I realized what had taken
   place! My spirit had sunk to the very lowest depths of despair, but one
   day, as I was walking in the garden to which I had been taken for
   seclusion and quiet, all of a sudden this passage came to my
   mind--"Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him a name
   which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should
   bow, of things in Heaven, and things in earth, and things under the
   earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,

   to the glory of God the Father." [See Sermon #101, Volume 2--THE
   EXALTATION OF CHRIST.] In a moment, the thought came to me that as long
   as Christ was exalted, it did not matter what became of me! If my King
   was crowned. If my Captain gained the victory, it did not matter even
   if He allowed me to be flung upon the dunghill as worthless and
   permitted my name to be slandered by every tongue and every pen! Then
   was my soul quieted and my heart found rest and, it was, indeed, to me,
   "a time to love" my Lord more than ever as I thought of His present
   exaltation and His future universal triumph!

   Beloved, you have sometimes had a sense of sin that has made you
   thoroughly wretched. But you have gone again to the--

   "Fountain filled with blood"--

   and you have received renewed tokens of your Lord's favor and that has
   been to you, "a time to love" Him still more ardently! Have you
   backslidden, and has your loving Lord knocked at the door of your heart
   until you have let Him in again? Then that has surely been to you, "a
   time to love" Him most intensely. Have you had--

   "Streams of mercy, never ceasing"? Have you been permitted to prosper
   in this world? Then, surely, that was "a time to love" your Lord for
   all His goodness to you. On the other hand, did your riches take to
   themselves wings and fly away, or were those who were very dear to you,
   called Home to be with Jesus? Then that, also, was "a time to love"
   your Lord, for we often love Christ all the more when we lose everyone
   else and everything else! Rutherford put this thought very sweetly when
   he was writing to one who had lost first her husband, and then each of
   her children, one by one. "Your Ladyship must be very dear to the heart
   of Christ," he wrote, "or He would not try you as He does. He takes
   such delight in your love that He would have every atom of it for
   Himself--so He took your husband first, for He said, 'I will have the
   husband's share of her love.' Then you poured out your love upon your
   first-born, his father's heir, and Jesus took him, for He said, 'I will
   have the share of love that she gives to her eldest son.' So it went on
   until you had only one of your darlings left, your Benjamin, and He
   said, 'I will have Benjamin's portion,' so He took him, also, away that
   He might have all your Ladyship's love for Himself. And," added
   Rutherford, "I often wish that He would think as much of me and try me
   in some such way as that." So, Beloved, when trial has come to you, I
   trust that you, also, have proved it to be "a time to love" your Lord
   more than you have ever done before!

   And when your brethren grow cold and the Church as a whole gets lax,
   when you have to sorrowfully cry, "How sadly the faithful are failing
   from among men!" then is it "a time to love" your Lord with all the
   greater fervency because the love of so many is waxing cold! When the
   mortal and the human prove how frail and fickle they are, then lay hold
   the more firmly on Him who is Immortal and Divine--and who will,
   therefore--never disappoint those who put their trust in Him. And, on
   the other hand, when you are able to rejoice in real fellowship with
   your Brothers and Sisters in Christ, then it is also, "a time to love,"
   so gather up all the love of all the saints into one great bundle, put
   your own into the middle of it and give it all to Christ Jesus your
   dear Lord and Savior!

   I was thinking, this afternoon, while meditating upon this theme, that
   this is my "time to love." I can never tell how long it may please the
   Lord to spare me to this people. That is no concern of mine, but I am
   greatly concerned to work with all my might for my gracious Lord and
   Master while I may. So long as I am your pastor, I feel a holy anxiety
   to get out of you, for the glory of God, all that you can render to Him
   of sacred service. I feel that it is the minister's business not only
   to be like the vinedresser who cares for the vine in all the various
   stages of its growth, but he must also be like the treader of grapes
   who seeks to get every drop of the luscious liquid out of the purple
   clusters beneath his feet. I long to see the rich wine of your souls'
   affections flowing out to your Lord to the very last drop--and it would
   be a most comforting thing to me, even in dying, if I could say, "I
   have been helped to make my people's hearts warm with Jesus' love,

   to loosen their tongues to proclaim to others His immense, unsearchable
   love, to set their hands busily to work for Christ in many ways and to
   start their feet running to search out the Lord's stray sheep and bring
   them back to His fold!" This, then, is my "time to love."

   But Brother and Sister in Christ, is it not also your "time to love"?
   Think what opportunities you have down here of showing your love to
   your Lord and Savior! Even in Heaven you will not be able to do what
   you can do on earth in the way of succoring the needy, helping the
   feeble, comforting the desponding, reclaiming the backsliding and
   seeking to point sinners to the crucified Savior! The angels can
   prostrate themselves adoringly before the Throne of God, but they
   cannot teach the children in our Ragged schools. Redeemed and glorified
   spirits can join in the everlasting hallelujahs of the skies, but they
   can no longer climb up creaking staircases in the haunts of poverty and
   minister to the sick and dying who lie languishing there. They can
   still praise their Lord, but they cannot preach Him! They can talk to
   one another of His love, but they cannot make it known to lost and
   helpless sinners as you and I can. So let this, Beloved, be our "time

   to love."

   That Communion Table, where many of us will presently gather to
   commemorate our Savior's dying love reminds us that whenever we come to
   our Lord's Table, it should be with us "a time to love." What love is
   pictured in those emblems of our blessed Master's broken body and
   poured-out blood! He knew how prone we would be to forget Him, so He
   instituted this memorial ordinance on purpose to remind us of Him as
   often as we should partake of it. The bread and the wine are reminders,
   not only of Christ's great love to us, but also of His ardent desire
   that we should love Him. Can I, my Lord, dare partake of those sacred
   emblems and yet not love You with my whole heart and soul? If the days
   of persecution were to come back, how many of us would be willing to go
   to the stake and be burned alive rather than give up our love to
   Christ? Yet think of all that He endured for us! He gave His back to
   the smiters and His cheeks to them that plucked out His hair--and He
   hid not His face from shame and spitting! My gracious Master, You have
   given Your flesh and Your blood to be the spiritual food of my
   soul--give me the Grace to consecrate my flesh and blood and all the
   powers of my body, soul, and spirit to You and to Your blessed service!
   Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, come with me and fall down
   before the Lord in loving adoration--

   "Words are but air, and tongues but clay"-- reverent silence seems
   congenial to such a theme as this--

   "Love Divine, all loves excelling,

   Joy of Heaven, to earth come down." Blessed Jesus, how can we
   adequately praise such love as Yours? Oh, for a heart that could be all
   on fire and for a body that should be like a smoking sacrifice offered
   up as a whole burnt-offering to You! Well, if we cannot have this while
   we are still in this imperfect state, we must look forward to another
   "time to love" our Lord more fervently than we can ever do here below!
   But, by-and-by, when we reach the blessed land beyond the river, when
   we shall sit down at the King's own table in Glory, when we shall feast
   upon such dainties as we have never seen or tasted upon earth, then,
   indeed, will it be "a time to love" to the highest degree that is
   possible to the glorified spirits above!

   Now I have finished my discourse when I have said how grieved I am that
   all of you do not experimentally know what I have been talking about.
   Oh, that you all really knew the love of Christ! Your eyes must be
   blind, indeed, if you cannot see the beauties of Jesus! Your ears must
   be deaf if you cannot hear His charming voice! And your hearts as hard
   as adamant--are you made of such Hell-hardened steel that you will not
   love my Lord and Master? By those wounds that He endured even for His
   enemies, by that blood which so freely flowed for those who were then
   His foes, by those languid eyes so full of pity for sinners, by that
   loving heart overflowing with compassion for the vilest of the vile, I
   implore you to tell me--Can you look at Him and not love Him? Can you
   think of Him as He hung upon Calvary's Cross and not put your soul's
   trust in Him? Come and see if there is any sorrow that is like unto His
   sorrow--

   "All you that pass by, to Jesus draw nigh,

   To you is it nothing that Jesus should die?" Look at Him dying there,
   "the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." And if God
   the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see Him and give you the Grace
   to trust Him, you will gladly enough yield to Him the love of your
   hearts! And if you once really love Him, you will gladly be His servant
   forever! I cannot comprehend how it is that some of us are so cold
   towards the Lord Jesus Christ. How is it that we can, even for a
   moment, tolerate that wicked, that diabolical

   Laodicean lukewarmness towards Him whose love is like a flaming fire?
   Come, Holy Spirit, give us coals of juniper! No, give us of Your own
   Divine sacred fire--

   "Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,

   With all Your quickening powers,

   Come shed abroad a Savior's love--

   And that shall kindle ours." Then shall it indeed be with us "a time to
   love." God grant that it may be so, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: SONG OF SOLOMON 4.

   This is a chapter which is, perhaps, more adapted for private
   meditation than for rending in public. Nevertheless, as this is a
   communion season, and I trust that the most of us are partakers of the
   life of God, I could not resist reading it this evening. It is a love
   song, the song of the loves of Jesus. As He sets forth the beauties and
   charms of His Church, may the same beauties and charms be found in
   everyone of us through the Grace which He imparts to us by His Spirit!
   May we, as parts of His mystical body, be fair and lovely in His esteem
   because He has bestowed upon us so much of His own loveliness! Let us
   walk so carefully with God that there may be nothing to put even a spot
   upon our garments, or to defile our Grace-given comeliness.

   Verse 1. Behold, you are fair, My love; behold, you are fair "Twice
   fair, first, through being washed in My blood and next, through being
   sanctified by My Spirit!"

   1. You have doves' eyes within your locks. Jesus prizes the love of His
   people which flashes forth from their eyes as they look upon Him. The
   good works of His people, like the locks of hair which are the beauty
   and glory of the female form, are the beauty of the Church and of every
   individual Believer. It is a beautiful thing to have the eyes of faith
   glistening between the locks of our good works to the praise and glory
   of God!

   1. Your hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Mount Gileat. O my
   Soul, see that you have many such acceptable works of faith and labors
   of love!

   2. Your teeth--Those parts of our spiritual being with which we feed
   upon Christ, and masticate and assimilate the Word. "Your teeth"--

   2. Are like a flock of sheep that are evenly shorn, which came up from
   the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among
   them. We should seek so to feed upon the Word as to become fruitful by
   it. If we spiritually feed upon the flesh of Christ, we shall
   afterwards be the means of bringing forth an abundant harvest of
   holiness to His praise and honor.

   3. Your lips are like a thread of scarlet And well they may be, for
   what is there for the Believer to talk about but the scarlet of the
   Savior's blood--that matchless bath in which we are washed whiter than
   snow? My mouth, be you filled with the praises of the Lord, that my
   lips may be like a thread of scarlet!

   3. And your speech is comely. There is always a comeliness in that
   conversation which is full of Christ! So, Beloved, let your
   conversation always be such as becomes the Gospel of Christ. But that
   cannot be the case unless there is much of Christ in it.

   3. Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within your locks.
   Those parts of us with which we think upon God's Word should always be
   surrounded by good works. Doctrines in the head, without holinessin the
   life, are of no service. But when the temples are covered with the
   locks of righteousness, then are they like a piece of a pomegranate,
   acceptable both to God and men.

   4. Your neck is like the Tower of David built for an armory. And what
   is this but our faith? Does not the neck join the body to the head--and
   is not faith that connecting link by which we are united to Christ? Oh,
   for that faith which is like the Tower of David built for an armory! It
   is sure to be assaulted--let it, therefore, be firmly founded and fully
   armed.

   4. Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty met.
   They hung up their bucklers in memory of their triumphs. Read the 11th
   Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which is a record of the
   victories of faith. The prom-

   ises of God are also like these bucklers which are hung up in the
   armory! Let us be so familiar with them that we shall have them ready
   for use in every emergency.

   5. Your two breasts are like two young roes that are twins which feed
   among the lilies. The ordinances of God's House are very delightful to
   Christ and to His people, too. And consequently, that part of our
   spiritual being which seeks to feed others and specially to nourish the
   young Believer, is very precious in Christ's esteem. When He has
   finished the description of His Church, Christ says--

   6. Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, I will get Me to the
   mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. Our Beloved has
   gone away from us until the day of His reappearing--until the night of
   His Church's anxiety is over and the Sun of Righteousness shall arise
   with healing in His wings! Jesus has gone from earth, but where is He?
   He has gone to intercede for us before the Throne of His Father! He has
   gone to where there are mountains of myrrh. Think, Beloved, of the
   sweet perfume that always arises from His one great Sacrifice for sins!
   Well may He compare it to a mountain of myrrh and to a hill of
   frankincense!

   7. You are all fair, My love, there is no spot in you. Drink that truth
   in, Christian. If ever there was a honeycomb full of virgin honey, it
   is here. Though in yourself you are defiled, yet in the eyes of Jesus,
   looked upon as covered with His righteousness, "you are all fair." No,
   more--"there is no spot in you." You are as dear to Him as though you
   had never sinned! Yes, in His sight you appear without a single fault!
   He has so cleansed you in His precious blood that "there is no spot in
   you."

   8. Come with Me from Lebanon, My spouse, with Me from Lebanon: look
   from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir andHermon, from the
   lions' den, from the mountains of the leopards. My Heart, leave the
   world! Leave its sweet places--though Lebanon is full of
   fragrance--leave it! Leave the world's high places. Though the top of
   Amana may seem to reach to Heaven, leave even that to have communion
   with your Lord! "Come out from among them, and be you separate, says
   the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing." The best spots in the world
   are for you, O Spouse of Christ, but lions' dens and mountains of
   leopards! You are always in danger while you consort with worldlings,
   you are always in peril while you are entangled with the world--so get
   away from Lebanon, from Amana, from Shenir and Hermon-- leave
   everything for your Lord!

   9. You have ravished My heart. I think the Septuagint reads it, "You
   have unhearted me," as if Christ's people had taken away His heart so
   that it was all theirs, and not His any longer. "You have ravished My
   heart."

   9. My sister, My spouse, you have ravished My heart with one of your
   eyes, with one chain of your neck. The eyes of love and the neck of
   faith with its chain, hold captive the heart of Christ--

   "So dear, so very dear to Christ, Dearer I cannot be.

   The love wherewith God loves His sons, Such is Christ's love to me!"

   Oh, what a miracle of mercy it is that Christ, Himself, should be
   unhearted by such foul and loathsome creatures as we were! Yet He loved
   us so that He would have us and, having determined to do so, He put a
   beauty upon us that is really now worthy of His love! I speak
   advisedly, for the righteousness of Christ and the sanctification of
   the Spirit have in them something so fair that Christ does not now love
   that which is unworthy of His love--that righteousness which He has
   Himself worked in us now rightly claims His affection.

   10. How fair is Your love, My sister, My spousef. [See Sermon #282,
   Volume 5--CHRIST'S ESTIMATE OF HIS PEOPLE.] Hear that, O Spouse of
   Christ? Your love is often very cold, very feeble and, even at its
   best, it is not what you would have it to be, nor what it ought to be.
   Yet Jesus values it highly and says, "How fair is your love, My sister,
   My spouse!"

   10. How much better is your love than wine! Yet He knows what the best
   wine is like, for He is one day to drink it new with us in His Father's
   Kingdom, yet He says that the love of His people is much better than
   wine, yes, even than that wine.

   10. And the smell of your ointments than all spices! You know that He
   has the smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia upon His garments when He
   comes out of the ivory palaces, yet He considers that His people's
   graces are sweeter than all the spices that ever grew.

   11, 12. Your lips, O My spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk
   are under your tongue; and the smell of your garments is like the smell
   of Lebanon. A garden enclosed is My sister, My spouse; a spring shut
   up, a fountain

   sealed. [See Sermons #431, Volume 8--A SECRET AND YET NO SECRET and
   #1957, Volume 33--THE LORD'S OWN VIEW OF HIS CHURCH AND PEOPLE.] Oh,
   that my heart were like that at this moment! Jesus, shut the gates and
   shut out the world, and every wandering, wayward, sinful thought! Then
   shut Yourself in my heart and walk in it as in a garden that is walled
   around into which no intruders dare enter!

   13, 14. Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant
   fruits; camphire, with spikenard, spikenard and saffron; calamus and
   cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the
   chief spices. Oh, that this were fully true of us--that all our
   thoughts, words, and actions, which are like the fruits of the garden,
   were as full of spices of heavenly fragrance as Jesus here declares
   that He thinks them to be! Yet, alas, how little we do for Him, though
   He sets such store by our little that He regards it as much!

   15. A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from
   Lebanon. Such should the whole Church and each individual Believer be.
   O my Soul, be not only shut up for Christ, but be, when the time comes,
   opened to do good to all the world! Oh, that I might be like a well of
   living waters in my speech at all times! And that you, my beloved
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, whenever you are dealing with others,
   might be a well of living waters to every thirsty soul! Speak of Jesus
   wherever you go! Talk of Jesus whenever you can! You have been shut up
   and Christ has been in you--now be opened to give forth to others what
   He has given you! The Chapter concludes with a delightful prayer. Let
   us, each one, pray it--

   16. Awake, O north wind, and come, you south; blow upon my garden, that
   the spices thereof may flow out. Let my

   "MY GARDEN"--"HIS GARDEN."] The Church here, you see, desires to

   feel two opposite winds. Though it should be the rough north wind of
   affliction that blows upon her, if it will but make her spices flow,
   she will be glad. But if it is the soft south wind of blessed and
   hallowed fellowship with her Lord, she is equally pleased, for what she
   longs after is that her Lord may take delight in her.

"Yet There Is Room"

   (No. 3221)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1910,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   DECEMBER 21, 1862.

   "And yet there is room." Luke 14:22.

   I REMINDED YOU, this morning, [See Sermon #485, Volume 8--NO ROOM FOR
   CHRIST IN THE INN.] that there was no room for Christ and His parents
   in the inn at Bethlehem--and also that there were then other places
   where, although there was no room for Christ, far inferior persons
   found a welcome and entertainment. I need, this evening, to convince
   you that although there are still many sinners who seem to have no room
   for Christ in their hearts and lives, yet there is plenty of room for
   sinners in the heart and love of Christ! And I am going to give them an
   earnest, tender, affectionate invitation to come to Christ while "yet
   there is room." You who have hitherto been strangers to the Grace of
   God. You who, as yet, have never feasted at the Gospel Banquet, you who
   have, until now, been content with this world's frothy dainties and
   have never tasted that which is substantial and satisfying for time and
   for eternity--to you, even to you--comes the message of our text, "yet
   there is room."

   I. My first question concerning the text is, WHERE IS THERE ROOM? And
   the answer is, there is room in the Fountain opened for sin and for
   uncleanness! There is room for you to be washed and to be made clean.
   Vast multitudes have gone into that Fountain black as the thickest
   night--and they have come up from the washing "whiter than snow."
   Innumerable offenses have there been washed away, but the Fountain has
   lost none of its cleansing power, nor will it until the last elect soul
   has been washed therein, as Cowper so confidently and so truly sings--

   "Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood

   Shall never lose its power

   Till all the ransomed Church of God

   Is saved to sin no more!" It is our joy to be able to assure you that
   in that blessed bath of cleansing, "yet there is room!"

   There is room, too, in that chariot of love which carries the washed
   ones all the way to Heaven--that chariot of which Solomon's was a type
   and of which we read, "he made the pillars thereof of silver, the
   bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof
   being paved with love for the daughters of Jerusalem." In this chariot
   there is room for millions more--and if you are washed in His precious
   blood, He who is greater than Solomon will take you up and carry you on
   and over the rough and rugged road of this wilderness world--and
   conduct you safely to His Father's House above. You shall travel
   joyously in the best of company, so enter while there is room, Sinner,
   and there is room now!

   There is room, too, in the Father's great family. He has adopted an
   innumerable multitude of those who once were children of wrath and
   servants of Satan! He has selected some of the vilest of the sons and
   daughters of Adam, but they are washed, they are cleansed, they are
   regenerate and they have received the seal of their adoption into the
   family of God and are joyously crying, "Abba, Father!" But there is
   room for millions more in that great family! Earthly fathers, as a
   general rule, have no room for strangers in their home--the house is
   already crowded with their own boys and girls--so they cannot receive
   other people's children into their family. But there is still room in
   the great Father's heart for all who will come unto Him by Jesus
   Christ, His Son. All whom He has chosen unto eternal life have not yet
   believed in Jesus and been "sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,
   which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the
   purchased possession." All whom He intends to save have not yet been
   brought to recognize Him as their Father and

   their God, so again I say that there is still room in the great
   Father's heart for all who will come unto Him by Jesus Christ, His Son!

   There is room, too, in the visible Church here below. We gladly welcome
   every new convert and we say to each one--

   "Come in, you blessed of the Lord, Stranger nor foe are thou! We
   welcome you with warm accord, Our friend, our Brother now."

   "The Lord knows them that are His," but all that are the Lord's are not
   yet added to His visible Church. Thousands of them stray in the paths
   of sin--millions of them are as yet like jewels hidden away in the
   mire, or pearls lying many fathoms deep in the caverns of the sea!
   There is still room for more stars in the diadem that adorn the brows
   of the Church on earth! There is still room for more golden
   candlesticks to give her light. She still has room for many more
   children to be dandled on her knees and to suck at her breasts--use
   whatever metaphor we may, we can still say, in the words of our
   text--"yet there is room."

   There is room, too, in the ordinances of God's House. There is room for
   you, Christian Brother or Sister, in the liquid tomb which is the
   emblem of your Savior's grave! You may be buried with Him by Baptism
   into death and rise from the baptistery in the likeness of His
   Resurrection, therefore to walk with Him in newness of life! There is
   room for you, too, at that Communion Table where, in eating bread and
   drinking wine, we spiritually eat Christ's flesh and drink His blood
   and so prove that He dwells in us and we dwell in Him.

   There is room for you at the children's table--you will not overcrowd
   us! We are not like the elder brother who was jealous because the
   prodigal was welcomed back to his father's house and his father's
   table. We shall have none the less enjoyment, but all the more, if you
   will come and join us at the feast of love--there is abundant room for
   you there.

   Better, still, and more to your soul's solace, there is room for you in
   Heaven! The long procession has been streaming through the gates of
   pearl from the day when Abel, the protomartyr, entered the heavenly
   city, until this very moment, as I am speaking to you! The last
   emancipated soul has just flapped its wings for joy, left its mortal
   cage behind and entered into everlasting liberty! The redeemed from
   among men have been taking their appointed places before the Throne of
   God, waving their palms, wearing their crowns, playing their golden
   harps and singing their songs of victory! But there is still room in
   Heaven for many more! There are crowns there without heads to wear them
   and harps without hands to play them--and mansions without tenants to
   inhabit them and streets of gold that shall have something lacking
   until you have trodden them--if you are one of the Lord's own people.
   There is room for multitudes whom God has cho-sen--to come to swell the
   hallelujah chorus of the skies! It is very sweet even now, but it has
   not yet reached its full force and grandeur--it needs to have ten
   thousand times ten thousand voices added to the already mighty
   choir--and then the glorious chorus shall roll up to the Throne of God
   louder than the noise of many waters and as the voice of a great
   thunder, "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! for the Lord God
   Omnipotent reigns! And He shall reign forever and ever!"

   What a dreary message I would have to deliver if I had to tell you that
   there was no room! Let me give you one or two illustrations. In passing
   over some of the more difficult passes of the Alps, the traveler sees
   small habitations by the side of the road, marked "Refuge No. 1,"
   "Refuge No. 2," and so on, up to the hospice on the summit, and then
   down the other side more refuges similarly marked. When a storm comes
   on and the wind and snow beat into a man's face so that he cannot see
   his way, and he sinks more than knee-deep in the drifts--it is a happy
   circumstance for him that, perhaps a little way ahead, there is a
   refuge where he and others in the same plight may find shelter till
   hospitable monks come and take them to the hospice, or send them on
   their way! Imagine that one dark night the snow is pouring down, the
   flakes fall so thickly that you cannot see a star, the wind howls among
   the Alps and the poor traveler, nearly blinded, staggers up to the door
   of the refuge--but he sees outside of it a dozen or two other travelers
   all clustered together, nearly frozen to death, and they say to
   him--"The refuge is crammed! We can't get in, so we must perish, though
   we have reached the door of the refuge but there is no room for us
   inside." Ah, but I have no such bad news as that to bring to you
   tonight! Crowded as you are here, this great building has scarcely room
   enough to hold you--but the love of Christ is not so cramped that I
   need say to you, "There is no room here." "Yet there is room." All who
   are inside the refuge are but a small number compared with those who
   are yet to come for, in later and brighter ages, of which this is but

   the dawn, we believe that conversion work will go on far more rapidly
   and that the Lord's elect will be brought to Him in much greater
   numbers than in these days! Whether it will be so or not, it is our joy
   to tell you that "yet there is room" in the great Gospel Refuge which
   the Lord of the Way has so graciously provided for all who will enter
   it!

   Here is another picture. There has been a wreck out there upon the
   coast. The ship has struck upon the rocks and she is fast going to
   pieces. Some of the poor mariners are clinging to the mast--they have
   been hanging there for hours. Heavy seas have broken over them and they
   can hardly retain their hold. Some of the crew have already become
   exhausted and have fallen off into the deep--and the others who are
   clinging for dear life are almost frozen with cold! But look there--a
   rocket goes up--they believe that they have been spotted and, after a
   while, they see that a lifeboat is coming to their rescue! Perhaps the
   brave men give a cheer as they row with all their might to let the pour
   shipwrecked sailors know that there is help at hand. As the lifeboat
   comes nearer, its captain cries, "Oh, what a lot of men! What can we do
   with so many? We will take as many of you as we can, but there is not
   room for all." The men are helped off the wreck, one after the other,
   until they seem to fill the boat. Each man's place has two crammed into
   it, but at last the captain says, "It's no use. We can't take any more.
   Our boat is so full that she'll go down if we put in another man." It's
   all over with those poor souls that must be left behind, for before the
   gallant boat can make another trip, they must all have fallen into the
   waves of the sea and been lost.

   But I have no such sad tale to tell you tonight, for my Master's Gospel
   Lifeboat has thus far taken in but few compared with those she will yet
   take! I know not how many she will hold, but this I do know, that a
   multitude which no man can number shall be found within her and, amid
   songs of everlasting joy, they shall all be safely landed on the
   blessed shore where rocks and tempests will never again trouble them!
   The lifeboat is not yet full--there is still room in her for all who
   will trust in Jesus! Poor Mariner, give up clinging to that wreck on
   the rocks! Poor Sinner, give up clinging to your works and to your
   sins! There is room in the Gospel Lifeboat for you and all who will put
   themselves under the care of the great Captain of Salvation, our Lord
   and Savior Jesus Christ!

   II. Now we will change our view of the subject by asking and answering
   a second question, WHEN IS THERE ROOM? Lay the emphasis upon the word,
   "yet," in the text. " Yet there is room." " Yet!"Ages have marched
   along with solemn tramp, generations have followed generations and all
   have yielded their quota to the great Church of Jesus Chr-ist--but,
   "yet there is room" for millions more! There have been multitudes
   passing through the valley of repentance up to the Cross of Calvary!
   Multitudes beyond all human calculation have found peace and pardon in
   Christ! But, for all that, "yet there is room!" A few years ago the
   Churches of our land, and especially the Churches of Ireland, had a
   visitation of Divine Grace when many were converted to God. And in this
   Church we have had a revival that has lasted all the years of our
   pastorate. We have had no special season of revival--there has been a
   continual revival, practically all the time, at New Park Street, at
   Exeter Hall, at the Surrey Gardens and here in this Tabernacle. The
   blessed work of conversion goes on, never slowly, but quite as fast as
   we can keep pace with it! The Lord is constantly adding to our numbers!
   Sometimes, as on the last occasion, 74 in a single month! On another
   occasion, a hundred! But we can still say, "yet there is room," and if
   all the Churches in London and throughout the whole kingdom were to be
   multiplied exceedingly, we feel that we could still come to our pulpits
   as revival years passed over us and say, "yet there is room."

   Besides, Sinner, you are getting old now. Those gray hairs tell a tale
   of years that have passed. Your youth fled long ago and your early
   manhood is now over--God knows how you have spent it--but you are here,
   tonight, like an old barren tree, almost ready for the everlasting
   burning unless Sovereign Grace shall save you even now! And I am here
   to tell you that "yet there is room!" How old are you? Are you sixty?
   Are you past seventy? Can you look back over 80 years? Are you getting
   close to ninety? Well, even then, "yet there is room," for you and if
   you had outnumbered the years of Moses, yes, and if you had lived as
   long as Methuselah lived, I would still say to you, "yet there is
   room!"

   Think, too, of the many times that you have rejected Christ. Again and
   again the invitations of the great Giver of the Gospel Feast have been
   sent to you, but you have refused them all! Before I was born, some of
   you old people had many loving warnings and entreaties from godly
   ministers who have long since gone Home. You were not altogether
   unmoved by your mother's prayers and your father's supplications, and
   now, in these latter times, it has pleased God to speak to you by one
   who is so much younger than you--in words that would burn if they
   could, coming as they do, red-hot from a heart that is all on fire with
   love to your souls! My words have often reached your ears and have
   sometimes reached your consciences, too, yet the Lord knows how many
   vows have been made in this House and broken at the door--how many
   impressions have been made during the sermon--and obliterated before
   you have reached your homes! There are some of you who will find in me
   a swift witness against you at the bar of God! If you should say that
   you never heard the Gospel, I will testify that you have heard it
   plainly and faithfully declared time after time. I have not preached as
   I wish I could, but you have always been able to understand my message!
   I have not sought to find gaudy words and polished periods with which I
   might tickle your ears, but in God's name, I have told you that unless
   you repent and believe, you shall surely perish! And I have preached to
   you the love of Jesus and pointed you to His wounds and bid you look
   unto Him and live. Yet you have rejected every warning and every
   invitation that I have given you up till now. But, notwithstanding
   that, I am still sent to say to you, "Yet there is room--yet there is
   room."

   It may be that some of you have been adding sin to sin till you have
   now got to such a pitch as you never dreamed that you would reach.
   There is that young man over there in the gallery, who used to be at
   every Prayer Meeting and used to attend one of the Bible classes and
   all the services. You know, young man, to whom I am referring--that
   young man did run well, but he first went astray just a little bit and
   then still more--then he went from bad to worse and now he has gone to
   the worst of all! Let it never be told where it may reach his father's
   ears, what sin he has committed only this week! Ah, young man, if you
   had been told, even a little while ago, that you would sin thus, you
   would have said, as Hazael said to Elisha, "But what? Is your servant a
   dog that he should do this great thing?" You would not have believed
   yourself capable of falling so low as to commit the offense in which
   you have now indulged! And I venture to prophesy that although you
   think you have repented of it, you will return to it as the dog turns
   to his own vomit and as the sow that was washed returns to her
   wallowing in the mire! There are some sinners who never seem to be
   satisfied till they have gone to the full limit of their tether. They
   are like the waves of the sea that must keep on advancing until they
   have reached their flood tide and can go no further. Yet Sinner, though
   all this is so terribly true of you, though you have gone as far as you
   can go in sin, "yet there is room" even for you in that cleansing
   Fountain of which I spoke a few minutes ago!

   Probably I am addressing some who will never see another year roll over
   their heads. No, I may say that it is an absolute certainty concerning
   not merely one or two, but concerning many here present! I do not know
   how many out of the six or seven thousand persons now present will,
   according to the ordinary rate of mortality, die within a year from
   this night, but certainly a considerable number will. Therefore I am
   not talking fanatical nonsense, but solid truth! There are some persons
   here who will not even see another month on earth--and very many who
   will never see another year. And there may be at least one here who
   will not see even another day! How near this makes us feel to the
   unseen world, how close to death! I have known many such cases as this.
   One of the officers or members of the Church meets me as I am coming
   in, and says to me, "Do you remember So-and-So?" "Yes, I think I do.
   Where does he sit?" "Well, there is his seat." "Oh, yes!" I reply, "I
   remember him well. What about him?" "Why," says the friend, "last
   Sunday morning, as he was walking home after the service here, he was
   taken ill, went straight to bed and died." Some of you know the Brother
   to whom I am referring. Not long ago, another friend said to me, "Do
   you know Mr. So-and-So?" "Oh, yes!" I answered, "why do you ask?"
   "Well, dear Pastor," he said, "the Lord has been pleased to call her to
   Himself quite suddenly." It is often thus--the stroke falls where it
   was least expected and God, in a moment, calls one and another of our
   friends to meet their final doom. We cannot say to any of those who
   have been called away from our midst, "yet there is room," but we can
   say it to you who are here!

   III. I think I have dwelt long enough on that word, "yet." I want in
   closing to ask another question, WHY IS

   THERE ROOM?

   How do we know that there is still room? Well, our text is enough to
   make us sure, even if we had nothing else, but we have other reasons
   for knowing, "yet there is room." And the first reason is because the
   decree of election is vast and wide. Those individuals who try to
   caricature our doctrinal sentiments are in the habit of saying that we
   teach that God has chosen a few to be saved and left the great majority
   of mankind to perish. They know that we have never said any such thing!
   And they also know that no man of any standing in our denomination has
   ever said any such a thing! On the contrary, we believe that God has
   ordained a countless host, so numerous that no man can number it, who
   shall be everlastingly saved! And we think we have some warrant for
   believing that the number of the saved will vastly exceed the number of
   the lost, that in all things Christ may have the preeminence.
   Certainly, whatever may be our opinion upon that matter, we rejoice
   that the lines of Divine Election are not narrow, that the chosen
   people of God are not a mere hand-

   ful--and we believe that when the time comes for the great King to make
   up His jewels, it shall be found that the case contains such multitudes
   of them that they shall be beyond all human calculation! It is our joy
   to know that God has chosen a great host to be saved and, as they have
   not all been saved yet, it is clearly proved that, "yet there is room!"

   Again, we believe that Christ offered an Infinite Sacrifice for the
   redemption of His people. We cannot look at His blessed Person as the
   God-Man, Christ Jesus, without believing that the sufferings of such a
   Substitute for sinners must have had an infinite value--so we are fully
   persuaded that no limit can be set to the merit of Christ's
   death--although we also believe that Christ had a definite purpose in
   His death which cannot be frustrated--and that this purpose was the
   salvation, not of all men--but of as many as His Father had given Him,
   according to His own words, "I lay down My life for the sheep." And
   according to Paul's words, "Christ loved the church and gave Himself
   for it." Yet so great a Sacrifice as that of Christ could not have been
   offered without a great objective in view! In fact, He told His
   disciples that "the Son of Man came...to give His life a ransom for
   many." We therefore believe that in the great fold wherein the Good
   Shepherd preserves His blood-bought sheep, there is yet room for many
   more to enter!

   Further, we come to the same conclusion by considering the great design
   of God in the whole of His Providential arrangements--in the permission
   of the Fall and in the wondrous plan by which the Fall, itself, is made
   to minister to God's Glory by being a foil, a dark background, to set
   forth the brightness of the Divine Grace which delivers sinners from
   eternal ruin! We believe that the objective of the Covenant of Grace
   and of the plan of Redemption so amazing as that which is revealed in
   the Scriptures could not have been a small one! It must be a great
   multitude of redeemed souls that will satisfy Christ for the terrible
   travail of soul that He endured--it cannot be an insignificant company
   that will be won by His almighty hands and His holy arms, but a mighty
   host who shall be the fulfillment of the Lord's eternal design and
   bring to Him due honor and glory forever and ever! Therefore, also for
   this reason we are persuaded that "yet there is room."

   Moreover, Brothers and Sisters, when we consider the prevalence of
   Jesus 'plea and the Omnipotence of the Holy Spirit's agency.When we see
   the daily preparation which God makes for sending out fresh ministers
   of the Gospel. When we understand that the earth is to be filled with
   the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea--and because we
   believe that the millennial reign of Christ will certainly begin at the
   time that God has appointed--we are persuaded that there are unnumbered
   millions yet to come to the Gospel Feast and, therefore, we still cry,
   "yet there is room!" At that great banquet there shall not be one seat
   that shall be empty at the last! God has made provision for just as
   many as will come and it shall be found that the provision is
   sufficient for all the guests who accept the King's invitation--that
   the great eternal decision of God was not frustrated and that even the
   perversity of man's wicked will, which keep him from coming to God,
   shall be made, somehow or other, to reflect honor on the great Giver of
   the feast! Not a chair shall be vacant at that feast and not one of the
   redeemed shall be missing when the role is called at that day! We have
   not yet reached that period, so we can still say, "yet there is room."

   Well, Sinner, as it is true that "yet there is room," we have a word of
   warning to say to you. There is room in the precious blood of Christ,
   there is room at the Gospel Feast, there is room in the Church on
   earth, there is room in Heaven--but if you will not occupy this room, I
   must solemnly tell you that there is room for you elsewhere! Alas,
   there is room in Hell!There may hardly be prisons enough for all the
   criminals on earth, but there is room for them in Hell! There are
   "nations that forget God." There are myriads that hate Him, there are
   millions more that neglect His great Salvation, but there is room for
   them all in Hell if they will not repent and believe the Gospel!
   Blasphemer, there is room in Hell for you! Despiser of God's Day and of
   God's Word, there is room in Hell for you! And for some of you it may
   be that there are only a few more weeks or days--and then you will
   enter upon your terrible heritage! Grow on, you tares, till you ripen,
   and then, when you are bound up in bundles to be burned, let the
   bundles be ever so big, there is room for them all in Hell! Proud
   boasters, you may speak what Jude calls, "great swelling words," now,
   declaring that you will fight the matter out with God, but you will
   find that in Hell there is room to humble you and room to destroy you
   there to all eternity! Is it not enough to make a man's heart break
   even to think of such a terrible doom? Then what will it be to have to
   endure it without any hope of release forever? I remind you again that
   some of you will be there before long unless you repent! Oh, by the
   living God, in whose name I speak to you, I do entreat you, if you love
   yourselves, consider these things! For if you will not have Christ as
   your Savior, you will have His wrath remaining upon you forever and
   ever! If the message of God is despised by you, how shall you escape if
   you neglect so great a Salvation? Sinner, are you resolved to make your
   bed in Hell? Soul, have you set your heart on it? Will you tonight give
   your hand to Satan and promise to be his slave forever? Stop, Man! This
   may be the last time that your conscience will ever be alarmed, so I
   plead with you to trust in Christ before I send you away to your homes.
   Think seven times before you do reject Him this once more, lest the
   slighted, grieved, almighty Spirit should depart from you and never
   strive with you again!

   My last thought which I pass on to every unconverted sinner, is
   this--as there is room in the blood of Christ, as there is room in
   Heaven, why not for me? Will not each sinner here also say, why not for
   me? Soul, what does God say to you tonight? "Believe on the Lord Jesus
   Christ and you shall be saved." So this is what you have to do--obey
   the gracious message and believe in Christ! To believe on Christ is to
   trust Him and I am sure that He deserves your trust. He is God, able to
   save you--and He is Man, willing to save you. He would not have died if
   He had not loved sinners. He stands pleading with you tonight, blessed
   be His name, and though it has been with stern words that He has spoken
   to your conscience, now He asks you to trust Him and He says that if
   you do, you shall be saved! Soul, will you trust Him now? I hope the
   Spirit of God will lead you to say, "Yes, I will trust Jesus tonight. I
   feel utterly unworthy, but then He died to save the unworthy. My heart
   is very hard, but I know that He can soften it. I do not feel my need
   of Him as I should feel it, but He did not tell me I was to feel my
   need and make that my qualification. He said, 'Let him that is thirsty,
   come. And whoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.' I will
   venture to come to Him while yet there is room."

   Perhaps the black doubt comes to you, "Is there room for me?" My answer
   to that question is this--you are com-mandedto believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ! It is impossible for you to do that and yet be lost! You
   shall find that there is room for you, room which no one but yourself
   can occupy, room in that Kingdom of which Christ says that it was
   ordained for you before the foundation of the world! Your business,
   Sinner, is to trust Christ just as you are, now, and just where you
   are! O my Hearers, you whose souls are committed to my trust, I feel
   that I must have your souls for my Master! He knows that I care for no
   wages but your immortal souls! He knows that if He denies me your
   souls, I shall feel that I have labored in vain and spent my strength
   for nothing. This year God has blessed the Word to many, many hearts!
   Hardly a day has passed without someone being blessed and not a sermon
   have I preached in this Tabernacle without hearing afterwards of
   conversions through it--and I sincerely trust that it may continue.
   Lord, speak to hearts that have resisted You until now! Sovereign
   Grace, there is nothing that can stand against You--Your goings forth
   are mighty and Irresistible! You speak, and it is done, You command and
   it stands fast forever! Speak, Lord, and Your servants shall hear and
   this night they shall say, "We will come unto You while yet there is
   room."

   May God grant that many shall come to Jesus this very moment, for His
   dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 14:7-24.

   Verse 7. And He put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when He
   marked how they chose out the chief rooms. This parable was by far the
   best part of the entertainment of the day!

   7-9. Saying unto them, When you are bidden of any man to a wedding, sit
   not down in the highest place lest a more honorable man than you is
   bidden of him; and he that bade you and him comes and says to you, Give
   this man place; and you begin with shame to take the lowest place. For,
   of course, the next room is full, and the next, and the only vacant
   seat, when the feast has begun, will probably be in the very lowest
   room of the house.

   10. But when you are bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place, that
   when he that bade you come, he may say unto you, Friend, go up higher
   Then shall you have worship in the presence of them that sit at the
   meal with you. Note that our Savior was not just then talking to His
   disciples, or else He would have given more spiritual reasons for His
   advice. But, speaking to the people who were gathered as guests at the
   Pharisee's house, He appealed to them with an argument suitable to
   themselves. We may, however, extract the marrow from this bone! Let us
   not covet the highest place. Let us not desire honor among men. In the
   Church of God the way upward is downward. He that will do the lowest
   work shall have the highest honor. Our Master washed His disciples'
   feet and we are never more honored than when we are permitted to
   imitate His example.

   11. For whoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles
   himself shall be exalted. There is a conspiracy of Heaven and earth and
   Hell to put down proud men, neither good nor bad--the highest nor the
   lowest can endure those who are self-exalted! But if you are willing to
   take your right place, which is probably the lowest, you shall soon
   find honor in the midst of your brethren!

   12. Then said He also to him that bade Him, When you make a dinner or a
   supper, call not your friends nor your brethren, neither your kinsmen,
   nor your rich neighbor lest they also bid you again, and a recompense
   is made you. Our Savior, you see, keeps to one line of instruction. It
   was a feast, so He used the feast to teach another lesson. It is always
   well, when men's minds are running in a certain direction, to make use
   of that particular current. When a feast is uppermost in the minds of
   men, it is no use starting another subject. So the Savior rides upon
   the back of the banquet, making it to be His steed! Note His advice to
   His host--"Try to avoid doing that for which you will be recompensed.
   If you are rewarded for it, the transaction is over. But if not, then
   it stands recorded in the Book of God and it will be recompensed to you
   in the Great Day of Account."

   13. 14. But when you make a feast, call thepoor, the maimed, the lame,
   the blind: andyou shall be blessed; for they cannot recompense you: for
   you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just It should be
   your ambition to have something set down to your credit "at the
   resurrection of the just." If you do someone a kindness with a view to
   gaining gratitude, you will probably be disappointed. And even if you
   should succeed, what is the gratitude worth? You have burned your
   firewood, you have seen the brief blaze, and there is an end of it. But
   if you get no present return for your holy charity, so much the better
   for you!

   15, 16. And when one of them that sat at the meal with Him heard these
   things, he said unto Him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the
   Kingdom of God. Then said He unto him. As if to prove what a privilege
   it is to be permitted to "eat bread," there, but that the persons who
   appear most likely to do so will never taste of it--and that the most
   unlikely persons will be brought into it. Jesus "said unto him."

   16, 17. A certain man made a great supper and bade many: and sent his
   servants at supper time to say to them that

   were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready. [See Sermon #1354,
   Volume 23--ALL THINGS ARE READY, COME.] They had accepted the
   invitation, so they were pledged to be present but, in the meantime,
   they had changed their minds with regard to their intended host--and
   they were unwilling to grace his feast.

   18. And they all with one consent began to make excuses. The first said
   unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must go and see it I
   pray you have me excused. Yet it was supper time and people do not
   generally go to see pieces of ground at night! And if the man had
   bought the land, he ought to have seen it before he bought it! People
   do not generally buy land without looking at it. A bad excuse is worse
   than none. [See Sermon #578, Volume 10--A bad excuse is worse than

   NONE.] and this is one of those excuses which will not hold water

   for a minute!

   19. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
   inspect them: I pray you have me excused. He pretended that he had
   bought five yoke of oxen without inspecting them and that he wanted to
   inspect them after he had bought them, when, of course, he could not
   cancel the bargain! A likely story! But, when men want to make an
   excuse, and they have no truth to serve as the raw material, they can
   always make one out of a lie!

   20. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot
   come. [See Sermon #2122, Volume 36--a straight talk.] This man did not
   ask to be excused--he had married a wife, so

   that settled the matter! Of course he could not go to the feast.

   21. So that servant came and told his lord these things. Every true
   servant of Christ should go to his Lord and tell him what reception his
   Master's message has had. After service, we sometimes have an
   enquirers' meeting, but after every sermon there ought to be a meeting
   of the servant with his Lord to tell the result of the errand on which
   he has been sent. Sometimes, as in this case, it will be a very painful
   meeting as the servant tells how his Master's message has been despised
   and His invitation rejected.

   21. Then the master of the house being angry. Notice what the Lord does
   even when He is angry--He invents some new way of showing mercy to men!
   "The master of the house being angry."

   21. Said to his servant, Go out quicklyinto thee streets andlanes
   ofthee city, and bring in theepoor, and thee maimed, and the halt, and
   the blind. Happy anger that explodes in blessing! The justly angry
   master turns away from the bidden ones who had insulted him and sends
   for those who had not hitherto been bidden, that they might come to the
   feast!

   22. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as you have commanded, and
   yet there is room. They fetched in all the poor people, the maimed, the
   halt and the blind whom they could find--it was a great gathering and a
   strange gathering--yet there was still room for more guests at the
   banquet!

   23. And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and
   hedges, and compel them to come in, that my

   house may be filled. [See Sermon #227, Volume 5--COMPEL THEM TO COME
   IN.] "Bring in highwaymen and hedge-birds, those that have no place
   where to lay their heads--fetch them in by force if necessary, 'that my
   house may be filled.'"

   24. For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall
   taste of my supper. They were invited, yet they would not come. But
   others shall come and fill the tables and the great feast shall be
   furnished with guests! No provisions of mercy will ever be wasted. If
   you who are the sons and daughters of godly parents, or you who are the
   regular hearers of the Word will not have Christ, then others shall! If
   you hear, but hear in vain, then the rank outsiders shall be brought in
   and they shall feed upon the blessed provisions of the Infinite Mercy
   of God and God shall be glorified! But terrible will be your doom when
   the great Giver of the Gospel Feast says concerning you and those like
   you, "None of those men which were bidden shall taste of My supper."

"The Lamb of God"

   (No. 3222)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 20, 1870.

   "Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world." John
   1:29.

   [Two other Sermons by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text are #1987, Volume
   33--"BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD" and #2646, Volume 45-- THE BAPTIST'S
   MESSAGE.]

   BEFORE we plunge into our main subject, it is necessary to notice what
   is implied in our text, which is that "the world" was lost through sin
   and that all mankind had become guilty before God. You, therefore, my
   dear Hearer, are one of those who are thus guilty. Though you may never
   have broken the laws of your country, nor even the rules of propriety.
   Though you may be both amiable and admirable in your general
   deportment, yet, for all this, as "there is none righteous, no, not
   one," you, also, are included among the unrighteous! It matters not
   what religious professions you may have made, or what outward forms of
   godliness you may have observed--unless you have a better righteousness
   than your own, you are a lost sinner! I believe there is now present a
   Brother who, when he was first convicted of sin, tried hard to make
   himself a better man under the mistaken idea that this was the way of
   salvation. And when, one Sabbath night, he heard me say that all the
   reforms you could ever make upon your old nature would be useless as to
   the matter of salvation, but that, "you must be born-again," he felt
   very angry and made a vow that he would never be found listening to me
   again! Yet here he is, rejoicing that the Lord has taught him to see
   himself as a lost, ruined sinner and to put his heart's trust in Jesus
   Christ, the sinner's Savior!

   It is very likely that if I had time to explain to you, my Hearer, the
   fullness of your sin and the utter ruin of your natural state, you,
   also, would grow angry. You would have no cause to be angry, for all
   that I could say would fall far short of the truth about your real
   condition in the sight of God! And it is most solemnly important for
   you to know that however high you may stand in the ranks of merely
   moral men, you are a lost soul and a condemned soul, as long as you
   remain without living faith in the Lord Jesus Christ! If you are angry
   with the minister of the Gospel who tells you this Truth of God, you
   are as foolish as a certain Brahmin whom I have heard of. His religion
   consisted chiefly in not eating any animal food or destroying any kind
   of life. The missionary told him that it was impossible for him to
   carry out such a "religion" as that, "for," he said, "in every drop of
   water that you drink, you swallow thousands of animals and so destroy
   vast quantities of animal life." Then he put a drop of water out of the
   cup from which the Brahmin had been drinking, under his microscope and
   so convinced him of the truth of what he had said. When the Brahmin saw
   the creatures moving in the water, instead of abandoning his false
   theory, he grew very angry and dashed the microscope upon the ground!
   He was not angry, you see, with the fact, but with that which revealed
   the fact/Like the lazy housemaid who said she was quite sure that she
   always kept the rooms clean but, it was the nasty sun that would shine
   in and make everything look so dusty! The fault is not in the Gospel
   which we preach--so you should not be angry with it, or with us-- the
   fault is in yourselves, in your own hearts and lives, and if you do not
   like to be told the truth about sin, it is a sure sign that your heart
   is not right in the sight of God! It is still true that "everyone that
   does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds
   should be reproved."

   Well then, with that Truth of God taken for granted--that you, whom I
   am now addressing, have sinned and are, therefore, under God's
   condemnation unless you are trusting in Christ--we now come directly to
   our text. We shall take it not merely as though John the Baptist were
   speaking it, but as we may now use it from our point of view. It
   appears to me to be the whole Gospel in a very brief form. You may
   sometimes write much in a very few words and here you have an epitome
   of the whole Gospel of God in these few syllables--"Behold the Lamb of
   God, which takes away the sin of the

   world." I am going to ask and try to answer three questions. First,
   what is to be beheld Secondly, what is to be done And thirdly, why
   should we do this

   I. First, then WHAT IS TO BE BEHELD?

   The text mentions a Lamb, by which is meant a sacrifice. Under the
   Jewish Law, those who had offended brought sacrifices and offered them
   to God. These sacrifices were representations of our Lord Jesus Christ
   who is, "the Lamb of God." Listen, my dear Hearer, and I will tell you
   the Gospel in a few sentences. As God is just, it is inevitable that
   sin should be punished. If He would pardon you, how can this be
   righteously accomplished? Only thus--Jesus Christ, His Son, came to
   earth and stood in the place of all those who believe on Him and God
   accepted Him as the substitutionary Sacrifice for all those who put
   their trust in Him. Under the Jewish Law, the lamb was put to death
   that the man might not be put to death and, in like manner, Jesus
   Christ, our Lord and Savior, suffered the pangs of death by crucifixion
   and the greater agony of the wrath of God that we might not suffer the
   pangs of Hell and the eternal wrath which is due to sin. There is no
   other way of salvation under Heaven but this! God cannot relax His
   Justice and He will by no means clear the guilty. But He laid upon
   Christ the full punishment that was due to sin and smote Him as though
   He had been the actual offender, and now, turning round to you, He
   tells you that if you trust in Jesus, the merits of His great atoning
   Sacrifice shall be imputed to you and you shall live forever in Glory
   because Jesus died upon the Cross of Calvary. If any of you would have
   your sins forgiven, and so enjoy peace with God, you must look by faith
   to that Sacrifice which was offered upon Calvary and keep your eyes of
   faith fixed there--and sooner or later you will certainly receive the
   blessings of peace into your souls!

   But the text not only mentions a Lamb, it says, "Behold the Lamb of
   God," and I draw your special attention to that expression. It is not
   merely a Sacrifice to which you are to look, but the Sacrifice that God
   has appointed and ordained to be the one and only Sacrifice for sin!
   This is an all-important point. "The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity
   of us all...It pleased the Lord to bruise Him, He has put Him to
   grief." If Christ had not been sent of God to be the Savior of sinners,
   our faith would have had no firm foundation to rest upon. But as God
   Himself has set forth Christ to be the Propitiation for human guilt,
   then He cannot reject the sinner who accepts that Propitiation! I need
   not raise any questions as to whether Christ's Atonement is sufficient,
   for God says that it is and as He is satisfied with the Sacrifice
   offered by His only-begotten and well-beloved Son, surely the most
   troubled conscience may be equally satisfied with it! Your offense, my
   Friend, was committed against God. If, then, God is content with what
   Christ has done on your behalf, and so is willing to pardon you, surely
   you need not enquire any further, but with gratitude you should at once
   accept the reconciliation which Christ has made! It is "the Lamb of
   God" whom I have to bid you, "behold." It is Jesus Christ, the Son of
   God, who died on Calvary, "the Just for the unjust, that He might bring
   us to God." It was God who appointed Him to die as the Substitute for
   sinners. It was God who accepted this Sacrifice when He died and now,
   Jehovah, Himself, speaking from His Throne of Glory, says to the
   sinner, "Believe on My Son whom I have set forth as the Propitiation
   for human sin. Trust in Him and you shall be eternally saved."

   Still further, to bring out the full force of the text, notice the next
   words, "Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world."
   When Jesus Christ was put into our place, our sin was laid upon Him and
   sin, like anything else, cannot be in two places at one time. If, then,
   I, being a Believer in Jesus, know that all my sin was laid upon
   Christ, it necessarily follows that I have no sin left upon me! It has
   become Christ's burden. He has taken it away from me. "Yes," you say,
   "but then the sin is still on Christ." Ah, but my Hearers, if our Lord
   Jesus Christ, "Himself bore our sins in His own body up on the tree,"
   He there endured all the punishment that was due to us, or an
   equivalent for it, and those sins were by that means put away--that is
   to say, they ceased to be--so they do not exist any longer! All my
   indebtedness to God was transferred to Christ and He paid all my debts!
   Then where are my debts now? Why, there are none! They are all gone
   forever. This is what Christ does for everyone who truly trusts in
   Him--He takes that man's sins absolutely out of existence so that they
   cease to be! Christ has accomplished the great work described to Daniel
   by the angel Gabriel--He has finished the transgression, made an end of
   sins--what a strong expression that is!--made reconciliation for
   iniquity and brought in everlasting righteousness! How gloriously He
   has put sin right away for all who believe in Him! "As far as the east
   is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us." Of
   all sinners in the whole world who believe in Jesus Christ, it may be
   truly said that all their sins are gone past all recall--God has cast
   them into the depths of the Red Sea of the Savior's blood and they
   shall not be remembered against them any more forever! It is thus that
   the Lamb of God takes or bears away sin!

   But whose sin does He take away?. The text says, "the sin of the
   world." By this expression I believe is intended the sin not only of
   the Jews, but of Jews and Gentiles, alike--the sin not only of a few
   sinners, but of all sinners in the whole

   world who come to Jesus and put their trust in Him! He has so taken
   away "the sin of the world" that every sinner in the world who will
   come to Him and trust in Him, shall have all his sins put away forever!
   Whether he is Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, Barbarian or
   Scythian, bond or free, if he truly believes in Jesus, it is certain
   that Christ took all his sins away. Whether he was born 1800 years ago,
   or whether he shall be born in the ages that are yet to come, does not
   make any difference to this fact--Christ has borne his sins if he
   trusts in Jesus as his own Savior. This is the sign and token by which
   he may assuredly know that he has a saving and eternal interest in the
   precious blood of Jesus--"He that believes on Him is not condemned."
   The gate of Divine Grace is set very wide open in our text--if it were
   not, some poor sinners would be afraid to enter! "Oh," asks one, "is
   this mercy for me? Is it for me?" Well, Friend, I will ask you a
   question--will you trust Christ? Will you come to Him this very moment
   and take the mercy that He freely presents to all who will accept it?
   If so, I am sure that it is yours--as sure as I am that it is mine!

   Possibly someone has come in here tonight hoping to hear something new,
   but I have nothing new to tell, nor do I wish ever to have anything
   more new than this--"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."
   Or this, "God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son
   that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life." When Dr. Judson went home to America from Burma, there was a
   large congregation gathered together and they requested the returned
   missionary, the veteran of so many years of service, to address the
   assembly. He stood up and simply told the story that I have again told
   you tonight--the story of Christ suffering in the place of sinners and
   of Christ saving all who trust Him. Then he sat down and one who sat
   next to him said to him, "I am afraid the friends are rather
   disappointed--they expected to hear something interesting from you." He
   said, "I have spoken to them to the best of my ability upon the most
   interesting subject in the whole world! What could I have done better
   than that?" "Yes," said the other, "but after having been so long
   abroad, they thought that you would tell them some interesting story.
   They did not think you would come all the way from Burma just to tell
   them only that." The missionary then rose and said, "I should like to
   go home feeling that although I have come all the way from Burma, I do
   not know anything that I can tell you that I think is half as good for
   you to hear, or half as interesting, as the story of the love of Christ
   in dying to save sinners."

   The good doctor was right and I feel just as he did--that there is
   nothing so interesting as the story of the Cross! You need to hear it,
   you who are already saved. And you need to hear it, you who are not yet
   saved! You musthear it, for there is no hope of salvation for you
   except as faith shall come to you by hearing--and especially hearing
   that portion of the Word of God which deals most closely with the Cross
   of Christ!

   One night, a dissolving-view lecture upon the Holy Land was being given
   and, as the audience, sitting in darkness, looked at a picture of
   Jerusalem, they were startled by a voice asking, "Where is Calvary?"
   Ah, and that is the question that many of you need to ask--"Where is
   Calvary?" There must you turn your eyes where, between the two thieves,
   your Savior died. If you really look to Him as He dies there for guilty
   sinners, you are saved! And then whatever else you do not know, you
   know enough to save you, for you are wise unto eternal life! May the
   Lord graciously make you thus wise through the effectual working of His
   ever-blessed Spirit! So then, God in human flesh, the
   Divinely-appointed Sacrifice for human guilt, "the Lamb of God," is
   what you are bid, in our text, to "behold."

   II. But now, secondly, WHAT ARE WE TO DO?

   How are we to have a part and lot in that great Sacrifice which Christ
   offered on Calvary? The answer of the text is, "Behold"--that is, look
   to " the Lamb of God"--

   "There is life in a look at the Crucified One!"

   "Behold the Lamb of God" means believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, trust
   in Him as your Savior, accept God's Revelation concerning Him and rely
   upon Him to save you. This is the way of salvation!

   Notice how opposed this is to the idea that we are critically to
   understand the Doctrines of the Gospel before we can be saved. How many
   persons there are who want to know this and to understand that! They
   come to us and say, "Here are two texts that do not seem, to us, to
   square with one another, and there are those two Doctrines of Divine
   Sovereignty and Human Responsibility which do not appear to be
   consistent with each other. Must we understand all the mysteries before
   we can be saved?" O foolish people! They remind me of one who is
   shipwrecked and who, as the lifeboat comes up to the sinking ship, or
   to the spar upon which he is floating, says to the captain, "Before I
   can get on board that lifeboat, I want to know the exact number of
   planks there are in it. And I really do not think that knowing that
   would content me--I would also like to know how many rivets and bolts
   there are in the boat. And I also need to know what is the theory of
   the operation of the oars upon the waves and how it is that boats are
   propelled." If a man ever did talk thus, I

   am pretty sure that the captain of the lifeboat would exclaim, "What a
   fool that man is! He is in danger of drowning, yet he talks like this!
   Come into the boat at once, or we must leave you to perish!" And I also
   feel that you unconverted sinners have no business to set yourselves up
   as critics of the Word of God! There is something much simpler than
   that for you to do--and the text bids you do it--"Behold the Lamb of
   God." Do not sit down to manufacture difficulties-- "believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." There are various ways of
   using a piece of bread. One man may take it and employ it in rubbing
   out the pencil marks which he has made upon a sheet of paper. Another
   man may take it to an analyst and ask him to see how much alum the
   baker may have put into it. But the really hungry man--the one who gets
   the most good out of the piece of bread--eats it! And that is what I
   recommend you to do with the Gos-pel--not begin to turn it about this
   way and that, not ask all manner of questions concerning it--but feed
   upon it! And the way to feed upon it is to accept it, believe it and
   especially to put your trust in Jesus Christ, who is the very Essence
   of the Gospel!

   "Behold the Lamb of God," says the text--then that command is opposed
   to the question that troubles so many-- whether they are elect or
   not!That is like wanting to read Hebrew before one has learned to speak
   English! Such people are not content to learn the A B C, the elements,
   the rudiments of the Gospel, first--they first want to know the
   Gospel's classics, or mathematics, or metaphysics--but that cannot be!
   During the recent hard frosts I have struck up an acquaintance with a
   little friend who, I am afraid, may desert me, by-and-by, but our
   friendship has been exceedingly pleasant to each of us thus far. On the
   little balcony outside my study windows, I observed a robin frequently
   coming, so I took an opportunity, one morning, to put some crumbs there
   and I have done the same thing every morning since. And my little
   feathered friend comes close up to the window frame and picks up the
   crumbs. And I do not perceive that he has any difficulty about whether
   the crumbs were laid there for him, or whether I had any electing love
   towards him in my heart. There were the crumbs--he needed them and he
   picked them up and ate them! And I can tell you that in doing so, he
   exactly fulfilled my purpose in putting the crumbs there! I thought
   that he acted very wisely and I think that if a poor sinner wants
   mercy--and he sees that there is mercy to be had--he had better not
   pause to ask, "Did God decree me to have it?" But go on and take it and
   he will then find that in doing so, he is fulfilling God's decree! My
   little robin friend is very wise in his way, for he has called a friend
   of his to join him at the feast on the balcony. How he did it, I do not
   know, but he managed to tell a blackbird all about the crumbs--and he
   brought him last Friday morning to see them for himself. The blackbird
   was rather shy at first, and stood for a while on the iron bar of the
   balcony. But after looking in at the study window, he happened down and
   neither he nor the robin asked whether it was my purpose that the
   blackbird should have any of the crumbs! But there were the crumbs and
   they were both hungry, so they came and fed together. So, if any of you
   find Jesus Christ for yourselves and you know some poor soul who needs
   Him, do not begin asking whether it is God's purpose or decree that he,
   also, should find the Savior--go and invite him to come to Jesus and
   then both of you come to the Savior together--and then, just as the
   robin and blackbird exactly fulfilled my purpose in throwing out the
   crumbs, so, when you and your friend come to Christ, you will rejoice
   to find that you have, both of you, fulfilled the eternal purpose of
   the Divine Decree of the great heart of God! It is not your business to
   look into the book of God's secret purposes, but to look to Christ, or,
   as our text puts it, to, "behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the
   sin of the world."

   Ah, but this beholding of the Lamb of God is a thing to which men
   cannot readily be brought! I know many whose consciences are truly
   awakened and who see themselves as sinners in the sight of God, but
   instead of beholding the Lamb of God, they are continually beholding
   themselves! I do not think that they have any confidence in their own
   righteousness, but they are afraid that they do not feel their guilt as
   much as they ought. They think that they are not yet sufficiently
   awakened, sufficiently humbled, sufficiently penitent and so on, and
   thus they fix their eyes upon themselves in the hope of getting peace
   with God! Suppose that yesterday or the day before, you had felt very
   cold and, therefore, you had gone outside your house and fixed your
   gaze upon the ice and the snow--do you think that sight would have
   warmed you? Now you know you would have been getting colder all the
   time! Suppose you are very poor and you studiously fix your mind's eye
   upon your empty pocket--do you think that will enrich you? Or imagine
   that you have had an accident and that one of your bones is broken--if
   you think very seriously of that broken bone, do you think that your
   consideration will mend it? Yet some sinners seem to imagine that
   salvation can come to them through their consideration of their lost
   and ruined condition! My dear unconverted Hearers, you are lost whether
   you know it or not! Take that fact for granted. If you would be saved,
   look not at yourselves, but "behold the Lamb of God." He has been sent
   by His Father to be the Savior of sinners and it is by trust in Him
   that peace and pardon will come to you! I pray you not to suppose, for
   a single moment that your repentance, your tears, or your softened
   heart can prepare you for Christ! Do not come to Chr-

   ist because you have a tender heart, but come to Christ to geta tender
   heart! Do not come to Him because you are fit to come, but because you
   need to be made fit! And remember that--

   "All the fitness He requires Is to feel your need of Him. This He gives
   you -'Tis the Spirit's rising beam!" Give up looking at yourself and
   "behold the Lamb of God."

   Let me also, dear Friend, warn you against the notion that your prayers
   can save you apart from beholding Christ I believe that it is both the
   duty and the privilege of every living soul to pray--but that the first
   command to a sinner is to pray, I deny! There first command is,
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ." And when you have done that, you
   will soon get to praying. I think it is stated in McCheyne's life, that
   after an earnest sermon, he found a man under deep concern of soul. And
   after saying a word or two to him, he said, "I cannot stay longer with
   you, myself, but there is one of my elders who will pray with you." The
   elder did so and he prayed in so fervent a fashion that it was remarked
   that he seemed to be like Jacob wrestling with the Angel until he
   prevailed. The man afterwards came to see Mr. McCheyne and said to him,
   "I am very thankful that I was at your Church that night. I feel very
   happy and I believe I am saved." "Well," said Mc-Cheyne, "what makes
   you feel so happy?" "Oh," he said, "I have great faith in that good
   man's prayers." McCheyne at once said, "My Friend, I am afraid that
   good man's prayers will ruin you! If that is where you are putting your
   confidence, you are utterly mistaken." He was quite right. And your own
   prayers will be just such an obstacle in your way if you trust to them
   instead of trusting to Christ! "I know I pray," says one, "and I am
   very earnest in prayer." Well, I am glad of that as far as it goes, but
   if you have not something better to trust to than your own prayers,
   your prayers will ruin you-- for the look of faith is not to be given
   to prayer, but to Christ! Our text says, "Behold the Lamb of God." I
   have told you what that means--look by faith to the Sacrifice that
   Christ made for sinners on the Cross at Calvary--but if you look to
   anything else for salvation, you will not find it! Even your prayers,
   apart from faith in Christ, will not save you from everlasting
   destruction! O Sinner, get away from everything else and come to
   Christ--

   "None but Jesus, none but Jesus, Can do helpless sinners good!" This
   great Truth of God, that believingis the Divinely-appointed means of
   salvation, may be illustrated by the old

   story of the children of Israel and the serpent of brass. [Other
   Sermons by Mr. Spurgeon upon this subject, are as follows--#153, Volume
   3--THE MYSTERIES OF THE BRONZE SERPENT; #285, Volume 5--MAN'S RUIN AND
   GOD'S REMEDY and #1500, Volume 25--NUMBER 1500--OR, LIFTING UP THE

   BRONZE SERPENT.] You have heard it scores of times, yet I beg you

   to listen to it once more! When the people were bitten by the fiery
   serpents in the wilderness, they were commanded to look at the serpent
   of brass that was lifted upon a pole--and whoever looked, lived. They
   had nothing to do but look! Moses lifted up the serpent and pointed to
   it and cried, "Look! Look! Look! And be healed." Possibly there were
   some who said they were bitten too badly to look. Well, if they could
   not or did not look, they would die. They might think it was a proof of
   their humility to say, "We are too sick to be cured," but if they did
   so, they would die whether they were humble or not! O my Hearer, do not
   be lost through a mock humility which is really abominable pride! You
   are not too great a sinner to be saved! I will venture to say that you
   will dishonor Christ if you ever think such a thing! So let not that
   sinful thought destroy you!

   There may have been others who said, "We shall not look to the bronze
   serpent for we have only got a mere scratch--it will soon be gone." But
   you know a poison scratch means death and if your sin were only a
   scratch (it is much more than that) it would mean eternal damnation for
   you! So look to Jesus, I implore you, just as you are! Look now! Look
   and live!

   Perhaps there was one who said, "My father had a famous recipe for
   serpent bites. It was given to him by a celebrated doctor in Egypt, so
   we will mix up the proper ingredients and so get cured." Well, if any
   who were bitten were to act and speak like that, they would all
   die--the deadly venom would certainly destroy them, whatever ointments
   they might use! A look at the bronze serpent gave life, but the refusal
   to look brought death.

   There may have been some fine gentlemen there who had imbibed skeptical
   notions during their life in Egypt. They were so clever that they
   thought they knew a great deal more than the Lord's servant to whom God
   had specially revealed the only effectual remedy, so they turned on
   their heels and said, "Such a remedy as this is utterly ridiculous! It
   is not according to the laws of physics that the mere looking at a
   piece of brass can heal people of the bites of snakes!" So they
   perished. Notwithstanding all their learning and wit, notwithstanding
   their jeers at the Divinely-appointed remedy,

   they perished. And nobody in the whole camp was healed except those who
   were simple enough and wise enough to take God at His word. Then,
   though they were terribly bitten, though their blood was set on fire by
   the poison and though some of them were in a truly desperate
   state--when they just looked at the bronze serpent--in a moment their
   blood again flowed healthily through their veins and their strength
   returned to them in all its former vigor! And, dear Friends, there
   shall be no soul saved in the whole world except by looking to the
   crucified Christ of Calvary! All trust in christening, (or even in
   Baptism), in confirmation, in sacraments, in ceremonies, in priests,
   popes and relics--are all lies--but as long as God's Word remains true,
   he who looks by faith to Christ, alone, must and shall be eternally
   saved! Oh, how can I utter this Truth of God so as to make it plainer,
   or how shall I plead with you so as to bring you all to trust in
   Christ? I cannot do this, but I pray the Holy Spirit to do it, for He
   can--and then you will believe in Jesus and so receive everlasting
   life!

   III. I must not detain you longer, as our time has fled. Otherwise I
   was to have answered a third question, WHY SHOULD WE THUS LOOK?

   The answer would have been that God has appointed this as the only way
   of salvation, that those who obey the command of the text will obtain
   immediate salvation and that, being saved, they shall have joy and
   peace in believing! But you who neglect or refuse to "behold the Lamb
   of God" must, without doubt, everlastingly perish! Of His infinite
   mercy, may God graciously grant that none whom I am now addressing may
   refuse to believe in Jesus, but may everyone look to Him and live--live
   now, and live forever!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 1:1-34.

   Verse 1. In the beginning was the Word. Christ the Word has existed
   from all eternity! He is the Eternal Son of the Eternal Father. He is
   really what Melchisedec was metaphorically, "having neither beginning
   of days, nor end of life." "In the beginning was the Word."

   I. And the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The Word was as
   truly God as the Father was God, and as the Spirit was God. "These
   Three are One," and have always been One. "Very God of very God" is
   that Jesus whom we trust, love and adore!

   2-5. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by
   Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was
   life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in
   darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not The light of Christ
   shone many times amid the darkness that enshrouded the world before His
   coming to live here in the flesh, yet comparatively few recognized that
   light and rejoiced in it. Christ's light shines more brightly now, but
   the dark, benighted soul of man perceives not the brightness of our
   spiritual Lord until the Holy Spirit works the mighty miracle of
   Regeneration and so gives sight to those who have been blind.

   6. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. What a descent
   it is from, "The Word of God," to the "man sent from God, whose name
   was John." Jesus Himself said concerning John, "Among them that are
   born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist."
   Yet, from the greatest of Prophets, what a climb it is to get up to
   Jesus Christ, the Son of God! "There was a man sent from God, whose
   name was John."

   7-9. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that
   all men through Him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent
   to bear witness of that Light That was the true Light, which lights
   every man that comes into the world.John could not do that--he could
   only bear witness to Christ, the true Light, who alone is able to
   illuminate, in a larger or lesser degree, "every man that comes into
   the world."

   10. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him and the world
   knew Him not Oh, what terrible estrangement sin has caused between God
   and man! What dreadful ignorance sin has created in the human mind! The
   world was made by Christ, yet "the world knew Him not."

   II. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not To those who
   were chosen as "His own" out of all the nations upon the earth, to
   those to whom He was especially promised of old, to the descendants of
   Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--to these Jesus came, yet they "received Him
   not."

   12. But--This is a blessed, "But." Though Christ's own nation, the
   Jews, as a whole "received Him not," there was "a remnant according to
   the election of Grace," there were some who received Him. "But"--

   12. As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons
   of God, even to them that believe on His name. How came those persons
   to receive Him when others rejected Him? There must have been some
   great change

   worked in them to make them different from the rest of their
   countrymen. And truly there was, for these were twice-born men--

   13. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
   the will of man, but of God [See Sermon #2259,

   Volume 38--THE SIMPLICITY AND SUBLIMITY OF SALVATION.] So that those

   who receive Christ, those who truly believe on Christ, are people who
   have been born, as others have notbeen born, by a new birth from
   Heaven--a supernatural birth, so that they are a people set apart by
   themselves as those who have been created twice--first as human beings
   just like others, and then as new creatures in Christ Jesus!

   14-18. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
   His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father), full of
   Grace and Truth. John bore witness of Him and cried, saying, This was
   He of whom I spoke, He that came after me ispreferred before me: for He
   was before me. And ofHis fullness have we all received, and

   THE TREASURY OF THE SAINTS--Read/download both sermons, free of charge,
   at http://www.spurgeongems.orgQ for the Law was given by Moses, but

   Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ No man has seen God at any time;
   the only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, He has
   declared Him.There is no way of knowing God and being reconciled to God
   except as we receive Jesus Christ, His Son, into our hearts and learn
   of Him all that He delights to reveal to us concerning His Father
   through the Holy Spirit's teaching.

   19-23. And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
   Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? And he confessed, and
   denied not but confessed, I am not the Christ. And they asked him, What
   then, Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you that Prophet? And
   he answered, No. Then said they unto him, who are you, that we may give
   an answer to them that sent us? What say you of yourself? He said, I am
   the voice--Not the Word, but "the voice" by which the Word was to be
   made known--"I am the voice"--

   23-27. Of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the
   lord, as said the Prophet Isaiah. And they which were sent were of the
   Pharisees. And they asked him, and said unto him, Why do you baptize,
   then, if you are not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that Prophet?
   John answered them saying, I baptize with water: but there stands One
   among you, whom you know not. He it is, who coming after me ispreferred
   before me, whose shoe laces I am not worthy to unloose.See the true
   humility of this faithful servant of Christ! He does not dream of
   putting His own name side by side with his Master's. The unloosing of
   shoe laces was work for a slave to do, but if we are privileged to
   perform this work for Christ, it will make us as kings before Him! To
   do anythingfor Christ--to have even a menial's place in His palace is
   better than being an emperor among men! May we have the portion of
   those who are not ashamed to unloose the laces of Christ's shoes!

   28-31. These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordon, where John
   was baptizing. The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him, and said,
   Behold the Lamb of God, which takes a way the sin of the world. This is
   He of whom I said, After me comes a Man which is preferred before me:
   for He was before me. And I knew Him not--"When first I saw

   Him"--

   31-34. But that He should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I
   come baptizing with water. And John bore record, saying, I saw the
   Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I
   knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said
   unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining
   on Him, the same is He which baptizes with the Holy Spirit. And I saw,
   and bare record that this is the Son of God. Since John's time, many
   others have borne similar testimony. We, also, have received Him and
   rejoice to say that He has baptized us with the Holy Spirit. All that
   John said of Him is true--and much more than John said is also true. He
   is the Lamb of God who has taken upon Himself the sin of all who
   believe in Him and, therefore, He is able to save unto the uttermost
   all that come unto God by Him. Oh, that all men would receive the
   testimony concerning Him which we find in this blessed Book--and which
   we delight to repeat in His name!

Salvation As It Is Now Received

   (No. 3223)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   23, 1872.

   "Whom having not seen, you love. Though now you do not see Him, yet
   believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls." 1
   Peter 1:8,9.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text is #698, Volume
   12--SEEING IS NOT BELIEVING, BUT BELIEVING IS SEEING.]

   We usually speak of the greater benefits of salvation as being in the
   future. We desire that we may be found in Christ in the day of His
   appearing and that we may have a share in His eternal Glory. But,
   Beloved, salvation is not altogether a thing of the future--it is very
   decidedly a present matter, a blessing to be possessed now and to be
   enjoyed now--and our text brings out that idea very clearly! Peter does
   not write about the elect strangers hoping to receive salvation,
   by-and-by, but putting it all in the present tense, he says, "Whom
   having not seen, you love. Though now...you rejoice... receiving the
   end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls." The perfection of
   salvation is reserved for the Second Coming of the Lord, for at present
   the body is mortal because of sin--it is subject to pain and it will
   die unless the Lord should first come and it will, for a while, lie in
   the grave. But at His appearing shall be a resurrection of the body and
   then body and soul reunited shall experience the fullness of salvation!
   In that respect, therefore, salvation still remains in part a matter
   for the future, yet with the true child of God, the essence of
   salvation is a thing of today. Even now we rejoice with unspeakable joy
   and full of glory, receiving the end of our faith, even the salvation
   of our souls!

   I am going to speak upon this matter in the following way. First, we
   will enquire, what part of salvation do we receive here and now?
   Secondly, how do we now receive salvationl And then, thirdly we will
   make the solemn enquiry for all here, Have we received salvation, and
   if so, how far have we gone in the reception of it?

   I. My first question is, WHAT PART OF SALVATION DO WE RECEIVE HERE AND
   NOW?

   My first answer to the question is that, in a certain sense, we already
   possess the whole of it, for all salvation is wrapped up in Christ and
   Christ is ours if we are truly believing in Him. He is this day our
   Savior and our All-in-All-- He is already "made unto us wisdom,
   righteousness, sanctification and redemption." There is nothing of
   salvation that is outside of Christ and, therefore, since Christ is
   ours, the whole of salvation is ours. It is ours by the grip of faith
   and the Grace of hope--that living hope which is sure of
   realization--that well-grounded hope which cannot be disappointed. Our
   expectation is of so vivid a character that it brings not only near to
   us, but into actual present possession, joys which as yet are not
   revealed! So again I say that, in a sense, it is true for us to say
   that we have received in faith and hope the salvation of our souls if
   we have truly believed in Jesus, for--

   "The moment a sinner believes, And trusts in his crucified God, His
   pardon at once he receives, Redemption in full through Christ's blood."

   But, secondly, if we are to answer the question distinctly and in
   detail, we should say that if we have really trusted in Jesus, we have
   so far received the salvation of our souls that we have, at this
   moment, the assurance of the perfect pardon of all our sins. Let me
   repeat those words--if we have really believed in Jesus, we have, at
   this moment, the assurance of the perfect pardon of all our sins! And I
   will venture to put it as strongly as this and to say that yonder
   white-robed spirits before the eternal Throne of God are not more clear
   of the guilt of sin before the bar of Infallible Justice than was the
   dying thief the very moment that he turned his eye in faith to Christ
   upon the Cross of Calvary--or than you are if you are now trusting to
   the same Savior, or than I am as now depending alone upon the blood and
   righteousness of Jesus

   Christ, my Lord and Savior! The pardon which God gives to Believers in
   Jesus is not a semi-pardon. It is not a putting away of some of their
   sins, or a putting them away for a time--it is a perfect putting away
   of their sins forever, a casting of them, once and for all, behind
   God's back into the depths of the sea so that they shall never be found
   again! Yes, they shall be so completely put away that they shall cease
   to be, according to that Divine declaration, "The iniquity of Israel
   shall be sought for, and there shall be none." Oh, what a glorious
   Truth of God is this, that although a poor tried child of God may feel
   the force of his inbred sin and have to continually struggle with
   it--and though he may, from day to day, be conscious of his many
   imperfections, yet before those Eyes that see everything, there is no
   spot to be seen upon the Believer in Christ--I mean no spot in this
   respect--that he can never be condemned or punished for his sin! His
   sin is finally and forever pardoned! God has blotted it out like a
   cloud that has been blown away and completely dispersed. Therefore let
   our spirits rejoice if we are truly trusting in Jesus! And oh, that
   some who have never done so before, would now look believingly unto
   Him! If they do thus look this moment, they shall obtain perfect pardon
   and so shall receive the end of their faith, even the salvation of
   their souls! I cannot help repeating that sweet verse of Kent's which I
   have often repeated to you, which sounds so strange, but which is, I
   believe, absolutely true--

   "Here's pardon for transgressions past, It matters not how black their
   cast. And, O my Soul, with wonder view, For sins to come, here's
   pardon, too."

   And next, Beloved, we have received the salvation of our souls in this
   sense, that the alienation of our hearts from God is now effectually
   removed. We are saved from that alienation and that is a very great
   part of salvation. Once our backs were turned towards God, but now our
   faces are turned towards Him. At one time we did not admire His
   Character, nor desire to imitate Him, nor wish for His friendship nor,
   perhaps, even so much as think of His existence, much less did we
   aspire to give Him honor! But now, having believed in Jesus, we have
   undergone a complete change! We are not yet what we ought to be--we are
   still a long way off what we expect to be one day--yet we do desire to
   be what we should be. We admire the Character of God even though we
   have to prostrate ourselves in the dust when we see how far our own
   character is from likeness to it, and the whole set and current of our
   desires is towards purity and holiness. If we could have our way, our
   way would not be a sinful one. If our will could be gratified, our will
   would be that God should have His will with us and that we should be in
   all things conformed to the Divine Will! All true Christians are
   conscious that it is so with them and this is a great part of
   salvation. Indeed, it is destruction to be alienated from God, and it
   is salvation to be reconciled to Him! It is destruction to anyone to be
   a lover of sin. The man who loves evil is a destroyed man--a man who is
   broken in pieces--that which should be the glory of his manhood is
   absent from him. But when he is brought to love God, the ruins are
   rebuilt! And though, as yet, every part of the renovated building may
   not be finished, the Divine Architect who drew the plans of it from
   eternity, will never leave the work till the last stroke of the sacred
   hammer and chisel shall have been given--and the completed structure
   shall have had the headstone placed upon it amid shouts of, "Grace,
   Grace unto it!" Blessed be God that we have this salvation, now, in
   that we are saved from our former alienation of heart from God!

   In the next place, we have received the salvation of our souls in the
   sense that we are saved from the killing power of sin. Before we
   believed in Jesus, we were not capable of those sacred actions which
   are now our daily delight. We could not pray. We may have "said our
   prayers," as so many do, but the living breath of true God-inspired
   prayer was not in us. How could it be in us while we were still dead in
   trespasses and sins? We could not believe. How could we do so when we
   had not received the gift of faith from the ever-blessed Spirit? The
   fact is, we were under a terrible bondage and just as a corpse is under
   bondage to death and cannot stir hand or foot, lip or eye, so were we
   under bondage to sin and Satan. But we are under that deadly bondage no
   longer, for we are living men, free men in Christ Jesus our Lord who
   has overcome that death for us! Now we can pray! Now we can praise--not
   always as we would like to do, but still, the aspiration is there and
   the power is there--and when God graciously helps us by His Holy
   Spirit, we rise to a high degree of vigor in both those sacred
   exercises! So, when the killing power of sin is gone, what a mercy it
   is! What a bliss it is! And in this sense, also, we receive the
   salvation of our souls.

   More than that, Beloved, the reigning power of sin has now gone from
   every Believer Once we were slaves to sin, under sin's domination. Sin
   said to us, "Go," and we went, or sin said to us, "Stay! Obey not God,"
   and we stayed and at sin's bidding disobeyed God. But now, sin no
   longer has dominion over us, for we are not under the Law, but under
   Grace. And though we even now sometimes hear sin's mandate and the
   flesh inclines us to yield obedience to it, there is a

   blessed spirit of rebellion against sin within our heart so that we
   will not obey sin's commands, but seek after that which is just and
   holy and right in the sight of God!

   Now I am going to take another step and possibly some of the feebler
   folk among us may think it is too long a step for them to take. Yet I
   pray God that many of us may practically prove that we have taken it.
   Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, it is possible and it ought to
   be the general rule for Christians to enjoy present salvation in the
   sense of being now free, to a very high degree, from sin in their daily
   life and conduct No, more--they ought not to be satisfied without
   aspiring to be absolutely free from it! It is after this that they
   should seek, even though they do not attain to it. I am fully persuaded
   the perfection in the flesh is not attainable here, yet that Truth of
   God, as I believe it is, has been used by a great many persons as a
   sort of damper to the sad ambition of renewed spirits! I do not think
   it ought to be so used, nor that it would legitimately be so used.
   Suppose I am a sculptor? If it is not possible for me to attain to the
   perfection of Praxiteles or Phidias, yet I must come as close to them
   as I can--and I shall not be a master of the sculptor's art unless I
   seek to imitate those who have been the most proficient in it. Suppose,
   also, that through the infirmity of the flesh, I shall never in this
   life be perfect, like Christ--yet I must have no lower model, nor must
   I say to myself, "I cannot imitate that perfect Model," but, crying to
   the Strong One for strength, I must believe that the Omnipotence of God
   can overcome every sin! And I must also believe that it is possible for
   me, by the Grace of God, to get every sin beneath my feet. And I must
   never say to any one sin, "I shall have to spare you, for you are too
   strong for God to slay." It would be blasphemy to talk like that!

   I fear that some Brothers and Sisters think that a quick temper can
   never be overcome. But it must be overcome! The reason why so many
   professors so often fall into that sin is that they do not believe that
   it is conquerable and, therefore, they do not pray it down! Another
   person, perhaps, has a sluggish disposition and he thinks, "I must
   always be so. It is my nature and the flesh is weak." It is true that
   the flesh is weak, but it is equally true that God is Almighty! And it
   is not our own strength but Divine strength that is to procure the
   deliverance of our soul from sluggishness! So we must cry mightily unto
   the Lord for Divine Grace to overcome this or any other sin to which we
   are peculiarly prone. God has not put us into Canaan and said to us,
   "You may spare some of those Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites,
   Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites!" His command to us is,
   "Slay them all! Let not one of them escape!" There must be no sin
   tolerated in any Believer in Christ! And though you are not perfect,
   you must never say, "Up to this point, I am perfect, and that is as far
   as God can make me perfect." Dear Friends, do you believe in an
   Infinitely powerful God? Do you believe that the Holy Spirit is able to
   work in you anything and everything that He wills to work? Then,
   Brothers and Sisters, stop not short of the highest point that is
   attainable by mortal men and seek to be "holy as God is holy!" Alas,
   some professors of religion are hardly even moral! Their pretended
   Christianity is a stench even in the nostrils of worldlings, for they
   do not conform to the common rules of ordinary decent society--and what
   true Christians long for is to possess real holiness, to walk with God
   as Enoch did, to abide in Christ, to shun every false way, to have--

   "A heart from sin set free"--

   and a conscience tender as the apple of the eye! Oh, that we could all
   come up to this standard! And we can! It is possible! This is
   attainable, by the Grace of God, through the effectual working of the
   Holy Spirit. I again say that I do not think that absolute
   perfectioncan be reached here, but I cannot tell how near we can come
   to it. That I would like to prove by happy personal experience--and I
   beseech every Brother and Sister in Christ here to join with me in
   seeking to know how we may, even now, receive the salvation of our
   souls from the power of sin!

   I am quite sure that there are many Christians who have been completely
   delivered from sins into which they readily fell in their early days.
   You know that infants suffer from a great many diseases. All through
   the period of babyhood, they are liable to various ailments which no
   longer afflict us who are grown-up men and women. So it is with some
   Christians--when they have grown in Grace to the stature of men in
   Christ, they do not have the little complaints of babyhood. I do not
   say that this is true of all professors of Christianity, for alas,
   there are many of them who have to be wheeled about in baby carriages
   although they are 50 or 60 years of age! While they were little
   children, we had to dandle them on our knees and carry them in our arms
   and give them milk--and they still want milk, and still want dandling
   now that they are getting gray--gray-bearded babies! But we need to get
   them out of that state of babyhood, for there is something far better
   even on earth than being spiritually mere babes all our lives! May all
   of us who are in Christ grow to the stature of men and women in Christ!
   The more of such any Church shall have among her members, the better
   will it be for her and the more will God be glorified! Let us who are
   the Lord's, resolve that everything that is to be had of God this side
   of Heaven, we will have! Let us not be content to get just inside
   Christ's house and to sit down there and say,

   "Thank God, we are safe. We have got over the threshold," but let us
   seek to press onward to the chief table of rich refreshment and inner
   fellowship with Christ and to know the secret of the Lord which is with
   them that fear Him, that so we may find that "glory begun below" of
   which Dr. Watts so truly sings--

   "The men of Grace have found

   Glory begun below!

   Celestial fruits on earthly ground

   From faith and hope may grow." II. And now, secondly, (and with greater
   brevity, not professing to dive into the depths of the text, but merely
   skimming its surface, as the swallow touches the brook with its
   wing)--HOW DO WE NOW RECEIVE THE SALVATION OF OUR SOULS?

   First, it is entirely from Jesus Christ--" Whom having not seen, you
   love, in whom, though now you see Him not, yet believing, you rejoice
   with joy unspeakable and full of glory: receiving the end of your
   faith, even the salvation of your souls." Everything of salvation that
   a Believer receives, comes to him out of the one storehouse wherein all
   fullness abides--that is in Christ Jesus! Never believe, Christian,
   that you will ever get any Divine Grace out of yourself! It is a dreary
   and useless task to send the bucket down into the dry well of our
   nature in the hope of drawing up a supply of Grace. Oh no, Beloved,
   look away from self and look alone to Jesus, for from Him, and from
   Him, only, do we receive the salvation of our souls!

   Then note that the channels through which we receive salvation from
   Christ are first, faith--"in whom, though now you see Him not, yet
   believing, you rejoice." None of us have seen Christ. We sometimes
   foolishly wish that we had, but believing in Him is better than merely
   seeing Him--for many saw Him when He was upon the earth--and yet
   perished! But no man ever truly believed in Him and then perished.
   Faith is that eye which savingly sees Christ on the Cross. And it is
   only as we continue to look to Him by faith that we receive the present
   salvation of our souls from sin. You can never kill any sin if you turn
   your eyes away from the Cross. There is no stream that can cleanse from
   inward lusts but the precious blood of Jesus that flowed on Calvary.
   Whoever has been victorious over any temptation, it may truly be said
   of him, "he overcame through the blood of the Lamb." So that there is
   no way of receiving the blessings of a present salvation except through
   believing in Jesus!

   Our text also tells us that another channel of salvation is love--"Whom
   having not seen, you love." The love of Christ is the great force that
   enables Grace to kill sin! The love of Christ and sin are like the two
   balances of a pair of scales--if sin goes up in our esteem, our love to
   Christ is going down! And whenever our love to Christ goes up, sin must
   go down in the same proportion. With little love to Christ, you will
   walk unwarily, but with great love to your Lord, you will walk
   carefully before Him and your practical holiness will become manifest
   to all around you. Though we have not seen Christ, we love Him! And
   through that love we receive a further assurance of the salvation of
   our souls from inward as well as outward sin. This is the precious
   golden conduit through which the power of Divine Grace flows freely
   into our souls. Oh, for more fervent love to Christ!

   Then our text stays that we also receive this present assurance of
   salvation through joy in the Lord--"In whom...believing, you rejoice
   with joy unspeakable and full of glory." This joy is a flaming sword
   like that which the cherubim waved at the gates of the Garden of Eden!
   It blazes, it cuts, it kills. Once let us really rejoice in Christ as
   our Savior and we become immediately guarded from sin. I believe that
   many sins are hatched beneath the wings of doubt and fear, but when we
   get away from those ugly things and live rejoicing in God, then we say,
   "Down with sin! We cannot endure to have it in our lives." He who has
   sweet flowers in his hand flings away evil-smelling weeds! And he who
   has such a diamond of Heaven as "joy unspeakable and full of glory"
   casts away the pebbles of earth with which He was pleased before. He
   who rejoices with joy unspeakable is not likely to be allured by the
   paltry joys of earth--they have lost all their former charm to him.
   Their siren songs have no attraction to his ears for he has heard the
   celestial note of the harps of Heaven! What bliss it is to be able to
   rejoice in Christ as our Savior, for this guarantees to us the
   salvation of our souls, not only now, but to all eternity!

   Why does the Apostle say that we rejoice with joy unspeakable?. Is it
   not, first, because this joy is too great to be told? He is indeed rich
   who cannot count his wealth. He has so much that he does not know how
   much he has and he is indeed full ofjoy who has so much joy that he
   cannot tell anyone how much he has!

   I also think that Peter calls our joy, "unspeakable," because if we
   were to try to explain or describe it to carnal men, they could not
   understand us. You cannot explain to a person who has never tasted
   honey, how sweet it is. Neither can

   you explain to a man who knows not the joy of the Lord, how joyous a
   thing it is. He could not comprehend what your words meant--you would
   be talking to him in an altogether unknown tongue!

   Moreover, Brothers and Sisters, you all know the old proverb, "Still
   waters run deep." The worldling joy barely covers the stones of his
   daily sorrow and, therefore, it babbles like a shallow brook as it runs
   along in its narrow bed. But the Christian's joy is broad and deep and
   it scarcely makes any sound as it majestically rolls on like some great
   river on its way to the sea! The Christians joy is unspeakable because
   it is unfathomable even by those who enjoy it! And wherever this joy
   comes, it has a purifying effect, delivering us from sin and making us
   thus receive the salvation of our souls.

   This joy is also said to be "full of glory." Now, the joys of this
   world have no true glory in them. Look at the worldly man who is most
   joyous and glad--what glory is there about him? Any so-called joy that
   comes through sin is just the opposite of glorious! The drunk's joy
   puts him below the level of beasts. But there is an elevating power
   about the Christian's joy--the joy of salvation, the joy of adoration,
   the joy of gratitude, the joy of love to God, the joy of being made
   like Christ, the joy of expecting His coming--all this is glorious joy
   and it is "full of glory!" I saw lately a picture representing the
   Coming Man, the Lord Jesus Christ. It represented Him as having in His
   hands cannons, triumphant arches, flags, kings, emperors and all the
   insignia of royalty--and blowing them away as chaff is driven before
   the wind! Come, O blessed Coming Man! You know how we need You! Well,
   He will come at the right time--and all the glory of this world will
   fly away just like that when He comes! But our joy is full of a glory
   which the Coming Man who is, "over all God, blessed forever," will keep
   on increasing so that it shall be to us the more full of glory forever
   and ever! Such joy as this glorious joy is, makes us look down upon the
   world's joys and sin's joys as utterly despicable! And so, by lifting
   us up above them, it further enables us to receive, here and now, the
   salvation of our souls!

   III. There was much more that I wanted to say, but my time has almost
   gone. In the good old Puritan times, they had an hourglass on the
   pulpit and when the sands were running out, the minister was warned
   that it was time to stop. But he often turned it over, again, and went
   on for another hour! I cannot do that, so I must hasten to a close with
   the

   solemn enquiry, HAVE WE RECEIVED THE SALVATION OF OUR SOULS? AND IF SO,
   HOW FAR HAVE WE

   GONE IN THE RECEPTION OF IT?

   The first and most vital question for you, my Hearers, is this--have
   you received the salvation of your souls I know that you have heard
   about salvation and many of you know what the Bible says about it. But
   that is not enough. "I know what salvation means," says one, "I know
   the way." Then take heed that you do not perish in the light! If two
   men have to go out in the dark, which is the one to whom the darkness
   is the more dense? Why, the one who has been sitting in the light! If
   you go out of your brilliantly illuminated room, you realize how dark
   it is outside where there is no light above or below. Take care, you
   who are sitting in the Light of God today, lest for you there should be
   "reserved the blackness of darkness forever" because you shut your eyes
   to the Light and will not receive the salvation of your souls.

   "Ah, but," say some, "we profess to be saved." I am glad to hear that
   and I would not even hint that your profession is not sincere, but I
   would urge you to hint to yourself that there is a possibility that all
   may not be well with you! Are there not many who think they have
   received the salvation of their souls, but who have not really done so?
   In St. Peter's, at Rome, I saw monuments to James III, Charles III, and
   Henry IX--kings of England--but these potentates were quite unknown to
   me! Certainly they never reigned in this land, so the royal names upon
   their monuments are only a subject for ridicule and scorn! And you
   profess and call yourselves Christians? If you really are so, it is
   well, but if you are not so, I can conceive that in the next world
   there may be spirits that shall say to you, "You professed to be
   Christians, yet you are in Hell! You sat at the Lord's Table and ate
   the bread and drank the wine in memory of His death--that death in
   which you had no saving interest--the Atonement that never redeemed
   you!" O no, my Hearers, may this never be true of any of us! But may
   God, in His Infinite Mercy, save us and so may we really and truly
   receive, and not merely profess to have received the salvation of our
   souls! If we have really cast ourselves upon Christ, though we have not
   seen Him--if we do truly love Him and if we have, to some extent, at
   least, the joy unspeakable and full of glory within our hearts-- then,
   indeed, we have received the salvation of our souls!

   Then comes the other question, how far have we received this salvation?
   If we had a sacred thermometer given to us in order to measure our
   spiritual heat, what would our temperature be? Are you, Brother, above
   freezing? I fear that some here are below zero! Have any of you come up
   to anything like blood heat yet? What a wondrous heat of love that must
   have been when the lifeblood of Jesus flowed from His wounds as He hung
   upon the Cross of Calvary! Oh, that we could always have our religion
   at such blood heat! Have we reached that spiritual temperature yet?
   There have been saints--and there are still saints willing to suffer
   the loss of all things for Christ's sake. Nothing has been too hot, too
   hard, or too heavy for them to endure in His blessed service. They have
   counted shame and loss to be honor and gain if they might but "glorify
   God and enjoy Him forever." Have we come anywhere near to them? We do
   have occasional communion with Christ, but have we abiding fellowship
   with Him? Do we dwell near to Christ?

   But what about these who have not yet believed in Him? I heard an
   evangelist say one night in this Tabernacle, "He that believes on the
   Son has everlasting life. H--A--S--that spells, 'got it.'" That is an
   odd way of spelling, but it is sound divinity! The Lord enable you all
   to believe in Jesus! Then you will have "got it," as our friend said.
   Or, as Peter, writing under the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit wrote,
   "Believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
   receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 PETER 1.

   Verse 1. Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ It must have been very
   pleasant to his heart to write those words--not "Peter, who denied his
   Master." Not, "Peter, full of imperfections and infirmities--the
   impetuous and changeable one of the twelve," but, "Peter, an Apostle of
   Jesus Christ," as truly sent of God as any of the other Apostles and
   with as much of the Spirit of his Master resting upon him! "Peter, an
   Apostle of Jesus Christ"--

   1, 2. To the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia,
   Cappadocia, Asia andBithynia, elect according to the foreknowledge of
   God the Father You might go for 50 years to some places of worship and
   never hear the word, "elect," ever mentioned! Modern ministers seem to
   be ashamed of the grand old Doctrine of Election, but it was not so
   with the Apostles and the early Christians! They were accustomed to
   speak of one another as the elect of God. The Doctrine of Election was
   most precious to their hearts and, therefore, Peter writes, "elect
   according to the foreknowledge of God the

   Father"--

   2. Through sanctifcation of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling
   of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
   We not only need Grace, but we need much Grace! And also peace. And we
   need a greatly increased measure of both those blessings. Do not be
   satisfied, dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, with the Grace that you
   already have. Be thankful for it, but ask for the Divine multiplication
   of it--regard the Grace which you have already received as being like
   the boy's loaves and fishes--and expect that Christ will continue to
   multiply it for you and for thousands of others round about you! "Grace
   unto you, and peace, be multiplied."

   3-5. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
   according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively
   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an
   inheritance incorruptible, and unde-filed, and that fades not away,
   reserved in Heaven for you who are kept by thepower of God through
   faith unto salvation

   ready to be revealed in the last time. [See Sermon #948, Volume 16--A
   STRING OF PEARLS.] What a vast mass of meaning is packed away in these
   words! Men's books, even when they are good, are like gold-leaf--a
   little precious metal is very thinly hammered out so as to cover a wide
   surface--but almost every Word in the Bible seems to contain a whole
   mine of heavenly wealth! Note, Beloved, what Peter says concerning your
   new birth--you are begotten by the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ! At your first birth, you were born in sin. But now you have
   been born-again, through Grace, by the almighty power of God! Notice,
   also, unto what you are born--unto a hope that is full of life, a
   lively hope, a hope of immortality, a hope whose root is in the grave
   of Christ, the empty grave from which He has risen and which is the
   assurance that because He has risen, you also shall rise. See, further,
   to what you have been born--"to an inheritance incorruptible, and
   undefiled, and that fades not away." See, also, how that inheritance is
   entailed upon you, for it is "reserved in Heaven for you." And see,
   too, how you are kept for it, for you "are kept by the power of God
   through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."

   6. Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if necessary,
   you are in heaviness through manifold temptations [See Sermon #222,
   Volume 4--THE CHRISTIAN'S HEAVINESS AND REJOICING.] What? Can there be
   rejoicing and heaviness in the same heart at the same time? Oh, yes!
   Our experience has taught us that we can be at the same moment in
   heaviness of heart and yet rejoicing in the Lord!

   7-9. That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of
   gold that perishes, though it is tried with fire, might be found unto
   praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: whom
   having not seen, you love; in whom though now you see Him not, yet
   belie ving, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
   receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.You
   have that already if you have believed in Jesus! You have received a

   present, immediate salvation! There are some who do not understand or
   realize this. They miss the whole joy of our holy religion. They are
   always hoping to be saved, by-and-by, but those who are in Christ Jesus
   by a living personal faith, receive here and now the end of their
   faith, even the salvation of their souls!

   10-12. Of which salvation the Prophets have enquired and searched
   diligently, who prophesied of the Grace that should come unto you:
   searching what or what manner of the time the Spirit of Christ which
   was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of
   Christ, and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed,
   that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things
   which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel
   unto you with the Holy Spirit sent down from Heaven; which things the
   angels desire to look into.

   [See Sermons #1524, Volume 26--YOUR PERSONAL SALVATION and #2697,
   Volume 46--ANGELIC INTEREST IN THE GOSPEL.] Observe, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, that the Prophets did not speak without due consideration, but
   they "enquired and searched diligently" into the meaning of that
   salvation of which they "testified beforehand." Holy Scripture must not
   be read by us carelessly. We ought to peer, pry and search into it to
   get at its hidden meaning. And the prophecies as well as the rest of
   the Word are to be searched into by us upon whom the ends of the earth
   have come. Observe, also, that this Divine Revelation is of great
   interest to the holy angels before the Throne of God--they stand gazing
   down as if they were trying to understand the wondrous mystery of
   Redemption and the great and glorious Gospel of the Grace of God.

   13-16. Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to
   the end for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the Revelation
   of Jesus Christ; as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves
   according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He which has
   called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;
   because it is written, be you holy; for I Am holy. Be not only moral,
   upright, truthful and so forth, but, "be you holy." That is a very high
   attainment! "Be you holy" and observe the reason for obedience to the
   command--"for I Am holy." Children should be like their fathers. There
   are many children who bear in their very faces, evidence of their
   sonship. You know who their fathers were by the image that the children
   bear. Oh, that it were always so with all the children of God! "Be you
   holy; for I Am holy."

   17. And if you call on the Father, who without respect of person judges
   according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in
   fear. You are only here for a while. You are sojourners, foreigners,
   pilgrims passing through a country where you have no abiding place. Be,
   therefore, careful and even fearful lest you should become like the
   people among whom you dwell! Have a holy dread of the contaminations of
   sin--"Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear."

   18-21. Forasmuch as you know that you were not redeemed with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
   received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of
   Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was
   foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in
   these last times for you, who by Him do believe in God, that raised Him
   up from the dead, and gave Him glory; that your faith and hope might be
   in God. What a well of joy this always was to Peter, that God had
   raised His Son, Jesus Christ, from the dead! And this is our joy today!
   This is one of the facts which are proved beyond all question, that
   Jesus Christ, who died upon the Cross and was buried in Joseph's tomb,
   did actually rise again! This is the cornerstone of the Christian
   faith-- one of the great facts upon which we found our confidence as to
   salvation by Jesus Christ.

   22, 23. Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth
   through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that you
   love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born-again, not of
   corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which lives
   and abides forever. God's Word never dies! God's Word never changes!
   There are some who think we ought to get a new Gospel every few years
   or even every few weeks--but that was not Peter's notion. He wrote and
   he was Divinely Inspired to write concerning "the Word of God, which
   lives and abides forever."

   24, 25. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the
   flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower thereof falls away:
   but the Word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the Word which by
   the Gospel is preached unto

   you. [See Sermon #999, Volume 17--THE WITHERING WORK OF THE SPIRIT.]

"Repentance and Remission"

   (No. 3224)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   17, 1870.

   "And that repentance and remission of sins should bepreached in His
   name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." Luke 24:47.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same text is #1729, Volume
   29--BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.]

   THIS verse is among our Lord's last words to His disciples just before
   He left them to return to Heaven. He wished to impress upon them the
   Truth of God that it was His purpose and desire that their lives should
   be devoted to the preaching of His Gospel among all nations upon the
   face of the earth. In Christ's own words and throughout the New
   Testament, we find the greatest stress laid upon preaching. Preaching
   is the great battering ram that is to shake the gates of Hell!
   Preaching is God's chief method of winning souls unto Himself--"for
   after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it
   pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
   We cannot too often remind this age in which we live of this Truth, for
   this is a time in which it is supposed that rites and ceremonies, human
   learning and literature and I know not what else, may very properly be
   allowed to supplant the preaching of the Word! Yet our Lord has given
   no intimation of any change in His purpose and plan--on the contrary,
   His great commission is evidently intended to cover the whole of this
   present dispensation--"Go you, therefore, and teach (that is, make
   disciples of) all nations, baptizing them (that is, those who have been
   made disciples) in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
   Holy Spirit; teaching them to observe all things whatever I have
   commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
   world (or, more properly, unto the end of the age). Amen." So, until
   this dispensation is brought to a close by the personal return of the
   Lord Jesus Christ, "repentance and remission of sins" are to "be
   preached in His name among all nations." Blessed, indeed, are those
   who, in this land or anywhere else, have heard their Lord and Master
   say to them as He said to His disciples before He left them, "and you
   are witnesses of these things."

   As I have been called, by His Grace, to be one of His witnesses, I will
   now try to put the text to practical use by preaching, first, upon the
   subject, and secondly, upon the audience here mentioned by our Lord.

   I. First, let us consider THE SUBJECT OF OUR PREACHING as here stated
   by our Lord--"that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
   in His name."

   So the first part of the subject is that repentance should he preached
   in the name of Jesus. There is a very important point that must here be
   noted--and that is that repentance is not to be preached in the name of
   Moses as a legal duty. Undoubtedly, it is a legal duty, for everyone
   who sins against God ought to repent of doing so. Whenever we have
   broken any Law of God, we ought to be sorry for having broken it. It is
   the natural, commonsense duty of the creature, when he has disobeyed
   any command of his Creator, to grieve that he has thus grossly offended
   his Maker and to resolve that if possible, he will not do so any more.
   But it is not in this fashion, simply as a legal duty, that Christ has
   bid His servants preach repentance. If we preach it thus, our labor
   will be in vain--at least to a very large extent!

   Nor are we to preach it merely as a matter of faint hope. There is,
   indeed, more than a faint hope for any man who is bid to repent because
   he will suppose, naturally and properly, that the God who bids him
   repent must have some designs of love towards him. But we are not to
   preach to sinners in such a fashion as simply to make them faintly hope
   that they may be saved. You know that when Jonah passed through the
   streets of Nineveh, his mournful and monotonous message was, "Yet forty
   days and Nineveh shall be overthrown." When that message was carried to
   the king, he laid aside his gorgeous robe and put on sackcloth, sat in
   ashes, proclaimed a fast for man and beast and commanded his people to
   turn from their evil ways! Yet he had no better hope than this--"Who
   can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce
   anger, that we perish not?" When they repented, God didhave mercy upon
   them and spared them. But we

   have to carry to sinners a far more hopeful message than that heathen
   king's enquiry, "Who can tell if God will turn and repent?" Our Lord
   Jesus Christ has ordained that repentance should be preached in quite a
   different fashion than that!

   We are not even to preach it after the manner of John the Baptistwho
   preached repentance as a preparation for the coming of Christ. His
   message was, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." To the
   Pharisees and Sadducees who came to his baptism, he said, "Bring forth,
   therefore, fruits meet for repentance," evidences of a change of life,
   because there was One far mightier than he coming after him--whose
   shoes he was not worthy to bear. John was only sent to prepare the way
   for Him who should baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire. There
   are some, nowadays, who seem to think that repentance is a sort of
   preparation for faith in Christ, but that is not as we understand the
   Word of God-- as we will try to show you before we have finished our
   discourse. We have not to preach repentance after the manner or in the
   nature of Moses, or Jonah, or John the Baptist--we have to preach
   repentance in the name of Jesus Christ! What does this mean?

   First, it means that we are to preach repentance as the gift of God.
   Christ was exalted with His Father's right hand, to be a Prince and a
   Savior, "to give repentance" as well as "forgiveness of sins." Wherever
   there is real sorrow for sin, wherever there is an honest
   determination, by God's Grace, to cease from sin, wherever there is a
   complete change of mind with regard to sin--for that is what repentance
   means--that repentance has been produced by the Spirit of God and it is
   as much a gift of the Covenant of Grace as even the pardon which comes
   with it is! This is the repentance which we are to preach in Christ's
   name, and of which Joseph Hart so sweetly sings--

   "Come, you needy, come and welcome,

   God's free bounty glorify!

   True belief and true repentance,

   Every Grace that brings us near,

   Without money,

   Come to Jesus Christ and buy!"

   You are not to seek to draw up repentance from the depths of your own
   heart, as you might draw up water from a well, but to ask Christ to
   work repentance in you by His Holy Spirit, through belief of the Truth
   of God as it is recorded in the Word of God, or as it is set before you
   in the preaching of the Gospel. As you learn how terribly Christ
   suffered because of sin, that Truth will, under the guidance of the
   Spirit of God, be the means of leading you to hate sin. And you will
   realize how the Holy Spirit, by enlightening the understanding and
   influencing the affections, produces repentance even in that sterile
   heart which had never been previously softened and made fertile by the
   gentle dew and rain of Grace. So we are to tell sinners that God gives
   repentance--that it is one of the free gifts of His Grace--and that
   whoever has it may rest assured that the hand of the Lord has been upon
   him for good and that, in fact, the work of salvation has been already
   begun in his soul!

   Further, to preach repentance in the name of Jesus also means that
   wherever there is real repentance, it is the token of the pardon of
   sin--not merely a hopeful sign, but the sure and Infallible sign of
   pardon. If any man's heart is turned away from sin. If he prostrates
   himself in the dust before God because of his offenses. If he looks
   with true penitence to Christ upon the Cross, crying, "Lord, remember
   me," "Lord, save me," "God be merciful to me, a sinner"--it is not a
   question whether forgiveness may or may not be granted to him--it is a
   fact that he is already forgiven! David's words are still true, "The
   Lord is near unto them that are of a broken heart; and saves such as
   are of a contrite spirit." It was for such as these that Jesus suffered
   upon Calvary. So let the message ring out through every land beneath
   the canopy of Heaven, that wherever there is a soul that loathes sin
   and leaves sin, Eternal Mercy has already commenced its gracious work
   and that soul is forgiven!

   I also think that to preach repentance in the name of Jesus means that
   we are to preach it on the authority of Jesus. We are not merely to bid
   men repent and to try to persuade them to do so by various reasons that
   might be urged! We are to take far higher ground than that, as Paul did
   at Athens when he said, "The times of this ignorance God winked at; but
   now commands all men everywhere to repent." The servants of Christ are
   not to preach repentance on their own authority, or even on the
   authority of the Church of Christ, but they are to preach it on the
   authority of the Church's ascended Head! This was Christ's own message,
   for we read, "After that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
   Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God and saying, The
   time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and
   believe the Gospel." So no true minister of Christ need be either
   afraid or ashamed to tell sinners--even the very worst sinners--that
   they should repent! When Jesus went into the country of the Gadarenes,
   a man possessed by an unclean spirit met Him--a wild man whom no mere
   human being could tame, a man who snapped the fetters and chains with

   which he was bound, a man who lived in the mountains, or among the
   tombs, a man who was a terror to the whole countryside and from whom
   all who could, fled--did Jesus flee from him or pass him by as too bad
   to be cured? No, the fiat of Omnipotence was, "Come out of the man, you
   unclean spirit." And though it was not merely one demon, but a whole
   legion of evil spirits that possessed the man, they all departed at
   Christ's command! And the man, himself, was shortly afterwards found
   "sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind." And
   soon he, too, was taken into Christ's service, "and began to publish in
   Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did
   marvel." In like manner, the true minister of Christ is not only to
   call upon the most moral and the most hopeful to repent, but he is to
   give the same message to the most immoral and the most hopeless! On the
   day of the Pentecost, when Peter had charged his hearers with putting
   Jesus to death, they were pricked in their heart and said to the
   Apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said to
   them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus
   Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the
   Holy Spirit." You know what followed--about three thousand of them
   gladly received Peter's words, were baptized and the same day were
   added to the Church! Our commission to preach the Gospel to every
   creature was issued by Him to whom all power in Heaven and in earth had
   been given! It is, therefore, under Divine authority that "repentance
   and remission of sins" are to be preached in Christ's name among all
   nations! "Repentance and remission" are so joined together that
   wherever we find the one, we are sure to find the other. Where there is
   no repentance, there can be no remission. But where there is true
   repentance--that godly sorrow for sin that needs not to be repented
   of--there is the full and free forgiveness of all sins of the one who
   has thus sincerely repented!

   According to our text, this remission of sins is to be preached in the
   name of Jesus. We have the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ for
   declaring that "all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
   men." And when Paul was preaching at Antioch concerning the
   Resurrection of Christ, he put this Truth of God very plainly--"Be it
   known unto you, therefore, brethren, that through this Man is preached
   unto you the forgiveness of sins and by Him all that believe are
   justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the
   Law of Moses." We also are to preach, not as unauthorized persons who
   hope that what we say may possibly prove to be true, but as those who
   are proclaiming Divine Truths and certainties on the authority of the
   Lord Jesus Christ Himself! As one of the Lords witnesses, let me tell
   you, my dear Hearers, that there is promised to penitents a full pardon
   of every sin they have ever committed, whether it has been a sin of
   thought, or word, or deed--whether it has been a sin of omission or of
   commission! This pardon makes a clean sweep of the accumulated heaps of
   defilement that have resulted from years of iniquity! It is a pardon as
   great as it is full--pardon for the most horrible and oft-repeated
   offenses, pardon for uncleanness, for theft, for blasphemy, even for
   murder if the murderer has truly repented! It is a--

   "Pardon for crimes of deepest dye, A pardon bought with Jesus' blood."
   The blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses from all sin, all who
   truly repent and believe in Him! It cleanses from the sins that banish
   men from the presence of their fellows, and from the sins that would
   banish them forever from the Presence of the thrice-holy God! Yes,
   pardon is to be proclaimed in the name of Jesus for sins such as
   these--they are not too black to be forgiven by God--they are not too
   deeply ingrained to be washed out by the precious blood of Jesus!

   And this great and full pardon is also a pardon that is given
   instantaneously. In a moment the guilt of the penitent sinner is
   forgiven! To quote Hart, again, "His pardon at once he receives." The
   instant that faith is begotten in the soul, we are justified in the
   sight of God and we can say with the Apostle Paul, "Who shall lay
   anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies." The
   believing penitent turns his weeping eyes to Christ upon the Cross,
   gazes with mingled sorrow and joy upon the blood that flowed from His
   many wounds, places all his reliance upon the God-appointed
   Propitiation, "the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world,"
   and in that verymomentall his iniquities are gone forever! The Lord has
   blotted them out and driven them away like clouds that have been
   dispersed by a tornado, and that can never be found again!

   This pardon is realized by the penitent sinner who receives it. "The
   Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children
   of God." Oftentimes, the sense of pardon comes upon a man like a piece
   of good news that makes him almost leap for joy--he was never before
   thrilled with so wondrous an emotion! He is half inclined to sing--

   "He has lifted me out of the miry clay, And set my feet on the King's
   Highway"--

   but, perhaps, instead of doing so, he bows himself before the Lord in
   solemn silence, feeling that he could never express the gratitude he
   feels for such amazing mercy. Or, possibly, he finds David's words just
   suited to his experience and, therefore, he says, "Bless the Lord, O my
   Soul: and all that is within me, bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, O
   my Soul, and forget not all His benefits who forgives all your
   iniquities." He realizes, as David did, that all his iniquities are
   forgiven and with the royal Psalmist he sings, "Blessed is he whose
   transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered."

   Nor is this all, for this pardon is one that is never reversed. O
   Sinner, if you really repent of your sin and believe in Jesus, the
   sinner's Savior, you are saved with an everlasting salvation! Remember
   that you have to deal with a God who never changes--He gives to the
   guilty penitent full and free forgiveness, not a reprieve or a respite!
   Once washed in the precious blood of Jesus, you shall never go back to
   your sin so as to live in it, and to die in it and perish. If you are
   truly trusting in Jesus, you are saved, not merely for today, tomorrow
   and next week, but forever. What says the Lord Jesus Christ Himself?
   "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me: and I
   give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall
   any pluck them out of My hand." Were you, my dear Hearer, ever pardoned
   by God for Christ's sake? Then you are pardoned forever! But if not, I
   pray that you may repent and believe the Gospel this very hour.

   Perhaps you say, "But all this seems so strange to me. You tell me that
   my sins can all be forgiven in a moment, and forgiven forever--and that
   I have nothing to pay for this priceless blessing, but am simply bid to
   repent of my sin and believe in Jesus." Yes, that is all true. But I do
   not ask you to believe it because I say it, for I only repeat to you
   the message that I have received from the Lord Jesus Christ, Himself,
   through His Word and by His Spirit. He cannot lie--and it is He who
   says, "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His
   name among all nations." He has given the best proof possible that your
   sins can be forgiven in the fact that He died in the place of sinners.
   Jesus Christ, who was God as well as Man, suffered as the Substitute of
   all who believe in Him. He bore their sins in His own body up to the
   tree and away from the tree! And now, for all who truly trust Him,
   there is no condemnation forever!

   "But," says one, "I do not doubt that repentance and remission of sins
   are to be preached in Christ's name. My difficulty is as to whether
   they are for me!" Well, that is a point that you must settle under the
   guidance of the Holy Spirit. Have you really repented of your sin? Have
   you sorrowed over it as the great curse of your life? Have you hated it
   and turned away from it, and sought to live as the holy God would have
   you live? Well, then, if the repentance is yours, the remission, also,
   is yours--for they go together in Christ's own words--"repentance and
   remission of sins." To hate sin because it slew Christ. To hate sin
   because God is so good that we ought not to sin against Him. To hate
   sin because God is so gracious as to forgive it. To weep over sin, not
   like a child who has done wrong, and so keeps away from his father, but
   like a penitent child who lays his head in his father's bosom and sobs
   out his grief there, and mourns that he has offended such a loving
   father who is so ready to forgive him--this is evangelical repentance
   and wherever it is found, there is also the remission of sins! If you
   do not know experimentally what it is thus to repent, breathe the
   prayer, "O Lord, show me the guilt of my sin. Teach me to mourn over
   it, to loath it and leave it. Let me see Your dear Son bearing its
   penalty on my behalf and then assure me, by Your Spirit's gracious
   instructions, that my sins, which were many, are all forgiven for
   Jesus' sake, that so I may go on my way rejoicing as a sinner saved by
   Sovereign Grace."

   Those of you who were here last Sabbath morning [See Sermon #925,
   Volume 16--INDIVIDUAL SIN LAID ON JESUS.] will remember that my text
   was, "All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned, every one,
   to his own way; and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all."
   And you will also recollect that I tried to describe various characters
   to whom that verse applies. I hope God gave comfort and blessing to
   some who listened to the sermon here. But oh, it was a joy to me to
   hear of one far away in Scotland who had been for years desponding and
   despairing who was led to find rest and peace through reading the
   printed sermon! But why should not many more of you be blessed while
   hearing the Word of God as so many are in reading it? Poor captive
   Soul, why should you not be set at liberty? Arise and shake yourself
   from the dust, for in Christ's name pardon is preached unto you if you
   will but repent of your sins and trust Him to save you from them!

   II. Now, secondly, we are to think of THE AUDIENCE THAT IS TO BE
   ADDRESSED UPON THIS SUBJECT--

   "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name
   among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."

   Why is this Gospel to be preached among all nations Well, first,
   because all nations need it! And then, because the Gospel is exactly
   suited to all nations. And further, because God has a chosen number in
   all nations who will receive the Word and be saved by it. And also
   because it shall be a witness against those in all nations who hear it
   but refuse to heed it.

   Some nations were learned, yet when Paul was addressing the Greeks who
   were proud of their philosophy and were continually seeking after
   wisdom, he preached repentance and remission of sins in Christ's
   name--the same A B C Doctrine of Jesus Christ and Him crucified that he
   proclaimed wherever he went! And the greatest scholars of the present
   day, if they would be wise unto salvation, must stoop to learn the same
   Gospel alphabet! No, rather they will be elevatedas they acquire these
   elements and rudiments of heavenly knowledge and become scholars in
   Christ's School of Grace!

   Other nations were very ignorant. In the Apostles' days there were some
   parts of the earth where the people were rude barbarians without any
   knowledge of books and letters. Yet the Apostles went to them and
   preached repentance and remission of sins--and the Gospel was simple
   enough for them to understand--and many of the heathen turned from
   their idols to serve the living God! And in later days, many of the
   greatest triumphs of the Truth of God have been won among the savages
   and untutored tribes of Africa, India and North America--and the
   islands of the southern seas. Ignorant and degraded as they were, many
   of them have become new creatures in Jesus Christ, living here to the
   praise and glory of God and, in due time, going to join the ranks of
   the blessed above!

   There are nations that worship God after a very imperfect fashion,
   although they know not Jesus Christ, whom He has sent to be the Savior
   of sinners. To these, also, we must preach repentance and remission of
   sins in Christ's name, for no man can come unto the Father except by
   Jesus Christ, His Son! Men cannot know God until they see the
   brightness of His Glory revealed in the Person of Jesus Christ. To
   theists and polytheists, those who believe in one God and those who
   worship "gods many and lords many," we have but one message, even that
   which our Lord Himself delivered, "Repent you, and believe the Gospel."
   And already, many of them, by Divine Grace, have repented and received
   the remission of their sins in Christ's name!

   There are three very important words at the end of our text--"beginning
   at Jerusalem." John Bunyan has a masterly treatise upon this text,
   entitled The Jerusalem sinner saved; or, goodnews for the vilest ofmen:
   being a help for despairing souls, showing that Jesus Christ would have
   mercy in the first place offered to the biggest sinners. Those of you
   who have his works will find the whole treatise well worth reading, but
   I am going to borrow some of his divisions and speak upon them after my
   own fashion.

   Bunyan's first reason why Christ would have mercy proclaimed first to
   the biggest sinners is "because the biggest sinners have most need
   thereof" A surgeon who is caring for the wounded on a battlefield and
   who has several soldiers awaiting his attention, will be anxious,
   first, to attend to the man who is the most seriously hurt and whose
   life seems fast ebbing away. He will leave for a while the one who has
   only a slight scratch or cut on his flesh, and devote all his thought
   and care to the man who is so terribly maimed and lacerated that it is
   a marvel how he manages to live at all! He will have him put in the
   ambulance and taken at once to the field hospital, that his life may be
   saved if it is possible. And oh, if among my hearers there are some
   great offenders--some who have sinned very terribly, some who have
   sinned against God and man, against their own bodies and souls, some
   who may be truly called, "Jerusalem sinners, the vilest of men"--I want
   to assure them, first, that my Master has sent me to preach especially
   to them and to tell them that if they repent of their sins--many and
   great as they have been--they shall all be forgiven!

   Bunyan's second reason why Christ would have mercy preached first to
   the biggest sinners is "because when they, any of them, receive it, it
   redounds most to the fame of His name." If a doctor cures someone's
   finger that is only slightly injured, he may get the credit of it, yet
   no one will say much about it. But if there is a person who is
   suffering from a disease that is believed to be incurable and a wise
   physician is the means of his restoration to health, how the whole
   neighborhood will ring with his praises! When someone else is very ill,
   friends will say, "You should send for Dr. So-and-So. You know what he
   did for that other poor man, perhaps he could do as much for you." And
   when the Lord Jesus Christ saves some black blasphemer or some leader
   in vice and iniquity, how fast the news flies throughout the whole
   region where he lives! Why, even among the lowest of the low, when one
   of their companions is converted, you know how they talk about it! They
   cry, "Have you heard what's happened to old Jack?" "No. What is it?"
   "Why, you know that he used to go along with us, first in all manner of
   evil--and now he has become a Christian!" That is sure to be repeated
   among all his old connections and so Christ gets fame and honor through
   His great work of Grace and, therefore, it is that He would have the
   biggest sinners specially bid to repent and believe the Gospel.

   Bunyan's third reason is "because, by their forgiveness and salvation,
   others, hearing of it, will be encouraged the more to come to Him for
   life" When sinners hear that some big black sinner has been forgiven by
   Christ, they naturally ask, "Then why should not we be forgiven?" A
   rebel city is besieged and the king threatens to hang every traitor
   when he captures it. They do all they can to strengthen their defenses
   and to beat off the besiegers, resolved never to yield. But when one of
   their greatest captains is captured and the king, instead of hanging
   him, sends him back to the city loaded with gifts and bids him tell his
   fellow rebels that if they will only open the gates, he will forgive
   them and he will give them a royal charter for their city, and will be
   the patron of all their industries, what do they do? Why, Sirs, they
   fling wide the gates! They ring the bells and they beg the king to
   enter at once and accept their loyal homage! You can easily apply the
   parable to your own case. I pray that many of you may do so right now.

   The time flies so fast that I cannot take Bunyan's lessons in detail.
   His next one is that when the biggest sinners are saved, they weaken
   Satan's kingdom the most. Catch the ringleaders and you can soon break
   up the band. Often one man can twist quite a number round his fingers
   and make them do as he pleases. When he is converted, he brings his
   mates to hear the preacher whose word was blessed to him--and thus many
   are won to Christ and Satan's ranks are thinned!

   Besides, how it strengthens the Church when great sinners are converted
   It was a great day for the Churches of England when John Bunyan was
   saved. It was a glorious day for the Apostolic Churches when Saul the
   persecutor became Paul the preacher! And this will be a grand night for
   the Tabernacle Church if the Lord will turn some great sinner here from
   the error of his ways and enlist him beneath the banner of the Cross!
   This is the kind of man who will lead the forlorn to hope in Christ,
   and plant the victorious banner of the Gospel on heights of sin that
   seem inaccessible to ordinary Christians! Great sinners, when they are
   converted, are the men to do great exploits in the name of Jesus!

   Further, where great sinners are forgiven, it is a clear proof that the
   Gospel has power to bless other sinners. When the elephants entered the
   ark, all the beasts outside could see that the door was wide enough to
   admit them. As God's Grace saved the chief of sinners, that Grace can
   save you, my Friend, however great a sinner you have been! There may
   have come in here tonight, as they often do, those who are not usually
   found in places of worship. My Brother or my Sister, for as such I
   regard you, sinner as you are, I have to tell you that if you will
   repent of your sin and trust in Jesus as your Savior, you shall go out
   of this house justified, even as the publican went out of the Temple of
   old after he had, from the depths of his soul cried, "God be merciful
   to me, a sinner!"

   Thus have I tried to preach repentance and remission of sins in
   Christ's name to the Jerusalem sinners, the very worst men and women
   here! But I must not close without also preaching in the same fashion
   to you who think you are notthe worst sinners here. O you respectable
   sinners, you moral and amiable sinners! You also need a Savior! Though
   you would stand by yourselves and say, "God, we thank You that we are
   not as other men and as other women are," yet Christ's message to you
   is, "You must be born-again." You, too, need to be washed in the
   precious blood of Jesus! Therefore, in His name, I preach to you
   "repentance and remission of sins," just as I have done to the greatest
   sinners here. May the ever-blessed Spirit come to you and take away
   your pride and your self-righteousness, and bring you down where you
   must come--just as publicans and harlots must come--to the pierced feet
   of Him who loves sinners, receives sinners and saves sinners--and who
   will receive you and save you if you will but trust Him! God grant it
   for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ACTS2:36-47.

   You know that Peter had been preaching a plain, simple, straightforward
   sermon upon the death, Crucifixion and Resurrection of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. He who was once such a coward that he trembled before a little
   maid, now that he is filled with the Spirit, boldly charges this crowd
   with being murderers and Deicides because their kind put to death the
   Lord of Life and Glory! If you turn to the 36th verse, you will see the
   effect of Peter's plain preaching through the power of the Holy
   Spirit--

   36, 37. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
   has made that same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ
   Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart [See Sermon
   #2102, Volume 35--"pricked

   IN THEIR HEART.] A little later in this same Book, we read of those

   who listened to Stephen's sharp, sword-like sentences, "When they heard
   these things, they were cut to the heart"--and soon they stoned Stephen
   to death! To be "cutto the heart" is not enough! But to be prickedin
   the heart is to receive a mortal wound! Happy is the man who has had
   his sin killed through having received a deadly wound from the sword of
   the Spirit, which is the Word of God! These people who heard Peter
   preach "were pricked in their heart" and, first, they were in doubt as
   to what they should do, but secondly, they were resolved that whatever
   they were told to do they would do at once.

   37, 38. Andsaid unto Peter and to the rest ofthe Apostles, Men and
   brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be
   baptized, everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission
   of sin, and you shall receive the gift ofthe Holy Spirit Nobody but a
   Baptist minister could have preached that sermon! At least we shall
   have to wait a long while before we hear any other saying to a whole
   congregation, "Repent, and be baptized, everyone of you." This is,
   indeed, the full proclamation of the Gospel--and we have no more right
   to leave out the Baptism than we have to leave out the repentance!
   "Repent, and be baptized, everyone of you." Peter was not like those
   hyper-Calvinists who are afraid to give an exhortation to a sinner
   because he is spiritually dead! He spoke out boldly to those who had
   asked, "What shall we do?" and said to them, "Repent, and be baptized,
   everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins."

   39. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that
   are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God

   shall call. [See Sermon #2586, Volume 44--A FAR-REACHING PROMISE.] This
   is

   a most blessed verse. The promise is to us and to our descendants--not
   merely to our children, but also to our grandchildren. Yes, and to our
   race as far as it yet may run! And the next clause, "and to all that
   are afar off" proves that the promise is made to the far-off ones as
   well as to our children, with only this limitation, "even as many as
   the Lord our God shall call."

   40. And with many other works did he testify and exhort, saying, Save
   yourselves from this untoward generation.. Not, "save yourselves from
   Hell"--that Christ, alone, can do for you, but "save yourselves from
   this generation" by coming boldly out from among the ungodly, taking
   upon you the distinctive mark of the Christian and so separating
   yourselves from those upon whom the sentence of death shall fall.

   41-45. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
   same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And
   they continued steadfastly in the Apostle's Doctrine and fellowship,
   and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every
   soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the Apostles. And all
   that believed were together, and had all things common; and sold their
   possessions and goods and parted them to all men, as every man had
   need.What a notable instance this was of the power of Divine Grace! We
   would not usually suppose that the Jewish race would be given to any
   excess of making common property--but where Grace came in the first
   flush of its dawn, see to what prodigies of liberality it excited the
   early Believers! Would that we had more of this generous spirit
   nowadays!

   46. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and
   breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness
   and singleness of heart.I believe that wherever two or three disciples
   of Christ meet together it is competent for them to celebrate the
   Lord's Supper. That ordinance is not, as some think it to be, a Church
   ordinance, to be confined to the official assembling of all
   Believers--but wherever two or three are met in Christ's name, there He
   is--and where He is, there may the emblems of His broken body and shed
   blood be partaken of in memory of Him!

   47. Praising God, and having favor with all His people. And the lord
   added to the Church daily such as should be

   saved. [See Sermon #1167, Volume 20--ADDITIONS TO THE CHURCH.

Finding and Following Christ

   (No. 3225)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 24H, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 21, 1870.

   "We have found Him." John 1:45.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon on verses 43 to 45 is #2375, Volume
   40--FOUND BY JESUS--AND FINDING JESUS.]

   I HOPE there are many here who are seeking Christ, but I feel sure that
   there are with us many more who can truthfully say, "We have passed
   beyond that stage, for we have found Him." Others may declare that
   there never was such a Person as Jesus of Nazareth, but we know there
   was and still is, for, "we have found Him," and we are living in happy
   daily fellowship with Him! We bear our glad testimony to what the Grace
   of God has done for us and we say with Philip, "We have found Him, of
   whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth,
   the son of Joseph," whom we also worship as the Son of God.

   Notice how positively Philip speaks. He had, himself, only just been
   found by Christ, yet he does not say, "We think we have found the
   Messiah," or, "We hope we have found the promised Deliverer." No,
   without the slightest hesitation he says, "We have found Him." This is
   a matter about which it is possible for us to be quite as positive as
   Philip was. There are abundant reasons why we may have a well-grounded
   assurance that Christ is our Savior if we have truly trusted in Him.
   Some have thought and said that it is not possible for us to know we
   are saved. Thank God that is not true and many can adopt the Inspired
   Language of the Apostle John and say, "We know that the Son of God has
   come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is
   true, and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son, Jesus Christ.
   This is the true God, and eternal life." Such positiveness as this is
   attainable, by God's Grace, by every true Believer in Jesus Christ!

   Let me remind you, first, that it ought to be so. Whether we are saved
   or not is a matter of the greatest importance to us. We cannot afford
   to let it rest upon a, "perhaps," or a, "maybe." If I have really found
   Christ, my sins are forgiven me for His sake--and this is a fact of
   which I ought to be quite certain. If I have found the Lord Jesus
   Christ, I am reconciled to God by the death of His Son, I have been
   adopted into the family of God, I may confidently look to God for the
   supply of all my needs, both for this life and for that which is to
   come--and I may expect to be taken at the right time to dwell with Him
   forever. Such glorious blessings as these ought not to be mere matters
   of speculation with us! Our possession of them ought to be the result
   of clean, unmistakable evidence. If I have not found Christ, I am in
   danger of death every day and of the Hell that is the everlasting
   prison of all unbelievers. If I have not found Christ, I am still
   without hope and without God in the world--"condemned already"--because
   I have not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God! Surely
   I ought not to go to bed tonight with that all-important question
   unsettled. I can understand a man being in doubt upon this matter, but
   I cannot understand his resting comfortably while it is a matter of
   doubt! If you are content to be in doubt as to whether you are entitled
   to your estates, or as to whether you are mortally diseased or not,
   well, those are only minor matters compared with the salvation of your
   souls! God forbid that you should be willing to let the far greater
   matter remain in suspense! Seek the aid of the Holy Spirit and never
   rest satisfied until you know assuredly that you have found the Lord
   Jesus Christ as your Savior!

   A poor woman, some nights ago, wrapping around herself her poor thin
   shawl, was walking along the street because she had nowhere else to go.
   And as she was passing a certain building, she saw written over the
   door, "For the homeless." "That is the place for me," she said, and in
   she went. Now, my Friend, are you a sinner? Then I have to tell you
   that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. Are you lost?
   Then I have to tell you that He came to seek and to save the lost. It
   would have done that poor woman no good at all to sit down on a rich
   man's doorstep and consider how poor she

   was--she got what she needed by going to the Home for the Homeless--and
   Jesus Christ is a Home for Homeless souls, so away with you, poor
   homeless soul, and find in Him the shelter that you need! May God's
   Grace enable you to flee straight away to Christ, for if you do, He
   will not refuse to receive you!

   Remember, also, that no real spiritual comfort can come to us until we
   know that we have found Christ. Perhapses and maybes are like thorns in
   our pillow--they prevent us from resting. Or they are like stones in a
   pilgrim's shoes-- they make walking very uncomfortable for him. To be
   able to say with Paul, "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded
   that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against
   that day," is to have a fountain of consolation springing up within
   your heart! But to have to cry--

   "'Tis a point I long to know,

   Oft it causes anxious thought--

   Do I love the Lord, or no?

   Am I His, or am I not?"

   is to be in continual unhappiness! The man who is in such a state as
   that may be safe, but he cannot have joy and peace. He must be weak,
   trembling and tossed to and fro, like the waves of the troubled sea
   when it cannot rest. It is only when we can say with David, "My heart
   is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise," that
   there is the music of deep and lasting joy in the songs that we send up
   to Heaven!

   Let me add that you may confidently hope to attain this assurance of
   knowledge because so many others have already done so. I have reminded
   you of Philip, John and Paul, but such knowledge as this was not
   confined to the Apostolic age--it is at this moment the priceless
   privilege of tens of thousands of Believers in the Lord Jesus Christ!
   If I were now to say, "Let all those Brothers and Sisters who know that
   Christ is theirs stand up and testify to this fact," I believe that the
   bulk of this congregation would at once rise! And I pray that you
   weaker ones, you timid and trembling souls may seek Him who can work
   this great Grace in you, also, so that you, too, may be able to say as
   positively as Philip did, "We have found Him."

   Now I am going, with the Holy Spirit's help, to suggest a few
   reflections for those to bear in mind who can say, "We have found Him."
   And the first is this--IF WE HAVE FOUND CHRIST, HE MUST HAVE FIRST
   FOUND US.

   Two verses (v 43) before our text, we read that this very man who had
   found Christ, had himself been found by Christ. It is probably true, my
   dear Brother or Sister in Christ, that you were brought to know the
   Lord through some human instrumentality. A godly father or mother, a
   faithful minister of the Gospel, a loving Sunday school teacher or
   other Christian friend. Or the reading of the Word under the guidance
   of the Holy Spirit may have been the means of your conversion. There is
   a very precious link between the instrument of your salvation and
   yourself which you ought never to forget. Surely we can never cease to
   thank God for the man or the woman whom He used to lead us out of
   darkness into His marvelous Light! Yet that holy man did not convert
   us. That gracious woman could never have given us a new heart and a
   right spirit. We must trace our new birth to its superhuman origin--it
   was the Lord, and the Lord alonewho worked that wondrous miracle of
   regeneration! "You has HE quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
   sins." If the Lord has not turned you from the error of your ways, you
   are still in the broad road that leads to destruction! If He has not
   found you as the shepherd finds his lost sheep, you are still wandering
   on the dark mountains of sin and woe! And, as the sheep would never
   find its shepherd unless he first found it, so you, if you have found
   Christ, must first have been found by Christ!

   I want you to go still further back and to remember that, inasmuch as
   you never imagined that it was wrong for Christ to save you, although
   He has not saved all other sinners and although some in your own family
   have not yet found Him-- and although some who attend the same place of
   worship as you do have not found Him, while you have found Him and been
   found by Him--you have never thought that it was wrong for Christ to
   make this difference between you and others. I want you to also
   remember that whatever Christ has done, He must have always meant to
   do--it must have been His eternal purpose to do it! Unless you are a
   careless blunderer, you do not do anything without having made up your
   mind to do it. And certainly, the Lord Jesus Christ has not acted in
   this great matter of the salvation of souls without thought and
   deliberation! Do you not see that this brings us to the Doctrine of
   Election? Many people do not like that Doctrine, but all Christian
   people, though they may not believe it as we do, must believe that
   which is the very essence of it--for if there is a difference between
   ourselves and others, it must have been Christ who made it by His
   Grace! And as He made it, then it must have been right for Him to make
   it, and it could not have been wrong for Him to purpose to make that
   difference! We do not believe that Christ does anything without a plan
   and a purpose. And it makes no difference whether the purpose was in
   His mind a year ago or from all eternity! I mean that there would be
   the same difficul-

   ty with regard to the Doctrine, though I see no difficulty in it at
   all. Well then, the Lord Jesus Christ purposed from all eternity to
   work His good work in you by His Holy Spirit--to bring you to repent of
   your sin and to trust in His atoning Sacrifice--and, therefore, it is a
   part of His promise to bring you home to Heaven to dwell with Him
   forever! Yet there have been and still are many in this world who have
   not found Him--more eminent than you are, people of greater ability and
   loftier station. There are wise men who have never become wise unto
   salvation and rich men who do not possess this heavenly treasure. There
   are mighty kings who lord it over mighty hosts of men, who know not the
   Lord of Hosts and yield not homage to the Lord Jesus Christ! When you
   think of all this, do you not marvel that you should have been found by
   Christ and that you should have found Christ? Do you not wonder that
   God should have chosen you, that Christ should have redeemed you, that
   the Holy Spirit should have regenerated you? And will you not bless and
   praise the Lord to all eternity for making you the simple subject of
   His Grace while such multitudes and so many far more mighty ones have
   been passed by?

   This teaching, which seems to me to be so simple and plain, lies at the
   root of the most profound Doctrines of Holy Writ and it is, at the same
   time, one of the most practical Truths of God in the whole of the
   Divine Revelation! Nothing makes us love Christ more than knowing that
   He has loved us with an everlasting Love and, therefore, with loving
   kindness has drawn us unto Himself. Nothing makes us crave for likeness
   to Him so much as the knowledge that He has chosen us and ordained us,
   that we should go and bring forth fruit and that our fruit should
   remain even, "fruit unto holiness, and the end, everlasting life." I
   wish that this Truth was understood and believed by all Christians, for
   it is God's Truth, and a very precious Truth. I feel sure that it is
   believed by many who have not recognized it or fully understood it. I
   remember preaching in the open air to a great crowd of miners, most of
   them Methodists. And as I preached, they shouted, "Glory!"
   "Hallelujah!" "Praise the Lord," and so on. Just as they were in full
   cry in that fashion, I paused a moment and then said, "This brings me
   to the Doctrine of Election." I could almost feel the cold shiver of
   disappointment that seemed to pass through the crowd. And it appeared
   likely that there would be no more "Hallelujahs" during that discourse.
   But I said to them, "In your hearts you really believe that Doctrine,
   though you imagine you do not. And before I have finished my sermon, I
   will prove it to you, and many of you will shout, 'Praise the Lord,'
   for it even more loudly than you were doing just now." I saw the look
   of incredulity upon their faces, but I went on. "Here is a man who was
   once a drunk, a swearer, a Sabbath-breaker, a thief, a liar and
   everything that was bad. But a great change has somehow come over him
   and he is quite a new man compared with what he used to be. There is no
   such alteration in many of his old companions and friends--who can have
   made him so different from what he once was? Here is a glorious golden
   crown and whoever has made this man to be such a contrast to what he
   was before ought to have this crown placed upon his head!" Then I said,
   "Shall I put the crown on the man's own head? Did he make this change
   in himself?" "No, no" came the answer from all parts of the crowd.
   "Well then," I asked, "On whose head shall I put the crown? Who is to
   have the glory of this man's conversion?" At once they cried, "The
   Lord, the Lord alone! Put the crown on His head." So far we were all
   agreed and I, therefore, asked next, "Was it wrong for God to make this
   difference?" No one dared to say that it was, so I advanced to my next
   question, "As it was right for God to make this difference, was it not
   also right for God to plan beforehand that He would do so? The Lord did
   not act without a set purpose and, therefore, as He is to be crowned
   for the action, is He not also to be crowned for the purpose to do it?"
   "Yes, that He is!" cried the crowd. "Bless His name, hallelujah!" So I
   won the hallelujahs, by His Grace, of my Methodist friends for the
   Doctrine of Election as I said I would!

   We do not preach, we have never preached and we shall never preach that
   God has created any man for the purpose of destroying him! But we do
   preach and shall preach as long as we live, that salvation is of the
   Lord and all of Grace from first to last! And, therefore, that all the
   glory of it must be given to the Divine hand that worked the work, to
   the eternal mind that planned the work and to the great heart of love
   that was the Fountain and Source from which the gracious purpose
   sprang! The only explanation of the whole matter is the one we have so
   often sung--

   "What was there in you that could merit esteem, Or give the Creator
   delight? 'Twas even so, Father,'you always must sing, 'Because it
   seemed good in Your sight' Then give all the glory to His holy name, To
   Him all the glory belongs, Be yours the high joy to still sound forth
   His fame, And crown Him in each of your songs."

   II. My second observation is--IF WE HAVE FOUND CHRIST, LET US FOLLOW
   HIM. Philip found Him and followed Him all his days.

   Christ was given to be the Leader and Commander of His people, so His
   people should all follow Him. You have followed Him, Beloved, but can
   you not follow Him yet more closely? You are His disciples, but can you
   not learn more of Him than you have yet learned? Let us follow our
   Jesus promptly. I want to be in such a state of heart and mind that the
   moment I know what Christ's will concerning me is, I do it! I would
   like to be a leaf borne along by the blessed current of His Divine
   Purpose--having no will or wish to resist the sacred influences of His
   unerring mind and loving heart--to obey His commands promptly and
   cheerfully and, not only to obey cheerfully, but also to
   suffercheerfully if He so pleases! It is a blessed condition to be in
   to take anything and everything from Christ, whether it is a kiss or a
   blow--to do anything for Christ, whether it is pleasing to the flesh or
   not--to yield up everything for Christ, to be, indeed, a divine
   sacrifice for Him, which is, after all, only the "reasonable service"
   which He is fully entitled to claim from us! We read in the Revelation
   concerning some, "These are they which follow the Lamb wherever He
   goes." And happy are they who imitate them, even while here on earth!
   Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I entreat you to leave no path
   untrodden where you can see the footprints of your Lord and Master!
   Jesus went to Jordan's stream and was baptized there by John--have you
   followed Him in this blessed ordinance? Jesus, even while living and
   laboring among sinners, was separate from them--are you living the
   separated life? What He did, let us do as far as it is in our power!
   What He was, let us be as far as that is possible! He was reviled,
   despised and rejected of men--so let us count it an honor to receive
   similar treatment for His sake. He was content to walk on the bleak
   side of the hill--let us not seek the sunny side by craving the world's
   esteem. Is this your heart's desire, Beloved? Do you sing--

   "Through floods and flames, if Jesus leads, I'll follow where He goes"?

   Then mind that you not only singthose lines, but make them true in your
   life! Are any of you following Christ afar off, as Peter did? Then
   beware lest you fall as Peter did! Are you following Christ in your
   business, or do you forget Him when you are in the office or in the
   market? Do you follow Christ in your home, or do you forget Him when
   you are there? Some of you used to follow Jesus very closely and to be
   very warm friends of His--have you been growing cold towards Him? Oh,
   let this no longer be the case! If you have found Him, follow Him and
   follow Him "wherever He goes."

   III. Now, thirdly, IF WE HAVE FOUND CHRIST, LET US PRIZE HIM. It is no
   trifle that we find when we find Him, for He is the priceless pearl
   whose worth no man fully knows!

   If I have found Him, how shall I prove that I prize Him? First, let me
   be willing to lose all that I have for Him. Does my present position in
   life involve me in sin? Then let me leave it rather than grieve my
   Lord. Is my business an evil one? Then let me renounce it at once, for
   if I do not, I shall have to renounce Him! Have I any companions who
   are the enemies of Christ? Then I dare not call them my friends. Is
   there some dear one with whom I have entered into such close
   association that it will draw me away from Christ? Then, while I can,
   let me break the connection, for I must give up all for the Christ who
   gave up all for me! The captain of a vessel, when his ship is in danger
   of sinking, will throw the most valuable cargo into the sea if,
   thereby, he may save the ship and the lives of all on board. And I must
   be willing to part with my joys, my pleasures, my money, my friends and
   all that I have rather than give up my Lord and Savior, for I must have
   Christ at any cost!

   Further, if you have found Christ and want to prove that you can prize
   Him, study to find out all that you can about Him. Jesus Christ is a
   great mine of untold wealth and no man has ever yet perfectly explored
   that mine. Read the Scripture to learn all you can about Christ. Listen
   to any preacher or teacher who can tell you anything about Christ--and
   be sure to meditate as much as you can upon Christ. He is the chief
   among ten thousand--"yes, He is altogether lovely." At our first sight
   of Him, we fall in love with Him, but His choicest beauties are the
   hidden ones which we only find by diligent search and much fellowship
   with Him. As you get to know more of Him in His Person, in His work, in
   His office, in His promises, in His power, in His love--you will prize
   Him all the more until you would not set even Heaven, itself, in
   comparison with Him--for what would Heaven be if He were not there?

   Further, Beloved, if you prize Christ as you ought, you will make all
   the use you can of Him. And He loves to be of use to His people. Is
   there any sin upon your conscience? Run to Him to remove it from you!
   Is there any trouble on your mind? Go and tell Jesus! Is there anything
   that is a burden to you? Cast your burdens upon Him and He will relieve
   you of them, or give you the Grace and strength to carry them! Remember
   that Jesus Christ is an everyday Savior, an all-the-year-round Savior,
   a whole-of-life Savior, a Savior for the body as well as for the soul!
   Whatever there may be lacking in

   you, there is nothing lacking in Him and He can supply all that you
   lack! He is the Bread of Life, so feed upon Him! He is the Light of the
   World, so see everything in the light that comes from Him! He is your
   All-in-All, so look for all in Him!

   Show, too, that you prize Christ as you should by letting others see
   how you value Him. A bride who has many precious jewels will wear them
   where they can be seen and admired by others. And we, too, are to put
   on the Lord Jesus Christ who is more precious than all the gems in the
   universe! Some professing Christians are apt to blush at any allusion
   to their Christianity--but if it is the blush of shame, they have cause
   to be ashamed of such blushing! I never hear of any man blushing
   because he is a peer of the realm, though there have been many of the
   so-called "nobility" who might well cause their fellow peers to blush.
   But to blush because one is a Christian, oh, this must never be! As
   well might we blush at being likened to an angel! Suppose the ungodly
   point the finger of scorn at you--that is the only way in which such
   people can really honor you. Will you strike your colors because the
   enemy attacks you? No, no! Nail the flag to the mast and fight so
   bravely for Christ that the enemy has to strike hiscolors! It is the
   act of a pirate to sail under another flag, so whatever ship you meet
   on life's wide sea, fly the flag of your King and defy the devil and
   all his legions to do their worst! At home and abroad, in the House of
   God or in the street, in the market or wherever you may be, let friend
   and foe, alike, know that you belong to Christ! I would that all of us
   who are members of this Tabernacle might love the Lord with a far
   deeper and more fervent love than we have ever yet experienced. I know
   that there are some eminently gracious souls among us and I pray that
   their number may be greatly increased, but I am anxious lest, as a
   Church, we should fall to the low level of so many of the professing
   Christians of this age! Our Lord Jesus Christ deserves the very best
   that we can bring to Him, so let us give Him our hearts, our minds, our
   time, our talents and all we have, to show how greatly we prize Him
   whom we have found!

   IV. Fourthly, and briefly, IF WE HAVE FOUND CHRIST, LET US NEVER PART
   WITH HIM. Philip became one of Christ's disciples, then one of His
   Apostles--and now he is with Christ forever!

   Tomorrow you will go, young man, into the workshop or to the counter
   and your companions will laugh at you if you say you are a Christian.
   But do not part with Christ because of the laughter of fools! Some of
   you will be going to the Stock Exchange or to the various markets of
   this great city--but part not company with Christ by doing what is
   wrong. Hold Him fast and keep to that which is right, honest and true,
   for he is a traitor to Christ who gets even a penny by an unrighteous
   action! Tomorrow some of you may hear that which is blasphemous or
   foul--rebuke it in your Lord's name, for he who is silent when he ought
   to speak is tacitly denying his Lord and Master. Again I say to you,
   hold Him fast however much men may scoff at you for doing so, for such
   a treasure as Christ is well worth holding! Let no man separate you
   from your Lord. If you are truly His, I am persuaded that no one and
   nothing shall be able to part you. Though the devil himself should try
   to tear Christ away from you, he cannot do it, for Christ is stronger
   than Satan and He holds you with a Divine grip which the devil and all
   his hosts cannot relax!

   I especially urge you not to let Jesus slip away from private prayer,
   or the reading of the Scriptures, or your intimate personal communion
   with Him. Make your prayers more fervent, your study of the Word more
   intense and real, and your daily walk with Christ more close and
   tender. Abide in Him! Never give Him or anyone else cause to think that
   you have left Him. The good soldier of Jesus Christ never has a
   furlough--he is like the knights of old who slept in their armor and
   were ready for the fray at any moment. A Christian is to always be a
   Christian and in every place! He may not do wrong once a year, nor once
   in a lifetime. What would you say to a man who told you he was only
   going to poison himself once? What would you think of a wife who said
   she was going to cease loving her husband just once? We, too, are
   married to Christ, so we are His and wholly His--and only His! Hold us
   fast, O blessed Lover of our souls, for only so can we continue to hold
   You fast!

   V. My last injunction is this--IF YOU HAVE FOUND CHRIST, TELL OTHERS
   ABOUT HIM, even as Philip said to Nathanael, "We have found Him."

   I have sometimes feared that some professing Christians fancy that they
   are to keep Christ all to themselves. They seem to have an idea that
   Heaven is just--

   "A little spot enclosed by Grace"-- where only they and a small select
   company of like-minded persons will gain admittance! I cannot
   congratulate them upon harboring such a notion and I very strongly urge
   them to imitate the example of a man who found that he had a forged
   bank-note in his possession--he threw it over a hedge and ran away as
   fast as he could for fear anybody should think it belonged to him! Such
   a spirit as that seems to me to be quite contrary to the mind of Him
   who wept over Jerusa-

   lem and who said, "How often would I have gathered the children
   together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you
   would not!"

   Have you found this great hive of honey and is it very sweet to your
   taste? Then tell others of it, for there is abundance for them and you,
   too. You are not like the poor people in a besieged city who feel that
   every mouthful that someone else eats leaves so much the less for them.
   Oh, no! There is "bread enough and to spare" in the great Father's
   house, so no prodigal son need perish with hunger! At the Gospel
   banquet you may eat as much as you want, but there will be just as much
   left for others. We have to deal with the God who is Infinite and
   Omnipotent, whose supply is inexhaustible and who will be glad and
   gratified as we spread far and wide the invitations to the great feast
   in honor of His Son! My Brothers and Sisters in Christ, as you love
   Him, follow His blessed example by going after the lost sheep until you
   find them! If you had only common humanity, it ought to make you
   earnest in seeking to deliver others from going down to the Pit, by
   telling them of Him who has paid the ransom price for all who put their
   trust in Him! A battlefield must present a terrible sight to all who
   gaze upon it. I wish all those who are so eager for war could see the
   horrors of which we can scarcely bear to read. Yet this great London
   presents a still more terrible sight to those whose eyes have been
   opened to see sinners as they really are in the sight of God! Our
   streets swarm with the unregenerate! Many of you live next door to them
   when they are at home. Some of you live in the same house with them.
   Some even sleep in the same room with them. Plead for your husbands or
   wives, your brothers and sisters, your parents or children--and plead
   with them as well as forthem! God forbid that you should be eternally
   separated from those who are so near and dear to you! Pray for them
   night and day! You who are the Lord's remembrancers, take no rest and
   give Him no rest, and give them no rest until they are saved! Next to
   your own relatives, plead with and for your employees, your employer,
   your neighbors and all with whom you come in contact! And then widen
   your sympathies and supplications until they shall embrace all of woman
   born! Remember Richard Krill's question, "Brethren, the heathen are
   perishing, will you let them perish?" Do not neglect the heathen abroad
   or the heathen at home! An earnest minister said to his people one
   Sabbath, "I am going, this week on a mission to the heathen." The
   deacons looked at one another, for the pastor had not mentioned the
   matter to them. And the members thought, "We are about to lose our dear
   minister, but whatever has made him think of going as a missionary to
   the heathen?" While these thoughts were passing through their minds, he
   quietly added, "But I am not going out of this town in order to be a
   missionary."

   And there is no need for anybody to go out of town in order to be a
   missionary to the heathen! There they are, Brothers and Sisters, all
   around you! And you are the missionaries. There is your work--go and do
   it--and may God bless you in it--and so may many precious immortal
   souls through you be led to find Jesus and to trust in Him for
   salvation, for His name and mercy's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ACTS2:1-21.

   [The following Exposition is the earlier portion of the one published
   with Sermon #3224, Volume 56--"REPENTANCE AND REMISSION".]

   Verses 1-8. And when the day of Pentecost [See Sermons #511, Volume
   9--PENTECOST and #1783, Volume 30, also named PENTECOST.] was fully
   come, they were all with one accord in one place. And

   suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing mighty wind,
   andit filledall the house where they were sitting. And there appeared
   unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
   And they were all filed with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with
   other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were
   dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men out of every nation under
   Heaven. Now when this was told abroad, the multitude came together and
   were confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language.
   And they were all amazed and marveled, saying, one to another, Behold,
   are not all these which speak, Galileans? And how hear we every man in
   our own tongue, wherein we were born?These men, so far from being able
   to speak many languages, could not, by themselves, speak even one
   correctly! The Galileans dialect was a base degradation of the true
   Jewish tongue, so that the Galileans were always the subject of sneers
   and scoffing on account of their mispronunciation. There are several
   stories in the old Rabbinical writings, all intended to ridicule the
   Galileans--yet these men had now been taught to speak their own
   language perfectly and, what was still more marvelous--languages that
   they had never heard now came pouring forth

   from their lips with the greatest fluency! How wide the range of those
   foreign tongues was, we learn from the following verses--

   9-11. Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites and the dwellers in
   Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
   Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts in Libya about
   Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and
   Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of
   God. Babel's curse was now removed--not by a reversing of God's curse,
   for God's curses and blessings are both like the laws of the Medes and
   Persians which never can be altered. Men still spoke the tongues of
   confusion, but the Apostles were able to speak to them all after
   receiving that miraculous gift of tongues. Thus was fulfilled that
   promise of Jesus, "He that believes on Me, the works that I do shall he
   do also; and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto My
   Father." Christ never spoke with many tongues, nor did He enable His
   disciples to do so during His life on earth! But when He had gone back
   to Heaven to His Father and had received gifts for men, they were
   enabled to do greater works than He had accomplished by His personal
   ministry here below.

   12,13. And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
   another, What means this? Others mocking, said, These men are full of
   new wine.That is to say, if a Libyan, for instance, had been listening
   to one who was preaching in the language of Cappadocia, he might think
   that the man was merely babbling strange sounds without any meaning in
   them. To others, the Inspired Speech of the Apostles was only like the
   incoherent utterance of drunken men!

   14-20. But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
   andsaid to them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at
   Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: for these
   are not drunk as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the
   day. But this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel; and it
   shall come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out of My
   Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
   and

   your young men shall see visions in those days of My Spirit; and they
   shall prophesy: and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in
   the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke: the sun shall
   be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and
   notable day of the Lord comes. Doubtless this refers first to the siege
   of Jerusalem, when those strange portents were seen in the heavens, and
   afterwards to that far greater and more notable day of the Lord, the
   Day of Judgment, when the moon shall become as blood and the sun shall
   become black as sackcloth of hair.

   21. Andit shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of
   the Lord shall be saved. What a glorious Gospel verse this is! This is
   one of the great lifeboat-texts of the Bible. He who can get into this
   boat shall certainly sail to Glory in safety! "Whoever"--there is no
   exception of character, whatever his past life may have been! "Whoever
   shall call on the name of the Lord"--here are no hard
   conditions--prayer, trust, confession of that trust--all these make up
   calling upon the name of the Lord. And whoever shall do this, not only
   may be but, "shall be saved." There is no perhaps, no maybe about
   it--"Whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."

Figs and Olives

   (No. 3226)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 11, 1879.

   "Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olives?" James 3:12.

   THERE is only one answer to the question, of course, the fig tree can
   do nothing of the kind. It would be quite contrary to its nature and,
   therefore, the Apostle argues that Christians ought to act according to
   their nature. If we are, indeed, the children of God, we should act as
   His children and always act as His children. We are not consistent if
   at one time we speak as heirs of Heaven should speak and at another
   time speak as the heirs of wrath speak! James truly tells us that a
   fountain cannot, at the same time pour forth sweet water and bitter,
   salt water and fresh and he, therefore, rightly argues that from the
   same mouth there must not proceed blessing and cursing--there must be
   consistency of conduct in those who are the Lord's.

   I am going, in the first place, to take the question of our text out of
   its literal context. And in the second place to come closer to it. And,
   perhaps, in the third place to come still closer!

   I. So, first, "can the fig tree, my Brothers and Sisters, bear olives?"
   No. And IT IS VERY UNDESIRABLE THAT IT SHOULD! There is no need for it
   to do so, and there would be no gain if it should do so! I am, of
   course, taking the question altogether apart from its context. A fig
   tree is better employed in bearing figs than it would be in bearing
   olives. The olive tree is meant to bear olives and the fig tree to bear
   figs. And it would not be any advantage if it were to leave off bearing
   figs and begin bearing olives, or if it alternately bore figs and
   olives.

   Now, beloved Friends, all of us that are as trees of the Lord's
   right-hand planting are bringing forth fruit to His praise and glory.
   If we are carrying out His great purpose concerning us, we are
   producing the peaceable fruits of righteousness, the fruit of the
   Spirit, fruit unto holiness--but this fruit does not always take the
   same shape in every one of us. We cannot all do the same work! And even
   when our work is similar, we have various ways of doing it. I cannot do
   your work, my Brother or Sister, and you cannot do mine--and the two of
   us together cannot do a third person's work! There is a certain tree
   that produces a particular kind of fruit and a certain plant on which a
   special sort of seed is found, but no tree produces all kinds of fruit
   and no plant bears all sorts of seeds. So it is in the Church of
   God--all true Believers are members of the mystical body of Christ, but
   all the members have not the same office. It would be very foolish if
   any one member of the body were to attempt to perform the work of all
   the organs of the body or, indeed, of any beside its own. The best
   thing is for the eye to see and let the ear do the hearing, for the ear
   to hear and let the mouth do the speaking, for the feet to carry the
   body wherever the brain directs, and for the hands to perform their own
   special handicraft and not to usurp the office of the organs of
   locomotion!

   But why is it that the fig tree cannot bear olives and that one
   Christian cannot do all kinds of work? I answer, first, because the
   variety is, itself, charming. If anybody had the power to destroy all
   the fruit trees in the world and then to make a tree that would bear
   all the fruits at once--what a pity it would be! It is much better to
   have three trees to bear figs, olives and grapes than to have one tree
   bearing figs on one branch, olives on another and grapes on a third. It
   might seem a fine thing to have Christians who could do everything--men
   who could preach and pray and sing, who could be entrusted with great
   wealth and great talents, who could lead the Church and who could, at
   the same time, control the

   world, but that is not God's plan for any of His children! There is a
   beautiful variety in the Church of God--one exercises this gift and
   another exercises that. One is entrusted with one form of Grace and
   another is entrusted with equal Grace but in quite a different form. It
   would be no improvement if all flowers were of one color, or if all
   precious stones were of equal brilliance or if all stars gave exactly
   the same amount of light. Variety is a great part of beauty and God
   delights to have it so.

   We have here, in the next place, a display of Divine Sovereignty . It
   is God's will that makes yon bird that looks the sun in the face into
   an eagle! And that other whom sits moodily on the ivy-mantled tower
   into an owl! It is He who makes one of His creatures into an archangel
   and another into an aphid crawling on a rose leaf. None may ask Him why
   He acts thus, for He has the right to do as He pleases and, as Elihu
   said to Job, "He gives no account of any of His matters." Or, as Paul
   put it to the Romans, "Has not the potter power over the clay, of the
   same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?" It
   is quite certain that there are great differences among men. In the
   very size and shape of our bodies and in the natural conformation of
   our minds, we are not all alike. Let us say what we may, there are
   differences of capacity which are with us from our birth, even as God
   intended that there should be. He is in this matter, as in everything
   else, both Lord and King--so what folly and sin it is for us to quarrel
   with Him about our condition, or to attempt to arraign Him before our
   judgment seat! If God makes some other Brother to be like the fruitful
   tree that bears olives, shall I be jealous of him if my fruit is of
   another kind? Shall I not rather be thankful to resemble the tree that
   bears figs? And if we two see another Brother whose fruit is like the
   grapes of Eshcol, shall we envy him because we cannot bring forth such
   welcome clusters? Oh no! But let us all three bless the Lord for the
   sweetness of the figs, the fatness of the olives and the lusciousness
   of the grapes that He enables us severally to produce to His praise and
   glory!

   Further, these diversities of gifts should excite in us humility. What
   if the olive tree does bear its rich purple berries? It cannot bear
   sweet figs--and sweet as the figs are, they cannot supply the oil which
   gives a relish to the peasants' bread, feeds the lamp which lights his
   cottage in the evening hours and furnishes the medicine which heals him
   when he is sick or wounded. When the Lord entrusts you with talents, my
   Brother, you are naturally inclined to be proud. But when you hear of
   another whom the Lord has honored far more, do not quarrel either with
   the Lord or with your Brother, but rejoice that there is someone whose
   Master thinks he may be trusted to a very high degree! And remember
   that the responsibilities of your own position are quite sufficient for
   you. I am often amazed at the stupidity of certain Christians. They
   will not do what they cando--and they want to do what they cannotdo!
   They are not satisfied with walking, so they take up David's cry, "Oh
   that I had wings like a dove!" The Lord knew that they would not make a
   proper use of wings so He did not give them any! No doubt they think,
   if they had wings, they would fly away and be at rest, but I question
   whether they would be able to rest if they flew away from their right
   place and the work God has committed to their charge! Many a man is a
   first-rate Sunday school teacher, but that does not satisfy his
   ambition--he must be a preacher! When he gets into the pulpit, the only
   part of his discourse that is appreciated by his hearers is the end of
   it-- yet he says that he must preach! Many a good worker has been
   spoiled through imbibing the notion that he must do something for which
   God has not fitted him. There is a humbling truth that we cannot do
   some things which others can do well, just as the fig tree cannot bear
   olives though the olive tree growing close beside it is laden with the
   precious oily berries!

   This fact ought also to promote in us brotherly admiration. It is one
   of the most beautiful exhibitions of a Christian spirit when a
   Christian man admires the gifts and graces of others more than he
   admires his own! When, instead of thinking of anything in which he
   excels others, he delights in those things in which they excel him. We
   ought to emulate the spirit of that noble Roman who, when he was beaten
   at an election, said he was glad that his country had so many better
   men than himself. It is not always easy to feel, "I am happy in knowing
   of a Brother who is so much more brilliant than I am, for the world
   sadly needs far more light than I can give." It is not always easy to
   play the least important instrument in the band and to rejoice that
   somebody else can beat the big drum, or blow the silver cornet, yet
   that ought to be our feeling. You remember how prettily Bunyan speaks
   of Christiana and Mercy admiring each other after they had been in the
   bath--"They could not see that glory, each one on herself, which they
   could see in each other. Now, therefore, they began to esteem each
   other better than themselves. 'For you are fairer than I am, said one.
   And you are more comely than I am,' said another." So should Christians
   see and admire the work of the Spirit in other Christians and should
   bless God

   that there are such gracious men and women in the world! While those
   who are thus admired should, in their turn, see greater excellence in
   others than they see in themselves.

   And once more, this variety of gifts and graces helps to foster
   fellowship. I often feel, when I am conversing with some of the poorest
   and feeblest members of this Church, that I am greatly profited by what
   they say to me. They usually speak very kindly concerning the comfort
   they receive from my preaching and the advice I am able to give them
   when they come to see me. But I am certain that I derive benefit from
   them! It is impossible for two Christian men or women who are in a
   right state of heart, to converse with one another about the things of
   God without both of them being thereby spiritually enriched! As
   different countries have different products, and one nation sends its
   produce to supply the needs of another nation and thus, by mutual
   exchange, commerce is created and each nation's wealth is increased, so
   is it in spiritual things. You with your olives and this Brother with
   his figs, and that other Brother with his clusters of grapes will
   interchange your various fruits and all of you will benefit by the
   transaction! It is a great blessing for a bold and confident Believer
   to have a talk with a trembling, desponding Christian--and the poor
   timid soul will be strengthened by coming into contact with the more
   fully established saint. The man who has a very sweet disposition is
   apt to develop a sugariness which is most nauseating, so it will do him
   good to meet with a Christian who is very straightforward and
   outspoken--while that Brother--by associating with the more gentle
   spirit, may be kept from becoming too rough and coarse. I need not
   multiply instances of this helpful fellowship beyond just reminding you
   of how often, in God's mercy, a Christian husband and wife are the
   counterpart and complement of one another, so that what is lacking in
   one of them is supplied by the other and vice versa--and thus they both
   become the better, the holier, the happier and the more useful in the
   service of their Lord!

   II. Now, in the second place I am going to take the text more nearly in
   the way in which it was used by the Apostle. "Can the fig tree, my
   brethren, bear olives?" No. IT WOULD BE ALTOGETHER CONTRARY TO ITS
   NATURE.

   It would be a monstrosity, a thing to be wondered at and stared at as
   unnatural and absurd if a fig tree started bearing olives! And it is
   just as unnatural for a Christian to live in sin. Can he so live as to
   bear the fruits of iniquity instead of the fruits of righteousness? God
   forbid that it should be so! If the fig tree should ever bring forth
   olives, we might have good reason to question whether it was a fig
   tree, for a tree is known by its fruits. So, when one who professes to
   be a Christian lives as worldings live, there is grave reason to fear
   that he is a worldling, notwithstanding his profession! If we are to
   know him by his fruits, which is our Lord's Infallible test, how can we
   imagine that he is a partaker of the Divine Life when he acts as he
   does? Inconsistency of life casts a very serious doubt upon many who
   call themselves the children of God. No wonder they are, themselves,
   often the subjects of doubts and fears--as they ought to be--for if
   they judge themselves by their fruits, they may well question whether
   they have ever been born-again! Those who are new creatures in Christ
   Jesus seek to live as He lived as far as it is possible for them to do
   so.

   Besides, if a man for a while brings forth the fruits of righteousness
   and then bears the fruits of iniquity, he casts a slur upon all his
   former goodness. Suppose I saw a fig tree bearing olives and its owner
   assured me that it bore figs last year? I would say, "Well, I should
   not think the figs were worth much to judge from the look of those
   olives." So, when a man is in a passion and makes use of very strong
   language, perhaps even cursing and swearing as Peter did, one naturally
   asks, "Can that man ever have been a Christian?" "Well," says someone
   who knows him, "he used to speak very kindly and lovingly, and seemed
   to be a sincere Christian." That may have been the case with him, but
   it is a poor sort of Christianity that can even occasionally produce
   such iniquity! May God save all of us from bearing two kinds of fruit
   in this unnatural and dishonoring fashion! Suppose the whole Church of
   God should act thus and at one time be eminent for holiness and at
   another time be notorious for sin--what would be the consequence?
   Suppose, for instance, that certain people were very particular about
   their attendance at public worship and yet were known to frequent the
   theater? Would it not be a strange state of things? Should we judge
   them to be Christians or worldlings? If a man is sometimes a sinner and
   sometimes a saint, we would need to have an almanac to tell us which he
   was likely to be, or a tide-table to let us know whether, like the
   tides of the sea, he was ebbing or flowing! Think, too, what the
   consequences would be to such a man if he were to die--or if the Lord
   were to come just when he was bearing the fruits of unrighteousness!

   I am only imagining a monstrous case--such a case as must not be ours.
   O my dear Friends, let it never be so with you! If God is God, serve
   Him and follow Him! Or if the devil is God, serve him--but to try to
   serve God and the devil at the same time is to attempt a compromise
   that God abhors and which even Satan is not mean enough to approve!
   Even his disciples laugh to scorn those inconsistent professors who
   seek to serve God and mammon and to walk, at the same time, in the
   narrow way that leads unto life and in the broad road that leads to
   destruction! The other day I saw a man trying to walk on both sides of
   the street at once. Of course, he was drunk and whenever I see a man
   trying, spiritually, to do the same sort of thing--attempting to serve
   God and to serve the devil, too--I know that he is intoxicated, or
   infatuated under a fatal delusion, or he would never imagine that such
   a combination could be possible! Oil and water will not mix, nor light
   and darkness, nor saintliness and worldliness--you must have one or the
   other, you cannot have both at once, so "choose this day whom you will
   serve," Christ or Belial--you cannot serve both, for "no servant can
   serve two masters." The true Church of Christ is "fair as the moon,
   clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners." But an
   inconsistent church, a double-dealing church, a worldly church, (what
   an anomaly)--a church that holds with the hare and runs with the
   hounds, a church that makes a great profession but has little or
   nothing worth having in possession--such a church is the scorn of the
   world, a mere blown-up football for men and devils to kick wherever
   they will!

   An unholy man or woman who pretends to be a Christian is a stench in
   the nostrils of the thrice-holy God and a byword and reproach among
   those who make no pretense of being the Lord's. How can you rebuke sin
   in others while you are living in it, yourself? How can you preach the
   Christ whom you dishonor in your daily life? How can you reprove
   worldliness when you are, yourself, worldly? We speak with contempt of
   Satan rebuking sin and of the pot calling the kettle black, so if in
   any degree any of us have been guilty of this great crime against God,
   may we now sincerely repent of our sin and may the sanctifying Grace of
   the Holy Spirit preserve us from such evil walking for all time to
   come!

   III. Now, thirdly--and this is the point upon which I want most
   strongly to insist--IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A FIG TREE TO BEAR OLIVES--and
   it is impossible for an unconverted man to produce the fruits of
   righteousness! That is a task which is altogether beyond his power. The
   real text of this last division of my sermon is this--

   "YOU MUST BE BORN-AGAIN." Unless you are regenerated, born from above
   by a new and heavenly birth, you are not Christians, whatever you may
   be called, and you cannot produce the fruit which is acceptable to God
   any more than a fig tree can produce olives.

   Let us suppose that we are in the South of France and that we are
   standing by a fine fig tree. We want to make it bring forth olives and
   we will, for the sake of my argument, imagine that it is quite willing
   to do so--how shall we go to work?

   Well, first, let us label the fig tree, "OLIVE TREE." Get a label,
   write the word, "olive tree," on it and hang it on the fig tree. We
   have done that, entered its name on the list of olive trees, and when
   the next olive season comes round, we will bring our basket and gather
   the olives. At the appointed time, we do come, but what do we find? I
   cannot see an olive on the tree! There are fig leaves and figs, but
   nothing else. Ah, but we called it an olive tree! Yes, but calling it
   an olive tree did not change its nature, for it is still a fig tree!
   And calling a person a child of God will never make that person really
   be a child of God! I remember reading of someone being taught to speak
   of "my Baptism wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God
   and an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven." And if I recollect,
   rightly, that expression is often used by those who do not show any
   sign of having been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and adopted into the
   family of God! It is just a case of hanging a label on them--their
   nature remains the same as it was when they were born and, by nature
   they are children of wrath! Persons are said to be Christians because
   "they were born in a Christian country." I have often heard and read
   that England is a Christian country, but I have never seen any evidence
   of the truth of that title! Though there are some Christians in
   England, as there are some in India, China, Africa and other countries
   which no one regards as Christian! Yet according to some people, all
   Englishman are Christians, though some of them never enter a place of
   worship and others are drunk every night in the week--and many do not
   even believe in the existence of God! To call a horse an angel will not
   make him an angel. And to call a man a Christian will not make him a
   Christian. You may label, enroll, number the unsaved as much as you
   like, but you will not make even one of them a Christian by that
   process any more than putting the name, "olive tree," on a fig tree
   will change its nature and make it produce olives!

   As re-naming the fig tree is no use, let us try to trim it to the shape
   of an olive tree. That will not be an easy task, for the two trees bear
   very slight resemblance to one another. Still, we will see what we can
   do with axe, knife and shears, to make the fig tree look like an olive
   tree. When we come again, at the proper season, to gather the olives,
   how many shall we find? Not one, though we search diligently from the
   trunk to the topmost branch. If we have not ruined the tree by

   our cutting and shaping, we may find figs on it, but we shall gather no
   olives! So we may be very careful in trying to shape our children's
   lives and characters. We may teach them to be truthful, honest,
   upright, amiable, heroic and so on--and we may succeed so far that some
   of them may even look like young Christians! But if the Grace of God
   has not made them to be new creatures in Christ Jesus, all our
   training, trimming, shaping and directing will leave them unsaved and
   we shall then search in vain to find in them, "the fruit of the
   Spirit." There is far more needed than anything we can do! There must
   be a deeper, more enduring work than making them look and act like
   Christians--there must be a Divine work in the heart, a complete change
   of nature which can only be worked by the effectual working of the Holy
   Spirit!

   In our next attempt to get olives from the fig tree, we will treat the
   fig tree as if it were an olive tree. When at Men-tone, I have often
   noticed the men in the olive gardens digging a trench all round the
   trees and filling it with old rags and, somehow, the trees seem to draw
   suitable nutriment out of that strange sort of manure. Very well then,
   let us treat our fig tree in the same fashion and dig about it and
   fertilize it with all the old rags we can find. We do so and wait
   patiently for the result--and then we discover that we have wasted all
   those precious bales of rags which might have made the olive trees
   bring forth an abundant crop, for there is not an olive on the fig tree
   and probably even fewer figs than it would have produced if we had
   given it the nourishment suited to its nature! So you may take your
   young people and treat them as if they were Christians and do all that
   you can to nourish the Divine Life that has not yet entered their
   souls--but all your efforts will be in vain, for you cannot give them
   new natures--you cannot make the children of Adam into the children of
   God! You will do far more lasting good by entreating the Lord to
   accomplish the great work of Grace which is altogether beyond your
   power--and by teaching each unsaved one, old or young, to pray David's
   prayer--"Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit
   within me."

   Here is our fig tree without a single olive on it! Now let us surround
   it with olive treesand see what a change that will make in it. The tree
   is very lonely where it is, so we will see what helpful associations
   will do for it. It will be another difficult task for us, but we will
   not shirk it, for we are determined to transplant it right into the
   middle of an olive gar-den--and we will tie it up to a fruitful olive
   tree and then, when it has no other trees near it, surely it must bear
   olives! But will it? Oh no--when the time of figs arrives, it will bear
   figs unless we have destroyed its fruit-bearing power by disturbing
   it--but there will be no olives on it except those that fall among its
   branches when the tree by its side is beaten to yield up its thousands
   of purple, oily berries. So here is an unconverted man right in the
   midst of Christian people! He is not very comfortable, for he feels
   that he is out of his element. He would be much more at home in a
   public house or at a music hall, or at home reading a novel or the
   newspaper--yet here he is surrounded by Christians. Possibly, like the
   fig tree tied to an olive tree, the man is united to a godly wife, yet
   it is not enough to make him a Christian. He has a gracious, loving
   daughter--she has persuaded him to come with her tonight in the hope
   that he may get a blessing here, as I most sincerely hope he may. But,
   my dear Friend, let me tell you that it is not sufficient for you to
   have a Christian wife, or Christian children, or Christian parents
   unless there is a work of Gracewithin your own heart--unless your very
   nature is changed by the Holy Spirit so that you are made a new
   creature in Christ Jesus! All these hallowed relationships and
   associations will only increase your condemnation! I must repeat to you
   Paul's message to the Philippian jailor, "Believe on the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and you shall be saved." And very likely it will then be
   possible to add in your case as in his, "and your house." God grant
   that it may be so!

   Now suppose we take that fig tree to the top of a hill, like the Mount
   of Olives, and plant it there?It is still a fig tree and it brings
   forth nothing but figs! Yes, and if the Lord were to take an
   unconverted man up to Heaven, just as he is, he would remain
   unconverted even there. Unless and until he was born-again, the mere
   change of place, even from earth to Heaven, would not make him
   acceptable to God! He would be like that man without the wedding
   garment--and the King would say to his servants, "Bind him, hand and
   foot, and take him away and cast him into outer darkness; there shall
   be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

   Perhaps someone asks, "But, Sir, what is it to be born-again?" Well, it
   is nota mere outward change of life. It is not simply a giving up of
   certain sins and a desire to possess certain virtues. It is as great a
   work as if you were to be annihilated--to pass absolutely out of
   existence--and God were to make a new man in your place! Everyone who
   is in Christ Jesus is a new creation--old things have passed away and
   all things have become new.

   "But can such a change as that be worked?" asks an anxious enquirer.
   "It would be a glorious thing for me if it could be worked in me." Yes,
   my Friend, it can be done by the Almighty Spirit and if you are ever to
   be found in the Presence of God in Glory, this change must be worked in
   you! I am speaking to some of you who have been very moral and
   admirable from your youth up, yet you have never experienced a saving
   change of heart, so to you I must repeat those solemn words of the Lord
   Jesus, "Except you are converted and become as little children, you
   shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven."

   "Well," says some self-satisfied person, "I feel quite good enough
   already." Ah, that is the very strongest possible proof that you are
   not good enough. Do you remember the people, in our Lord's lifetime on
   earth, who thought they were good enough, and do you recollect what
   Jesus said concerning their righteousness? "I say unto you, That except
   your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
   Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven." And
   that is what He says to you who think you are good enough. The man who
   has been born-again confesses with sorrow and shame that he has no
   goodness of his own--and he ascribes all that is good in him to the
   Almighty Grace of God, alone. With Toplady, he sings--

   "Because Your Sovereign Love

   Was bent the worst to save--

   Jesus who reigns enthroned above,

   The free salvation gave."

   "Ah," says another friend, "but if that is true, it makes my case so
   hopeless." That is just what I want you to feel, so that you may look
   right away from yourself and look alone unto Jesus! You cannot
   regenerate yourself any more than that which is not in existence can
   create itself! It must be a work that is accomplished by Omnipotence
   and, therefore, no power less than that which is Divine can accomplish
   it. So you are obliged to acknowledge your absolute dependence upon the
   Grace of God. If He leaves you to yourself, you will be most certainly
   lost--and He is not bound by anything but the love of His own heart to
   interpose to rescue you. Therefore if, in His Infinite Sovereignty, as
   King of Mercy and of Grace, He deigns to smile upon you and to create
   you anew in Christ Jesus, you will have reason to praise and bless Him
   forever and ever, will you not? That is the point to which I want to
   bring you so that you will admit that if you are ever saved, it will be
   all of God's Grace and all God's work from first to last!

   "Oh, that I had this new birth!" cries one. That very wish, if it is
   the sincere desire and prayer of your heart, may be the first evidence
   that you have already been born-again, even as the Lord's testimony
   concerning Saul of Tarsus, "Behold, he prays," proved that he had
   already uttered the first cry of a newborn child of God! Remember that
   text which the Lord blessed to my conversion so many years ago, "Look
   unto Me, and be you saved all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and
   there is none else"--and do as I did, then--look and live! Look this
   very instant, by faith, to Jesus hanging on the Cross of Calvary, for--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for thee-- Then look, Sinner--look unto Him and be saved-- Unto
   Him who was nailed to the tree."

   If you will do this, that faith-look of yours will be the evidence that
   this new life is already pulsating within you! And as this life is
   everlasting life, you have received that life which neither devils nor
   men can ever take away from you. "He that believes on the Son has
   everlasting life," and no man ever truly believed on Jesus and yet
   remained unregenerate! Faith in Christ is one of the first signs and
   tokens of the new life within the soul. If I find on you even one
   olive, I know that it has the oil of Grace within it and that is proof
   positive that you are one of the good olive trees in the garden of the
   Lord! If I found figs on you, I would know that you were a fig tree.
   But if I find only one little olive, I know that the hidden life that
   can produce one olive can produce bushels of the same sort and even
   larger and richer ones, to the praise and glory of the great Owner of
   the olive garden in which you have been planted by His own right hand!
   The little feeble faith that You have already exercised is the gift of
   God--and under the gracious nurture of His Ever-Blessed Spirit, it will
   grow until you are, like Abraham, "strong in faith, giving glory to
   God."

   May the Lord enable you to have done with yourself and to have begun
   with Him! The end of the creature is the beginning of the Creator. When
   you acknowledge that you cannot save yourself and trust Him to save
   you, He will do it! Cast yourself upon Him this very moment and then,
   by an act of Almighty Grace, the fig tree shall be changed into a
   fruitful olive tree and your fruit shall be unto holiness--and the end
   everlasting life!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 56; 57.

   Psalm 56:1. Be merciful unto me, O God, for man would swallow me up.
   Fighting all day he oppresses me. "Man has no mercy upon me, but, O
   God, be You merciful to me! If Your Justice does for a while let my
   enemies loose upon me, let Your mercy diminish their power over me, for
   they are very cruel. They would make a complete end of me if they
   could, utterly devouring me."

   2-4. My enemies would daily swallow me up: for they are many that fight
   against me, O most High What time I am afraid, I will trust in You. In
   God I will praise His Word. David means, "Through His Grace, I will
   praise His Word," for we cannot rightly praise God unless He gives us
   the Grace to do it. To receive from God is most easy for us, but to
   return gratitude to God is impossible except as His Grace enables us to
   do it. "In God I will praise His Word."

   4, 5. In God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to
   me. Every day they twist my words. This is a common calamity of God's
   servants and a common crime of the oppressors of God's people in all
   ages--"They twist my words."

   5, 6. All their thoughts are against me for evil They gather themselves
   together, theyhide themselves, theymarkmy steps when they wait for my
   soul."They watch to see if they can find some matter of accusation
   against me, or some opportunity for tempting me to turn aside from my
   God. 'They mark my steps,' as the huntsman follows the trail of the
   lion he seeks to kill, so they follow my tracks to see if by any means
   they may slay me."

   7, 8. Shall they escape by iniquity? In Your anger cast down the
   people, O God. You number my wanderings. David's was a life of
   wandering, from the sheep-folds to his father's house, then to the
   palace of Saul, then to the camp of Israel, then to the palace, again,
   then to the cave Adullam, then among the Philistines--I scarcely
   remember all the places where he went, but there were at least 12 great
   changes in David's life. And God had them all written down and so He
   has all yours, you who believe in Jesus--all your wanderings are
   recorded because God sets a high value upon everything that happens to
   you! Not a sparrow falls to the ground without being noticed by Him,
   and not a single step is taken by you without being noted by Him.

   8. Put You my tears into Your bottle.This is thought by some to have
   been an allusion to an old Roman custom of catching the tears of the
   friends of the dying in a lachrymatory, or small bottle, and then
   burying them in their tomb. I see no reason to believe that David meant
   anything so absurd! There is probably a very much better meaning than
   that to be attached to these words. Bottles, large capacious bottles,
   were used to catch the copious drops which streamed forth from the
   wine-press and David felt that his tears would be, in God's sight, as
   precious and as plentiful as the grape drops, and that a great bottle
   would be needed to hold them--such a bottle as the Jews used for
   holding milk or wine. Though his soul suffered much sorrow, he believed
   God would treasure it all up--"Put You my tears into Your bottle."

   8. Are they not in Your Book?"Are they not all duly recorded there?"

   9. When I cry unto You, then shall my enemies turn back. "When I cry,
   they shall fly, so swift is prayer to reach the ear and heart of God!
   And so kind is God to me."

   9-12. This Iknow; for God is for me. In God will Ipraise His Word: in
   the LORD willIpraise His Word. In God have I put my trust I will not be
   afraid what man can do unto me. Your vows are upon me, O God. "I am
   bound to praise You, I am bound to love You and I will, come what may."

   12, 13. I will render praises unto You. For You have delivered my soul
   from death: will You not deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk
   before God in the light of the living?

   Psalm 57:1. Be merciful unto me, O God. He begins with the same note as
   in the last Psalm. It is a note that cannot be too often on the
   Believer's tongue--"Be merciful unto me, O God."

   1. Be merciful unto me. As an old writer says, "The tongue of the bell
   strikes on both sides, and the note is the same in each case, 'Be
   merciful unto me, be merciful unto me.'" You cannot have that petition
   offered too often! David feels his deep need of mercy and the great
   value of mercy and, therefore, he prays again and again, "Be merciful
   unto me, be merciful unto me."

   1, 2. For my soul trusts in You: yes, in the shadow of Your wings will
   I make my refuge, until these calamities have passed over me. I will
   cry unto God Most High; unto God that performs all things for me. "That
   perfects all things for

   me," so it may be read. "That perfects all His mercies, all His
   promises--and who will perfect all that concerns me whatever it may
   be--unto this God will I cry."

   3-5. He shall send from Heaven, and save me from the reproach of him
   that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth His mercy andHis
   truth. My soulis among lions: andllie even among them that are set on
   fire, even the sons ofmen whose teeth are spears andarrows, and their
   tongue a sharp sword. Be You exalted, O God, above the heavens; let
   Your Glory be above all the earth. "Exalt Yourself by overcoming all
   Your enemies. If they are very great, be You greater still. If they are
   mighty, be You the more mighty in my defense and so glorify Your holy
   name."

   6-11. They have prepared a net for my steps, my soul is bowed down:
   they have dug a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen
   themselves. Selah. My heart is fixed. God, my heart is fixed: I
   willsing and give praise. Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery andharp: I
   myself will awake early. I willpraise You, OLord, among thepeople: I
   willsing unto You among the nations. For Your mercy is great unto the
   heavens and Your truth unto the clouds. Be You exalted, O God, above
   the heavens; let Your Glory be above all the earth.

The Secret of Happiness

   (No. 3227)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 2,
   1872.

   "Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you." Matthew 9:2.

   [Other Sermons by Mr. Spurgeon concerning the man sick of the palsy are
   as follows--#2337, Volume 39--THE PHYSICIAN PARDONS HIS PALSIED
   PATIENT; #2417, Volume 41--FIRST FORGIVENESS, THEN HEALING and #3016,
   Volume52--GOOD CHEER FROM FORGIVEN SIN.]

   OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST did not say to the palsied man, "Be of good
   cheer, your palsied limbs shall be made strong and well again." But
   before He had cured that terrible malady, He bade him be comforted
   because his sins were forgiven--as if that would be a sufficient reason
   for rejoicing even if he should remain palsied! If he should be carried
   away from the Presence of Christ upon his bed just as helpless as when
   he was let down from the roof into the middle of the crowded room, that
   would be quite a secondary matter compared with the all-important fact
   that his sins had been forgiven. David truly wrote, "Blessed is he
   whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered," and he is
   blessed even though he is sick of the palsy, or suffering from all the
   diseases to which flesh is heir! You remember, too, how the Prophet
   Isaiah wrote, under the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit, "Comfort, you,
   comfort you My people, says your God. Speak you comfortably to
   Jerusalem, and cry unto her"--what? What shall be the special cause of
   comfort to the Church of God?--"that her warfare is accomplished, that
   her iniquity is pardoned." She might be in great trouble and distress.
   Her land might be trodden under the feet of invaders. Her sons and
   daughters might be fainting in her streets, but as her iniquity was
   pardoned, she had good ground for comfort! To quote another instance
   that is a close parallel to our text, our Lord said to the woman in the
   city who was a sinner--who had washed His feet with her tears and wiped
   them with the hairs of her head, and kissed them, and anointed them
   with ointment--"Your sins are forgiven...Go in peace." And, truly, when
   sin is forgiven, we may go in peace!

   This is the subject upon which I am going to speak--whatever there may
   be to cause us sorrow, if our sins are forgiven, we have good reason to
   be happy. First, I shall try to show you that the pardon of sin brings
   true happiness. Next, that those whose sins are forgiven ought to be
   happy. And thirdly, a solemn warning in conclusion that there is no
   true happiness for unpardoned souls.

   I. First, then, as Jesus said to the man sick of the palsy, "Son, be of
   good cheer; your sins are forgiven you," we learn

   that THE PARDON OF SIN BRINGS TRUE HAPPINESS.

   Time would fail us to show all the ways in which the forgiveness of sin
   is a perennial fountain of consolation, but note, first, that it is one
   of the surest signs ofDivine favor--anyone who is in the enjoyment of
   it, certainly has abundant reason for being glad! God may give a man
   great riches, but that would not, in itself, be a token of favor. It
   might even be quite the opposite! God may give a man great success in
   his enterprises, but that, also, may be no evidence of favor. God may
   even permit a man to have his heart's desire and to be filled with this
   world's follies and pleasures--yet that might be a proof of Divine
   wrath rather than of the Lord's favor. He may have said concerning him,
   "Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone." But if a man's sins are
   forgiven, there is no doubt about God's favor in his case!. That brief
   sentence, "Your sins are forgiven," is a clearer token of the favor of
   God than vats bursting with new wine or barns packed to the roof with
   golden grain! If your sins are forgiven you, you have the King's
   guarantee to prove that He loves you!

   Forgiveness of sin is also a proof of Divine Election--not merely a
   sign and token of God's present, favorable regard, but an evidence of
   that ancient favor which God had in His heart towards His chosen even
   from eternity! There are

   many common mercies that God gives freely to all sorts and conditions
   of men. "He makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
   sends rain on the just and on the unjust." But the pardon of sin is a
   special blessing reserved for His own peculiar people, whose names He
   wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life and whom He gave to His Son in the
   Covenant of His Grace--and whom Christ reclaimed by His precious blood
   when He "loved the Church and gave Himself for it." These are the
   people in whom God takes a peculiar delight--and these are they whose
   sins are forgiven them for Christ's sake!

   If you, my Brother or Sister, are one of these highly-favored ones,
   then you have good reason to be happy! Think for a minute or two upon
   what this pardon is, and then you will see what cause you have for
   happiness. Isaiah tells us that Jehovah has laid upon Christ the
   iniquity of all His people so that this crushing burden has been
   removed from all of us who are truly His--and surely he who has had
   such a load taken off his heart and conscience must be a happy man! In
   Psalm 85:2, we read, "You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people,
   You have covered all their sin." If we have believed in Jesus, our sins
   are covered even from the sight of God by the Propitiatory Sacrifice of
   Christ, and they are so concealed from our own eyes that we no longer
   think of them as condemning us! Can any of us realize that this is our
   case and yet remain unhappy? In Isaiah 44:22, we read, "I have blotted
   out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions and, as a cloud, your sins."
   You have sometimes seen the clouds dissipated and scattered so
   completely that not a vestige of them can be seen--that is how our sins
   are driven away by God--so shall we not be happy? Sometimes the pardon
   of sin is called the casting of sin behind God's back into the depths
   of the sea. At another time it is said that, "the iniquity of Israel
   shall be sought for and there shall be none. And the sins of Judah, and
   they shall not be found." And then there is that wonderful description
   of the work of "Messiah the Prince" which Gabriel gave to Daniel, "to
   finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins." What stronger
   expression than that could ever be used? If it is Christ's work "to
   make an end of sins," we may be quite sure that He will do it and that
   there will be an end of them for all who believe in Him! Therefore let
   our hearts dance for joy as His gracious Spirit assures us that our
   sins are as completely annihilated and put away as if they had never
   been committed!

   Observe, also, that the pardon of sin completely changes a man's
   position in relation to God. Before he was forgiven, he was in the
   position of a condemned man--the wrath of God was abiding upon him. If
   his conscience had been awakened and enlightened by the Holy Spirit, he
   felt that the sword of Divine Justice was drawn from its sheath and
   hanging over his head as by a single hair. I remember well the time
   when neither night nor day had I either peace or comfort. I knew that
   God must be angry with me because of my sin and that I was, "condemned
   already," because I had not savingly believed on His only-begotten Son.
   But the moment a man's sins are forgiven, his spirit begins to rejoice
   in God, his Savior! Then his days are full of peace and he can fall
   asleep at night without fearing death, even should the silent messenger
   come for him before he wakes! He is no longer the slave of sin and
   Satan, but a free man in Christ Jesus! He is no longer a rebel, hiding
   here and there to avoid arrest by the officers of Divine Justice, but
   he is welcomed as the King's own son and received with loving embraces
   into his Father's bosom! Surely there is no greater comfort under
   Heaven than a sense of sin forgiven and of reconciliation to God by the
   death of His Son! An earthly courtier whose whole life at court depends
   upon his monarch's favor, feels that if his sovereign frowns upon him,
   his position is imperiled and all his joy has departed. But when he
   again basks in the sunshine of his sovereign's smile because his
   offense has been forgiven, then is his life once more filled with
   happiness. Even so is it with us--in past days, we were under the frown
   of our great Lord and King and we were in utter misery--almost in
   despair. But now that His smile rests upon us and He has forgiven us
   all our transgressions, we can sing, yes, and even dance for joy of
   heart that our sins and iniquities He will remember against us no more,
   forever!

   The pardon of sin also makes a change in all that surrounds the one who
   is forgiven. That is a terrible text of Scripture, "I will curse your
   blessings: yes, I have cursed them already," and many a man has
   realized in his own life the truth of that Divine declaration! The
   whole world, as far as it is loyal to its great Creator, is against the
   man who is the enemy of God, even as the stars in their courses fought
   against Sisera. But to the man who is at peace with God we can say, as
   Eliphaz said to Job, "You shall be in league with the stones of the
   field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you." Paul
   was not a whit too positive when he wrote, "We know that all things
   work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the
   called according to His purpose." Deliverance from sins seems, to the
   forgiven man, to cause such a change in everything around him that the
   things which he used to regard as curses now appear to him as

   blessings, just as before his blessings (as he called them) were
   transmuted into curses! Blessed is the man who has had his sins
   forgiven! He is the man who can truly say, "The winter is past, the
   rain is over and done; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the
   singing of birds is come." And it is to him and others like he that the
   Lord says, "You shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace: the
   mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and
   all the trees of the field shall clap their hands." The saved man is
   such a happy man that like John Bunyan, when he was converted, he
   wanted even the crows in the field to share his joy!

   In the pardon of sin, too, blessed be God, there is a reversal of the
   sentence which had been pronounced upon us as sinners. As I speak of
   this great fact, I cannot help remembering the time when I would have
   cheerfully given my eyes, or anything else that was dear to me, if I
   might but have been assured that my sins were all forgiven. The dread
   of the wrath to come filled my spirit and I knew not how soon I might
   be summoned to appear before the bar of God to hear the sentence that
   my sins had merited. I felt that I would willingly lie in prison and
   have nothing but bread and water for my sustenance if I might only have
   my sins blotted out. And now, trusting to the atoning Sacrifice of
   Christ, I know that my sins are all forgiven for His sake, I find my
   tongue quite inadequate to tell of the joys I have experienced and
   still feel through knowing that the sentence justly passed upon me has
   been reversed! So now, instead of fearing that the messengers of Divine
   Justice will arrest me and drag me off to the eternal prison, I join in
   Paul's triumphant challenge to Heaven, earth and Hell, and cry, "Who
   shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
   justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yes,
   rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
   also makes intercession for us." There is no Hell for a pardoned
   sinner! God may chasten him as his loving Father, but He will never
   condemn as his Judge. No penal wrath can fall upon him, for it is
   contrary to Jehovah's righteous rule to punish those whom He has
   absolved. The day of wrath has passed for him and his portion is now
   unspeakable joy and bliss which will culminate in indescribable bliss
   and glory forever and ever!

   Sometimes--and it is true in the case we are now considering, when
   persons who have been disgraced for high treason have been pardoned by
   their sovereign, the disgrace is removed and their estates, which had
   been sequestered, are restored to them and, in like manner, all that we
   had lost by our treason against the Most High is restored to us. It is
   true that we find not a literal earthly paradise such as Adam had, but
   we can walk with God quite a closely as he ever did and in the Person
   of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, we can have closer communion with
   God than our first father enjoyed in his unfallen state! Our soul has
   fruits to feed upon such as Adam never tasted! We drink from a fountain
   whose streams are more precious than the river that watered the Garden
   of Eden! In fact, as we often sing--

   "In Christ, the sons of Adam boast, More blessings than their father
   lost." Christ has restored to us all that we lost by sin and has added
   new blessings which Adam never had. So that now, as Dr. Watts truly
   wrote--

   "All things are ours--the gifts of God-- The purchase of a Savior's
   blood While the good Spirit show's us how To use and to improve them,
   too."

   Or, as Paul wrote under the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit, "All things
   are yours; whether...the world, or life, or death, on things present,
   or things to come, all are yours and you are Christ's and Christ is
   God's."

   I will only mention one other thing that clearly shows that the pardon
   of sin brings true happiness. It is this. To many of us, it is the
   greatest joy we know to be able to do anything that brings glory to God
   and extends His Kingdom on earth. But, Beloved Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ, we could not have done this if our sins had remained
   unforgiven! We would have been incapable of proclaiming the Gospel to
   others if we had not proved its sweetness ourselves. I always feel that
   I can make Paul's language my own and say, "Unto me, who am less than
   the least of all saints, is this Grace given, that I should preach
   among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ." Many of you, my
   Brothers, can say the same. Others of you can apply the spirit of the
   Apostle's words to your Sunday school teaching, your house to house
   visitation, your tract distribution, or any other form of service by
   which you seek to win souls for Christ and so to bring glory to God! It
   is most blessed work in which you are engaged, but you could never
   rightly have engaged in it if you had not yourself first enjoyed the
   blessedness of the man "whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
   covered." What is

   there of Covenant blessing, what is there of experimental godliness,
   what is there of fellowship with God, what is there of foretaste of the
   eternal bliss that we could have known if, first of all, the Lord had
   not forgiven us all our iniquities? This, which is, in itself, a choice
   blessing, includes many other choice blessings and, therefore, it
   should make all those who possess it supremely happy!

   II. The second part of my sermon is an application of the first
   part--what I have been saying to you is true, therefore carry it out!
   Which means that THOSE WHOSE SINS ARE FORGIVEN OUGHT TO BE HAPPY.

   First, of all, is it not most becoming that they should be
   happy?Remember our Savior's parable of the prodigal son? He comes home
   in rags, but he is lovingly welcomed by his father's warm embrace and
   fond kisses. His rags are taken off and the best robe is put in their
   place! The fatted calf is killed and there is general rejoicing
   throughout the house! Now imagine, if you can, this newly-received
   prodigal sitting down and weeping amid the joy of all around him. I can
   conceive that his tears flowed copiously enough at first--when he found
   himself so graciously forgiven and was made to feel that he was at home
   once more--yet, surely even those must have been mainly tears of joy
   though some bitter drops of grief for the past wasted years must have
   been mingled with them! I think that day he could not even have a
   headache for the joy of his heart must have driven away all his aches
   and pains! And if, before, he had been footsore and weary with his long
   journey from the far country, the exhilaration and delight of such a
   homecoming must have revived and refreshed him! When "they began to be
   merry," surely there was not one there who was happier than he was!
   And, beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, we are in the same
   position as he was! Now that God has pardoned us, shall we sit as
   mourners at the great Gospel feast to which we have been so lovingly
   welcomed? Angels are rejoicing over us! Shall we be moaning and
   groaning, sighing and crying, murmuring and complaining? All our fellow
   Christians are glad to hear that we have tasted that the Lord is
   gracious--shall they rejoice over us and shall not we rejoice?

   "Oh, but, I am so poor!" says one. I am sorry it is so with you, my
   dear Friend, but shall a sense of your poverty have more power over
   your mind than a sense of God's forgiving love? "Ah, but I have a sick
   one at home!" sighs another. I admire your sympathetic feeling, but
   shall that be permitted to outweigh your feeling of gratitude to God
   for saving your soul from everlasting destruction? Is there anything in
   the world that is worthy to be compared with the incalculable mercy of
   forgiven sin? What if I am poor? Yet I am forgiven! What if I am
   sickly? Yet I am forgiven! What if I shall soon die? Yet I am forgiven!
   Our sin being forgiven, the very sting of death is drawn and,
   therefore, we can sing, "Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory
   through our Lord Jesus Christ!"

   Then next, have we not the very best reason for rejoicing John Bunyan
   rightly says that any man who wears the flower called "heart's ease" in
   his bosom is a happy man. But where does that flower grow except in the
   garden of forgiveness of sin? The heart is heavy when sin is resting
   upon it, but it is light and joyous when sin is removed. I would bear
   any affliction rather than be burdened with a guilty conscience--would
   not you, too, my Brothers and Sisters? As long as conscience is clear
   and cleansed, other matters are of small account and we need not fear
   even the devil himself. The principal element in true happiness is a
   heart at peace with God, and a pardoned sinner has that! Then ought he
   not to show it in his very face? Ought not his whole manner to be
   blessedly joyous because he is at peace with God? The Lord, Himself,
   says that such a man is blessed, and can His verdict be set at nothing?
   Shall He say that you are blessed because He has forgiven your
   transgression and covered your sin--and will you bow your head as if
   you were a bulrush and that He had forgotten you? When God's
   declaration is that those who are forgiven are blessed--and when He
   bids them be glad in Him and even shout for joy--it must be right for
   them to do as He commands! And it would be wrong for them not to do so!
   O you pardoned ones, pray the Lord to enable you to shake off the gloom
   that now enshrouds you and to give unto you "beauty for ashes, the oil
   ofjoy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness"!

   Ought we not to cultivate this blessed flower of true Scriptural
   happiness far more than we do? I find myself frequently depressed in
   spirit--perhaps more so than any other person here--and I find no
   better cure for that depression than to trust in the Lord with all my
   heart and seek to realize afresh the power of the peace-speaking blood
   of Jesus and His Infinite Love in dying upon the Cross to put away all
   my transgressions! As I gaze upon the Incarnate God there made sin for
   me, that I might be made the righteousness of God in Him, streams of
   comfort flow into my soul from His many wounds! I could sit at Calvary
   and weep, but I could not sit there without singing! It is strange, yet
   is it true that in the hour of our greatest grief, we soon find comfort
   in the place where grief reached its climax. Calvary was the very
   summit of sorrow for our dear Lord and Savior, yet it is the death of
   sorrow to His people! And the Cross which caused

   Him unspeakable agony, brings consolation and joy to all who put their
   trust in Him! If we meditated more upon what Christ did to procure
   peace and pardon for us, we would more fully rejoice over the
   Redemption that He bought for us when He gave "His life a ransom for
   many." And if we more clearly realized what the pardon of sin really
   means and how many other precious blessings are bound up in the same
   bundle with it--if we continually sought to live as pardoned men and
   women ought to live--we would find that nine out of ten of the things
   that depress us would be driven away like clouds before a Biscay gale!

   And mark, Beloved, that this source of joy will always abide with us.
   "Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you," is a message that
   always gives comfort and joy. While we are young, perhaps we are
   foolish enough to look elsewhere for happiness, but when we grow old
   and cares and sorrows increase, happy, indeed, are we if we have the
   happiness that comes from pardoned sin! If we are rich, we are apt to
   look to our wealth for consolation, but when we are brought down to
   penury, what a source of happiness it is to us if our sins are forgiven
   for Christ's sake! The Believer's sins are pardoned when he is most
   joyous on the top of Tabor, but they are equally pardoned when he is in
   Doubting Castle in the clutches of that grim old tyrant, Giant Despair!
   He who has once looked by faith to Jesus Christ and Him Crucified is
   pardoned anywhere--and pardoned everywhere, pardoned at all times--and
   pardoned under all circumstances! The comforts that spring out of
   growth in Grace, are variable, but the comfort which arises from the
   forgiveness of sin is always full, rich and true! If we are forgiven,
   we ought to be glad and rejoice all our days--and we should be
   specially joyful whenever the time comes for us to die! We need have no
   fear about departing out of this world, for we are not going into the
   Presence of an angry God, but to meet Him who has forgiven all our
   sins! We shall gather up our feet in the bed as some dear ones who were
   with us lately did when it was time for them to go--and we shall defy
   the last enemy and bravely pass through his dominions, not fearing
   arrest, there, because we have received that plenary absolution which
   is a passport even through the realm of death!

   If we enjoyed this happiness as we ought, I really do not know what
   there is that would distress us because the joy of being forgiven would
   override and overtop any sorrow that could come upon us in
   anyconceivable circumstances! Our sin being pardoned, there is no cause
   for our heart to be troubled. The greatest grief is gone, the
   master-sorrow is removed. Dear children of God, let me press upon you
   and also upon myself the duty of maintaining a sacred cheerfulness of
   spirit. Let not the men of the world be truthfully able to say of us
   that we are a sad and mournful lot of people! If any people under
   Heaven have a right to be happy, we have! When all the joys of this
   life grow dim, ours begin to burn more brightly. I can understand a man
   in business who only lives to make money, being crushed when he becomes
   a bankrupt. But I cannot understand your being like that, my dear
   Brother, if you live to glorify God in your business and in everything
   else! I can comprehend a worldly man saying, "I have nothing left on
   earth now that my darling is dead." But I cannot comprehend your saying
   it, my Brother or Sister, for your sins are forgiven! And now, however
   God may deal with you, His strokes are gentle and tender, not at all
   like those that you deserved to have when you were unrepentant and
   unforgiven! Let all of us who believe in Jesus not only ask that His
   joy may remain in us, but also that our joy may be full. I wish we
   could all be so calm, so confident in God, so joyous under all
   circumstances, that all around us would be compelled to ask, "What is
   the secret of these peoples' happiness? They have no immunity from
   trouble--they have as much to vex and annoy them as we have! What is it
   that makes them even glory in tribulation?" I wish they might often be
   obligated to ask that question, so that we could give this
   answer--"Those whose sins are forgiven ought always to be happy--that
   is the secret of our continual joy."

   III. Now we must close with the sorrowful reflection that FOR THE
   UNFORGIVEN, THERE IS NO TRUE HAPPINESS.

   An unconverted man may have what he calls, joy, but it is the joy of
   madness! If He were rational and thoughtful and saw things as they
   really are, he could not have any real joy as long as he remained
   unpardoned. Suppose, Sinner, you are in trouble. These are only the
   first drops before the great storm of Divine Wrath that awaits you! And
   that sickness of yours, that bereavement, that poverty--these are only
   the beginning of that awful hurricane that will break upon your devoted
   head! I cannot say to you, "Be of good cheer in your trouble," for
   there is worse trouble to come to you. "Many sorrows shall be to the
   wicked."

   Perhaps you tell me that you are not in trouble or, on the contrary,
   you are exceedingly prospering--everything you touch seems to turn to
   gold. You invite me to pay you a visit and are proud to show me over
   your princely mansion, your spacious grounds and your lovely gardens.
   But my principal thought is, "How will you like to leave all this?" As
   I see how anxious you are to add field to field, and farm to farm, I
   cannot help remembering what God said to a man who seemed to have been
   very much like you--"You fool! This night your soul shall be required
   of you; then whose shall these things be which you have provided?" What
   a terrible change it must have been for the "rich man, who was clothed
   in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day," when, "in
   Hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham afar
   off, and Lazarus in his bosom, and cried and said, Father Abraham, have
   mercy upon me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger
   in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame." And
   what a terrible change it would be for you, my Friend, to go from all
   your riches into Hell! Yet I do not know whether it makes much
   difference to you if you are rich or if you are poor so long as you are
   unforgiven!

   Possibly your heart is hardened and you mean to brazen it out before
   God and, like Belshazzar, you would even send for the sacred vessels
   out of the Temple and mingle blasphemy with your Bacchanalian
   festivities! Then I would remind you of the mysterious handwriting upon
   the wall, "TEKEL. You are weighed in the balance and are found
   wanting." You may be very bold just now, but before long you will be
   made to crouch in terror before God when He lifts up His rod to smite
   you! Whether you are hardened or not--whatever your condition may be--I
   see no road to happiness for you as long as you are unpardoned! There
   is nothing in life or in death, in time or in eternity, that can
   comfort a man whose sins are not forgiven! And there is nothing that
   you can ever do which will give you true comfort while you remain an
   unfor-given sinner. You may give up certain sins and make some sort of
   reformation, but as long as all your old sins continue unpardoned, you
   will not even have started on the right road! No, there is no hope for
   you until you fall prostrate before the Throne of God, confessing your
   guilt and beseeching His mercy! Do it now. Now, while He sits upon the
   Throne of Grace and stretches out to you the silver scepter of His
   mercy! Come and bow at His feet and cry, "O Lord, for Your dear Son's
   sake, blot out all my iniquities," and He will do it and do it now! If
   you will trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, now, you shall go out of this
   house perfectly forgiven--and in your soul you shall know that you are
   forgiven, for the Spirit of God shall bear witness with your spirit
   that it is so! Come, then, to the Fountain filled with precious
   blood--for there your sins can be all washed away!

   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved," and He will
   say to you as He said to the man sick of the palsy, "Be of good cheer;
   your sins are forgiven you." God grant that it may be so with many
   here, for Jesus sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM62.

   [The Exposition belonging to the above Sermon is too long for the space
   available so it has been transferred to Sermon #3228, (next sermon)
   Volume 56--"OH, HOW HE LOVES."]

   Verse 1. Truly my soul silently waits for God: from Him comes my
   salvatioi. Waiting upon God, if not true and sincere, is only a
   mockery. It is also an insult to the Lord and, so far from bringing us
   a blessing it would only bring us a curse! The Hebrew has it, "Truly my
   soul is silent before God," for faith asks no questions, raises no
   objections, starts no difficulties, but is content to wait quietly in
   God's time, believing that all will be well. David meant, "My soul in
   silence waits only upon God: from Him comes my salvation and from no
   other quarter--not from the Assyrians, nor from the Egyptians, nor from
   my own might or wisdom, but from God alone." I hope that we have not
   only come up to this service in our bodies, but that we have brought
   our souls, also, to wait upon God. It is unutterably sad when we go to
   a place of worship and leave our souls somewhere else. Soul-worship is
   the very soul of worship, but worship without the whole heart and soul
   is soulless and dead!

   2. He only is my rock and my salvation. [See Sermon #80, Volume 2--GOD
   ALONE THE SALVATION OF HIS PEOPLE.] He is my defense; I shall not be
   greatly moved. He may be moved as an old oak is moved in a storm--its
   branches are shaken, but its trunk stands fast--and its roots get all
   the firmer grip upon the soil! He may be moved like a ship which is
   tossed, but which still does not drag its anchor, so He can truly say,
   "I shall not be greatly moved."

   3. How long will you imagine attacking a man? You shall be slain, all
   of you. As a bowing wall shall you be, and as a tottering fence.
   David's enemies were very many, yet see how he speaks of their
   enmity--"How long will you imagine

   attacking a man?" He speaks as if it were nothing but imagination--it
   would never come to anything more. And, blessed be God, they who think
   of destroying God's people do but imagine what will never come to pass!
   Their dreams shall never become facts. Saul and his sons, and his
   servants were slain upon Mount Gilboa--and the Prince of Darkness and
   all his hosts must fall before the arrows of our conquering King. "As a
   bowing wall shall you be." You have, perhaps, sometimes seen a wall
   which has a mass of earth pressing upon it on the other side and,
   therefore, it bows out through the excessive weight and through its own
   weakness. So have you seen a fence which totters and is ready to fall.
   The wood has grown rotten, the nails have dropped out and the old posts
   have perished in the ground. These are true pictures of the enemies of
   God's people. They are bowing walls--a child may push them over! They
   are tottering fences--at the blast of God's breath in His wrath, they
   shall be blown to the ground at once!

   4. They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight
   in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. This has
   been the typical character of the enemies of God's people in all
   generations--oily words on their tongues, but sharp daggers in their
   hearts! If they would speak as they feel, then they would be easily
   recognized, but they do not and, therefore, are they like wolves in
   sheep's clothing. The Lord deliver me from all such enemies! Blessed be
   His name! If we truly wait upon Him, we shall be delivered from them
   all in due time!

   5, 6. My Soul, wait you only upon God, [See Sermon #144, Volume
   3--WAITING ONLY UPON GOD.] for my expectation is from Him. He only is
   my rock and my salvation: He is my defense, I shall not be moved. Some
   people only pray if they are in a good frame of mind, but we ought to
   pray to get ourselves into a good frame of mind! That is what David
   did. You notice that he improves as he goes on. In the second verse, he
   says, "I shall not be greatly moved," but now, in this sixth verse, he
   says, "I shall not be moved." His faith grows as he prays and as he
   praises! And we, also, ought not only to pray when we feel most in the
   spirit of prayer, or to sing when our hearts are merry, but sometimes,
   like David, we may strengthen our faith while we pray and we may sing
   our griefs away till the spirit of praise shall fill our souls!

   7, 8. In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength and
   my refuge, is in God. Trust in Him at all times. Say, with Job, "Though
   He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." "Trust in Him at all times," even
   when He seems to be angry and hides His face from you. "Trust in Him at
   all times" even in the stormy and dark day. It is among the many
   excellences of faith that it can see in the dark, that it can walk
   abroad in foul weather, that it can ride at anchor in a storm and that
   when lions are in the way, it makes nothing of them! Well, then,
   troubled Christian, trust in Him now, at the present time! Leave your
   cares, sorrows and afflictions in this House of Prayer and go away with
   a song in your heart, if not in your mouth. "Trust in Him at all
   times"--

   8. You people, pour out your heart before Him. The Prophet Jeremiah
   bade the people pour out their heart "like water before the face of the
   Lord"--not like oil, some of which clings to the glass, but like water
   which runs away to the last drop. So, Sinner, pour out your whole heart
   before the Lord, for this is the way to be saved! Bring your heart all
   full of sin and sorrow--turn it upside down, pour the whole of its
   contents out at the foot of the Throne of Grace--and then wait until
   God fills your heart with peace and joy!

   8. God is a refuge for us.Not for David only, but for all who, by a
   simple, sincere faith, can find shelter and safety under the shadow of
   His wings.

   9. Surely men of low degree are vanity. They promise what they cannot
   perform.

   9. And men of high degree are a lie. They often promise what they will
   notperform. The many-headed multitude are vanity--put the whole of them
   into the scales and how much do they weigh? Just nothing! And as for
   the aristocrats, those great men that would ride roughshod over the
   whole world if they could, they are worse than nothing, for while the
   "men of low degree are vanity," the "men of high degree are a lie," and
   that is worse than vanity!

   9. To be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than
   vanity.Put in Caesar and the senators and nobles of Rome--and then put
   in the populace of Rome--"they are altogether lighter than vanity."
   Therefore it is no use to trust to men. If any man builds his comfort
   upon popularity, he builds upon the sand. Or if any build their hopes
   upon some great noble or prince, they build upon a lie, for he will
   fail them when most they need help. Blessed is the man who trusts in
   his God, but cursed is he that trusts in man!

   10. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches
   increase, set not your heart upon them. They will be as deceptive to
   you as the multitude or as the prince.

   11. God has spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongs
   unto God. Hear that, Christian, and from this day forward place no
   reliance upon yourself, or upon any but your God!

   12. Also unto you, O Lord, belongs mercy: for You render to every man
   according to his work. God gives to each Christian Grace proportioned
   to his work, and then He gives a reward--not of merit, but of mercy, in
   proportion to the work done. God grant us the Grace to read, mark,
   learn and inwardly digest this most instructive Psalm until our souls,
   like David's, truly wait only upon God!

"Oh, How He Loves!"

   (No. 3228)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   7, 1872.

   "Then said the Jews, Behold how He loved him!" John 11:36.

   IT was at the grave of Lazarus that Jesus wept and His grief was so
   manifest to the onlookers that they said, "Behold how He loved him!"
   Most of us here, I trust, are not mere onlookers, but we have a share
   in the special love of Jesus. We see evidences of that love, not in His
   tears, but in the precious blood that He so freely shed for us--and so
   we ought to see further into His heart than they did--and to know more
   of Him than they could in the brief interval in which they had become
   acquainted with Him. When we think of His love to us, we may well cry,
   "Behold how He has loved us!"

   These Jews expressed their wonder at the love that Jesus had for His
   friend, Lazarus. They did not keep that wonder to themselves, but they
   said, "Behold how He loved him!" In these days, we are too apt to
   repress our emotions. I cannot say that I greatly admire the way in
   which some enthusiastic folk shout, "Glory!" "Hallelujah!" "Amen," and
   so on, in the midst of sermons and prayers. Yet I would sooner have a
   measure of that enthusiastic noise than have you constantly stifling
   your natural emotions and checking yourself from giving utterance to
   your heart's truer feelings. If we were in a right state of mind and
   heart, we would often say to one another, "How wondrous has the love of
   Jesus been to us!" Our conversation with one another as Brothers and
   Sisters in Chris, would often be upon this blessed subject. We waste
   far too much of our time upon trifles--it would be well if the love of
   Jesus so engrossed our thoughts that it engrossed our conversation,
   too! I fear that many who profess to be Christians go for a whole year,
   or even longer, without telling to others what they are supposed to
   have experienced of the love of Jesus. Yet this ought not to be the
   case. If we were as we should be, one would frequently say to another,
   "How great is Christ's love to me, my Brother! Do you also say that it
   is great to you?" Such talk as that between the saints on earth would
   help us to anticipate the time when we shall need no other theme for
   conversation in the land beyond the river!

   I am going to remind you of some very simple Truths of God in order to
   excite the hearts of those of you who are coming to the Communion
   Table. My objective is to increase your love to the dear Lord and
   Savior who has loved you so intensely as to die for you. And first,
   Beloved, let us think of what the love of Christ has done for us.
   Secondly, of what His love has done to us. And then, thirdly, I need to
   say that I am afraid our love to Christ will never cause any wonder
   except on account of the littleness of it

   I. So first, let us quietly think over WHAT THE LOVE OF CHRIST HAS DONE
   FOR US.

   When did Christ's love begin to work for us? It was long before we were
   born--long before the world was created! Far, far back in eternity, our
   Savior gave the first proof of His love to us by espousing our cause.
   By His Divine foresight, He looked upon human nature as a palace that
   had been plundered, broken down and in its ruins He perceived the owl,
   the bittern, the dragon and all manner of unclean things. Who was there
   to undertake the great work of restoring that ruined palace? No one but
   the Word, who was with God, and who was God. "He saw that there was no
   man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore His own arm
   brought salvation unto him, and His righteousness, it sustained him."
   Before the angels began to sing, or the sun, moon and stars threw their
   first beams across primeval darkness, Christ espoused the cause of His
   people and resolved not only to restore to them all the blessings that
   He foresaw that they would lose, but also to add to them richer favors
   than could ever have been theirs except through Him. Even from eternity
   His delights were with the sons of men! And when I think of Him in that
   far-distant past of which we can

   form so slight a conception, becoming "the Head over all things to the
   Church" which then existed only in the mind of God, my very soul cries
   out in a rapture of delight, "Behold how He loved us!"

   Remember, too, that in that eternal secret council, the Lord Jesus
   Christ became the Representative and Surety of His chosen people. There
   was to be in what was then the far remote future, a Covenant between
   God and man. But who was there who was both able and willing to sign
   that Covenant on man'sbehalf and to give a guarantee that men's part of
   that Covenant should be fulfilled? Then it was that the Son of God,
   well knowing all that such a Suretyship would involve, undertook to be
   the Surety for His people to fulfill the Covenant on their behalf, and
   to meet all its demands which He foresaw that they would be unable to
   meet! Then the Eternal Father gave into Christ's charge, the souls that
   He had chosen unto eternal life though ages, of which we can have so
   faint an idea, were to elapse before those souls were to be created!
   And the Eternal Son covenanted to redeem all those souls after they had
   fallen through sin--to keep them by His Grace and to present them
   "faultless" before the Presence of His Father with exceeding joy! Thus,
   as Jacob became accountable to Laban for the whole flock committed to
   his charge, Jesus Christ, "that Great Shepherd of the sheep, through
   the blood of the "Everlasting Covenant," undertook to redeem and guard
   the whole flock entrusted to His care, so that when, at the last great
   muster, they should pass under the hand of Him that counts them, not
   one of them would be missing and the blessed Shepherd-Son would be able
   to say to His Father, "Those that You gave Me I have kept, and not one
   of them is lost." It was in the Everlasting Covenant that our Lord
   Jesus Christ became our Representative and Surety, and engaged on our
   behalf to fulfill all His Father's will! And as we think of this great
   mystery of mercy, surely all of us who are truly His must exclaim with
   grateful adoration, "Behold how He loved us!"

   I have been speaking of very ancient tidings, but let us now come to
   matters that we can more clearly comprehend. In the fullness of time,
   our Lord Jesus Christ left the glories of Heaven and took upon Him our
   nature. We know so little of what the word, "Heaven," means that we
   cannot adequately appreciate the tremendous sacrifice that the Son of
   God must have made in order to become the Son of Mary. The holy angels
   could understand far better than we can what their Lord and ours gave
   up when He renounced the royalties of Heaven and all the honor and
   glory which rightly belonged to Him as the Son of the Highest--and left
   His Throne and Crown above to be born as the Babe of an earthly
   mother--yet even to the angels there were mysteries about His
   Incarnation which they could not fathom. And as they followed the
   footprints of the Son of Man on His wondrous way from the manger to the
   Cross and to the tomb, they must often have been in that most
   suggestive attitude of which Peter wrote, "which things the angels
   desire to look into." To us, the Incarnation of Christ is one of the
   greatest marvels in the history of the universe, and we say with Paul,
   "Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness. God was
   manifest in the flesh." The Omnipotent Creator took the nature of a
   creature into indissoluble union with His Divine Nature and, marvel of
   marvels, that creature was man! "He took not on Him the nature of
   angels, but He took on Him the seed of Abraham." For an angel to become
   an ant, if that were possible, would be nothing at all in comparison
   with the condescension of Christ in becoming the Babe of Bethlehem!
   For, after all, angels and ants are only creatures formed by Christ
   working as one of the Persons of the ever-blessed Trinity, for John,
   writing under the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit, expressly says, "All
   things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was
   made." O glorious Bridegroom of our hearts, there never was any other
   love like Yours! That the Eternal Son of God should leave His Father's
   side and stoop so low as to become one with His chosen people, so that
   Paul could truly write, "We are members of His body, of His flesh, and
   of His bones," is such a wonder of condescending Grace and mercy that
   we can only exclaim again and again, "Behold how He loved us!"

   Then, "being found in fashion as a Man," He took upon Himself human
   sickness and suffering. All our infirmities that were not sinful, Jesus
   Christ endured--the weary feet, the aching head, and the palpitating
   heart--"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
   Prophet, saying, "Himself took our infirmities, and bore our
   sicknesses." This was a wondrous proof of love--that the ever-blessed
   Son of God, who needed not to suffer, should have been willing to be
   compassed with infirmity just like any other man is. "We have not a
   High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;
   but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."

   But if you want to see the love of Jesus at the highest point it ever
   reached, you must, by faith, gaze upon Him when He took upon Himself
   the sins of all His people, as Peter writes, "who His own Self bore our
   sins in His own body on the tree. Oh, how could One who was so pure, so
   absolutely perfect, ever bear so foul a load? Yet He did bear it and
   the transfer of His people's sin from them to Him was so complete that
   the Inspired Prophet wrote, "The Lord has laid on

   Him the iniquity of us all," and the Inspired Apostle wrote, "He has
   made Him who knew no sin, to be sin for us that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in Him." When a man marries a woman who is deeply
   in debt, knowing well the burden that he is taking upon himself--even
   though it is enough to crush him all his life--we may well say, "Behold
   how he loves her!" That was what Christ did for His Church when He took
   her into an eternal marriage union with Himself although she had
   incurred such liabilities as could not have been discharged if she had
   spent all eternity in Hell! He took all her debts upon Himself and then
   paid then unto the utter most farthing. For we must never forget that
   when Christ bore His people's sins, He also bore the full punishment of
   them! In fulfillment of the great Eternal Covenant and in prospect of
   all the glory and blessings that would follow from Christ's atoning
   Sacrifice, "it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He has put Him to
   grief." We cannot have the slightest conception of what that bruising
   and that grief must have been! We do not know what our Lord's physical
   and mental agonies must have been, yet they were only the shell of His
   sufferings--His soul-agony was the kernel--and it was that which made
   Him cry, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" Then it was that
   the precious "corn of wheat" fell into the ground and died. And dying,
   brought forth "much fruit" of which Heaven and eternity, alone, can
   tell the full tale! I cannot speak of this wondrous mystery as I would
   like to do, but you who know even in part what it means must join me in
   saying, "Behold how He loved us!"

   Further than that, Christ has so completely given Himself to us that
   all that He has is ours. He is the glorious Husband and His Church is
   His bride, the Lamb's wife. And there is nothing that He has which is
   not also hers even now, and which He will not share with her forever!
   By a marriage bond which cannot be broken, for He hates putting away,
   He has espoused her unto Himself in righteousness and truth, and she
   shall be one with Him throughout eternity! He has gone up to His
   Father's house to take possession of the many mansions there, not for
   Himself, but for His people. And His constant prayer is, "Father, I
   will that they, also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am;
   that they may behold My Glory, which You have given Me: for You loved
   Me before the foundation of the world." Jesus has an ever-flowing
   fountain of joy in His heart, but He desires that His joy may be in you
   if you belong to Him--and that your joy may be full! And everything
   else that He has is yours as much as it is His, so surely you will
   again join with me in saying, "Behold how He loved us!"

   II. Now, secondly, let us consider WHAT CHRIST HAS DONE TO US, for each
   of His acts of love should cause us to exclaim, "Behold how He loved
   us!"

   Think, dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, how the Lord dealt with us
   in the days of our unregeneracy. He called us again and again, but we
   would not go to Him. And the more lovingly He called us, the more
   resolutely we hardened our hearts and refused to accept His gracious
   invitation. With some of us, this refusal lasted for years--and we now
   wonder why the lord waited for us so long. If a rich man invites a
   pauper to a feast and the poor man is indifferent to the invitation, or
   positively refuses to accept it, he gets no second invitation, for man
   does not press his charity upon the needy. But when we even scoffed at
   our Lord's call and made all manner of excuses for not coming to the
   Gospel banquet, He would not take our, "No," for an answer, but called,
   and called--again and again--until at last we could hold out no longer
   and had to yield to the sweet compulsion of His Grace! Do you not
   remember, Beloved, how you received pardon, justification, adoption and
   the indwelling of the Spirit--and how the many "exceeding great and
   precious promises" were brought to you like the various courses at a
   royal festival served upon golden dishes adorned with priceless gems?
   Oh, that blessed, blessed day in which you first came and sat among the
   guests at the great King's table! As you look back upon it, your heart
   glows in grateful remembrance of Christ's mercy to you--and you cannot
   help saying, "Behold how He loved us!"

   Many days have passed since then, and I ask you, now, to remember what
   Christ has done to us since we first trusted in Him. Has His love for
   you cooled in the slightest degree? We have, all of us, tried that love
   by our wandering and waywardness, but we have not quenched it--and its
   fire still burns just as vehemently as at the first! We have,
   sometimes, fallen so low that our hearts have been like adamant,
   incapable of emotion, yet Jesus has loved us all the while and softened
   our hard hearts as the glorious sun melts the icebergs of the sea! We
   were like the insensible grass which calls not for the dew, yet the dew
   of His love gently fell upon us. And though we had not sought it, our
   hearts were refreshed by it. Our Lord has, indeed, proved how He loved
   us by the gracious way in which He has borne with our many
   provocations. And think, too, Beloved, with what gifts He has enriched
   us, with what comforts He has sustained us, with what Divine energy He
   has renewed our failing strength and with what blessed guidance He has
   led and is still leading us! Take your pencil and paper and try to set
   down in figures or in words your total indebtedness to His love--where
   will you begin and when you have begun, where will you finish? If you
   were to record only one out of a million of His love-gifts to you,
   would the whole world be able to contain the books that might be
   written concerning them? No! All you can say is, "Behold how He has
   loved us!"

   There have been times--of which I will not say much just now, for some
   here would not understand what I mean-- when we have seemed to stand in
   the very suburbs of Heaven! Where we could hear the bells pealing forth
   celestial music from the invisible belfries and our hearts were
   ravished with the sound of the heavenly harpers harping with their
   harps and the ten thousand times ten thousand white-robed choristers
   singing the Song of Moses and of the Lamb. No, more than that--the King
   Himself has brought us into His banqueting house and His banner over us
   has been love! He has not only permitted us to sit at His feet, as Mary
   did, but He has allowed us to pillow our head on His bosom, as John
   did, and even condescended to let us put our finger into the print of
   the nails in our rapturous familiar fellowship with Him who is not
   ashamed to call us His brethren! I must not continue in this
   strain--not for lack of matter, but for lack of time in which to speak
   concerning Him, so I must again say, "Behold how He loved us!"

   I must, however, mention one more proof of Christ's love, and that is
   this--He has made us long for Heaven and given us at least a measure of
   preparation for it. We are expecting that one of these days, if the
   chariot and horses of fire do not stop at our door, our dear Lord and
   Savior will fulfill to us His promise, "if I go and prepare a place for
   you, I will come again and receive you unto Myself, that where I am,
   there you may be also." To a true Believer in Jesus, the thought of
   departing from this world and going to be "forever with the Lord," has
   nothing of gloom associated with it! This earth is the place of our
   banishment and exile--Heaven is our home! We are like the loving wife
   who is separated by thousands of miles of sea and land from her dear
   husband--and we are longing for the great reunion with our Beloved
   Lord, from whom we shall, then, never again be separated! I cannot hope
   to depict the scene when He shall introduce us to the principalities
   and powers in heavenly places and bid us sit with Him on His throne,
   even as He sits with His Father on HisThrone. Surely, then, the holy
   angels who have never sinned will unite in exclaiming, "Behold, how He
   loved them!" It is a most blessed thought to my mind, that we may be up
   there before the second hand of that clock completes another round! But
   if not as soon as that, it will not be long before all of us who love
   the Lord will be with Him where He is--and then the least among us
   shall know more of His love than the greatest of us can ever know while
   here below! Meanwhile, we have much of the joy of Heaven even while we
   are upon this earth, for, as Paul wrote to the Ephesians, "God, who is
   rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we
   were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by Grace you
   are saved), and has raised us up together, and made us sit together in
   heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

   III. The closing portion of my sermon is to be very practical. Did
   anybody ever say of anyone of us here, "Behold how He loves Christ"? If
   someone did say that of you, my Brother or Sister, was it true? I think
   I hear your answer, "Oh, I do love Him! He knows all things and He
   knows that I love Him." But do you love Him so fervently that strangers
   or even your more intimate acquaintances would say of your love to
   Jesus what the Jews said of His love to Lazarus, "Behold how He loved
   him! "I wish," says one, "I could do so." Then listen for a minute or
   two while I tell you of WHAT SOME SAINTS HAVE DONE TO SHOW HOW THEY
   LOVED THEIR LORD.

   There have been those who have suffered for Christ's sake. They have
   lain in damp dungeons and have refused to accept liberty at the price
   of treachery to their Lord and His Truths. They have been stretched
   upon the rack, yet no torture could make them yield up their fidelity
   to God! If you have read Foxe'sBook of Martyrs, you know how hundreds
   of brave men, women and children, too, stood at the stake, gloriously
   calm, and often triumphantly happy--and were burnt to death for
   Christ's sake, while many of those who looked on learned to imitate
   their noble example. And others who heard their dying testimonies and
   their expiring songs, (not groans), could not help exclaiming, "Behold
   how these martyrs love their Master!"

   There have been others who have shown their love to their Lord by
   untiring and self-sacrificing service. They have labored for Him--at
   times under great privations and amid many perils--some as missionaries
   in foreign lands and others with equal zeal in this country. Their
   hearts were all aglow with love for their dear Lord and Savior. And
   they spent their whole time and strength in seeking to win souls for
   Him, so that those who knew them could not help saying, "Behold how
   they love their Lord!" Some of us can never hope to wear the ruby crown
   of martyrdom, yet we may be hon-

   ored by receiving the richly-jeweled crown from the hand of Christ as
   He says to each of His true laborers, "Well done, good and faithful
   servant...enter into the joy of your Lord."

   Then we have known some saints who showed their love to their Lord by
   weeping over sinners and praying for their conversion. There have been
   gracious men and women who could not sleep at night because of their
   anxiety about the eternal welfare of their relatives and friends, or
   even of lost ones who were personally unknown to them--and they have
   risen from their beds to agonize in prayer for sinners who were either
   calmly sleeping and not even dreaming of their doom, or else at that
   very hour were adding to their many previous transgressions! There have
   been others who could not hear a blasphemous word, as they passed along
   the street, without feeling a holy indignation at the injury that was
   being done to their best Friend! And at the same time their eyes filled
   with tears of pity for the poor blasphemers and their hearts poured out
   a stream of supplication for those who were thus ignorantly or wantonly
   sinning against the Most High! They have been like Jeremiah weeping
   over the lost and like Moses and Paul ready to sacrifice their own
   souls for the sake of others, until men have been compelled to say,
   "Behold how these weeping and pleading saints love their Lord and love
   lost sinners for His sake!"

   Others have proven their love to their Lord by the way in which they
   have given of their substance to His cause. They have not only given a
   tithe of all they had to the great Melchizedek, but they have counted
   it a high privilege to lay all that they had upon His altar, counting
   that their gold was never so golden as when it was all Christ's and
   that their lands were never so valuable to them as when they were
   gladly surrendered to Him! Alas, that there should be so few, even in
   the Church of Christ, who thus imitate their Lord who freely gave
   Himself and all He had that He might save His people! Blessed will the
   Church be when she gets back to the Pentecostal consecration which was
   the fitting culmination of the Pentecostal blessing--"all who believed
   were together, and had all things common; and sold their possessions
   and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need."

   Another most admirable way of proving our love to Christ is by being
   scrupulously careful to please Him in little things as well as in the
   more important matters. One of the worst signs of this present evil age
   is that so little is thought of even the great things of Christ--His
   atoning Sacrifice, His high priestly Character and work, His kingly
   rule and so on--while the little things of Christ, those that are less
   by comparison with these, are often utterly despised! There was a time,
   in Scotland, when men of God signed the Solemn League and Covenant with
   their blood--how many would do that today? One jewel in Christ's crown,
   that priceless Koh-I-Noor of the crown rights of the King of kings, was
   sufficient to call into the battlefield the noblest of Scotland's sons.
   But today, the very Crown of Christ, itself, is kicked about like a
   football by some of His professed servants, for they set up their own
   fallible judgments against His Infallible Revelation and practically
   say, "We will not have this Man to reign over us!" In this land, in the
   most glorious days that England has ever seen, our Puritan forefathers
   were so scrupulous that men called them strait-laced, sour-faced,
   bigoted and I know not what! But nowadays many of the Truths of God for
   which they contended and for which many of them resisted even unto
   blood, are said to be unimportant or of no account whatever! The
   special Truth of God which distinguishes us as a denomination is
   regarded by many with supreme contempt! Not long ago a professedly
   Christian minister said that he did not care a penny about baptism! If
   he belongs to Christ, he will have to answer to his Master for that
   saying! But I could not utter such sentence as that without putting my
   very soul in peril! He who really loves His Lord will not trifle with
   the least jot or tittle of His Lord's will. Love is one of the most
   jealous things in the universe. "God is a jealous God," because "God is
   Love." The wife who truly loves her husband will not harbor even a
   wanton imagina-tion--her fidelity to him must not be stained even by an
   unchaste thought--and so must it be with every true lover of the Lord
   Jesus Christ! God grant that we, beloved Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ, may do our Lord's will so scrupulously in great things and
   little things--and in all things alike--that those who see us in our
   daily life may be compelled to say, "Behold how these Christians love
   Jesus Christ, their Lord and Savior!"

   But, Beloved, remember that when our love has reached its climax, it
   can only be like a solitary dewdrop trembling on a leaf compared with
   the copious showers of love that pour continually from the heart of our
   dear Lord and Master! Put all our loves together and they will not fill
   a tiny cup! And there before us flows the fathomless, limitless,
   shoreless ocean of the love of Jesus Christ! Yet let us have all the
   love for Him that we can. May the Holy Spirit fill our souls to the
   brim with love to Jesus for His dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MARK1:28-45; 2:1-12,

   Mark 1:28. And immediately His fame spread abroad throughout all the
   region round about Galilee. ' 'Immediately." That is, as soon as Jesus
   had healed the man with an unclean spirit His fame spread like
   wildfire. The miracle was reported from mouth to mouth till everybody
   in that region knew of it. It was said that the words and writings of
   Martin Luther were carried as by the wings of angels, so speedily was
   everything that he said and wrote made known far and wide. On this
   occasion, it was so with our Lord's wondrous deed of mercy and
   power--"Immediately His fame spread abroad throughout all the region
   round about Galilee."

   29. And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
   entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
   "Forthwith," or again, "immediately." Simon and Andrew and James and
   John were intimately connected--we are told that they were "partners"
   in their fishing business. James and John, the sons of Zebedee, seem to
   have been in a good position in life--we read that their father had
   "hired servants" employed in the boats. So James and John went with
   Simon and Andrew into their partners' house when Christ went there
   after performing that notable miracle in the synagogue.

   30. But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and soon they told
   Him of her. There were at least four of Christ's followers in the
   house, yet the mother of the wife of one of them lay sick of a fever.
   Divine Grace does not prevent suffering in the body--there will still
   be physical diseases even though in the soul there is spiritual health.

   31. And He came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up. And
   immediately the fever left her, andshe ministered

   unto them. [See Sermon #2980, Volume 52--A LIFT FOR THE PROSTRATE.]
   Jesus was very calm. He was not afraid of catching the fever. See how
   deliberately and with what solemn, kindly dignity He deals with this
   sick woman. "He came and took her by the hand." I think I see Him doing
   it, "and lifted her up." He gently raises her and she yields to His
   tender uplifting hand--and suddenly finds herself cooled of the burning
   fever and perfectly restored to health and strength! So she rises from
   her bed and the first thing she does is to minister to them. I am sure
   that whenever the Lord helps any of His people out of their temporal or
   spiritual distresses, they feel at once that they must say, "What shall
   we render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward us?" Her
   ministering unto them proved that the fever was quite gone--and gone in
   a way in which it does not ordinarily go, for as you all know, fever
   usually leaves behind it extreme weakness. It seems to burn up the
   strength that is in one--and after it is gone, one is not fit even to
   wait at table for a long while! But Peter's wife's mother, the fever
   having immediately left her, rose and "ministered unto them." Christ's
   cures are always complete! If He saves us from the burning fever, He
   saves us from the weakness that follows it! And when He deals with soul
   maladies, His cures are equally complete--there are no aftereffects to
   the soul as there are in many diseases that afflict the body. When the
   Great Physician restores the soul, He restores it completely.

   32. And at evening, when the sun did set, they brought unto Him all
   that were diseased and them that were possessed with devils.It was the
   Sabbath and they would not bring out their sick until the Day of Rest
   was over. The Jewish Sabbath ended at the setting of the sun, so these
   people were all watching and waiting until the sun dipped below the
   horizon and then, straightaway, they brought their suffering ones to
   Jesus! What a mass of misery filled the streets of Capernaum that
   memorable night! The whole city was turned into a hospital.

   33. And all the city was gathered together at the door. It seemed as if
   everybody had come either to be healed or to witness the healing of
   others--"All the city was gathered together at the door." Oh, when
   shall we see our places of worship thronged in this fashion with the
   spiritually sick? When will this great city of London begin to turn
   towards the Lord Jesus Christ? Will any of us live to see all our
   fellow citizens gathered together around the Savior to be healed by Him
   of all the wounds that sin has made?

   34. And He healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out
   many devils; and allowed not the devils to speak because they knew Him.
   They would persist in acknowledging Him--perhaps with the design of
   injuring His cause, for nothing hurts the cause of Christ more than to
   have it praised by bad men or evil spirits! I do not know that an
   outrageous sinner, if he will not repent, can do Christ a better turn
   than to abuse Him, for then he is speaking after his own natural
   manner--but when the devil or his servants go into the pulpit and begin
   to speak in praise of Christ, then is

   Christ's cause in an evil case, indeed--so He "allowed not the devils
   to speak, because they knew Him." Or, as the margin puts it, even "to
   say that they knew Him."

   35. And in the morning, rising up a great while before day. While it
   was yet dark, He stole away even from His favored disciples that He
   might be alone with His Father.

   35-37. He went out and departed into a solitary place, and there
   prayed. And Simon and they that were with Him

   followed after Him. And when they had found Him, [See Sermon #1769,
   Volume 30--BEFORE DAYBREAK WITH CHRIST.] For He had endeavored to
   conceal Himself in the loneliest spot that He could find. Possibly, the
   disciples overheard His groans, His cries, His supplications as He
   poured out His very soul in prayer to His Father--"when they had found
   Him"--

   37, 38. They said unto Him, All men seek for You. And He said to them,
   Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there, also, for
   therefore came I forth. Jesus Christ came forth from God the Father
   that He might proclaim throughout the land the message of redeeming
   Grace and dying love!

   39, 40. And He preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and
   cast out devils. And there came a leper to Him, beseeching Him, and
   kneeling down before Him, and saying unto Him, If You will, You can
   make me clean. [See Sermon #2008, Volume 34--THE LORD AND THE LEPER.]
   It is a pity that he

   could not go further than to say to Christ. "If You will," but it is a
   great mercy that he could go as far as that. So if you, dear Friend,
   cannot pray a prayer that is full of faith, pray one that has at least
   some faith in it! If you cannot go as far as some do, go as far as you
   can! I have often told you to bless God for moonlight, and then He will
   give you sunlight, but for anyone to say, "I will not pray at all
   because I cannot pray as I would like to pray," is a very foolish
   thing! Say what you can, even as this poor leper said to Jesus, "If You
   will, You can make me clean."

   41. And Jesus, moved with compassion. This is a wonderful expression,
   "moved with compassion." The face of Jesus and His whole Person showed
   that His very soul was stirred by an intense feeling for this poor
   leper! Jesus, moved with compassion--

   41. Put forth His hand and touched him, and said unto him, I will Be
   you clean. If you or I were to touch a leper, his uncleanliness would
   at once be communicated to us, but when Christ touches a leper, His
   cleanliness is communicated to the leper! Oh, how high our blessed Lord
   stands above us! When we have to deal with certain peculiarly sad
   cases, we ought to go to the work with much earnest prayer that we
   ourselves may not be contaminated by contact with gross sinners, but
   Christ has such virtue in Himself that He can even touch the fevered
   and the leprous and yet sustain no injury!

   42. Andas soon as He hadspoken, immediately the leprosy departed from
   him, andhe was cleansed. This was another very wonderful miracle. All
   that dryness of the skin, that peeling, that inward foulness that eats
   into the bones and pollutes the very current of the blood--all this was
   quite gone--the Lord Jesus Christ made this foul, unclean leper
   perfectly clean and whole in a single moment!

   43. 44. And He at once charged him, and forthwith sent him away; and
   said unto him, See you say nothing to any man: but go your way, show
   yourself to thepriest, and offer for your cleansing those thing which
   Moses commanded for a testimony unto them. That was all he was to
   do--to go and show himself to the priest so that it might be officially
   known and certified that he was clean. And he was not to tell anyone
   else of his cure. He was disobedient to Christ-- perhaps you will think
   that he was very naturally and excusably so--but we must never make
   excuses for doing what Christ tells us not to do! Our duty is not to
   judge whether such-and-such a course will be profitable or beneficial,
   but to consider whether such-and-such a course is in accordance with
   the Word of the Lord! This man ought to have held his tongue, for
   Christ had told him to do so. I have no doubt that he said within
   himself, "The more I talk about this miracle, the more good I shall do
   and the more famous Christ's name will become." But He had no business
   to think that-- his business was to obey Christ's command!

   45. But he went out and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad
   the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter the city.
   There were such crowds that He could not work His miracles of healing.
   The disobedient man was no doubt moved by gratitude, which seems a very
   proper motive, yet his disobedience caused Christ serious inconvenience
   and hindered His work. And I have no doubt that there are many things
   done in the Church of God today of which many say, "They are very
   proper and very nice"--yes, but are they Scriptural Did the Master
   command them? If not, they will cause Him and His Kingdom serious
   inconvenience and loss at some time or other. We cannot too fully
   realize that as Christ's disciples, we are to obey Him implicitly--and
   the best proof of our gratitude is to do exactly as Christ

   bids us. This man blazed abroad the news of his cure so that, "Jesus
   could no more openly enter into the city--

   45. But was outside in deserted places: and they came to Him from every
   quarter [See Sermon #129, Volume 22--gathering to the

   CENTER--Read/download the entire sermon, free of charge, at
   http://www.spurgeongems.org.]

   Mark 2:1, 2. And again He entered into Capernaum after some days; and
   it was heard that He was in the house. And straightway many were
   gathered together, inasmuch that there was no room to receive them, no,
   not so even near the door: and He preached the Word unto thei . He
   could not be hidden--the healed leper had made His name so famous that
   men crowded to see Him--and He took advantage of their curiosity and,
   "preached the Word unto them."

   3-5. And they came unto Him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was
   borne of four. And when they could not come near unto Him for the
   crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was and when they had broken it
   up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. When Jesus
   saw their faith, He said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, your sins are
   forgiven you. Those who brought this man to Jesus believed that He
   could and would heal Him--and Christ delighted to honor their faith
   and, perhaps, also the faith of the palsied man himself.

   6-9. But there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning
   in their hearts, Why does this Man thus speak blasphemies? Who can
   forgive sins but God only? And immediately when Jesus perceived in His
   spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, He said to them, Why
   reason you these things in your hearts? Which is easier to say to the
   sick of the palsy, Your sins are forgiven you? Or to say, Arise and
   take up your bed and walk?It was just as easy to say either the one or
   the other.

   10-12. But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to
   forgive sins, (He said to the sick of the palsy), I say unto you,
   Arise, and take up your bed, and go your way into your house. And
   immediately he arose, took up the bed and went forth before them all;
   insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never
   saw it on this fashion!

The Royal Savior

   (No. 3229)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 1, 1872.

   "Him has God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Savior,
   to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins." Acts 5:31.

   [Another Sermon by Mr. Spurgeon upon the same verse is #1301, Volume
   22--A PRINCE AND A SAVIOR.]

   THIS was part of the answer of Peter and the other Apostles to the
   question and declaration of the high priest-- "Did not we command you
   that you should not teach in this name? And, behold, you have filled
   Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intend to bring this Man's blood upon
   us." Then Peter and the other Apostles replied, "We ought to obey God
   rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew
   and hanged on a tree." And, in the verse following our text, they
   claimed to be witness-bearers for the risen and reigning Prince and
   Savior. And, more than that, they declared that they were co-witnesses
   with "the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to them that obey Him." These
   Apostles were the representatives of Messiah, the Prince, acting under
   His authority and, as far as they could, filling up the gap caused by
   His absence. They asserted that their preaching and teaching had been
   done by Divine Command which could not be set aside by any human
   authority--imperial or ecclesiastical--and that the true Prince of
   Israel, the Son of David, alone, had the power and the right to issue
   commissions to those who owned allegiance to Jehovah. They declared
   that Jesus, whom the chief priests had crucified, was still alive
   reigning in Glory, enthroned at the right hand of God and that they
   were only fulfilling His royal commands when they were "standing in the
   Temple and teaching the people."

   Moreover, when the Apostles stated that in addition to being a Prince,
   Jesus was also a Savior, and that He had been exalted with His Father's
   right hand in order that He might "give repentance to Israel, and
   forgiveness of sins," they gave the very best reason in the world for
   their preaching--for they were all engaged in preaching that sinners
   should repent--and in assuring those who didrepent that their sins were
   forgiven for Christ's sake! I cannot conceive of any better argument
   than this which the Apostles used when answering the high priest--"You
   command us not to teach in Christ's name, but the command of the Son of
   God, our Prince and Savior, is 'that repentance and remission of sins
   [See

   Sermons #329, Volume 6--CHRIST'S FIRST AND LAST SUBJECT; #1729, Volume
   29--BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM and #3224, Volume 56--"REPENTANCE AND
   REMISSION."] should be preached in His name among all nations,

   beginning at Jerusalem.' So, as we 'ought to obey God rather than men,'
   we have filled Jerusalem with His Doctrine. And we mean to go on
   preaching repentance and remission until, as far as we are able, we
   have filled the whole world with this Doctrine." That purpose of Christ
   was, at least in part, fulfilled by the Apostles in their day. God did
   give repentance and remission of sins to a chosen remnant of Israel.
   And when the rest of the Jews rejected the testimony of Christ's
   servants, they said, as Paul and Barnabas did to the Jews at Antioch,
   "It was necessary that the Word of God should first have been spoken to
   you, but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of
   everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles." We must never forget,
   Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, that we owe the first preaching
   of the Gospel to the Jews. They were, in all lands that were then
   known, the heralds of Christ, publishing the royal proclamation far and
   wide. Under the old dispensation, "unto them were committed the oracles
   of God" and the Gospel of the New Covenant was, in the first instance,
   entrusted to them--and it was through the Jews that it was made known
   unto us Gentiles! Let us remember this fact as we contemplate the
   glorious future, both of Jews and Gentiles. Israel as a nation will yet
   acknowledge her blessed Prince and Savior. During many centuries the
   chosen people who were of old so highly

   favored above all other nations on the face of the earth, have been
   scattered and peeled, oppressed and persecuted, until sometimes it
   seemed as if they must be utterly destroyed--yet they shall be restored
   to their own land which again shall be a land flowing with milk and
   honey. Then, when their hearts are turned to Messiah the Prince and
   they look upon Him whom they have pierced, and mourn over their sin in
   so long rejecting Him, the fullness of the Gentiles shall also come and
   Jew and Gentile, alike, shall rejoice in Christ their Savior!

   In taking such a text as this, I think it is always right to first give
   the actual meaning of the passage before using it in any other way.
   This I have already done by showing you what I suppose the Apostles
   meant in replying as they did to the high priest. Now let us try to
   gather other Truths of God from this passage.

   I. First, let us learn that ALL WHO RIGHTLY RECEIVE CHRIST RECEIVE HIM
   BOTH AS PRINCE AND SAVIOR. He is exalted this day for many purposes--as
   a reward for all the pangs He endured upon the Cross, as our Covenant
   Head and Representative--and that He may rule over all things for the
   good of His Church, as Joseph ruled over Egypt for the good of his
   brethren. Christ is exalted as a pledge of our exaltation, for, "we
   know that when He shall appear, we shall be like He, for we shall see
   Him as He is."

   But our text declares that God has exalted Jesus that He may be to His
   own chosen people a Prince and a Savior-- not that He may be a Prince
   only, or a Savior only, but that He may be both a Prince and a Savior!
   He is a Prince to receive royal honors. A Prince to be the Leader and
   Commander of His people. A Prince whose every word is to be instantly
   and implicitly obeyed. A Prince before whom we who love Him will gladly
   bow, even as in Joseph's dream, his brothers' sheaves made obeisance to
   his sheaf and as they, themselves, afterwards "bowed themselves to him
   to the earth" when he became a great lord in Egypt. The Lord Jesus
   Christ is a Prince among men, a Prince in His Church and a Prince in
   the highest heavens! Indeed, He is more than a Prince as we understand
   that word, for He is "King of kings and Lord of lords." But He is also
   a Savior to be trusted. A Savior to be accepted with our whole heart. A
   Savior who exactly meets our needs, for we feel that we need to be
   saved, we recognize our inability to save ourselves and we perceive in
   Him the ability, the Grace, the power and everything else that is
   required in order to save us! So He is a Savior to be trusted and
   accepted as well as a Prince to be obeyed and honored!

   Let us never imitate those who talk of Christ as a Prince, but will not
   accept Him as a Savior. There are some who speak respectfully of Christ
   as a great Leader among men, a most enlightened Teacher and a holy Man
   whose life was perfectly consistent with His teaching so that He can be
   safely followed as an Example. He is their Prince, but that is all. We
   cannot occupy such a position as that! If we were to say that Christ is
   our Prince but not our Savior, we would have robbed Him of that honor
   which is, perhaps, dearer to Him than any other! It was not simply to
   reign over the sons of men that He came from Heaven to earth--He had
   legions of nobler spirits than those that dwell in bodies of clay,
   everyone of whom would gladly fly at His command to obey His behests!
   Besides, if He had pleased to do so, He had the power to create
   unnumbered myriads of holy beings who would have counted it their
   highest honor to be subservient to His will! Mere dominion is not what
   Christ craved--from of old His delights were with the sons of men
   because He had covenanted with His Father that He would save them.
   Therefore was He called Jesus, because He came to save His people from
   their sins! In order to accomplish that great purpose, it was necessary
   for Him to take upon Himself our nature and to live a life of perfect
   obedience to His Father's will and, at last, to die a shameful death
   upon the Cross that He might offer the one Sacrifice for sins, forever,
   that alone could bring salvation to all who believe in Him! We never
   read that Jesus said to His disciples, "I am longing for the hour when
   I shall take the reins of government into My hand and wear upon My head
   the crown of Universal Sovereignty." But we do read that He said to
   them, "I have a baptism to be baptized with and how am I straitened
   till it is accomplished." We never read that He said to the Jews, "I am
   come to rein over you." On the contrary, when men would have taken Him
   by force and made Him a king, He hid Himself from them. He was a King,
   but not a man-made king, and His rule was to be a contrast to that of
   every other monarch! Christ's own description of His mission was, "The
   Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost." I think
   that our royal Savior puts the saving before the ruling--and if I call
   Him, Prince, and deny Him the title of Savior, He will not thank me for
   such maimed and mutilated honors! No, God exalted Him to be a Prince
   and a Savior--and we must receive Him in both offices, or not at all.

   For, mark you, we cannot really receive Christ as Prince unless we also
   receive Him as Savior If we say that we accept Him as our Prince, but
   reject Him as our Savior, is there not merely disloyalty, but treason
   of the deepest dye in that

   rejection? This gracious Prince tells me that I am lost and undone and
   bids me trust Him to save me. If I practically tell Him that I do not
   need Him to save me--and I do that by rejecting Him--I virtually say
   that He came from Heaven to earth on an unnecessary errand, at least as
   far as I am concerned. If I do not put my trust in His expiatory
   Sacrifice, I say, in effect that His death upon Calvary was a
   superfluity by which He foolishly threw away His valuable Life in
   needless Self-sacrifice! But that would be rank blasphemy! If I reject
   Christ as Savior, I do by that very act reject Him as Prince. It is
   sheer mockery for me to say, "I honor Jesus of Nazareth, the King of
   the Jews, [See Sermons #1353, Volume 23--ecce rex and #3123,

   Volume 54--"THE KING OF THE JEWS."] but I refuse to be washed from my

   sin and uncleanness in the fountain filled with His blood! I am willing
   to accept the Man Christ Jesus as my Exemplar and I will try, as far as
   I can, to follow His steps, but I will not accept pardon at His hands."
   If I talk like that, Christ is neither my Prince nor my Savior, and I
   am His enemy! And unless I repent and bow before Him in real homage,
   and accept Him both as Prince and Savior, He will at the last condemn
   me with the rest of His enemies who said, "We will not have this Man to
   reign over us." You may extol Him with your tongue, but the sacrifice
   of a broken and contrite heart would be far more prized by Him than all
   your empty praises! It is a higher praise to Christ to stoop to kiss
   His pierced feet and find in His wounds perfect healing for all the
   wounds that sin has made, than to pronounce the most fulsome compliment
   upon His spotless Character! He needs not the meaningless flatteries of
   men, but He thirsts for the trustfulness of souls that are willing to
   be saved by Him! This is the best refreshment He can ever have, as He
   told His disciples when He had won to Himself the soul of that poor
   fallen woman at Sychar, "My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me
   and to finish His work."

   There are some who seem willing to accept Christ as Savior who will not
   receive Him as Lord. They will not often state the case quite as
   plainly as that, but as actions speak more plainly than words, that is
   what their conduct practically says. How sad it is that some talk about
   their faith in Christ, yet their faith is not proved by their works!
   Some even speak as if they understood what we mean by the Covenant of
   Grace, yet alas, there is no good evidence of Grace in their lives, but
   very clear proof of sin (not Grace) abounding. I cannot conceive it
   possible for anyone to truly receive Christ as Savior and yet not to
   receive Him as Lord. One of the first instincts of a redeemed soul is
   to fall at the feet of the Savior and gratefully and adoringly to cry,
   "Blessed Master, bought with Your precious blood, I acknowledge that I
   am Yours-- Yours only, Yours wholly, Yours forever! Lord, what will You
   have me to do?" A man who is really saved by Grace does not need to be
   told that He is under solemn obligations to serve Christ--the new life
   within him tells him that. Instead of regarding it as a burden, he
   gladly surrenders himself--body, soul and spirit, to the Lord who has
   redeemed him, reckoning this to be his reasonable service. Speaking for
   myself, I can truthfully say that the moment I knew that Christ was my
   Savior, I was ready to say to Him--

   "I am Yours and Yours alone, This I gladly, fully own! And in all my
   works and ways, Only now would seek Your praise. Help me to confess
   Your name, Bear with joy Your Cross and shame, Only seek to follow
   Thee, Though reproach my portion be." It is not possible for us to
   accept Christ as our Savior unless He also becomes our King, for a very
   large part of salvation consists in our being saved from sin's dominion
   over us--and the only way in which we can be delivered from the mastery
   of Satan is by becoming subject to the mastery of Christ! The "strong
   man armed" cannot keep us under his cruel sway when the stronger One
   overcomes him and sets us at liberty! In order that we may be rescued
   from this power of the Prince of Darkness, the Prince of Light and Life
   and Peace must come into our soul--and He must expel the intruder and
   take His rightful place as our Lord and Master, guarding by His own
   power what He has saved by His own right hand and His holy arm! If it
   were possible for sin to be forgiven and yet for the sinner to live
   just as he lived before, he would not really be saved. He might be
   saved from some part of the punishment due to sin, but he would still
   be a most wretched man, for if there were other punishment for sin than
   the slavery and tyranny of sin's own self, that would be punishment
   enough to make a man's life utterly miserable, like the poor wretch
   chained to a corpse and compelled to

   drag it about with him wherever he went. Let a man once know what sin
   really is and he needs nothing else to make him thoroughly unhappy. I
   was talking, only today, with a Christian Brother about our crosses and
   I said that I thanked God we were not left without a cross to carry.
   "Ah," my Friend replied, "but, there is one cross we would gladly throw
   away if we could, and that is the heaviest cross of all--the body of
   sin and death that is such a burden to us." Yes, that is, indeed, a
   grievous burden to true Christians! That is the iron that enters into
   our very soul. That is the gall of bitterness, the deadly venom of the
   old dragon's teeth and, therefore, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, we
   do not really receive Christ as our Savior unless we also receive Him
   as Prince. But when He comes to reign and rule in our mortal bodies,
   the tyranny of the usurper is broken and we know Jesus as the complete
   Savior of our body, soul and spirit. He would not be our Prince if He
   were not our Savior--and He would not be our Savior if He were not our
   Prince--but what a blessed combination these two offices make!

   The man who is taught of God to understand this great Truth of God will
   be a wise teacher of others. I believe that many errors in Doctrine
   arise through lack of a clear apprehension of Christ's various
   relationships towards His spiritual Israel. To some, Christ is only a
   Prince, so they have a sort of lifeless legality. Others live in
   Antinomian licentiousness because Christ is not the Prince and Lord of
   their lives. Beloved, he who receives Christ both as Prince and Savior
   has the blessed and happy experience of resigning his own will and
   subjecting all the passions of his soul to the sacred control of his
   glorious Prince and, at the same time he daily realizes in his soul the
   cleansing power of the precious blood of Jesus and so, as Mary sang,
   his spirit rejoices in God his Savior! This, also, is the true
   Christian practice as well as the Christian Doctrine and experience--to
   be always "looking unto Jesus" as my Savior, feeling that I always need
   Him in that capacity and that I shall need Him to save me even to my
   last moment on earth--yet also looking up to Him as my Prince, seeking
   to be obedient to Him in all things as far as I can learn His will from
   His Word and by the teaching of His Holy Spirit. And to conform my
   whole life to the royal and Divine commands that He has issued for my
   guidance. I have not the time to enlarge upon this Truth, but it seems
   to me that there is a practical lesson to be learned from the fact that
   all who rightly receive Christ receive Him both as Prince and Savior.

   There are preachers who preach mere morality. I trust their number is
   smaller than it used to be, but there are still too many professedly
   Christian ministers who are like that notable man who said that he
   preached morality till there was no morality left in the place. Yet
   afterwards, when he imitated Paul and preached Christ crucified, he
   soon found that vice hid her dishonored head and that all the Graces
   and virtues flourished under the shadow of the Cross! So have we found
   it and, therefore, whoever may preach anything else, we shall still
   stick to the old-fashioned theme that Paul preached--that old, old
   story which the seeker after novelties condemns as stale, but which, to
   the man who needs eternal life and longs for something that will
   satisfy his conscience and satiate his heart--has a freshness and charm
   which the lapse of years only intensifies, but does not remove!

   II. The second lesson we learn from our text is that REPENTANCE AND
   REMISSION OF SINS ARE BOTH NEEDED BY THOSE WHO DESIRE TO BE SAVED.
   Those needs are clearly indicated by Christ's offices as Prince and
   Savior. Inasmuch as He is a Prince, we must repent of our rebellion
   against Him. And inasmuch as He is a Savior, He is exalted with His
   Father's right hand to give us remission of sins as well as
   repentance--and we must have both these blessings if we are to be
   saved!

   First, we cannot be saved without repentance. No remission of sin can
   be given without repentance. The two things are so joined together by
   God, as they are in our text, that they cannot be separated. Many
   mistakes are made as to what true evangelical repentance really is.
   Just now some professedly Christian teachers are misleading many by
   saying that "repentance is only a change of mind." It is true that the
   original word does convey the idea of a change of mind, but the whole
   teaching of Scripture concerning the repentance which is not to be
   repented of is that it is a much more radical and complete change than
   is implied by our common phrase about changing one's mind. The
   repentance that does not include sincere sorrow for sin is not the
   saving Grace that is worked by the Holy Spirit! God-given repentance
   makes men grieve in their inmost souls over the sin they have
   committed--and works in them a gracious hatred of evil in every shape
   and form! We cannot find a better definition of repentance than the one
   many of us learned at our mother's knee--

   "Repentance is to leave The sin we loved before And show that we in
   earnest grieve By doing so no more."

   I am always afraid of a dry-eyed repentance and, mark you, if
   forgiveness should be granted to those who were not sorry for their
   sin, such forgiveness would tend to aid and abet sin--and would be no
   better than the Romish heresy that when you have sinned, all you have
   to do is to confess it to a priest, pay a certain sum of money
   according to the regular Roman tariff and start over again on your
   career of evil. God forbid that we should ever fall into that snare of
   the devil! If I could keep on living in sin and loving it as much as I
   ever did, and yet have remission of it, the accusation of the
   blasphemer that Christ is the minister of sin would be a just one! But
   it is not so! On the contrary, we must loathe sin, leave sin and have
   an agonizing desire to be clean delivered from it--otherwise we can
   never expect the righteous God to say to us, "Your sins, which are
   many, are all forgiven."

   Besides, if remission of sins could be obtained without repentance, the
   sinner would be left very much as he was before. Indeed, he would be in
   a worse condition than he was in before. If God couldsay to him, "I
   forgive you," and yet he remained unrepentant, unregenerated,
   unconverted--he would still be an enemy of God, for "the carnal mind is
   enmity against God: for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither,
   indeed, can be." Forgiveness would only make such a man a more
   impudent, hardened, self-righteous enemy of God than he was before! If
   there is not such a thorough Spirit-worked change in him that he flings
   away his weapons of rebellion and casts himself penitently at the feet
   of his offended Sovereign, I fail to see in what sense we can call him
   a saved man. No--repentance is the absolutely necessary prelude to
   remission!

   On the other hand, we cannot be saved without the remission of our sins
   following upon our redemption. God exalted Jesus "with His right hand
   to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and
   forgiveness of sins." Note that, "repentance," and, "forgiveness of
   sins," are separate and distinct Gifts of the exalted Christ. Our
   repentance does not entitle us to claim from God the pardon of our sin
   apart from His gracious promise to give it to us! If I get into a man's
   debt and then feel sorry that I owe him so much money, that regret will
   not pay my debt. If I transgress the law of the land and when I stand
   in the dock, say how grieved I am that I have broken the law, my sorrow
   will not pay the penalty that I have incurred! The magistrate or judge,
   in passing sentence upon me, may remit a portion of it because of my
   contrition, but I have no right to claim even that clemency on his
   part! And before God my sorrow for my sins gives me no claim upon Him
   for the remission of them. No, I must say to Him, as Toplady so truly
   sings--

   "Let the water and the blood, From Your riven side which flowed, Be of
   sin the double cure-- Cleanse me from its guilt and power! Could my
   zeal no respite know, Could my tears forever flow, All for sin could
   not atone-- You must save, and You alone." Suppose I do now hate some
   sin that I once loved or that I hate all sin? No credit is due to me,
   for that abhorrence of sin is what I ought always to have had! God had
   the right to claim from me the hatred of sin of every sort, but that
   hatred does not discharge the debt which I owe to God. I will go
   further than that and say that no one ever repents of sin so thoroughly
   as he does when he knows that it is forgiven. Hence when Christians
   begin their new life, they do not repent once and then leave off
   repenting--but repentance and faith go hand in hand with them all the
   way to Heaven! Indeed, dear old Rowland Hill used almost to regret that
   in Heaven he might not still have the tear of penitence glistening in
   his eyes, but of course, that is not possible, for of the redeemed in
   Glory it is expressly declared that, "God shall wipe away all tears
   from their eyes."

   III. Thirdly, and very briefly, BOTH REPENTANCE AND REMISSION ARE GIFTS
   FROM CHRIST. God has

   exalted Him "to give repentance.. .and forgiveness of sins."

   The same Lord who gives the remission also gives the repentance. This
   is worked in the Holy Spirit, yet it is not HE who repents, He cannot
   do so--and, besides, He has nothing of which He needs to repent! But we
   repent, and though it must always be our own act, yet it is Jesus' gift
   to us and the Spirit's work in us. Jesus bestows this gift upon us in
   His capacity as Savior--and we never truly repent until we recognize
   Jesus as our Savior and put our whole trust in His atoning Sacrifice.
   Smitten by the Cross, our rocky heart is broken and the streams of
   penitential tears gush forth even as

   the water leaped from the Rock smitten by the rod of Moses in the
   wilderness! When Jesus grants the Divine Grace of forgiveness, at the
   same moment He gives the tender heart that mourns that it should have
   needed forgiveness. I believe that if this Truth of God were thoroughly
   understood, it would help many more to receive the Calvinistic system
   of theology which now puzzles them. I know that when I first realized
   that my repentance was the gift of God, the whole Doctrine of Salvation
   by Grace fell into my soul as by a lightning flash!

   The other side of the Truth is that the same Lord who gives the
   repentance also gives the remission. No one will dispute the fact that
   the forgiveness of sins is the free gift of the exalted Savior. This
   priceless blessing could never be purchased by us, or deserved by us on
   account of our feelings, promises, works, or anything else. It is a
   gift--freely, wholly, absolutely a gift of God's Grace! It is given
   with repentance, but not given for or becauseof repentance! And
   wherever remission of sin is given, it works in the soul more and more
   repentance of sin, but it is, in itself, a gift independent of
   repentance, yet given with it--a royal gift from the royal Savior
   exalted with His Father's right hand. So what you have to do, dear
   Friends, is to look to Christ, and to Christ alone to give you
   penitence while you are impenitent, and to give you pardon when you are
   penitent. So, as Hart sings--

   "Come, you needy, come and welcome,

   God's free bounty glorify!

   True belief and true repentance,

   Every Grace that brings us nigh,

   Without money,

   Come to Jesus Christ and buy!

   Let not conscience make you linger,

   Nor of fitness fondly dream--

   All the fitness He requires

   Is to feel your need of Him--

   This He gives you!

   'Tis the Spirit's rising beam."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS 10.

   Verse 1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is
   that they might be saved. They had hunted Paul from city to city, but
   the only feeling for them that he had was a wish that they might be
   saved! Such a wish as that should be in the heart of every Christian.
   His desire for his bitterest enemy should be that he may be saved.

   2. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
   according to knowledge. We should always give people credit for every
   good thing that there is in them--it will often enable us all the
   better to point out other matters in which they are deficient. So Paul
   put it on record, concerning the Jews of his time, that they had a zeal
   for God, though it was not a zeal "according to knowledge."

   3. For they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to
   establish their own righteousness, have not

   submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. [See Sermons #1899,
   Volume 32--ZEALOUS, BUT WRONG and #2214, Volume 37-- BARRIERS BROKEN
   DOWN.] They were so busy trying to work out a

   righteousness of their own that they had never accepted the
   righteousness which God is prepared to freely give to all those who
   will receive it at His hands!

   4. For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to everyone that
   believes. [See Sermon #1325, Volume 22--christ the end

   OF THE LAW.] This is the very essence of the Gospel, that believing

   in Christ brings to sinners a righteousness which they can never obtain
   in any other way!

   5. 6. For Moses describes the righteousness which is ofthe Law, That
   the man which does those things shalllive by them. But the
   righteousness which is of faith--Is of quite another sort, for it--

   6-9. Speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into
   Heaven? (That is, to bring Christ down from above). Or, Who shall
   descend into the deep? (That is, to bring up Christ again from the
   dead). But what does it say? The word is near you, even in your mouth,
   and in your heart that is, the word of faith which we preach; that if
   you shall con-

   fess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart
   that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be

   saved. [See Sermon #1898, Volume 32--MOUTH AND HEART.] Oh, what a

   blessedly simple plan of salvation is here revealed! "If you shall
   confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart
   that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved." The Apostle
   says this plan of salvation is so near to men that it is in their
   mouth! When anything is in your mouth, how can you make it your own?
   Why, by swallowing it! And so near is the Gospel to every man that he
   has, as it were, but to drink it down to make it his very own! It is
   not up there on the lofty heights, nor down there in the deeps of the
   abyss, but it is here and wherever else Christ is preached and wherever
   His Word is read! O, Sinner, the Word of God is near you, even in your
   mouth and in your heart"--then put it not away from you, but hold it
   fast forever!

   10. For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the
   mouth confession is made unto salvation.

   [See Sermons #519, Volume 9--BELIEVING WITH THE HEART; #520, Volume
   9--CONFESSION WITH THE MOUTH and #3011, Volume 52--FAITH FIRST,
   CONFESSION FOLLOWING.] After believing in Christ, the man must

   confess that he does believe in Him. It would be a shame for any
   Believer to try to sneak into Heaven without acknowledging that Christ
   has saved him. If any man is ashamed of his religion, you may depend
   upon it that it is one of which he has cause to be ashamed! But he who
   has true saving faith in his heart should never blush to acknowledge
   it. What is there to blush about in being a Christian? Let those blush
   who are not believers in the Lord Jesus Christ!

   11, 12. For the Scripture says, Whoever believes on Him shall not be
   ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
   the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him. Whoever
   they may be, Jews or Gentiles, rich or poor, learned or illiterate,
   black or white--if they will but call upon God in prayer, He will not
   be miserly towards them, but He will be generous towards them in the
   abundance of the blessings which He will give them in answer to their
   cry!

   13, 14. For whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
   saved. How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not
   believed?They cannot rightly pray without faith, "for he that comes to
   God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek Him."

   14. And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?Those
   who do not hear the Gospel are not likely to believe it. And there are
   many unbelievers who never seek to hear it--and it is always wrong for
   a man to refuse to believe any Truth of God before he knows what it
   really is. There should at least be a sincere searching of the Holy
   Scriptures and a candid listening to the preaching of the Word before
   it is rejected.

   14, 15. And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they
   preach, except they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the
   feet of them that preach the Gospel of Peace, and bring glad tiding of
   good things." [See Sermon

   #2327, Volume 39--THE WHOLE MACHINERY OF SALVATION.] The Gospel

   brings gladness wherever it comes. The Word which we preach tells of
   joys that will last forever! The Gospel shall make the whole world sing
   with new music when it is received by all! And it shall roll away the
   mists that now swathe this poor dusky planet and make it shine out like
   its sister stars in all the Glory of God when once Christ is fully
   acknowledged here as Lord and Savior!

   16. But they have not all obeyed the Gospel.[See Sermon #2804, Volume
   48--DISOBEDIENCE TO THE GOSPEL.] All who have heard the Gospel have not
   obeyed it.

   16. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report? And what Isaiah
   said is what we also have to say today, "Who has believed our report?
   And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?"

   17. So, then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
   [See Sermon #1031, Volume 18--how can I obtain

   FAITH?] Salvation comes by faith, and faith comes by hearing,

   but that hearing must be the hearing of the Word of God! Surely there
   is no great difficulty in understanding the Gospel. This is no maze in
   which a man may lose himself. Here are no puzzling directions which
   only the learned can comprehend! No, but here stands the plain, simple,
   soul-quickening words, "Believe and live."

   18. 20 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
   into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. But, I
   say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will provoke you to
   jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will
   anger you. But Isaiah is very bold and says, I was found of them that
   sought Me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me.
   Is not that a wonderful text? There are some who have heard the Gos-

   pel year after year, and who have refused it-- and perished. And there
   are, on the other hand, scattered up and down this world, thousands of
   people who have never yet heard it, but the very first time they do
   hear it, they will accept it and be eternally saved!

   21. But to Israel--To God's ancient people to whom the Gospel had been
   preached when Paul wrote this Epistle-- "to Israel"--

   21. He says, All day long I have stretched forth My hands unto a
   disobedient and gainsaying people. It is strange that many who first
   hear the Word and often hear it, turn away from it. While others, to
   whom it comes as a complete novelty, are blessed the first time they
   hear it! I sometimes say that there are some hearers who regularly
   occupy these seats who are just like pieces of India rubber. They are
   easily impressed, they yield ascent to every Truth of God that is
   uttered, but they soon get back into their old shape again--and they
   are exactly the same after 20 years of hearing the Gospel as they were
   before--only that they are still more hardened. On the other hand,
   there will sometimes drop into this House of Prayer a thoroughly
   irreligious man with a heart as hard as a flint--and the very first tap
   of the hammer of the Gospel breaks the flint so effectually that it is
   never a flint again and God's Grace renews his heart then and there! It
   is our earnest desire, on all occasions whatever hearers are gathered
   here, that God's saving power may be manifested to all present. So may
   it be now, for Christ's sake, and to God's glory! Amen.

The Last Message for the Year

   (No. 3230)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1910.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   DECEMBER 28, 1873.

   "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me; and him that comes to
   Me I will in no wise cast out.

   John 6:37.

   [Mr. Spurgeon preached many Sermons upon this verse. Among those
   already published are #1762, Volume 30--HIGH DOCTRINE AND BROAD
   DOCTRINE; #2349, Volume 40--ALL COMERS TO CHRIST WELCOMED; #2954,
   Volume 51--THE BIG GATES WIDE OPEN and #3000, Volume 52--NUMBER
   3000--OR, COME AND WELCOME.]

   WE have come to the last Sabbath evening and the last public Sabbath
   service of another year. With some of us it may be our last Sabbath on
   earth and our last public Sabbath service in this life. It becomes us,
   then, to fix our thoughts upon solemn and weighty themes--those which
   are of the utmost importance to us--and those which most closely
   concern our eternal destiny. I pray that the Holy Spirit may cause the
   deepest possible seriousness to rest upon this whole assembly and that
   He may very specially guide me to speak as I ought upon the familiar
   but most weighty words that I trust He has moved me to select once
   again for your very earnest consideration tonight.

   I have preached many times upon this text but, on this occasion, I am
   going to speak briefly upon three topics that it suggests to me. The
   first is that there is only one way of salvation--"All that the Father
   gives Me shall come to Me." "Him that comes to Me." This topic will
   teach us the exclusiveness of Divine Grace. Secondly, this way will be
   used by some--"All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me." This
   teaches us the Omnipotence of Divine Grace. Thirdly, all who come by
   this way shall be saved--"him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast
   out." This teaches us the fullness and freeness of Divine Grace.

   I. First, then, we learn from our text THE EXCLUSIVENESS OF DIVINE
   GRACE--THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY OF SALVATION "All that the Father gives Me
   shall come to Me" "Him that comes to Me"

   To come to Jesus is the one and only way of salvation. If there could
   have been any other way, this one would never have been opened. It is
   not conceivable that God would have given His only-begotten and
   well-beloved Son to die upon the Cross of Calvary in order to save
   sinners if there had been any other way of saving them that would have
   been as consistent with the principles of Infallible Justice. If men
   could have entered into everlasting life without passing along the path
   stained and consecrated by the blood of Jesus, surely that blood would
   never have been "shed for many for the remission of sins." The very
   fact that this new and living way has been opened proves that there is
   no other, for God would never have provided it unless it had been
   absolutely necessary. That this is the only way of salvation is again
   and again emphasized in Scripture with a sacred intolerance which none
   ought to mistake! Writing to the Corinthians, under the Inspiration of
   the Holy Spirit, Paul says, "Other foundation can no man lay than that
   is laid, which is Jesus Christ." And to Timothy, his own son in the
   faith, he writes, "There is one God and one Mediator between God and
   men, the Man Christ Jesus." And the Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, who had
   a more loving heart than ever beat in any merely human being's breast,
   most solemnly said, in almost His last words on earth, "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall
   be damned."

   So there is no other way of salvation and sinners are most faithfully
   warned that however pleasant and attractive any other ways may appear
   to be, the end of those ways is death and "everlasting destruction from
   the Presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power." When Jesus
   said, "I am the Way," He clearly intended to exclude all other ways, so
   beware lest you perish in any one of them! Be not like the foolish and
   wicked people of Jeremiah's day to whom the Lord

   said, "Stand you in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where
   is the good way and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your
   souls." But, alas, they said, "We will not walk therein." Be you not
   like unto them!

   But what is this exclusive way of salvation? In our text it is twice
   described as coming to Christ. But what is meant by that expression? It
   does not mean any mere locomotion, any moving of the body from one
   place to another. There were many who came to Christ in that sense
   while He was upon the earth--they thronged around Him and pressed upon
   Him--but the mere proximity of their bodies to Christ did not bring
   salvation to them, for many of them turned away and walked no more with
   Him when His heart-searching teaching was too faithful for them. Well,
   then, what does coming to Christ readily mean?

   Coming to Christ means, first, turning away from all confidence in
   ourselves or in others and trusting alone in Jesus. In order to come to
   a certain person, you must turn away from another person who is in a
   different direction, so if you want to be saved, you must come right
   away from trusting in yourselves--you must cease to have any confidence
   in anything that you have ever done, or ever hope to do--you must not
   place any reliance upon the alms you have bestowed upon the poor, the
   prayers you have presented to God, the services you have attended, or
   anything of your own! You must utterly abhor all hope of salvation from
   yourself, even as Paul did when, after recounting the things in which
   he had formerly trusted, he wrote, "But what things were gain to me,
   those I counted loss for Christ. Yes, doubtless, and I count all things
   but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord,
   for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but
   dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own
   righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith
   of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith."

   If you are resolved to come to Christ, you must also give up all trust
   in others as a means of salvation. If you have up to now been placing
   any reliance upon your godly ancestry, your Christian father and
   mother, or if you have been depending upon your close connection with
   good people. If you have trusted to a man who calls himself a priest.
   If you have put any dependence upon what he can do towards your
   salvation--I pray you to cast away all such confidence, and dependence,
   for if you do not, you cannot come to Christ! If you have been relying
   upon any rite, or ceremony, or "sacrament" relating to water or bread
   and wine, any "priestly" performance, or posture, or ritual, or
   anything apart from the Lord Jesus Christ, I implore you to abandon all
   those soul-destroying delusions, for no one of them nor all of them
   combined will help you into the one and only way of salvation!

   For, observe, that the text speaks--and it is the Lord Jesus Christ who
   speaks through the text--of coming to a Person--"All that the Father
   gives ME shall come to ME; and him that comes to ME I will no wise cast
   out." Note how personal the text is both concerning the one coming and
   the One to whom he is to come--"Hm that comes to ME." That is the long
   and the short of the whole matter--its Alpha and Omega, its beginning
   and its end--there must be a personal coming to the personal Christ! It
   will not suffice for you to come to Christ's Doctrine--you must, of
   course, believe what He taught--but believing His teaching will not
   save you unless you come to HIM. It will not be enough merely to come
   to Christ's precepts and to try to practice them--an utterly impossible
   task for you to perform in your own unaided strength! You must first
   come to Christ and then, trusting in Him for salvation, His gracious
   Spirit will take of the things of Christ and show them to you, and
   teach and enable you to walk in His ways and to obey His precepts.

   Does someone ask, "Who and what is He to whom I am to come?" Listen.
   The Eternal Son of the Eternal Father-- He who has made the heavens and
   the earth and all things that are, whose almighty Word fashioned this
   round globe and sent it spinning on its wondrous course around the
   sun--the Creator and Lord of all the angelic host before whom cherubim
   and seraphim bow down in reverent adoration--this great King of kings
   and Lord of lords, in His amazing love and wondrous condescension,
   "made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a Servant,
   and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a
   Man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death
   of the Cross." It is to Him that you are to come! You are to believe in
   Him as the Incarnate God, equally and just as truly Son of Man and Son
   of God! And then, (and this is the crux of your faith, your faith in
   the Cross--that "Cross" in which Paul gloried--not a cross of wood, or
   stone, or ivory before which people idolatrously prostrate
   themselves--but the Doctrine of the Cross, which is today as great an
   "offence" as it was in Paul's day), you must believe that God laid upon
   His Incarnate and Immaculate Son, the sins of all His people whom He
   had given to Him from all eternity! And you must believe that He even
   took pleasure in bruising Him because of the wondrous results that were
   to follow and

   flow from His atoning Sacrifice on the Cross! Do you think I am
   speaking too strongly? Remember the words of the inspired Prophet
   Isaiah--"All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned, every
   one, to his own way, and the Lord has laid on Him (made to meet on Him)
   the iniquity of us all...It pleased the Lord to bruise Him. He has put
   Him to grief: when You shall make His soul an offering for sin, He
   shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure of the
   Lord shall prosper in His hand." If you, my Brother or Sister, rely
   upon this great expiatory Sacrifice and believe that when Christ died
   upon the Cross, He died as your Substitute and Representative, you are
   saved! You have entered the one and only way of salvation!

   But be assured of this, if you reject the Incarnate God. If you will
   not trust in Him. If you will not come to Him that you may have life,
   there is no other way of salvation and there will never be any other!
   Never forget that this same Jesus, who was taken up into Heaven, shall
   so come again in like manner as He went up into Heaven--and "when He
   shall come to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all them
   that believe," there will be others to whom His Second Advent will
   bring nothing but dismay and terror, for then, "the Lord Jesus shall be
   revealed from Heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking
   vengeance on them that know not God, and they that know not the Gospel
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting
   destruction from the Presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His
   power." It will be utterly in vain for you to cry, then, to the
   mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him
   that sits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great
   day of His wrath is come and who shall be able to stand?"

   II. Now, secondly, we learn from our text THE OMNIPOTENCE OF DIVINE
   GRACE--SOME WILL USE THIS ONE AND ONLY WAY OF SALVATION. "All that the
   Father gives Me shall come to Me"

   So first, there are some who were given to Christ. We believe that it
   is clearly revealed in the Scriptures that long before this earth was
   created, the Lord looked forward upon the race of human beings that He
   intended to live upon it, and that out of them He chose unto Himself a
   people whom He gave to His Son to be the reward of the suffering He
   would endure on their behalf. Peter wrote to the elect strangers, "You
   are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar
   people that you should show forth the praises of Him who has called you
   out of darkness into His marvelous light." And Paul wrote to Timothy,
   "The foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows
   them that are His." We do not know them, but He knows everyone of them
   and He counts them as His own peculiar treasure! "They shall be Mine,
   says the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels." These
   people have been given to Christ by His Father. Again and again, in
   that great intercessory prayer of His, He spoke of this Truth of God!
   In fact, the prayer begins with an emphatic declaration of it--"Father,
   the hour is come; glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You;
   as You have given Him power over all flesh, that He should give eternal
   life to as many as You have given Him."

   In our text Christ says that these people shall come to Him. "All that
   the Father gives Me shall come to Me." There is no question about
   whether they will come, or will not come--Christ says that they "shall
   come" to Him. "But," asks someone, "will God force them to come to
   Christ against their will?" Oh, no--He has a gracious way of making
   them willing in the day of His power. By His Spirit's Divine teaching,
   He will instruct them, illuminate them, persuade them, compel them so
   that everyone of those who were given to Christ will come to Him. "But
   they are blind," says another. The Lord says, "I will bring the blind
   by a way that they know not." "But they are very obstinate." The Lord
   says, "I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness and speak
   comfortably unto her." "But they are dead." Yes, that is true, but the
   Lord quickens those who are dead in trespasses and sins. Without
   violating our wills and leaving us to still act as free agents
   responsible for our own actions, He makes us willing to yield ourselves
   up to Christ--body, soul and spirit--to be forever His!

   Why does Christ tell us this? I think He does it partly to comfort His
   ministers. Oh, it is heart-breaking work to keep on preaching Christ to
   sinners who will not come to Him, holding up Christ before eyes that
   see no beauty in Him, praising Him to ears that are not charmed with
   the music of His name! So our Master says to us, "My servants, you
   shall not labor in vain, nor spend your strength for nothing. 'All that
   the Father gives Me shall come to Me.' If all those who were first
   invited to the great Gospel feast make excuses for not coming, others
   will accept My invitation and the feast shall be fully furnished with
   guests. If scribes and Pharisees still reject Me, publicans and harlots
   will be only too glad to come to

   Me and I will cast out none who come. So still go on, My servants,
   publishing the glad tiding of salvation, for all that My Father gave Me
   must and shall come to Me."

   I think Christ also speaks thus as a rebuff to those who seem to
   imagine that Christ's work will be a failure if they do not come to
   Him! You know how many talk, nowadays, about the Gospel being
   old-fashioned, worn out and not adapted to this enlightened age! Oh,
   yes, Sir, I know what you think and how you talk! But are you foolish
   enough to suppose that Christ's great Sacrifice on Calvary will prove
   to have been offered in vain just because you refuse to trust to it? Oh
   no, "He shall see of the travail of His soul and shall be satisfied."
   Here is a poor silly fly drowning in a glass of water. He might as well
   imagine that his dying struggles would convulse all the empires of the
   earth as an atheist might think that he can demolish the whole system
   of Christianity by the nonsensical whimsies that he harbors in his
   stupid brain! I tell you, Man, that you cannot frustrate the eternal
   purposes of God, or rob His Son of a single grain of His Glory! What if
   you will not come to Christ? He never expected that you would come, so
   He will not be surprised or disappointed! But if you will not come to
   Him, others will. If you will not enlist in the army of the Cross and
   join the innumerable hosts that rally round His blood-stained banner,
   others will, and the great Son of David will never lack brave soldiers
   who will do and dare for Him more than even David's mighty men did for
   their royal leader! Voltaire said that he lived in the twilight of
   Christianity, but if so, it was the twilight of the morning, not of the
   evening! Julian the apostate vowed that he would put down the Nazarene,
   but his dying cry was, "O Galilean, You have conquered!" Yes, and so He
   always will--and they who oppose and reject Him will find that the
   stone which the builders refused will become the cornerstone in the
   great Temple of His Church--and also a stone of stumbling and a rock of
   offense to those who reject Him! Woe be unto those upon whom that Stone
   shall fall, for it will grind them to powder!

   I think that Jesus also intended these words, "All that the Father
   gives Me shall come to Me," to be a cause for jubilation in the hearts
   of His people. We often feel very sad concerning the times in which we
   live and there is more than enough to make us sigh and cry because of
   the abominations and iniquities in the world and, alas, because of the
   many evils in the professing church! But those who love the Lord and
   seek to serve Him are not left without many consolations and
   compensations. The purposes of God shall all be fulfilled! There shall
   not be one soul the less in Heaven notwithstanding all that Romanism,
   Ritualism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Mohammedanism and every other ism
   may do! Christ shall not be robbed of the reward of His soul-travail by
   anything that infidelity can do! Satan may rage and roar, and all his
   legions may come up from the bottomless Pit and league themselves with
   wicked men to overthrow the Church of God, but founded upon the Rock,
   "the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it." The kings and rulers
   of the earth may take counsel together against the Lord and against His
   Anointed, but "He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall
   have them in derision." And when the history of this poor little planet
   is finished, it shall be found that Christ was speaking nothing but the
   truth when He said, "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me."

   III. Now I come to the last and perhaps the sweetest part of the whole
   discourse, which is to be concerning THE

   FULLNESS AND FREENESS OF DIVINE GRACE--ALL WHO COME BY THIS ONE WAY
   SHALL BE SAVED!

   "Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out.

   This means that everyone who comes to Christ shall certainly be saved,
   for, if Christ will not cast him out, nobody else can do so! As soon as
   ever he comes to Christ, he is accepted (not repelled) by Christ! And
   being accepted by Christ, he is saved with an everlasting
   salvation--and there is no power on earth or in Hell that can ever make
   him into an unsaved man after Christ has saved him!

   "But," says someone, "suppose he comes to Christ and then finds that he
   is not one of those who were given to Christ by His Father?" You must
   not suppose what never can be true, for there never was a sinner yet
   who came to Christ who was not first given to Christ! All who come to
   Christ are Divinely drawn to Him and no one is drawn to Him without
   having been from all eternity given to Him--so there is nothing in our
   friend's supposition that ought to be a stumbling block in the way of
   any seeking sinner here! I am quite certain that God has an elect
   people, for He tells me so in His Word. And I am equally certain that
   everyone who comes to Christ shall be saved, for that also is His own
   declaration in the Scriptures! When people ask me how I reconcile these
   two Truths of God, I usually say that there is no need to reconcile
   them, for they have never yet quarreled with one another! Both are true
   and both relate to the same persons, for those who come to Christ are
   those who were from eternity given to Christ by His Father!

   Jesus Christ still says to us, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise
   cast out." "But, Lord," objects someone, "this man's life has been an
   outrageously bad one! Will You accept him if he comes to You?" "Oh,
   yes! 'Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out.'" "But, Lord, he
   has been an habitual drunk and he has also been a great blasphemer."
   Well, suppose you were obliged to add that he has been an adulterer, a
   liar, a thief, a perjurer, or even a murderer? Jesus Christ would still
   say, "'Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out.' Whatever his
   past character may have been, if he truly repents of his sin and trusts
   in My atoning blood to cleanse him from all his guilt, his sins and
   iniquities shall be remembered against him no more, forever." If I had
   the biggest, blackest sinner in the whole world here, I would say to
   him or to her, "My dear Friend, if you will here and now trust in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, the one and only Savior of sinners, I can assure
   you, on the authority of God, Himself, that 'though your sins are as
   scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though your sins are red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool.' And that your sins, which are many,
   are all forgiven! And then, like the woman in the city who was a
   notorious public sinner, you will love Christ much because you have
   been forgiven much."

   "Ah," says some poor sinner here, "but I do not feel that I have
   repented enough. I do not feel that my heart is tender enough. I do not
   feel that I have wept enough over my many offenses." Stop a moment,
   Friend. If you have your Bible open, or if not, listen while I read the
   text again--"All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me; and him
   that comes to me I will in no wise cast out." Is there anything in
   Christ's words about how much you are to feel Is there anything at all
   about your feelings Not a word! Not even a syllable! If you but come to
   Christ, which means if you but trust Him, if you rely upon His finished
   work, if you truthfully say, as we often sing--

   "Ido believe, I will believe,

   That Jesus died for me!

   That on the Cross He shed His blood

   From sin to set me free"--

   then that glorious "Gospel in miniature"--as Martin Luther called it,
   applies to you as well as to every other sinner who believes in
   Jesus--"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son,
   that whoever believes in Him s hould not perish, but have everlasting
   life." There is nothing in that verse about feelings--everything
   depends upon faith! And then when you have believed in Jesus, right
   feelings will be given to you by God's good Spirit. Gratitude, love,
   joy, hope, peace, courage, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness,
   temperance and every other "fruit of the Spirit" will spring from the
   blessed root-Grace of faith in Jesus! And so you shall have yet further
   confirmation of the fact that you are saved for the Lord's own test is,
   "By their fruits you shall know them."

   Possibly there is someone here, on this last Sabbath night of another
   year, who is saying to himself, "I hardly know why I came into this
   building tonight, for I have been everything that I ought not to have
   been--and nothing that I ought to have been." But, Friend, do you
   desire to begin a new life even before the new year dawns on you? Are
   you willing to leave your sins? Do you long to be a holy man? In a
   word, is it the one wish of your heart that you may be saved? Then I
   refer you, also, to my text and remind you that the Lord Jesus Christ
   said, "him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out." There is
   nothing there to shut out the most irreligious man if he will but come
   to Christ! You say that you are an odd man--well, I have often said and
   others have said that I am an odd man--a lot that cannot be put in any
   catalog! You are self-condemned and so was I before I came to Christ.
   You feel that you are, as George Whitefield used to say, one of the
   devil's castaways--so bad that even Satan, himself, would not claim
   you! Why, you and I ought to shake hands, for that is just how I felt
   when that poor local preacher pointed to me and said, "Look, young man,
   look! Jesus Christ says to you, "Look unto Me and be you saved, all the
   ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else." I did look,
   and was saved by the same Gospel I preach to you! And as this is the
   last Sabbath night in another year, and as it may be the last Gospel
   invitation you will ever have the opportunity of hearing, I repeat to
   you the very last invitations recorded in the Word of God, "The Spirit
   and the bride say, Come, and let him that hears say, Come. And let him
   that is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him take the water of life
   freely." This agrees with John 3:16 which I have already quoted to you,
   and it also agrees with Christ's words in our text, "Him that comes to
   Me." John Bunyan said that meant any "him" in all the world--"I will in
   no wise cast out"--that is, for no reason, for no conceivable motive,
   for no possible cause will Christ cast out one who comes to Him by
   faith! "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out" is a grand old
   An-

   glo-Saxon expression that sweeps round the man who comes to Christ and
   guards him like a sword of fire protecting him from every possibility
   of being cast out by Christ!

   What do you say, My Hearers, to all this? I have pleaded with some of
   you hundreds of times and now, in this, my last Sabbath message for the
   year, I ask you once again--Will you come to Christ? When will you
   come? Tomorrow? That means never, for tomorrow never comes. By-and-by?
   That means that you do not intend to come to Christ at all! The text is
   in the present tense, "him that comes to me," for, "now is the accepted
   time. Behold, now is the day of salvation." Trust in Jesus now, Sinner!
   Trust your soul to Him as you trust your money to your banker and your
   body to your doctor! "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved." Oh, that the Holy Spirit may enable you to say, at this moment,
   "This is a sinner's salvation and, as I am a sinner, it exactly suits
   my case! I accept it, My Lord, praising and blessing You that I, a
   poor, foul, lost, condemned sinner coming to You, am saved--saved now
   and saved forever! Glory be unto Your holy name! Amen!"

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 11:1-26.

   1. Andit came topass, that as He waspraying in a certain place, when He
   ceased, one ofHis disciples said unto Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as
   John also taught his disciples. It seemed to this disciple as if he did
   not know how to pray after he had heard Christ pray. The prayer of
   Jesus was so infinitely above anything that he had ever reached that he
   said, "Lord, teach us to pray." And as if he felt that he needed a
   precedent for asking such hallowed instruction, he said, "Teach us to
   pray, as John also taught his disciples." We must all feel that if we
   are to pray aright, we must be taught of God, by his Holy Spirit. We
   are full of infirmities and if there is any time when our infirmities
   are felt most, it is when we engage in prayer, but "the Spirit also
   helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we
   ought." Let us, then, breathe this prayer to our great Teacher, "Lord,
   teach us to pray."

   2. And He said to them, When you pray, say, Our Father which are in
   Heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, as
   in Heaven, so in earth. When we come to God in prayer, we are apt to
   think first of our own necessities, but if we came aright, in the
   spirit of sonship, truly saying, "Our Father who are in Heaven," we
   should begin our prayer like this, "'Hallowed be Your name.' May all
   men honor, reverence, and adore Your holy name. 'Your kingdom come.' We
   are not satisfied that You should be anything less than King! Our
   heart's desire is, 'Reign, gracious God over us and over all men.'
   'Your will be done, as in Heaven, so in earth.' 'Your will be done,'
   rather than ours." Now comes a prayer for ourselves--

   3. Give us day by day our daily bread."Give us, O Lord, what we really
   need--not that which would be a luxury, but that which is a necessity.
   'Give us,' according as we shall need it day by day, what we shall then
   actually need--'our daily bread.'" We are not warranted in asking much
   more than this in temporal matters. They are all comprehended in this
   petition as far as they are necessary, but God has not given us carte
   blanche to ask for wealth, or honor, or any such dangerous things.
   There is no harm in asking for bread--and He will give us that.

   4. And forgive us our sins.We also need to pray this prayer. I do not
   think that our Savior ever anticipated a time when His disciples on
   earth would not need to pray, "Forgive us our sins."

   4. For we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us. And lead us not
   into temptation. "Lord, do not try us and test us more than is
   absolutely necessary, for we are so apt to fall! 'Lead us not into
   temptation,' but if we must be tempted"--

   4. Deliver us from evil."If some good end is to be answered by our
   being thus tested, then let it be so, but, O Lord, 'deliver us from
   evil,' and especially from the Evil One--do not allow us to fall into
   his hands in the hour of temptation."

   5, 6. And He said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall
   go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lendme three loaves;
   for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, andIhave nothing to
   set before him. This man was in a sad plight--his friend was faint and
   hungry and he was willing enough to entertain him, but he had "nothing
   to set before him." So he acts very wisely--he goes to a friend, and
   asks him to lend him three loaves.

   7. And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is
   now shut and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give to
   you. If the man outside keeps on knocking. If he will not go away
   without the bread he wants for his friend, what will happen?

   8. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give to him, because he
   is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him
   as many as he needs. See the power of importunate prayer? And you,
   Beloved, can have all that you really need for yourselves or others if
   you will only ask for it in the right way. If, summoning every faculty
   of your being, you resolve to plead, and plead, and plead yet again and
   again, and never take, "No," for an answer, your heart's desire shall
   be granted!

   9. And I say unto you, ask, andit shall be given you. But if asking
   does not seem to prevail with God-- 9. Seek, and you shall find. And
   if, for a while, you do not find, come closer in--

   9. Knock, andit shall be opened unto you. There are different methods
   of praying and each one has its special adaptation to the state in
   which you may be--so use that method to which the Holy Spirit guides
   you--so use all methods until you prevail.

   10, 11. For everyone that asks receives, and he that seeks finds; and
   to him that knocks it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any
   of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?There were many
   stones in those days that were in appearance wonderfully like the bread
   which they used in the East, but would any father mock his son by
   giving him one of those stones to break his teeth, instead of bread
   that he could eat? Never!

   11-13. Or ifhe asks for a fish, willhe for a fish give him a serpent?
   Orifhe shallaskfor an egg, willhe offer him a scorpion? If you, then,
   being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much
   more shall your heavenly

   Father give the Holy Spirit to them that asks Him? [See Sermon #959,
   Volume 16--RIGHT REPLIES TO RIGHT REQUESTS.] If you have the Holy
   Spirit, you virtually have all good gifts, for the Spirit is the
   earnest of God's Love, the pledge of joys to come! And He brings with
   Him all things that are necessary and good for you!

   14. And He was casting out a devil, and it was dumb.So that this poor
   man could not obey the Savior's teaching. He could not pray, for he was
   under the influence of a dumb devil. How many of that sort there are
   still in the world! They cannot speak with God, they have never learned
   to pray, for they are possessed by a dumb devil!

   14. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke;
   and the people wondered. When the devil is driven out of men by Christ,
   they soon begin to pray. The little sentence, "Behold, he prays," was
   the indication of a new birth in Saul of Tarsus. The Lord grant that
   some here who have been possessed by a dumb spirit, may be graciously
   led to pray! Remember, dear Friend, that God will hear your prayer the
   first time you call upon Him--and there is a text which says, "Before
   they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will
   hear."

   15. But some of them said, He casts out devils through Beelzebub, the
   chief of the devils. They could not have uttered a fouler lie than
   this! And if people thus slandered the Lord Jesus Christ, we need not
   be surprised if they speak ill of us!

   16. And others, tempting Him, sought of Him a sign from Heaven.Yet they
   had a very striking one in the dumb devil being cast out of the man!
   What clearer sign than that could they have?

   17. 18. But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom
   divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided
   against a house fails. If Satan also is divided against himself how
   shall his kingdom stand? Because you say that I cast out devils through
   Beelzebub.If Satan cast out Satan, his kingdom would soon come to an
   end! Note how calmly the Savior met these mockers and quibblers. There
   is no trace of anger in His words--they said the worst thing they could
   say about Him and His work and yet, in the coolest manner possible, He
   closes their mouths in the silence of shame. God grant us Grace to be
   calm and strong even when we are most furiously assailed! It is when we
   are in a hurry and fret that we grow weak.

   19-23. And if I, by Beelzebub, cast out devils, by whom do your sons
   cast them out? Therefore shall they be your judges. But if I, with the
   finger of God, cast out devils, no doubt the Kingdom of God is come
   upon you. When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in
   peace: but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome
   him, he takes from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divides
   his spoils. He that is not with Me is against Me: and he that gathers
   not with Me, scatters.Christ had made no compact with the powers of
   darkness! He was not casting the demons out with the devil's aid--it
   was absurd to think that He was! He was fighting them and casting them
   out by His own Divine, Omnipotent energy. Now comes a very striking
   parable--

   24. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man--Satan does,
   sometimes, go out of men entirely of his own accord without being
   turned out. He goes out for a walk, meaning to go back again. Many a
   man has left off being a drunk, or left off being lascivious--for a
   time--"when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man"--

   24. He walks through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he
   says, I will return unto my house--You see that he still calls it
   hishouse. He has gone out for a walk, but he has taken the keys of his
   house with him. Some people sign the pledge and give up being drunks
   for a time, but if the devil is still their master, he has only gone
   away for a while, and he will come back again before long. If he goes
   out of his own accord, he will come back when he pleases--"I will
   return unto my house"--

   24, 26. From where I came out. And when he comes, he finds it swept and
   garnishe. The man has become quite a decent sort of fellow! He has
   given up his bad ways and is a respectable member of society. The house
   is swept and garnished, but it is the devil's house all the same!

   26. Then goes he, and takes to him even other spirits more wicked than
   himself, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that
   man is worse than the first [See Sermon #613, Volume 11--"the strong
   one driven out by a stronger one."] There are, alas, many who have only
   a sham conversion, a conversion which lasts but a very little while.
   The devil was not cast out of them, but he went out of his own accord.
   But where Christ has come--the One who is far stronger than the
   devil--to cast him out of his house, the devil will never be allowed to
   come back again, Christ will take care of that! Having won the victory
   and taken the house, he will keep it by force of arms. But beware, I
   pray you, of a "conversion" without Christ! Beware of a "reformation"
   in which the devil, himself, is a co-worker with you, for it will come
   to something worse in the end! Let me read the verse again--"Then goes
   he, and takes to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and
   they enter in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse
   than the first." He becomes a worse man than ever because once he
   promised to be better, but only promised it in his own strength, which
   was utter weakness!
