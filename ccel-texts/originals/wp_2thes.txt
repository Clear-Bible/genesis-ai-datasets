  2 Thessalonians

A.T. Robertson
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 1

   1:1 Paul, etc. [Paulos, etc.]. This address or superscription is
   identical with that in 1Th 1:1 save that our [hemOn] is added after
   Father [patri].

   1:2 From God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ [apo theou patros kai
   Kuriou Iesou Christou]. These words are not genuine in 1Th 1:1, but are
   here and they appear in all the other Pauline Epistles. Note absence of
   article both after [en] and [apo], though both God and Lord Jesus
   Christ are definite. In both cases Jesus Christ is put on a par with
   God, though not identical. See on 1Th 1:1 for discussion of words, but
   note difference between [en], in the sphere of, by the power of, and
   [apo], from, as the fountain head and source of grace and peace.

   1:3 We are bound [opheilomen]. Paul feels a sense of obligation to keep
   on giving thanks to God [eucharistein tOi theOi], present infinitive
   with dative case) because of God's continued blessings on the
   Thessalonians. He uses the same idiom again in 2:13 and nowhere else in
   his thanksgivings. It is not necessity [dei] that Paul here notes, but
   a sense of personal obligation as in 1Jo 2:6 (Milligan). Even as it is
   meet [kathOs axion estin]. [Opheilomen] points to the divine, [axion]
   to the human side of the obligation (Lightfoot), perhaps to cheer the
   fainthearted in a possible letter to him in reply to Paul's First
   Thessalonian epistle (Milligan). This adjective [axios] is from [agO],
   to drag down the scales, and so weighty, worthy, worthwhile, old word
   and appropriate here. For that your faith groweth exceedingly [hoti
   huperauxanei he pistis humOn]. Causal use of [hoti] referring to the
   obligation stated in [opheilomen]. The verb [huperauxanO] is one of
   Paul's frequent compounds in [huper] [huper-bainO], 1Th 4:6;
   [huper-ek-teinO], 2Co 10:14; [huper-en-tugchanO], Ro 8:26;
   [huper-nikaO], Ro 8:37; [huper-pleonazO], 1Ti 1:14) and occurs only
   here in N.T. and rare elsewhere (Galen, Dio Cass.). Figure of the tree
   of faith growing above [huper] measure. Cf. parable of Jesus about
   faith-like a grain of mustard seed (Mt 13:31f.). Aboundeth [pleonazei].
   Same verb in 1Th 3:12, here a fulfilment of the prayer made there.
   Milligan finds diffusive growth of love in this word because of "each
   one" [henos hekastou]. Frame finds in this fulfilment of the prayer of
   1Th 3:12 one proof that II Thessalonians is later than I Thessalonians.

   1:4 So that [hOste]. Another example of [hOste] and the infinitive
   [enkauchasthai] for result as in 1Th 1:7 which see. We ourselves
   [autous hemas]. Accusative of general reference with the infinitive,
   but not merely [hemas] (or [heautous], perhaps in contrast with [en
   humin] (in you), as much as to say, "so that we ourselves, contrary to
   your expectations, are boasting" (Frame). [Enkauchaomai] occurs here
   alone in N.T., but is found in the LXX and in Aesop's Fables, proof
   enough of its vernacular use. Paul was not above praising one church to
   other churches, to provoke them to good works. Here he is boasting of
   Thessalonica in Macedonia to the Corinthians as he did later to the
   Corinthians about the collection (2Co 8:1-15) after having first
   boasted to the Macedonians about the Corinthians (2Co 9:1-5). There
   were other churches in Achaia besides Corinth (2Co 1:1). For [huper].
   Over, about, like [peri] (1Th 1:2). In all your persecutions [en pasin
   tois diOgmois humOn]. Their patience and faith had already attracted
   Paul's attention (1Th 1:3) and their tribulations [thlipsesin] (1Th
   1:6). Here Paul adds the more specific term [diOgmos], old word from
   [diOkO], to chase, to pursue, a word used by Paul of his treatment in
   Corinth (2Co 12:10). Which ye endure [hais anechesthe]. B here reads
   [enechesthe], to be entangled in, to be held in as in Ga 5:1, but
   [anechesthe] is probably correct and the [hais] is probably attracted
   to locative case of [thlipsesin] from the ablative [hOn] after
   [anechesthe], from which ye hold yourselves back (cf. Col 3:13).

   1:5 A manifest token of the righteous judgment of God [endeigma tes
   dikaias kriseOs tou theou]. Old word from [endeiknumi], to point out,
   result reached [-ma], a thing proved. It is either in the accusative of
   general reference in apposition with the preceding clause as in Ro 8:3;
   12:1, or in the nominative absolute when [ho estin], if supplied, would
   explain it as in Php 1:28. This righteous judgment is future and final
   (verses 6-10). To the end that you may be counted worthy [eis to
   kataxiOthenai humas]. Another example of [eis to] for purpose with
   first aorist passive infinitive from [kataxioO], old verb, with
   accusative of general reference [humas] and followed by the genitive
   [tes basileias] (kingdom of God). See 1Th 2:12 for kingdom of God. For
   which ye also suffer [huper hes kai paschete]. Ye also as well as we
   and the present tense means that it is still going on.

   1:6 If so be that it is a righteous thing with God [eiper dikaion para
   theOi]. Condition of first class, determined as fulfilled, assumed as
   true, but with [eiper] (if on the whole, provided that) as in Ro 8:9,
   17, and with no copula expressed. A righteous thing "with God" means by
   the side of God [para theOi] and so from God's standpoint. This is as
   near to the idea of absolute right as it is possible to attain. Note
   the phrase in verse 5. To recompense affliction to them that afflict
   you [antapodounai tois thlibousin hemas thlipsin]. Second aorist active
   infinitive of double compound [ant-apodidOmi], old verb, either in good
   sense as in 1Th 3:9 or in bad sense as here. Paul is certain of this
   principle, though he puts it conditionally.

   1:7 Rest with us [anesin meth' hemOn]. Let up, release. Old word from
   [aniemi], from troubles here (2Co 2:13; 7:5; 8:13), and hereafter as in
   this verse. Vivid word. They shared suffering with Paul (verse 5) and
   so they will share [meth'] the rest. At the revelation of the Lord
   Jesus [en tei apokalupsei tou Kuriou Iesou]. Here the [Parousia] (1Th
   2:19; 3:13; 5:23) is pictured as a Revelation (Un-veiling,
   [apo-kalupsis] of the Messiah as in 1Co 1:7, 1Pe 1:7, 13 (cf. Lu
   17:30). At this Unveiling of the Messiah there will come the recompense
   (verse 6) to the persecutors and the rest from the persecutions. This
   Revelation will be from heaven [ap' ouranou] as to place and with the
   angels of his power [met' aggelOn dunameOs autou] as the retinue and in
   flaming fire [en puri phlogos], in a fire of flame, fire characterized
   by flame). In Ac 7:30 the text is flame of fire where [puros] is
   genitive (like Isa 66:15) rather than [phlogos] as here (Ex 3:2).

   1:8 Rendering [didontos]. Genitive of present active participle of
   [didOmi], to give, agreeing with [Iesou]. Vengeance [ekdikesin]. Late
   word from [ekdikeO], to vindicate, in Polybius and LXX. To them that
   know not God [tois me eidosin theon]. Dative plural of perfect active
   participle [eidOs]. Apparently chiefly Gentiles in mind (1Th 4:3; Ga
   4:8; Ro 1:28; Eph 2:12), though Jews are also guilty of wilful
   ignorance of God (Ro 2:14). And to them that obey not the gospel of our
   Lord Jesus [kai tois me hupakouousin tOi euaggeliOi tou kuriou hemOn
   Iesou]. Repetition of the article looks like another class and so Jews
   (Ro 10:16). Both Jews as instigators and Gentiles as officials
   [politarchs] were involved in the persecution in Thessalonica (Ac
   17:5-9; 2Th 1:6). Note the use of "gospel" here as in Mr 1:15 "believe
   in the gospel."

   1:9 Who [hoitines]. Qualitative use, such as. Vanishing in papyri
   though surviving in Paul (1Co 3:17; Ro 1:25; Ga 4:26; Php 4:3). Shall
   suffer punishment [diken tisousin]. Future active of old verb [tinO],
   to pay penalty [diken], right, justice), here only in N.T., but
   [apotinO] once also to repay Phm 1:19. In the papyri [dike] is used for
   a case or process in law. This is the regular phrase in classic writers
   for paying the penalty. Eternal destruction [olethron aiOnion].
   Accusative case in apposition with [diken] (penalty). This phrase does
   not appear elsewhere in the N.T., but is in IV Macc. 10:15 [ton aiOnion
   tou turannou olethron] the eternal destruction of the tyrant (Antiochus
   Epiphanes). Destruction (cf. 1Th 5:3) does not mean here annihilation,
   but, as Paul proceeds to show, separation from the face of the Lord
   [apo prosOpou tou kuriou] and from the glory of his might [kai apo tes
   doxes tes ischuos autou], an eternity of woe such as befell Antiochus
   Epiphanes. [AiOnios] in itself only means age-long and papyri and
   inscriptions give it in the weakened sense of a Caesar's life
   (Milligan), but Paul means by age-long the coming age in contrast with
   this age, as eternal as the New Testament knows how to make it. See on
   Mt 25:46 for use of [aiOnios] both with [zOen], life, and [kolasin],
   punishment.

   1:10 When he shall come [hotan elthei]. Second aorist active
   subjunctive with [hotan], future and indefinite temporal clause
   (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 971ff.) coincident with [en tei apokalupsei]
   in verse 7. To be glorified [endoxasthenai]. First aorist passive
   infinitive (purpose) of [endoxazO], late verb, in N.T. only here and
   verse 12, in LXX and papyri. In his saints [en tois hagiois autou]. The
   sphere in which Christ will find his glory at the Revelation. And to be
   marvelled at [kai thaumasthenai]. First aorist passive infinitive
   (purpose), common verb [thaumazO]. That believed [tois pisteusasin].
   Why aorist active participle instead of present active [pisteuousin]
   (that believe)? Frame thinks that Paul thus reassures those who
   believed his message when there (1Th 1:6ff.; 2:13f.). The parenthetical
   clause, though difficult, falls in with this idea: Because our
   testimony unto you was believed [hoti episteuthe to marturion hemOn
   eph' humas]. Moffatt calls it an anti-climax. On that day [en tei
   hemerai ekeinei]. The day of Christ's coming (2Ti 1:12, 18; 4:8).

   1:11 To which end [eis ho]. So Col 1:29. Probably purpose with
   reference to the contents of verses 5-10. We have had the Thanksgiving
   (verses 3-10) in a long, complicated, but rich period or sentence. Now
   he makes a brief Prayer (verses 11-12) that God will fulfil all their
   hopes and endeavours. Paul and his colleagues can still pray for them
   though no longer with them (Moffatt). That [hina]. Common after
   [proseuchomai] (Col 4:3; Eph 1:17; Php 1:9) when the content of the
   prayer blends with the purpose (purport and purpose). Count you worthy
   [humas axiOsei]. Causative verb (aorist active subjunctive) like
   [kataxioO] in verse 5 with genitive. Of your calling [tes kleseOs].
   [Klesis] can apply to the beginning as in 1Co 1:26; Ro 11:29, but it
   can also apply to the final issue as in Php 3:14; Heb 3:1. Both ideas
   may be here. It is God's calling of the Thessalonians. And fulfil every
   desire of goodness [kai plerOsei pasan eudokian agathOsunes]. "Whom he
   counts worthy he first makes worthy" (Lillie). Yes, in purpose, but the
   wonder and the glory of it all is that God begins to count us worthy in
   Christ before the process is completed in Christ (Ro 8:29f.). But God
   will see it through and so Paul prays to God. [Eudokia] (cf. Lu 2:14)
   is more than mere desire, rather good pleasure, God's purpose of
   goodness, not in ancient Greek, only in LXX and N.T. [AgathOsune] like
   a dozen other words in [-sune] occurs only in late Greek. This word
   occurs only in LXX, N.T., writings based on them. It is made from
   [agathos], good, akin to [agamai], to admire. May the Thessalonians
   find delight in goodness, a worthy and pertinent prayer. Work of faith
   [ergon pisteOs]. The same phrase in 1Th 1:3. Paul prays for rich
   fruition of what he had seen in the beginning. Work marked by faith,
   springs from faith, sustained by faith. With power [en dunamei]. In
   power. Connect with [plerOsei] (fulfil), God's power (Ro 1:29; Col 1:4)
   in Christ (1Co 1:24) through the Holy Spirit (1Th 1:5).

   1:12 That [hopOs]. Rare with Paul compared with [hina] (1Co 1:29; 2Co
   8:14). Perhaps here for variety (dependent on [hina] clause in verse
   11). The name [to onoma]. The Old Testament (LXX) uses [onoma]
   embodying the revealed character of Jehovah. So here the Name of our
   Lord Jesus means the Messiahship and Lordship of Jesus. The common
   Greek idiom of [onoma] for title or dignity as in the papyri (Milligan)
   is not quite this idiom. The papyri also give examples of [onoma] for
   person as in O.T. and Ac 1:15 (Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 196ff.).
   In you, and ye in him [en humin, kai humeis en autOi]. This reciprocal
   glorying is Pauline, but it is also like Christ's figure of the vine
   and the branches in Joh 15:1-11. According to the grace [kata ten
   charin]. Not merely standard, but also aim (Robertson, Grammar, p.
   609). Of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ [tou theou hemOn kai kuriou
   Iesou Christou]. Here strict syntax requires, since there is only one
   article with [theou] and [kuriou] that one person be meant, Jesus
   Christ, as is certainly true in Tit 2:13; 2Pe 1:1 (Robertson, Grammar,
   p.786). This otherwise conclusive syntactical argument, admitted by
   Schmiedel, is weakened a bit by the fact that [Kurios] is often
   employed as a proper name without the article, a thing not true of
   [sOter] in Tit 2:13; 2Pe 1:1. So in Eph 5:5 [en tei basileiai tou
   Christou kai theou] the natural meaning is in the Kingdom of Christ and
   God regarded as one, but here again [theos], like [Kurios], often
   occurs as a proper name without the article. So it has to be admitted
   that here Paul may mean "according to the grace of our God and the Lord
   Jesus Christ," though he may also mean "according to the grace of our
   God and Lord, Jesus Christ."

Chapter 2

   2:1 Touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ [huper tes parousias
   tou Kuriou (hemOn) Iesou Christou]. For [erOtOmen], to beseech, see on
   1Th 4:1; 4:12. [Huper] originally meant over, in behalf of, instead of,
   but here it is used like [peri], around, concerning as in 1:4; 1Th 3:2;
   5:10, common in the papyri (Robertson, Grammar, p. 632). For the
   distinction between [Parousia, Epiphaneia] (Epiphany), and
   [Apokalupsis] (Revelation) as applied to the Second Coming of Christ
   see Milligan on Thessalonian Epistles, pp. 145-151, in the light of the
   papyri. [Parousia] lays emphasis on the presence of the Lord with his
   people, [epiphaneia] on his manifestation of the power and love of God,
   [apokalupsis] on the revelation of God's purpose and plan in the Second
   Coming of the Lord Jesus. And our gathering together unto him [kai
   hemOn episunagOges ep' auton]. A late word found only in II Macc. 2:7;
   2Th 2:1; Heb 10:25 till Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, p. 103)
   found it on a stele in the island of Syme, off Caria, meaning
   "collection." Paul is referring to the rapture, mentioned in 1Th
   4:15-17, and the being forever with the Lord thereafter. Cf. also Mt
   24:31; Mr 13:27.

   2:2 To the end that [eis to]. One of Paul's favourite idioms for
   purpose, [eis to] and the infinitive. Ye be not quickly shaken [me
   tacheOs saleuthenai humas]. First aorist passive infinitive of
   [saleuO], old verb to agitate, to cause to totter like a reed (Mt
   11:7), the earth (Heb 12:26). Usual negative [me] and accusative of
   general reference [humas] with the infinitive. From your mind [apo tou
   noos]. Ablative case of nous, mind, reason, sober sense, "from your
   witte" (Wyclif), to "keep their heads." Nor yet be troubled [mede
   throeisthai]. Old verb [throeO], to cry aloud (from [throos], clamour,
   tumult), to be in a state of nervous excitement (present passive
   infinitive, as if it were going on), "a continued state of agitation
   following the definite shock received [saleuthenai]" (Milligan). Either
   by spirit [mete dia pneumatos]. By ecstatic utterance (1Th 5:10). The
   nervous fear that the coming was to be at once prohibited by [mede]
   Paul divides into three sources by [mete, mete, mete]. No individual
   claim to divine revelation (the gift of prophecy) can justify the
   statement. Or by word [mete dia logou]. Oral statement of a
   conversation with Paul (Lightfoot) to this effect as from us. An easy
   way to set aside Paul's first Epistle by report of a private remark
   from Paul. Or by epistle as from us [mete di' epistoles hOs di' hemOn].
   In 1Th 4:13-5:3 Paul had plainly said that Jesus would come as a thief
   in the night and had shown that the dead would not be left out in the
   rapture. But evidently some one claimed to have a private epistle from
   Paul which supported the view that Jesus was coming at once, as that
   the day of the Lord is now present [hOs hoti enesteken he hemera tou
   kuriou]. Perfect active indicative of [enistemi], old verb, to place
   in, but intransitive in this tense to stand in or at or near. So "is
   imminent" (Lightfoot). The verb is common in the papyri. In 1Co 3:22;
   Ro 8:38 we have a contrast between [ta enestOta], the things present,
   and [ta mellonta], the things future (to come). The use of [hOs hoti]
   may be disparaging here, though that is not true in 2Co 5:19. In the
   Koine it comes in the vernacular to mean simply "that" (Moulton,
   Proleg., p. 212), but that hardly seems the case in the N.T.
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1033). Here it means "to wit that," though "as
   that" or "as if" does not miss it much. Certainly it flatly denies that
   by conversation or by letter he had stated that the second coming was
   immediately at hand. "It is this misleading assertion that accounts
   both for the increased discouragement of the faint-hearted to encourage
   whom Paul writes 1:3-2:17, and for the increased meddlesomeness of the
   idle brethren to warn whom Paul writes 3:1-18" (Frame). It is enough to
   give one pause to note Paul's indignation over this use of his name by
   one of the over-zealous advocates of the view that Christ was coming at
   once. It is true that Paul was still alive, but, if such a "pious
   fraud" was so common and easily condoned as some today argue, it is
   difficult to explain Paul's evident anger. Moreover, Paul's words
   should make us hesitate to affirm that Paul definitely proclaimed the
   early return of Jesus. He hoped for it undoubtedly, but he did not
   specifically proclaim it as so many today assert and accuse him of
   misleading the early Christians with a false presentation.

   2:3 Let no man beguile you in any wise [me tis humas exapatesei kata
   medena tropon]. First aorist active subjunctive of [exapataO] (old verb
   to deceive, strengthened form of simple verb [apataO] with double
   negative [me tis, medena] in accord with regular Greek idiom as in 1Co
   16:11 rather than the aorist imperative which does occur sometimes in
   the third person as in Mr 13:15 [me katabatO]. Paul broadens the
   warning to go beyond conversation and letter. He includes "tricks" of
   any kind. It is amazing how gullible some of the saints are when a new
   deceiver pulls off some stunts in religion. For it will not be [hoti].
   There is an ellipse here of [ouk estai] (or [genesetai] to be supplied
   after [hoti]. Westcott and Hort make an anacoluthon at the end of verse
   4. The meaning is clear. [Hoti] is causal, because, but the verb is
   understood. The second coming not only is not "imminent," but will not
   take place before certain important things take place, a definite
   rebuff to the false enthusiasts of verse 2. Except the falling away
   come first [ean me elthei he apostasia prOton]. Negative condition of
   the third class, undetermined with prospect of determination and the
   aorist subjunctive. [Apostasia] is the late form of [apostasis] and is
   our word apostasy. Plutarch uses it of political revolt and it occurs
   in I Macc. 2:15 about Antiochus Epiphanes who was enforcing the
   apostasy from Judaism to Hellenism. In Jos 22:22 it occurs for
   rebellion against the Lord. It seems clear that the word here means a
   religious revolt and the use of the definite article [he] seems to mean
   that Paul had spoken to the Thessalonians about it. The only other New
   Testament use of the word is in Ac 21:21 where it means apostasy from
   Moses. It is not clear whether Paul means revolt of the Jews from God,
   of Gentiles from God, of Christians from God, or of the apostasy that
   includes all classes within and without the body of Christians. But it
   is to be first [prOton] before Christ comes again. Note this adverb
   when only two events are compared (cf. Ac 1:1). And the man of sin be
   revealed, the son of perdition [kai apokaluphthei ho anthrOpos tes
   anomias, ho huios tes apOleias]. First aorist passive subjunctive after
   [ean me] and same condition as with [elthei]. The use of this verb
   [apokaluptO], like [apokalupsin] of the second coming in 1:7, seems to
   note the superhuman character (Milligan) of the event and the same verb
   is repeated in verses 6, 8. The implication is that the man of sin is
   hidden somewhere who will be suddenly manifested just as false apostles
   pose as angels of light (2Co 11:13ff.), whether the crowning event of
   the apostasy or another name for the same event. Lightfoot notes the
   parallel between the man of sin, of whom sin is the special
   characteristic (genitive case, a Hebraism for the lawless one in verse
   8) and Christ. Both Christ and the adversary of Christ are revealed,
   there is mystery about each, both make divine claims (verse 4). He
   seems to be the Antichrist of 1Jo 2:18. The terrible phrase, the son of
   perdition, is applied to Judas in Joh 17:12 (like Judas doomed to
   perdition), but here to the lawless one [ho anomos], verse 8), who is
   not Satan, but some one definite person who is doing the work of Satan.
   Note the definite article each time.

   2:4 He that opposeth and exalteth himself [ho antikeimenos kai
   huperairomenos]. Like John's Antichrist this one opposes [anti-] Christ
   and exalts himself (direct middle of [huperairO], old verb to lift
   oneself up above others, only here and 2Co 12:7 in N.T.), but not
   Satan, but an agent of Satan. This participial clause is in apposition
   with the two preceding phrases, the man of sin, the son of perdition.
   Note 1Co 8:5 about one called God and Ac 17:23 for [sebasma] (from
   [sebazomai], object of worship, late word, in N.T. only in these two
   passages. So that he sitteth in the temple of God [hOste auton eis ton
   naon tou theou kathisai]. Another example of the infinitive with
   [hOste] for result. Caius Caligula had made a desperate attempt to have
   his statue set up for worship in the Temple in Jerusalem. This incident
   may lie behind Paul's language here. Setting himself forth as God
   [apodeiknunta heauton hoti estin theos]. Present active participle [mi]
   form) of [apodeiknumi], agreeing in case with [auton], showing himself
   that he is God. Caligula claimed to be God. Moffatt doubts if Paul is
   identifying this deception with the imperial cultus at this stage.
   Lightfoot thinks that the deification of the Roman emperor supplied
   Paul's language here. Wetstein notes a coin of Julius with [theos] on
   one side and [ThessalonikeOn] on the other. In 1Jo 2:18 we are told of
   "many antichrists" some of whom had already come. Hence it is not clear
   that Paul has in mind only one individual or even individuals at all
   rather than evil principles, for in verse 6 he speaks of [to katechon]
   (that which restraineth) while in verse 7 it is [ho katechOn] (the one
   that restraineth). Frame argues for a combination of Belial and
   Antichrist as the explanation of Paul's language. But the whole subject
   is left by Paul in such a vague form that we can hardly hope to clear
   it up. It is possible that his own preaching while with them gave his
   readers a clue that we do not possess.

   2:5 When I was yet with you [eti On pros humas]. The present participle
   takes the time of the verb [elegon] (imperfect active), I used to tell
   you these things. So Paul recalls their memory of his words and leaves
   us without the clue to his idea. We know that one of the charges
   against him was that Jesus was another king, a rival to Caesar (Ac
   17:7). That leads one to wonder how far Paul went when there in
   contrasting the kingdom of the world of which Rome was ruler and the
   kingdom of God of which Christ is king. Frame notes Paul's abrupt
   question here "with an unfinished sentence behind him" (verses 3f.),
   even "with a trace of impatience."

   2:6 That which restraineth [to katechon]. And now you know [kai nun
   oidate], says Paul in this cryptic apocalyptic passage. Unfortunately
   we do not know what Paul means by that which restrains (holds back,
   [katechon], neuter here and masculine in verse 7 [ho katechOn]. "This
   impersonal principle or power is capable also of manifesting itself
   under a personal form" (Milligan). "He is Satan's messiah, an infernal
   caricature of the true Messiah" (Moffatt). Warfield (Expositor, III,
   iv, pp. 30ff.) suggested that the man of lawlessness is the imperial
   line with its rage for deification and that the Jewish state was the
   restraining power. But God overrules all human history and his ultimate
   purpose is wrought out. To the end that [eis to]. Another example of
   [eis to] and the infinitive for purpose. In his own season [en tOi
   autou kairOi]. Note [autou] (his), not [heautou] (his own), revealed in
   his time, in the time set him by God.

   2:7 For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work [to gar musterion
   ede energeitai tes anomias]. See 1Th 2:13 for [energeitai]. The
   genitive [tes anomias] (lawlessness) describes [to musterion] (note
   emphatic position of both). This mystery [musterion] secret, from
   [mustes], an initiate, [mueO], to wink or blink) means here the secret
   purpose of lawlessness already at work, the only instance of this usage
   in the N.T. where it is used of the kingdom of God (Mt 13:11), of God
   (1Co 2:1) and God's will (Eph 1:9), of Christ (Eph 3:4), of the gospel
   (Eph 6:9), of faith (1Ti 3:9), of godliness (1Ti 3:16), of the seven
   stars (Re 1:20), of the woman (Re 17:7). But this secret will be
   "revealed" and then we shall understand clearly what Paul's meaning is
   here. Until he be taken out of the way [heOs ek mesou genetai]. Usual
   construction with [heOs] for the future (aorist middle subjunctive,
   [genetai]. Note absence of [an] as often in N.T. and the [Koine]. Paul
   uses [heOs] only here and 1Co 4:5. When the obstacle is removed then
   the mystery of lawlessness will be revealed in plain outline.

   2:8 And then [kai tote]. Emphatic note of time, then when the
   restraining one [ho katechOn] is taken out of the way, then [the
   lawless one] [ho anomos], the man of sin, the man of perdition, will be
   revealed. Whom the Lord [Jesus] shall slay [hon ho kurios [Iesous]
   anelei]. Whether Jesus is genuine or not, he is meant by Lord. [Anelei]
   is a late future from [anaireO], in place of [anairesei]. Paul uses Isa
   11:4 (combining by the word of his mouth with in breath through lips)
   to picture the triumph of Christ over this adversary. It is a powerful
   picture how the mere breath of the Lord will destroy this arch-enemy
   (Milligan). And bring to naught by the manifestation of his coming [kai
   katargesei tei epiphaneiai tes parousias autou]. This verb [katargeO]
   [kata, argos] to render useless, rare in ancient Greek, appears 25
   times in Paul and has a variety of renderings. In the papyri it has a
   weakened sense of hinder. It will be a grand fiasco, this advent of the
   man of sin. Paul here uses both [epiphaneia] [epiphany], elsewhere in
   N.T. in the Pastorals, familiar to the Greek mind for a visit of a god)
   and [parousia] (more familiar to the Jewish mind, but common in the
   papyri) of the second coming of Christ. "The apparition of Jesus
   heralds his doom" (Moffatt). The mere appearance of Christ destroys the
   adversary (Vincent).

   2:9 Whose coming is [hou estin he parousia]. Refers to [hon] in verse
   8. The Antichrist has his [parousia] also. Deissmann (Light from the
   Ancient East, pp. 374, 378) notes an inscription at Epidaurus in which
   "Asclepius manifested his [Parousia]." Antiochus Epiphanes is called
   the manifest god (III Macc. 5:35). So the two Epiphanies coincide.
   Lying wonders [terasin pseudous]. "In wonders of a lie." Note here the
   three words for the miracles of Christ (Heb 2:4), power [dunamis],
   signs [semeia], wonders [terata], but all according to the working of
   Satan [kata energeian tou Satana], the energy of Satan) just as Jesus
   had foretold (Mt 24:24), wonders that would almost lead astray the very
   elect.

   2:10 With all deceit of unrighteousness [en pasei apatei adikias]. This
   pastmaster of trickery will have at his command all the energy and
   skill of Satan to mislead and deceive. How many illustrations lie along
   the pathway of Christian history. For them that are perishing [tois
   apollumenois]. Dative case of personal interest. Note this very phrase
   in 2Co 2:15; 4:3. Present middle participle of [appollumi], to destroy,
   the dreadful process goes on. Because [anth' hon]. In return for which
   things [anti] and the genitive of the relative pronoun). Same idiom in
   Lu 1:20; 12:3; 19:44; Ac 12:23 and very common in the LXX. The love of
   the truth [ten agapen tes aletheias]. That is the gospel in contrast
   with lying and deceit. That they might be saved [eis to sOthenai
   autous]. First aorist passive infinitive of [sOzO] with [eis to],
   again, epexegetic purpose of the truth if they had heeded it.

   2:11 And for this reason God sendeth them [kai dia touto pempei autois
   ho theos]. Futuristic (prophetic) present of the time when the lawless
   one is revealed. Here is the definite judicial act of God (Milligan)
   who gives the wicked over to the evil which they have deliberately
   chosen (Ro 1:24, 26, 28). A working of error [energeian planes].
   Terrible result of wilful rejection of the truth of God. That they
   should believe a lie [eis to pisteusai autous tOi pseudei]. Note [eis
   to] again and [tOi pseudei] (the lie, the falsehood already described),
   a contemplated result. Note Ro 1:25 "who changed the truth of God into
   the lie."

   2:12 That they all might be judged [hina krithOsin pantes]. First
   aorist passive subjunctive of [krinO], to sift, to judge, with [hina].
   Ultimate purpose, almost result, of the preceding obstinate resistance
   to the truth and "the judicial infatuation which overtakes them"
   (Lightfoot), now final punishment. Condemnation is involved in the
   fatal choice made. These victims of the man of sin did not believe the
   truth and found pleasure in unrighteousness.

   2:13 See 1:3 for same beginning. Beloved of the Lord [egapemenoi hupo
   kuriou]. Perfect passive participle of [agapaO] with [hupo] and the
   ablative as in 1Th 1:4, only here [kuriou] instead of [theou], the Lord
   Jesus rather than God the Father. Because that God chose you [hoti
   heilato humas ho theos]. First aorist middle indicative of [haireO], to
   take, old verb, but uncompounded only in N.T. here, Php 1:22; Heb
   11:25, and here only in sense of choose, that being usually
   [exaireomai] or [proorizO]. From the beginning [ap' arches]. Probably
   the correct text (Aleph D L) and not [aparchen] (first fruits, B G P),
   though here alone in Paul's writings and a hard reading, the eternal
   choice or purpose of God (1Co 2:7; Eph 1:4; 2Ti 1:9), while [aparchen]
   is a favourite idea with Paul (1Co 15:20, 23; 16:15; Ro 8:23; 11:16;
   16:5). Unto salvation [eis sOterian]. The ultimate goal, final
   salvation. In sanctification of the Spirit [en hagiasmOi pneumatos].
   Subjective genitive [pneumatos], sanctification wrought by the Holy
   Spirit. And belief of the truth [kai pistei aletheias]. Objective
   genitive [aletheias], belief in the truth.

   2:14 Whereunto [eis ho]. The goal, that is the final salvation
   [sOteria]. Through our gospel [dia tou euaggeliou hemOn]. God called
   the Thessalonians through Paul's preaching as he calls men now through
   the heralds of the Cross as God chose (cf. 1Th 2:12; 5:24). To the
   obtaining [eis peripoiesin]. Probably correct translation rather than
   possession. See on 1Th 5:9, there of salvation, here of glory (the
   shekinah, glory of Jesus).

   2:15 So then [ara oun]. Accordingly then. The illative [ara] is
   supported (Ellicott) by the collective [oun] as in 1Th 5:6; Ga 6:10,
   etc. Here is the practical conclusion from God's elective purpose in
   such a world crisis. Stand fast [stekete]. Present imperative active of
   the late present [steko] from [hesteka] (perfect active of [histemi].
   See on 1Th 3:8. Hold the traditions [krateite tas paradoseis]. Present
   imperative of [krateO], old verb, to have masterful grip on a thing,
   either with genitive (Mr 1:31) or usually the accusative as here.
   [Paradosis] (tradition) is an old word for what is handed over to one.
   Dibelius thinks that Paul reveals his Jewish training in the use of
   this word (Ga 1:14), but the word is a perfectly legitimate one for
   teaching whether oral, by word [dia logou], or written, by epistle of
   ours [di' epistoles hemOn]. Paul draws here no distinction between oral
   tradition and written tradition as was done later. The worth of the
   tradition lies not in the form but in the source and the quality of the
   content. Paul in 1Co 11:23 says: "I received from the Lord what I also
   handed over [paredOka] unto you." He praises them because ye "hold fast
   the traditions even as I delivered them unto you." The tradition may be
   merely that of men and so worthless and harmful in place of the word of
   God (Mr 7:8; Col 2:6-8). It all depends. It is easy to scoff at truth
   as mere tradition. But human progress in all fields is made by use of
   the old, found to be true, in connection with the new if found to be
   true. In Thessalonica the saints were already the victims of
   theological charlatans with their half-baked theories about the second
   coming of Christ and about social duties and relations. Which ye were
   taught [has edidachthete]. First aorist passive indicative of
   [didaskO], to teach, retaining the accusative of the thing in the
   passive as is common with this verb like doceO in Latin and teach in
   English.

   2:16 And God our Father [kai [ho] theos ho pater hemOn]. It is
   uncertain whether the first article [ho] is genuine as it is absent in
   B D. Usually Paul has the Father before Christ except here, 2Co 13:13;
   Ga 1:1. Which loved us [ho agapesas hemas]. This singular articular
   participle refers to [ho pater], "though it is difficult to see how St.
   Paul could otherwise have expressed his thought, if he had intended to
   refer to the Son, as well as to the Father. There is probably no
   instance in St. Paul of a plural adjective or verb, when the two
   Persons of the Godhead are mentioned" (Lightfoot). Eternal comfort
   [paraklesin aiOnian]. Distinct feminine form of [aiOnios] here instead
   of masculine as in Mt 25:46.

   2:17 Comfort and stablish [parakalesai kai sterixai]. First aorist
   active optative of wish for the future of two common verbs [parakaleO]
   (see on 1Th 3:7; 4:18; 5:14) and [sterizO] (see on 1Th 3:2, 13). God is
   the God of comfort (2Co 1:3-7) and strength (Ro 1:11; 16:25).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3

   3:1 Finally [to loipon]. Accusative of general reference. Cf. [loipon]
   1Th 4:1. Pray [proseuchesthe]. Present middle, keep on praying. Note
   [peri] as in 1Th 5:25. That the word of the Lord may run and be
   glorified [hina ho logos tou kuriou trechei kai doxazetai]. Usual
   construction of [hina] after [proseuchomai], sub-final use, content and
   purpose combined. Note present subjunctive with both verbs rather than
   aorist, may keep on running and being glorified, two verbs joined
   together nowhere else in the N.T. Paul probably derived this metaphor
   from the stadium as in 1Co 9:24ff.; Ga 2:2; Ro 9:16; Php 2:16; 2Ti 4:7.
   Lightfoot translates "may have a triumphant career." On the word of the
   Lord see on 1Th 1:8. Paul recognizes the close relation between himself
   and the readers. He needs their prayers and sympathy and he rejoices in
   their reception of the word of the Lord already, even as also it is
   with you [kathOs kai pros humas]. "As it does in your case" (Frame).

   3:2 And that we may be delivered [kai hina rusthOmen]. A second and
   more personal petition (Milligan). First aorist passive subjunctive of
   [ruomai], old verb to rescue. Note change in tense from present to
   aorist (effective aorist). From unreasonable and evil men [apo tOn
   atopOn kai ponerOn anthrOpOn]. Ablative case with [apo]. Originally in
   the old Greek [atopos] [a] privative and [topos] is out of place, odd,
   unbecoming, perverse, outrageous, both of things and persons. [Poneros]
   is from [poneO], to work [ponos], looking on labour as an annoyance,
   bad, evil. Paul had a plague of such men in Corinth as he had in
   Thessalonica. For all have not faith [ou gar pantOn he pistis]. Copula
   [estin] not expressed. [PantOn] is predicate possessive genitive, faith
   (article with abstract substantive) does not belong to all. Hence their
   evil conduct.

   3:3 But the Lord is faithful [pistos de estin ho kurios]. But faithful
   is the Lord (correct rendition), with a play (paronomasia) on [pistis]
   by [pistos] as in Ro 3:3 we have a word-play on [apisteO] and
   [apistia]. The Lord can be counted on, however perverse men may be.
   From the evil one [apo tou ponerou]. Apparently a reminiscence of the
   Lord's Prayer in Mt 6:13 [rusai hemas apo tou ponerou]. But here as
   there it is not certain whether [tou ponerou] is neuter (evil) like to
   [poneron] in Ro 12:9 or masculine (the evil one). But we have [ho
   poneros] (the evil one) in 1Jo 5:18 and [tou ponerou] is clearly
   masculine in Eph 6:16. If masculine here, as is probable, is it "the
   Evil One" (Ellicott) or merely the evil man like those mentioned in
   verse 2? Perhaps Paul has in mind the representative of Satan, the man
   of sin, pictured in 2:1-12, by the phrase here without trying to be too
   definite.

   3:4 And we have confidence [pepoithomen]. Second perfect indicative of
   [peithO], to persuade, intransitive in this tense, we are in a state of
   trust. In the Lord touching you [en kuriOi eph' humas]. Note the two
   prepositions, [en] in the sphere of the Lord (1Th 4:1) as the ground of
   Paul's confident trust, [eph'] [epi] with the accusative (towards you)
   where the dative could have been used (cf. 2Co 2:3). Ye both do and
   will do [[kai] poieite kai poiesete]. Compliment and also appeal,
   present and future tenses of [poieO]. The things which we command [ha
   paraggellomen]. Note of apostolic authority here, not advice or urging,
   but command.

   3:5 Direct [kateuthunai]. First aorist active optative of wish for the
   future as in 2:17; 1Th 5:23 from [kateuthunO], old verb, as in 1Th 3:11
   (there way, here hearts) and Lu 1:79 of feet [podas]. Perfective use of
   [kata]. Bold figure for making smooth and direct road. The Lord here is
   the Lord Jesus. Into the love of God [eis ten agapen tou theou]. Either
   subjective or objective genitive makes sense and Lightfoot pleads for
   both, "not only as an objective attribute of deity, but as a ruling
   principle in our hearts," holding that it is "seldom possible to
   separate the one from the other." Most scholars take it here as
   subjective, the characteristic of God. Into the patience of Christ [eis
   ten hupomnen tou Christou]. There is the same ambiguity here, though
   the subjective idea, the patience shown by Christ, is the one usually
   accepted rather than "the patient waiting for Christ" (objective
   genitive).

   3:6 Now we command you [paraggellomen de humin]. Paul puts into
   practice the confidence expressed on their obedience to his commands in
   verse 4. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [en onomati tou kuriou
   Iesou Christou]. Name [onoma] here for authority of Jesus Christ with
   which compare through the Lord Jesus [dia tou kuriou Iesou] in 1Th 4:2.
   For a full discussion of the phrase see the monograph of W. Heitmuller,
   Im Namen Jesu. Paul wishes his readers to realize the responsibility on
   them for their obedience to his command. That ye withdraw yourselves
   [stellesthai humas]. Present middle (direct) infinitive of [stellO],
   old verb to place, arrange, make compact or shorten as sails, to move
   oneself from or to withdraw oneself from (with [apo] and the ablative).
   In 2Co 8:20 the middle voice [stellomenoi] means taking care. From
   every brother that walketh disorderly [apo pantos adelphou ataktOs
   peripatountos]. He calls him "brother" still. The adverb [ataktOs] is
   common in Plato and is here and verse 11 alone in the N.T., though the
   adjective [ataktos], equally common in Plato we had in 1Th 5:14 which
   see. Military term, out of ranks. And not after the tradition [kai me
   kata ten paradosin]. See on 2:15 for [paradosin]. Which they received
   of us [hen parelabosan par hemOn]. Westcott and Hort put this form of
   the verb (second aorist indicative third person plural of
   [paralambanO], the [-osan] form instead of [-on], with slight support
   from the papyri, but in the LXX and the Boeotian dialect, Robertson,
   Grammar, pp. 335f.) in the margin with [parelabete] (ye received) in
   the text. There are five different readings of the verb here, the
   others being [parelabon, parelabe, elabosan].

   3:7 How ye ought to imitate us [pOs dei mimeisthai hemas]. Literally,
   how it is necessary to imitate us. The infinitive [mimeisthai] is the
   old verb [mimeomai] from [mimos] (actor, mimic), but in N.T. only here
   (and verse 9), Heb 13:7; 3Jo 1:11. It is a daring thing to say, but
   Paul knew that he had to set the new Christians in the midst of Jews
   and Gentiles a model for their imitation (Php 3:17). For we behaved not
   ourselves disorderly among you [hoti ouk etaktesamen en humin]. First
   aorist active indicative of old verb [atakteO], to be out of ranks of
   soldiers. Specific denial on Paul's part in contrast to verse 6, 17.

   3:8 For nought [dOrean]. Adverbial accusative, as a gift, gift-wise
   [dOrea], gift, from [didOmi]. Same claim made to the Corinthians (2Co
   11:7), old word, in LXX, and papyri. He lodged with Jason, but did not
   receive his meals gratis, for he paid for them. Apparently he received
   no invitations to meals. Paul had to make his financial independence
   clear to avoid false charges which were made in spite of all his
   efforts. To eat bread is merely a Hebraism for eat (verse 10). See 1Th
   2:9 for labour and travail, and night and day [nuktos kai hemeras],
   genitive of time, by night and by day). See 1Th 2:9 for rest of the
   verse in precisely the same words.

   3:9 Not because we have not the right [ouch hoti ouk echomen exousian].
   Paul is sensitive on his right to receive adequate support (1Th 2:6; 1
   Co 9:4 where he uses the same word [exousian] in the long defence of
   this right, 1Co 9:1-27). So he here puts in this limitation to avoid
   misapprehension. He did allow churches to help him where he would not
   be misunderstood (2Co 11:7-11; Php 4:45f.). Paul uses [ouch hoti]
   elsewhere to avoid misunderstanding (2Co 1:24; 3:5; Php 4:17). But to
   make ourselves an ensample unto you [all' hina heautous tupon dOmen
   humin]. Literally, but that we might give ourselves a type to you.
   Purpose with [hina] and second aorist active subjunctive of [didOmi].
   On [tupon] see on 1Th 1:7.

   3:10 This [touto]. What he proceeds to give. If any will not work,
   neither let him eat [hoti ei tis ou thelei ergazesthai mede esthietO].
   Recitative [hoti] here not to be translated, like our modern quotation
   marks. Apparently a Jewish proverb based on Ge 3:19. Wetstein quotes
   several parallels. Moffatt gives this from Carlyle's Chartism: "He that
   will not work according to his faculty, let him perish according to his
   necessity." Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, p. 314) sees Paul
   borrowing a piece of workshop morality. It was needed, as is plain.
   This is a condition of the first class (note negative [ou] with the
   negative imperative in the conclusion.

   3:11 For we hear [akouomen gar]. Fresh news from Thessalonica
   evidently. For the present tense compare 1Co 11:18. The accusative and
   the participle is a regular idiom for indirect discourse with this verb
   (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1040-2). Three picturesque present
   participles, the first a general description, [peripatountas ataktOs],
   the other two specifying with a vivid word-play, that work not at all,
   but are busy-bodies [meden ergazomenous alla periergazomenous].
   Literally, doing nothing but doing around. Ellicott suggests, doing no
   business but being busy bodies. "The first persecution at Thessalonica
   had been fostered by a number of fanatical loungers (Ac 17:5)"
   (Moffatt). These theological dead-beats were too pious to work, but
   perfectly willing to eat at the hands of their neighbours while they
   piddled and frittered away the time in idleness.

   3:12 We command and exhort [paraggellomen kai parakaloumen]. Paul
   asserts his authority as an apostle and pleads as a man and minister.
   That with quietness they work, and eat their own bread [hina meta
   hesuchias ergazomenoi ton heautOn arton esthiOsin]. Substance of the
   command and exhortation by [hina] and the present subjunctive
   [esthiOsin]. Literally, that working with quietness they keep on eating
   their own bread. The precise opposite of their conduct in verse 11.

   3:13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing [humeis de, adelphoi,
   me enkakesete kalopoiountes]. Emphatic position of [humeis] in contrast
   to these piddlers. [Me] and the aorist subjunctive is a prohibition
   against beginning an act (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 851-4). It is a late
   verb and means to behave badly in, to be cowardly, to lose courage, to
   flag, to faint, [en, kakos] and outside of Lu 18:1 in the N.T. is only
   in Paul's Epistles (2Th 3:13; 2Co 4:1, 16; Ga 6:9; Eph 3:13). It occurs
   in Polybius. The late verb [kalopoieO], to do the fair [kalos] or
   honourable thing occurs nowhere else in the N.T., but is in the LXX and
   a late papyrus. Paul uses [to kalon poiein] in 2Co 13:7; Ga 6:9; Ro
   7:21 with the same idea. He has [agathopoieO], to do good, in 1Ti 6:18.

   3:14 And if any one obeyeth not our word by this epistle [ei de tis
   ouch hupakouei tOi logOi hemOn dia tes epistoles]. Paul sums up the
   issue bluntly with this ultimatum. Condition of the first class, with
   negative [ou], assuming it to be true. Note that man [touton
   semeiousthe]. Late verb [semeioO], from [semeion], sign, mark, token.
   Put a tag on that man. Here only in N.T. "The verb is regularly used
   for the signature to a receipt or formal notice in the papyri and the
   ostraca of the Imperial period" (Moulton & Milligan's Vocabulary). How
   this is to be done (by letter or in public meeting) Paul does not say.
   That ye have no company with him [me sunanamignusthai autOi]. The MSS.
   are divided between the present middle infinitive as above in a command
   like Ro 12:15; Php 3:16 or the present middle imperative
   [sunanamignusthe] [-ai] and [-e] often being pronounced alike in the
   Koine). The infinitive can also be explained as an indirect command.
   This double compound verb is late, in LXX and Plutarch, in N.T. only
   here and 1Co 5:9, 11. [AutOi] is in associative instrumental case. To
   the end that he may be ashamed [hina entrapei]. Purpose clause with
   [hina]. Second aorist passive subjunctive of [entrepO], to turn on,
   middle to turn on oneself or to put to shame, passive to be made
   ashamed. The idea is to have one's thoughts turned in on oneself.

   3:15 Not as an enemy [me hOs echthron]. This is always the problem in
   such ostracism as discipline, however necessary it is at times. Few
   things in our churches are more difficult of wise execution than the
   discipline of erring members. The word [echthros] is an adjective,
   hateful, from [echthos], hate. It can be passive, hated, as in Ro
   11:28, but is usually active hostile, enemy, foe.

   3:16 The Lord of peace himself [autos ho kurios tes eirenes]. See 1Th
   5:23 for the God of peace himself. Give you peace [doie humin ten
   eirenen]. Second aorist active optative (Koine) of [didOmi], not [dOei]
   (subjunctive). So also Ro 15:5; 2Ti 1:16,18. The Lord Jesus whose
   characteristic is peace, can alone give real peace to the heart and to
   the world. (Joh 14:27).

   3:17 Of me Paul with mine own hand [tei emei cheiri Paulou].
   Instrumental case [cheiri]. Note genitive [Paulou] in apposition with
   possessive idea in the possessive pronoun [emei]. Paul had dictated the
   letter, but now wrote the salutation in his hand. The token in every
   epistle [semeion en pasei epistolei]. Mark (verse 14) and proof of the
   genuineness of each epistle, Paul's signature. Already there were
   spurious forgeries (2Th 2:2). Thus each church was enabled to know that
   Paul wrote the letter. If only the autograph copy could be found!

   3:18 Salutation just like that in 1Th 5:28 with the addition of
   [pantOn] (all).
