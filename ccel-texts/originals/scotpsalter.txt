Psalm 1

   8,6,8,6


   ^1That man hath perfect blessedness,

   who walketh not astray

   In counsel of ungodly men,

   nor stands in sinners' way,


   Nor sitteth in the scorner's chair:

   ^2But placeth his delight

   Upon God's law, and meditates

   on his law day and night.


   ^3He shall be like a tree that grows

   near planted by a river,

   Which in his season yields his fruit,

   and his leaf fadeth never:


   And all he doth shall prosper well.

   ^4The wicked are not so;

   But like they are unto the chaff,

   which wind drives to and fro.


   ^5In judgment therefore shall not stand

   such as ungodly are;

   Nor in th' assembly of the just

   shall wicked men appear.


   ^6For why? the way of godly men

   unto the Lord is known:

   Whereas the way of wicked men

   shall quite be overthrown.

Psalm 2

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Why rage the heathen? and vain things

   why do the people mind?

   ^2Kings of the earth do set themselves,

   and princes are combin'd,


   To plot against the Lord, and his

   Anointed, saying thus,

   ^3Let us asunder break their bands,

   and cast their cords from us.


   ^4He that in heaven sits shall laugh;

   the Lord shall scorn them all.

   ^5Then shall he speak to them in wrath,

   in rage he vex them shall.


   ^6Yet, notwithstanding, I have him

   to be my King appointed;

   And over Sion, my holy hill,

   I have him King anointed.


   ^7The sure decree I will declare:

   The Lord hath said to me,

   Thou art mine only Son; this day

   I have begotten thee.


   ^8Ask of me, and for heritage

   the heathen I'll make thine;

   And, for possession, I to thee

   will give earth's utmost line.


   ^9Thou shalt, as with a weighty rod

   of iron, break them all;

   And, as a potter's sherd, thou shalt

   them dash in pieces small.


   ^10Now therefore, kings, be wise; be taught,

   ye judges of the earth:

   ^11Serve God in fear, and see that ye

   join trembling with your mirth.


   ^12Kiss ye the Son, lest in his ire

   ye perish from the way,

   If once his wrath begin to burn:

   bless'd all that on him stay.

Psalm 3

   A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord, how are my foes increas'd?

   against me many rise.

   ^2Many say of my soul, For him

   in God no succour lies.


   ^3Yet thou my shield and glory art,

   th' uplifter of mine head.

   ^4I cry'd, and, from his holy hill,

   the Lord me answer made.


   ^5I laid me down and slept; I wak'd;

   for God sustained me.

   ^6I will not fear though thousands ten

   set round against me be.


   ^7Arise, O Lord; save me, my God;

   for thou my foes hast stroke

   All on the cheek-bone, and the teeth

   of wicked men hast broke.


   ^8Salvation doth appertain

   unto the Lord alone:

   Thy blessing, Lord, for evermore

   thy people is upon.

Psalm 4

   To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Give ear unto me when I call,

   God of my righteousness:

   Have mercy, hear my pray'r; thou hast

   enlarg'd me in distress.


   ^2O ye the sons of men! how long

   will ye love vanities?

   How long my glory turn to shame,

   and will ye follow lies?


   ^3But know, that for himself the Lord

   the godly man doth chuse:

   The Lord, when I on him do call,

   to hear will not refuse.


   ^4Fear, and sin not; talk with your heart

   on bed, and silent be.

   ^5Off rings present of righteousness,

   and in the Lord trust ye.


   ^6O who will shew us any good?

   is that which many say:

   But of thy countenance the light,

   Lord, lift on us alway.


   ^7Upon my heart, bestow'd by thee,

   more gladness I have found

   Than they, ev'n then, when corn and wine

   did most with them abound.


   ^8I will both lay me down in peace,

   and quiet sleep will take;

   Because thou only me to dwell

   in safety, Lord, dost make.
     __________________________________________________________________

Psalm 5

   To the chief Musician, upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Give ear unto my words, O Lord,

   my meditation weigh.

   ^2Hear my loud cry, my King, my God;

   for I to thee will pray.


   ^3Lord, thou shalt early hear my voice:

   I early will direct

   My pray'r to thee; and, looking up,

   an answer will expect.


   ^4For thou art not a God that doth

   in wickedness delight;

   Neither shall evil dwell with thee,

   ^5Nor fools stand in thy sight.


   All that ill-doers are thou hat'st;

   ^6Cutt'st off that liars be:

   The bloody and deceitful man

   abhorred is by thee.


   ^7But I into thy house will come

   in thine abundant grace;

   And I will worship in thy fear

   toward thy holy place.


   ^8Because of those mine enemies,

   Lord, in thy righteousness

   Do thou me lead; do thou thy way

   make straight before my face.


   ^9For in their mouth there is no truth,

   their inward part is ill;

   Their throat's an open sepulchre,

   their tongue doth flatter still.


   ^10O God, destroy them; let them be

   by their own counsel quell'd:

   Them for their many sins cast out,

   for they gainst thee rebell'd.


   ^11But let all joy that trust in thee,

   and still make shouting noise;

   For them thou sav'st; let all that love

   thy name in thee rejoice.


   ^12For, Lord, unto the righteous man

   thou wilt thy blessing yield:

   With favour thou wilt compass him

   about, as with a shield.

Psalm 6

   To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.

First Version (L.M.)

   8,8,8,8


   ^1Lord, in thy wrath rebuke me not;

   Nor in thy hot rage chasten me.

   ^2Lord, pity me, for I am weak:

   Heal me, for my bones vexed be.


   ^3My soul is also vexed sore;

   But, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make?

   ^4Return, O Lord, my soul set free;

   O save me, for thy mercies' sake.


   ^5Because those that deceased are

   Of thee shall no remembrance have;

   And who is he that will to thee

   Give praises lying in the grave?


   ^6I with my groaning weary am,

   I also all the night my bed

   Have caused for to swim; and I

   With tears my couch have watered.


   ^7Mine eye, consum'd with grief, grows old,

   Because of all mine enemies.

   ^8Hence from me, wicked workers all;

   For God hath heard my weeping cries.


   ^9God hath my supplication heard,

   My pray'r received graciously

   ^10Sham'd and sore vex'd be all my foes,

   Sham'd and back turned suddenly.
     __________________________________________________________________

Psalm 6

Second Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1In thy great indignation,

   O Lord, rebuke me not;

   Nor on me lay thy chast ning hand,

   in thy displeasure hot.


   ^2Lord, I am weak, therefore on me

   have mercy, and me spare:

   Heal me, O Lord, because thou know'st

   my bones much vexed are.


   ^3My soul is vexed sore: but, Lord,

   how long stay wilt thou make?

   ^4Return, Lord, free my soul; and save

   me, for thy mercies' sake.


   ^5Because of thee in death there shall

   no more remembrance be:

   Of those that in the grave do lie,

   who shall give thanks to thee?


   ^6I with my groaning weary am,

   and all the night my bed

   I caused for to swim; with tears

   my couch I watered.


   ^7By reason of my vexing grief,

   mine eye consumed is;

   It waxeth old, because of all

   that be mine enemies.


   ^8But now, depart from me all ye

   that work iniquity:

   For why? the Lord hath heard my voice,

   when I did mourn and cry.


   ^9Unto my supplication

   the Lord did hearing give:

   When I to him my prayer make,

   the Lord will it receive.


   ^10Let all be sham'd and troubled sore,

   That en'mies are to me;

   Let them turn back, and suddenly

   ashamed let them be.
     __________________________________________________________________

Psalm 7

   Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the words
   of Cush the Benjamite.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord my God, in thee do I

   my confidence repose:

   Save and deliver me from all

   my persecuting foes;


   ^2Lest that the enemy my soul

   should, like a lion, tear,

   In pieces rending it, while there

   is no deliverer.


   ^3O Lord my God, if it be so

   that I committed this;

   If it be so that in my hands

   iniquity there is:


   ^4If I rewarded ill to him

   that was at peace with me;

   (Yea, ev'n the man that without cause

   my foe was I did free;)


   ^5Then let the foe pursue and take

   my soul, and my life thrust

   Down to the earth, and let him lay

   mine honour in the dust.


   ^6Rise in thy wrath, Lord, raise thyself,

   for my foes raging be;

   And, to the judgment which thou hast

   commanded, wake for me.


   ^7So shall th' assembly of thy folk

   about encompass thee:

   Thou, therefore, for their sakes, return

   unto thy place on high.


   ^8The Lord he shall the people judge:

   my judge, Jehovah, be,

   After my righteousness, and mine

   integrity in me.


   ^9O let the wicked's malice end;

   but stablish stedfastly

   The righteous: for the righteous God

   the hearts and reins doth try.


   ^10In God, who saves th' upright in heart,

   is my defence and stay.

   ^11God just men judgeth, God is wroth

   with ill men ev'ry day.


   ^12If he do not return again,

   then he his sword will whet;

   His bow he hath already bent,

   and hath it ready set:


   ^13He also hath for him prepar'd

   the instruments of death;

   Against the persecutors he

   his shafts ordained hath.


   ^14Behold, he with iniquity

   doth travail, as in birth;

   A mischief he conceived hath,

   and falsehood shall bring forth.


   ^15He made a pit and digg'd it deep,

   another there to take;

   But he is fall'n into the ditch

   which he himself did make.


   ^16Upon his own head his mischief

   shall be returned home;

   His vi'lent dealing also down

   on his own pate shall come.


   ^17According to his righteousness

   the Lord I'll magnify;

   And will sing praise unto the name

   of God that is most high.

Psalm 8

   To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1How excellent in all the earth,

   Lord, our Lord, is thy name!

   Who hast thy glory far advanc'd

   above the starry frame.


   ^2From infants' and from sucklings' mouth

   thou didest strength ordain,

   For thy foes' cause, that so thou might'st

   th' avenging foe restrain.


   ^3When I look up unto the heav'ns,

   which thine own fingers fram'd,

   Unto the moon, and to the stars,

   which were by thee ordain'd;


   ^4Then say I, What is man, that he

   remember'd is by thee?

   Or what the son of man, that thou

   so kind to him should'st be?


   ^5For thou a little lower hast

   him than the angels made;

   With glory and with dignity

   thou crowned hast his head.


   ^6Of thy hands' works thou mad'st him lord,

   all under's feet didst lay;

   ^7All sheep and oxen, yea, and beasts

   that in the field do stray;


   ^8Fowls of the air, fish of the sea,

   all that pass through the same.

   ^9How excellent in all the earth,

   Lord, our Lord, is thy name!
     __________________________________________________________________

Psalm 9

   To the chief Musician upon Muth-labben, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, thee I'll praise with all my heart,

   thy wonders all proclaim.

   ^2In thee, most High, I'll greatly joy,

   and sing unto thy name.


   ^3When back my foes were turn'd, they fell,

   and perish'd at thy sight:

   ^4For thou maintain'dst my right and cause;

   on throne sat'st judging right.


   ^5The heathen thou rebuked hast,

   the wicked overthrown;

   Thou hast put out their names, that they

   may never more be known.


   ^6O en'my! now destructions have

   an end perpetual:

   Thou cities raz'd; perish'd with them

   is their memorial.


   ^7God shall endure for aye; he doth

   for judgment set his throne;

   ^8In righteousness to judge the world,

   justice to give each one.


   ^9God also will a refuge be

   for those that are oppress'd;

   A refuge will he be in times

   of trouble to distress'd.


   ^10And they that know thy name, in thee

   their confidence will place:

   For thou hast not forsaken them

   that truly seek thy face.


   ^11O sing ye praises to the Lord,

   that dwells in Sion hill;

   And all the nations among

   his deeds record ye still.


   ^12When he enquireth after blood,

   he then rememb'reth them:

   The humble folk he not forgets

   that call upon his name.


   ^13Lord, pity me; behold the grief

   which I from foes sustain;

   Ev'n thou, who from the gates of death

   dost raise me up again;


   ^14That I, in Sion's daughters' gates,

   may all thy praise advance;

   And that I may rejoice always

   in thy deliverance.


   ^15The heathen are sunk in the pit

   which they themselves prepar'd;

   And in the net which they have hid

   their own feet fast are snar'd.


   ^16The Lord is by the judgment known

   which he himself hath wrought:

   The sinners' hands do make the snares

   wherewith themselves are caught.


   ^17They who are wicked into hell

   each one shall turned be;

   And all the nations that forget

   to seek the Lord most high.


   ^18For they that needy are shall not

   forgotten be alway;

   The expectation of the poor

   shall not be lost for aye.


   ^19Arise, Lord, let not man prevail;

   judge heathen in thy sight:

   ^20That they may know themselves but men,

   the nations, Lord, affright.
     __________________________________________________________________

Psalm 10

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Wherefore is it that thou, O Lord,

   dost stand from us afar?

   And wherefore hidest thou thyself,

   when times so troublous are?


   ^2The wicked in his loftiness

   doth persecute the poor:

   In these devices they have fram'd

   let them be taken sure.


   ^3The wicked of his heart's desire

   doth talk with boasting great;

   He blesseth him that's covetous,

   whom yet the Lord doth hate.


   ^4The wicked, through his pride of face,

   on God he doth not call;

   And in the counsels of his heart

   the Lord is not at all.


   ^5His ways they always grievous are;

   thy judgments from his sight

   Removed are: at all his foes

   he puffeth with despight.


   ^6Within his heart he thus hath said,

   I shall not moved be;

   And no adversity at all

   shall ever come to me.


   ^7His mouth with cursing, fraud, deceit,

   is fill'd abundantly;

   And underneath his tongue there is

   mischief and vanity.


   ^8He closely sits in villages;

   he slays the innocent:

   Against the poor that pass him by

   his cruel eyes are bent.


   ^9He, lion-like, lurks in his den;

   he waits the poor to take;

   And when he draws him in his net,

   his prey he doth him make.


   ^10Himself he humbleth very low,

   he croucheth down withal,

   That so a multitude of poor

   may by his strong ones fall.


   ^11He thus hath said within his heart,

   The Lord hath quite forgot;

   He hides his countenance, and he

   for ever sees it not.


   ^12O Lord, do thou arise; O God,

   lift up thine hand on high:

   Put not the meek afflicted ones

   out of thy memory.


   ^13Why is it that the wicked man

   thus doth the Lord despise?

   Because that God will it require

   he in his heart denies.


   ^14Thou hast it seen; for their mischief

   and spite thou wilt repay:

   The poor commits himself to thee;

   thou art the orphan's stay.


   ^15The arm break of the wicked man,

   and of the evil one;

   Do thou seek out his wickedness,

   until thou findest none.


   ^16The Lord is King through ages all,

   ev'n to eternity;

   The heathen people from his land

   are perish'd utterly.


   ^17O Lord, of those that humble are

   thou the desire didst hear;

   Thou wilt prepare their heart, and thou

   to hear wilt bend thine ear;


   ^18To judge the fatherless, and those

   that are oppressed sore;

   That man, that is but sprung of earth,

   may them oppress no more.

Psalm 11

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1I in the Lord do put my trust:

   how is it then that ye

   Say to my soul, Flee, as a bird,

   unto your mountain high?


   ^2For, lo, the wicked bend their bow,

   their shafts on string they fit,

   That those who upright are in heart

   they privily may hit.


   ^3If the foundations be destroy'd,

   what hath the righteous done?

   ^4God in his holy temple is,

   in heaven is his throne:


   His eyes do see, his eye-lids try

   ^5men's sons. The just he proves:

   But his soul hates the wicked man,

   and him that vi'lence loves.


   ^6Snares, fire and brimstone, furious storms,

   on sinners he shall rain:

   This, as the portion of their cup,

   doth unto them pertain.


   ^7Because the Lord most righteous doth

   in righteousness delight;

   And with a pleasant countenance

   beholdeth the upright.
     __________________________________________________________________

Psalm 12

   To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Help, Lord, because the godly man

   doth daily fade away;

   And from among the sons of men

   the faithful do decay.


   ^2Unto his neighbour ev'ry one

   doth utter vanity:

   They with a double heart do speak,

   and lips of flattery.


   ^3God shall cut off all flatt'ring lips,

   tongues that speak proudly thus,

   ^4We'll with our tongue prevail, our lips

   are ours: who's lord o'er us?


   ^5For poor oppress'd, and for the sighs

   of needy, rise will I,

   Saith God, and him in safety set

   from such as him defy.


   ^6The words of God are words most pure;

   they be like silver try'd

   In earthen furnace, seven times

   that hath been purify'd.


   ^7Lord, thou shalt them preserve and keep

   for ever from this race.

   ^8On each side walk the wicked, when

   vile men are high in place.
     __________________________________________________________________

Psalm 13

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1How long wilt thou forget me, Lord?

   shall it for ever be?

   O how long shall it be that thou

   wilt hide thy face from me?


   ^2How long take counsel in my soul,

   still sad in heart, shall I?

   How long exalted over me

   shall be mine enemy?


   ^3O Lord my God, consider well,

   and answer to me make:

   Mine eyes enlighten, lest the sleep

   of death me overtake:


   ^4Lest that mine enemy should say,

   Against him I prevail'd;

   And those that trouble me rejoice,

   when I am mov'd and fail'd.


   ^5But I have all my confidence

   thy mercy set upon;

   My heart within me shall rejoice

   in thy salvation.


   ^6I will unto the Lord my God

   sing praises cheerfully,

   Because he hath his bounty shown

   to me abundantly.
     __________________________________________________________________

Psalm 14

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1That there is not a God, the fool

   doth in his heart conclude:

   They are corrupt, their works are vile;

   not one of them doth good.


   ^2Upon men's sons the Lord from heav'n

   did cast his eyes abroad,

   To see if any understood,

   and did seek after God.


   ^3They altogether filthy are,

   they all aside are gone;

   And there is none that doeth good,

   yea, sure there is not one.


   ^4These workers of iniquity

   do they not know at all,

   That they my people eat as bread,

   and on God do not call?


   ^5There fear'd they much; for God is with

   the whole race of the just.

   ^6You shame the counsel of the poor,

   because God is his trust.


   ^7Let Isr'el's help from Sion come:

   when back the Lord shall bring

   His captives, Jacob shall rejoice,

   and Israel shall sing.

Psalm 15

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Within thy tabernacle, Lord,

   who shall abide with thee?

   And in thy high and holy hill

   who shall a dweller be?


   ^2The man that walketh uprightly,

   and worketh righteousness,

   And as he thinketh in his heart,

   so doth he truth express.


   ^3Who doth not slander with his tongue,

   nor to his friend doth hurt;

   Nor yet against his neighbour doth

   take up an ill report.


   ^4In whose eyes vile men are despis'd;

   but those that God do fear

   He honoureth; and changeth not,

   though to his hurt he swear.


   ^5His coin puts not to usury,

   nor take reward will he

   Against the guiltless. Who doth thus

   shall never moved be.

Psalm 16

   Michtam of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, keep me; for I trust in thee.

   ^2To God thus was my speech,

   Thou art my Lord; and unto thee

   my goodness doth not reach:


   ^3To saints on earth, to th' excellent,

   where my delight's all plac'd.

   ^4Their sorrows shall be multiply'd

   to other gods that haste:


   Of their drink-offerings of blood

   I will no off ring make;

   Yea, neither I their very names

   up in my lips will take.


   ^5God is of mine inheritance

   and cup the portion;

   The lot that fallen is to me

   thou dost maintain alone.


   ^6Unto me happily the lines

   in pleasant places fell;

   Yea, the inheritance I got

   in beauty doth excel.


   ^7I bless the Lord, because he doth

   by counsel me conduct;

   And in the seasons of the night

   my reins do me instruct.


   ^8Before me still the Lord I set:

   sith it is so that he

   Doth ever stand at my right hand,

   I shall not moved be.


   ^9Because of this my heart is glad,

   and joy shall be exprest

   Ev'n by my glory; and my flesh

   in confidence shall rest.


   ^10Because my soul in grave to dwell

   shall not be left by thee;

   Nor wilt thou give thine Holy One

   corruption to see.


   ^11Thou wilt me shew the path of life:

   of joys there is full store

   Before thy face; at thy right hand

   are pleasures evermore.

Psalm 17

   A Prayer of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, hear the right, attend my cry,

   unto my pray'r give heed,

   That doth not in hypocrisy

   from feigned lips proceed.


   ^2And from before thy presence forth

   my sentence do thou send:

   Toward these things that equal are

   do thou thine eyes intend.


   ^3Thou prov'dst mine heart, thou visit'dst me

   by night, thou didst me try,

   Yet nothing found'st; for that my mouth

   shall not sin, purpos'd I.


   ^4As for men's works, I, by the word

   that from thy lips doth flow,

   Did me preserve out of the paths

   wherein destroyers go.


   ^5Hold up my goings, Lord, me guide

   in those thy paths divine,

   So that my footsteps may not slide

   out of those ways of thine.


   ^6I called have on thee, O God,

   because thou wilt me hear:

   That thou may'st hearken to my speech,

   to me incline thine ear.


   ^7Thy wondrous loving-kindness show,

   thou that, by thy right hand,

   Sav'st them that trust in thee from those

   that up against them stand.


   ^8As th' apple of the eye me keep;

   in thy wings shade me close

   ^9From lewd oppressors, compassing

   me round, as deadly foes.


   ^10In their own fat they are inclos'd;

   their mouth speaks loftily.

   ^11Our steps they compass'd; and to ground

   down bowing set their eye.


   ^12He like unto a lion is

   that's greedy of his prey,

   Or lion young, which lurking doth

   in secret places stay.


   ^13Arise, and disappoint my foe,

   and cast him down, O Lord:

   My soul save from the wicked man,

   the man which is thy sword.


   ^14From men, which are thy hand, O Lord,

   from worldly men me save,

   Which only in this present life

   their part and portion have.


   Whose belly with thy treasure hid

   thou fill'st: they children have

   In plenty; of their goods the rest

   they to their children leave.


   ^15But as for me, I thine own face

   in righteousness will see;

   And with thy likeness, when I wake,

   I satisfy'd shall be.

Psalm 18

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord, who
   spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord
   delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of
   Saul: And he said,

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength.

   ^2My fortress is the Lord,

   My rock, and he that doth to me

   deliverance afford:


   My God, my strength, whom I will trust,

   a buckler unto me,

   The horn of my salvation,

   and my high tow'r, is he.


   ^3Upon the Lord, who worthy is

   of praises, will I cry;

   And then shall I preserved be

   safe from mine enemy.


   ^4Floods of ill men affrighted me,

   death's pangs about me went;

   ^5Hell's sorrows me environed;

   death's snares did me prevent.


   ^6In my distress I call'd on God,

   cry to my God did I;

   He from his temple heard my voice,

   to his ears came my cry.


   ^7Th' earth, as affrighted, then did shake,

   trembling upon it seiz'd:

   The hills' foundations moved were,

   because he was displeas'd.


   ^8Up from his nostrils came a smoke,

   and from his mouth there came

   Devouring fire, and coals by it

   were turned into flame.


   ^9He also bowed down the heav'ns,

   and thence he did descend;

   And thickest clouds of darkness did

   under his feet attend.


   ^10And he upon a cherub rode,

   and thereon he did fly;

   Yea, on the swift wings of the wind

   his flight was from on high.


   ^11He darkness made his secret place:

   about him, for his tent,

   Dark waters were, and thickest clouds

   of th' airy firmament.


   ^12And at the brightness of that light,

   which was before his eye,

   His thick clouds pass'd away, hailstones

   and coals of fire did fly.


   ^13The Lord God also in the heav'ns

   did thunder in his ire;

   And there the Highest gave his voice,

   hailstones and coals of fire.


   ^14Yea, he his arrows sent abroad,

   and them he scattered;

   His lightnings also he shot out,

   and them discomfited.


   ^15The waters' channels then were seen,

   the world's foundations vast

   At thy rebuke discover'd were,

   and at thy nostrils' blast.


   ^16And from above the Lord sent down,

   and took me from below;

   From many waters he me drew,

   which would me overflow.


   ^17He me reliev'd from my strong foes,

   and such as did me hate;

   Because he saw that they for me

   too strong were, and too great.


   ^18They me prevented in the day

   of my calamity;

   But even then the Lord himself

   a stay was unto me.


   ^19He to a place where liberty

   and room was hath me brought;

   Because he took delight in me,

   he my deliv'rance wrought.


   ^20According to my righteousness

   he did me recompense,

   He me repaid according to

   my hands' pure innocence.


   ^21For I God's ways kept, from my God

   did not turn wickedly.

   ^22His judgments were before me, I

   his laws put not from me.


   ^23Sincere before him was my heart;

   with him upright was I;

   And watchfully I kept myself

   from mine iniquity.


   ^24After my righteousness the Lord

   hath recompensed me,

   After the cleanness of my hands

   appearing in his eye.


   ^25Thou gracious to the gracious art,

   to upright men upright:

   ^26Pure to the pure, froward thou kyth'st

   unto the froward wight.


   ^27For thou wilt the afflicted save

   in grief that low do lie:

   But wilt bring down the countenance

   of them whose looks are high.


   ^28The Lord will light my candle so,

   that it shall shine full bright:

   The Lord my God will also make

   my darkness to be light.


   ^29By thee through troops of men I break,

   and them discomfit all;

   And, by my God assisting me,

   I overleap a wall.


   ^30As for God, perfect is his way:

   the Lord his word is try'd;

   He is a buckler to all those

   who do in him confide.


   ^31Who but the Lord is God? but he

   who is a rock and stay?

   ^32'Tis God that girdeth me with strength,

   and perfect makes my way.


   ^33He made my feet swift as the hinds,

   set me on my high places.

   ^34Mine hands to war he taught, mine arms

   brake bows of steel in pieces.


   ^35The shield of thy salvation

   thou didst on me bestow:

   Thy right hand held me up, and great

   thy kindness made me grow.


   ^36And in my way my steps thou hast

   enlarged under me,

   That I go safely, and my feet

   are kept from sliding free.


   ^37Mine en'mies I pursued have,

   and did them overtake;

   Nor did I turn again till I

   an end of them did make.


   ^38I wounded them, they could not rise;

   they at my feet did fall.

   ^39Thou girdedst me with strength for war;

   my foes thou brought'st down all:


   ^40And thou hast giv'n to me the necks

   of all mine enemies;

   That I might them destroy and slay,

   who did against me rise.


   ^41They cried out, but there was none

   that would or could them save;

   Yea, they did cry unto the Lord,

   but he no answer gave.


   ^42Then did I beat them small as dust

   before the wind that flies;

   And I did cast them out like dirt

   upon the street that lies.


   ^43Thou mad'st me free from people's strife,

   and heathen's head to be:

   A people whom I have not known

   shall service do to me.


   ^44At hearing they shall me obey,

   to me they shall submit.

   ^45Strangers for fear shall fade away,

   who in close places sit.


   ^46God lives, bless'd be my Rock; the God

   of my health praised be.

   ^47God doth avenge me, and subdues

   the people under me.


   ^48He saves me from mine enemies;

   yea, thou hast lifted me

   Above my foes; and from the man

   of vi'lence set me free.


   ^49Therefore to thee will I give thanks

   the heathen folk among;

   And to thy name, O Lord, I will

   sing praises in a song.


   ^50He great deliv'rance gives his king:

   he mercy doth extend

   To David, his anointed one,

   and his seed without end.

Psalm 19

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1The heav'ns God's glory do declare,

   the skies his hand-works preach:

   ^2Day utters speech to day, and night

   to night doth knowledge teach.


   ^3There is no speech nor tongue to which

   their voice doth not extend:

   ^4Their line is gone through all the earth,

   their words to the world's end.


   In them he set the sun a tent;

   ^5Who, bridegroom-like, forth goes

   From's chamber, as a strong man doth

   to run his race rejoice.


   ^6From heav'n's end is his going forth,

   circling to th' end again;

   And there is nothing from his heat

   that hidden doth remain.


   ^7God's law is perfect, and converts

   the soul in sin that lies:

   God's testimony is most sure,

   and makes the simple wise.


   ^8The statutes of the Lord are right,

   and do rejoice the heart:

   The Lord's command is pure, and doth

   light to the eyes impart.


   ^9Unspotted is the fear of God,

   and doth endure for ever:

   The judgments of the Lord are true

   and righteous altogether.


   ^10They more than gold, yea, much fine gold,

   to be desired are:

   Than honey, honey from the comb

   that droppeth, sweeter far.


   ^11Moreover, they thy servant warn

   how he his life should frame:

   A great reward provided is

   for them that keep the same.


   ^12Who can his errors understand?

   O cleanse thou me within

   ^13From secret faults. Thy servant keep

   from all presumptuous sin:


   And do not suffer them to have

   dominion over me:

   Then, righteous and innocent,

   I from much sin shall be.


   ^14The words which from my mouth proceed,

   the thoughts sent from my heart,

   Accept, O Lord, for thou my strength

   and my Redeemer art.

Psalm 20

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Jehovah hear thee in the day

   when trouble he doth send:

   And let the name of Jacob's God

   thee from all ill defend.


   ^2O let him help send from above,

   out of his sanctuary:

   From Sion, his own holy hill,

   let him give strength to thee.


   ^3Let him remember all thy gifts,

   accept thy sacrifice:

   ^4Grant thee thine heart's wish, and fulfil

   thy thoughts and counsel wise.


   ^5In thy salvation we will joy;

   in our God's name we will

   Display our banners: and the Lord

   thy prayers all fulfil.


   ^6Now know I God his king doth save:

   he from his holy heav'n

   Will hear him, with the saving strength

   by his own right hand giv'n.


   ^7In chariots some put confidence,

   some horses trust upon:

   But we remember will the name

   of our Lord God alone.


   ^8We rise, and upright stand, when they

   are bowed down, and fall.

   ^9Deliver, Lord; and let the King

   us hear, when we do call.

Psalm 21

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1The king in thy great strength, O Lord,

   shall very joyful be:

   In thy salvation rejoice

   how veh'mently shall he!


   ^2Thou hast bestowed upon him

   all that his heart would have;

   And thou from him didst not withhold

   whate'er his lips did crave.


   ^3For thou with blessings him prevent'st

   of goodness manifold;

   And thou hast set upon his head

   a crown of purest gold.


   ^4When he desired life of thee,

   thou life to him didst give;

   Ev'n such a length of days, that he

   for evermore should live.


   ^5In that salvation wrought by thee

   his glory is made great;

   Honour and comely majesty

   thou hast upon him set.


   ^6Because that thou for evermore

   most blessed hast him made;

   And thou hast with thy countenance

   made him exceeding glad.


   ^7Because the king upon the Lord

   his confidence doth lay;

   And through the grace of the most High

   shall not be mov'd away.


   ^8Thine hand shall all those men find out

   that en'mies are to thee;

   Ev'n thy right hand shall find out those

   of thee that haters be.


   ^9Like fiery ov'n thou shalt them make,

   when kindled is thine ire;

   God shall them swallow in his wrath,

   devour them shall the fire.


   ^10Their fruit from earth thou shalt destroy,

   their seed men from among:

   ^11For they beyond their might gainst thee

   did plot mischief and wrong.


   ^12Thou therefore shalt make them turn back,

   when thou thy shafts shalt place

   Upon thy strings, made ready all

   to fly against their face.


   ^13In thy great pow'r and strength, O Lord,

   be thou exalted high;

   So shall we sing with joyful hearts,

   thy power praise shall we.

Psalm 22

   To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1My God, my God, why hast thou me

   forsaken? why so far

   Art thou from helping me, and from

   my words that roaring are?


   ^2All day, my God, to thee I cry,

   yet am not heard by thee;

   And in the season of the night

   I cannot silent be.


   ^3But thou art holy, thou that dost

   inhabit Isr'el's praise.

   ^4Our fathers hop'd in thee, they hop'd

   and thou didst them release.


   ^5When unto thee they sent their cry,

   to them deliv'rance came:

   Because they put their trust in thee,

   they were not put to shame.


   ^6But as for me, a worm I am,

   and as no man am priz'd:

   Reproach of men I am, and by

   the people am despis'd.


   ^7All that me see laugh me to scorn;

   shoot out the lip do they;

   They nod and shake their heads at me,

   and, mocking, thus do say,


   ^8This man did trust in God, that he

   would free him by his might:

   Let him deliver him, sith he

   had in him such delight.


   ^9But thou art he out of the womb

   that didst me safely take;

   When I was on my mother's breasts

   thou me to hope didst make.


   ^10And I was cast upon thy care,

   ev'n from the womb till now;

   And from my mother's belly, Lord,

   my God and guide art thou.


   ^11Be not far off, for grief is near,

   and none to help is found.

   ^12Bulls many compass me, strong bulls

   of Bashan me surround.


   ^13Their mouths they open'd wide on me,

   upon me gape did they,

   Like to a lion ravening

   and roaring for his prey.


   ^14Like water I'm pour'd out, my bones

   all out of joint do part:

   Amidst my bowels, as the wax,

   so melted is my heart.


   ^15My strength is like a potsherd dry'd;

   my tongue it cleaveth fast

   Unto my jaws; and to the dust

   of death thou brought me hast.


   ^16For dogs have compass'd me about:

   the wicked, that did meet

   In their assembly, me inclos'd;

   they pierc'd my hands and feet.


   ^17I all my bones may tell; they do

   upon me look and stare.

   ^18Upon my vesture lots they cast,

   and clothes among them share.


   ^19But be not far, O Lord, my strength;

   haste to give help to me.

   ^20From sword my soul, from pow'r of dogs

   my darling set thou free.


   ^21Out of the roaring lion's mouth

   do thou me shield and save:

   For from the horns of unicorns

   an ear to me thou gave.


   ^22I will shew forth thy name unto

   those that my brethren are;

   Amidst the congregation

   thy praise I will declare.


   ^23Praise ye the Lord, who do him fear;

   him glorify all ye

   The seed of Jacob: fear him all

   that Isr'el's children be.


   ^24For he despis'd not nor abhorr'd

   th' afflicted's misery;

   Nor from him hid his face, but heard

   when he to him did cry.


   ^25Within the congregation great

   my praise shall be of thee;

   My vows before them that him fear

   shall be perform'd by me.


   ^26The meek shall eat, and shall be fill'd;

   they also praise shall give

   Unto the Lord that do him seek:

   your heart shall ever live.


   ^27All ends of th' earth remember shall,

   and turn the Lord unto;

   All kindreds of the nations

   to him shall homage do:


   ^28Because the kingdom to the Lord

   doth appertain as his;

   Likewise among the nations

   the Governor he is.


   ^29Earth's fat ones eat, and worship shall:

   all who to dust descend

   Shall bow to him; none of them can

   his soul from death defend.


   ^30A seed shall service do to him;

   unto the Lord it shall

   Be for a generation

   reckon'd in ages all.


   ^31They shall come, and they shall declare

   his truth and righteousness

   Unto a people yet unborn,

   and that he hath done this.

   the quiet waters by.


   ^3My soul he doth restore again;

   and me to walk doth make

   Within the paths of righteousness,

   ev'n for his own name's sake.


   ^4Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,

   yet will I fear none ill:

   For thou art with me; and thy rod

   and staff me comfort still.


   ^5My table thou hast furnished

   in presence of my foes;

   My head thou dost with oil anoint,

   and my cup overflows.


   ^6Goodness and mercy all my life

   shall surely follow me:

Psalm 25

   A Psalm of David.

First Version (S.M.)

   6,6,8,6


   ^1To thee I lift my soul:

   ^2O Lord, I trust in thee:

   My God, let me not be asham'd,

   nor foes triumph o'er me.


   ^3Let none that wait on thee

   be put to shame at all;

   But those that without cause transgress,

   let shame upon them fall.


   ^4Shew me thy ways, O Lord;

   thy paths, O teach thou me:

   ^5And do thou lead me in thy truth,

   therein my teacher be:


   For thou art God that dost

   to me salvation send,

   And I upon thee all the day

   expecting do attend.


   ^6Thy tender mercies, Lord,

   I pray thee to remember,

   And loving-kindnesses; for they

   have been of old for ever.


   ^7My sins and faults of youth

   do thou, O Lord, forget:

   After thy mercy think on me,

   and for thy goodness great.


   ^8God good and upright is:

   the way he'll sinners show.

   ^9The meek in judgment he will guide,

   and make his path to know.


   ^10The whole paths of the Lord

   are truth and mercy sure,

   To those that do his cov'nant keep,

   and testimonies pure.


   ^11Now, for thine own name's sake,

   O Lord, I thee entreat

   To pardon mine iniquity;

   for it is very great.


   ^12What man is he that fears

   the Lord, and doth him serve?

   Him shall he teach the way that he

   shall choose, and still observe.


   ^13His soul shall dwell at ease;

   and his posterity

   Shall flourish still, and of the earth

   inheritors shall be.


   ^14With those that fear him is

   the secret of the Lord;

   The knowledge of his covenant

   he will to them afford.


   ^15Mine eyes upon the Lord

   continually are set:

   For he it is that shall bring forth

   my feet out of the net.


   ^16Turn unto me thy face,

   and to me mercy show;

   Because that I am desolate,

   and am brought very low.


   ^17My heart's griefs are increas'd:

   me from distress relieve.

   ^18See mine affliction and my pain,

   and all my sins forgive.


   ^19Consider thou my foes,

   because they many are;

   And it a cruel hatred is

   which they against me bear.


   ^20O do thou keep my soul,

   do thou deliver me:

   And let me never be asham'd,

   because I trust in thee.


   ^21Let uprightness and truth

   keep me, who thee attend.

   ^22Redemption, Lord, to Israel

   from all his troubles send.

Second Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1To thee I lift my soul, O Lord:

   ^2My God, I trust in thee:

   Let me not be asham'd; let not

   my foes triumph o'er me.


   ^3Yea, let thou none ashamed be

   that do on thee attend:

   Ashamed let them be, O Lord,

   who without cause offend.


   ^4Thy ways, Lord, shew; teach me thy paths:

   ^5Lead me in truth, teach me:

   For of my safety thou art God;

   all day I wait on thee.


   ^6Thy mercies, that most tender are,

   do thou, O Lord, remember,

   And loving-kindnesses; for they

   have been of old for ever.


   ^7Let not the errors of my youth,

   nor sins, remember'd be:

   In mercy, for thy goodness' sake,

   O Lord, remember me.


   ^8The Lord is good and gracious,

   he upright is also:

   He therefore sinners will instruct

   in ways that they should go.


   ^9The meek and lowly he will guide

   in judgment just alway:

   To meek and poor afflicted ones

   he'll clearly teach his way.


   ^10The whole paths of the Lord our God

   are truth and mercy sure,

   To such as keep his covenant,

   and testimonies pure.


   ^11Now, for thine own name's sake, O Lord,

   I humbly thee entreat

   To pardon mine iniquity;

   for it is very great.


   ^12What man fears God? him shall he teach

   the way that he shall chuse.

   ^13His soul shall dwell at ease; his seed

   the earth, as heirs, shall use.


   ^14The secret of the Lord is with

   such as do fear his name;

   And he his holy covenant

   will manifest to them.


   ^15Towards the Lord my waiting eyes

   continually are set;

   For he it is that shall bring forth

   my feet out of the net.


   ^16O turn thee unto me, O God,

   have mercy me upon;

   Because I solitary am,

   and in affliction.


   ^17Enlarg'd the griefs are of mine heart;

   me from distress relieve.

   ^18See mine affliction and my pain,

   and all my sins forgive.


   ^19Consider thou mine enemies,

   because they many are;

   And it a cruel hatred is

   which they against me bear.


   ^20O do thou keep my soul; O God,

   do thou deliver me:

   Let me not be asham'd; for I

   do put my trust in thee.


   ^21O let integrity and truth

   keep me, who thee attend.

   slide therefore shall not I.


   ^2Examine me, and do me prove;

   try heart and reins, O God:

   ^3For thy love is before mine eyes,

   thy truth's paths I have trode.


   ^4With persons vain I have not sat,

   nor with dissemblers gone:

   ^5Th' assembly of ill men I hate;

   to sit with such I shun.


   ^6Mine hands in innocence, O Lord,

   I'll wash and purify;

   So to thine holy altar go,

   and compass it will I:


   ^7That I, with voice of thanksgiving,

   may publish and declare,

   And tell of all thy mighty works,

   that great and wondrous are.


   ^8The habitation of thy house,

   Lord, I have loved well;

   Yea, in that place I do delight

   where doth thine honour dwell.


   ^9With sinners gather not my soul,

   and such as blood would spill:

   ^10Whose hands mischievous plots, right hand

   corrupting bribes do fill.


   ^11But as for me, I will walk on

   in mine integrity:

   Do thou redeem me, and, O Lord,

   be merciful to me.


   ^12My foot upon an even place

   doth stand with stedfastness:

   Within the congregations

   th' Eternal I will bless.

Psalm 27

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1The Lord's my light and saving health,

   who shall make me dismay'd?

   My life's strength is the Lord, of whom

   then shall I be afraid?


   ^2When as mine enemies and foes,

   most wicked persons all,

   To eat my flesh against me rose,

   they stumbled and did fall.


   ^3Against me though an host encamp,

   my heart yet fearless is:

   Though war against me rise, I will

   be confident in this.


   ^4One thing I of the Lord desir'd,

   and will seek to obtain,

   That all days of my life I may

   within God's house remain;


   That I the beauty of the Lord

   behold may and admire,

   And that I in his holy place

   may rev'rently enquire.


   ^5For he in his pavilion shall

   me hide in evil days;

   In secret of his tent me hide,

   and on a rock me raise.


   ^6And now, ev'n at this present time,

   mine head shall lifted be

   Above all those that are my foes,

   and round encompass me:


   Therefore unto his tabernacle

   I'll sacrifices bring

   Of joyfulness; I'll sing, yea, I

   to God will praises sing.


   ^7O Lord, give ear unto my voice,

   when I do cry to thee;

   Upon me also mercy have,

   and do thou answer me.


   ^8When thou didst say, Seek ye my face,

   then unto thee reply

   Thus did my heart, Above all things

   thy face, Lord, seek will I.


   ^9Far from me hide not thou thy face;

   put not away from thee

   Thy servant in thy wrath: thou hast

   an helper been to me.


   O God of my salvation,

   leave me not, nor forsake:

   ^10Though me my parents both should leave,

   the Lord will me up take.


   ^11O Lord, instruct me in thy way,

   to me a leader be

   In a plain path, because of those

   that hatred bear to me.


   ^12Give me not to mine en'mies' will;

   for witnesses that lie

   Against me risen are, and such

   as breathe out cruelty.


   ^13I fainted had, unless that I

   believed had to see

   The Lord's own goodness in the land

   of them that living be.


   ^14Wait on the Lord, and be thou strong,

   and he shall strength afford

   Unto thine heart; yea, do thou wait,

   I say, upon the Lord.

Psalm 28

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1To thee I'll cry, O Lord, my rock;

   hold not thy peace to me;

   Lest like those that to pit descend

   I by thy silence be.


   ^2The voice hear of my humble pray'rs,

   when unto thee I cry;

   When to thine holy oracle

   I lift mine hands on high.


   ^3With ill men draw me not away

   that work iniquity;

   That speak peace to their friends, while in

   their hearts doth mischief lie.


   ^4Give them according to their deeds

   and ills endeavoured:

   And as their handy-works deserve,

   to them be rendered.


   ^5God shall not build, but them destroy,

   who would not understand

   The Lord's own works, nor did regard

   the doing of his hand.


   ^6For ever blessed be the Lord,

   for graciously he heard

   The voice of my petitions,

   and prayers did regard.


   ^7The Lord's my strength and shield; my heart

   upon him did rely;

   And I am helped: hence my heart

   doth joy exceedingly,


   And with my song I will him praise.

   ^8Their strength is God alone:

   He also is the saving strength

   of his anointed one.


   ^9O thine own people do thou save,

   bless thine inheritance;

   Them also do thou feed, and them

   for evermore advance.

Psalm 29

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Give ye unto the Lord, ye sons

   that of the mighty be,

   All strength and glory to the Lord

   with cheerfulness give ye.


   ^2Unto the Lord the glory give

   that to his name is due;

   And in the beauty of holiness

   unto Jehovah bow.


   ^3The Lord's voice on the waters is;

   the God of majesty

   Doth thunder, and on multitudes

   of waters sitteth he.


   ^4A pow'rful voice it is that comes

   out from the Lord most high;

   The voice of that great Lord is full

   of glorious majesty.


   ^5The voice of the Eternal doth

   asunder cedars tear;

   Yea, God the Lord doth cedars break

   that Lebanon doth bear.


   ^6He makes them like a calf to skip,

   ev'n that great Lebanon,

   And, like to a young unicorn,

   the mountain Sirion.


   ^7God's voice divides the flames of fire;

   ^8The desert it doth shake:

   The Lord doth make the wilderness

   of Kadesh all to quake.


   ^9God's voice doth make the hinds to calve,

   it makes the forest bare:

   And in his temple ev'ry one

   his glory doth declare.


   ^10The Lord sits on the floods; the Lord

   sits King, and ever shall.

   ^11The Lord will give his people strength,

   and with peace bless them all.

Psalm 30

   A Psalm and Song at the dedication of the house of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, I will thee extol, for thou

   hast lifted me on high,

   And over me thou to rejoice

   mad'st not mine enemy.


   ^2O thou who art the Lord my God,

   I in distress to thee,

   With loud cries lifted up my voice,

   and thou hast healed me.


   ^3O Lord, my soul thou hast brought up,

   and rescu'd from the grave;

   That I to pit should not go down,

   alive thou didst me save.


   ^4O ye that are his holy ones,

   sing praise unto the Lord;

   And give unto him thanks, when ye

   his holiness record.


   ^5For but a moment lasts his wrath;

   life in his favour lies:

   Weeping may for a night endure,

   at morn doth joy arise.


   ^6In my prosperity I said,

   that nothing shall me move.

   ^7O Lord, thou hast my mountain made

   to stand strong by thy love:


   But when that thou, O gracious God,

   didst hide thy face from me,

   Then quickly was my prosp'rous state

   turn'd into misery.


   ^8Wherefore unto the Lord my cry

   I caused to ascend:

   My humble supplication

   I to the Lord did send.


   ^9What profit is there in my blood,

   when I go down to pit?

   Shall unto thee the dust give praise?

   thy truth declare shall it?


   ^10Hear, Lord, have mercy; help me, Lord:

   ^11Thou turned hast my sadness

   To dancing; yea, my sackcloth loos'd,

   and girded me with gladness;


   ^12That sing thy praise my glory may,

   and never silent be.

   O Lord my God, for evermore

   I will give thanks to thee.

Psalm 31

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1In thee, O Lord, I put my trust,

   sham'd let me never be;

   According to thy righteousness

   do thou deliver me.


   ^2Bow down thine ear to me, with speed

   send me deliverance:

   To save me, my strong rock be thou,

   and my house of defence.


   ^3Because thou art my rock, and thee

   I for my fortress take;

   Therefore do thou me lead and guide,

   ev'n for thine own name's sake.


   ^4And sith thou art my strength, therefore

   pull me out of the net,

   Which they in subtilty for me

   so privily have set.


   ^5Into thine hands I do commit

   my sp'rit: for thou art he,

   O thou, Jehovah, God of truth,

   that hast redeemed me.


   ^6Those that do lying vanities

   regard, I have abhorr'd:

   But as for me, my confidence

   is fixed on the Lord.


   ^7I'll in thy mercy gladly joy:

   for thou my miseries

   Consider'd hast; thou hast my soul

   known in adversities:


   ^8And thou hast not inclosed me

   within the en'my's hand;

   And by thee have my feet been made

   in a large room to stand.


   ^9O Lord, upon me mercy have,

   for trouble is on me:

   Mine eye, my belly, and my soul,

   with grief consumed be.


   ^10Because my life with grief is spent,

   my years with sighs and groans:

   My strength doth fail; and for my sin

   consumed are my bones.


   ^11I was a scorn to all my foes,

   and to my friends a fear;

   And specially reproach'd of those

   that were my neighbours near:


   When they me saw they from me fled.

   ^12Ev'n so I am forgot,

   As men are out of mind when dead:

   I'm like a broken pot.


   ^13For slanders I of many heard;

   fear compass'd me, while they

   Against me did consult, and plot

   to take my life away.


   ^14But as for me, O Lord, my trust

   upon thee I did lay;

   And I to thee, Thou art my God,

   did confidently say.


   ^15My times are wholly in thine hand:

   do thou deliver me

   From their hands that mine enemies

   and persecutors be.


   ^16Thy countenance to shine do thou

   upon thy servant make:

   Unto me give salvation,

   for thy great mercies' sake.


   ^17Let me not be asham'd, O Lord,

   for on thee call'd I have:

   Let wicked men be sham'd, let them

   be silent in the grave.


   ^18To silence put the lying lips,

   that grievous things do say,

   And hard reports, in pride and scorn,

   on righteous men do lay.


   ^19How great's the goodness thou for them

   that fear thee keep'st in store,

   And wrought'st for them that trust in thee

   the sons of men before!


   ^20In secret of thy presence thou

   shalt hide them from man's pride:

   From strife of tongues thou closely shalt,

   as in a tent, them hide.


   ^21All praise and thanks be to the Lord;

   for he hath magnify'd

   His wondrous love to me within

   a city fortify'd.


   ^22For from thine eyes cut off I am,

   I in my haste had said;

   My voice yet heard'st thou, when to thee

   with cries my moan I made.


   ^23O love the Lord, all ye his saints;

   because the Lord doth guard

   The faithful, and he plenteously

   proud doers doth reward.


   ^24Be of good courage, and he strength

   unto your heart shall send,

   All ye whose hope and confidence

   doth on the Lord depend.

Psalm 32

   A Psalm of David, Maschil.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O blessed is the man to whom

   is freely pardoned

   All the transgression he hath done,

   whose sin is covered.


   ^2Bless'd is the man to whom the Lord

   imputeth not his sin,

   And in whose sp'rit there is no guile,

   nor fraud is found therein.


   ^3When as I did refrain my speech,

   and silent was my tongue,

   My bones then waxed old, because

   I roared all day long.


   ^4For upon me both day and night

   thine hand did heavy lie,

   So that my moisture turned is

   in summer's drought thereby.


   ^5I thereupon have unto thee

   my sin acknowledged,

   And likewise mine iniquity

   I have not covered:


   I will confess unto the Lord

   my trespasses, said I;

   And of my sin thou freely didst

   forgive th' iniquity.


   ^6For this shall ev'ry godly one

   his prayer make to thee;

   In such a time he shall thee seek,

   as found thou mayest be.


   Surely, when floods of waters great

   do swell up to the brim,

   They shall not overwhelm his soul,

   nor once come near to him.


   ^7Thou art my hiding-place, thou shalt

   from trouble keep me free:

   Thou with songs of deliverance

   about shalt compass me.


   ^8I will instruct thee, and thee teach

   the way that thou shalt go;

   And, with mine eye upon thee set,

   I will direction show.


   ^9Then be not like the horse or mule,

   which do not understand;

   Whose mouth, lest they come near to thee,

   a bridle must command.


   ^10Unto the man that wicked is

   his sorrows shall abound;

   But him that trusteth in the Lord

   mercy shall compass round.


   ^11Ye righteous, in the Lord be glad,

   in him do ye rejoice:

   All ye that upright are in heart,

   for joy lift up your voice.
     __________________________________________________________________

Psalm 33

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Ye righteous, in the Lord rejoice;

   it comely is and right,

   That upright men, with thankful voice,

   should praise the Lord of might.


   ^2Praise God with harp, and unto him

   sing with the psaltery;

   Upon a ten-string'd instrument

   make ye sweet melody.


   ^3A new song to him sing, and play

   with loud noise skilfully;

   ^4For right is God's word, all his works

   are done in verity.


   ^5To judgment and to righteousness

   a love he beareth still;

   The loving-kindness of the Lord

   the earth throughout doth fill.


   ^6The heavens by the word of God

   did their beginning take;

   And by the breathing of his mouth

   he all their hosts did make.


   ^7The waters of the seas he brings

   together as an heap;

   And in storehouses, as it were,

   he layeth up the deep.


   ^8Let earth, and all that live therein,

   with rev'rence fear the Lord;

   Let all the world's inhabitants

   dread him with one accord.


   ^9For he did speak the word, and done

   it was without delay;

   Established it firmly stood,

   whatever he did say.


   ^10God doth the counsel bring to nought

   which heathen folk do take;

   And what the people do devise

   of none effect doth make.


   ^11O but the counsel of the Lord

   doth stand for ever sure;

   And of his heart the purposes

   from age to age endure.


   ^12That nation blessed is, whose God

   Jehovah is, and those

   A blessed people are, whom for

   his heritage he chose.


   ^13The Lord from heav'n sees and beholds

   all sons of men full well:

   ^14He views all from his dwelling-place

   that in the earth do dwell.


   ^15He forms their hearts alike, and all

   their doings he observes.

   ^16Great hosts save not a king, much strength

   no mighty man preserves.


   ^17An horse for preservation

   is a deceitful thing;

   And by the greatness of his strength

   can no deliv'rance bring.


   ^18Behold on those that do him fear

   the Lord doth set his eye;

   Ev'n those who on his mercy do

   with confidence rely.


   ^19From death to free their soul, in dearth

   life unto them to yield.

   ^20Our soul doth wait upon the Lord;

   he is our help and shield.


   ^21Sith in his holy name we trust,

   our heart shall joyful be.

   ^22Lord, let thy mercy be on us,

   as we do hope in thee.

Psalm 34

   A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who
   drove him away, and he departed.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1God will I bless all times; his praise

   my mouth shall still express.

   ^2My soul shall boast in God: the meek

   shall hear with joyfulness.


   ^3Extol the Lord with me, let us

   exalt his name together.

   ^4I sought the Lord, he heard, and did

   me from all fears deliver.


   ^5They look'd to him, and lighten'd were:

   not shamed were their faces.

   ^6This poor man cry'd, God heard, and sav'd

   him from all his distresses.


   ^7The angel of the Lord encamps,

   and round encompasseth

   All those about that do him fear,

   and them delivereth.


   ^8O taste and see that God is good:

   who trusts in him is bless'd.

   ^9Fear God his saints: none that him fear

   shall be with want oppress'd.


   ^10The lions young may hungry be,

   and they may lack their food:

   But they that truly seek the Lord

   shall not lack any good.


   ^11O children, hither do ye come,

   and unto me give ear;

   I shall you teach to understand

   how ye the Lord should fear.


   ^12What man is he that life desires,

   to see good would live long?

   ^13Thy lips refrain from speaking guile,

   and from ill words thy tongue.


   ^14Depart from ill, do good, seek peace,

   pursue it earnestly.

   ^15God's eyes are on the just; his ears

   are open to their cry.


   ^16The face of God is set against

   those that do wickedly,

   That he may quite out from the earth

   cut off their memory.


   ^17The righteous cry unto the Lord,

   he unto them gives ear;

   And they out of their troubles all

   by him deliver'd are.


   ^18The Lord is ever nigh to them

   that be of broken sp'rit;

   To them he safety doth afford

   that are in heart contrite.


   ^19The troubles that afflict the just

   in number many be;

   But yet at length out of them all

   the Lord doth set him free.


   ^20He carefully his bones doth keep,

   whatever can befall;

   That not so much as one of them

   can broken be at all.


   ^21Ill shall the wicked slay; laid waste

   shall be who hate the just.

   ^22The Lord redeems his servants' souls;

   none perish that him trust.

Psalm 35

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Plead, Lord, with those that plead; and fight

   with those that fight with me.

   ^2Of shield and buckler take thou hold,

   stand up mine help to be.


   ^3Draw also out the spear, and do

   against them stop the way

   That me pursue: unto my soul,

   I'm thy salvation, say.


   ^4Let them confounded be and sham'd

   that for my soul have sought:

   Who plot my hurt turn'd back be they,

   and to confusion brought.


   ^5Let them be like unto the chaff

   that flies before the wind;

   And let the angel of the Lord

   pursue them hard behind.


   ^6With darkness cover thou their way,

   and let it slipp'ry prove;

   And let the angel of the Lord

   pursue them from above.


   ^7For without cause have they for me

   their net hid in a pit,

   They also have without a cause

   for my soul digged it.


   ^8Let ruin seize him unawares;

   his net he hid withal

   Himself let catch; and in the same

   destruction let him fall.


   ^9My soul in God shall joy; and glad

   in his salvation be:

   ^10And all my bones shall say, O Lord,

   who is like unto thee,


   Which dost the poor set free from him

   that is for him too strong;

   The poor and needy from the man

   that spoils and does him wrong?


   ^11False witnesses rose; to my charge

   things I not knew they laid.

   ^12They, to the spoiling of my soul,

   me ill for good repaid.


   ^13But as for me, when they were sick,

   in sackcloth sad I mourn'd:

   My humbled soul did fast, my pray'r

   into my bosom turn'd.


   ^14Myself I did behave as he

   had been my friend or brother;

   I heavily bow'd down, as one

   that mourneth for his mother.


   ^15But in my trouble they rejoic'd,

   gath'ring themselves together;

   Yea, abjects vile together did

   themselves against me gather:


   I knew it not; they did me tear,

   and quiet would not be.

   ^16With mocking hypocrites, at feasts

   they gnash'd their teeth at me.


   ^17How long, Lord, look'st thou on? from those

   destructions they intend

   Rescue my soul, from lions young

   my darling do defend.


   ^18I will give thanks to thee, O Lord,

   within th' assembly great;

   And where much people gather'd are

   thy praises forth will set.


   ^19Let not my wrongful enemies

   proudly rejoice o'er me;

   Nor who me hate without a cause,

   let them wink with the eye.


   ^20For peace they do not speak at all;

   but crafty plots prepare

   Against all those within the land

   that meek and quiet are.


   ^21With mouths set wide, they gainst me said,

   Ha, ha! our eye doth see.

   ^22Lord, thou hast seen, hold not thy peace;

   Lord, be not far from me.


   ^23Stir up thyself; wake, that thou may'st

   judgment to me afford,

   Ev'n to my cause, O thou that art

   my only God and Lord.


   ^24O Lord my God, do thou me judge

   after thy righteousness;

   And let them not their joy gainst me

   triumphantly express:


   ^25Nor let them say within their hearts,

   Ah, we would have it thus;

   Nor suffer them to say, that he

   is swallow'd up by us.


   ^26Sham'd and confounded be they all

   that at my hurt are glad;

   Let those against me that do boast

   with shame and scorn be clad.


   ^27Let them that love my righteous cause

   be glad, shout, and not cease

   To say, The Lord be magnify'd,

   who loves his servant's peace.


   ^28Thy righteousness shall also be

   declared by my tongue;

   The praises that belong to thee

   speak shall it all day long.

Psalm 36

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1The wicked man's transgression

   within my heart thus says,

   Undoubtedly the fear of God

   is not before his eyes.


   ^2Because himself he flattereth

   in his own blinded eye,

   Until the hatefulness be found

   of his iniquity.


   ^3Words from his mouth proceeding are,

   fraud and iniquity:

   He to be wise, and to do good,

   hath left off utterly.


   ^4He mischief, lying on his bed,

   most cunningly doth plot:

   He sets himself in ways not good,

   ill he abhorreth not.


   ^5Thy mercy, Lord, is in the heav'ns;

   thy truth doth reach the clouds:

   ^6Thy justice is like mountains great;

   thy judgments deep as floods:


   Lord, thou preservest man and beast.

   ^7How precious is thy grace!

   Therefore in shadow of thy wings

   men's sons their trust shall place.


   ^8They with the fatness of thy house

   shall be well satisfy'd;

   From rivers of thy pleasures thou

   wilt drink to them provide.


   ^9Because of life the fountain pure

   remains alone with thee;

   And in that purest light of thine

   we clearly light shall see.


   ^10Thy loving-kindness unto them

   continue that thee know;

   And still on men upright in heart

   thy righteousness bestow.


   ^11Let not the foot of cruel pride

   come, and against me stand;

   And let me not removed be,

   Lord, by the wicked's hand.


   ^12There fallen are they, and ruined,

   that work iniquities:

   Cast down they are, and never shall

   be able to arise.

   ^2For, even like unto the grass,

   soon be cut down shall they;

   And, like the green and tender herb,

   they wither shall away.


   ^3Set thou thy trust upon the Lord,

   and be thou doing good;

   like noon-tide of the day.


   ^7Rest in the Lord, and patiently

   wait for him: do not fret

   For him who, prosp'ring in his way,

   success in sin doth get.


   ^8Do thou from anger cease, and wrath

   see thou forsake also:

   Fret not thyself in any wise,

   that evil thou should'st do.


   ^9For those that evil doers are

   shall be cut off and fall:

   But those that wait upon the Lord

   the earth inherit shall.


   ^10For yet a little while, and then

   the wicked shall not be;

   His place thou shalt consider well,

   but it thou shalt not see.


   ^11But by inheritance the earth

   the meek ones shall possess:

   They also shall delight themselves

   in an abundant peace.


   ^12The wicked plots against the just,

   and at him whets his teeth:

   ^13The Lord shall laugh at him, because

   his day he coming seeth.


   ^14The wicked have drawn out the sword,

   and bent their bow, to slay

   The poor and needy, and to kill

   men of an upright way.


   ^15But their own sword, which they have drawn,

   shall enter their own heart:

   Their bows which they have bent shall break,

   and into pieces part.


   ^16A little that a just man hath

   is more and better far

   Than is the wealth of many such

   as lewd and wicked are.


   ^17For sinners' arms shall broken be;

   but God the just sustains.

   ^18God knows the just man's days, and still

   their heritage remains.


   ^19They shall not be asham'd when they

   the evil time do see;

   And when the days of famine are,

   they satisfy'd shall be.


   ^20But wicked men, and foes of God,

   as fat of lambs, decay;

   They shall consume, yea, into smoke

   they shall consume away.


   ^21The wicked borrows, but the same

   again he doth not pay;

   Whereas the righteous mercy shews,

   and gives his own away.


   ^22For such as blessed be of him

   the earth inherit shall;

   And they that cursed are of him

   shall be destroyed all.


   ^23A good man's footsteps by the Lord

   are ordered aright;

   And in the way wherein he walks

   he greatly doth delight.


   ^24Although he fall, yet shall he not

   be cast down utterly;

   Because the Lord with his own hand

   upholds him mightily.


   ^25I have been young, and now am old,

   yet have I never seen

   The just man left, nor that his seed

   for bread have beggars been.


   ^26He's ever merciful, and lends:

   his seed is bless'd therefore.

   ^27Depart from evil, and do good,

   and dwell for evermore.


   ^28For God loves judgment, and his saints

   leaves not in any case;

   They are kept ever: but cut off

   shall be the sinner's race.


   ^29The just inherit shall the land,

   and ever in it dwell:

   ^30The just man's mouth doth wisdom speak;

   his tongue doth judgment tell.


   ^31In's heart the law is of his God,

   his steps slide not away.

   ^32The wicked man doth watch the just,

   and seeketh him to slay.


   ^33Yet him the Lord will not forsake,

   nor leave him in his hands:

   The righteous will he not condemn,

   when he in judgment stands.


   ^34Wait on the Lord, and keep his way,

   and thee exalt shall he

   Th' earth to inherit; when cut off

   the wicked thou shalt see.


   ^35I saw the wicked great in pow'r,

   spread like a green bay-tree:

   ^36He pass'd, yea, was not; him I sought,

   but found he could not be.


   ^37Mark thou the perfect, and behold

   the man of uprightness;

   Because that surely of this man

   the latter end is peace.


   ^38But those men that transgressors are

   shall be destroy'd together;

   The latter end of wicked men

   shall be cut off for ever.


   ^39But the salvation of the just

   is from the Lord above;

   He in the time of their distress

   their stay and strength doth prove.


   ^40The Lord shall help, and them deliver:

   he shall them free and save

   From wicked men; because in him

   their confidence they have.

Psalm 38

   A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1In thy great indignation,

   O Lord, rebuke me not;

   Nor on me lay thy chast'ning hand,

   in thy displeasure hot.


   ^2For in me fast thine arrows stick,

   thine hand doth press me sore:

   ^3And in my flesh there is no health,

   nor soundness any more.


   This grief I have, because thy wrath

   is forth against me gone;

   And in my bones there is no rest,

   for sin that I have done.


   ^4Because gone up above mine head

   my great transgressions be;

   And, as a weighty burden, they

   too heavy are for me.


   ^5My wounds do stink, and are corrupt;

   my folly makes it so.

   ^6I troubled am, and much bow'd down;

   all day I mourning go.


   ^7For a disease that loathsome is

   so fills my loins with pain,

   That in my weak and weary flesh

   no soundness doth remain.


   ^8So feeble and infirm am I,

   and broken am so sore,

   That, through disquiet of my heart,

   I have been made to roar.


   ^9O Lord, all that I do desire

   is still before thine eye;

   And of my heart the secret groans

   not hidden are from thee.


   ^10My heart doth pant incessantly,

   my strength doth quite decay;

   As for mine eyes, their wonted light

   is from me gone away.


   ^11My lovers and my friends do stand

   at distance from my sore;

   And those do stand aloof that were

   kinsmen and kind before.


   ^12Yea, they that seek my life lay snares:

   who seek to do me wrong

   Speak things mischievous, and deceits

   imagine all day long.


   ^13But, as one deaf, that heareth not,

   I suffer'd all to pass;

   I as a dumb man did become,

   whose mouth not open'd was:


   ^14As one that hears not, in whose mouth

   are no reproofs at all.

   ^15For, Lord, I hope in thee; my God,

   thou'lt hear me when I call.


   ^16For I said, Hear me, lest they should

   rejoice o'er me with pride;

   And o'er me magnify themselves,

   when as my foot doth slide.


   ^17For I am near to halt, my grief

   is still before mine eye:

   ^18For I'll declare my sin, and grieve

   for mine iniquity.


   ^19But yet mine en'mies lively are,

   and strong are they beside;

   And they that hate me wrongfully

   are greatly multiply'd.


   ^20And they for good that render ill,

   as en'mies me withstood;

   Yea, ev'n for this, because that I

   do follow what is good.


   ^21Forsake me not, O Lord; my God,

   far from me never be.

   ^22O Lord, thou my salvation art,

   haste to give help to me.

Psalm 39

   To the chief Musician, even to Jeduthan, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1I said, I will look to my ways,

   lest with my tongue I sin:

   In sight of wicked men my mouth

   with bridle I'll keep in.


   ^2With silence I as dumb became,

   I did myself restrain

   From speaking good; but then the more

   increased was my pain.


   ^3My heart within me waxed hot;

   and, while I musing was,

   The fire did burn; and from my tongue

   these words I did let pass:


   ^4Mine end, and measure of my days,

   O Lord, unto me show

   What is the same; that I thereby

   my frailty well may know.


   ^5Lo, thou my days an handbreadth mad'st;

   mine age is in thine eye

   As nothing: sure each man at best

   is wholly vanity.


   ^6Sure each man walks in a vain show;

   they vex themselves in vain:

   He heaps up wealth, and doth not know

   to whom it shall pertain.


   ^7And now, O Lord, what wait I for?

   my hope is fix'd on thee.

   ^8Free me from all my trespasses,

   the fool's scorn make not me.


   ^9Dumb was I, op'ning not my mouth,

   because this work was thine.

   ^10Thy stroke take from me; by the blow

   of thine hand I do pine.


   ^11When with rebukes thou dost correct

   man for iniquity,

   Thou wastes his beauty like a moth:

   sure each man's vanity.


   ^12Attend my cry, Lord, at my tears

   and pray'rs not silent be:

   I sojourn as my fathers all,

   and stranger am with thee.


   ^13O spare thou me, that I my strength

   recover may again,

   Before from hence I do depart,

   and here no more remain.

Psalm 40

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1I waited for the Lord my God,

   and patiently did bear;

   At length to me he did incline

   my voice and cry to hear.


   ^2He took me from a fearful pit,

   and from the miry clay,

   And on a rock he set my feet,

   establishing my way.


   ^3He put a new song in my mouth,

   our God to magnify:

   Many shall see it, and shall fear,

   and on the Lord rely.


   ^4O blessed is the man whose trust

   upon the Lord relies;

   Respecting not the proud, nor such

   as turn aside to lies.


   ^5O Lord my God, full many are

   the wonders thou hast done;

   Thy gracious thoughts to us-ward far

   above all thoughts are gone:


   In order none can reckon them

   to thee: if them declare,

   And speak of them I would, they more

   than can be number'd are.


   ^6No sacrifice nor offering

   didst thou at all desire;

   Mine ears thou bor'd: sin-off ring thou

   and burnt didst not require:


   ^7Then to the Lord these were my words,

   I come, behold and see;

   Within the volume of the book

   it written is of me:


   ^8To do thy will I take delight,

   O thou my God that art;

   Yea, that most holy law of thine

   I have within my heart.


   ^9Within the congregation great

   I righteousness did preach:

   Lo, thou dost know, O Lord, that I

   refrained not my speech.


   ^10I never did within my heart

   conceal thy righteousness;

   I thy salvation have declar'd,

   and shown thy faithfulness:


   Thy kindness, which most loving is,

   concealed have not I,

   Nor from the congregation great

   have hid thy verity.


   ^11Thy tender mercies, Lord, from me

   O do thou not restrain;

   Thy loving-kindness, and thy truth,

   let them me still maintain.


   ^12For ills past reck'ning compass me,

   and mine iniquities

   Such hold upon me taken have,

   I cannot lift mine eyes:


   They more than hairs are on mine head,

   thence is my heart dismay'd.

   ^13Be pleased, Lord, to rescue me;

   Lord, hasten to mine aid.


   ^14Sham'd and confounded be they all

   that seek my soul to kill;

   Yea, let them backward driven be,

   and sham'd, that wish me ill.


   ^15For a reward of this their shame

   confounded let them be.

   That in this manner scoffing say,

   Aha, aha! to me.


   ^16In thee let all be glad, and joy,

   who seeking thee abide;

   Who thy salvation love, say still,

   The Lord be magnify'd.


   ^17I'm poor and needy, yet the Lord

   of me a care doth take:

   Thou art my help and saviour,

   my God, no tarrying make.

Psalm 41

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Blessed is he that wisely doth

   the poor man's case consider;

   For when the time of trouble is,

   the Lord will him deliver.


   ^2God will him keep, yea, save alive;

   on earth he bless'd shall live;

   And to his enemies' desire

   thou wilt him not up give.


   ^3God will give strength when he on bed

   of languishing doth mourn;

   And in his sickness sore, O Lord,

   thou all his bed wilt turn.


   ^4I said, O Lord, do thou extend

   thy mercy unto me;

   O do thou heal my soul; for why?

   I have offended thee.


   ^5Those that to me are enemies,

   of me do evil say,

   When shall he die, that so his name

   may perish quite away?


   ^6To see me if he comes, he speaks

   vain words: but then his heart

   Heaps mischief to it, which he tells,

   when forth he doth depart.


   ^7My haters jointly whispering,

   'gainst me my hurt devise.

   ^8Mischief, say they, cleaves fast to him;

   he li'th, and shall not rise.


   ^9Yea, ev'n mine own familiar friend,

   on whom I did rely,

   Who ate my bread, ev'n he his heel

   against me lifted high.


   ^10But, Lord, be merciful to me,

   and up again me raise,

   That I may justly them requite

   according to their ways.


   ^11By this I know that certainly

   I favour'd am by thee;

   Because my hateful enemy

   triumphs not over me.


   ^12But as for me, thou me uphold'st

   in mine integrity;

   And me before thy countenance

   thou sett'st continually.


   ^13The Lord, the God of Israel,

   be bless'd for ever then,

   From age to age eternally.

   Amen, yea, and amen.

Psalm 42

   To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Like as the hart for water-brooks

   in thirst doth pant and bray;

   So pants my longing soul, O God,

   that come to thee I may.


   ^2My soul for God, the living God,

   doth thirst: when shall I near

   Unto thy countenance approach,

   and in God's sight appear?


   ^3My tears have unto me been meat,

   both in the night and day,

   While unto me continually,

   Where is thy God? they say.


   ^4My soul is poured out in me,

   when this I think upon;

   Because that with the multitude

   I heretofore had gone:


   With them into God's house I went,

   with voice of joy and praise;

   Yea, with the multitude that kept

   the solemn holy days.


   ^5O why art thou cast down, my soul?

   why in me so dismay'd?

   Trust God, for I shall praise him yet,

   his count'nance is mine aid.


   ^6My God, my soul's cast down in me;

   thee therefore mind I will

   From Jordan's land, the Hermonites,

   and ev'n from Mizar hill.


   ^7At the noise of thy water-spouts

   deep unto deep doth call;

   Thy breaking waves pass over me,

   yea, and thy billows all.


   ^8His loving-kindness yet the Lord

   command will in the day,

   His song's with me by night; to God,

   by whom I live, I'll pray:


   ^9And I will say to God my rock,

   Why me forgett'st thou so?

   Why, for my foes' oppression,

   thus mourning do I go?


   ^10'Tis as a sword within my bones,

   when my foes me upbraid;

   Ev'n when by them, Where is thy God?

   'tis daily to me said.


   ^11O why art thou cast down, my soul?

   why, thus with grief opprest,

   Art thou disquieted in me?

   in God still hope and rest:


   For yet I know I shall him praise,

   who graciously to me

   The health is of my countenance,

   yea, mine own God is he.

Psalm 43

   ^1Judge me, O God, and plead my cause

   From the unjust and crafty man,

   O be thou my salvation.


   ^2For thou the God art of my strength;

   why thrusts thou me thee fro'?

   For th' enemy's oppression

   why do I mourning go?


   ^3O send thy light forth and thy truth;

   let them be guides to me,

   And bring me to thine holy hill,

   ev'n where thy dwellings be.


   ^4Then will I to God's altar go,

   to God my chiefest joy:

   Yea, God, my God, thy name to praise

   my harp I will employ.


   ^5Why art thou then cast down, my soul?

   what should discourage thee?

   And why with vexing thoughts art thou

   disquieted in me?


   Still trust in God; for him to praise

   good cause I yet shall have:

   He of my count'nance is the health,

   my God that doth me save.

Psalm 44

   To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O God, we with our ears have heard,

   our fathers have us told,

   What works thou in their days hadst done,

   ev'n in the days of old.


   ^2Thy hand did drive the heathen out,

   and plant them in their place;

   Thou didst afflict the nations,

   but them thou didst increase.


   ^3For neither got their sword the land,

   nor did their arm them save;

   But thy right hand, arm, countenance;

   for thou them favour gave.


   ^4Thou art my King: for Jacob, Lord,

   deliv'rances command.

   ^5Through thee we shall push down our foes,

   that do against us stand:


   We, through thy name, shall tread down those

   that ris'n against us have.

   ^6For in my bow I shall not trust,

   nor shall my sword me save.


   ^7But from our foes thou hast us sav'd,

   our haters put to shame.

   ^8In God we all the day do boast,

   and ever praise thy name.


   ^9But now we are cast off by thee,

   and us thou putt'st to shame;

   And when our armies do go forth,

   thou go'st not with the same.


   ^10Thou mak'st us from the enemy,

   faint-hearted, to turn back;

   And they who hate us for themselves

   our spoils away do take.


   ^11Like sheep for meat thou gavest us;

   'mong heathen cast we be.

   ^12Thou didst for nought thy people sell;

   their price enrich'd not thee.


   ^13Thou mak'st us a reproach to be

   unto our neighbours near;

   Derision and a scorn to them

   that round about us are.


   ^14A by-word also thou dost us

   among the heathen make;

   The people, in contempt and spite,

   at us their heads do shake.


   ^15Before me my confusion

   continually abides;

   And of my bashful countenance

   the shame me ever hides:


   ^16For voice of him that doth reproach,

   and speaketh blasphemy;

   By reason of th' avenging foe,

   and cruel enemy.


   ^17All this is come on us, yet we

   have not forgotten thee;

   Nor falsely in thy covenant

   behav'd ourselves have we.


   ^18Back from thy way our heart not turn'd;

   our steps no straying made;

   ^19Though us thou brak'st in dragons' place,

   and cover'dst with death's shade.


   ^20If we God's name forgot, or stretch'd

   to a strange god our hands,

   ^21Shall not God search this out? for he

   heart's secrets understands.


   ^22Yea, for thy sake we're kill'd all day,

   counted as slaughter-sheep.

   ^23Rise, Lord, cast us not ever off;

   awake, why dost thou sleep?


   ^24O wherefore hidest thou thy face?

   forgett'st our cause distress'd,

   ^25And our oppression? For our soul

   is to the dust down press'd:


   Our belly also on the earth

   fast cleaving, hold doth take.

   ^26Rise for our help, and us redeem,

   ev'n for thy mercies' sake.

Psalm 45

   To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil,
   A Song of loves.

First Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1My heart brings forth a goodly thing;

   my words that I indite

   Concern the King: my tongue's a pen

   of one that swift doth write.


   ^2Thou fairer art than sons of men:

   into thy lips is store

   Of grace infus'd; God therefore thee

   hath bless'd for evermore.


   ^3O thou that art the mighty One,

   thy sword gird on thy thigh;

   Ev'n with thy glory excellent,

   and with thy majesty.


   ^4For meekness, truth, and righteousness,

   in state ride prosp'rously;

   And thy right hand shall thee instruct

   in things that fearful be.


   ^5Thine arrows sharply pierce the heart

   of th' en'mies of the King;

   And under thy subjection

   the people down do bring.


   ^6For ever and for ever is,

   O God, thy throne of might;

   The sceptre of thy kingdom is

   a sceptre that is right.


   ^7Thou lovest right, and hatest ill;

   for God, thy God, most high,

   Above thy fellows hath with th' oil

   of joy anointed thee.


   ^8Of aloes, myrrh, and cassia,

   a smell thy garments had,

   Out of the iv'ry palaces,

   whereby they made thee glad.


   ^9Among thy women honourable

   kings' daughters were at hand:

   Upon thy right hand did the queen

   in gold of Ophir stand.


   ^10O daughter, hearken and regard,

   and do thine ear incline;

   Likewise forget thy father's house,

   and people that are thine.


   ^11Then of the King desir'd shall be

   thy beauty veh'mently:

   Because he is thy Lord, do thou

   him worship rev'rently.


   ^12The daughter there of Tyre shall be

   with gifts and off rings great:

   Those of the people that are rich

   thy favour shall entreat.


   ^13Behold, the daughter of the King

   all glorious is within;

   And with embroideries of gold

   her garments wrought have been.


   ^14She shall be brought unto the King

   in robes with needle wrought;

   Her fellow-virgins following

   shall unto thee be brought.


   ^15They shall be brought with gladness great,

   and mirth on ev'ry side,

   Into the palace of the King,

   and there they shall abide.


   ^16Instead of those thy fathers dear,

   thy children thou may'st take,

   And in all places of the earth

   them noble princes make.


   ^17Thy name remember'd I will make

   through ages all to be:

   The people therefore evermore

   shall praises give to thee.

Second Version (S.M.)

   6,6,8,6


   ^1My heart inditing is

   good matter in a song:

   I speak the things that I have made,

   which to the King belong:


   My tongue shall be as quick,

   his honour to indite,

   As is the pen of any scribe

   that useth fast to write.


   ^2Thou'rt fairest of all men;

   grace in thy lips doth flow:

   And therefore blessings evermore

   on thee doth God bestow.


   ^3Thy sword gird on thy thigh,

   thou that art most of might:

   Appear in dreadful majesty,

   and in thy glory bright.


   ^4For meekness, truth, and right,

   ride prosp'rously in state;

   And thy right hand shall teach to thee

   things terrible and great.


   ^5Thy shafts shall pierce their hearts

   that foes are to the King;

   Whereby into subjection

   the people thou shalt bring.


   ^6Thy royal seat, O Lord,

   for ever shall remain:

   The sceptre of thy kingdom doth

   all righteousness maintain.


   ^7Thou lov'st right, and hat'st ill;

   for God, thy God, most high,

   Above thy fellows hath with th' oil

   of joy anointed thee.


   ^8Of myrrh and spices sweet

   a smell thy garments had,

   Out of the iv'ry palaces,

   whereby they made thee glad.


   ^9And in thy glorious train

   kings' daughters waiting stand;

   And thy fair queen, in Ophir gold,

   doth stand at thy right hand.


   ^10O daughter, take good heed,

   incline, and give good ear;

   Thou must forget thy kindred all,

   and father's house most dear.


   ^11Thy beauty to the King

   shall then delightful be:

   And do thou humbly worship him,

   because thy Lord is he.


   ^12The daughter then of Tyre

   there with a gift shall be,

   And all the wealthy of the land

   shall make their suit to thee.


   ^13The daughter of the King

   all glorious is within;

   And with embroideries of gold

   her garments wrought have been.


   ^14She cometh to the King

   in robes with needle wrought;

   The virgins that do follow her

   shall unto thee be brought.


   ^15They shall be brought with joy,

   and mirth on ev'ry side,

   Into the palace of the King,

   and there they shall abide.


   ^16And in thy fathers' stead,

   thy children thou may'st take,

   And in all places of the earth

   them noble princes make.


   ^17I will shew forth thy name

   to generations all:

   Therefore the people evermore

   to thee give praises shall.

   ^1God is our refuge and our strength,

   in straits a present aid;

   ^2Therefore, although the earth remove,

   we will not be afraid:


   Though hills amidst the seas be cast;

   ^3Though waters roaring make,

   And troubled be; yea, though the hills,

   by swelling seas do shake.


   ^4A river is, whose streams do glad

   the city of our God;

   The holy place, wherein the Lord

   most high hath his abode.


   ^5God in the midst of her doth dwell;

   nothing shall her remove:

   The Lord to her an helper will,

   and that right early, prove.


   ^6The heathen rag'd tumultuously,

   the kingdoms moved were:

   The Lord God uttered his voice,

   the earth did melt for fear.


   ^7The Lord of hosts upon our side

   doth constantly remain:

   The God of Jacob's our refuge,

   us safely to maintain.


   ^8Come, and behold what wondrous works

   have by the Lord been wrought;

   Come, see what desolations

   he on the earth hath brought.


   ^9Unto the ends of all the earth

   wars into peace he turns:

   The bow he breaks, the spear he cuts,

   in fire the chariot burns.


   ^10Be still, and know that I am God;

   among the heathen I

   Will be exalted; I on earth

   will be exalted high.


   ^11Our God, who is the Lord of hosts,

   is still upon our side;

   The God of Jacob our refuge

   for ever will abide.

Psalm 47

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1All people, clap your hands; to God

   with voice of triumph shout:

   ^2For dreadful is the Lord most high,

   great King the earth throughout.


   ^3The heathen people under us

   he surely shall subdue;

   And he shall make the nations

   under our feet to bow.


   ^4The lot of our inheritance

   chuse out for us shall he,

   Of Jacob, whom he loved well,

   ev'n the excellency.


   ^5God is with shouts gone up, the Lord

   with trumpets sounding high.

   ^6Sing praise to God, sing praise, sing praise,

   praise to our King sing ye.


   ^7For God is King of all the earth;

   with knowledge praise express.

   ^8God rules the nations: God sits on

   his throne of holiness.


   ^9The princes of the people are

   assembled willingly;

   Ev'n of the God of Abraham

   they who the people be.


   For why? the shields that do defend

   the earth are only his:

   They to the Lord belong; yea, he

   exalted greatly is.

Psalm 48

   A Song and Psalm for the sons of Korah.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Great is the Lord, and greatly he

   is to be praised still,

   Within the city of our God,

   upon his holy hill.


   ^2Mount Sion stands most beautiful,

   the joy of all the land;

   The city of the mighty King

   on her north side doth stand.


   ^3The Lord within her palaces

   is for a refuge known.

   ^4For, lo, the kings that gather'd were

   together, by have gone.


   ^5But when they did behold the same,

   they, wond'ring, would not stay;

   But, being troubled at the sight,

   they thence did haste away.


   ^6Great terror there took hold on them;

   they were possess'd with fear;

   Their grief came like a woman's pain,

   when she a child doth bear.


   ^7Thou Tarshish ships with east wind break'st:

   ^8As we have heard it told,

   So, in the city of the Lord,

   our eyes did it behold;


   In our God's city, which his hand

   for ever stablish will.

   ^9We of thy loving-kindness thought,

   Lord, in thy temple still.


   ^10O Lord, according to thy name,

   through all the earth's thy praise;

   And thy right hand, O Lord, is full

   of righteousness always.


   ^11Because thy judgments are made known,

   let Sion mount rejoice;

   Of Judah let the daughters all

   send forth a cheerful voice.


   ^12Walk about Sion, and go round;

   the high tow'rs thereof tell:

   ^13Consider ye her palaces,

   and mark her bulwarks well;


   That ye may tell posterity.

   ^14For this God doth abide

   Our God for evermore; he will

   ev'n unto death us guide.

Psalm 49

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Hear this, all people, and give ear,

   all in the world that dwell;

   ^2Both low and high, both rich and poor.

   ^3My mouth shall wisdom tell:


   My heart shall knowledge meditate.

   ^4I will incline mine ear

   To parables, and on the harp

   my sayings dark declare.


   ^5Amidst those days that evil be,

   why should I, fearing, doubt?

   When of my heels th' iniquity

   shall compass me about.


   ^6Whoe'er they be that in their wealth

   their confidence do pitch,

   And boast themselves, because they are

   become exceeding rich:


   ^7Yet none of these his brother can

   redeem by any way;

   Nor can he unto God for him

   sufficient ransom pay,


   ^8(Their soul's redemption precious is,

   and it can never be,)

   ^9That still he should for ever live,

   and not corruption see.


   ^10For why? he seeth that wise men die,

   and brutish fools also

   Do perish; and their wealth, when dead,

   to others they let go.


   ^11Their inward thought is, that their house

   and dwelling-places shall

   Stand through all ages; they their lands

   by their own names do call.


   ^12But yet in honour shall not man

   abide continually;

   But passing hence, may be compar'd

   unto the beasts that die.


   ^13Thus brutish folly plainly is

   their wisdom and their way;

   Yet their posterity approve

   what they do fondly say.


   ^14Like sheep they in the grave are laid,

   and death shall them devour;

   And in the morning upright men

   shall over them have pow'r:


   Their beauty from their dwelling shall

   consume within the grave.

   ^15But from hell's hand God will me free,

   for he shall me receive.


   ^16Be thou not then afraid when one

   enriched thou dost see,

   Nor when the glory of his house

   advanced is on high:


   ^17For he shall carry nothing hence

   when death his days doth end;

   Nor shall his glory after him

   into the grave descend.


   ^18Although he his own soul did bless

   whilst he on earth did live;

   (And when thou to thyself dost well,

   men will thee praises give;)


   ^19He to his fathers' race shall go,

   they never shall see light.

   ^20Man honour'd wanting knowledge is

   like beasts that perish quite.

Psalm 50

   A Psalm of Asaph.

First Version (S.M.)

   6,6,8,6


   ^1The mighty God, the Lord,

   hath spoken, and did call

   The earth, from rising of the sun,

   to where he hath his fall.


   ^2From out of Sion hill,

   which of excellency

   And beauty the perfection is,

   God shined gloriously.


   ^3Our God shall surely come,

   keep silence shall not he:

   Before him fire shall waste, great storms

   shall round about him be.


   ^4Unto the heavens clear

   he from above shall call,

   And to the earth likewise, that he

   may judge his people all.


   ^5Together let my saints

   unto me gather'd be,

   Those that by sacrifice have made

   a covenant with me.


   ^6And then the heavens shall

   his righteousness declare:

   Because the Lord himself is he

   by whom men judged are.


   ^7My people Isr'el hear,

   speak will I from on high,

   Against thee I will testify;

   God, ev'n thy God, am I.


   ^8I for thy sacrifice

   no blame will on thee lay,

   Nor for burnt-off rings, which to me

   thou offer'dst ev'ry day.


   ^9I'll take no calf nor goats

   from house or fold of thine:

   ^10For beasts of forests, cattle all

   on thousand hills, are mine.


   ^11The fowls on mountains high

   are all to me well known;

   Wild beasts which in the fields do lie,

   ev'n they are all mine own.


   ^12Then, if I hungry were,

   I would not tell it thee;

   Because the world, and fulness all

   thereof, belongs to me.


   ^13Will I eat flesh of bulls?

   or goats' blood drink will I?

   ^14Thanks offer thou to God, and pay

   thy vows to the most High.


   ^15And call upon me when

   in trouble thou shalt be;

   I will deliver thee, and thou

   my name shalt glorify.


   ^16But to the wicked man

   God saith, My laws and truth

   Should'st thou declare? how dar'st thou take

   my cov'nant in thy mouth?


   ^17Sith thou instruction hat'st,

   which should thy ways direct;

   And sith my words behind thy back

   thou cast'st, and dost reject.


   ^18When thou a thief didst see,

   with him thou didst consent;

   And with the vile adulterers

   partaker on thou went.


   ^19Thou giv'st thy mouth to ill,

   thy tongue deceit doth frame;

   ^20Thou sitt'st, and gainst thy brother speak'st,

   thy mother's son dost shame.


   ^21Because I silence kept,

   while thou these things hast wrought;

   That I was altogether like

   thyself, hath been thy thought;


   Yet I will thee reprove,

   and set before thine eyes,

   In order ranked, thy misdeeds

   and thine iniquities.


   ^22Now, ye that God forget,

   this carefully consider;

   Lest I in pieces tear you all,

   and none can you deliver.


   ^23Whoso doth offer praise

   me glorifies; and I

   Will shew him God's salvation,

   that orders right his way.

Psalm 50

Second Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1The mighty God, the Lord, hath spoke,

   and call'd the earth upon,

   Ev'n from the rising of the sun

   unto his going down.


   ^2From out of Sion, his own hill,

   where the perfection high

   Of beauty is, from thence the Lord

   hath shined gloriously.


   ^3Our God shall come, and shall no more

   be silent, but speak out:

   Before him fire shall waste, great storms

   shall compass him about.


   ^4He to the heavens from above,

   and to the earth below,

   Shall call, that he his judgments may

   before his people show.


   ^5Let all my saints together be

   unto me gathered;

   Those that by sacrifice with me

   a covenant have made.


   ^6And then the heavens shall declare

   his righteousness abroad:

   Because the Lord himself doth come;

   none else is judge but God.


   ^7Hear, O my people, and I'll speak;

   O Israel by name,

   Against thee I will testify;

   God, ev'n thy God, I am.


   ^8I for thy sacrifices few

   reprove thee never will,

   Nor for burnt-off rings to have been

   before me offer'd still.


   ^9I'll take no bullock nor he-goats

   from house nor folds of thine:

   ^10For beasts of forests, cattle all

   on thousand hills, are mine.


   ^11The fowls are all to me well known

   that mountains high do yield;

   And I do challenge as mine own

   the wild beasts of the field.


   ^12If I were hungry, I would not

   to thee for need complain;

   For earth, and all its fulness, doth

   to me of right pertain.


   ^13That I to eat the flesh of bulls

   take pleasure dost thou think?

   Or that I need, to quench my thirst,

   the blood of goats to drink?


   ^14Nay, rather unto me, thy God,

   thanksgiving offer thou:

   To the most High perform thy word,

   and fully pay thy vow:


   ^15And in the day of trouble great

   see that thou call on me;

   I will deliver thee, and thou

   my name shalt glorify.


   ^16But God unto the wicked saith,

   Why should'st thou mention make

   Of my commands? how dar'st thou in

   thy mouth my cov'nant take?


   ^17Sith it is so that thou dost hate

   all good instruction;

   And sith thou cast'st behind thy back,

   and slight'st my words each one.


   ^18When thou a thief didst see, then straight

   thou join'dst with him in sin,

   And with the vile adulterers

   thou hast partaker been.


   ^19Thy mouth to evil thou dost give,

   thy tongue deceit doth frame.

   ^20Thou sitt'st, and gainst thy brother speak'st,

   thy mother's son to shame.


   ^21These things thou wickedly hast done,

   and I have silent been:

   Thou thought'st that I was like thyself,

   and did approve thy sin:


   But I will sharply thee reprove,

   and I will order right

   Thy sins and thy transgressions

   in presence of thy sight.


   ^22Consider this, and be afraid,

   ye that forget the Lord,

   Lest I in pieces tear you all,

   when none can help afford.


   ^23Who off'reth praise me glorifies:

   I will shew God's salvation

   To him that ordereth aright

   his life and conversation.

Psalm 51

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came
   unto him, after he had gone into Bathsheba.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1After thy loving-kindness, Lord,

   have mercy upon me:

   For thy compassions great, blot out

   all mine iniquity.


   ^2Me cleanse from sin, and throughly wash

   from mine iniquity:

   ^3For my transgressions I confess;

   my sin I ever see.


   ^4'Gainst thee, thee only, have I sinn'd,

   in thy sight done this ill;

   That when thou speak'st thou may'st be just,

   and clear in judging still.


   ^5Behold, I in iniquity

   was form'd the womb within;

   My mother also me conceiv'd

   in guiltiness and sin.


   ^6Behold, thou in the inward parts

   with truth delighted art;

   And wisdom thou shalt make me know

   within the hidden part.


   ^7Do thou with hyssop sprinkle me,

   I shall be cleansed so;

   Yea, wash thou me, and then I shall

   be whiter than the snow.


   ^8Of gladness and of joyfulness

   make me to hear the voice;

   That so these very bones which thou

   hast broken may rejoice.


   ^9All mine iniquities blot out,

   thy face hide from my sin.

   ^10Create a clean heart, Lord, renew

   a right sp'rit me within.


   ^11Cast me not from thy sight, nor take

   thy Holy Sp'rit away.

   ^12Restore me thy salvation's joy;

   with thy free Sp'rit me stay.


   ^13Then will I teach thy ways unto

   those that transgressors be;

   And those that sinners are shall then

   be turned unto thee.


   ^14O God, of my salvation God,

   me from blood-guiltiness

   Set free; then shall my tongue aloud

   sing of thy righteousness.


   ^15My closed lips, O Lord, by thee

   let them be opened;

   Then shall thy praises by my mouth

   abroad be published.


   ^16For thou desir'st not sacrifice,

   else would I give it thee;

   Nor wilt thou with burnt-offering

   at all delighted be.


   ^17A broken spirit is to God

   a pleasing sacrifice:

   A broken and a contrite heart,

   Lord, thou wilt not despise.


   ^18Shew kindness, and do good, O Lord,

   to Sion, thine own hill:

   The walls of thy Jerusalem

   build up of thy good will.


   ^19Then righteous off rings shall thee please,

   and off rings burnt, which they

   With whole burnt-off rings, and with calves,

   shall on thine altar lay.

Psalm 52

   To the chief Musician, Maschil, A Psalm of David, when Doeg the Edomite
   came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of
   Ahimelech.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Why dost thou boast, O mighty man,

   of mischief and of ill?

   The goodness of Almighty God

   endureth ever still.


   ^2Thy tongue mischievous calumnies

   deviseth subtilely,

   Like to a razor sharp to cut,

   working deceitfully.


   ^3Ill more than good, and more than truth

   thou lovest to speak wrong:

   ^4Thou lovest all-devouring words,

   O thou deceitful tongue.


   ^5So God shall thee destroy for aye,

   remove thee, pluck thee out

   Quite from thy house, out of the land

   of life he shall thee root.


   ^6The righteous shall it see, and fear,

   and laugh at him they shall:

   ^7Lo, this the man is that did not

   make God his strength at all:


   But he in his abundant wealth

   his confidence did place;

   And he took strength unto himself

   from his own wickedness.


   ^8But I am in the house of God

   like to an olive green:

   My confidence for ever hath

   upon God's mercy been.


   ^9And I for ever will thee praise,

   because thou hast done this:

   I on thy name will wait; for good

   before thy saints it is.

Psalm 53

   To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1That there is not a God, the fool

   doth in his heart conclude:

   They are corrupt, their works are vile,

   not one of them doth good.


   ^2The Lord upon the sons of men

   from heav'n did cast his eyes,

   To see if any one there was

   that sought God, and was wise.


   ^3They altogether filthy are,

   they all are backward gone;

   And there is none that doeth good,

   no, not so much as one.


   ^4These workers of iniquity,

   do they not know at all,

   That they my people eat as bread,

   and on God do not call?


   ^5Ev'n there they were afraid, and stood

   with trembling, all dismay'd,

   Whereas there was no cause at all

   why they should be afraid:


   For God his bones that thee besieg'd

   hath scatter'd all abroad;

   Thou hast confounded them, for they

   despised are of God.


   ^6Let Isr'el's help from Sion come:

   when back the Lord shall bring

   His captives, Jacob shall rejoice,

   and Israel shall sing.

Psalm 54

   To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David, when the
   Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Save me, O God, by thy great name,

   and judge me by thy strength:

   ^2My prayer hear, O God; give ear

   unto my words at length.


   ^3For they that strangers are to me

   do up against me rise;

   Oppressors seek my soul, and God

   set not before their eyes.


   ^4The Lord my God my helper is,

   lo, therefore I am bold:

   He taketh part with ev'ry one

   that doth my soul uphold.


   ^5Unto mine enemies he shall

   mischief and ill repay:

   O for thy truth's sake cut them off,

   and sweep them clean away.


   ^6I will a sacrifice to thee

   give with free willingness;

   Thy name, O Lord, because tis good,

   with praise I will confess.


   ^7For he hath me delivered

   from all adversities;

   And his desire mine eye hath seen

   upon mine enemies.

Psalm 55

   To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, hear my pray'r, hide not thyself

   from my entreating voice:

   ^2Attend and hear me; in my plaint

   I mourn and make a noise.


   ^3Because of th' en'my's voice, and for

   lewd men's oppression great:

   On me they cast iniquity,

   and they in wrath me hate.


   ^4Sore pain'd within me is my heart:

   death's terrors on me fall.

   ^5On me comes trembling, fear and dread

   o'erwhelmed me withal.


   ^6O that I, like a dove, had wings,

   said I, then would I flee

   Far hence, that I might find a place

   where I in rest might be.


   ^7Lo, then far off I wander would,

   and in the desert stay;

   ^8From windy storm and tempest I

   would haste to scape away.


   ^9O Lord, on them destruction bring,

   and do their tongues divide;

   For in the city violence

   and strife I have espy'd.


   ^10They day and night upon the walls

   do go about it round:

   There mischief is, and sorrow there

   in midst of it is found.


   ^11Abundant wickedness there is

   within her inward part;

   And from her streets deceitfulness

   and guile do not depart.


   ^12He was no foe that me reproach'd,

   then that endure I could;

   Nor hater that did gainst me boast,

   from him me hide I would.


   ^13But thou, man, who mine equal, guide,

   and mine acquaintance wast:

   ^14We join'd sweet counsels, to God's house

   in company we past.


   ^15Let death upon them seize, and down

   let them go quick to hell;

   For wickedness doth much abound

   among them where they dwell.


   ^16I'll call on God: God will me save.

   ^17I'll pray, and make a noise

   At ev'ning, morning, and at noon;

   and he shall hear my voice.


   ^18He hath my soul delivered,

   that it in peace might be

   From battle that against me was;

   for many were with me.


   ^19The Lord shall hear, and them afflict,

   of old who hath abode:

   Because they never changes have,

   therefore they fear not God.


   ^20'Gainst those that were at peace with him

   he hath put forth his hand:

   The covenant that he had made,

   by breaking he profan'd.


   ^21More smooth than butter were his words,

   while in his heart was war;

   His speeches were more soft than oil,

   and yet drawn swords they are.


   ^22Cast thou thy burden on the Lord,

   and he shall thee sustain;

   Yea, he shall cause the righteous man

   unmoved to remain.


   ^23But thou, O Lord my God, those men

   in justice shalt o'erthrow,

   And in destruction's dungeon dark

   at last shalt lay them low:


   The bloody and deceitful men

   shall not live half their days:

   But upon thee with confidence

   I will depend always.

Psalm 56

   To the chief Musician upon Jonath-elem-rechokim, Michtam of David, when
   the Philistines took him in Gath.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Shew mercy, Lord, to me, for man

   would swallow me outright;

   He me oppresseth, while he doth

   against me daily fight.


   ^2They daily would me swallow up

   that hate me spitefully;

   For they be many that do fight

   against me, O most High.


   ^3When I'm afraid I'll trust in thee:

   ^4In God I'll praise his word;

   I will not fear what flesh can do,

   my trust is in the Lord.


   ^5Each day they wrest my words; their thoughts

   'gainst me are all for ill.

   ^6They meet, they lurk, they mark my steps,

   waiting my soul to kill.


   ^7But shall they by iniquity

   escape thy judgments so?

   O God, with indignation down

   do thou the people throw.


   ^8My wand'rings all what they have been

   thou know'st, their number took;

   Into thy bottle put my tears:

   are they not in thy book?


   ^9My foes shall, when I cry, turn back;

   I know't, God is for me.

   ^10In God his word I'll praise; his word

   in God shall praised be.


   ^11In God I trust; I will not fear

   what man can do to me.

   ^12Thy vows upon me are, O God:

   I'll render praise to thee.


   ^13Wilt thou not, who from death me sav'd,

   my feet from falls keep free,

   To walk before God in the light

   of those that living be?

Psalm 57

   To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from
   Saul in the cave.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Be merciful to me, O God;

   thy mercy unto me

   Do thou extend; because my soul

   doth put her trust in thee:


   Yea, in the shadow of thy wings

   my refuge I will place,

   Until these sad calamities

   do wholly overpass.


   ^2My cry I will cause to ascend

   unto the Lord most high;

   To God, who doth all things for me

   perform most perfectly.


   ^3From heav'n he shall send down, and me

   from his reproach defend

   That would devour me: God his truth

   and mercy forth shall send.


   ^4My soul among fierce lions is,

   I firebrands live among,

   Men's sons, whose teeth are spears and darts,

   a sharp sword is their tongue.


   ^5Be thou exalted very high

   above the heav'ns, O God;

   Let thou thy glory be advanc'd

   o'er all the earth abroad.


   ^6My soul's bow'd down; for they a net

   have laid, my steps to snare:

   Into the pit which they have digg'd

   for me, they fallen are.


   ^7My heart is fix'd, my heart is fix'd,

   O God; I'll sing and praise.

   ^8My glory wake; wake psalt'ry, harp;

   myself I'll early raise.


   ^9I'll praise thee mong the people, Lord;

   'mong nations sing will I:

   ^10For great to heav'n thy mercy is,

   thy truth is to the sky.


   ^11O Lord, exalted be thy name

   above the heav'ns to stand:

   Do thou thy glory far advance

   above both sea and land.

Psalm 58

   To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Do ye, O congregation,

   indeed speak righteousness?

   O ye that are the sons of men,

   judge ye with uprightness?


   ^2Yea, ev'n within your very hearts

   ye wickedness have done;

   And ye the vi'lence of your hands

   do weigh the earth upon.


   ^3The wicked men estranged are,

   ev'n from the very womb;

   They, speaking lies, do stray as soon

   as to the world they come.


   ^4Unto a serpent's poison like

   their poison doth appear;

   Yea, they are like the adder deaf,

   that closely stops her ear;


   ^5That so she may not hear the voice

   of one that charm her would,

   No, not though he most cunning were,

   and charm most wisely could.


   ^6Their teeth, O God, within their mouth

   break thou in pieces small;

   The great teeth break thou out, O Lord,

   of these young lions all.


   ^7Let them like waters melt away,

   which downward still do flow:

   In pieces cut his arrows all,

   when he shall bend his bow.


   ^8Like to a snail that melts away,

   let each of them be gone;

   Like woman's birth untimely, that

   they never see the sun.


   ^9He shall them take away before

   your pots the thorns can find,

   Both living, and in fury great,

   as with a stormy wind.


   ^10The righteous, when he vengeance sees,

   he shall be joyful then;

   The righteous one shall wash his feet

   in blood of wicked men.


   ^11So men shall say, The righteous man

   reward shall never miss:

   And verily upon the earth

   a God to judge there is.

Psalm 59

   To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent,
   and they watched the house to kill him.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1My God, deliver me from those

   that are mine enemies;

   And do thou me defend from those

   that up against me rise.


   ^2Do thou deliver me from them

   that work iniquity;

   And give me safety from the men

   of bloody cruelty.


   ^3For, lo, they for my soul lay wait:

   the mighty do combine

   Against me, Lord; not for my fault,

   nor any sin of mine.


   ^4They run, and, without fault in me,

   themselves do ready make:

   Awake to meet me with thy help;

   and do thou notice take.


   ^5Awake therefore, Lord God of hosts,

   thou God of Israel,

   To visit heathen all: spare none

   that wickedly rebel.


   ^6At ev'ning they go to and fro;

   they make great noise and sound,

   Like to a dog, and often walk

   about the city round.


   ^7Behold, they belch out with their mouth,

   and in their lips are swords:

   For they do say thus, Who is he

   that now doth hear our words?


   ^8But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them,

   and all the heathen mock.

   ^9While he's in pow'r I'll wait on thee;

   for God is my high rock.


   ^10He of my mercy that is God

   betimes shall me prevent;

   Upon mine en'mies God shall let

   me see mine heart's content.


   ^11Them slay not, lest my folk forget;

   but scatter them abroad

   By thy strong pow'r; and bring them down,

   O thou our shield and God.


   ^12For their mouth's sin, and for the words

   that from their lips do fly,

   Let them be taken in their pride;

   because they curse and lie.


   ^13In wrath consume them, them consume,

   that so they may not be:

   And that in Jacob God doth rule

   to th' earth's ends let them see.


   ^14At ev'ning let thou them return,

   making great noise and sound,

   Like to a dog, and often walk

   about the city round.


   ^15And let them wander up and down,

   in seeking food to eat;

   And let them grudge when they shall not

   be satisfy'd with meat.


   ^16But of thy pow'r I'll sing aloud;

   at morn thy mercy praise:

   For thou to me my refuge wast,

   and tow'r, in troublous days.


   ^17O God, thou art my strength, I will

   sing praises unto thee;

   For God is my defence, a God

   of mercy unto me.

Psalm 60

   To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach;
   when he strove with Aram-naharaim, and with Aram-zobah, when Joab
   returned and smote of Edom, in the valley of Salt, twelve thousand.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord, thou hast rejected us,

   and scatter'd us abroad;

   Thou justly hast displeased been;

   return to us, O God.


   ^2The earth to tremble thou hast made;

   therein didst breaches make:

   Do thou thereof the breaches heal,

   because the land doth shake.


   ^3Unto thy people thou hard things

   hast shew'd, and on them sent;

   And thou hast caused us to drink

   wine of astonishment.


   ^4And yet a banner thou hast giv'n

   to them who thee do fear;

   That it by them, because of truth,

   displayed may appear.


   ^5That thy beloved people may

   deliver'd be from thrall,

   Save with the pow'r of thy right hand,

   and hear me when I call.


   ^6God in his holiness hath spoke;

   herein I will take pleasure:

   Shechem I will divide, and forth

   will Succoth's valley measure.


   ^7Gilead I claim as mine by right;

   Manasseh mine shall be;

   Ephraim is of mine head the strength;

   Judah gives laws for me;


   ^8Moab's my washing-pot; my shoe

   I'll over Edom throw;

   And over Palestina's land

   I will in triumph go.


   ^9O who is he will bring me to

   the city fortify'd?

   O who is he that to the land

   of Edom will me guide?


   ^10O God, which hadest us cast off,

   this thing wilt thou not do?

   Ev'n thou, O God, which didest not

   forth with our armies go?


   ^11Help us from trouble; for the help

   is vain which man supplies.

   ^12Through God we'll do great acts; he shall

   tread down our enemies.

Psalm 61

   To the chief Musician upon Neginoth, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O God, give ear unto my cry;

   unto my pray'r attend.

   ^2From th' utmost corner of the land

   my cry to thee I'll send.


   What time my heart is overwhelm'd,

   and in perplexity,

   Do thou me lead unto the Rock

   that higher is than I.


   ^3For thou hast for my refuge been

   a shelter by thy pow'r;

   And for defence against my foes

   thou hast been a strong tow'r.


   ^4Within thy tabernacle I

   for ever will abide;

   And under covert of thy wings

   with confidence me hide.


   ^5For thou the vows that I did make,

   O Lord my God, didst hear:

   Thou hast giv'n me the heritage

   of those thy name that fear.


   ^6A life prolong'd for many days

   thou to the king shalt give;

   Like many generations be

   the years which he shall live.


   ^7He in God's presence his abode

   for evermore shall have:

   O do thou truth and mercy both

   prepare, that may him save.


   ^8And so will I perpetually

   sing praise unto thy name;

   That having made my vows, I may

   each day perform the same.

Psalm 62

   To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1My soul with expectation

   depends on God indeed;

   My strength and my salvation doth

   from him alone proceed.


   ^2He only my salvation is,

   and my strong rock is he:

   He only is my sure defence;

   much mov'd I shall not be.


   ^3How long will ye against a man

   plot mischief? ye shall all

   Be slain; ye as a tott'ring fence

   shall be, and bowing wall.


   ^4They only plot to cast him down

   from his excellency:

   They joy in lies; with mouth they bless,

   but they curse inwardly.


   ^5My soul, wait thou with patience

   upon thy God alone;

   On him dependeth all my hope

   and expectation.


   ^6He only my salvation is,

   and my strong rock is he;

   He only is my sure defence:

   I shall not moved be.


   ^7In God my glory placed is,

   and my salvation sure;

   In God the rock is of my strength,

   my refuge most secure.


   ^8Ye people, place your confidence

   in him continually;

   Before him pour ye out your heart:

   God is our refuge high.


   ^9Surely mean men are vanity,

   and great men are a lie;

   In balance laid, they wholly are

   more light than vanity.


   ^10Trust ye not in oppression,

   in robb'ry be not vain;

   On wealth set not your hearts, when as

   increased is your gain.


   ^11God hath it spoken once to me,

   yea, this I heard again,

   That power to Almighty God

   alone doth appertain.


   ^12Yea, mercy also unto thee

   belongs, O Lord, alone:

   For thou according to his work

   rewardest ev'ry one.

Psalm 63

   A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, thee my God, I'll early seek:

   my soul doth thirst for thee;

   My flesh longs in a dry parch'd land,

   wherein no waters be:


   ^2That I thy power may behold,

   and brightness of thy face,

   As I have seen thee heretofore

   within thy holy place.


   ^3Since better is thy love than life,

   my lips thee praise shall give.

   ^4I in thy name will lift my hands,

   and bless thee while I live.


   ^5Ev'n as with marrow and with fat

   my soul shall filled be;

   Then shall my mouth with joyful lips

   sing praises unto thee:


   ^6When I do thee upon my bed

   remember with delight,

   And when on thee I meditate

   in watches of the night.


   ^7In shadow of thy wings I'll joy;

   for thou mine help hast been.

   ^8My soul thee follows hard; and me

   thy right hand doth sustain.


   ^9Who seek my soul to spill shall sink

   down to earth's lowest room.

   ^10They by the sword shall be cut off,

   and foxes' prey become.


   ^11Yet shall the king in God rejoice,

   and each one glory shall

   That swear by him: but stopp'd shall be

   the mouth of liars all.

Psalm 64

   8,6,8,6


   ^1When I to thee my prayer make,

   Lord, to my voice give ear;

   My life save from the enemy,

   of whom I stand in fear.


   ^2Me from their secret counsel hide

   who do live wickedly;

   From insurrection of those men

   that work iniquity:


   ^3Who do their tongues with malice whet,

   and make them cut like swords;

   In whose bent bows are arrows set,

   ev'n sharp and bitter words:


   ^4That they may at the perfect man

   in secret aim their shot;

   Yea, suddenly they dare at him

   to shoot, and fear it not.


   ^5In ill encourage they themselves,

   and their snares close do lay:

   Together conference they have;

   Who shall them see? they say.


   ^6They have search'd out iniquities,

   a perfect search they keep:

   Of each of them the inward thought,

   and very heart, is deep.


   ^7God shall an arrow shoot at them,

   and wound them suddenly:

   ^8So their own tongue shall them confound;

   all who them see shall fly.


   ^9And on all men a fear shall fall,

   God's works they shall declare;

   For they shall wisely notice take

   what these his doings are.


   ^10In God the righteous shall rejoice,

   and trust upon his might;

   Yea, they shall greatly glory all

   in heart that are upright.

Psalm 65

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm and Song of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Praise waits for thee in Sion, Lord:

   to thee vows paid shall be.

   ^2O thou that hearer art of pray'r,

   all flesh shall come to thee.


   ^3Iniquities, I must confess,

   prevail against me do:

   But as for our transgressions,

   them purge away shalt thou.


   ^4Bless'd is the man whom thou dost chuse,

   and mak'st approach to thee,

   That he within thy courts, O Lord,

   may still a dweller be:


   We surely shall be satisfy'd

   with thy abundant grace,

   And with the goodness of thy house,

   ev'n of thy holy place.


   ^5O God of our salvation,

   thou, in thy righteousness,

   By fearful works unto our pray'rs

   thine answer dost express:


   Therefore the ends of all the earth,

   and those afar that be

   Upon the sea, their confidence,

   O Lord, will place in thee.


   ^6Who, being girt with pow'r, sets fast

   by his great strength the hills.

   ^7Who noise of seas, noise of their waves,

   and people's tumult, stills.


   ^8Those in the utmost parts that dwell

   are at thy signs afraid:

   Th' outgoings of the morn and ev'n

   by thee are joyful made.


   ^9The earth thou visit'st, wat'ring it;

   thou mak'st it rich to grow

   With God's full flood; thou corn prepar'st,

   when thou provid'st it so.


   ^10Her rigs thou wat'rest plenteously,

   her furrows settelest:

   With show'rs thou dost her mollify,

   her spring by thee is blest.


   ^11So thou the year most lib'rally

   dost with thy goodness crown;

   And all thy paths abundantly

   on us drop fatness down.


   ^12They drop upon the pastures wide,

   that do in deserts lie;

   The little hills on ev'ry side

   rejoice right pleasantly.


   ^13With flocks the pastures clothed be,

   the vales with corn are clad;

   And now they shout and sing to thee,

   for thou hast made them glad.

Psalm 66

   To the chief Musician, A Song or Psalm.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1All lands to God in joyful sounds,

   aloft your voices raise.

   ^2Sing forth the honour of his name,

   and glorious make his praise.


   ^3Say unto God, How terrible

   in all thy works art thou!

   Through thy great pow'r thy foes to thee

   shall be constrain'd to bow.


   ^4All on the earth shall worship thee,

   they shall thy praise proclaim

   In songs: they shall sing cheerfully

   unto thy holy name.


   ^5Come, and the works that God hath wrought

   with admiration see:

   In's working to the sons of men

   most terrible is he.


   ^6Into dry land the sea he turn'd,

   and they a passage had;

   Ev'n marching through the flood on foot,

   there we in him were glad.


   ^7He ruleth ever by his pow'r;

   his eyes the nations see:

   O let not the rebellious ones

   lift up themselves on high.


   ^8Ye people, bless our God; aloud

   the voice speak of his praise:

   ^9Our soul in life who safe preserves,

   our foot from sliding stays.


   ^10For thou didst prove and try us, Lord,

   as men do silver try;

   ^11Brought'st us into the net, and mad'st

   bands on our loins to lie.


   ^12Thou hast caus'd men ride o'er our heads;

   and though that we did pass

   Through fire and water, yet thou brought'st

   us to a wealthy place.


   ^13I'll bring burnt off rings to thy house;

   to thee my vows I'll pay,

   ^14Which my lips utter'd, my mouth spake,

   when trouble on me lay.


   ^15Burnt-sacrifices of fat rams

   with incense I will bring;

   Of bullocks and of goats I will

   present an offering.


   ^16All that fear God, come, hear, I'll tell

   what he did for my soul.

   ^17I with my mouth unto him cry'd,

   my tongue did him extol.


   ^18If in my heart I sin regard,

   the Lord me will not hear:

   ^19But surely God me heard, and to

   my prayer's voice gave ear.


   ^20O let the Lord, our gracious God,

   for ever blessed be,

   Who turned not my pray'r from him,

   nor yet his grace from me.

Psalm 68

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm or Song of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Let God arise, and scattered

   let all his en'mies be;

   And let all those that do him hate

   before his presence flee.


   ^2As smoke is driv'n, so drive thou them;

   as fire melts wax away,

   Before God's face let wicked men

   so perish and decay.


   ^3But let the righteous be glad:

   let them before God's sight

   Be very joyful; yea, let them

   rejoice with all their might.


   ^4To God sing, to his name sing praise;

   extol him with your voice,

   That rides on heav'n, by his name Jah,

   before his face rejoice.


   ^5Because the Lord a father is

   unto the fatherless;

   God is the widow's judge, within

   his place of holiness.


   ^6God doth the solitary set

   in fam'lies: and from bands

   The chain'd doth free; but rebels do

   inhabit parched lands.


   ^7O God, what time thou didst go forth

   before thy people's face;

   And when through the great wilderness

   thy glorious marching was;


   ^8Then at God's presence shook the earth,

   then drops from heaven fell;

   This Sinai shook before the Lord,

   the God of Israel.


   ^9O God, thou to thine heritage

   didst send a plenteous rain,

   Whereby thou, when it weary was,

   didst it refresh again.


   ^10Thy congregation then did make

   their habitation there:

   Of thine own goodness for the poor,

   O God, thou didst prepare.


   ^11The Lord himself did give the word,

   the word abroad did spread;

   Great was the company of them

   the same who published.


   ^12Kings of great armies foiled were,

   and forc'd to flee away;

   And women, who remain'd at home,

   did distribute the prey.


   ^13Though ye have lien among the pots,

   like doves ye shall appear,

   Whose wings with silver, and with gold

   whose feathers cover'd are.


   ^14When there th' Almighty scatter'd kings,

   like Salmon's snow twas white.

   ^15God's hill is like to Bashan hill,

   like Bashan hill for height.


   ^16Why do ye leap, ye mountains high?

   this is the hill where God

   Desires to dwell; yea, God in it

   for aye will make abode.


   ^17God's chariots twenty thousand are,

   thousands of angels strong;

   In's holy place God is, as in

   mount Sinai, them among.


   ^18Thou hast, O Lord, most glorious,

   ascended up on high;

   And in triumph victorious led

   captive captivity:


   Thou hast received gifts for men,

   for such as did rebel;

   Yea, ev'n for them, that God the Lord

   in midst of them might dwell.


   ^19Bless'd be the Lord, who is to us

   of our salvation God;

   Who daily with his benefits

   us plenteously doth load.


   ^20He of salvation is the God,

   who is our God most strong;

   And unto God the Lord from death

   the issues do belong.


   ^21But surely God shall wound the head

   of those that are his foes;

   The hairy scalp of him that still

   on in his trespass goes.


   ^22God said, My people I will bring

   again from Bashan hill;

   Yea, from the sea's devouring depths

   them bring again I will;


   ^23That in the blood of enemies

   thy foot imbru'd may be,

   And of thy dogs dipp'd in the same

   the tongues thou mayest see.


   ^24Thy goings they have seen, O God;

   the steps of majesty

   Of my God, and my mighty King,

   within the sanctuary.


   ^25Before went singers, players next

   on instruments took way;

   And them among the damsels were

   that did on timbrels play.


   ^26Within the congregations

   bless God with one accord:

   From Isr'el's fountain do ye bless

   and praise the mighty Lord.


   ^27With their prince, little Benjamin,

   princes and council there

   Of Judah were, there Zabulon's

   and Napht'li's princes were.


   ^28Thy God commands thy strength; make strong

   what thou wrought'st for us, Lord.

   ^29For thy house at Jerusalem

   kings shall thee gifts afford.


   ^30The spearmen's host, the multitude

   of bulls, which fiercely look,

   Those calves which people have forth sent,

   O Lord our God, rebuke,


   Till ev'ry one submit himself,

   and silver pieces bring:

   The people that delight in war

   disperse, O God and King.


   ^31Those that be princes great shall then

   come out of Egypt lands;

   And Ethiopia to God

   shall soon stretch out her hands.


   ^32O all ye kingdoms of the earth,

   sing praises to this King;

   For he is Lord that ruleth all,

   unto him praises sing.


   ^33To him that rides on heav'ns of heav'ns,

   which he of old did found;

   Lo, he sends out his voice, a voice

   in might that doth abound.


   ^34Strength unto God do ye ascribe;

   for his excellency

   Is over Israel, his strength

   is in the clouds most high.


   ^35Thou'rt from thy temple dreadful, Lord;

   Isr'el's own God is he,

   Who gives his people strength and pow'r:

   O let God blessed be.

   Lord God of hosts, for me.


   O Lord, the God of Israel,

   let none, who search do make,

   And seek thee, be at any time

   confounded for my sake.


   ^7For I have borne reproach for thee,

   my face is hid with shame.

   ^8To brethren strange, to mother's sons

   an alien I became.


   ^9Because the zeal did eat me up,

   which to thine house I bear;

   And the reproaches cast at thee,

   upon me fallen are.


   ^10My tears and fasts, t' afflict my soul,

   were turned to my shame.

   ^11When sackcloth I did wear, to them

   a proverb I became.


   ^12The men that in the gate do sit

   against me evil spake;

   They also that vile drunkards were

   of me their song did make.


   ^13But, in an acceptable time,

   my pray'r, Lord, is to thee:

   In truth of thy salvation, Lord,

   and mercy great, hear me.


   ^14Deliver me out of the mire,

   from sinking do me keep;

   Free me from those that do me hate,

   and from the waters deep.


   ^15Let not the flood on me prevail,

   whose water overflows;

   Nor deep me swallow, nor the pit

   her mouth upon me close.


   ^16Hear me, O Lord, because thy love

   and kindness is most good;

   Turn unto me, according to

   thy mercies' multitude.


   ^17Nor from thy servant hide thy face:

   I'm troubled, soon attend.

   ^18Draw near my soul, and it redeem;

   me from my foes defend.


   ^19To thee is my reproach well known,

   my shame, and my disgrace:

   Those that mine adversaries be

   are all before thy face.


   ^20Reproach hath broke my heart; I'm full

   of grief: I look'd for one

   To pity me, but none I found;

   comforters found I none.


   ^21They also bitter gall did give

   unto me for my meat:

   They gave me vinegar to drink,

   when as my thirst was great.


   ^22Before them let their table prove

   a snare; and do thou make

   Their welfare and prosperity

   a trap themselves to take.


   ^23Let thou their eyes so darken'd be,

   that sight may them forsake;

   And let their loins be made by thee

   continually to shake.


   ^24Thy fury pour thou out on them,

   and indignation;

   And let thy wrathful anger, Lord,

   fast hold take them upon.


   ^25All waste and desolate let be

   their habitation;

   And in their tabernacles all

   inhabitants be none.


   ^26Because him they do persecute,

   whom thou didst smite before;

   They talk unto the grief of those

   whom thou hast wounded sore.


   ^27Add thou iniquity unto

   their former wickedness;

   And do not let them come at all

   into thy righteousness.


   ^28Out of the book of life let them

   be raz'd and blotted quite;

   Among the just and righteous

   let not their names be writ.


   ^29But now become exceeding poor

   and sorrowful am I:

   By thy salvation, O my God,

   let me be set on high.


   ^30The name of God I with a song

   most cheerfully will praise;

   And I, in giving thanks to him,

   his name shall highly raise.


   ^31This to the Lord a sacrifice

   more gracious shall prove

   Than bullock, ox, or any beast

   that hath both horn and hoof.


   ^32When this the humble men shall see,

   it joy to them shall give:

   O all ye that do seek the Lord,

   your hearts shall ever live.


   ^33For God the poor hears, and will not

   his prisoners contemn.

   ^34Let heav'n, and earth, and seas, him praise,

   and all that move in them.


   ^35For God will Judah's cities build,

   and he will Sion save,

   That they may dwell therein, and it

   in sure possession have.


   ^36And they that are his servants' seed

   inherit shall the same;

   So shall they have their dwelling there

   that love his blessed name.

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.

First Version (S.M.)

   6,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, haste me to deliver;

   with speed, Lord, succour me.

   ^2Let them that for my soul do seek

   sham'd and confounded be:


   Turn'd back be they, and sham'd,

   that in my hurt delight.

   ^3Turn'd back be they, Ha, ha! that say,

   their shaming to requite.


   ^4In thee let all be glad,

   and joy that seek for thee:

   Let them who thy salvation love

   say still, God praised be.


   ^5I poor and needy am;

   come, Lord, and make no stay:

   My help thou and deliv'rer art;

   O Lord, make no delay.

Psalm 70

Second Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Make haste, O God, me to preserve;

   with speed, Lord, succour me.

   ^2Let them that for my soul do seek

   sham'd and confounded be:


   Let them be turned back, and sham'd,

   that in my hurt delight.

   ^3Turn'd back be they, Ha, ha! that say,

   their shaming to requite.


   ^4O Lord, in thee let all be glad,

Psalm 71

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord, my hope and confidence

   is plac'd in thee alone;

   Then let thy servant never be

   put to confusion.


   ^2And let me, in thy righteousness,

   from thee deliv'rance have;

   Cause me escape, incline thine ear

   unto me, and me save.


   ^3Be thou my dwelling-rock, to which

   I ever may resort:

   Thou gav'st commandment me to save,

   for thou'rt my rock and fort.


   ^4Free me, my God, from wicked hands,

   hands cruel and unjust:

   ^5For thou, O Lord God, art my hope,

   and from my youth my trust.


   ^6Thou from the womb didst hold me up;

   thou art the same that me

   Out of my mother's bowels took;

   I ever will praise thee.


   ^7To many I a wonder am;

   but thou'rt my refuge strong.

   ^8Fill'd let my mouth be with thy praise

   and honour all day long.


   ^9O do not cast me off, when as

   old age doth overtake me;

   And when my strength decayed is,

   then do not thou forsake me.


   ^10For those that are mine enemies

   against me speak with hate;

   And they together counsel take

   that for my soul lay wait.


   ^11They said, God leaves him; him pursue

   and take: none will him save.

   ^12Be thou not far from me, my God:

   thy speedy help I crave.


   ^13Confound, consume them, that unto

   my soul are enemies:

   Cloth'd be they with reproach and shame

   that do my hurt devise.


   ^14But I with expectation

   will hope continually;

   And yet with praises more and more

   I will thee magnify.


   ^15Thy justice and salvation

   my mouth abroad shall show,

   Ev'n all the day; for I thereof

   the numbers do not know.


   ^16And I will constantly go on

   in strength of God the Lord;

   And thine own righteousness, ev'n thine

   alone, I will record.


   ^17For even from my youth, O God,

   by thee I have been taught;

   And hitherto I have declar'd

   the wonders thou hast wrought.


   ^18And now, Lord, leave me not, when I

   old and gray-headed grow:

   Till to this age thy strength and pow'r

   to all to come I show.


   ^19And thy most perfect righteousness

   O Lord, is very high,

   Who hast so great things done: O God,

   who is like unto thee?


   ^20Thou, Lord, who great adversities,

   and sore, to me didst show,

   Shalt quicken, and bring me again

   from depths of earth below.


   ^21My greatness and my pow'r thou wilt

   increase, and far extend:

   On ev'ry side against all grief

   thou wilt me comfort send.


   ^22Thee, ev'n thy truth, I'll also praise,

   my God, with psaltery:

   Thou Holy One of Israel,

   with harp I'll sing to thee.


   ^23My lips shall much rejoice in thee,

   when I thy praises sound;

   My soul, which thou redeemed hast,

   in joy shall much abound.


   ^24My tongue thy justice shall proclaim,

   continuing all day long;

   For they confounded are, and sham'd,

   that seek to do me wrong.

Psalm 72

   A Psalm for Solomon.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord, thy judgments give the king,

   his son thy righteousness.

   ^2With right he shall thy people judge,

   thy poor with uprightness.


   ^3The lofty mountains shall bring forth

   unto the people peace;

   Likewise the little hills the same

   shall do by righteousness.


   ^4The people's poor ones he shall judge,

   the needy's children save;

   And those shall he in pieces break

   who them oppressed have.


   ^5They shall thee fear, while sun and moon

   do last, through ages all.

   ^6Like rain on mown grass he shall drop,

   or show'rs on earth that fall.


   ^7The just shall flourish in his days,

   and prosper in his reign:

   He shall, while doth the moon endure,

   abundant peace maintain.


   ^8His large and great dominion shall

   from sea to sea extend:

   It from the river shall reach forth

   unto earth's utmost end.


   ^9They in the wilderness that dwell

   bow down before him must;

   And they that are his enemies

   shall lick the very dust.


   ^10The kings of Tarshish, and the isles,

   to him shall presents bring;

   And unto him shall offer gifts

   Sheba's and Seba's king.


   ^11Yea, all the mighty kings on earth

   before him down shall fall;

   And all the nations of the world

   do service to him shall.


   ^12For he the needy shall preserve,

   when he to him doth call;

   The poor also, and him that hath

   no help of man at all.


   ^13The poor man and the indigent

   in mercy he shall spare;

   He shall preserve alive the souls

   of those that needy are.


   ^14Both from deceit and violence

   their soul he shall set free;

   And in his sight right precious

   and dear their blood shall be.


   ^15Yea, he shall live, and giv'n to him

   shall be of Sheba's gold:

   For him still shall they pray, and he

   shall daily be extoll'd.


   ^16Of corn an handful in the earth

   on tops of mountains high,

   With prosp'rous fruit shall shake, like trees

   on Lebanon that be.


   The city shall be flourishing,

   her citizens abound

   In number shall, like to the grass

   that grows upon the ground.


   ^17His name for ever shall endure;

   last like the sun it shall:

   Men shall be bless'd in him, and bless'd

   all nations shall him call.


   ^18Now blessed be the Lord our God,

   the God of Israel,

   For he alone doth wondrous works,

   in glory that excel.


   ^19And blessed be his glorious name

   to all eternity:

   The whole earth let his glory fill.

   Amen, so let it be.

Psalm 73

   A Psalm of Asaph.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Yet God is good to Israel,

   to each pure-hearted one.

   ^2But as for me, my steps near slipp'd,

   my feet were almost gone.


   ^3For I envious was, and grudg'd

   the foolish folk to see,

   When I perceiv'd the wicked sort

   enjoy prosperity.


   ^4For still their strength continueth firm;

   their death of bands is free.

   ^5They are not toil'd like other men,

   nor plagu'd, as others be.


   ^6Therefore their pride, like to a chain,

   them compasseth about;

   And, as a garment, violence

   doth cover them throughout.


   ^7Their eyes stand out with fat; they have

   more than their hearts could wish.

   ^8They are corrupt; their talk of wrong

   both lewd and lofty is.


   ^9They set their mouth against the heav'ns

   in their blasphemous talk;

   And their reproaching tongue throughout

   the earth at large doth walk.


   ^10His people oftentimes for this

   look back, and turn about;

   Sith waters of so full a cup

   to these are poured out.


   ^11And thus they say, How can it be

   that God these things doth know?

   Or, Can there in the Highest be

   knowledge of things below?


   ^12Behold, these are the wicked ones,

   yet prosper at their will

   In worldly things; they do increase

   in wealth and riches still.


   ^13I verily have done in vain

   my heart to purify;

   To no effect in innocence

   washed my hands have I.


   ^14For daily, and all day throughout,

   great plagues I suffer'd have;

   Yea, ev'ry morning I of new

   did chastisement receive.


   ^15If in this manner foolishly

   to speak I would intend,

   Thy children's generation,

   behold, I should offend.


   ^16When I this thought to know, it was

   too hard a thing for me;

   ^17Till to God's sanctuary I went,

   then I their end did see.


   ^18Assuredly thou didst them set

   a slipp'ry place upon;

   Them suddenly thou castedst down

   into destruction.


   ^19How in a moment suddenly

   to ruin brought are they!

   With fearful terrors utterly

   they are consum'd away.


   ^20Ev'n like unto a dream, when one

   from sleeping doth arise;

   So thou, O Lord, when thou awak'st,

   their image shalt despise.


   ^21Thus grieved was my heart in me,

   and me my reins opprest:

   ^22So rude was I, and ignorant,

   and in thy sight a beast.


   ^23Nevertheless continually,

   O Lord, I am with thee:

   Thou dost me hold by my right hand,

   and still upholdest me.


   ^24Thou, with thy counsel, while I live,

   wilt me conduct and guide;

   And to thy glory afterward

   receive me to abide.


   ^25Whom have I in the heavens high

   but thee, O Lord, alone?

   And in the earth whom I desire

   besides thee there is none.


   ^26My flesh and heart doth faint and fail,

   but God doth fail me never:

   For of my heart God is the strength

   and portion for ever.


   ^27For, lo, they that are far from thee

   for ever perish shall;

   Them that a whoring from thee go

   thou hast destroyed all.


   ^28But surely it is good for me

   that I draw near to God:

   In God I trust, that all thy works

   I may declare abroad.

Psalm 74

   Maschil of Asaph.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O God, why hast thou cast us off?

   is it for evermore?

   Against thy pasture-sheep why doth

   thine anger smoke so sore?


   ^2O call to thy rememberance

   thy congregation,

   Which thou hast purchased of old;

   still think the same upon:


   The rod of thine inheritance,

   which thou redeemed hast,

   This Sion hill, wherein thou hadst

   thy dwelling in times past.


   ^3To these long desolations

   thy feet lift, do not tarry;

   For all the ills thy foes have done

   within thy sanctuary.


   ^4Amidst thy congregations

   thine enemies do roar:

   Their ensigns they set up for signs

   of triumph thee before.


   ^5A man was famous, and was had

   in estimation,

   According as he lifted up

   his axe thick trees upon.


   ^6But all at once with axes now

   and hammers they go to,

   And down the carved work thereof

   they break, and quite undo.


   ^7They fired have thy sanctuary,

   and have defil'd the same,

   By casting down unto the ground

   the place where dwelt thy name.


   ^8Thus said they in their hearts, Let us

   destroy them out of hand:

   They burnt up all the synagogues

   of God within the land.


   ^9Our signs we do not now behold;

   there is not us among

   A prophet more, nor any one

   that knows the time how long.


   ^10How long, Lord, shall the enemy

   thus in reproach exclaim?

   And shall the adversary thus

   always blaspheme thy name?


   ^11Thy hand, ev'n thy right hand of might,

   why dost thou thus draw back?

   O from thy bosom pluck it out

   for our deliv'rance sake.


   ^12For certainly God is my King,

   ev'n from the times of old,

   Working in midst of all the earth

   salvation manifold.


   ^13The sea, by thy great pow'r, to part

   asunder thou didst make;

   And thou the dragons' heads, O Lord,

   within the waters brake.


   ^14The leviathan's head thou brak'st

   in pieces, and didst give

   Him to be meat unto the folk

   in wilderness that live.


   ^15Thou clav'st the fountain and the flood,

   which did with streams abound:

   Thou dry'dst the mighty waters up

   unto the very ground.


   ^16Thine only is the day, O Lord,

   thine also is the night;

   And thou alone prepared hast

   the sun and shining light.


   ^17By thee the borders of the earth

   were settled ev'ry where:

   The summer and the winter both

   by thee created were.


   ^18That th' enemy reproached hath,

   O keep it in record;

   And that the foolish people have

   blasphem'd thy name, O Lord.


   ^19Unto the multitude do not

   thy turtle's soul deliver:

   The congregation of thy poor

   do not forget for ever.


   ^20Unto thy cov'nant have respect;

   for earth's dark places be

   Full of the habitations

   of horrid cruelty.


   ^21O let not those that be oppress'd

   return again with shame:

   Let those that poor and needy are

   give praise unto thy name.


   ^22Do thou, O God, arise and plead

   the cause that is thine own:

   Remember how thou art reproach'd

   still by the foolish one.


   ^23Do not forget the voice of those

   that are thine enemies:

   Of those the tumult ever grows

   that do against thee rise.

Psalm 75

   To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, A Psalm or Song of Asaph.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1To thee, O God, do we give thanks,

   we do give thanks to thee;

   Because thy wondrous works declare

   thy great name near to be.


   ^2I purpose, when I shall receive

   the congregation,

   That I shall judgment uprightly

   render to ev'ry one.


   ^3Dissolved is the land, with all

   that in the same do dwell;

   But I the pillars thereof do

   bear up, and stablish well.


   ^4I to the foolish people said,

   Do not deal foolishly;

   And unto those that wicked are,

   Lift not your horn on high.


   ^5Lift not your horn on high, nor speak

   ^6with stubborn neck. But know,

   That not from east, nor west, nor south,

   promotion doth flow.


   ^7But God is judge; he puts down one,

   and sets another up.

   ^8For in the hand of God most high

   of red wine is a cup:


   'Tis full of mixture, he pours forth,

   and makes the wicked all

   Wring out the bitter dregs thereof;

   yea, and they drink them shall.


   ^9But I for ever will declare,

   I Jacob's God will praise.

   ^10All horns of lewd men I'll cut off;

   but just men's horns will raise.

Psalm 76

   To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or Song of Asaph.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1In Judah's land God is well known,

   his name's in Isr'el great:

   ^2In Salem is his tabernacle,

   in Sion is his seat.


   ^3There arrows of the bow he brake,

   the shield, the sword, the war.

   ^4More glorious thou than hills of prey,

   more excellent art far.


   ^5Those that were stout of heart are spoil'd,

   they slept their sleep outright;

   And none of those their hands did find,

   that were the men of might.


   ^6When thy rebuke, O Jacob's God,

   had forth against them past,

   Their horses and their chariots both

   were in a dead sleep cast.


   ^7Thou, Lord, ev'n thou art he that should

   be fear'd; and who is he

   That may stand up before thy sight,

   if once thou angry be?


   ^8From heav'n thou judgment caus'd be heard;

   the earth was still with fear,

   ^9When God to judgment rose, to save

   all meek on earth that were.


   ^10Surely the very wrath of man

   unto thy praise redounds:

   Thou to the remnant of his wrath

   wilt set restraining bounds.


   ^11Vow to the Lord your God, and pay:

   all ye that near him be,

   Bring gifts and presents unto him;

   for to be fear'd is he.


   ^12By him the sp'rits shall be cut off

   of those that princes are:

   Unto the kings that are on earth

   he fearful doth appear.

Psalm 77

   To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Unto the Lord I with my voice,

   I unto God did cry;

   Ev'n with my voice, and unto me

   his ear he did apply.


   ^2I in my trouble sought the Lord,

   my sore by night did run,

   And ceased not; my grieved soul

   did consolation shun.


   ^3I to remembrance God did call,

   yet trouble did remain;

   And overwhelm'd my spirit was,

   whilst I did sore complain.


   ^4Mine eyes, debarr'd from rest and sleep,

   thou makest still to wake;

   My trouble is so great that I

   unable am to speak.


   ^5The days of old to mind I call'd,

   and oft did think upon

   The times and ages that are past

   full many years agone.


   ^6By night my song I call to mind,

   and commune with my heart;

   My sp'rit did carefully enquire

   how I might ease my smart.


   ^7For ever will the Lord cast off,

   and gracious be no more?

   ^8For ever is his mercy gone?

   fails his word evermore?


   ^9Is't true that to be gracious

   the Lord forgotten hath?

   And that his tender mercies he

   hath shut up in his wrath?


   ^10Then did I say, That surely this

   is mine infirmity:

   I'll mind the years of the right hand

   of him that is most High.


   ^11Yea, I remember will the works

   performed by the Lord:

   The wonders done of old by thee

   I surely will record.


   ^12I also will of all thy works

   my meditation make;

   And of thy doings to discourse

   great pleasure I will take.


   ^13O God, thy way most holy is

   within thy sanctuary;

   And what god is so great in pow'r

   as is our God most high?


   ^14Thou art the God that wonders do'st

   by thy right hand most strong:

   Thy mighty pow'r thou hast declar'd

   the nations among.


   ^15To thine own people with thine arm

   thou didst redemption bring;

   To Jacob's sons, and to the tribes

   of Joseph that do spring.


   ^16The waters, Lord, perceived thee,

   the waters saw thee well;

   And they for fear aside did flee;

   the depths on trembling fell.


   ^17The clouds in water forth were pour'd,

   sound loudly did the sky;

   And swiftly through the world abroad

   thine arrows fierce did fly.


   ^18Thy thunder's voice alongst the heav'n

   a mighty noise did make;

   By lightnings lighten'd was the world,

   th' earth tremble did and shake.


   ^19Thy way is in the sea, and in

   the waters great thy path;

   Yet are thy footsteps hid, O Lord;

   none knowledge thereof hath.


   ^20Thy people thou didst safely lead,

   like to a flock of sheep;

   By Moses' hand and Aaron's thou

   didst them conduct and keep.

   ^1Attend, my people, to my law;

   thereto give thou an ear;

   The words that from my mouth proceed

   attentively do hear.


   ^2My mouth shall speak a parable,

   and sayings dark of old;

   ^3The same which we have heard and known,

   and us our fathers told.


   ^4We also will them not conceal

   from their posterity;

   Them to the generation

   and his almighty strength,

   The wondrous works that he hath done,

   we will shew forth at length.

   to their succeeding race;


   ^6That so the race which was to come

   might well them learn and know;

   might to their sons them show:


   ^7That they might set their hope in God,

   and suffer not to fall

   His mighty works out of their mind,

   but keep his precepts all:


   ^8And might not, like their fathers, be

   a stiff rebellious race;

   A race not right in heart; with God

   whose sp'rit not stedfast was.


   ^9The sons of Ephraim, who nor bows

   nor other arms did lack,

   When as the day of battle was,

   they faintly turned back.


   ^10They brake God's cov'nant, and refus'd

   in his commands to go;

   ^11His works and wonders they forgot,

   which he to them did show.


   ^12Things marvellous he brought to pass;

   their fathers them beheld

   Within the land of Egypt done,

   yea, ev'n in Zoan's field.


   ^13By him divided was the sea,

   he caus'd them through to pass;

   And made the waters so to stand,

   as like an heap it was.


   ^14With cloud by day, with light of fire

   all night, he did them guide.

   ^15In desert rocks he clave, and drink,

   as from great depths, supply'd.


   ^16He from the rock brought streams, like floods

   made waters to run down.

   ^17Yet sinning more, in desert they

   provok'd the Highest One.


   ^18For in their heart they tempted God,

   and, speaking with mistrust,

   They greedily did meat require

   to satisfy their lust.


   ^19Against the Lord himself they spake,

   and, murmuring, said thus,

   A table in the wilderness

   can God prepare for us?


   ^20Behold, he smote the rock, and thence

   came streams and waters great;

   But can he give his people bread?

   and send them flesh to eat?


   ^21The Lord did hear, and waxed wroth;

   so kindled was a flame

   'Gainst Jacob, and gainst Israel

   up indignation came.


   ^22For they believ'd not God, nor trust

   in his salvation had;

   ^23Though clouds above he did command,

   and heav'n's doors open made,


   ^24And manna rain'd on them, and gave

   them corn of heav'n to eat.

   ^25Man angels' food did eat; to them

   he to the full sent meat.


   ^26And in the heaven he did cause

   an eastern wind to blow;

   And by his power he let out

   the southern wind to go.


   ^27Then flesh as thick as dust he made

   to rain down them among;

   And feather'd fowls, like as the sand

   which li'th the shore along.


   ^28At his command amidst their camp

   these show'rs of flesh down fell,

   All round about the tabernacles

   and tents where they did dwell.


   ^29So they did eat abundantly,

   and had of meat their fill;

   For he did give to them what was

   their own desire and will.


   ^30They from their lust had not estrang'd

   their heart and their desire;

   But while the meat was in their mouths,

   which they did so require,


   ^31God's wrath upon them came, and slew

   the fattest of them all;

   So that the choice of Israel,

   o'erthrown by death, did fall.


   ^32Yet, notwithstanding of all this,

   they sinned still the more;

   And though he had great wonders wrought,

   believ'd him not therefore:


   ^33Wherefore their days in vanity

   he did consume and waste;

   And by his wrath their wretched years

   away in trouble past.


   ^34But when he slew them, then they did

   to seek him shew desire;

   Yea, they return'd, and after God

   right early did enquire.


   ^35And that the Lord had been their Rock,

   they did remember then;

   Ev'n that the high almighty God

   had their Redeemer been.


   ^36Yet with their mouth they flatter'd him,

   and spake but feignedly;

   And they unto the God of truth

   with their false tongues did lie.


   ^37For though their words were good, their heart

   with him was not sincere;

   Unstedfast and perfidious

   they in his cov'nant were.


   ^38But, full of pity, he forgave

   their sin, them did not slay;

   Nor stirr'd up all his wrath, but oft

   his anger turn'd away.


   ^39For that they were but fading flesh

   to mind he did recall;

   A wind that passeth soon away,

   and not returns at all.


   ^40How often did they him provoke

   within the wilderness!

   And in the desert did him grieve

   with their rebelliousness!


   ^41Yea, turning back, they tempted God,

   and limits set upon

   Him, who in midst of Isr'el is

   the only Holy One.


   ^42They did not call to mind his pow'r,

   nor yet the day when he

   Deliver'd them out of the hand

   of their fierce enemy;


   ^43Nor how great signs in Egypt land

   he openly had wrought;

   What miracles in Zoan's field

   his hand to pass had brought.


   ^44How lakes and rivers ev'ry where

   he turned into blood;

   So that nor man nor beast could drink

   of standing lake or flood.


   ^45He brought among them swarms of flies,

   which did them sore annoy;

   And divers kinds of filthy frogs

   he sent them to destroy.


   ^46He to the caterpillar gave

   the fruits of all their soil;

   Their labours he deliver'd up

   unto the locusts' spoil.


   ^47Their vines with hail, their sycamores

   he with the frost did blast:

   ^48Their beasts to hail he gave; their flocks

   hot thunderbolts did waste.


   ^49Fierce burning wrath he on them cast,

   and indignation strong,

   And troubles sore, by sending forth

   ill angels them among.


   ^50He to his wrath made way; their soul

   from death he did not save;

   But over to the pestilence

   the lives of them he gave.


   ^51In Egypt land the first-born all

   he smote down ev'ry where;

   Among the tents of Ham, ev'n these

   chief of their strength that were.


   ^52But his own people, like to sheep,

   thence to go forth he made;

   And he, amidst the wilderness,

   them, as a flock, did lead.


   ^53And he them safely on did lead,

   so that they did not fear;

   Whereas their en'mies by the sea

   quite overwhelmed were.


   ^54To borders of his sanctuary

   the Lord his people led,

   Ev'n to the mount which his right hand

   for them had purchased.


   ^55The nations of Canaan,

   by his almighty hand,

   Before their face he did expel

   out of their native land;


   Which for inheritance to them

   by line he did divide,

   And made the tribes of Israel

   within their tents abide.


   ^56Yet God most high they did provoke,

   and tempted ever still;

   And to observe his testimonies

   did not incline their will:


   ^57But, like their fathers, turned back,

   and dealt unfaithfully:

   Aside they turned, like a bow

   that shoots deceitfully.


   ^58For they to anger did provoke

   him with their places high;

   And with their graven images

   mov'd him to jealousy.


   ^59When God heard this, he waxed wroth,

   and much loath'd Isr'el then:

   ^60So Shiloh's tent he left, the tent

   which he had plac'd with men.


   ^61And he his strength delivered

   into captivity;

   He left his glory in the hand

   of his proud enemy.


   ^62His people also he gave o'er

   unto the sword's fierce rage:

   So sore his wrath inflamed was

   against his heritage.


   ^63The fire consum'd their choice young men;

   their maids no marriage had;

   ^64And when their priests fell by the sword,

   their wives no mourning made.


   ^65But then the Lord arose, as one

   that doth from sleep awake;

   And like a giant that, by wine

   refresh'd, a shout doth make:


   ^66Upon his en'mies' hinder parts

   he made his stroke to fall;

   And so upon them he did put

   a shame perpetual.


   ^67Moreover, he the tabernacle

   of Joseph did refuse;

   The mighty tribe of Ephraim

   he would in no wise chuse:


   ^68But he did chuse Jehudah's tribe

   to be the rest above;

   And of mount Sion he made choice,

   which he so much did love.


   ^69And he his sanctuary built

   like to a palace high,

   Like to the earth which he did found

   to perpetuity.


   ^70Of David, that his servant was,

   he also choice did make,

   And even from the folds of sheep

   was pleased him to take:


   ^71From waiting on the ewes with young,

   he brought him forth to feed

   Israel, his inheritance,

   his people, Jacob's seed.


   ^72So after the integrity

   he of his heart them fed;

   And by the good skill of his hands

   them wisely governed.

Psalm 79

   A Psalm of Asaph.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O God, the heathen enter'd have

   thine heritage; by them

   Defiled is thy house: on heaps

   they laid Jerusalem.


   ^2The bodies of thy servants they

   have cast forth to be meat

   To rav'nous fowls; thy dear saints' flesh

   they gave to beasts to eat.


   ^3Their blood about Jerusalem

   like water they have shed;

   And there was none to bury them

   when they were slain and dead.


   ^4Unto our neighbours a reproach

   most base become are we;

   A scorn and laughingstock to them

   that round about us be.


   ^5How long, Lord, shall thine anger last?

   wilt thou still keep the same?

   And shall thy fervent jealousy

   burn like unto a flame?


   ^6On heathen pour thy fury forth,

   that have thee never known,

   And on those kingdoms which thy name

   have never call'd upon.


   ^7For these are they who Jacob have

   devoured cruelly;

   And they his habitation

   have caused waste to lie.


   ^8Against us mind not former sins;

   thy tender mercies show;

   Let them prevent us speedily,

   for we're brought very low.


   ^9For thy name's glory help us, Lord,

   who hast our Saviour been:

   Deliver us; for thy name's sake,

   O purge away our sin.


   ^10Why say the heathen, Where's their God?

   let him to them be known;

   When those who shed thy servants' blood

   are in our sight o'erthrown.


   ^11O let the pris'ner's sighs ascend

   before thy sight on high;

   Preserve those in thy mighty pow'r

   that are design'd to die.


   ^12And to our neighbours' bosom cause

   it sev'n-fold render'd be,

   Ev'n the reproach wherewith they have,

   O Lord, reproached thee.


   ^13So we thy folk, and pasture-sheep,

   shall give thee thanks always;

   And unto generations all

   we will shew forth thy praise.

Psalm 80

   To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, Eduth, A Psalm of Asaph.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Hear, Isr'el's Shepherd! like a flock

   thou that dost Joseph guide;

   Shine forth, O thou that dost between

   the cherubims abide.


   ^2In Ephraim's, and Benjamin's

   and in Manasseh's sight,

   O come for our salvation;

   stir up thy strength and might.


   ^3Turn us again, O Lord our God,

   and upon us vouchsafe

   To make thy countenance to shine,

   and so we shall be safe.


   ^4O Lord of hosts, almighty God,

   how long shall kindled be

   Thy wrath against the prayer made

   by thine own folk to thee?


   ^5Thou tears of sorrow giv'st to them

   instead of bread to eat;

   Yea, tears instead of drink thou giv'st

   to them in measure great.


   ^6Thou makest us a strife unto

   our neighbours round about;

   Our enemies among themselves

   at us do laugh and flout.


   ^7Turn us again, O God of hosts,

   and upon us vouchsafe

   To make thy countenance to shine,

   and so we shall be safe.


   ^8A vine from Egypt brought thou hast,

   by thine outstretched hand;

   And thou the heathen out didst cast,

   to plant it in their land.


   ^9Before it thou a room didst make,

   where it might grow and stand;

   Thou causedst it deep root to take,

   and it did fill the land.


   ^10The mountains vail'd were with its shade,

   as with a covering;

   Like goodly cedars were the boughs

   which out from it did spring.


   ^11Upon the one hand to the sea

   her boughs she did out send;

   On th' other side unto the flood

   her branches did extend.


   ^12Why hast thou then thus broken down,

   and ta'en her hedge away?

   So that all passengers do pluck,

   and make of her a prey.


   ^13The boar who from the forest comes

   doth waste it at his pleasure;

   The wild beast of the field also

   devours it out of measure.


   ^14O God of hosts, we thee beseech,

   return now unto thine;

   Look down from heav'n in love, behold,

   and visit this thy vine:


   ^15This vineyard, which thine own right hand

   hath planted us among;

   And that same branch, which for thyself

   thou hast made to be strong.


   ^16Burnt up it is with flaming fire,

   it also is cut down:

   They utterly are perished,

   when as thy face doth frown.


   ^17O let thy hand be still upon

   the Man of thy right hand,

   The Son of man, whom for thyself

   thou madest strong to stand.


   ^18So henceforth we will not go back,

   nor turn from thee at all:

   O do thou quicken us, and we

   upon thy name will call.


   ^19Turn us again, Lord God of hosts,

   and upon us vouchsafe

   To make thy countenance to shine,

   and so we shall be safe.

Psalm 81

   To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of Asaph.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Sing loud to God our strength; with joy

   to Jacob's God do sing.

   ^2Take up a psalm, the pleasant harp,

   timbrel and psalt'ry bring.


   ^3Blow trumpets at new-moon, what day

   our feast appointed is:

   ^4For charge to Isr'el, and a law

   of Jacob's God was this.


   ^5To Joseph this a testimony

   he made, when Egypt land

   He travell'd through, where speech I heard

   I did not understand.


   ^6His shoulder I from burdens took,

   his hands from pots did free.

   ^7Thou didst in trouble on me call,

   and I deliver'd thee:


   In secret place of thundering

   I did thee answer make;

   And at the streams of Meribah

   of thee a proof did take.


   ^8O thou, my people, give an ear,

   I'll testify to thee;

   To thee, O Isr'el, if thou wilt

   but hearken unto me.


   ^9In midst of thee there shall not be

   any strange god at all;

   Nor unto any god unknown

   thou bowing down shalt fall.


   ^10I am the Lord thy God, which did

   from Egypt land thee guide;

   I'll fill thy mouth abundantly,

   do thou it open wide.


   ^11But yet my people to my voice

   would not attentive be;

   And ev'n my chosen Israel

   he would have none of me.


   ^12So to the lust of their own hearts

   I them delivered;

   And then in counsels of their own

   they vainly wandered.


   ^13O that my people had me heard,

   Isr'el my ways had chose!

   ^14I had their en'mies soon subdu'd,

   my hand turn'd on their foes.


   ^15The haters of the Lord to him

   submission should have feign'd;

   But as for them, their time should have

   for evermore remain'd.


   ^16He should have also fed them with

   the finest of the wheat;

   Of honey from the rock thy fill

   I should have made thee eat.

   ^1In gods' assembly God doth stand;

   ^2How long, accepting persons vile,

   will ye give judgment wrong?


   ^3Defend the poor and fatherless;

   to poor oppress'd do right.

   ^4The poor and needy ones set free;

   rid them from ill men's might.


   ^5They know not, nor will understand;

   in darkness they walk on:

   All the foundations of the earth

   out of their course are gone.


   ^6I said that ye are gods, and are

   sons of the Highest all:

   ^7But ye shall die like men, and as

   one of the princes fall.


   ^8O God, do thou raise up thyself,

   the earth to judgment call:

   For thou, as thine inheritance,

   shalt take the nations all.

   ^1Keep not, O God, we thee entreat,

   O keep not silence now:

   Do thou not hold thy peace, O God,

   and still no more be thou.


   ^2For, lo, thine enemies a noise

   tumultuously have made;

   And they that haters are of thee

   have lifted up the head.


   ^3Against thy chosen people they

   do crafty counsel take;

   And they against thy hidden ones

   do consultations make.


   ^4Come, let us cut them off, said they,

   from being a nation,

   That of the name of Isr'el may

   no more be mention.


   ^5For with joint heart they plot, in league

   against thee they combine.

   ^6The tents of Edom, Ishm'elites,

   Moab's and Hagar's line;


   ^7Gebal, and Ammon, Amalek,

   Philistines, those of Tyre;

   ^8And Assur join'd with them, to help

   Lot's children they conspire.


   ^9Do to them as to Midian,

   Jabin at Kison strand;

   ^10And Sis'ra, which at En-dor fell,

   as dung to fat the land.


   ^11Like Oreb and like Zeeb make

   their noble men to fall;

   Like Zeba and Zalmunna like,

   make thou their princes all;


   ^12Who said, For our possession

   let us God's houses take.

   ^13My God, them like a wheel, as chaff

   before the wind, them make.


   ^14As fire consumes the wood, as flame

   doth mountains set on fire,

   ^15Chase and affright them with the storm

   and tempest of thine ire.


   ^16Their faces fill with shame, O Lord,

   that they may seek thy name.

   ^17Let them confounded be, and vex'd,

   and perish in their shame:


   ^18That men may know that thou, to whom

   alone doth appertain

   The name Jehovah, dost most high

   o'er all the earth remain.

Psalm 84

   ^1How lovely is thy dwelling-place,

   O Lord of hosts, to me!

   The tabernacles of thy grace

   how pleasant, Lord, they be!


   ^2My thirsty soul longs veh'mently,

   yea faints, thy courts to see:

   My very heart and flesh cry out,

   O living God, for thee.


   ^3Behold, the sparrow findeth out

   an house wherein to rest;

   The swallow also for herself

   hath purchased a nest;


   Ev'n thine own altars,* where she safe

   her young ones forth may bring,

   O thou almighty Lord of hosts,

   who art my God and King.


   ^4Bless'd are they in thy house that dwell,

   they ever give thee praise.

   ^5Bless'd is the man whose strength thou art,

   in whose heart are thy ways:


   ^6Who passing thorough Baca's vale,

   therein do dig up wells;

   Also the rain that falleth down

   the pools with water fills.


   ^7So they from strength unwearied go

   still forward unto strength,

   Until in Sion they appear

   before the Lord at length.


   ^8Lord God of hosts, my prayer hear;

   O Jacob's God, give ear.

   ^9See God our shield, look on the face

   of thine anointed dear.


   ^10For in thy courts one day excels

   a thousand; rather in

   My God's house will I keep a door,

   than dwell in tents of sin.


   ^11For God the Lord's a sun and shield:

   he'll grace and glory give;

   And will withhold no good from them

   that uprightly do live.


   ^12O thou that art the Lord of hosts,

   that man is truly blest,

   Who by assured confidence

   on thee alone doth rest.

   Jacob's captivity thou hast

   recall'd with mighty hand.


   ^2Thou pardoned thy people hast

   all their iniquities;

   Thou all their trespasses and sins

   hast cover'd from thine eyes.


   ^3Thou took'st off all thine ire, and turn'dst

   from thy wrath's furiousness.

   ^4Turn us, God of our health, and cause

   thy wrath gainst us to cease.


   ^5Shall thy displeasure thus endure

   against us without end?

   Wilt thou to generations all

   thine anger forth extend?


   ^6That in thee may thy people joy,

   wilt thou not us revive?

   ^7Shew us thy mercy, Lord, to us

   do thy salvation give.


   ^8I'll hear what God the Lord will speak:

   to his folk he'll speak peace,

   And to his saints; but let them not

   return to foolishness.


   ^9To them that fear him surely near

   is his salvation;

   That glory in our land may have

   her habitation.


   ^10Truth met with mercy, righteousness

   and peace kiss'd mutually:

   ^11Truth springs from earth, and righteousness

   looks down from heaven high.

   our land shall yield increase:

   ^13Justice, to set us in his steps,

   shall go before his face.

Psalm 86

   A Prayer of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord, do thou bow down thine ear,

   and hear me graciously;

   Because I sore afflicted am,

   and am in poverty.


   ^2Because I'm holy, let my soul

   by thee preserved be:

   O thou my God, thy servant save,

   that puts his trust in thee.


   ^3Sith unto thee I daily cry,

   be merciful to me.

   ^4Rejoice thy servant's soul; for, Lord,

   I lift my soul to thee.


   ^5For thou art gracious, O Lord,

   and ready to forgive;

   And rich in mercy, all that call

   upon thee to relieve.


   ^6Hear, Lord, my pray'r; unto the voice

   of my request attend:

   ^7In troublous times I'll call on thee;

   for thou wilt answer send.


   ^8Lord, there is none among the gods

   that may with thee compare;

   And like the works which thou hast done,

   not any work is there.


   ^9All nations whom thou mad'st shall come

   and worship rev'rently

   Before thy face; and they, O Lord,

   thy name shall glorify.


   ^10Because thou art exceeding great,

   and works by thee are done

   Which are to be admir'd; and thou

   art God thyself alone.


   ^11Teach me thy way, and in thy truth,

   O Lord, then walk will I;

   Unite my heart, that I thy name

   may fear continually.


   ^12O Lord my God, with all my heart

   to thee I will give praise;

   And I the glory will ascribe

   unto thy name always:


   ^13Because thy mercy toward me

   in greatness doth excel;

   And thou deliver'd hast my soul

   out from the lowest hell.


   ^14O God, the proud against me rise,

   and vi'lent men have met,

   That for my soul have sought; and thee

   before them have not set.


   ^15But thou art full of pity, Lord,

   a God most gracious,

   Long-suffering, and in thy truth

   and mercy plenteous.


   ^16O turn to me thy countenance,

   and mercy on me have;

   Thy servant strengthen, and the son

   of thine own handmaid save.


   ^17Shew me a sign for good, that they

   which do me hate may see,

   And be asham'd; because thou, Lord,

   didst help and comfort me.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord God, my Saviour, day and night

   before thee cry'd have I.

   ^2Before thee let my prayer come;

   give ear unto my cry.


   ^3For troubles great do fill my soul;

   my life draws nigh the grave.

   ^4I'm counted with those that go down

   to pit, and no strength have.


   ^5Ev'n free among the dead, like them

   that slain in grave do lie;

   Cut off from thy hand, whom no more

   thou hast in memory.


   ^6Thou hast me laid in lowest pit,

   in deeps and darksome caves.

   ^7Thy wrath lies hard on me, thou hast

   me press'd with all thy waves.


   ^8Thou hast put far from me my friends,

   thou mad'st them to abhor me;

   And I am so shut up, that I

   find no evasion for me.


   ^9By reason of affliction

   mine eye mourns dolefully:

   To thee, Lord, do I call, and stretch

   my hands continually.


   ^10Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?

   shall they rise, and thee bless?

   ^11Shall in the grave thy love be told?

   in death thy faithfulness?


   ^12Shall thy great wonders in the dark,

   or shall thy righteousness

   Be known to any in the land

   of deep forgetfulness?


   ^13But, Lord, to thee I cry'd; my pray'r

   at morn prevent shall thee.

   ^14Why, Lord, dost thou cast off my soul,

   and hid'st thy face from me?


   ^15Distress'd am I, and from my youth

   I ready am to die;

   Thy terrors I have borne, and am

   distracted fearfully.


   ^16The dreadful fierceness of thy wrath

   quite over me doth go:

   Thy terrors great have cut me off,

   they did pursue me so.


   ^17For round about me ev'ry day,

   like water, they did roll;

   And, gathering together, they

   have compassed my soul.


   ^18My friends thou hast put far from me,

   and him that did me love;

   And those that mine acquaintance were

   to darkness didst remove.

Psalm 89

   Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1God's mercies I will ever sing;

   and with my mouth I shall

   Thy faithfulness make to be known

   to generations all.


   ^2For mercy shall be built, said I,

   for ever to endure;

   Thy faithfulness, ev'n in the heav'ns,

   thou wilt establish sure.


   ^3I with my chosen One have made

   a cov'nant graciously;

   And to my servant, whom I lov'd,

   to David sworn have I;


   ^4That I thy seed establish shall

   for ever to remain,

   And will to generations all

   thy throne build and maintain.


   ^5The praises of thy wonders, Lord,

   the heavens shall express;

   And in the congregation

   of saints thy faithfulness.


   ^6For who in heaven with the Lord

   may once himself compare?

   Who is like God among the sons

   of those that mighty are?


   ^7Great fear in meeting of the saints

   is due unto the Lord;

   And he of all about him should

   with rev'rence be ador'd.


   ^8O thou that art the Lord of hosts,

   what Lord in mightiness

   Is like to thee? who compass'd round

   art with thy faithfulness.


   ^9Ev'n in the raging of the sea

   thou over it dost reign;

   And when the waves thereof do swell,

   thou stillest them again.


   ^10Rahab in pieces thou didst break,

   like one that slaughter'd is;

   And with thy mighty arm thou hast

   dispers'd thine enemies.


   ^11The heav'ns are thine, thou for thine own

   the earth dost also take;

   The world, and fulness of the same,

   thy pow'r did found and make.


   ^12The north and south from thee alone

   their first beginning had;

   Both Tabor mount and Hermon hill

   shall in thy name be glad.


   ^13Thou hast an arm that's full of pow'r,

   thy hand is great in might;

   And thy right hand exceedingly

   exalted is in height.


   ^14Justice and judgment of thy throne

   are made the dwelling-place;

   Mercy, accompany'd with truth,

   shall go before thy face.


   ^15O greatly bless'd the people are

   the joyful sound that know;

   In brightness of thy face, O Lord,

   they ever on shall go.


   ^16They in thy name shall all the day

   rejoice exceedingly;

   And in thy righteousness shall they

   exalted be on high.


   ^17Because the glory of their strength

   doth only stand in thee;

   And in thy favour shall our horn

   and pow'r exalted be.


   ^18For God is our defence; and he

   to us doth safety bring:

   The Holy One of Israel

   is our almighty King.


   ^19In vision to thy Holy One

   thou saidst, I help upon

   A strong one laid; out of the folk

   I rais'd a chosen one;


   ^20Ev'n David, I have found him out

   a servant unto me;

   And with my holy oil my King

   anointed him to be.


   ^21With whom my hand shall stablish'd be;

   mine arm shall make him strong.

   ^22On him the foe shall not exact,

   nor son of mischief wrong.


   ^23I will beat down before his face

   all his malicious foes;

   I will them greatly plague who do

   with hatred him oppose.


   ^24My mercy and my faithfulness

   with him yet still shall be;

   And in my name his horn and pow'r

   men shall exalted see.


   ^25His hand and pow'r shall reach afar;

   I'll set it in the sea;

   And his right hand established

   shall in the rivers be.


   ^26Thou art my Father, he shall cry,

   thou art my God alone;

   And he shall say, Thou art the Rock

   of my salvation.


   ^27I'll make him my first-born, more high

   than kings of any land.

   ^28My love I'll ever keep for him,

   my cov'nant fast shall stand.


   ^29His seed I by my pow'r will make

   for ever to endure;

   And, as the days of heav'n, his throne

   shall stable be, and sure.


   ^30But if his children shall forsake

   my laws, and go astray,

   And in my judgments shall not walk,

   but wander from my way:


   ^31If they my laws break, and do not

   keep my commandements;

   ^32I'll visit then their faults with rods,

   their sins with chastisements.


   ^33Yet I'll not take my love from him,

   nor false my promise make.

   ^34My cov'nant I'll not break, nor change

   what with my mouth I spake.


   ^35Once by my holiness I sware,

   to David I'll not lie;

   ^36His seed and throne shall, as the sun,

   before me last for aye.


   ^37It, like the moon, shall ever be

   establish'd stedfastly;

   And like to that which in the heav'n

   doth witness faithfully.


   ^38But thou, displeased, hast cast off,

   thou didst abhor and loathe;

   With him that thine anointed is

   thou hast been very wroth.


   ^39Thou hast thy servant's covenant

   made void, and quite cast by;

   Thou hast profan'd his crown, while it

   cast on the ground doth lie.


   ^40Thou all his hedges hast broke down,

   his strong holds down hast torn.

   ^41He to all passers-by a spoil,

   to neighbours is a scorn.


   ^42Thou hast set up his foes' right hand;

   mad'st all his en'mies glad:

   ^43Turn'd his sword's edge, and him to stand

   in battle hast not made.


   ^44His glory thou hast made to cease,

   his throne to ground down cast;

   ^45Shorten'd his days of youth, and him

   with shame thou cover'd hast.


   ^46How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thyself?

   for ever, in thine ire?

   And shall thine indignation

   burn like unto a fire?


   ^47Remember, Lord, how short a time

   I shall on earth remain:

   O wherefore is it so that thou

   has made all men in vain?


   ^48What man is he that liveth here,

   and death shall never see?

   Or from the power of the grave

   what man his soul shall free?


   ^49Thy former loving-kindnesses,

   O Lord, where be they now?

   Those which in truth and faithfulness

   to David sworn hast thou?


   ^50Mind, Lord, thy servant's sad reproach;

   how I in bosom bear

   The scornings of the people all,

   who strong and mighty are.


   ^51Wherewith thy raging enemies

   reproach'd, O Lord, think on;

   Wherewith they have reproach'd the steps

   of thine anointed one.


   ^52All blessing to the Lord our God

   let be ascribed then:

   For evermore so let it be.

   Amen, yea, and amen.

Psalm 90

   A Prayer of Moses the man of God.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place

   in generations all.

   ^2Before thou ever hadst brought forth

   the mountains great or small;


   Ere ever thou hadst form'd the earth,

   and all the world abroad;

   Ev'n thou from everlasting art

   to everlasting God.


   ^3Thou dost unto destruction

   man that is mortal turn;

   And unto them thou say'st, Again,

   ye sons of men, return.


   ^4Because a thousand years appear

   no more before thy sight

   Than yesterday, when it is past,

   or than a watch by night.


   ^5As with an overflowing flood

   thou carry'st them away:

   They like a sleep are, like the grass

   that grows at morn are they.


   ^6At morn it flourishes and grows,

   cut down at ev'n doth fade.

   ^7For by thine anger we're consum'd,

   thy wrath makes us afraid.


   ^8Our sins thou and iniquities

   dost in thy presence place,

   And sett'st our secret faults before

   the brightness of thy face.


   ^9For in thine anger all our days

   do pass on to an end;

   And as a tale that hath been told,

   so we our years do spend.


   ^10Threescore and ten years do sum up

   our days and years, we see;

   Or, if, by reason of more strength,

   in some fourscore they be:


   Yet doth the strength of such old men

   but grief and labour prove;

   For it is soon cut off, and we

   fly hence, and soon remove.


   ^11Who knows the power of thy wrath?

   according to thy fear

   ^12So is thy wrath: Lord, teach thou us

   our end in mind to bear;


   And so to count our days, that we

   our hearts may still apply

   To learn thy wisdom and thy truth,

   that we may live thereby.


   ^13Turn yet again to us, O Lord,

   how long thus shall it be?

   Let it repent thee now for those

   that servants are to thee.


   ^14O with thy tender mercies, Lord,

   us early satisfy;

   So we rejoice shall all our days,

   and still be glad in thee.


   ^15According as the days have been,

   wherein we grief have had,

   And years wherein we ill have seen,

   so do thou make us glad.


   ^16O let thy work and pow'r appear

   thy servants' face before;

   And shew unto their children dear

   thy glory evermore:


   ^17And let the beauty of the Lord

   our God be us upon:

   Our handy-works establish thou,

   establish them each one.

Psalm 91

   8,6,8,6


   ^1He that doth in the secret place

   of the most High reside,

   Under the shade of him that is

   th' Almighty shall abide.


   ^2I of the Lord my God will say,

   He is my refuge still,

   He is my fortress, and my God,

   and in him trust I will.


   ^3Assuredly he shall thee save,

   and give deliverance

   From subtile fowler's snare, and from

   the noisome pestilence.


   ^4His feathers shall thee hide; thy trust

   under his wings shall be:

   His faithfulness shall be a shield

   and buckler unto thee.


   ^5Thou shalt not need to be afraid

   for terrors of the night;

   Nor for the arrow that doth fly

   by day, while it is light;


   ^6Nor for the pestilence, that walks

   in darkness secretly;

   Nor for destruction, that doth waste

   at noon-day openly.


   ^7A thousand at thy side shall fall,

   on thy right hand shall lie

   Ten thousand dead; yet unto thee

   it shall not once come nigh.


   ^8Only thou with thine eyes shalt look,

   and a beholder be;

   And thou therein the just reward

   of wicked men shalt see.


   ^9Because the Lord, who constantly

   my refuge is alone,

   Ev'n the most High, is made by thee

   thy habitation;


   ^10No plague shall near thy dwelling come;

   no ill shall thee befall:

   ^11For thee to keep in all thy ways

   his angels charge he shall.


   ^12They in their hands shall bear thee up,

   still waiting thee upon;

   Lest thou at any time should'st dash

   thy foot against a stone.


   ^13Upon the adder thou shalt tread,

   and on the lion strong;

   Thy feet on dragons trample shall,

   and on the lions young.


   ^14Because on me he set his love,

   I'll save and set him free;

   Because my great name he hath known,

   I will him set on high.


   ^15He'll call on me, I'll answer him;

   I will be with him still

   In trouble, to deliver him,

   and honour him I will.


   ^16With length of days unto his mind

   I will him satisfy;

   I also my salvation

   will cause his eyes to see.

Psalm 92

   A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1To render thanks unto the Lord

   it is a comely thing,

   And to thy name, O thou most High,

   due praise aloud to sing.


   ^2Thy loving-kindness to shew forth

   when shines the morning light;

   And to declare thy faithfulness

   with pleasure ev'ry night.


   ^3On a ten-stringed instrument,

   upon the psaltery,

   And on the harp with solemn sound,

   and grave sweet melody.


   ^4For thou, Lord, by thy mighty works

   hast made my heart right glad;

   And I will triumph in the works

   which by thine hands were made.


   ^5How great, Lord, are thy works! each thought

   of thine a deep it is:

   ^6A brutish man it knoweth not;

   fools understand not this.


   ^7When those that lewd and wicked are

   spring quickly up like grass,

   And workers of iniquity

   do flourish all apace;


   It is that they for ever may

   destroyed be and slain;

   ^8But thou, O Lord, art the most High,

   for ever to remain.


   ^9For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord,

   thine en'mies perish shall;

   The workers of iniquity

   shall be dispersed all.


   ^10But thou shalt, like unto the horn

   of th' unicorn, exalt

   My horn on high: thou with fresh oil

   anoint me also shalt.


   ^11Mine eyes shall also my desire

   see on mine enemies;

   Mine ears shall of the wicked hear

   that do against me rise.


   ^12But like the palm-tree flourishing

   shall be the righteous one;

   He shall like to the cedar grow

   that is in Lebanon.


   ^13Those that within the house of God

   are planted by his grace,

   They shall grow up, and flourish all

   in our God's holy place.


   ^14And in old age, when others fade,

   they fruit still forth shall bring;

   They shall be fat, and full of sap,

   and aye be flourishing;


   ^15To shew that upright is the Lord:

   he is a rock to me;

   And he from all unrighteousness

   is altogether free.

Psalm 93

   8,6,8,6


   ^1The Lord doth reign, and cloth'd is he

   with majesty most bright;

   His works do shew him cloth'd to be,

   and girt about with might.


   The world is also stablished,

   that it cannot depart.

   ^2Thy throne is fix'd of old, and thou

   from everlasting art.


   ^3The floods, O Lord, have lifted up,

   they lifted up their voice;

   The floods have lifted up their waves,

   and made a mighty noise.


   ^4But yet the Lord, that is on high,

   is more of might by far

   Than noise of many waters is,

   or great sea-billows are.


   ^5Thy testimonies ev'ry one

   in faithfulness excel;

   And holiness for ever, Lord,

   thine house becometh well.

Psalm 94

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord God, unto whom alone

   all vengeance doth belong;

   O mighty God, who vengeance own'st,

   shine forth, avenging wrong.


   ^2Lift up thyself, thou of the earth

   the sov'reign Judge that art;

   And unto those that are so proud

   a due reward impart.


   ^3How long, O mighty God, shall they

   who lewd and wicked be,

   How long shall they who wicked are

   thus triumph haughtily?


   ^4How long shall things most hard by them

   be uttered and told?

   And all that work iniquity

   to boast themselves be bold?


   ^5Thy folk they break in pieces, Lord,

   thine heritage oppress:

   ^6The widow they and stranger slay,

   and kill the fatherless.


   ^7Yet say they, God it shall not see,

   nor God of Jacob know.

   ^8Ye brutish people! understand;

   fools! when wise will ye grow?


   ^9The Lord did plant the ear of man,

   and hear then shall not he?

   He only form'd the eye, and then

   shall he not clearly see?


   ^10He that the nations doth correct,

   shall he not chastise you?

   He knowledge unto man doth teach,

   and shall himself not know?


   ^11Man's thoughts to be but vanity

   the Lord doth well discern.

   ^12Bless'd is the man thou chast'nest, Lord,

   and mak'st thy law to learn:


   ^13That thou may'st give him rest from days

   of sad adversity,

   Until the pit be digg'd for those

   that work iniquity.


   ^14For sure the Lord will not cast off

   those that his people be,

   Neither his own inheritance

   quit and forsake will he:


   ^15But judgment unto righteousness

   shall yet return again;

   And all shall follow after it

   that are right-hearted men.


   ^16Who will rise up for me against

   those that do wickedly?

   Who will stand up for me gainst those

   that work iniquity?


   ^17Unless the Lord had been my help

   when I was sore opprest,

   Almost my soul had in the house

   of silence been at rest.


   ^18When I had uttered this word,

   (my foot doth slip away,)

   Thy mercy held me up, O Lord,

   thy goodness did me stay.


   ^19Amidst the multitude of thoughts

   which in my heart do fight,

   My soul, lest it be overcharg'd,

   thy comforts do delight.


   ^20Shall of iniquity the throne

   have fellowship with thee,

   Which mischief, cunningly contriv'd,

   doth by a law decree?


   ^21Against the righteous souls they join,

   they guiltless blood condemn.

   ^22But of my refuge God's the rock,

   and my defence from them.


   ^23On them their own iniquity

   the Lord shall bring and lay,

   And cut them off in their own sin;

   our Lord God shall them slay.

Psalm 95

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O come, let us sing to the Lord:

   come, let us ev'ry one

   A joyful noise make to the Rock

   of our salvation.


   ^2Let us before his presence come

   with praise and thankful voice;

   Let us sing psalms to him with grace,

   and make a joyful noise.


   ^3For God, a great God, and great King,

   above all gods he is.

   ^4Depths of the earth are in his hand,

   the strength of hills is his.


   ^5To him the spacious sea belongs,

   for he the same did make;

   The dry land also from his hands

   its form at first did take.


   ^6O come, and let us worship him,

   let us bow down withal,

   And on our knees before the Lord

   our Maker let us fall.


   ^7For he's our God, the people we

   of his own pasture are,

   And of his hand the sheep; to-day,

   if ye his voice will hear,


   ^8Then harden not your hearts, as in

   the provocation,

   As in the desert, on the day

   of the tentation:


   ^9When me your fathers tempt'd and prov'd,

   and did my working see;

   ^10Ev'n for the space of forty years

   this race hath grieved me.


   I said, This people errs in heart,

   my ways they do not know:

   ^11To whom I sware in wrath, that to

   my rest they should not go.

Psalm 96

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O sing a new song to the Lord:

   sing all the earth to God.

   ^2To God sing, bless his name, shew still

   his saving health abroad.


   ^3Among the heathen nations

   his glory do declare;

   And unto all the people shew

   his works that wondrous are.


   ^4For great's the Lord, and greatly he

   is to be magnify'd;

   Yea, worthy to be fear'd is he

   above all gods beside.


   ^5For all the gods are idols dumb,

   which blinded nations fear;

   But our God is the Lord, by whom

   the heav'ns created were.


   ^6Great honour is before his face,

   and majesty divine;

   Strength is within his holy place,

   and there doth beauty shine.


   ^7Do ye ascribe unto the Lord,

   of people ev'ry tribe,

   Glory do ye unto the Lord,

   and mighty pow'r ascribe.


   ^8Give ye the glory to the Lord

   that to his name is due;

   Come ye into his courts, and bring

   an offering with you.


   ^9In beauty of his holiness,

   O do the Lord adore;

   Likewise let all the earth throughout

   tremble his face before.


   ^10Among the heathen say, God reigns;

   the world shall stedfastly

   Be fix'd from moving; he shall judge

   the people righteously.


   ^11Let heav'ns be glad before the Lord,

   and let the earth rejoice;

   Let seas, and all that is therein,

   cry out, and make a noise.


   ^12Let fields rejoice, and ev'ry thing

   that springeth of the earth:

   Then woods and ev'ry tree shall sing

   with gladness and with mirth


   ^13Before the Lord; because he comes,

   to judge the earth comes he:

   He'll judge the world with righteousness,

   the people faithfully.

Psalm 97

   8,6,8,6


   ^1God reigneth, let the earth be glad,

   and isles rejoice each one.

   ^2Dark clouds him compass; and in right

   with judgment dwells his throne.


   ^3Fire goes before him, and his foes

   it burns up round about:

   ^4His lightnings lighten did the world;

   earth saw, and shook throughout.


   ^5Hills at the presence of the Lord,

   like wax, did melt away;

   Ev'n at the presence of the Lord

   of all the earth, I say.


   ^6The heav'ns declare his righteousness,

   all men his glory see.

   ^7All who serve graven images,

   confounded let them be.


   Who do of idols boast themselves,

   let shame upon them fall:

   Ye that are called gods, see that

   ye do him worship all.


   ^8Sion did hear, and joyful was,

   glad Judah's daughters were;

   They much rejoic'd, O Lord, because

   thy judgments did appear.


   ^9For thou, O Lord, art high above

   all things on earth that are;

   Above all other gods thou art

   exalted very far.


   ^10Hate ill, all ye that love the Lord:

   his saints' souls keepeth he;

   And from the hands of wicked men

   he sets them safe and free.


   ^11For all those that be righteous

   sown is a joyful light,

   And gladness sown is for all those

   that are in heart upright.


   ^12Ye righteous, in the Lord rejoice;

   express your thankfulness,

   When ye into your memory

   do call his holiness.

   to judge the earth comes he:

   He'll judge the world with righteousness,

   his folk with equity.

Psalm 99

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Th' eternal Lord doth reign as king,

   let all the people quake;

   He sits between the cherubims,

   let th' earth be mov'd and shake.


   ^2The Lord in Sion great and high

   above all people is;

   ^3Thy great and dreadful name (for it

   is holy) let them bless.


   ^4The king's strength also judgment loves;

   thou settlest equity:

   Just judgment thou dost execute

   in Jacob righteously.


   ^5The Lord our God exalt on high,

   and rev'rently do ye

   Before his footstool worship him:

   the Holy One is he.


   ^6Moses and Aaron mong his priests,

   Samuel, with them that call

   Upon his name: these call'd on God,

   and he them answer'd all.


   ^7Within the pillar of the cloud

   he unto them did speak:

   The testimonies he them taught,

   and laws, they did not break.


   ^8Thou answer'dst them, O Lord our God;

   thou wast a God that gave

   Pardon to them, though on their deeds

   thou wouldest vengeance have.


   ^9Do ye exalt the Lord our God,

   and at his holy hill

   Do ye him worship: for the Lord

   our God is holy still.

Psalm 100

   A Psalm of praise.

First Version (L.M.)

   8,8,8,8


   ^1All people that on earth do dwell,

   Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.

   ^2Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell,

   Come ye before him and rejoice.


   ^3Know that the Lord is God indeed;

   Without our aid he did us make:

   We are his flock, he doth us feed,

   And for his sheep he doth us take.


   ^4O enter then his gates with praise,

   Approach with joy his courts unto:

   Praise, laud, and bless his name always,

   For it is seemly so to do.


   ^5For why? the Lord our God is good,

   His mercy is for ever sure;

   His truth at all times firmly stood,

   And shall from age to age endure.

Psalm 100

Second Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O all ye lands, unto the Lord

   make ye a joyful noise.

   ^2Serve God with gladness, him before

   come with a singing voice.


   ^3Know ye the Lord that he is God;

   not we, but he us made:

   We are his people, and the sheep

   within his pasture fed.


   ^4Enter his gates and courts with praise,

   to thank him go ye thither:

   To him express your thankfulness,

   and bless his name together.


   ^5Because the Lord our God is good,

   his mercy faileth never;

   And to all generations

   his truth endureth ever.

Psalm 101

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1I mercy will and judgment sing,

   Lord, I will sing to thee.

   ^2With wisdom in a perfect way

   shall my behaviour be.


   O when, in kindness unto me,

   wilt thou be pleas'd to come?

   I with a perfect heart will walk

   within my house at home.


   ^3I will endure no wicked thing

   before mine eyes to be:

   I hate their work that turn aside,

   it shall not cleave to me.


   ^4A stubborn and a froward heart

   depart quite from me shall;

   A person giv'n to wickedness

   I will not know at all.


   ^5I'll cut him off that slandereth

   his neighbour privily:

   The haughty heart I will not bear,

   nor him that looketh high.


   ^6Upon the faithful of the land

   mine eyes shall be, that they

   May dwell with me: he shall me serve

   that walks in perfect way.


   ^7Who of deceit a worker is

   in my house shall not dwell;

   And in my presence shall he not

   remain that lies doth tell.


   ^8Yea, all the wicked of the land

   early destroy will I;

   All from God's city to cut off

   that work iniquity.

Psalm 102

   A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his
   complaint before the Lord.

First Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord, unto my pray'r give ear,

   my cry let come to thee;

   ^2And in the day of my distress

   hide not thy face from me.


   Give ear to me; what time I call,

   to answer me make haste:

   ^3For, as an hearth, my bones are burnt,

   my days, like smoke, do waste.


   ^4My heart within me smitten is,

   and it is withered

   Like very grass; so that I do

   forget to eat my bread.


   ^5By reason of my groaning voice

   my bones cleave to my skin.

   ^6Like pelican in wilderness

   forsaken I have been:


   I like an owl in desert am,

   that nightly there doth moan;

   ^7I watch, and like a sparrow am

   on the house-top alone.


   ^8My bitter en'mies all the day

   reproaches cast on me;

   And, being mad at me, with rage

   against me sworn they be.


   ^9For why? I ashes eaten have

   like bread, in sorrows deep;

   My drink I also mingled have

   with tears that I did weep.


   ^10Thy wrath and indignation

   did cause this grief and pain;

   For thou hast lift me up on high,

   and cast me down again.


   ^11My days are like unto a shade,

   which doth declining pass;

   And I am dry'd and withered,

   ev'n like unto the grass.


   ^12But thou, Lord, everlasting art,

   and thy remembrance shall

   Continually endure, and be

   to generations all.


   ^13Thou shalt arise, and mercy have

   upon thy Sion yet;

   The time to favour her is come,

   the time that thou hast set.


   ^14For in her rubbish and her stones

   thy servants pleasure take;

   Yea, they the very dust thereof

   do favour for her sake.


   ^15So shall the heathen people fear

   the Lord's most holy name;

   And all the kings on earth shall dread

   thy glory and thy fame.


   ^16When Sion by the mighty Lord

   built up again shall be,

   In glory then and majesty

   to men appear shall he.


   ^17The prayer of the destitute

   he surely will regard;

   Their prayer will he not despise,

   by him it shall be heard.


   ^18For generations yet to come

   this shall be on record:

   So shall the people that shall be

   created praise the Lord.


   ^19He from his sanctuary's height

   hath downward cast his eye;

   And from his glorious throne in heav'n

   the Lord the earth did spy;


   ^20That of the mournful prisoner

   the groanings he might hear,

   To set them free that unto death

   by men appointed are:


   ^21That they in Sion may declare

   the Lord's most holy name,

   And publish in Jerusalem

   the praises of the same;


   ^22When as the people gather shall

   in troops with one accord,

   When kingdoms shall assembled be

   to serve the highest Lord.


   ^23My wonted strength and force he hath

   abated in the way,

   And he my days hath shortened:

   ^24Thus therefore did I say,


   My God, in mid-time of my days

   take thou me not away:

   From age to age eternally

   thy years endure and stay.


   ^25The firm foundation of the earth

   of old time thou hast laid;

   The heavens also are the work

   which thine own hands have made.


   ^26Thou shalt for evermore endure,

   but they shall perish all;

   Yea, ev'ry one of them wax old,

   like to a garment, shall:


   Thou, as a vesture, shalt them change,

   and they shall changed be:

   ^27But thou the same art, and thy years

   are to eternity.


   ^28The children of thy servants shall

   continually endure;

   And in thy sight, O Lord, their seed

   shall be establish'd sure.

Psalm 102

Second Version (L.M.)

   8,8,8,8


   ^1Lord, hear my pray'r, and let my cry

   Have speedy access unto thee;

   ^2In day of my calamity

   O hide not thou thy face from me.


   Hear when I call to thee; that day

   An answer speedily return:

   ^3My days, like smoke, consume away,

   And, as an hearth, my bones do burn.


   ^4My heart is wounded very sore,

   And withered, like grass doth fade:

   I am forgetful grown therefore

   To take and eat my daily bread.


   ^5By reason of my smart within,

   And voice of my most grievous groans,

   My flesh consumed is, my skin,

   All parch'd, doth cleave unto my bones.


   ^6The pelican of wilderness,

   The owl in desert, I do match;

   ^7And, sparrow-like, companionless,

   Upon the house's top, I watch.


   ^8I all day long am made a scorn,

   Reproach'd by my malicious foes:

   The madmen are against me sworn,

   The men against me that arose.


   ^9For I have ashes eaten up,

   To me as if they had been bread;

   And with my drink I in my cup

   Of bitter tears a mixture made.


   ^10Because thy wrath was not appeas'd,

   And dreadful indignation:

   Therefore it was that thou me rais'd,

   And thou again didst cast me down.


   ^11My days are like a shade alway,

   Which doth declining swiftly pass;

   And I am withered away,

   Much like unto the fading grass.


   ^12But thou, O Lord, shalt still endure,

   From change and all mutation free,

   And to all generations sure

   Shall thy remembrance ever be.


   ^13Thou shalt arise, and mercy yet

   Thou to mount Sion shalt extend:

   Her time for favour which was set,

   Behold, is now come to an end.


   ^14Thy saints take pleasure in her stones,

   Her very dust to them is dear.

   ^15All heathen lands and kingly thrones

   On earth thy glorious name shall fear.


   ^16God in his glory shall appear,

   When Sion he builds and repairs.

   ^17He shall regard and lend his ear

   Unto the needy's humble pray'rs:


   Th' afflicted's pray'r he will not scorn.

   ^18All times this shall be on record:

   And generations yet unborn

   Shall praise and magnify the Lord.


   ^19He from his holy place look'd down,

   The earth he view'd from heav'n on high;

   ^20To hear the pris'ner's mourning groan,

   And free them that are doom'd to die;


   ^21That Sion, and Jerus'lem too,

   His name and praise may well record,

   ^22When people and the kingdoms do

   Assemble all to praise the Lord.


   ^23My strength he weaken'd in the way,

   My days of life he shortened.

   ^24My God, O take me not away

   In mid-time of my days, I said:


   Thy years throughout all ages last.

   ^25Of old thou hast established

   The earth's foundation firm and fast:

   Thy mighty hands the heav'ns have made.


   ^26They perish shall, as garments do,

   But thou shalt evermore endure;

   As vestures, thou shalt change them so;

   And they shall all be changed sure:


   ^27But from all changes thou art free;

   Thy endless years do last for aye.

   ^28Thy servants, and their seed who be,

   Establish'd shall before thee stay.

Psalm 103

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O thou my soul, bless God the Lord;

   and all that in me is

   Be stirred up his holy name

   to magnify and bless.


   ^2Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God,

   and not forgetful be

   Of all his gracious benefits

   he hath bestow'd on thee.


   ^3All thine iniquities who doth

   most graciously forgive:

   Who thy diseases all and pains

   doth heal, and thee relieve.


   ^4Who doth redeem thy life, that thou

   to death may'st not go down;

   Who thee with loving-kindness doth

   and tender mercies crown:


   ^5Who with abundance of good things

   doth satisfy thy mouth;

   So that, ev'n as the eagle's age,

   renewed is thy youth.


   ^6God righteous judgment executes

   for all oppressed ones.

   ^7His ways to Moses, he his acts

   made known to Isr'el's sons.


   ^8The Lord our God is merciful,

   and he is gracious,

   Long-suffering, and slow to wrath,

   in mercy plenteous.


   ^9He will not chide continually,

   nor keep his anger still.

   ^10With us he dealt not as we sinn'd,

   nor did requite our ill.


   ^11For as the heaven in its height

   the earth surmounteth far;

   So great to those that do him fear

   his tender mercies are:


   ^12As far as east is distant from

   the west, so far hath he

   From us removed, in his love,

   all our iniquity.


   ^13Such pity as a father hath

   unto his children dear;

   Like pity shews the Lord to such

   as worship him in fear.


   ^14For he remembers we are dust,

   and he our frame well knows.

   ^15Frail man, his days are like the grass,

   as flow'r in field he grows:


   ^16For over it the wind doth pass,

   and it away is gone;

   And of the place where once it was

   it shall no more be known.


   ^17But unto them that do him fear

   God's mercy never ends;

   And to their children's children still

   his righteousness extends:


   ^18To such as keep his covenant,

   and mindful are alway

   Of his most just commandements,

   that they may them obey.


   ^19The Lord prepared hath his throne

   in heavens firm to stand;

   And ev'ry thing that being hath

   his kingdom doth command.


   ^20O ye his angels, that excel

   in strength, bless ye the Lord;

   Ye who obey what he commands,

   and hearken to his word.


   ^21O bless and magnify the Lord,

   ye glorious hosts of his;

   Ye ministers, that do fulfil

   whate'er his pleasure is.


   ^22O bless the Lord, all ye his works,

   wherewith the world is stor'd

   In his dominions ev'ry where.

   My soul, bless thou the Lord.

Psalm 104

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Bless God, my soul. O Lord my God,

   thou art exceeding great;

   With honour and with majesty

   thou clothed art in state.


   ^2With light, as with a robe, thyself

   thou coverest about;

   And, like unto a curtain, thou

   the heavens stretchest out.


   ^3Who of his chambers doth the beams

   within the waters lay;

   Who doth the clouds his chariot make,

   on wings of wind make way.


   ^4Who flaming fire his ministers,

   his angels sp'rits, doth make:

   ^5Who earth's foundations did lay,

   that it should never shake.


   ^6Thou didst it cover with the deep,

   as with a garment spread:

   The waters stood above the hills,

   when thou the word but said.


   ^7But at the voice of thy rebuke

   they fled, and would not stay;

   They at thy thunder's dreadful voice

   did haste them fast away.


   ^8They by the mountains do ascend,

   and by the valley-ground

   Descend, unto that very place

   which thou for them didst found.


   ^9Thou hast a bound unto them set,

   that they may not pass over,

   That they do not return again

   the face of earth to cover.


   ^10He to the valleys sends the springs,

   which run among the hills:

   ^11They to all beasts of field give drink,

   wild asses drink their fills.


   ^12By them the fowls of heav'n shall have

   their habitation,

   Which do among the branches sing

   with delectation.


   ^13He from his chambers watereth

   the hills, when they are dry'd:

   With fruit and increase of thy works

   the earth is satisfy'd.


   ^14For cattle he makes grass to grow,

   he makes the herb to spring

   For th' use of man, that food to him

   he from the earth may bring;


   ^15And wine, that to the heart of man

   doth cheerfulness impart,

   Oil that his face makes shine, and bread

   that strengtheneth his heart.


   ^16The trees of God are full of sap;

   the cedars that do stand

   In Lebanon, which planted were

   by his almighty hand.


   ^17Birds of the air upon their boughs

   do chuse their nests to make;

   As for the stork, the fir-tree she

   doth for her dwelling take.


   ^18The lofty mountains for wild goats

   a place of refuge be;

   The conies also to the rocks

   do for their safety flee.


   ^19He sets the moon in heav'n, thereby

   the seasons to discern:

   From him the sun his certain time

   of going down doth learn.


   ^20Thou darkness mak'st, tis night, then beasts

   of forests creep abroad.

   ^21The lions young roar for their prey,

   and seek their meat from God.


   ^22The sun doth rise, and home they flock,

   down in their dens they lie.

   ^23Man goes to work, his labour he

   doth to the ev'ning ply.


   ^24How manifold, Lord, are thy works!

   in wisdom wonderful

   Thou ev'ry one of them hast made;

   earth's of thy riches full:


   ^25So is this great and spacious sea,

   wherein things creeping are,

   Which number'd cannot be; and beasts

   both great and small are there.


   ^26There ships go; there thou mak'st to play

   that leviathan great.

   ^27These all wait on thee, that thou may'st

   in due time give them meat.


   ^28That which thou givest unto them

   they gather for their food;

   Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally,

   they filled are with good.


   ^29Thou hid'st thy face; they troubled are,

   their breath thou tak'st away;

   Then do they die, and to their dust

   return again do they.


   ^30Thy quick'ning spirit thou send'st forth,

   then they created be;

   And then the earth's decayed face

   renewed is by thee.


   ^31The glory of the mighty Lord

   continue shall for ever:

   The Lord Jehovah shall rejoice

   in all his works together.


   ^32Earth, as affrighted, trembleth all,

   if he on it but look;

   And if the mountains he but touch,

   they presently do smoke.


   ^33I will sing to the Lord most high,

   so long as I shall live;

   And while I being have I shall

   to my God praises give.


   ^34Of him my meditation shall

   sweet thoughts to me afford;

   And as for me, I will rejoice

   in God, my only Lord.


   ^35From earth let sinners be consum'd,

   let ill men no more be.

   O thou my soul, bless thou the Lord.

   Praise to the Lord give ye.

Psalm 105

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Give thanks to God, call on his name;

   to men his deeds make known.

   ^2Sing ye to him, sing psalms; proclaim

   his wondrous works each one.


   ^3See that ye in his holy name

   to glory do accord;

   And let the heart of ev'ry one

   rejoice that seeks the Lord.


   ^4The Lord Almighty, and his strength,

   with stedfast hearts seek ye:

   His blessed and his gracious face

   seek ye continually.


   ^5Think on the works that he hath done,

   which admiration breed;

   His wonders, and the judgments all

   which from his mouth proceed;


   ^6O ye that are of Abr'ham's race,

   his servant well approv'n;

   And ye that Jacob's children are,

   whom he chose for his own.


   ^7Because he, and he only, is

   the mighty Lord our God;

   And his most righteous judgments are

   in all the earth abroad.


   ^8His cov'nant he remember'd hath,

   that it may ever stand:

   To thousand generations

   the word he did command.


   ^9Which covenant he firmly made

   with faithful Abraham,

   And unto Isaac, by his oath,

   he did renew the same:


   ^10And unto Jacob, for a law,

   he made it firm and sure,

   A covenant to Israel,

   which ever should endure.


   ^11He said, I'll give Canaan's land

   for heritage to you;

   ^12While they were strangers there, and few,

   in number very few:


   ^13While yet they went from land to land

   without a sure abode;

   And while through sundry kingdoms they

   did wander far abroad;


   ^14Yet, notwithstanding suffer'd he

   no man to do them wrong:

   Yea, for their sakes, he did reprove

   kings, who were great and strong.


   ^15Thus did he say, Touch ye not those

   that mine anointed be,

   Nor do the prophets any harm

   that do pertain to me.


   ^16He call'd for famine on the land,

   he brake the staff of bread:

   ^17But yet he sent a man before,

   by whom they should be fed;


   Ev'n Joseph, whom unnat'rally

   sell for a slave did they;

   ^18Whose feet with fetters they did hurt,

   and he in irons lay;


   ^19Until the time that his word came

   to give him liberty;

   The word and purpose of the Lord

   did him in prison try.


   ^20Then sent the king, and did command

   that he enlarg'd should be:

   He that the people's ruler was

   did send to set him free.


   ^21A lord to rule his family

   he rais'd him, as most fit;

   To him of all that he possess'd

   he did the charge commit:


   ^22That he might at his pleasure bind

   the princes of the land;

   And he might teach his senators

   wisdom to understand.


   ^23The people then of Israel

   down into Egypt came;

   And Jacob also sojourned

   within the land of Ham.


   ^24And he did greatly by his pow'r

   increase his people there;

   And stronger than their enemies

   they by his blessing were.


   ^25Their heart he turned to envy

   his folk maliciously,

   With those that his own servants were

   to deal in subtilty.


   ^26His servant Moses he did send,

   Aaron his chosen one.

   ^27By these his signs and wonders great

   in Ham's land were made known.


   ^28Darkness he sent, and made it dark;

   his word they did obey.

   ^29He turn'd their waters into blood,

   and he their fish did slay.


   ^30The land in plenty brought forth frogs

   in chambers of their kings.

   ^31His word all sorts of flies and lice

   in all their borders brings.


   ^32He hail for rain, and flaming fire

   into their land he sent:

   ^33And he their vines and fig-trees smote:

   trees of their coasts he rent.


   ^34He spake, and caterpillars came,

   locusts did much abound;

   ^35Which in their land all herbs consum'd,

   and all fruits of their ground.


   ^36He smote all first-born in their land,

   chief of their strength each one.

   ^37With gold and silver brought them forth,

   weak in their tribes were none.


   ^38Egypt was glad when forth they went,

   their fear on them did light.

   ^39He spread a cloud for covering,

   and fire to shine by night.


   ^40They ask'd, and he brought quails: with bread

   of heav'n he filled them.

   ^41He open'd rocks, floods gush'd, and ran

   in deserts like a stream.


   ^42For on his holy promise he,

   and servant Abr'ham, thought.

   ^43With joy his people, his elect

   with gladness, forth he brought.


   ^44And unto them the pleasant lands

   he of the heathen gave;

   That of the people's labour they

   inheritance might have.


   ^45That they his statutes might observe

   according to his word;

   And that they might his laws obey.

   Give praise unto the Lord.

Psalm 106

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Give praise and thanks unto the Lord,

   for bountiful is he;

   His tender mercy doth endure

   unto eternity.


   ^2God's mighty works who can express?

   or shew forth all his praise?

   ^3Blessed are they that judgment keep,

   and justly do always.


   ^4Remember me, Lord, with that love

   which thou to thine dost bear;

   With thy salvation, O my God,

   to visit me draw near:


   ^5That I thy chosen's good may see,

   and in their joy rejoice;

   And may with thine inheritance

   triumph with cheerful voice.


   ^6We with our fathers sinned have,

   and of iniquity

   Too long we have the workers been;

   we have done wickedly.


   ^7The wonders great, which thou, O Lord,

   didst work in Egypt land,

   Our fathers, though they saw, yet them

   they did not understand:


   And they thy mercies' multitude

   kept not in memory;

   But at the sea, ev'n the Red sea,

   provok'd him grievously.


   ^8Nevertheless he saved them,

   ev'n for his own name's sake;

   That so he might to be well known

   his mighty power make.


   ^9When he the Red sea did rebuke,

   then dried up it was:

   Through depths, as through the wilderness,

   he safely made them pass.


   ^10From hands of those that hated them

   he did his people save;

   And from the en'my's cruel hand

   to them redemption gave.


   ^11The waters overwhelm'd their foes;

   not one was left alive.

   ^12Then they believ'd his word, and praise

   to him in songs did give.


   ^13But soon did they his mighty works

   forget unthankfully,

   And on his counsel and his will

   did not wait patiently;


   ^14But much did lust in wilderness,

   and God in desert tempt.

   ^15He gave them what they sought, but to

   their soul he leanness sent.


   ^16And against Moses in the camp

   their envy did appear;

   At Aaron they, the saint of God,

   envious also were.


   ^17Therefore the earth did open wide,

   and Dathan did devour,

   And all Abiram's company

   did cover in that hour.


   ^18Likewise among their company

   a fire was kindled then;

   And so the hot consuming flame

   burnt up these wicked men.


   ^19Upon the hill of Horeb they

   an idol-calf did frame,

   A molten image they did make,

   and worshipped the same.


   ^20And thus their glory, and their God,

   most vainly changed they

   Into the likeness of an ox

   that eateth grass or hay.


   ^21They did forget the mighty God,

   that had their saviour been,

   By whom such great things brought to pass

   they had in Egypt seen.


   ^22In Ham's land he did wondrous works,

   things terrible did he,

   When he his mighty hand and arm

   stretch'd out at the Red sea.


   ^23Then said he, He would them destroy,

   had not, his wrath to stay,

   His chosen Moses stood in breach,

   that them he should not slay.


   ^24Yea, they despis'd the pleasant land,

   believed not his word:

   ^25But in their tents they murmured,

   not heark'ning to the Lord.


   ^26Therefore in desert them to slay

   he lifted up his hand:

   ^27'Mong nations to o'erthrow their seed,

   and scatter in each land.


   ^28They unto Baal-peor did

   themselves associate;

   The sacrifices of the dead

   they did profanely eat.


   ^29Thus, by their lewd inventions,

   they did provoke his ire;

   And then upon them suddenly

   the plague brake in as fire.


   ^30Then Phin'has rose, and justice did,

   and so the plague did cease;

   ^31That to all ages counted was

   to him for righteousness.


   ^32And at the waters, where they strove,

   they did him angry make,

   In such sort, that it fared ill

   with Moses for their sake:


   ^33Because they there his spirit meek

   provoked bitterly,

   So that he utter'd with his lips

   words unadvisedly.


   ^34Nor, as the Lord commanded them,

   did they the nations slay:

   ^35But with the heathen mingled were,

   and learn'd of them their way.


   ^36And they their idols serv'd, which did

   a snare unto them turn.

   ^37Their sons and daughters they to dev'ls

   in sacrifice did burn.


   ^38In their own children's guiltless blood

   their hands they did imbrue,

   Whom to Canaan's idols they

   for sacrifices slew:


   So was the land defil'd with blood.

   ^39They stain'd with their own way,

   And with their own inventions

   a whoring they did stray.


   ^40Against his people kindled was

   the wrath of God therefore,

   Insomuch that he did his own

   inheritance abhor.


   ^41He gave them to the heathen's hand;

   their foes did them command.

   ^42Their en'mies them oppress'd, they were

   made subject to their hand.


   ^43He many times deliver'd them;

   but with their counsel so

   They him provok'd, that for their sin

   they were brought very low.


   ^44Yet their affliction he beheld,

   when he did hear their cry:

   ^45And he for them his covenant

   did call to memory;


   After his mercies' multitude

   ^46he did repent: And made

   Them to be pity'd of all those

   who did them captive lead.


   ^47O Lord our God, us save, and gather

   the heathen from among,

   That we thy holy name may praise

   in a triumphant song.


   ^48Bless'd be Jehovah, Isr'el's God,

   to all eternity:

   Let all the people say, Amen.

   Praise to the Lord give ye.

Psalm 107

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Praise God, for he is good: for still

   his mercies lasting be.

   ^2Let God's redeem'd say so, whom he

   from th' en'my's hand did free;


   ^3And gather'd them out of the lands,

   from north, south, east, and west.

   ^4They stray'd in desert's pathless way,

   no city found to rest.


   ^5For thirst and hunger in them faints

   ^6their soul. When straits them press,

   They cry unto the Lord, and he

   them frees from their distress.


   ^7Them also in a way to walk

   that right is he did guide,

   That they might to a city go,

   wherein they might abide.


   ^8O that men to the Lord would give

   praise for his goodness then,

   And for his works of wonder done

   unto the sons of men!


   ^9For he the soul that longing is

   doth fully satisfy;

   With goodness he the hungry soul

   doth fill abundantly.


   ^10Such as shut up in darkness deep,

   and in death's shade abide,

   Whom strongly hath affliction bound,

   and irons fast have ty'd:


   ^11Because against the words of God

   they wrought rebelliously,

   And they the counsel did contemn

   of him that is most High:


   ^12Their heart he did bring down with grief,

   they fell, no help could have.

   ^13In trouble then they cry'd to God,

   he them from straits did save.


   ^14He out of darkness did them bring,

   and from death's shade them take;

   These bands, wherewith they had been bound,

   asunder quite he brake.


   ^15O that men to the Lord would give

   praise for his goodness then,

   And for his works of wonder done

   unto the sons of men!


   ^16Because the mighty gates of brass

   in pieces he did tear,

   By him in sunder also cut

   the bars of iron were.


   ^17Fools, for their sin, and their offence,

   do sore affliction bear;

   ^18All kind of meat their soul abhors;

   they to death's gates draw near.


   ^19In grief they cry to God; he saves

   them from their miseries.

   ^20He sends his word, them heals, and them

   from their destructions frees.


   ^21O that men to the Lord would give

   praise for his goodness then,

   And for his works of wonder done

   unto the sons of men!


   ^22And let them sacrifice to him

   off rings of thankfulness;

   And let them shew abroad his works

   in songs of joyfulness.


   ^23Who go to sea in ships, and in

   great waters trading be,

   ^24Within the deep these men God's works

   and his great wonders see.


   ^25For he commands, and forth in haste

   the stormy tempest flies,

   Which makes the sea with rolling waves

   aloft to swell and rise.


   ^26They mount to heav'n, then to the depths

   they do go down again;

   Their soul doth faint and melt away

   with trouble and with pain.


   ^27They reel and stagger like one drunk,

   at their wit's end they be:

   ^28Then they to God in trouble cry,

   who them from straits doth free.


   ^29The storm is chang'd into a calm

   at his command and will;

   So that the waves, which rag'd before,

   now quiet are and still.


   ^30Then are they glad, because at rest

   and quiet now they be:

   So to the haven he them brings,

   which they desir'd to see.


   ^31O that men to the Lord would give

   praise for his goodness then,

   And for his works of wonder done

   unto the sons of men!


   ^32Among the people gathered

   let them exalt his name;

   Among assembled elders spread

   his most renowned fame.


   ^33He to dry land turns water-springs,

   and floods to wilderness;

   ^34For sins of those that dwell therein,

   fat land to barrenness.


   ^35The burnt and parched wilderness

   to water-pools he brings;

   The ground that was dry'd up before

   he turns to water-springs:


   ^36And there, for dwelling, he a place

   doth to the hungry give,

   That they a city may prepare

   commodiously to live.


   ^37There sow they fields, and vineyards plant,

   to yield fruits of increase.

   ^38His blessing makes them multiply,

   lets not their beasts decrease.


   ^39Again they are diminished,

   and very low brought down,

   Through sorrow and affliction,

   and great oppression.


   ^40He upon princes pours contempt,

   and causeth them to stray,

   And wander in a wilderness,

   wherein there is no way.


   ^41Yet setteth he the poor on high

   from all his miseries,

   And he, much like unto a flock,

   doth make him families.


   ^42They that are righteous shall rejoice,

   when they the same shall see;

   And, as ashamed, stop her mouth

   shall all iniquity.


   ^43Whoso is wise, and will these things

   observe, and them record,

   Ev'n they shall understand the love

   and kindness of the Lord.

Psalm 108

   A Song or Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1My heart is fix'd, Lord; I will sing,

   and with my glory praise.

   ^2Awake up psaltery and harp;

   myself I'll early raise.


   ^3I'll praise thee mong the people, Lord;

   'mong nations sing will I:

   ^4For above heav'n thy mercy's great,

   thy truth doth reach the sky.


   ^5Be thou above the heavens, Lord,

   exalted gloriously;

   Thy glory all the earth above

   be lifted up on high.


   ^6That those who thy beloved are

   delivered may be,

   O do thou save with thy right hand,

   and answer give to me.


   ^7God in his holiness hath said,

   Herein I will take pleasure;

   Shechem I will divide, and forth

   will Succoth's valley measure.


   ^8Gilead I claim as mine by right;

   Manasseh mine shall be;

   Ephraim is of my head the strength;

   Judah gives laws for me;


   ^9Moab's my washing-pot; my shoe

   I'll over Edom throw;

   Over the land of Palestine

   I will in triumph go.


   ^10O who is he will bring me to

   the city fortify'd?

   O who is he that to the land

   of Edom will me guide?


   ^11O God, thou who hadst cast us off,

   this thing wilt thou not do?

   And wilt not thou, ev'n thou, O God,

   forth with our armies go?


   ^12Do thou from trouble give us help,

   for helpless is man's aid.

   ^13Through God we shall do valiantly;

   our foes he shall down tread.

Psalm 109

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O thou the God of all my praise,

   do thou not hold thy peace;

   ^2For mouths of wicked men to speak

   against me do not cease:


   The mouths of vile deceitful men

   against me open'd be;

   And with a false and lying tongue

   they have accused me.


   ^3They did beset me round about

   with words of hateful spight:

   And though to them no cause I gave,

   against me they did fight.


   ^4They for my love became my foes,

   but I me set to pray.

   ^5Evil for good, hatred for love,

   to me they did repay.


   ^6Set thou the wicked over him;

   and upon his right hand

   Give thou his greatest enemy,

   ev'n Satan, leave to stand.


   ^7And when by thee he shall be judg'd,

   let him condemned be;

   And let his pray'r be turn'd to sin,

   when he shall call on thee.


   ^8Few be his days, and in his room

   his charge another take.

   ^9His children let be fatherless,

   his wife a widow make.


   ^10His children let be vagabonds,

   and beg continually;

   And from their places desolate

   seek bread for their supply.


   ^11Let covetous extortioners

   catch all he hath away:

   Of all for which he labour'd hath

   let strangers make a prey.


   ^12Let there be none to pity him,

   let there be none at all

   That on his children fatherless

   will let his mercy fall.


   ^13Let his posterity from earth

   cut off for ever be,

   And in the foll'wing age their name

   be blotted out by thee.


   ^14Let God his father's wickedness

   still to remembrance call;

   And never let his mother's sin

   be blotted out at all.


   ^15But let them all before the Lord

   appear continually,

   That he may wholly from the earth

   cut off their memory.


   ^16Because he mercy minded not,

   but persecuted still

   The poor and needy, that he might

   the broken-hearted kill.


   ^17As he in cursing pleasure took,

   so let it to him fall;

   As he delighted not to bless,

   so bless him not at all.


   ^18As cursing he like clothes put on,

   into his bowels so,

   Like water, and into his bones,

   like oil, down let it go.


   ^19Like to the garment let it be

   which doth himself array,

   And for a girdle, wherewith he

   is girt about alway.


   ^20From God let this be their reward

   that en'mies are to me,

   And their reward that speak against

   my soul maliciously.


   ^21But do thou, for thine own name's sake,

   O God the Lord, for me:

   Sith good and sweet thy mercy is,

   from trouble set me free.


   ^22For I am poor and indigent,

   afflicted sore am I,

   My heart within me also is

   wounded exceedingly.


   ^23I pass like a declining shade,

   am like the locust tost:

   ^24My knees through fasting weaken'd are,

   my flesh hath fatness lost.


   ^25I also am a vile reproach

   unto them made to be;

   And they that did upon me look

   did shake their heads at me.


   ^26O do thou help and succour me,

   who art my God and Lord:

   And, for thy tender mercy's sake,

   safety to me afford:


   ^27That thereby they may know that this

   is thy almighty hand;

   And that thou, Lord, hast done the same,

   they may well understand.


   ^28Although they curse with spite, yet, Lord,

   bless thou with loving voice:

   Let them asham'd be when they rise;

   thy servant let rejoice.


   ^29Let thou mine adversaries all

   with shame be clothed over;

   And let their own confusion

   them, as a mantle, cover.


   ^30But as for me, I with my mouth

   will greatly praise the Lord;

   And I among the multitude

   his praises will record.


   ^31For he shall stand at his right hand

   who is in poverty,

   To save him from all those that would

   condemn his soul to die.

Psalm 110

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1The Lord did say unto my Lord,

   Sit thou at my right hand,

   Until I make thy foes a stool,

   whereon thy feet may stand.


   ^2The Lord shall out of Sion send

   the rod of thy great pow'r:

   In midst of all thine enemies

   be thou the governor.


   ^3A willing people in thy day

   of pow'r shall come to thee,

   In holy beauties from morn's womb;

   thy youth like dew shall be.


   ^4The Lord himself hath made an oath,

   and will repent him never,

   Of th' order of Melchisedec

   thou art a priest for ever.


   ^5The glorious and mighty Lord,

   that sits at thy right hand,

   Shall, in his day of wrath, strike through

   kings that do him withstand.


   ^6He shall among the heathen judge,

   he shall with bodies dead

   The places fill: o'er many lands

   he wound shall ev'ry head.


   ^7The brook that runneth in the way

   with drink shall him supply;

   And, for this cause, in triumph he

   shall lift his head on high.

   ^2The whole works of the Lord our God

   Sought out they are of ev'ry one

   that doth therein take pleasure.


   ^3His work most honourable is,

   most glorious and pure,

   And his untainted righteousness

   for ever doth endure.


   ^4His works most wonderful he hath

   made to be thought upon:

   The Lord is gracious, and he is

   full of compassion.


   ^5He giveth meat unto all those

   that truly do him fear;

   And evermore his covenant

   he in his mind will bear.


   ^6He did the power of his works

   unto his people show,

   When he the heathen's heritage

   upon them did bestow.


   ^7His handy-works are truth and right;

   all his commands are sure:

   ^8And, done in truth and uprightness,

   they evermore endure.


   ^9He sent redemption to his folk;

   his covenant for aye

   He did command: holy his name

   and rev'rend is alway.


   ^10Wisdom's beginning is God's fear:

   good understanding they

   Have all that his commands fulfill:

   his praise endures for aye.

   shall be the earth upon:

   ^5A good man doth his favour shew,

   and doth to others lend:

   He with discretion his affairs

   will guide unto the end.


   ^6Surely there is not any thing

   that ever shall him move:

   The righteous man's memorial

   shall everlasting prove.


   ^7When he shall evil tidings hear,

   he shall not be afraid:

   His heart is fix'd, his confidence

   upon the Lord is stay'd.


   ^8His heart is firmly stablished,

   afraid he shall not be,

   Until upon his enemies

   he his desire shall see.


   ^9He hath dispers'd, giv'n to the poor;

   his righteousness shall be

   To ages all; with honour shall

   his horn be raised high.

   who made the earth and heav'n.

   ^16The heav'n, ev'n heav'ns, are God's, but he

   earth to men's sons hath giv'n.

   ^3Of death the cords and sorrows did

   about me compass round;

   I grief and trouble found.


   ^4Upon the name of God the Lord

   Deliver thou my soul, O Lord,

   ^8For my distressed soul from death

   deliver'd was by thee:

   Thou didst my mourning eyes from tears,

   my feet from falling, free.


   ^9I in the land of those that live

   will walk the Lord before.

   ^10I did believe, therefore I spake:

   I was afflicted sore.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O praise the Lord, for he is good;

   his mercy lasteth ever.

   ^2Let those of Israel now say,

   His mercy faileth never.


   ^3Now let the house of Aaron say,

   His mercy lasteth ever.

   ^4Let those that fear the Lord now say,

   His mercy faileth never.


   ^5I in distress call'd on the Lord;

   the Lord did answer me:

   He in a large place did me set,

   from trouble made me free.


   ^6The mighty Lord is on my side,

   I will not be afraid;

   For any thing that man can do

   I shall not be dismay'd.


   ^7The Lord doth take my part with them

   that help to succour me:

   Therefore on those that do me hate

   I my desire shall see.


   ^8Better it is to trust in God

   than trust in man's defence;

   ^9Better to trust in God than make

   princes our confidence.


   ^10The nations, joining all in one,

   did compass me about:

   But in the Lord's most holy name

   I shall them all root out.


   ^11They compass'd me about; I say,

   they compass'd me about:

   But in the Lord's most holy name

   I shall them all root out.


   ^12Like bees they compass'd me about;

   like unto thorns that flame

   They quenched are: for them shall I

   destroy in God's own name.


   ^13Thou sore hast thrust, that I might fall,

   but my Lord helped me.

   ^14God my salvation is become,

   my strength and song is he.


   ^15In dwellings of the righteous

   is heard the melody

   Of joy and health: the Lord's right hand

   doth ever valiantly.


   ^16The right hand of the mighty Lord

   exalted is on high;

   The right hand of the mighty Lord

   doth ever valiantly.


   ^17I shall not die, but live, and shall

   the works of God discover.

   ^18The Lord hath me chastised sore,

   but not to death giv'n over.


   ^19O set ye open unto me

   the gates of righteousness;

   Then will I enter into them,

   and I the Lord will bless.


   ^20This is the gate of God, by it

   the just shall enter in.

   ^21Thee will I praise, for thou me heard'st

   and hast my safety been.


   ^22That stone is made head corner-stone,

   which builders did despise:

   ^23This is the doing of the Lord,

   and wondrous in our eyes.


   ^24This is the day God made, in it

   we'll joy triumphantly.

   ^25Save now, I pray thee, Lord; I pray,

   send now prosperity.


   ^26Blessed is he in God's great name

   that cometh us to save:

   We, from the house which to the Lord

   pertains, you blessed have.


   ^27God is the Lord, who unto us

   hath made light to arise:

   Bind ye unto the altar's horns

   with cords the sacrifice.


   ^28Thou art my God, I'll thee exalt;

   my God, I will thee praise.

   ^29Give thanks to God, for he is good:

   his mercy lasts always.

   his statutes are inclin'd;

   with their whole heart and mind.


   ^3Such in his ways do walk, and they

   do no iniquity.

   ^4Thou hast commanded us to keep

   thy precepts carefully.


   ^5O that thy statutes to observe

   thee will I praise and bless,

   When I the judgments all have learn'd

   with all my soul and heart:

   O let me not from the right path

   of thy commands depart.


   ^11Thy word I in my heart have hid,

   ^12O Lord, thou ever blessed art,

   thy statutes teach thou me.


   ^13The judgments of thy mouth each one

   ^21Thou hast rebuk'd the cursed proud,

   ^22Reproach and shame remove from me,

   ^1In my distress to God I cry'd,

   and he gave ear to me.

   ^2From lying lips, and guileful tongue,

   O Lord, my soul set free.


   ^3What shall be giv'n thee? or what shall

   be done to thee, false tongue?

   ^4Ev'n burning coals of juniper,

   sharp arrows of the strong.


   ^5Woe's me that I in Mesech am

   a sojourner so long;

   That I in tabernacles dwell

   to Kedar that belong.


   ^6My soul with him that hateth peace

   hath long a dweller been.

   ^7I am for peace; but when I speak,

   for battle they are keen.

   ^2My safety cometh from the Lord,

   who heav'n and earth hath made.


   ^3Thy foot he'll not let slide, nor will

   ^4Behold, he that keeps Israel,

   ^5The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade

   ^6The moon by night thee shall not smite,

   ^7The Lord shall keep thy soul; he shall

   ^1I joy'd when to the house of God,

   Go up, they said to me.

   ^2Jerusalem, within thy gates

   ^3Jerus'lem, as a city, is

   To Isr'el's testimony, there

   to God's name thanks to pay.

   ^5For thrones of judgment, ev'n the thrones

   of David's house, there stay.


   ^6Pray that Jerusalem may have

   ^7Therefore I wish that peace may still

   within thy walls remain,

   And ever may thy palaces

   prosperity retain.


   ^8Now, for my friends' and brethren's sakes,

   As handmaid's eyes her mistress' hand;

   so do our eyes attend

   Upon the Lord our God, until

   ^3O Lord, be gracious to us,

   unto us gracious be;

   ^4Our soul is fill'd with scorn of those

   that at their ease abide,

Psalm 124

First Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Had not the Lord been on our side,

   may Israel now say;

   ^2Had not the Lord been on our side,

   when men rose us to slay;


   ^3They had us swallow'd quick, when as

   their wrath gainst us did flame:

   ^4Waters had cover'd us, our soul

   had sunk beneath the stream.


   ^5Then had the waters, swelling high,

   over our soul made way.

   ^6Bless'd be the Lord, who to their teeth

   us gave not for a prey.


   ^7Our soul's escaped, as a bird

   out of the fowler's snare;

   The snare asunder broken is,

   and we escaped are.


   ^8Our sure and all-sufficient help

   is in Jehovah's name;

   His name who did the heav'n create,

   and who the earth did frame.

Second Version (10.10.10.10.10.)

   10,10,10,10,10


   ^1Now Israel

   may say, and that truly,

   If that the Lord

   had not our cause maintain'd;

   ^2If that the Lord

   had not our right sustain'd,

   When cruel men

   against us furiously

   Rose up in wrath,

   to make of us their prey;


   ^3Then certainly

   they had devour'd us all,

   And swallow'd quick,

   for ought that we could deem;

   Such was their rage,

   as we might well esteem.

   ^4And as fierce floods

   before them all things drown,

   So had they brought

   our soul to death quite down.


   ^5The raging streams,

   with their proud swelling waves,

   Had then our soul

   o'erwhelmed in the deep.

   ^6But bless'd be God,

   who doth us safely keep,

   And hath not giv'n

   us for a living prey

   Unto their teeth,

   and bloody cruelty.


   ^7Ev'n as a bird

   out of the fowler's snare

   Escapes away,

   so is our soul set free:

   Broke are their nets,

   and thus escaped we.

   ^8Therefore our help

   is in the Lord's great name,

   Who heav'n and earth

   by his great pow'r did frame.

   ^1They in the Lord that firmly trust

   but standeth ever still.


   ^2As round about Jerusalem

   the mountains stand alway,

   The Lord his folk doth compass so,

   from henceforth and for aye.


   ^3For ill men's rod upon the lot

   of just men shall not lie;

   Lest righteous men stretch forth their hands

   unto iniquity.


   ^4Do thou to all those that be good

   thy goodness, Lord, impart;

   And do thou good to those that are

   upright within their heart.


   ^5But as for such as turn aside

   after their crooked way,

   God shall lead forth with wicked men:

   on Isr'el peace shall stay.

   ^1When Sion's bondage God turn'd back,

   our tongue with melody:


   They mong the heathen said, The Lord

   great things for them hath wrought.

   ^3The Lord hath done great things for us,

   whence joy to us is brought.


   ^4As streams of water in the south,

   our bondage, Lord, recall.

   ^5Who sow in tears, a reaping time

   of joy enjoy they shall.


   ^6That man who, bearing precious seed,

   ^2'Tis vain for you to rise betimes,

   he his beloved sleep.


   ^3Lo, children are God's heritage,

   the womb's fruit his reward.

   ^4The sons of youth as arrows are,

   for strong men's hands prepar'd.


   ^5O happy is the man that hath

   8,6,8,6


   ^1David, and his afflictions all,

   Lord, do thou think upon;

   ^2How unto God he sware, and vow'd

   to Jacob's mighty One.


   ^3I will not come within my house,

   nor rest in bed at all;

   ^4Nor shall mine eyes take any sleep,

   nor eyelids slumber shall;


   ^5Till for the Lord a place I find,

   where he may make abode;

   A place of habitation

   for Jacob's mighty God.


   ^6Lo, at the place of Ephratah

   of it we understood;

   And we did find it in the fields,

   and city of the wood.


   ^7We'll go into his tabernacles,

   and at his footstool bow.

   ^8Arise, O Lord, into thy rest,

   th' ark of thy strength, and thou.


   ^9O let thy priests be clothed, Lord,

   with truth and righteousness;

   And let all those that are thy saints

   shout loud for joyfulness.


   ^10For thine own servant David's sake,

   do not deny thy grace;

   Nor of thine own anointed one

   turn thou away the face.


   ^11The Lord in truth to David sware,

   he will not turn from it,

   I of thy body's fruit will make

   upon thy throne to sit.


   ^12My cov'nant if thy sons will keep,

   and laws to them made known,

   Their children then shall also sit

   for ever on thy throne.


   ^13For God of Sion hath made choice;

   there he desires to dwell.

   ^14This is my rest, here still I'll stay;

   for I do like it well.


   ^15Her food I'll greatly bless; her poor

   with bread will satisfy.

   ^16Her priests I'll clothe with health; her saints

   shall shout forth joyfully.


   ^17And there will I make David's horn

   to bud forth pleasantly:

   For him that mine anointed is

   a lamp ordain'd have I.


   ^18As with a garment I will clothe

   with shame his en'mies all:

   But yet the crown that he doth wear

   upon him flourish shall.

   of our God make abode.


   ^3Praise ye the Lord, for he is good;

   unto him praises sing:

   Sing praises to his name, because

   it is a pleasant thing.


   ^4For Jacob to himself the Lord

   did chuse of his good pleasure,

   And he hath chosen Israel

   for his peculiar treasure.


   ^5Because I know assuredly

   the Lord is very great,

   And that our Lord above all gods

   in glory hath his seat.


   ^6What things soever pleas'd the Lord,

   that in the heav'n did he,

   And in the earth, the seas, and all

   the places deep that be.


   ^7He from the ends of earth doth make

   the vapours to ascend;

   With rain he lightnings makes, and wind

   doth from his treasures send.


   ^8Egypt's first-born, from man to beast

   ^9who smote. Strange tokens he

   On Phar'oh and his servants sent,

   Egypt, in midst of thee.


   ^10He smote great nations, slew great kings:

   ^11Sihon of Heshbon king,

   And Og of Bashan, and to nought

   did Canaan's kingdoms bring:


   ^12And for a wealthy heritage

   their pleasant land he gave,

   An heritage which Israel,

   his chosen folk, should have.


   ^13Thy name, O Lord, shall still endure,

   and thy memorial

   With honour shall continu'd be

   to generations all.


   ^14For why? the righteous God will judge

   his people righteously;

   Concerning those that do him serve,

   himself repent will he.


   ^15The idols of the nations

   of silver are and gold,

   And by the hands of men is made

   their fashion and mould.


   ^16Mouths have they, but they do not speak;

   eyes, but they do not see;

   ^17Ears have they, but hear not; and in

   their mouths no breathing be.


   ^18Their makers are like them; so are

   all that on them rely.

   ^19O Isr'el's house, bless God; bless God,

   O Aaron's family.


   ^20O bless the Lord, of Levi's house

   ye who his servants are;

   And bless the holy name of God,

   all ye the Lord that fear.


   ^21And blessed be the Lord our God

   from Sion's holy hill,

   Who dwelleth at Jerusalem.

   'Gainst my foes' wrath thou'lt stretch thine hand;

   thy right hand shall me save.


   ^8Surely that which concerneth me

   the Lord will perfect make:

   Lord, still thy mercy lasts; do not

   thine own hands' works forsake.

Psalm 139

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord, thou hast me search'd and known.

   ^2Thou know'st my sitting down,

   And rising up; yea, all my thoughts

   afar to thee are known.


   ^3My footsteps, and my lying down,

   thou compassest always;

   Thou also most entirely art

   acquaint with all my ways.


   ^4For in my tongue, before I speak,

   not any word can be,

   But altogether, lo, O Lord,

   it is well known to thee.


   ^5Behind, before, thou hast beset,

   and laid on me thine hand.

   ^6Such knowledge is too strange for me,

   too high to understand.


   ^7From thy Sp'rit whither shall I go?

   or from thy presence fly?

   ^8Ascend I heav'n, lo, thou art there;

   there, if in hell I lie.


   ^9Take I the morning wings, and dwell

   in utmost parts of sea;

   ^10Ev'n there, Lord, shall thy hand me lead,

   thy right hand hold shall me.


   ^11If I do say that darkness shall

   me cover from thy sight,

   Then surely shall the very night

   about me be as light.


   ^12Yea, darkness hideth not from thee,

   but night doth shine as day:

   To thee the darkness and the light

   are both alike alway.


   ^13For thou possessed hast my reins,

   and thou hast cover'd me,

   When I within my mother's womb

   inclosed was by thee.


   ^14Thee will I praise; for fearfully

   and strangely made I am;

   Thy works are marv'llous, and right well

   my soul doth know the same.


   ^15My substance was not hid from thee,

   when as in secret I

   Was made; and in earth's lowest parts

   was wrought most curiously.


   ^16Thine eyes my substance did behold,

   yet being unperfect;

   And in the volume of thy book

   my members all were writ;


   Which after in continuance

   were fashion'd ev'ry one,

   When as they yet all shapeless were,

   and of them there was none.


   ^17How precious also are thy thoughts,

   O gracious God, to me!

   And in their sum how passing great

   and numberless they be!


   ^18If I should count them, than the sand

   they more in number be:

   What time soever I awake,

   I ever am with thee.


   ^19Thou, Lord, wilt sure the wicked slay:

   hence from me bloody men.

   ^20Thy foes against thee loudly speak,

   and take thy name in vain.


   ^21Do not I hate all those, O Lord,

   that hatred bear to thee?

   With those that up against thee rise

   can I but grieved be?


   ^22With perfect hatred them I hate,

   my foes I them do hold.

   ^23Search me, O God, and know my heart,

   try me, my thoughts unfold:


   ^24And see if any wicked way

   there be at all in me;

   And in thine everlasting way

   to me a leader be.

Psalm 140

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, from the ill and froward man

   give me deliverance,

   And do thou safe preserve me from

   the man of violence:


   ^2Who in their heart mischievous things

   are meditating ever;

   And they for war assembled are

   continually together.


   ^3Much like unto a serpent's tongue

   their tongues they sharp do make;

   And underneath their lips there lies

   the poison of a snake.


   ^4Lord, keep me from the wicked's hands,

   from vi'lent men me save;

   Who utterly to overthrow

   my goings purpos'd have.


   ^5The proud for me a snare have hid,

   and cords; yea, they a net

   Have by the way-side for me spread;

   they gins for me have set.


   ^6I said unto the Lord, Thou art

   my God: unto the cry

   Of all my supplications,

   Lord, do thine ear apply.


   ^7O God the Lord, who art the strength

   of my salvation:

   A cov'ring in the day of war

   my head thou hast put on.


   ^8Unto the wicked man, O Lord,

   his wishes do not grant;

   Nor further thou his ill device,

   lest they themselves should vaunt.


   ^9As for the head and chief of those

   about that compass me,

   Ev'n by the mischief of their lips

   let thou them cover'd be.


   ^10Let burning coals upon them fall,

   them throw in fiery flame,

   And in deep pits, that they no more

   may rise out of the same.


   ^11Let not an evil speaker be

   on earth established:

   Mischief shall hunt the vi'lent man,

   till he be ruined.


   ^12I know God will th' afflicted's cause

   maintain, and poor men's right.

   ^13Surely the just shall praise thy name;

   th' upright dwell in thy sight.

Psalm 141

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O Lord, I unto thee do cry,

   do thou make haste to me,

   And give an ear unto my voice,

   when I cry unto thee.


   ^2As incense let my prayer be

   directed in thine eyes;

   And the uplifting of my hands

   as th' ev ning sacrifice.


   ^3Set, Lord, a watch before my mouth,

   keep of my lips the door.

   ^4My heart incline thou not unto

   the ills I should abhor,


   To practise wicked works with men

   that work iniquity;

   And with their delicates my taste

   let me not satisfy.


   ^5Let him that righteous is me smite,

   it shall a kindness be;

   Let him reprove, I shall it count

   a precious oil to me:


   Such smiting shall not break my head;

   for yet the time shall fall,

   When I in their calamities

   to God pray for them shall.


   ^6When as their judges down shall be

   in stony places cast,

   Then shall they hear my words; for they

   shall sweet be to their taste.


   ^7About the grave's devouring mouth

   our bones are scatter'd round,

   As wood which men do cut and cleave

   lies scatter'd on the ground.


   ^8But unto thee, O God the Lord,

   mine eyes uplifted be:

   My soul do not leave destitute;

   my trust is set on thee.


   ^9Lord, keep me safely from the snares

   which they for me prepare;

   And from the subtile gins of them

   that wicked workers are.


   ^10Let workers of iniquity

   into their own nets fall,

   Whilst I do, by thine help, escape

   the danger of them all.

Psalm 142

   Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1I with my voice cry'd to the Lord,

   with it made my request:

   ^2Pour'd out to him my plaint, to him

   my trouble I exprest.


   ^3When in me was o'erwhelm'd my sp'rit,

   then well thou knew'st my way;

   Where I did walk a snare for me

   they privily did lay.


   ^4I look'd on my right hand, and view'd,

   but none to know me were;

   All refuge failed me, no man

   did for my soul take care.


   ^5I cry'd to thee; I said, Thou art

   my refuge, Lord, alone;

   And in the land of those that live

   thou art my portion.


   ^6Because I am brought very low,

   attend unto my cry:

   Me from my persecutors save,

   who stronger are than I.


   ^7From prison bring my soul, that I

   thy name may glorify:

   The just shall compass me, when thou

   with me deal'st bounteously.

Psalm 143

   A Psalm of David.

First Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Lord, hear my pray'r, attend my suits;

   and in thy faithfulness

   Give thou an answer unto me,

   and in thy righteousness.


   ^2Thy servant also bring thou not

   in judgment to be try'd:

   Because no living man can be

   in thy sight justify'd.


   ^3For th' en'my hath pursu'd my soul,

   my life to ground down tread:

   In darkness he hath made me dwell,

   as who have long been dead.


   ^4My sp'rit is therefore overwhelm'd

   in me perplexedly;

   Within me is my very heart

   amazed wondrously.


   ^5I call to mind the days of old,

   to meditate I use

   On all thy works; upon the deeds

   I of thy hands do muse.


   ^6My hands to thee I stretch; my soul

   thirsts, as dry land, for thee.

   ^7Haste, Lord, to hear, my spirit fails:

   hide not thy face from me;


   Lest like to them I do become

   that go down to the dust.

   ^8At morn let me thy kindness hear;

   for in thee do I trust.


   Teach me the way that I should walk:

   I lift my soul to thee.

   ^9Lord, free me from my foes; I flee

   to thee to cover me.


   ^10Because thou art my God, to do

   thy will do me instruct:

   Thy Sp'rit is good, me to the land

   of uprightness conduct.


   ^11Revive and quicken me, O Lord,

   ev'n for thine own name's sake;

   And do thou, for thy righteousness,

   my soul from trouble take.


   ^12And of thy mercy slay my foes;

   let all destroyed be

   That do afflict my soul: for I

   a servant am to thee.

Psalm 143

Second Version (6.6.6.6.D.)

   6,6,6,6


   ^1Oh, hear my prayer, Lord,

   And unto my desire

   To bow thine ear accord,

   I humbly thee require;

   And, in thy faithfulness,

   Unto me answer make,

   And, in thy righteousness,

   Upon me pity take.


   ^2In judgment enter not

   With me thy servant poor;

   For why, this well I wot,

   No sinner can endure

   The sight of thee, O God:

   If thou his deeds shalt try,

   He dare make none abode

   Himself to justify.


   ^3Behold, the cruel foe

   Me persecutes with spite,

   My soul to overthrow:

   Yea, he my life down quite

   Unto the ground hath smote,

   And made me dwell full low

   In darkness, as forgot,

   Or men dead long ago.


   ^4Therefore my sp'rit much vex'd,

   O'erwhelm'd is me within;

   My heart right sore perplex'd

   And desolate hath been.

   ^5Yet I do call to mind

   What ancient days record,

   Thy works of ev'ry kind

   I think upon, O Lord.


   ^6Lo, I do stretch my hands

   To thee, my help alone;

   For thou well understands

   All my complaint and moan:

   My thirsting soul desires,

   And longeth after thee,

   As thirsty ground requires

   With rain refresh'd to be.


   ^7Lord, let my pray'r prevail,

   To answer it make speed;

   For, lo, my sp'rit doth fail:

   Hide not thy face in need;

   Lest I be like to those

   That do in darkness sit,

   Or him that downward goes

   Into the dreadful pit.


   ^8Because I trust in thee,

   O Lord, cause me to hear

   Thy loving-kindness free,

   When morning doth appear:

   Cause me to know the way

   Wherein my path should be;

   For why, my soul on high

   I do lift up to thee.


   ^9From my fierce enemy

   In safety do me guide,

   Because I flee to thee,

   Lord, that thou may'st me hide.

   ^10My God alone art thou,

   Teach me thy righteousness:

   Thy Sp'rit's good, lead me to

   The land of uprightness.


   ^11O Lord, for thy name's sake,

   Be pleas'd to quicken me;

   And, for thy truth, forth take

   My soul from misery.

   ^12And of thy grace destroy

   My foes, and put to shame

   All who my soul annoy;

   For I thy servant am.

Psalm 144

   A Psalm of David.

   8,6,8,6


   ^1O blessed ever be the Lord,

   who is my strength and might,

   Who doth instruct my hands to war,

   my fingers teach to fight.


   ^2My goodness, fortress, my high tow'r,

   deliverer, and shield,

   In whom I trust: who under me

   my people makes to yield.


   ^3Lord, what is man, that thou of him

   dost so much knowledge take?

   Or son of man, that thou of him

   so great account dost make?


   ^4Man is like vanity; his days,

   as shadows, pass away.

   ^5Lord, bow thy heav'ns, come down,

   touch thou the hills, and smoke shall they.


   ^6Cast forth thy lightning, scatter them;

   thine arrows shoot, them rout.

   ^7Thine hand send from above, me save;

   from great depths draw me out;


   And from the hand of children strange,

   ^8Whose mouth speaks vanity;

   And their right hand is a right hand

   that works deceitfully.


   ^9A new song I to thee will sing,

   Lord, on a psaltery;

   I on a ten-string'd instrument

   will praises sing to thee.


   ^10Ev'n he it is that unto kings

   salvation doth send;

   Who his own servant David doth

   from hurtful sword defend.


   ^11O free me from strange children's hand,

   whose mouth speaks vanity;

   And their right hand a right hand is

   that works deceitfully.


   ^12That, as the plants, our sons may be

   in youth grown up that are;

   Our daughters like to corner-stones,

   carv'd like a palace fair.


   ^13That to afford all kind of store

   our garners may be fill'd;

   That our sheep thousands, in our streets

   ten thousands they may yield.


   ^14That strong our oxen be for work,

   that no in-breaking be,

   Nor going out; and that our streets

   may from complaints be free.


   ^15Those people blessed are who be

   in such a case as this;

   Yea, blessed all those people are,

   whose God Jehovah is.

Psalm 145

   David's Psalm of praise.

First Version (C.M.)

   8,6,8,6


   ^1I'll thee extol, my God, O King;

   I'll bless thy name always.

   ^2Thee will I bless each day, and will

   thy name for ever praise.


   ^3Great is the Lord, much to be prais'd;

   his greatness search exceeds.

   ^4Race unto race shall praise thy works,

   and shew thy mighty deeds.


   ^5I of thy glorious majesty

   the honour will record;

   I'll speak of all thy mighty works,

   which wondrous are, O Lord.


   ^6Men of thine acts the might shall show,

   thine acts that dreadful are;

   And I, thy glory to advance,

   thy greatness will declare.


   ^7The mem'ry of thy goodness great

   they largely shall express;

   With songs of praise they shall extol

   thy perfect righteousness.


   ^8The Lord is very gracious,

   in him compassions flow;

   In mercy he is very great,

   and is to anger slow.


   ^9The Lord Jehovah unto all

   his goodness doth declare;

   And over all his other works

   his tender mercies are.


   ^10Thee all thy works shall praise, O Lord,

   and thee thy saints shall bless;

   ^11They shall thy kingdom's glory show,

   thy pow'r by speech express:


   ^12To make the sons of men to know

   his acts done mightily,

   And of his kingdom th' excellent

   and glorious majesty.


   ^13Thy kingdom shall for ever stand,

   thy reign through ages all.

   ^14God raiseth all that are bow'd down,

   upholdeth all that fall.


   ^15The eyes of all things wait on thee,

   the giver of all good;

   And thou, in time convenient,

   bestow'st on them their food:


   ^16Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally,

   and of thy bounty gives

   Enough to satisfy the need

   of ev'ry thing that lives.


   ^17The Lord is just in all his ways,

   holy in his works all.

   ^18God's near to all that call on him,

   in truth that on him call.


   ^19He will accomplish the desire

   of those that do him fear:

   He also will deliver them,

   and he their cry will hear.


   ^20The Lord preserves all who him love,

   that nought can them annoy:

   But he all those that wicked are

   will utterly destroy.


   ^21My mouth the praises of the Lord

   to publish cease shall never:

   Let all flesh bless his holy name

   for ever and for ever.

   Unto thy holy name always.


   ^2Each day I rise I will thee bless,

   And praise thy name time without end.

   ^3Much to be prais'd, and great God is;

   His greatness none can comprehend.


   ^4Race shall thy works praise unto race,

   The mighty acts show done by thee.

   ^5I will speak of the glorious grace,

   And honour of thy majesty;


   Thy wondrous works I will record.

   ^6By men the might shall be extoll'd

   Of all thy dreadful acts, O Lord:

   And I thy greatness will unfold.


   ^7They utter shall abundantly

   The mem'ry of thy goodness great;

   And shall sing praises cheerfully,

   Whilst they thy righteousness relate.


   ^8The Lord our God is gracious,

   Compassionate is he also;

   In mercy he is plenteous,

   But unto wrath and anger slow.


   ^9Good unto all men is the Lord:

   O'er all his works his mercy is.

   ^10Thy works all praise to thee afford:

   Thy saints, O Lord, thy name shall bless.


   ^11The glory of thy kingdom show

   Shall they, and of thy power tell:

   ^12That so men's sons his deeds may know,

   His kingdom's grace that doth excel.


   ^13Thy kingdom hath none end at all,

   It doth through ages all remain.

   ^14The Lord upholdeth all that fall,

   The cast-down raiseth up again.


   ^15The eyes of all things, Lord, attend,

   And on thee wait that here do live,

   And thou, in season due, dost send

   Sufficient food them to relieve.


   ^16Yea, thou thine hand dost open wide,

   And ev'ry thing dost satisfy

   That lives, and doth on earth abide,

   Of thy great liberality.


   ^17The Lord is just in his ways all,

   And holy in his works each one.

   ^18He's near to all that on him call,

   Who call in truth on him alone.


   ^19God will the just desire fulfil

   Of such as do him fear and dread:

   Their cry regard, and hear he will,

   And save them in the time of need.


   ^20The Lord preserves all, more and less,

   That bear to him a loving heart:

   But workers all of wickedness

   Destroy will he, and clean subvert.


   ^21Therefore my mouth and lips I'll frame

   To speak the praises of the Lord:

   To magnify his holy name

   For ever let all flesh accord.

   ^3Trust not in princes, nor man's son,

   in whom there is no stay:

   ^4His breath departs, to's earth he turns;

   that day his thoughts decay.


   ^5O happy is that man and blest,

   whom Jacob's God doth aid;

   Whose hope upon the Lord doth rest,

   ^6Who made the earth and heavens high,

   who made the swelling deep,

   who truth doth ever keep:

   for those oppress'd that be,

   Who to the hungry giveth food;

   God sets the pris'ners free.


   ^8The Lord doth give the blind their sight,

   the bowed down doth raise:

   The Lord doth dearly love all those

   that walk in upright ways.


   ^9The stranger's shield, the widow's stay,

   the orphan's help, is he:

   But yet by him the wicked's way

   turn'd upside down shall be.

   ^1Praise ye the Lord; for it is good

   For it is pleasant, and to praise

   it is a comely thing.


   ^2God doth build up Jerusalem;

   and he it is alone

   That the dispers'd of Israel

   doth gather into one.


   ^3Those that are broken in their heart,

   and grieved in their minds,

   He healeth, and their painful wounds

   he tenderly up-binds.


   ^4He counts the number of the stars;

   he names them ev'ry one.

   ^5Great is our Lord, and of great pow'r;

   his wisdom search can none.


   ^6The Lord lifts up the meek; and casts

   the wicked to the ground.

   ^7Sing to the Lord, and give him thanks;

   on harp his praises sound;


   ^8Who covereth the heav'n with clouds,

   who for the earth below

   Prepareth rain, who maketh grass

   upon the mountains grow.


   ^9He gives the beast his food, he feeds

   the ravens young that cry.

   ^10His pleasure not in horses' strength,

   nor in man's legs, doth lie.


   ^11But in all those that do him fear

   the Lord doth pleasure take;

   In those that to his mercy do

   by hope themselves betake.


   ^12The Lord praise, O Jerusalem;

   Sion, thy God confess:

   ^13For thy gates' bars he maketh strong;

   thy sons in thee doth bless.


   ^14He in thy borders maketh peace;

   with fine wheat filleth thee.

   ^15He sends forth his command on earth,

   his word runs speedily.


   ^16Hoar-frost, like ashes, scatt'reth he;

   like wool he snow doth give:

   ^17Like morsels casteth forth his ice;

   who in its cold can live?


   ^18He sendeth forth his mighty word,

   and melteth them again;

   His wind he makes to blow, and then

   the waters flow amain.


   ^19The doctrine of his holy word

   to Jacob he doth show;

   His statutes and his judgments he

   gives Israel to know.


   ^20To any nation never he

   such favour did afford;

   For they his judgments have not known.

   O do ye praise the Lord.

   ^9Praise ye his name,

   Hills great and small,

   Trees low and tall;

   ^10Beasts wild and tame;


   All things that creep or fly.

   ^11Ye kings, ye vulgar throng,

   All princes mean or high;

   ^12Both men and virgins young,

   Ev'n young and old,

   ^13Exalt his name;

   For much his fame

   Should be extoll'd.


   O let God's name be prais'd

   Above both earth and sky;

   ^14For he his saints hath rais'd,

   And set their horn on high;

   Ev'n those that be

   Of Isr'el's race,

   Near to his grace.

   The Lord praise ye.

Psalm 149

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Praise ye the Lord: unto him sing

   a new song, and his praise

   In the assembly of his saints

   in sweet psalms do ye raise.


   ^2Let Isr'el in his Maker joy,

   and to him praises sing:

   Let all that Sion's children are

   be joyful in their King.


   ^3O let them unto his great name

   give praises in the dance;

   Let them with timbrel and with harp

   in songs his praise advance.


   ^4For God doth pleasure take in those

   that his own people be;

   And he with his salvation

   the meek will beautify.


   ^5And in his glory excellent

   let all his saints rejoice:

   Let them to him upon their beds

   aloud lift up their voice.


   ^6Let in their mouth aloft be rais'd

   the high praise of the Lord,

   And let them have in their right hand

   a sharp two-edged sword;


   ^7To execute the vengeance due

   upon the heathen all,

   And make deserved punishment

   upon the people fall.


   ^8And ev'n with chains, as pris'ners, bind

   their kings that them command;

   Yea, and with iron fetters strong,

   the nobles of their land.


   ^9On them the judgment to perform

   found written in his word:

   This honour is to all his saints.

   O do ye praise the Lord.

Psalm 150

   8,6,8,6


   ^1Praise ye the Lord. God's praise within

   his sanctuary raise;

   And to him in the firmament

   of his pow'r give ye praise.


   ^2Because of all his mighty acts,

   with praise him magnify:

   O praise him, as he doth excel

   in glorious majesty.


   ^3Praise him with trumpet's sound; his praise

   with psaltery advance:

   ^4With timbrel, harp, string'd instruments,

   and organs, in the dance.


   ^5Praise him on cymbals loud; him praise

   on cymbals sounding high.

   ^6Let each thing breathing praise the Lord.

   Praise to the Lord give ye.

Genesis 1

   8,6,8,6


   Let heav'n arise, let earth appear,

   said the Almighty Lord:

   The heav'n arose, the earth appeared,

   at his creating word.


   Thick darkness brooded o'er the deep:

   God said, Let there be light:'

   The light shone forth with smiling ray,

   and scattered ancient night.


   He bade the clouds ascend on high;

   the clouds ascend, and bear

   A wat'ry treasure to the sky,

   and float upon the air.


   The liquid element below

   was gathered by his hand;

   The rolling seas together flow,

   and leave the solid land.


   With herbs, and plants, and fruitful trees,

   the new-formed globe he crowned,

   Ere there was rain to bless the soil,

   or sun to warm the ground.


   Then high in heav'n's resplendent arch

   he placed two orbs of light,

   He set the sun to rule the day,

   the moon to rule the night.


   Next, from the deep, th' Almighty King

   did vital beings frame;

   Fowls of the air of every wing,

   and fish of every name.


   To all the various brutal tribes

   he gave their wondrous birth;

   At once the lion and the worm

   sprung from the teeming earth.


   Then, chief o'er all his works below,

   at last was Adam made;

   His Maker's image blessed his soul,

   and glory crowned his head.


   Fair in th' Almighty Maker's eye

   the whole creation stood.

   He viewed the fabric he had raised;

   his word pronounced it good.

Genesis 28:20-22

   8,6,8,6


   O God of Bethel! by whose hand

   thy people still are fed;

   Who through this weary pilgrimage

   hast all our fathers led:


   Our vows, our prayers, we now present

   before thy throne of grace:

   God of our fathers! be the God

   of their succeeding race.


   Through each perplexing path of life

   our wand'ring footsteps guide;

   Give us each day our daily bread,

   and raiment fit provide.


   O spread thy cov'ring wings around,

   till all our wand'rings cease,

   And at our Father's loved abode

   our souls arrive in peace.


   Such blessings from thy gracious hand

   our humble pray'rs implore;

   And thou shalt be our chosen God,

   and portion evermore.

Job 1:21

   8,6,8,6


   Naked as from the earth we came,

   and entered life at first;

   Naked we to the earth return,

   and mix with kindred dust.


   Whate'er we fondly call our own

   belongs to heav'n's great Lord;

   The blessings lent us for a day

   are soon to be restored.


   'Tis God that lifts our comforts high,

   or sinks them in the grave:

   He gives; and, when he takes away,

   he takes but what he gave.


   Then, ever blessed be his name!

   his goodness swelled our store;

   His justice but resumes its own;

   'tis ours still to adore.

Job 3:17-20

   8,6,8,6


   How still and peaceful is the grave!

   where, life's vain tumults past,

   Th' appointed house, by Heav'n's decree,

   receives us all at last.


   The wicked there from troubling cease,

   their passions rage no more;

   And there the weary pilgrim rests

   from all the toils he bore.


   There rest the pris'ners, now released

   from slavery's sad abode;

   No more they hear th' oppressor's voice,

   or dread the tyrant's rod.


   There servants, masters, small and great,

   partake the same repose;

   And there, in peace, the ashes mix

   of those who once were foes.


   All, levelled by the hand of Death,

   lie sleeping in the tomb;

   Till God in judgment calls them forth,

   to meet their final doom.

Job 5:6-12

   8,6,8,6


   Though trouble springs not from the dust,

   nor sorrow from the ground;

   Yet ills on ills, by Heav'n's decree,

   in man's estate are found.


   As sparks in close succession rise,

   so man, the child of woe,

   Is doomed to endless cares and toils

   through all his life below.


   But with my God I leave my cause;

   from him I seek relief;

   To him, in confidence of prayer

   unbosom all my grief.


   Unnumbered are his wondrous works,

   unsearchable his ways;

   'Tis his the mourning soul to cheer,

   the bowed down to raise.

Job 8:11-22

   8,6,8,6


   The rush may rise where waters flow,

   and flags beside the stream;

   But soon their verdure fades and dies

   before the scorching beam


   So is the sinner's hope cut off;

   or, if it transient rise,

   'Tis like the spider's airy web,

   from every breath that flies.


   Fixed on his house he leans; his house

   and all its props decay:

   He holds it fast; but, while he holds,

   the tott'ring frame gives way.


   Fair in his garden, to the sun

   his boughs with verdure smile;

   And, deeply fixed, his spreading roots

   unshaken stand a while.


   But forth the sentence flies from Heav'n,

   that sweeps him from his place;

   Which then denies him for its lord,

   nor owns it knew his face.


   Lo! this the joy of wicked men,

   who Heav'n's high laws despise:

   They quickly fall; and in their room

   as quickly others rise.


   But, for the just, with gracious care,

   God will his power employ;

   He'll teach their lips to sing his praise,

   and fill their hearts with joy.

Job 9:2-10

   8,6,8,6


   How should the sons of Adam's race

   be pure before their God?

   If he contends in righteousness,

   we sink beneath his rod.


   If he should mark my words and thoughts

   with strict enquiring eyes,

   Could I for one of thousand faults

   the least excuse devise?


   Strong in his arm, his heart is wise;

   who dares with him contend?

   Or who, that tries th' unequal strife,

   shall prosper in the end?


   He makes the mountains feel his wrath,

   and their old seats forsake;

   The trembling earth deserts her place,

   and all her pillars shake.


   He bids the sun forbear to rise;

   th' obedient sun forbears:

   His hand with sackcloth spreads the skies,

   and seals up all the stars.


   He walks upon the raging sea;

   flies on the stormy wind:

   None can explore his wondrous way,

   or his dark footsteps find.

Job 14:1-15

   8,6,8,6


   Few are thy days, and full of woe,

   O man, of woman born!

   Thy doom is written, Dust thou art,

   and shalt to dust return.'


   Behold the emblem of thy state

   in flow'rs that bloom and die,

   Or in the shadow's fleeting form,

   that mocks the gazer's eye.


   Guilty and frail, how shalt thou stand

   before thy sov'reign Lord?

   Can troubled and polluted springs

   a hallowed stream afford?


   Determined are the days that fly

   successive o'er thy head;

   The numbered hour is on the wing

   that lays thee with the dead.


   Great God! afflict not in thy wrath

   the short allotted span

   That bounds the few and weary days

   of pilgrimage to man.


   All nature dies, and lives again:

   the flow'r that paints the field,

   The trees that crown the mountain's brow,

   and boughs and blossoms yield,


   Resign the honours of their form

   at Winter's stormy blast,

   And leave the naked leafless plain

   a desolated waste.


   Yet soon reviving plants and flow'rs

   anew shall deck the plain;

   The woods shall hear the voice of Spring,

   and flourish green again.


   But man forsakes this earthly scene,

   ah! never to return:

   Shall any foll'wing spring revive

   the ashes of the urn?


   The mighty flood that rolls along

   its torrents to the main,

   Can ne'er recall its waters lost

   from that abyss again.


   So days, and years, and ages past,

   descending down to night,

   Can henceforth never more return

   back to the gates of light;


   And man, when laid in lonesome grave,

   shall sleep in Death's dark gloom,

   Until th' eternal morning wake

   the slumbers of the tomb,


   O may the grave become to me

   the bed of peaceful rest,

   Whence I shall gladly rise at length,

   and mingle with the blest!


   Cheered by this hope, with patient mind,

   I'll wait Heav'n's high decree,

   Till the appointed period come,

   when death shall set me free.

Job 26:6, to the end

   8,6,8,6


   Who can resist th' Almighty arm

   that made the starry sky?

   Or who elude the certain glance

   of God's all-seeing eye?


   From him no cov'ring vails our crimes;

   hell opens to his sight;

   And all Destruction's secret snares

   lie full disclosed in light.


   Firm on the boundless void of space

   he poised the steady pole,

   And in the circle of his clouds

   bade secret waters roll.


   While nature's universal frame

   its Maker's power reveals,

   His throne, remote from mortal eyes

   an awful cloud conceals.


   From where the rising day ascends,

   to where it sets in night,

   He compasses the floods with bounds,

   and checks their threat'ning might.


   The pillars that support the sky

   tremble at his rebuke;

   Through all its caverns quakes the earth,

   as though its centre shook.


   He brings the waters from their beds,

   although no tempest blows,

   And smites the kingdom of the proud

   without the hand of foes.


   With bright inhabitants above

   he fills the heavenly land,

   And all the crooked serpent's breed

   dismayed before him stand.


   Few of his works can we survey;

   these few our skill transcend:

   But the full thunder of his pow'r

   what heart can comprehend?

Prov. 1:20-31

   8,6,8,6


   In streets, and op'nings of the gates,

   where pours the busy crowd,

   Thus heav'nly Wisdom lifts her voice,

   and cries to men aloud:


   How long, ye scorners of the truth,

   scornful will ye remain?

   How long shall fools their folly love,

   and hear my words in vain?


   O turn, at last, at my reproof!

   and, in that happy hour,

   His bless'd effusions on your heart

   my Spirit down shall pour.


   But since so long, with earnest voice,

   to you in vain I call

   Since all my counsels and reproofs

   thus ineffectual fall;


   The time will come, when humbled low,

   in Sorrow's evil day,

   Your voice by anguish shall be taught,

   but taught too late, to pray.


   When, like the whirlwind, o'er the deep

   comes Desolation's blast;

   Pray'rs then extorted shall be vain,

   the hour of mercy past.


   The choice you made has fixed your doom;

   for this is Heav'n's decree,

   That with the fruits of what he sowed

   the sinner filled shall be.

Prov. 3:13-17

   8,6,8,6


   O happy is the man who hears

   Instruction's warning voice;

   And who celestial Wisdom makes

   his early, only choice.


   For she has treasures greater far

   than east or west unfold;

   And her rewards more precious are

   than all their stores of gold.


   In her right hand she holds to view

   a length of happy days;

   Riches with splendid honours

   are what her left displays.


   She guides the young with innocence,

   in pleasure's paths to tread,

   A crown of glory she bestows

   upon the hoary head.


   According as her labours rise,

   so her rewards increase;

   Her ways are ways of pleasantness,

   And all her paths are peace.

Prov. 6:6-12

   8,8,8,8


   Ye indolent and slothful! rise,

   View the ant's labours, and be wise;

   She has no guide to point her way,

   No ruler chiding her delay:


   Yet see with what incessant cares

   She for the winter's storm prepares;

   In summer she provides her meat,

   And harvest finds her store complete.


   But when will slothful man rise?

   How long shall sleep seal up his eyes?

   Sloth more indulgence still demands;

   Sloth shuts the eyes, and folds the hands.


   But mark the end; want shall assail,

   When all your strength and vigour fail;

   Want, like an armed man, shall rush

   The hoary head of age to crush.

Prov. 8:22, to the end

   8,6,8,6


   Keep silence, all ye sons of men,

   and hear with rev'rence due;

   Eternal Wisdom from above

   thus lifts her voice to you:


   I was th' Almighty's chief delight

   from everlasting days,

   Ere yet his arm was stretched forth

   the heav'ns and earth to raise.


   Before the sea began to flow,

   and leave the solid land,

   Before the hills and mountains rose,

   I dwelt at his right hand.


   When first he reared the arch of heav'n,

   and spread the clouds on air,

   When first the fountains of the deep

   he opened, I was there.


   There I was with him, when he stretched

   his compass o'er the deep,

   And charged the ocean's swelling waves

   within their bounds to keep.


   With joy I saw th' abode prepared

   which men were soon to fill:

   Them from the first of days I loved,

   unchanged, I love them still.


   Now therefore hearken to my words,

   ye children, and be wise:

   Happy the man that keeps my ways;

   the man that shuns them dies.


   Where dubious paths perplex the mind,

   direction I afford;

   Life shall be his that follows me

   and favour from the Lord.


   But he who scorns my sacred laws

   shall deeply wound his heart,

   He courts destruction who contemns

   the counsel I impart.

Eccles. 7:2-6

   8,6,8,6


   While others crowd the house of mirth,

   and haunt the gaudy show,

   Let such as would with Wisdom dwell,

   frequent the house of woe.


   Better to weep with those who weep,

   and share th' afflicted's smart,

   Than mix with fools in giddy joys

   that cheat and wound the heart.


   When virtuous sorrow clouds the face,

   and tears bedim the eye,

   The soul is led to solemn thought,

   and wafted to the Sky.


   The wise in heart revisit oft

   grief's dark sequestered cell;

   The thoughtless still with levity

   and mirth delight to dwell.


   The noisy laughter of the fool

   is like the crackling sound

   Of blazing thorns, which quickly fall

   in ashes to The ground.

Eccles. 9:4,5,6,10

   8,8,8,8


   As long as life its term extends,

   Hope's blest dominion never ends;

   For while the lamp holds on to burn,

   The greatest sinner may return.


   Life is the season God both giv'n

   To fly from hell, and rise to heav'n;

   That day of grace fleets fast away,

   And none its rapid course can stay.


   The living know that they must die;

   But all the dead forgotten lie:

   Their mem'ry and their name is gone,

   Alike unknowing and unknown.


   Their hatred and their love is lost,

   Their envy buried in the dust;

   They have no share in all that's done

   Beneath the circuit of the sun.


   Then what thy thoughts design to do,

   Still let thy bands with might pursue;

   Since no device nor work is found,

   Nor wisdom underneath the ground.


   In the cold grave, to which we haste,

   There are no acts of pardon past:

   But fixed the doom of all remains,

   And everlasting silence reigns.

   And shines in all the fairest charms

   which beauty can disclose;


   Deep on thy soul, before its pow'rs

   are yet by vice enslaved,

   Be thy Creator's glorious name

   and character engraved.


   For soon the shades of grief shall cloud

   the sunshine of thy days;

   And cares, and toils, in endless round,

   encompass all thy ways.


   Soon shall thy heart the woes of age

   in mournful groans deplore,

   And sadly muse on former joys,

   that now return no more.

   Rulers of Sodom! hear the voice

   'Tis thus he speaks; To what intent

   are your oblations vain?

   Why load my altars with your gifts,

   polluted and profane?


   Burnt-off'rings long may blaze to heav'n,

   and incense cloud the skies;

   The worship and the worshipper

   are hateful in my eyes.


   Your rites, your fasts, your pray'rs, I scorn,

   and pomp of solemn days:

   I know your hearts are full of guile,

   and Crooked are your ways.


   But cleanse your hands, ye guilty race,

   and cease from deeds of sin;

   Learn in your actions to be just,

   and pure in heart within.


   Mock not my name with honours vain,

   but keep my holy laws;

   Do justice to the friendless poor,

   and plead the widow's cause.


   Then though your guilty souls are stained

   with sins of crimson dye,

   to us a Son is giv'n;

   Him shall the tribes of earth obey,

   him all the hosts of heav'n.


   His name shall be the Prince of Peace,

   for evermore adored,

   The Wonderful, the Counsellor,

   the great and mighty Lord.


   His pow'r increasing still shall spread,

   his reign no end shall know;

   Justice shall guard his throne above,

   and peace abound below.

Isaiah 26:1-7

   8,6,8,6


   How glorious Sion's courts appear,

   the city of our God!

   His throne he hath established here

   here fixed his loved abode.


   Its wall, defended by his grace

   no pow'r shall e'er o'erthrow,

   Salvation is its bulwark sure

   against th' assailing foe.


   Lift up the everlasting gates,

   the doors wide open fling;

   Enter, ye nations, who obey

   the statutes of our King.


   Here shall ye taste unmingled joys,

   and dwell in perfect peace,

   Ye, who have known JEHOVAH's name,

   and trusted in his grace.


   Trust in the Lord, for ever trust,

   and banish all your fears;

   Strength In the Lord JEHOVAH dwells

   eternal as his years.


   What though the wicked dwell on high,

   his arm shall bring them low;

   Low as the caverns of the grave

   their lofty heads shall bow.


   Along the dust shall then be spread

   their tow'rs, that brave the skies:

   On them the needy's feet shall tread,

   and on their ruins rise.

   8,6,8,6


   Attend, ye tribes that dwell remote,

   ye tribes at hand, give ear;

   Th' upright in heart alone have hope.

   the false in heart have fear.


   The man who walks with God in truth,

   and ev'ry guile disdains;

   Who hates to lift oppression's rod,

   and scorns its shameful gains;


   Whose soul abhors the impious bribe

   the tempts from truth to stray,

   And from th' enticing snares of vice

   who turns his eyes away:


   His dwelling, midst the strength of rocks,

   shall ever stand secure;

   His Father will provide his bread,

   his water shall be sure.


   For him the kingdom of the just

   afar doth glorious shine;

   And he the King of kings shall see

   in majesty divine.

Isaiah 40:27, to the end

   8,6,8,6


   Why pour'st thou forth thine anxious plaint,

   despairing of relief,

   As if the Lord o'erlook'd thy cause,

   and did not heed thy grief?


   Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard,

   that firm remains on high

   The everlasting throne of Him

   who formed the earth and sky?


   Art thou afraid his pow'r shall fail

   when comes thy evil day?

   And can an all-creating arm

   grow weary or decay?


   Supreme in wisdom as in pow'r

   the Rock of ages stands;

   Though him thou canst not see, nor trace

   the working of his hands.


   He gives the conquest to the weak,

   supports the fainting heart;

   And courage in the evil hour

   his heav'nly aids impart.


   Mere human pow'r shall fast decay,

   and youthful vigour cease;

   But they who wait upon the Lord,

   in strength shall still increase.


   They with unwearied feet shall tread

   the path of life divine;

   With growing ardent onward move,

   with growing brightness shine.


   On eagles' wings they mount, they soar,

   their wings are faith and love,

   Till, past the cloudy regions here,

   they rise to heav'n above.

Isaiah 42:1-13

   8,6,8,6


   Behold my Servant! see him rise

   exalted in my might!

   Him have I chosen, and in him

   I place supreme delight.


   On him, in rich effusion poured,

   my Spirit shall descend;

   My truths and judgments he shall show

   to earth's remotest end.


   Gentle and still shall be his voice,

   no threats from him proceed;

   The smoking flax he shall not quench,

   nor break the bruised reed.


   The feeble spark to flames he'll raise;

   the weak will not despise;

   Judgment he shall bring forth to truth,

   and make the fallen rise.


   The progress of his zeal and pow'r

   shall never know decline,

   Till foreign lands and distant isles

   receive the law divine.


   He who erected heav'ns bright arch,

   and bade the planets roll,

   Who peopled all the climes of earth,

   and formed the human soul,


   Thus saith the Lord, Thee have I raised,

   my Prophet thee install;

   In right I've raised thee, and in strength

   I'll succour whom I call.


   I will establish with the lands

   a covenant in thee,

   To give the Gentile nations light,

   and set the pris'ners free:


   Asunder burst the gates of brass;

   the iron fetters fall;

   And gladsome light and liberty

   are straight restored to all.


   I am the Lord, and by the name

   of great JEHOVAH known;

   No idol shall usurp my praise,

   nor mount into my throne.


   Lo! former scenes, predicted once

   conspicuous rise to view;

   And future scenes, predicted now,

   shall be accomplished too.


   Sing to the Lord in joyful strains!

   let earth his praise resound,

   Ye who upon the ocean dwell,

   and fill the isles around!


   O city of the Lord! begin

   the universal song;

   And let the scattered villages

   the cheerful notes prolong.


   Let Kedar's wilderness afar

   lift up its lonely voice;

   And let the tenants of the rock

   with accents rude rejoice;


   Till midst the streams of distant lands

   the islands sound his praise;

   And all combined, with one accord,

   JEHOVAH's glories raise.

   and joy through nature flow.


   Behold how gracious is our God!

   hear the consoling strains,

   In which he cheers our drooping hearts,

   and mitigates our pains.


   Cease ye, when days of darkness come,

   in sad dismay to mourn,

   As if the Lord could leave his saints

   forsaken or forlorn.


   Can the fond mother e'er forget

   the infant whom she bore?

   And can its plaintive cries be heard,

   nor move compassion more?


   She may forget: nature may fail

   a parent's heart to move;

   But Sion on my heart shall dwell

   in everlasting love.


   Full in my sight, upon my hands

   I have engraved her name:

   My hands shall build her ruined walls,

   and raise her broken frame.

Isaiah 53

   8,6,8,6


   How few receive with cordial faith

   the tidings which we bring?

   How few have seen the arm revealed

   of heav'n's eternal King?


   The Saviour comes! no outward pomp

   bespeaks his presence nigh;

   No earthly beauty shines in him

   to draw the carnal eye.


   Fair as a beauteous tender flow'r

   amidst the desert grows,

   So slighted by a rebel race

   the heav'nly Saviour rose.


   Rejected and despised of men,

   behold a man of woe!

   Grief was his close companion still

   through all his life below.


   Yet all the griefs he felt were ours,

   ours were the woes he bore:

   Pangs, not his own, his spotless soul

   with bitter anguish tore.


   We held him as condemned by Heav'n,

   an outcast from his God,

   While for our sins he groaned, he bled,

   beneath his Father's rod.


   His sacred blood hath washed our souls

   from sin's polluted stain;

   His stripes es have healed us, and his death

   revived our souls again.


   We all, like sheep, had gone astray

   in ruin's fatal road:

   On him were our transgressions laid;

   he bore the mighty load.


   Wronged and oppressed how meekly he

   in patient silence stood!

   Mute, as the peaceful harmless lamb,

   when brought to shed its blood.


   Who can his generation tell?

   from prison see him led!

   With impious show of law condemned,

   and numbered with the dead.


   'Midst sinners low in dust he lay;

   the rich a grave supplied:

   Unspotted was his blameless life;

   unstained by sin he died.


   Yet God shall raise his head on high,

   though thus he brought him low;

   His sacred off'ring, when complete,

   shall terminate his woe.


   For, saith the Lord, my pleasure then

   shall prosper in his hand;

   His shall a num'rous offspring be,

   and still his honours stand.


   His soul, rejoicing, shall behold

   the purchase of his pain;

   And all the guilty whom he saved

   shall bless Messiah's reign.


   He with the great shall share the spoil,

   and baffle all his foes;

   Though ranked with sinners, here he fell,

   a conqueror he rose.


   He died to bear the guilt of men,

   that sin might be forgiv'n:

   He lives to bless them and defend,

   and plead their cause in heav'n.

Isaiah 55

   8,6,8,6


   Ho! ye that thirst, approach the spring

   where living waters flow:

   Free to that sacred fountain all

   without a price may go.


   How long to streams of false delight

   will ye in crowds repair?

   How long your strength and substance waste

   on trifles, light as air?


   My stores afford those rich supplies

   that health and pleasure give:

   Incline your ear, and come to me;

   the soul that hears shall live.


   With you a cov'nant I will make,

   that ever shall endure;

   The hope which gladdened David's heart

   my mercy hath made sure.


   Behold he comes! your leader comes,

   with might and honour crowned;

   A witness who shall spread my name

   to earth's remotest bound.


   See! nations hasten to his call

   from ev'ry distant shore;

   Isles, yet unknown, shall bow to him,

   and Isr'el's God adore.


   Seek ye the Lord while yet his ear

   is open to your call;

   While offered mercy still is near,

   before his footstool fall.


   Let sinners quit their evil ways,

   their evil thoughts forego:

   And God, when they to him return,

   returning grace will show.


   He pardons with o'erflowing love:

   for, hear the voice divine!

   My nature is not like to yours,

   nor like your ways are mine:


   But far as heav'n's resplendent orbs

   beyond earth's spot extend,

   As far my thoughts, as far my ways,

   your ways and thoughts transcend.


   And as the rains from heav'n distil,

   nor thither mount again,

   But swell the earth with fruitful juice,

   and all its tribes sustain:


   So not a word that flows from me

   shall ineffectual fall;

   But universal nature prove

   obedient to my call.


   With joy and peace shall then be led

   the glad converted lands;

   The lofty mountains then shall sing,

   the forests clap their hands.


   Where briers grew midst barren wilds,

   shall firs and myrtles spring;

   And nature, through its utmost bounds,

   eternal praises sing.

   with sacred rev'rence hear:


   Amidst the majesty of heav'n

   my throne is fixed on high;

   And through eternity I hear

   the praises of the sky:


   Yet, looking down, I visit oft

   the humble hallowed cell;

   And with the penitent who mourn

   'tis my delight to dwell;


   The downcast spirit to revive,

   the sad in soul to cheer;

   And from the bed of dust the man

   of heart contrite to rear.


   With me dwells no relentless wrath

   against the human race;

   The souls which I have formed shall find

   a refuge in my grace.

   which vain dissemblers wear.


   Do I delight In sorrow's dress?

   saith he who reigns above;

   The hanging head and rueful look,

   will they attract my love?


   Let such as feel oppression's load

   thy tender pity share:

   And let the helpless, homeless poor,

   be thy peculiar care.


   Go, bid the hungry orphan be

   with thy abundance blest;

   Invite the wand'rer to thy gate,

   and spread the couch of rest.


   Let him who pines with piercing cold

   by thee be warmed and clad;

   Be thine the blissful task to make

   the downcast mourner glad.


   Then, bright as morning, shall come forth,

   in peace and joy, thy days;

   And glory from the Lord above

   shall shine on all thy ways.

   Amidst the mighty, where is he

   who saith, and it is done?

   Each varying scene of changeful life

   is from the Lord alone.


   He gives in gladsome bow'rs to dwell,

   or clothes in sorrow's shroud;

   His hand hath formed the light, his hand

   hath formed the dark'ning cloud.


   Why should a living man complain

   beneath the chast'ning rod?

   Our sins afflict us; and the cross

   must bring us back to God.


   O sons of men! with anxious care

   your hearts and ways explore;

   Return from paths of vice to God:

   return, and sin no more!

   His voice commands the tempest forth,

   and stills the stormy wave;

   And though his arm be strong to smite,

   'tis also strong to save.


   Long hath the night of sorrow reigned;

   the dawn shall bring us light:

   God shall appear, and we shall rise

   with gladness in his sight.


   Our hearts, if God we seek to know,

   shall know him, and rejoice;

   His coming like the morn shall be,

   like morning songs his voice.


   As dew upon the tender herb,

   diffusing fragrance round;

   As show'rs that usher in the spring,

   and cheer the thirsty ground:


   So shall his presence bless our souls,

   and shed a joyful light;

   That hallowed morn shall chase away

   the sorrows of the night.

   Shall clouds of incense to the skies

   with grateful odour speed?

   Or victims from a thousand hills

   upon the altar bleed?


   Does justice nobler blood demand

   to save the sinner's life?

   Shall, trembling, in his offspring's side

   the father plunge the knife?


   No: God rejects the bloody rites

   which blindfold zeal began;

   His oracles of truth proclaim

   the message brought to man.


   He what is good hath clearly shown,

   O favoured race! to thee;

   And what doth God require of those

   who bend to him the knee?


   Thy deeds, let sacred justice rule;

   thy heart, let mercy fill;

   And, walking humbly with thy God,

   to him resign thy will.

   Though from the fold, with sad surprise,

   where herds were wont to be?


   Yet in the Lord will I be glad,

   and glory in his love;

   In him I'll joy, who will the God

   of my salvation prove.


   He to my tardy feet shall lend

   the swiftness of the roe;

   Till, raised on high, I safely dwell

   beyond the reach of woe.

   Which from the self-conceited mind

   thy wisdom hath concealed.


   Ev'n so! thou, Father, hast ordained

   thy high decree to stand;

   Nor men nor angels may presume

   the reason to demand.


   Thou only know'st the Son: from thee

   my kingdom I receive;

   And none the Father know but they

   who in the Son believe.


   Come then to me, all ye who groan,

   with guilt and fears opprest;

   Resign to me the willing heart,

   and I will give you rest.


   Take up my yoke, and learn of me

   the meek and lowly mind;

   And thus your weary troubled souls

   repose and peace shall find.


   For light and gentle is my yoke;

   Shall ease the heart, which groaned before

   My broken body thus I give

   For you, for all; take, eat, and live;

   And oft the sacred rite renew,

   That brings my wondrous love to view.


   Then in his hands the cup he raised,

   And God anew he thanked and praised;

   While kindness in his bosom glowed,

   And from his lips salvation flowed:


   My blood I thus pour forth, be cries,

   To cleanse the soul in sin that lies;

   In this the covenant is sealed,

   Just and devout old Simeon lived;

   to him it was revealed,

   That Christ, the Lord, his eyes should see

   ere death his eyelids sealed.


   For this consoling gift of Heav'n

   to Isr'el's fallen state,

   From year to year, with patient hope

   the aged saint did wait.


   Nor did he wait in vain; for, lo!

   revolving years brought round,

   In season due, the happy day,

   which all his wishes crowned.


   When Jesus, to the temple brought

   by Mary's pious care,

   As Heav'n's appointed rites required,

   to God was offered there,


   Simeon into those sacred courts

   a heav'nly impulse drew;

   He saw the Virgin hold her Son,

   and straight his Lord he knew.


   With holy joy upon his face

   the good old father smiled;

   Then fondly in his withered arms

   he clasped the promised child:


   And while he held the heav'n-born Babe,

   ordained to bless mankind,

   Thus spoke, with earnest look,

   and heart exulting, yet resigned:


   Now, Lord! according to thy word,

   let me in peace depart;

   Mine eyes have thy salvation seen,

   and gladness fills my heart.


   At length my arms embrace my Lord,

   now let their vigour cease;

   At last my eyes my Saviour see,

   now let them close in peace.


   This great salvation, long prepared,

   and now disclosed to view,

   Hath proved thy love was constant still,

   and promises were true.


   That Sun I now behold, whose light

   shall heathen darkness chase,

   And rays of brightest glory pour

   around thy chosen race.

   The wretched prodigal behold

   in mis'ry lying low,

   Whom vice had sunk from high estate,

   and plunged in want and woe.


   While I, despised and scorned, he cries,

   starve in a foreign land,

   The meanest in my father's house

   is fed with bounteous hand:


   I'll go, and with a mourning voice,

   fall down before his face:

   Father! I've sinned gainst Heav'n and thee,

   nor can deserve thy grace.


   He said, and hastened to his home,

   to seek his father's love;

   The father sees him from afar,

   and all his bowels move.


   He ran, and fell upon his neck,

   embraced and kissed his son:

   The grieving prodigal bewailed

   the follies he had done.


   No more, my father, can I hope

   to find paternal grace;

   My utmost wish is to obtain

   a servant's humble place.


   Bring forth the fairest robe for him,

   and ev'ry honour paid.


   A day of feasting I ordain;

   let mirth and song abound:

   My son was dead, and lives again!

   was lost, and now is found!


   Thus joy abounds in paradise

   among the hosts of heav'n,

   Soon as the sinner quits his sins,

   repents, and is forgiv'n.

John 3:14-19

   8,6,8,6


   As when the Hebrew prophet raised

   the brazen serpent high,

   The wounded looked, and straight were cured,

   the people ceased to die:


   So from the Saviour on the cross

   a healing virtue flows;

   Who looks to him with lively faith

   is saved from endless woes.


   For God gave up his Son to death,

   so gen'rous was his love,

   That all the faithful might enjoy

   eternal life above.


   Not to condemn the sons of men

   the Son of God appeared;

   No weapons in his hand are seen,

   nor voice of terror heard:


   He came to raise our fallen state,

   and our lost hopes restore:

   Faith leads us to the mercy-seat,

   and bids us fear no more.


   But vengeance just for ever lies

   on all the rebel race,

   Who God's eternal Son despise

   and scorn his offered grace.

John 14:1-7

   8,6,8,6


   Let not your hearts with anxious thoughts

   be troubled or dismayed;

   But trust in Providence divine,

   and trust my gracious aid.


   I to my Father's house return;

   there numerous mansions stand,

   And glory manifold abounds

   through all the happy land.


   I go your entrance to secure,

   and your abode prepare;

   Regions unknown are safe to you,

   when I, your friend, am there.


   Thence shall I come, when ages close,

   to take you home with me;

   There we shall meet to part no more,

   and still together be.


   I am the way, the truth, the life:

   no son of human race,

   But such as I conduct and guide,

   shall see my Father's face.

John 14:25-28

   8,6,8,6


   You now must hear my voice no more;

   my Father calls me home;

   But soon from heav'n the Holy Ghost,

   your Comforter, shall come.


   That heav'nly Teacher, sent from God,

   shall your whole soul inspire;

   Your minds shall fill with sacred truth,

   your hearts with sacred fire.


   Peace is the gift I leave with you;

   my peace to you bequeath;

   Peace that shall comfort you through life,

   and cheer your souls in death.


   I give not as the world bestows,

   with promise false and vain;

   Nor cares, nor fears, shall wound the heart

   in which my words remain.

John 19:30

   8,6,8,6


   Behold the Saviour on the cross,

   a spectacle of woe!

   See from his agonizing wounds

   the blood incessant flow;


   Till death's pale ensigns o'er his cheek

   and trembling lips were spread;

   Till light forsook his closing eyes,

   and life his drooping head!


   'Tis finished--was his latest voice;

   these sacred accents o'er,

   He bowed his head, gave up the ghost,

   and suffered pain no more.


   'Tis finished--The Messiah dies

   for sins, but not his own;

   The great redemption is complete,

   and Satan's pow'r o'erthrown.


   'Tis finished--All his groans are past;

   his blood his pain, and toils,

   Have fully vanquished our foes,

   and crowned him with their spoils.


   'Tis finished--Legal worship ends,

   and gospel ages run;

   All old things now are past away,

   and a new world begun.

Romans 2:4-8

   8,6,8,6


   Ungrateful sinners! whence this scorn

   Of God's long-suff'ring grace?

   And whence this madness that insults

   th' Almighty to his face?


   Is it because his patience waits,

   and pitying bowels move,

   You multiply transgressions more,

   and scorn his offered love?


   Dost thou not know, self-blinded man!

   his goodness is designed

   To wake repentance in thy soul,

   and melt thy hardened mind?


   And wilt thou rather chuse to meet

   th' Almighty as thy foe,

   And treasure up his wrath in store

   against the day of woe?


   Soon shall that fatal day approach

   that must thy sentence seal,

   And righteous judgments, now unknown,

   in awful pomp reveal;


   While they, who full of holy deeds

   to glory seek to rise,

   Continuing patient to the end,

   shall gain th' immortal prize.

Romans 3:19-22

   8,6,8,6


   Vain are the hopes the sons of men

   upon their works have built;

   Their hearts by nature are unclean,

   their actions full of guilt.


   Silent let Jew and Gentile stand,

   without one vaunting word,

   And, humbled low, confess their guilt

   before heav'n's righteous Lord.


   No hope can on the law be built

   of justifying grace;

   The law, that shows the sinner's guilt,

   condemns him to his face.


   Jesus! how glorious is thy grace!

   when in thy name we trust,

   Our faith receives a righteousness

   that makes the sinner just.

   And shall we then go on to sin,

   that grace may more abound?

   Great God, forbid that such a thought

   should in our breast be found!


   When to the sacred font we came,

   did not the rite proclaim,

   That, washed from sin, and all its stains,

   new creatures we became?


   With Christ the Lord we died to sin;

   with him to life we rise,

   To life, which now begun on earth,

   is perfect in the skies.


   Too long enthralled to Satan's sway,

   we now are slaves no more;

   For Christ hath vanquished death and sin,

   our freedom to restore.

Romans 8:31, to the end

   8,6,8,6


   Let Christian faith and hope dispel

   the fears of guilt and woe;

   The Lord Almighty is our friend,

   and who can prove a foe?


   He who his Son, most dear and loved,

   gave up for us to die.

   Shall he not all things freely give

   that goodness can supply?


   Behold the best, the greatest gift,

   of everlasting love!

   Behold the pledge of peace below,

   and perfect bliss above!


   Where is the judge who can condemn,

   since God hath justified?

   Who shall charge those with guilt or crime

   for whom the Saviour died?


   The Saviour died, but rose again

   triumphant from the grave;

   And pleads our cause at God's right hand,

   omnipotent to save.


   Who then can e'er divide us more

   from Jesus and his love,

   Or break the sacred chain that binds

   the earth to heav'n above?


   Let troubles rise, and terrors frown,

   and days of darkness fall;

   Through him all dangers we'll defy,

   and more than conquer all.


   Nor death nor life, nor earth nor hell,

   nor time's destroying sway,

   Can e'er efface us from his heart,

   or make his love decay.


   Each future period that will bless,

   as it has bless'd the past;

   He loved us from the first of time,

   he loves us to the last.

   8,6,8,6


   Though perfect eloquence adorned

   my sweet persuading tongue,

   Though I could speak in higher strains

   than ever angel sung;


   Though prophecy my soul inspired,

   and made all myst'ries plain:

   Yet, were I void of Christian love,

   these gifts were all in vain.


   Nay, though my faith with boundless pow'r

   ev'n mountains could remove

   I still am nothing, if I'm void

   of charity and love.


   Although with lib'ral hand I gave

   my goods the poor to feed,

   Nay, gave my body to the flames,

   still fruitless were the deed.


   Love suffers long; love envies not;

   but love is ever kind;

   She never boasteth of herself,

   nor proudly lifts the mind.


   Love harbours no suspicious thought,

   is patient to the bad;

   Grieved when she hears of sins and crimes,

   and in the truth is glad.


   Love no unseemly carriage shows,

   nor selfishly confined;

   She glows with social tenderness,

   and feels for all mankind.


   Love beareth much, much she believes,

   and still she hopes the best;

   Love meekly suffers many a wrong,

   though sore with hardship pressed.


   Love still shall hold an endless reign

   in earth and heav'n above,

   When tongues shall cease, and prophets fail,

   and ev'ry gift but love.


   Here all our gifts imperfect are;

   but better days draw nigh,

   When perfect light shall pour its rays,

   and all those shadows fly.


   Like children here we speak and think,

   amused with childish toys;

   But when our pow'rs their manhood reach,

   we'll scorn our present joys.


   Now dark and dim, as through a glass,

   are God and truth beheld;

   Then shall we see as face to face,

   and God shall be unvailed.


   Faith, Hope, and Love, now dwell on earth,

   and earth by them is blest;

   But Faith and Hope must yield to Love,

   of all the graces best.


   Hope shall to full fruition rise,

   and Faith be sight above:

   These are the means, but this the end;

   for saints for ever love.

   8,6,8,6


   When the last trumpet's awful voice

   this rending earth shall shake,

   When op'ning graves shall yield their charge,

   and dust to life awake;


   Those bodies that corrupted fell

   shall incorrupted rise,

   And mortal forms shall spring to life

   immortal in the skies.


   Behold what heav'nly prophets sung

   is now at last fulfilled

   That Death should yield his ancient reign,

   and, vanquished, quit the field.


   Let Faith exalt her joyful voice,

   and thus begin to sing;

   O Grave! where is thy triumph now?

   and where, O Death! thy sting?


   Thy sting was sin, and conscious guilt,

   'twas this that armed thy dart;

   The law gave sin its strength and force

   to pierce the sinner's heart:


   But God, whose name be ever bless'd!

   disarms that foe we dread,

   And makes us conqu'rors when we die,

   through Christ our living head.


   Then stedfast let us still remain,

   though dangers rise around,

   And in the work prescribed by God

   yet more and more abound;


   Assured that though we labour now,

   we labour not in vain,

   But, through the grace of heav'n's great Lord,

   th' eternal crown shall gain.

   Soon shall this earthly frame, dissolved,

   in death and ruins lie;

   But better mansions wait the just,

   prepared above the sky.


   An house eternal, built by God,

   shall lodge the holy mind,

   When once those prison-walIs have fall'n

   by which tis now confined.


   Hence, burdened with a weight of clay,

   we groan beneath the load,

   Waiting the hour which sets us free,

   and brings us home to God.


   We know, that when the soul, unclothed,

   shall from this body fly,

   'Twill animate a purer frame

   with life that cannot die.


   Such are the hopes that cheer the just;

   these hopes their God hath giv'n;

   His Spirit is the earnest now,

   and seals their souls for heav'n.


   We walk by faith of joys to come,

   faith grounded on his word;

   But while this body is our home,

   we mourn an absent Lord.


   What faith rejoices to believe,

   we long and pant to see;

   we would be absent from the flesh,

   and present, Lord! with thee.


   But still, or here, or going hence,

   to this our labours tend,

   That, in his service spent, our life

   may in his favour end.


   For, lo! before the Son, as judge,

   th' assembled world shall stand,

   To take the punishment or prize

   from his unerring hand.


   Impartial retributions then

   our diff'rent lives await;

   Our present actions, good or bad,

   shall fix our future fate.

Philip. 2:6-12

   Ye who the name of Jesus bear,

   his sacred steps pursue;

   And let that mind which was in him

   be also found in you.


   Though in the form of God he was,

   his only Son declared,

   Nor to be equally adored

   as robb'ry did regard;


   His greatness he for us abased,

   for us his glory vailed;

   In human likeness dwelt on earth,

   his majesty concealed:


   Nor only as a man appears,

   but stoops a servant low;

   Submits to death, nay, bears the cross,

   in all its shame and woe.


   Hence God this gen'rous love to men

   with honours just hath crowned,

   And raised the name of Jesus far

   above all names renowned:


   That at this name, with sacred awe,

   each humble knee should bow

   Of hosts immortal in the skies,

   and nations spread below:


   That all the prostrate pow'rs of hell

   might tremble at his word,

   And ev'ry tribe, and ev'ry tongue,

   confess that he is Lord.

1 Thessal. 4:13, to the end

   Take comfort, Christians, when your friends

   in Jesus fall asleep;

   Their better being never ends;

   why then dejected weep?


   Why inconsolable, as those

   to whom no hope is giv'n?

   Death is the messenger of peace,

   and calls the soul to heav'n.


   As Jesus died, and rose again

   victorious from the dead;

   So his disciples rise, and reign

   with their triumphant Head.


   The time draws nigh, when from the clouds

   Christ shall with shouts descend,

   And the last trumpet's awful voice

   the heav'ns and earth shall rend.


   Then they who live shall changed be,

   and they who sleep shall wake;

   The graves shall yield their ancient charge,

   and earth's foundations shake.


   The saints of God, from death set free,

   with joy shall mount on high;

   The heav'nly hosts with praises loud

   shall meet them in the sky,


   Together to their Father's house

   with joyful hearts they go;

   And dwell for ever with the Lord,

   beyond the reach of woe.


   A few short years of evil past,

   we reach the happy shore,

   where death-divided friends at last

   shall meet, to part no more.

   Jesus, my Lord! I know his name,

   nor let my hope be lost.


   I know that safe with him remains,

   protectedby his pow'r,

   What I've committed to his trust,

   How wretched was our former state,

   when, slaves to Satan's sway,

   With hearts disordered and impure,

   o'erwhelmed in sin we lay!


   But, O my soul! for ever praise,

   for ever love his name,

   Who turned thee from the fatal paths

   of folly, sin, and shame.


   Vain and presumptuous is the trust

   which in our works we place,

   Salvation from a higher source

   flows to the human race.


   'Tis from the mercy of our God

   that all our hopes begin;

   His mercy saved our souls from death,

   and washed our souls from sin.


   His Spirit, through the Saviour shed,

   its sacred fire imparts,

   Refines our dross, and Love divine

   rekindles in our hearts.


   Thence raised from death, we live anew;

   and, justified by grace,

   We hope in glory to appear,

   and see our Father's face.


   Let all who hold this faith and hope

   in holy deeds abound;

   Thus faith approves itself sincere,

Heb. 4:14, to the end

   8,6,8,6


   Jesus, the Son of God, who once

   for us his life resigned,

   Now lives in heav'n, our great High Priest,

   and never-dying friend.


   Through life, through death, let us to him

   with constancy adhere;

   Faith shall supply new strength, and hope

   shall banish ev'ry ear.


   To human weakness not severe

   is our High Priest above;

   His heart o'erflows with tenderness,

   his bowels melt with love.


   With sympathetic feelings touched,

   he knows our feeble frame;

   He knows what sore temptations are,

   for he has felt the same.


   But though he felt temptation's pow'r,

   unconquered he remained;

   Nor, midst the frailty of our frame,

   by sin was ever stained.


   As, in the days of feeble flesh,

   he poured forth cries and tears;

   So, though exalted, still he feels

   what ev'ry Christian bears.


   Then let us, with a filial heart,

   come boldly to the throne

   Of grace supreme, to tell our griefs,

   and all our wants make known:


   That mercy we may there obtain

   for sins and errors past,

   And grace to help in time of need,

   while days of trial last.

Another version of the same Passage

   8,8,8,8


   Where high the heav'nly temple stands,

   The house of God not made with hands,

   A great High Priest our nature wears,

   The guardian of mankind appears.


   He who for men their surety stood,

   And poured on earth his precious blood,

   Pursues in heav'n his mighty plan,

   The Saviour and the friend of man.


   Though now ascended up on high,

   He bends on earth a brother's eye;

   Partaker of the human name,

   He knows the frailty of our frame.


   Our fellow-suff'rer yet retains

   A fellow-feeling of our pains;

   And still remembers in the skies

   His tears, his agonies, and cries.


   In ev'ry pang that tends the heart,

   The Man of sorrows had a part;

   He sympathizes with our grief,

   And to the suff'rer sends relief.


   With boldness, therefore, at the throne,

   Let us make all our sorrows known;

   And ask the aids of heav'nly pow'r

   To help us in the evil hour.

Heb. 12:1-13

   8,6,8,6


   Behold what witnesses unseen

   encompass us around;

   Men, once like us, with suff'ring tried,

   but now with glory crowned.


   Let us, with zeal like theirs inspired,

   begin the Christian race,

   And, freed from each encumb'ring weight,

   their holy footsteps trace.


   Behold a witness nobler still,

   who trod affliction's path,

   Jesus, at once the finisher

   and author of our faith.


   He for the joy before him set,

   so gen'rous was his love,

   Endured the cross, despised the shame,

   and now he reigns above.


   If he the scorn of wicked men

   with patience did sustain,

   Becomes it those for whom he died

   to murmur or complain?


   Have ye like him to blood, to death,

   the cause of truth maintained?

   And is your heav'nly Father's voice

   forgotten or disdained?


   My son, saith he, with patient mind

   endure the chast'ning rod;

   Believe, when by afflictions tried,

   that thou art loved by God.


   His children thus most dear to him

   their heav'nly Father trains,

   Through all the hard experience led

   of sorrows and of pains.


   We know he owns us for his sons,

   when we correction share;

   Nor wander as a bastard race,

   without our Father's care.


   A father's voice with rev'rence we

   on earth have often heard;

   The Father of our spirits now

   demands the same regard.


   Parents may err; but he is wise,

   nor lifts the rod in vain

   His chast'nings serve to cure the soul

   by salutary pain.


   Affliction, when it spreads around,

   may seem a field of woe;

   Yet there, at last, the happy fruits

   of righteousness shall grow.


   Then let our hearts no more despond,

   our hands be weak no more;

   Still let us trust our Father's love,

   his wisdom still adore.

   O may thy Spirit seal our souls,

2 Pet. 3:3-14

   8,6,8,6


   Lo! in the last of days behold

   a faithless race arise;

   Their lawless lust their only rule;

   and thus the scoffer cries;


   Where is the promise, deemed so true,

   that spoke the Saviour near?

   E'er since our fathers slept in dust,

   no change has reached our ear.


   Years rolled on years successive glide,

   since first the world began,

   And on the tide of time still floats,

   secure, the bark of man.


   Thus speaks the scoffer; but his words

   conceal the truth he knows,

   That from the waters' dark abyss

   the earth at first arose.


   But when the sons of men began

   with one consent to stray,

   At Heav'n's command a deluge swept

   the godless race away.


   A diff'rent fate is now prepared

   for Nature's trembling frame;

   Soon shall her orbs be all enwrapt

   in one devouring flame.


   Reserved are sinners for the hour

   when to the gulf below,

   Armed with the hand of sov'reign pow'r,

   the judge consigns his foe.


   Though now, ye just! the time appears

   protracted, dark, unknown,

   An hour, a day, a thousand years,

   to heav'n's great Lord are one.


   Still all may share his sov'reign grace,

   in ev'ry change secure;

   The meek, the suppliant contrite race,

   shall find his mercy sure.


   The contrite race he counts his friends

   forbids the suppliant's fall;

   Condemns reluctant, but extends

   the hope of grace to all.


   Yet as the night-wrapped thief who lurks

   to seize th' expected prize,

   Thus steals the hour when Christ shall come,

   and thunder rend the skies.


   Then at the loud, the solemn peal,

   the heav'ns shall burst away;

   The elements shall melt in flame,

   at Nature's final day.


   Since all this frame of things must end,

   as Heav'n has so decreed,

   How wise our inmost thoughts to guard,

   and watch o'er ev'ry deed;


   Expecting calm th' appointed hour,

   when, Nature's conflict o'er,

   A new and better world shall rise,

   where sin is known no more.

   High is the rank we now possess;

   but higher we shall rise;

   Though what we shall hereafter be

   is hid from mortal eyes:


   Our souls, we know, when he appears,

   shall bear his image bright;

   For all his glory, full disclosed,

   shall open to our sight.


   A hope so great, and so divine,

   may trials well endure;

   And purge the soul from sense and sin,

   as Christ himself is pure.

Rev. 1:5-9

   8,6,8,6


   To him that loved the souls of men

   and washed us in his blood,

   To royal honours raised our head,

   and made us priests to God;


   To him let ev'ry tongue be praise,

   and ev'ry heart be love!

   All grateful honours paid on earth,

   and nobler songs above!


   Behold, on flying clouds he comes!

   his saints shall bless the day;

   While they that pierced him sadly mourn

   in anguish and dismay,


   I am the First, and I the Last;

   time centres all in me;

   Th' Almighty God, who was, and is,

   and evermore shall be.

Rev. 5:6, to the end.

   8,6,8,6


   Behold the glories of the Lamb

   amidst his Father's throne;

   Prepare new honours for his name,

   and songs before unknown.


   Lo! elders worship at his feet;

   the church adores around,

   With vials full of odours rich,

   and harps of sweetest sound.


   These odours are the pray'rs of saints,

   these sounds the hymns they raise;

   God bends his ear to their requests,

   he loves to hear their praise.


   Who shall the Father's record search,

   and hidden things reveal?

   Behold the Son that record takes,

   and opens ev'ry seal.


   Hark how th' adoring hosts above

   with songs surround the throne!

   Ten thousand thousand are their tongues;

   but all their hearts are one.


   Worthy the Lamb that died, they cry,

   to be exalted thus;

   Worthy the Lamb, let us reply,

   for he was slain for us.


   To him be pow'r divine ascribed,

   and endless blessings paid;

   Salvation, glory, joy, remain

   for ever on his head!


   Thou hast redeemed us with thy blood,

   and set the pris'ners free;

   Thou mad'st us kings and priests to God,

   and we shall reign with thee.


   From ev'ry kindred, ev'ry tongue,

   thou brought'st thy chosen race;

   And distant lands and isles have shared

   the riches of thy grace.


   Let all that dwell above the sky,

   or on the earth below,

   With fields, and floods, and ocean's shores,

   to thee their homage show.


   To Him who sits upon the throne,

   the God whom we adore,

   And to the Lamb that once was slain,

   be glory evermore.

Rev. 7:13, to the end

   8,6,8,6


   How bright these glorious spirits shine!

   whence all their white array?

   How came they to the blissful seats

   of everlasting day?


   Lo! these are they from suff'rings great,

   who came to realms of light,

   And in the blood of Christ have washed

   those robes which shine so bright.


   Now, with triumphal palms, they stand

   before the throne on high,

   And serve the God they love, amidst

   the glories of the sky.


   His presence fills each heart with joy,

   tunes ev'ry mouth to sing:

   By day, by night, the sacred courts

   with glad hosannahs ring.


   Hunger and thirst are felt no more,

   nor suns with scorching ray;

   God is their sun, whose cheering beams

   diffuse eternal day.


   The Lamb which dwells amidst the throne

   shall o'er them still preside;

   Feed them with nourishment divine,

   and all their footsteps guide.


   'Mong pastures green he'll lead his flock,

   where living streams appear;

   And God the Lord from ev'ry eye

   shall wipe off ev'ry tear.

Rev. 21:1-9

   8,6,8,6


   Lo! what a glorious sight appears

   to our admiring eyes!

   The former seas have passed away,

   the former earth and skies.


   From heav'n the New Jerus'lem comes,

   all worthy of its Lord;

   See all things now at last renewed,

   and paradise restored!


   Attending angels shout for joy,

   and the bright armies sing;

   Mortals! behold the sacred seat

   of your descending King!


   The God of glory down to men

   removes his bless'd abode;

   He dwells with men; his people they,

   and he his people's God.


   His gracious hand shall wipe the tears

   from ev'ry weeping eye:

   And pains and groans, and griefs and fears,

   and death itself, shall die.


   Behold, I change all human things!

   saith he, whose words are true;

   Lo! what was old is passed away,

   and all things are made new!


   I am the First, and I the Last,

   through endless years the same;

   I AM, is my memorial still,

   and my eternal name.


   Ho, ye that thirst! to you my grace

   shall hidden streams disclose,

   And open full the sacred spring,

   whence life for ever flows.


   Bless'd is the man that overcomes;

   I'll own him for a son;

   A rich inheritance rewards

   the conquests he hath won.


   But bloody hands and hearts unclean,

   and all the lying race,

   The faithless, and the scoffing crew,

   who spurn at offered grace;


   They, seized by justice, shall be doomed

   in dark abyss to lie,

   And in the fiery burning lake

   the second death shall die.


   O may we stand before the Lamb,

   when earth and seas are fled,

   And hear the judge pronounce our name,

   with blessings on our bead!

HYMN 1

   Joseph Addison

   8,6,8,6


   When all thy mercies, O my God!

   my rising soul surveys

   Transported with the view, I'm lost

   in wonder, love, and praise.


   O how shall words, with equal warmth,

   the gratitude declare

   That glows within my ravished heart!

   but Thou canst read it there.


   Thy Providence my life sustained,

   and all my wants redrest,

   When in the silent womb I lay,

   and hung upon the breast.


   To all my weak complaints and cries

   thy mercy lent an ear,

   Ere yet my feeble thoughts had learned

   to form themselves in pray'r.


   Unnumbered comforts to my soul

   thy tender care bestowed,

   Before my infant heart conceived

   from whom these comforts flowed.


   When in the slipp'ry paths of youth

   with heedless steps I ran,

   Thine arm, unseen, conveyed me safe,

   and led me up to man:


   Through hidden dangers, toils, and deaths,

   it gently cleared my way;

   And through the pleasing snares of vice,

   more to be feared than they.


   When worn with sickness, oft hast thou

   with health renewed my face;

   And, when in sins and sorrows sunk,

   revived my soul with grace.


   Thy bounteous hand with worldly bliss

   hath made my cup run o'er;

   And, in a kind and faithful friend,

   hath doubled all my store.


   Ten thousand thousand precious gifts

   my daily thanks employ;

   Nor is the least a cheerful heart,

   that tastes these gifts with joy.


   Through ev'ry period of my life

   thy goodness I'll proclaim;

   And after death, in distant worlds,

   resume the glorious theme.


   When nature fails, and day and night

   divide thy works no more,

   My ever grateful heart, O Lord,

   thy mercy shall adore.


   Through all eternity to thee

   a joyful song I'll raise;

   For, oh! eternity's too short

   to utter all thy praise.
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN 2
Psalm 19:1-6

   Joseph Addison

   8,8,8,8


   The spacious firmament on high,

   With all the blue ethereal sky,

   And spangled heav'ns, a shining frame,

   Their great Original proclaim.


   Th' unwearied sun, from day to day,

   Does his Creator's pow'r display;

   And publishes to ev'ry land

   The work of an Almighty hand.


   Soon as the ev'ning shades prevail,

   The moon takes up the wondrous tale.

   And, nightly to the list'ning earth,

   Repeats the story of her birth;


   While all the stars that round her burn,

   And all the planets in their turn

   Confirm the tidings as they roll,

   And spread the truth from pole to pole.


   What though in solemn silence all

   Move round the dark terrestrial ball?

   What though no real voice, nor sound,

   Amidst their radiant orbs be found?


   In Reason's ear they all rejoice,

   And utter forth a glorious voice;

   For ever singing, as they shine:

   'The hand that made us is divine.'
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN 3

   Joseph Addison

   8,6,8,6


   When rising from the bed of death,

   o'erwhelmed with guilt and fear,

   I see my Maker face to face,

   O how shall I appear!


   If yet while pardon may be found,

   and mercy may be sought,

   My heart with inward horror shrinks,

   and trembles at the thought;


   When thou, O Lord! shalt stand disclosed

   in majesty severe,

   And sit in judgment on my soul,

   O how shall I appear!


   But thou hast told the troubled mind,

   who doth her sins lament,

   That timely grief for errors past

   shall future woe prevent.


   Then see the sorrows of my heart,

   ere yet it be too late;

   And hear my Saviour's dying groans,

   to give those sorrows weight.


   For never shall my soul despair

   of mercy at thy throne,

   Who knows thine only Son has died

   thy justice to atone.
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN 4

   Isaac Watts

   8,6,8,6


   Blest morning! whose first dawning rays

   beheld the Son of God

   Arise triumphant from the grave,

   and leave his dark abode.


   Wrapt in the silence of the tomb,

   the great Redeemer lay,

   Till the revolving skies had brought

   the third, th' appointed day.


   Hell and the grave combined their force

   to hold our Lord in vain;

   Sudden the Conqueror arose,

   and burst their feeble chain.


   To thy great name, Almighty Lord!

   we sacred honours pay,

   And loud hosannahs shall proclaim

   the triumphs of the day.


   Salvation and immortal praise

   to our victorious King!

   Let heav'n and earth, and rocks and seas,

   with glad hosannahs ring.


   To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

   the God whom we adore,

   Be glory, as it was, and is,

   and shall be evermore.
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN 5

   8,8,8,8


   The hour of my departure's come;

   I hear the voice that calls me home:

   At last, O Lord! let trouble cease.

   And let thy servant die in peace.


   The race appointed I have run;

   The combat's o'er, the prize is won;

   And now my witness is on high,

   And now my record's in the sky.


   Not in mine innocence I trust;

   I bow before thee in the dust;

   And through my Saviour's blood alone

   I look for mercy at thy throne.


   I leave the world without a tear,

   Save for the friends I held so dear;

   To heal their sorrows, Lord, descend,

   And to the friendless prove a friend.


   I come, I come, at thy command,

   I give my spirit to thy hand;

   stretch forth thine everlasting arms,

   And shield me in the last alarms.


   The hour of my departure's come;

   I hear the voice that calls me home;

   Now, O my God! let trouble cease;

   Now let thy servant die in peace.
