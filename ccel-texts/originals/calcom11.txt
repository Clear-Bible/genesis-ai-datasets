   PSALM 93

   The psalm commences with the celebration of the infinite glory of God.
   It is then declared that such is his faithfulness that he never
   deceives his own people, who, embracing his promises, wait with
   tranquil minds for their salvation amidst all the tempests and
   agitations of the world.

   Psalm 93:1-2

   1. Jehovah hath reigned, he hath clothed himself with majesty: [1]
   Jehovah hath clothed himself with strength, he hath girded himself: [2]
   he hath also established the world, it shall not be moved. 2. Thy
   throne is stable; [3] from then, from everlasting art thou.


   1 Jehovah hath reigned We here see what I have lately adverted to, that
   in the power of God there is exhibited to us matter of confidence; for
   our not investing God with the power which belongs to him, as we ought
   to do, and thus wickedly despoiling him of his authority, is the source
   of that fear and trembling which we very often experience. This, it is
   true, we dare not do openly, but were we well persuaded of his
   invincible power, that would be to us an invincible support against all
   the assaults of temptation. All admit in word what the prophet here
   teaches, That God reigns; but how few are there who oppose this shield
   to the hostile powers of the world, as it becomes them to do, that they
   may fear nothing however terrible? In this then consists the glory of
   God, that he governs mankind according to his will. It is said that he
   clothes himself with majesty and strength; not that we ought to imagine
   that there is any thing in him which is derived from another, but it is
   intended by the effect and indubitable experience to show his wisdom
   and righteousness in the government of mankind. The Psalmist proves
   that God will not neglect or abandon the world, from the fact that he
   created it. A simple survey of the world should of itself suffice to
   attest a Divine Providence. The heavens revolve daily, and, immense as
   is their fabric, and inconceivable the rapidity of their revolutions,
   we experience no concussion -- no disturbance in the harmony of their
   motion. The sun, though varying its course every diurnal revolution,
   returns annually to the same point. The planets, in all their
   wanderings, maintain their respective positions. How could the earth
   hang suspended in the air were it not upheld by God's hand? By what
   means could it maintain itself unmoved, while the heavens above are in
   constant rapid motion, did not its Divine Maker fix and establish it?
   Accordingly the particle 'ph, aph, denoting emphasis, is introduced --
   Yea, he hath established it.

   2 Thy throne is stable Some read, is prepared, and this agrees well
   with the context. provided we take the two clauses as one sentence,
   meaning -- O Lord, as thou art from eternity, even so thy throne is
   erected or prepared from that time For the sense which some have
   attached to the words, as if they contained a simple assertion of God's
   eternity, is poor; and the Psalmist evidently intends to say that as
   God is eternal in essence, so he has always been invested with power
   and majesty. The term throne signifies, by the figure synecdoche,
   righteousness, and office or power of government; it being customary to
   transfer such images taken from men to God, in accommodation to our
   infirmity. [4] By this ascription of praise the Psalmist effectually
   disposes of all the absurd ideas which have been broached, tending to
   deny or disparage the power of God, and declares, upon the matter, that
   God may sooner cease to be, than to sit upon his throne in the
   government of this world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] Horsley translates, -- "Jehovah is King,
   Jehovah is gorgeously arrayed." And, on the second line, he has the
   following note: -- "The construction of the original is doubtful,
   though the sense be obvious. The text may be expounded in either of
   these two ways; yhvh (Jehovah) lvs (hath put on) g'vt lvs (majesty of
   dress;) or, g'vt lvs (majesty of dress) [is] lvs (the dress) yhvh (of
   Jehovah.)"

   [2] See [2]volume 2, page 455, note 2. Bishop Lowth supposes that here,
   as well as in that passage, there is an allusion to the precious and
   magnificent ornaments of the priests' attire. "Such," says he, "was the
   gracefulness, such the magnificence of the sacerdotal vestments,
   especially those of the High Priest; so adapted were they, as Moses
   says, (Exodus 28:2,) to the expression of glory and beauty, that to
   those who were impressed with an equal opinion of the sanctity of the
   wearer, nothing could possibly appear more venerable and sublime. To
   these, therefore, we find frequent allusions in the Hebrew poets, when
   they have occasion to describe extraordinary beauty or comeliness, or
   to delineate the perfect form of supreme Majesty. The elegant Isaiah
   (Isaiah 61:10) has a most beautiful idea of this kind when he
   describes, in his own peculiar manner, (that is, most magnificently,)
   the exultation and glory of the Church, after its triumphal
   restoration. Pursuing the allusion, he decorates her with the vestments
   of salvation, and clothes her in a robe of righteousness. He afterwards
   compares the Church to a bridegroom dressed for the marriage, to which
   comparison incredible dignity is added by the word Ikohen, a metaphor
   plainly taken from the apparel of the priests, the force of which,
   therefore, no modern language can express. No imagery, indeed, which
   the Hebrew writers could employ, was equally adapted with this to the
   display (as far as the human powers can conceive or depict the subject)
   of the infinite majesty of God, Jehovah' is therefore introduced by the
   Psalmist as clothed with glory and with strength,' (Psalm 93:1,) he is
   girded with power,' (Psalm 65:7;) which are the very terms appropriated
   to the describing of the dress and ornaments of the priests." --

   Psalm 93:3-5

   3. The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah! the floods have lifted up
   their voice; the floods shall lift up their waves. 4. The waves [5] of
   the sea are terrible, by reason of the noise of great waters, Jehovah
   is terrible above. 5. Thy testimonies are singularly true: holiness is
   the glory of thy house, O Jehovah! for length of days. [6]


   3 The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah! Various meanings have been
   attached to this verse. Some think there is an allusion to the violent
   assaults made upon the Church by her enemies, and the goodness of God
   seen in restraining them. [7] Others are of opinion that the words
   should be taken literally, and not figuratively, in this sense --
   Though the noise of many waters be terrible, and the waves of the sea
   more fearful still, God is more terrible than all. I would not be
   inclined to insist too nicely upon any comparison that may have been
   intended. I have no doubt the Psalmist sets forth the power of God by
   adducing one brief illustration out of many which might have been
   given, [8] Intimating that we need not go farther for a striking
   instance of Divine power -- one that may impress us with an idea of his
   tremendous majesty -- than to the floods of waters, and agitations of
   the ocean; as in Psalm 29:4, the mighty voice of God is said to be in
   the thunder. God manifests his power in the sound of the floods, and in
   the tempestuous waves of the sea, in a way calculated to excite our
   reverential awe. Should it be thought that there is a comparison
   intended, then the latter clause of the verse must be understood as
   added, with this meaning, That all the terror of the objects mentioned
   is as nothing when we come to consider the majesty of God himself, such
   as he is in heaven. There is still another sense which may be extracted
   from the words, That though the world may to appearance be shaken with
   violent commotions, this argues no defect in the government of God,
   since he can control them at once by his dreadful power.

   5 Thy testimonies [9] are singularly true As yet the Psalmist has
   insisted upon the excellency of God in the work of creation, and the
   providential government of the world. Now he speaks of his
   distinguishing goodness to his chosen people, in making known to them
   the doctrine which bringeth salvation. He begins by commending the
   absolute trust-worthiness and truthfulness of the law of God. This
   being a treasure which was not extended to all nations promiscuously,
   he adds immediately that the house of God would be adorned with a glory
   which should last for ever. The Divine goodness is displayed in every
   part of the world, but the Psalmist justly considers it as of all
   others the most inestimable blessing, that God should have deposited in
   his Church the covenant of eternal life, and made his glory principally
   to shine out of it. Some translate the Hebrew word n'vh, naävah,
   desirable, [10] as if the Psalmist had said that the adorning of the
   temple was precious; but the grammatical construction will not admit of
   this. By length of days is meant perpetual succession, [11] and to this
   we find Isaiah referring in striking terms, that the Divine truth might
   be preserved in faithful custody through successive ages.

   "Behold, I have put my word in thy mouth, in the mouth of thy seed, and
   of thy seed's seed," (Isaiah 59:21.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] The Hebrew word msvry, mishberey, here used for waves, means
   "waves" that "beat" against the shore or each other, and so are
   "broken," -- "breakers." Accordingly, Mant translates, "Strong the
   breakers tossing high." Horsley gives a similar version. He reads the
   third and fourth verses thus, -- 3. "The floods, O Jehovah! Raised
   The floods raised their voice;
   The floods lifted up their waves,
   With the sound of many waters.
   4. Mighty are the breakers of the seal;
   Mighty on High is Jehovah!" As to the fourth line, "With the sound of
   many waters," he observes, "This is the first line of the fourth, but
   should be joined to the third verse. And are not the floods here
   mentioned, the fluids of the indigested chaos, in wild irregular
   agitation, before the Creator had reduced it to form and order? Or
   rather, may they not be mystical, -- the tumults of the rebellious
   people?"

   [6] "Domui tuae decus, sanctitas Jehovah in longitudinum dierum." --
   Lat. The translation in the French version is different, -- "A ta
   maison est donc magnificence: la sainctete du Seigneur est pour un long
   temps." "To thy house then there is glory: the holiness of the Lord is
   for a length of time." In the former version, holiness is represented
   to be the true glory and ornament of God's house; in the latter, it is
   described as the attribute of God.

   [7] Dr Morison, after stating the opinion of Mudge, who thinks that
   this psalm was composed on occasion of some violent inundation, which
   threatened a general confusion to the world, adds, "It is more
   probable, perhaps, that the floods spoken of are entirely figurative;
   and that they represent in Eastern phrase, those powerful enemies by
   whom the peace of David and the ancient Church was so often disturbed.
   But though the floods were lifted high, and threatened destruction to
   those who were within their reach, yet Jehovah was seen, as it were,
   riding on their most tempestuous billows, and amidst their mightiest
   tumult, his throne was unshaken and his kingdom unmoved." In support of
   this view he refers to other passages of Scripture, as Isaiah 8:7, 8;
   17:12, 13; and Job 46:7, 8, [sic] where the confederated enemies of
   God's Church are compared to the tempestuous waves of the mighty ocean,
   which roll one after another with resistless fury upon the storm-tossed
   bark.

   [8] "Non dubito quin Propheta quasi per hypotyposin Dei potentiam hic
   nobis exprimat." -- Lat. "Comme par une demonstration." -- Fr.
   Hypotyposis means strictly the first rough sketch of a picture.

   [9] "The testimonies of God, when taken generally, are the truths which
   he has testified or declared, inclusive not only of moral precepts, but
   of gracious and unchangeable promises. The combined result of which is,
   to impress on the minds of men the weighty consideration, that those
   who trust in the mercy of God must not, in a lower degree, venerate and
   adore his sanctity in all their converse with him." -- Walford.

   [10] "Quidam, n'vh, pro desiderabili accipiunt: acsi dixisset propheta,
   Templi decus esse pretiosum," etc. -- Lat. The French version follows
   this exactly. But the sentence is unsatisfactory; and there would seem
   to be some mistake, or omission, in the original text. If the Hebrew
   word referred to be rendered desirable, then when joined to qds, the
   clause would read, holiness is desirable, or becoming, to thy house,
   etc. -- and not the adorning of thy house is desirable, or precious

   [11] "Holiness becometh thine house -- for ever,' l'rk ymym, le-orec
   yamim, for length of days:' during the whole lapse of time; till the
   sun and moon shall be no more." -- Dr Adam Clarke

   PSALM 94

   The Psalmist implores Divine assistance against wicked and violent men,
   who persecuted the upright in a cruel and tyrannical manner. It is
   evident that he refers to domestic foes, whose unrighteous domination
   was as vexatious and oppressive to the Lord's people, as all the
   injuries received from the Gentile nations without.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 94:1-6

   1. O Jehovah! God of vengeances; God of vengeances, [12] shine forth.
   [13] 2. Lift up thyself, thou Judge of the earth! render a reward to
   the proud. 3. O Jehovah! how long shall the wicked -- how long shall
   the wicked triumph? 4. They pour forth, they speak hard things, all the
   workers of iniquity lift up themselves. 5. They break in pieces thy
   people, O Jehovah! and afflict thy inheritance. 6. They slay the widow,
   and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.


   1 O Jehovah! God of vengeances We know that the Jews were surrounded by
   many neighbors who were not well affected towards them, and were thus
   incessantly subject to the assaults and oppression of bitter enemies.
   As this intestine persecution was even more afflictive than the rampant
   and unrestrained violence of the wicked, we need not wonder that the
   Psalmist should earnestly beseech God for deliverance from it. The
   expressions which he uses, calling upon God to shine forth
   conspicuously, and lift himself up on high, amount in common language
   to this, that God would give some actual manifestation of his character
   as judge or avenger; for in that case he is seen ascending his tribunal
   to exact the punishment due to sin, and demonstrate his power in
   preserving order and government in the world. The phraseology is used
   only in reference to ourselves, disposed as we are to feel as if he
   overlooked us, unless he stretched out his hand to help us in some
   visible and open manner. In calling him twice successively the God of
   vengeances, and then, judge of the earth, the Psalmist uses these
   titles as applicable to the present situation in which he stood,
   reminding Him in a manner of the office which belonged to him, and
   saying -- O Lord! it is thine to take vengeance upon sinners, and judge
   the earth -- see how they take advantage of the impunity which is
   extended to their guilt, and triumph audaciously in their wickedness!
   Not that God needs to be admonished of his duty, for he never resigns
   himself to indifference, and even when he seems to delay his judgments,
   is only adjusting them according to what he knows to be the best
   season; but his people conceive of him in this way to themselves, and
   take occasion from this to embolden and stimulate themselves to greater
   vehemency in prayer. [14] The same may be said of the repetition which
   the Psalmist uses. When the wicked then indulge in unrestrained
   excesses, we are to remember that God can never cease to assert his
   character as the judge of the earth who takes vengeance upon iniquity.
   Does he seem in our carnal apprehension to have at any time withdrawn
   and hidden himself? let us put up without hesitation the prayer which
   is here taught us by the Holy Spirit, that he would shine forth

   3 O Jehovah! how long shall the wicked? The Psalmist justifies himself
   in this verse for the fervent importunity which he showed in prayer.
   There was need of immediate help, when the wicked had proceeded to such
   an extent of audacity. The necessity of our case may justly embolden us
   in our requests, which must be all the more readily heard as they are
   reasonable; and here the Psalmist insists that his complaints were not
   without cause, nor originated in trifling reasons, but were extorted by
   injuries of the most flagrant description. Notice is taken of the
   length of time during which their persecutions had lasted, as an
   aggravating circumstance. They had become hardened under the
   long-continued forbearance of God, and had in consequence contracted a
   shamelessness, as well as obstinacy of spirit, imagining that he looked
   upon their wickedness with an eye of favor. The term how long twice
   repeated, implies the extent of impunity which had been granted, that
   it was not as if they had newly started upon their career, but that
   they had been tolerated for a length of time, and had become
   outrageously flagitious. It was thus that in former times wicked men
   tyrannized to such a degree over the Church, while yet God did not
   interfere to apply a remedy; and we need not be surprised that he
   should subject her now to protracted persecutions, nor should we
   conclude that, because he does not immediately proceed to cure existing
   evils, he has utterly forsaken her. The term triumph denotes that
   fullness of audacious and boasting exultation which the wicked feel
   when they are intoxicated with continued prosperity, and conceive that
   they may indulge in every excess without restraint.

   4 They pour forth, they speak hard things [15] He shows in still
   clearer terms, how their fierceness in persecution was such that they
   did not scruple to glory in their guilt. The Hebrew verb nv, nabang,
   means more than to speak. Literally it signifies to rush or boil forth,
   and comes to denote figuratively the uttering of reckless or rash
   words. We see how wicked men are instigated by pride and vain-glory, to
   demean and disgrace themselves so far as to boast vain-gloriously of
   their power, breathing forth threatenings of bloodshed, violence, and
   monstrous cruelty. It is to such ebullitions that the Psalmist refers,
   when men who are lost to all sense of shame and modesty boast of the
   wickedness which they can perpetrate at will. This is what he means by
   their speaking hard things, uttering discourse which is under no
   restraint of fear, or prudential consideration, but which launches into
   the most unbridled license. As the Lord's people had formerly to endure
   the heavy trial of seeing the Church subjected to this wild tyranny and
   misrule, we should account it no strange thing to see the Church
   suffering still under miserable misgovernment, or positive oppression,
   but should pray for help from God, who, though he connives at
   wickedness for a time, eventually comes to the deliverance of his
   children.

   5 They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah! Having spoken of their
   discourse or language as vain-glorious and shameless, he proceeds to
   speak of their deeds, in cruelly persecuting the Church. It is hard
   that even the subjects of heathen princes should be subjected to unjust
   persecution, but a more intolerable thing still, that those who are
   God's own people, his peculiar inheritance, should be trampled under
   the foot of tyranny. The prayer before us is one which, as I have
   already remarked, is given with the intention that we should prefer it
   ourselves, when we or others may be persecuted by wicked men, and
   especially intestine enemies. Our safety is dear to the Lord, not only
   as we are men, the workmanship of his hand, but as we are his peculiar
   heritage; and this should lead us, when wronged at any time, to betake
   ourselves to God with the more confidence. It is farther added -- that
   they spare not the widow, and the orphan, and murder the stranger God,
   while he has commanded us in general to cultivate equity and justice in
   our common intercourse, has commended the orphan, widow, and stranger,
   to our peculiar care, as being more exposed to injury, and therefore
   more entitled to humanity and compassion. To treat such objects with
   cruelty argues a singular degree of impiety, and contempt of divine
   authority, and is not only an outrage of common justice, but the
   infraction of a privilege of special protection which God has
   condescended to cast around them. [16] They who are chargeable with
   such conduct, particularly provoke the divine anger. As to little
   children especially, their helplessness and tender age will even
   protect them from being attacked by dogs and wild beasts. And what
   shall we think of the monstrous inhumanity of men, who would make them
   the objects of their assault? We have here a specimen of the dreadful
   state of matters which must then have prevailed in the Church of God.
   The law was there, and the ordinances of divine appointment, yet we see
   to what an awful extent every species of wickedness abounded. Let us
   beware lest we fall into a similar state of corruption, and should it
   so happen under our own observation that men persecute the stranger,
   seize the widow, and rob the fatherless, let us, in imitation of the
   Psalmist, who would have us alleviate their misfortunes, pray God to
   undertake their defense.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] This is a literal translation of the original Hebrew, and
   Archbishop Secker thinks it is much more spirited than that of our
   English version. The word vengeance, when applied to God, means nothing
   more than his retributive justice. It may not be one of the happiest
   words for representing the Hebrew term when used to express this
   attribute of Deity, being liable to be misunderstood, as if it implied
   a revengeful spirit, the sense which it commonly bears when applied to
   men. "This retributive justice," says Dr Adam Clarke, "is what we often
   term vengeance, but perhaps improperly; for vengeance with us signifies
   an excitement of angry passions, in order to gratify a vindictive
   spirit, which supposes itself to have received some real injury;
   whereas, what is here referred to is the simple act of justice that
   gives to all their due."

   [13] Mant renders, "Beam forth with all thy radiance bright." "The
   Hebrew verb," he observes, "signifies to irradiate, shine forth, as God
   in glory; Psalm 80:1; 50:2; and that either in vengeance, as in this
   place, or kindness, as in Job 10:3." -- See Parkhurst's Lexicon on yph

   [14] "Mais les fideles s'arrestent a mediter ainsi en eux-mesmes la
   nature d'iceluy, afin de s'accourager, meilleure esperance, et
   soliciter a prier avec plus grande ardeur et vehemence." -- Fr.

   [15] In our English Bible this verse is put into the interrogative
   form, and the words "how long" are supplied: "How long shall they utter
   and speak hard things?" Calvin translates it as a simple statement, and
   without any supplemental words; which Archbishop Secker considers to be
   more correct.

   [16] "Non seulement le droict commun est viole, mais aussi le privilege
   que Dieu a voulu ordonner pour les maintenir en sauvete et seurete." --
   Fr.

   Psalm 94:7-10

   7. And they have said, God shall not see, the God of Jacob shall not
   know. 8. Understand, ye stupid [17] among the people: and ye fools,
   when will ye be wise? 9. He that planted [18] the ear, shall he not
   hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? 10. He that chastiseth
   the nations, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge. [19]


   7. And they have said, God shall not see When the Psalmist speaks of
   the wicked as taunting God with blindness and ignorance, we are not to
   conceive of them as just exactly entertaining this imagination of him
   in their hearts, but they despise his judgments as much as if he took
   no cognisance of human affairs. Were the truth graven upon men's hearts
   that they cannot elude the eye of God, this would serve as a check and
   restraint upon their conduct. When they proceed to such audacity in
   wickedness as to lay the hand of violence upon their fellow-creatures,
   to rob, and to destroy, it shows that they have fallen into a state of
   brutish security in which they virtually consider themselves as
   concealed from the view of the Almighty. This security sufficiently
   proves at least, that they act as if they never expected to be called
   to an account for their conduct. [20] Though they may not then be
   guilty of the gross blasphemy of asserting in so many words that God is
   ignorant of what goes forward in the world, a mere nothing in the
   universe -- the Psalmist very properly charges them with denying God's
   providential government, and, indeed, avowedly stripping him of the
   power and function of judge and governor, since, if they really were
   persuaded as they ought of his superintending providence, they would
   honor him by feeling a reverential fear -- as I have elsewhere observed
   at greater length. He intends to express the lowest and most abandoned
   stage of depravity, in which the sinner casts off the fear of God, and
   rushes into every excess. Such infatuated conduct would have been
   inexcusable even in heathens, who had never heard of a divine
   revelation; but it was monstrous in men who had been brought up from
   infancy in the knowledge of the word, to show such mockery and contempt
   of God.

   8 Understand, ye stupid among the people As it was execrable impiety to
   deny God to be Judge of the earth, the Psalmist severely reprimands
   their folly in thinking to elude his government, and even succeed by
   artifices in escaping his view. The expression, stupid among the
   people, is stronger than had he simply condemned them as foolish. It
   rendered their folly more inexcusable, that they belonged to the
   posterity of Abraham, of whom Moses said,

   "What people is there so great, who have their gods so near unto them,
   as the Lord thy God hath this day come down unto thee? For this is your
   understanding and wisdom before all nations, to have God for your
   legislator." (Deuteronomy 4:7)

   [21] Perhaps, however, he may be considered as addressing the rulers
   and those who were of higher rank in the community, and styling them
   degraded among the people, that is, no better than the common herd of
   the vulgar. Proud men, who are apt to be blinded by a sense of their
   importance, require to be brought down, and made to see that in God's
   estimation they are no better than others. He puts them on a level with
   the common people, to humble their self-complacency; or we may suppose
   that he hints with an ironical and sarcastic allusion to their boasted
   greatness, that they were distinguished above others chiefly for
   pre-eminent folly -- adding, at the same time, as an additional
   aggravation, that they were obstinate in their adherence to it; for as
   much is implied in the question, When will ye be wise? We might
   consider it an unnecessary assertion of Divine Providence to put the
   question to the wicked, Shall not he who made the ear hear? because
   there are none so abandoned as openly to deny God's cognisance of
   events; but, as I have observed above, the flagrant audacity and
   self-security which most men display in contradicting his will, is a
   sufficient proof that they have supplanted God from their imaginations,
   and substituted a mere dead idol in his place, since, did they really
   believe him to be cognisant of their actions, they would at least show
   as much regard to him as to their fellow-creatures, in whose presence
   they feel some measure of restraint, and are prevented from sinning by
   fear and respect. To arouse them from this stupidity, the Psalmist
   draws an argument from the very order of nature, inferring that if men
   both see and hear, by virtue of faculties which they have received from
   God the Creator, it is impossible that God himself, who formed the eye
   and the ear, should not possess the most perfect observation.

   10. He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct? He would have
   them argue from the greater to the less, that if God did not spare even
   whole nations, but visits their iniquity with punishment, they could
   not imagine that he would suffer a mere handful of individuals to
   escape with impunity. The comparison intended, however, may possibly be
   between the Gentiles and the Jews. If God punished the heathen nations,
   who had not heard his word, with much severity, the Jews might expect
   that they, who had been familiarised to instruction in his house, would
   receive still sharper correction, and that he would vindicate his
   justice most in that nation over which he had chosen to preside. Still
   the former sense of the passage appears to me preferable, That it is
   folly in any number of individuals to flatter themselves with impunity,
   when they see God inflicting public punishment upon collective people.
   Some think there is an exclusive allusion to the signal and memorable
   instances of Divine judgment recorded in Scripture, as in the
   destruction of Sodom with fire from heaven, (Genesis 19.) and of the
   whole human family by the flood, (Genesis 7.) But the simpler meaning
   is best, That it were the height of madness in individuals to think
   that they could escape when nations perish. In adding that God teacheth
   men knowledge, [22] the Psalmist glances at the overweening confidence
   of such as despise God, and pride themselves in their acuteness and
   shrewdness, as we find Isaiah denouncing a woe against those crafty
   enemies of God who dig deep, that they may hide themselves from his
   sight, (Isaiah 29:15.) It is a disease prevalent enough in the world
   still. We know the refuges under covert of which both courtiers and
   lawyers take occasion to indulge in shameless mockery of God. [23] It
   is as if the Psalmist had said -- You think to elude God through the
   confidence which you have in your acute understandings, and would
   pretend to dispute the knowledge of the Almighty, when, in truth, all
   the knowledge which is in the world is but as a drop from his own
   inexhaustible fullness.

   Psalm 94:11-13

   11. Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of men, [24] that they are vain. [25]
   12. Blessed is the man whom thou hast instructed, O God! And taught out
   of thy law; 13. To give him rest from days of evil whilst the pit is
   digged for the wicked.


   11. Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of men, etc. He again insists upon the
   folly of men in seeking to wrap themselves up in darkness, and hide
   themselves from the view of God. To prevent them from flattering
   themselves with vain pretexts, he reminds them that the mists of
   delusion will be scattered at once when they come to stand in God's
   presence. Nothing can avail them, so long as God from heaven stamps
   vanity upon their deepest counsels. The Psalmist's design in citing
   them before the Judge of all, is to make them thoroughly search and try
   their own hearts; for the great cause of their self-security lay in
   failing to realize God, burying all distinction between right and
   wrong, and, so far as that was possible, hardening themselves against
   all feeling. They might contrive to soothe their minds by means like
   these, but he tells them that God ridiculed all such trifling. The
   truth may be a plain one, and well known; but the Psalmist states a
   fact which many overlook, and which we would do well to remember, That
   the wicked, when they attempt to hide themselves under subtile refuges,
   cannot deceive God, and necessarily deceive themselves. Some read --
   They (that is, men themselves) are vanity; but this is a forced
   rendering, and the form of expression is one which both in the Greek
   and Hebrew may be translated, God knows that the thoughts of men are
   vain.

   12 Blessed is the man whom thou hast instructed, O God! The Psalmist
   now passes from the language of censure to that of consolation,
   comforting himself and others of the Lord's people with the truth, that
   though God might afflict them for a time, he consulted their true
   interests and safety. At no period of life is this a truth which it is
   unnecessary to remember, called as we are to a continued warfare. God
   may allow us intervals of ease, in consideration of our weakness, but
   would always have us exposed to calamities of various kinds. The
   audacious excesses to which the wicked proceed we have already noticed.
   Were it not for the comfortable consideration that they are a blessed
   people whom God exercises with the cross, our condition would be truly
   miserable. We are to consider, that in calling us to be his people, he
   has separated us from the rest of the world, to participate a blessed
   peace in the mutual cultivation of truth and righteousness. The Church
   is often cruelly oppressed by tyrants under color of law -- the very
   case of which the Psalmist complains in this psalm; for it is evident
   that he speaks of domestic enemies, pretending to be judges in the
   nation. Under such circumstances, a carnal judgment would infer, that
   if God really concerned himself in our welfare he would never suffer
   these persons to perpetrate such enormities. To prevent this, the
   Psalmist would have us distrust our own ideas of things, and feel the
   necessity of that wisdom which comes from above. I consider the passage
   to mean that it is only in the Lord's school we can ever learn to
   maintain composure of mind, and a posture of patient expectation and
   trust under the pressure of distress. The Psalmist declares that the
   wisdom which would bear us onward to the end, with an inward peace and
   courage under long-continued trouble, is not natural to any of us, but
   must come from God. [26] Accordingly, he exclaims, that those are the
   truly blessed whom God has habituated through his word to the endurance
   of the cross, and prevented from sinking under adversity by the secret
   supports and consolations of his own Spirit.

   The words with which the verse begins, Blessed is the man whom thou
   hast instructed, have no doubt a reference to chastisements and
   experience of the cross, but they also comprehend the gift of inward
   illumination; and afterwards the Psalmist adds, that this wisdom, which
   is imparted by God inwardly, is, at the same time, set forth and made
   known in the Scriptures. [27] In this way he puts honor upon the use of
   the written word, as we find Paul saying, that all things

   "were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort
   of the Scriptures, might have hope" (Romans 15:4)

   This shows from what quarter we are to derive our patience -- the
   oracles of God, which supply us with matter of hope for the mitigation
   of our griefs. In short, what the Psalmist means is summarily this:
   Believers must, in the first place, be exhorted to exercise patience,
   not to despond under the cross, but wait submissively upon God for
   deliverance; and next, they must be taught how this grace is to be
   obtained, for we are naturally disposed to abandon ourselves to
   despair, and any hope of ours would speedily fail, were we not taught
   from above that all our troubles must eventually issue in salvation. We
   have here the Psalmist's testimony to the truth, That the word of God
   provides us with abundant ground of comfort, and that none who rightly
   avails himself of it need ever count himself unhappy, or yield himself
   to hopelessness and despondency. One mark by which God distinguishes
   the true from the false disciple is, that of his being ready and
   prepared to bear the cross, and waiting quietly for the Divine
   deliverance, without giving way to fretfulness and impatience. A true
   patience does not consist in presenting an obstinate resistance to
   evils, or in that unyielding stubbornness which passed as a virtue with
   the Stoics, but in a cheerful submission to God, based upon confidence
   in his grace. On this account it is with good reason that the Psalmist
   begins by laying it down as a fundamental truth, necessary to be
   learned by all the Lord's people, That the end of those temporary
   persecutions, to which they are subjected, is their being brought at
   last to a blessed rest after their enemies have done their worst. He
   might have contented himself with saying, that the truly blessed were
   those who had learned from God's word to bear the cross patiently, but
   that he might the more readily incline them to a cheerful acquiescence
   in the Divine disposals, he subjoined a statement of the consolation
   which tends to mitigate the grief of their spirits. Even supposing that
   a man should bear his trials without a tear or a sigh, yet if he champ
   the bit in sullen hopelessness -- if he only hold by such principles as
   these, "We are mortal creatures," "It is vain to resist necessity, and
   strive against fate," "Fortune is blind" -- this is obstinacy rather
   than patience, and there is concealed opposition to God in this
   contempt of calamities under color of fortitude. The only consideration
   which will subdue our minds to a tractable submission is, that God, in
   subjecting us to persecutions, has in view our being ultimately brought
   into the enjoyment of a rest. Wherever there reigns this persuasion of
   a rest prepared for the people of God, and a refreshment provided under
   the heat and turmoil of their troubles, that they may not perish with
   the world around them, -- this will prove enough, and more than enough,
   to alleviate any present bitterness of affliction.

   By evil days, or days of evil, the Psalmist might thus mean the
   everlasting destruction which awaits the ungodly, whom God has spared
   for a certain interval. Or his words may be expounded as signifying,
   that the man is blessed who has learned to be composed and tranquil
   under trials. The rest intended would then be that of an inward kind,
   enjoyed by the believer even during the storms of adversity; and the
   scope of the passage would be, that the truly happy man is he who has
   so far profited, by the word of God, as to sustain the assault of evils
   from without, with peace and composure. But as it is added, whilst [28]
   the pit is digged for the wicked, it would seem necessary, in order to
   bring out the opposition contained in the two members of the sentence,
   to suppose that the Psalmist rather commends the wisdom of those who
   reckon that God afflicts them with a view to saving them from
   destruction, and bringing them eventually to a happy issue. It was
   necessary to state this second ground of comfort, because our hearts
   cannot fail to be affected with the most intense grief when we see the
   wicked triumph, and no Divine restraint put upon them. The Psalmist
   meets the temptation by appropriately reminding us that the wicked are
   left upon earth, just as a dead body which is stretched out upon a bed,
   till its grave be dug. Here believers are warned that, if they would
   preserve their constancy, they must mount their watchtower, as Habakkuk
   says, (Habakkuk 2:1) and take a view in the distance of God's
   judgments. They shall see worldly men rioting in worldly delights, and,
   if they extend their view no farther, they will give way to impatience.
   But it would moderate their grief, would they only remember that those
   houses which are nominally appropriated to the living, are, in fact,
   only granted to the dead, until their grave be digged; and that, though
   they remain upon earth, they are already devoted to destruction. [29]

   [24] Horsley reads, "the devices of man:" and asking, Did not St Paul
   for 'dm read rm, or rather rvm? refers to 1 Corinthians 3:20

   [25] The original word hvl is "from hvl, which first signifies to
   vanish, or come to nought, as in Jeremiah 2:5, They walked after hhvl,
   vanity, vyhvlv, and vanished, or came to nought;' and if understood
   here in this sense, it must signify vanishing, transient, that soon
   comes to nothing; and accordingly the Syriac renders it a vapour But
   there is another notion of hvl; it is put metaphorically for
   stultescere,' to grow foolish.' Thus in Psalms 62:11, it is best
   rendered from the Hebrew, Trust not in oppression and rapine, 'l-thvlv,
   become not vain,' i e., fools, to signify that those that so trust,
   that depend on unlawful means for enriching themselves, will certainly
   be deceived, find this the most perfect folly in the event. And the
   term folly being that by which the Atheist is most frequently expressed
   in Scripture, will be most agreeable to this place, where the Atheist's
   cogitations are described, verse 7, confident of God's not seeing nor
   regarding; which thoughts of his, as they are Atheistical, and so
   false, and so foolish in one sense, as folly is ignorance, so are they
   most impudent, (which is practical and the greatest folly,) will never
   secure his wicked actions of impunity, but, on the contrary, will
   betray him to all the ruin in the world. And to this sense it is, that
   in verse 8 we find it said in the like style, Understand, O ye brutish;
   and ye fools, when will ye be wise?' and so this is the adequate notion
   of the word here." -- Hammond

   Dieu nous inspire au dedans, nous est quant-et-quant proposee et

   [28] In our English Bible it is "until the pit be digged:" on which
   Hammond, who gives the same translation as Calvin, comments as follows:
   -- "The rendering of d, until, in this place, may much disturb the
   sense, and make it believed that the rest mymy r, from the evil days, i
   e., from persecution, (see Ephesians 5:16,) which God gives to good
   men, is to continue till the pit be digged for the ungodly, i e., till
   the measure of their sins be filled up, and so destruction be ready for
   them: whereas, the contrary of this is evident, that either the
   destruction of the wicked is first, and the quiet and rest of the good
   (oppressed by them) a natural effect of that, and so subsequent to it;
   or that both of them are of the same date, at once tribulation to them
   that trouble you, and to you who are troubled rest,' 2 Thessalonians
   1:6, 7. And this is evidently the meaning of it here, and so will be
   discerned, if only the 'd be rendered dum, whilst, (as it is elsewhere
   used, Jonah 4:2, 'd hyvty, whilst I was,' Job 1:16, 'd zh mdvr, whilst
   he was speaking,') for then thus it will run very fitly, That thou
   mayest give him rest -- whilst the pit is digged --'" Horsley reads the
   verse -- "To produce ease for him out of the days of adversity, Whilst
   the pit is digging for the impious."

   [29] "Que les maisons qui sont destinees aux vivans, pour un peu de
   temps sont bien concedees aux morts cependant qu'on leur fait leur
   fosse; et qu'en ceste facon ceux qui neantmoins sont destinez a
   perdition, demeurent en vie," etc. -- Fr.

   Psalm 94:14-15

   14. Surely Jehovah will not cast off his people, and he will not
   forsake his inheritance. 15. But judgment will return unto
   righteousness, and all the upright in heart after him.


   14 Surely Jehovah will not cast off his people He enforces the same
   truth which he had stated above in still clearer terms, denying it to
   be possible that God should cast off his people, whom he had chosen in
   a manner to be his inheritance. When assailed by afflictions, we should
   fly to this consideration, as a sanctuary of refuge, that we are God's
   people, gratuitously adopted into his family, and that he must
   necessarily have a most intimate and tender regard for our safety,
   having promised to watch as carefully over his Church as if it were his
   own heritage. We are thus again taught that our patience will soon give
   way and fail, unless the tumult of carnal suggestions be allayed by a
   knowledge of the Divine favor shining in upon our souls.

   15. But judgment will return unto righteousness In the dark season of
   affliction, it is not easy to recognize the secret love which God even
   then bears to his own children, and the Psalmist adduces another ground
   of comfort, in the consideration that God will eventually put an end to
   the confusions which perplex them, and reduce matters to order. The
   form of expression used by the Psalmist is a little obscure, and this
   has led some to read the first part of the verse, as if it contained
   two distinct clauses -- justice will return at the end, and then,
   judgment will return This is a violent wresting of the context. I have
   no doubt the Psalmist meant to say that judgment would be fitted or
   conformed to justice. And by judgment here is meant, as in many other
   places, the government or public state of matters. The confusion which
   prevails in the world, seems to argue some defect or unrighteousness of
   administration; and he holds out to us that it shall be well in the
   issue. More is said than merely that men who indulged in reckless
   oppression would be brought back to equitable dealing. A deeper meaning
   is intended, That God, when he interposed to restore the condition of
   his people, would bring forth openly to the light his justice which had
   lain concealed; by which we are not to understand that he ever deviates
   the least in his providence from the strictest rectitude, only there is
   not always that harmony and arrangement which might make his
   righteousness apparent to man's view, and the correction of this
   inequality is here called justice of government. [30] As the sun's
   light is hid from view at night, or at a cloudy season, so when the
   wicked persecute the righteous, and are allowed to indulge in iniquity
   without restraint, the Divine justice is obscured by the clouds which
   are thus interposed between us and the providence of God, and judgment
   is in a manner separated from justice. But when things are brought back
   again to their proper state, justice and government are seen to
   harmonize perfectly together in the equality which prevails. [31] Faith
   no doubt, should enable us to discern the justice of God even when
   things are most dark and disordered; but the passage speaks of what
   would be obvious to sense and actual observation, and asserts that the
   justice of God would shine as the sky when all is calm and serene.

   And all that are upright in heart after him Some read, after it, that
   is, after righteousness; but as by righteousness here we are to
   understand the equal and harmonious government which prevails when God
   takes vengeance upon the wicked and delivers his own people, this
   rendering will scarcely suit. It would rather seem that God himself is
   to be understood, so that the relative is here without an antecedent.
   In the Hebrew, when mention is made of God, the relative is not
   unfrequently put instead of the name. The words then mean, that upon
   God's restoring order in the world, his people would be encouraged to
   follow him with greater alacrity. Even when called to bear the cross,
   they sigh after him under their troubles and distresses, but it binds
   them more closely to his service when they see his hand stretched forth
   in this visible manner, and sensibly experience his deliverance.

   Psalm 94:16-19

   16. Who will rise up for me against my adversaries? who will stand up
   for me [32] against the workers of iniquity? 17. Unless Jehovah had
   been my help, my soul had well nigh dwelt in silence. [33] 18. If I
   said, My foot has fallen, thy kindness, O Jehovah! has held me up. [34]
   19. In the multitude of my thoughts, [35] thy comforts within me
   delight my soul. [36]


   16. Who will rise up for me against my adversaries? Here the Psalmist
   points out, in a lively and graphic manner, how destitute he was of all
   human aid. As if at the moment in danger, he cries out -- Who will
   stand up for me? Who will oppose himself to my enemies? And immediately
   afterwards he replies, that had not God helped him, he must have
   despaired of safety. In declaring that he had been thus miraculously
   rescued from death, when deserted by all the world, he commends the
   more God's kindness and grace. When men aid us, they are only
   instruments by which the grace of God works; but we are apt not to
   recognize God's hand when we see any subordinate agency in the
   deliverance. He speaks of his life dwelling in silence, (verse 17) for
   the dead lie in the grave without feeling or strength. Thus the
   Psalmist owns that there was no means by which his life could have been
   preserved, had not God interposed without delay.

   18. If I said, My foot has fallen What is said in this verse confirms
   the preceding statement. The more to commend God's kindness and power,
   he declares that it was no common danger from which he had been
   rescued, but in a manner from present death. The import of the language
   is, that death stared him so full in view, that he despaired of
   himself; as Paul speaks of having had the message of death in himself,
   when his condition was desperate, and he had given up hope of life, (2
   Corinthians 1:9.) The fact of the Psalmist having been delivered after
   he had considered death certain, made the Divine interposition the more
   conspicuous. If we understand him as speaking of temporal death only in
   the expression, My foot has fallen -- there is nothing unaccountable in
   the circumstance of his having despaired, [37] as God often prolongs
   the life of his people in the world, when they had lost hope, and were
   preparing for their departure. Possibly, however, the Psalmist only
   means that this was the language of sense; and this is the more
   probable, because we have already seen that he never ceased praying to
   God -- a proof that he had still some hope. The next verse affords
   still further proof, for there he tells us that his afflictions were
   always mixed with some comfort. By thoughts, he means anxious and
   perplexing cares, which would have overwhelmed him had not consolation
   been communicated to him from above. We learn this truth from the
   passage, That God interposes in behalf of his people, with a due regard
   to the magnitude of their trials and distresses, and at the very moment
   which is necessary, enlarging them in their straits, as we find stated
   in other places. The heavier our calamities grow, we should hope that
   Divine grace will only be the more powerfully manifested in comforting
   us under them, (Psalm 4:1; 118:5,) But should we through weakness of
   the flesh be vexed and tormented by anxious cares, we must be satisfied
   with the remedy which the Psalmist here speaks of in such high terms.
   Believers are conscious of two very different states of mind. On the
   one hand, they are afflicted and distressed with various fears and
   anxieties; on the other, there is a secret joy communicated to them
   from above, and this in accommodation to their necessity, so as to
   preserve them from being swallowed up by any complication or force of
   calamity which may assail them.

   Psalm 94:20-23

   20. Shall the throne of iniquities have fellowship with thee, framing
   molestation for law? [38] 21. They will gather together against the
   soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. 22. But Jehovah
   has been my fortress; and my God for the rock of my confidence. 23. And
   he shall repay their own iniquity upon them, and shall cut them off in
   their wickedness; Jehovah our God shall cut them off.


   20 Shall the throne of iniquities have fellowship with thee? He again
   derives an argument for confidence from the nature of God, it being
   impossible that he should show favor to the wicked, or sanction their
   evil devices. With God for their enemy, how could they escape being
   destroyed? The words have greater force from being thrown into the form
   of a question, to show how completely opposed all sin is to the divine
   nature. The term throne is used, because those against whom the present
   charge is brought were not common robbers or assassins, who are
   universally recognized as infamous, but tyrants who persecuted the
   Lord's people under color of law. These, although occupying the throne
   which has been consecrated to God, have stained and polluted it with
   their crimes, and therefore have nothing in common with it. The meaning
   is brought out more clearly in the subsequent clause of the verse,
   where they are declared to be persons utterly estranged from God, who
   frame molestation for law, or, as the Hebrew word chq, chok, signifies,
   decree of law, or statute order. The Psalmist aims at those profligate
   judges who, under pretense of pursuing the strict course of office,
   perpetrate the worst species of enormities. Judges of this abandoned
   character, as we know, with no other view than to retain possession of
   a specious name for integrity, invent various excuses to defend their
   infamous oppressions. The meaning of the Psalmist is apparent then; and
   it is this, that honorable as a throne may be, so far as the name goes,
   it ceases to have any worth or estimation with God when abused by
   wicked men; for iniquity can never meet with his approbation.

   21. They will gather together against the soul of the righteous As the
   Hebrew word gdd, gadad, or gvd, gud, [39] signifies to collect forces
   or a band of men, the Psalmist evidently intimates that he had to do
   with leading persons of influence, and not with those merely in private
   station. The term implies too, that it was not merely one or two
   private individuals who persecuted him, and others of the Lord's
   people, but a public convention. Melancholy and disgraceful must the
   state of matters have been, when the wicked thus ruled in lawful
   assembly, and those who formed the college of judges were no better
   than a band of robbers. The case becomes doubly vexatious, when the
   innocent victims of oppression are not only injured, but have a stigma
   fixed upon their character. And what more unseemly spectacle, than when
   the whole course of judicial administration is just a foul conspiracy
   against good and innocent men? [40] The instance here recorded should
   prepare us for a like emergency, if it chance to occur in our own day,
   when the wicked may be permitted, in the providence of God, to mount
   the seat of judgment, and launch destruction upon the upright and the
   righteous, under color of law. Intolerable as it might seem at first
   sight, that persons innocent of any crime should meet with cruel
   persecution, even from the hands of judges, so as to be loaded with
   ignominy, we see that God tried his children in other times by this
   double species of oppression, and that we must learn to bear
   submissively not only with unrighteous violence, but with charges most
   injurious to our character, and most undeserved. [41]

   22 But Jehovah has been my fortress The Psalmist declares, that great
   as were the extremities to which he had been reduced, he had found
   sufficient help in the single protection of God; thus passing a new
   commendation upon his power, which had been such as alone, and unaided,
   to put down the mightiest endeavors -- all the force and the fury of
   his numerous enemies. He does more than say that God was a fortress,
   where he might hide with safety, and from the top of which he could bid
   defiance to every assault. Having congratulated himself upon the divine
   protection, he proceeds to denounce destruction upon his enemies; for
   it is to be considered as God's special prerogative to make the evil
   which his enemies devise against his people recoil upon their own
   heads. The mere defeating, and frustrating their attempts, would afford
   no inconsiderable display of divine justice; but the judgment of God is
   far more marvellously manifested when they fall into the pit which they
   themselves had prepared, when all the subtle plans which they have
   adopted for ruining the innocent end in their being destroyed by their
   own craftiness, and when having done their utmost, they fall by their
   own sword. We are slow to believe that this shall be the issue, and
   accordingly it is said twice -- he shall cut them off -- the Lord our
   God shall cut them off It may be noticed also, that the Psalmist in
   using the expression our God, holds out a ground of encouragement to
   the faithful, reminding us of what he had said above, that God will not
   forget his own inheritance, even his people whom he has brought unto
   the faith of himself.

   PSALM 95

   The inspired penman of this psalm, whoever he was, [42] in exhorting
   the Jews to praise God in solemn assembly, states two grounds why God
   should be praised; the one, that he sustains by his power the world
   which he created, the other, that he had of his free grace adopted the
   Church into a gracious relationship with himself. As many take God's
   praises into their lips in a hypocritical manner, he exhorts the people
   at the same time to be sincere, serious, and devoted in the service,
   and to show by the tenor of their life that they had not been chosen in
   vain. The more effectually to guard them against hypocrisy, he mentions
   that their fathers from the beginning had been of a stubborn spirit,
   and chargeable with ingratitude to God; and he takes notice of the
   dreadful punishment which fell upon them, and which might well deter
   their children from following in the footsteps of their rebelliousness.

   Psalm 95:1-5

   1. Come, let us rejoice before Jehovah; let us make a joyful noise to
   the Rock of our salvation. [43] 2. Let us come before his face with
   praise, In psalms let us shout for joy unto him. 3. For Jehovah is a
   great God, And a great King, above all gods. 4. For in his hand are the
   deep places of the earth, [44] And the heights of the mountains are
   his. 5. For his is the sea, and he made it; And the dry land his hands
   formed.


   1. Come, let us rejoice before Jehovah. This psalm is suited for the
   Sabbath, when we know that the religious assemblies were more
   particularly convened for the worship of God. It is not individuals
   among the godly whom he exhorts to celebrate the divine praises in
   private; he enjoins these to be offered up in the public meeting. By
   this he showed that the outward worship of God principally consisted in
   the sacrifice of praise, and not in dead ceremonies. He enjoins haste
   upon them; by which they might testify their alacrity in this service.
   For the Hebrew word qdm, kadam, in the second verse, which I have
   rendered, let us come before, etc., means to make haste. He calls upon
   them to speed into the presence of God; and such an admonition was
   needed, considering how naturally backward we are when called by God to
   the exercise of thanksgiving. This indirect charge of indolence in the
   exercise, the Psalmist saw it necessary to prefer against God's ancient
   people; and we should be made aware that there is just as much need of
   a stimulus in our own case, filled as our hearts are with similar
   ingratitude. In calling them to come before God's face, he uses
   language which was also well fitted to increase the ardor of the
   worshippers; nothing being more agreeable than to offer in God's own
   presence such a sacrifice as he declares that he will accept. He
   virtually thus says, in order to prevent their supposing the service
   vain, that God was present to witness it. I have shown elsewhere in
   what sense God was present in the sanctuary.

   3. For Jehovah is a great God. By these words the Psalmist reminds us
   what abundant grounds we have for praising God, and how far we are from
   needing to employ the lying panegyric with which rhetoricians flatter
   earthly princes. First, he extols the greatness of God, drawing a tacit
   contrast between him and such false gods as men have invented for
   themselves. We know that there has always been a host of gods in the
   world, as Paul says,

   "There are many on the earth who are called gods,"
   (1 Corinthians 8:5.)

   We are to notice the opposition stated between the God of Israel and
   all others which man has formed in the exercise of an unlicensed
   imagination. Should any object, that "an idol is nothing in the world,"
   (1 Corinthians 8:4,) it is enough to reply, that the Psalmist aims at
   denouncing the vain delusions of men who have framed gods after their
   own foolish device. I admit, however, that under this term he may have
   comprehended the angels, asserting God to be possessed of such
   excellence as exalted him far above all heavenly glory, and whatever
   might be considered Divine, as well as above the feigned deities of
   earth. [45] Angels are not indeed gods, but the name admits of an
   improper application to them on account of their being next to God, and
   still more, on account of their being accounted no less than gods by
   men who inordinately and superstitiously extol them. If the heavenly
   angels themselves must yield before the majesty of the one God, it were
   the height of indignity to compare him with gods who are the mere
   fictions of the brain. In proof of his greatness, he bids us look to
   his formation of the world, which he declares to be the work of God's
   hands, and subject to his power. This is one general ground why God is
   to be praised, that he has clearly shown forth his glory in the
   creation of the world, and will have us daily recognize him in the
   government of it. When it is said, that the depths of the earth are in
   his hand, the meaning is, that it is ruled by his providence, and
   subject to his power. Some read, the bounds of the earth, but the word
   means abysses or depths, as opposed to the heights of the mountains.
   The Hebrew word properly signifies searching.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [43] Horsley reads the second clause, "Let us raise the loud peal of
   melody to the Rock of our salvation;" on which he has the following
   note: "The verb hry signifies to make a loud sound of any sort, either
   with the voice or with instruments. In the Psalms it generally refers
   to the mingled din of voices and various instruments, in the
   temple-service. This wide sense of the word cannot be expressed
   otherwise in the English language than by a peripharasis." Bishop Mant,
   acting on this notion, has ventured, conformably to it, to specify in
   his version some of the instruments commonly used in the
   temple-worship: -- "Come, let us sing Jehovah's praise!
   To him the pealing chorus raise,
   With trump, and harp, and cymbals ring;
   The rock on which our hopes are placed!"

   [44] "The deep places of the earth," which are opposed to the "heights
   of the mountains," plainly mean the deepest and most retired parts of
   the terraqueous globe, which are explored by the eye of God, and by his
   only. Horsely reads the verse thus, -- "The God in whose hand are the
   nethermost recesses of the earth,
   Whose also are the inaccessible summits of the mountains." "This, and
   the following verse," says he, "are expositive of the greatness of the
   Godship of Jehovah, generally mentioned in the lst verse. The God, in
   whose hand.' Thus, I have endeavoured to preserve the full force of the
   Hebrew phrase 'sr vydv." Bythner's version of the last member is, "And
   the strength of the mountains is his." He derives the noun vtvphvt,
   vethoaphoth, which he renders strength, from the verb yph, yaaph, was
   wearied; and observes, that this is "a noun plural feminine, weariness,
   -- by antiphrasis, strength: is read four times in Scripture, and is
   said of mountains, silver, and the unicorn, the weariness and
   difficulty in overcoming which, denote their great strength." Pagninus
   gives a similar rendering. Montanus has cacumina, the tops, which the
   Septuagint seems to agree, reading ta hu pse ton oreon.

   [45] "Deum ita excellere, ut longe emineat supra omnem coelestem
   gloriam et quicquid divinum est, non minus quam supra omne terrenum
   figmentum." -- Lat.

   Psalm 95:6-7

   6. Come ye, let us worship, and bow down; [46] let us kneel before the
   face of Jehovah our Maker. 7. Because he is our God, and we the people
   of his pastures, and the flock of his hand; to-day, if ye will hear his
   voice.


   6. Come ye, let us worship Now that the Psalmist exhorts God's chosen
   people to gratitude, for that pre-eminency among the nations which he
   had conferred upon them in the exercise of his free favor, his language
   grows more vehement. God supplies us with ample grounds of praise when
   he invests us with spiritual distinction, and advances us to a
   pre-eminency above the rest of mankind which rests upon no merits of
   our own. In three successive terms he expresses the one duty incumbent
   upon the children of Abraham, that of an entire devotement of
   themselves to God. The worship of God, which the Psalmist here speaks
   of, is assuredly a matter of such importance as to demand our whole
   strength; but we are to notice, that he particularly condescends upon
   one point, the paternal favor of God, evidenced in his exclusive
   adoption of the posterity of Abraham unto the hope of eternal life. We
   are also to observe, that mention is made not only of inward gratitude,
   but the necessity of an outward profession of godliness. The three
   words which are used imply that, to discharge their duty properly, the
   Lord's people must present themselves a sacrifice to him publicly, with
   kneeling, and other marks of devotion. The face of the Lord is an
   expression to be understood in the sense I referred to above, -- that
   the people should prostrate themselves before the Ark of the Covenant,
   for the reference is to the mode of worship under the Law. This remark,
   however, must be taken with one reservation, that the worshippers were
   to lift their eyes to heaven, and serve God in a spiritual manner. [47]

   7 Because he is our God While it is true that all men were created to
   praise God, there are reasons why the Church is specially said to have
   been formed for that end, (Isaiah 61:3.) The Psalmist was entitled to
   require this service more particularly from the hands of his chosen
   people. This is the reason why he impresses upon the children of
   Abraham the invaluable privilege which God had conferred upon them in
   taking them under his protection. God may indeed be said in a sense to
   have done so much for all mankind. But when asserted to be the Shepherd
   of the Church, more is meant than that he favors her with the common
   nourishment, support, and government which he extends promiscuously to
   the whole human family; he is so called because he separates her from
   the rest of the world, and cherishes her with a peculiar and fatherly
   regard. His people are here spoken of accordingly as the people of his
   pastures, whom he watches over with peculiar care, and loads with
   blessings of every kind. The passage might have run more clearly had
   the Psalmist called them the flock of his pastures, and the people of
   his hand; [48] or, had he added merely -- and his flock [49] -- the
   figure might have been brought out more consistently and plainly. But
   his object was less elegancy of expression than pressing upon the
   people a sense of the inestimable favor conferred upon them in their
   adoption, by virtue of which they were called to live under the
   faithful guardianship of God, and to the enjoyment of every species of
   blessings. They are called the flock of his hand, not so much because
   formed by his hand as because governed by it, or, to use a French
   expression, le Troupeau de sa conduite. [50] The point which some have
   given to the expression, as if it intimated how intent God was upon
   feeding his people, doing it himself, and not employing hired
   shepherds, may scarcely perhaps be borne out by the words in their
   genuine meaning; but it cannot be doubted that the Psalmist would
   express the very gracious and familiar kind of guidance which was
   enjoyed by this one nation at that time. Not that God dispensed with
   human agency, intrusting the care of the people as he did to priests,
   prophets, and judges, and latterly to kings. No more is meant than that
   in discharging the office of shepherd to this people, he exercised a
   superintendence over them different from that common providence which
   extends to the rest of the world.

   To-day, if you will hear his voice [51] According to the Hebrew
   expositors, this is a conditional clause standing connected with the
   preceding sentence; by which interpretation the Psalmist must be
   considered as warning the people that they would only retain possession
   of their privilege and distinction so long as they continued to obey
   God. [52] The Greek version joins it with the verse that follows --
   to-day, if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts, and it reads
   well in this connection. Should we adopt the distribution of the Hebrew
   expositors, the Psalmist seems to say that the posterity of Abraham
   were the flock of God's hand, inasmuch as he had placed his Law in the
   midst of them, which was, as it were, his crook, and had thus showed
   himself to be their shepherd. The Hebrew particle 'm, im, which has
   been rendered if, would in that case be rather expositive than
   conditional, and might be rendered when, [53] the words denoting it to
   be the great distinction between the Jews and the surrounding nations,
   that God had directed his voice to the former, as it is frequently
   noticed he had not done to the latter, (Psalm 147:20; Deuteronomy 4:6,
   7.) Moses had declared this to constitute the ground of their
   superiority to other people, saying, "What nation is there under heaven
   which hath its gods so nigh unto it?" The inspired writers borrow
   frequently from Moses, as is well known, and the Psalmist, by the
   expression to-day, intimates how emphatically the Jews, in hearing
   God's voice, were his people, for the proof was not far off, it
   consisted in something which was present and before their eyes. He bids
   them recognize God as their shepherd, inasmuch as they heard his voice;
   and it was an instance of his singular grace that he had addressed them
   in such a condescending and familiar manner. Some take the adverb to be
   one of exhortation, and read, I would that they would hear my voice,
   but this does violence to the words. The passage runs well taken in the
   other meaning we have assigned to it. Since they had a constant
   opportunity of hearing the voice of God -- since he gave them not only
   one proof of the care he had over them as shepherd, or yearly proof of
   it, but a continual exemplification of it, there could be no doubt that
   the Jews were chosen to be his flock.

   [48] Hammond, after making a similar remark, adds -- "But it is more
   reasonable to take the explanation from the different significations of
   rh, [the word which Calvin renders pasture,] as for feeding, so for
   governing, equally applicable to men and cattle; from whence it is but
   analogy, that mrh, which signifies a pasture, where cattle are fed,
   should also signify dominion or kingdom, or any kind of politeia,
   wherein a people are governed And then the other part, the sheep of his
   hand, will be a fit, though figurative, expression; the shepherd that
   feeds, and rules, and leads the sheep, doing it by his hand, which
   manageth the rod and staff, Psalm 23:4. The Jewish Arab reads, the
   people of his feeding, or flock, and the sheep of his guidance.'"

   [49] The text reads, "Si tantum nomen Legis posuisset." This is
   evidently a mistake of the printer for Gregis. The French version reads
   -- "Le Troupeau."

   [50] The flock under his conduct or guidance.

   [51] The ancient Jewish writers frequently apply these words to the
   Messiah: and they have argued from them, that if all Israel would
   repent but one day the Messiah would come; because it is said, "To-day,
   if ye will hear his voice."

   [52] Hammond observes, that the particle 'm, im, here rendered if, is
   in other places often used in an optative signification, as in Exodus
   32:32, "If thou wilt" for "O that thou wouldst forgive them;" and that
   therefore the rendering here may be, "O that to-day ye would hear his
   voice;" -- a reading, he adds, which "may be thought needful to the
   making the sense complete in this verse, which otherwise is thought to
   hang (though not so fitly) on the 8th verse, and not to be finished
   without it." He then goes on to say, "But it may be considered also,
   whether this verse be not more complete in itself by rendering 'm, if,
   thus: Let us worship and bow down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker;
   for he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and sheep of
   his hand, if ye will hear his voice to-day,' i e., speedily, -- if ye
   will speedily perform obedience to him, -- setting the words in form of
   a conditional promise, thereby to enforce the performance of the
   condition on our part. The condition to the performance of which they
   are exhorted, (verse 6,) is paying God the worship and lowly obedience
   due to him; and the promise secured to them in this performance, that
   he will be their God, and they the people of his pasture, etc., i e.,
   that God will take the same care of them that a shepherd does of his
   sheep; preserve them from all enemies, Midianites, Philistines,
   Canaanites, etc."

   Psalm 95:8-11

   8. Harden not your heart, as in Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the
   wilderness. [54] 9. When your fathers tempted me, they proved me,
   though yet they had seen my work. 10. Forty years, I strove with this
   generation, [55] and said, They are a people that err in heart, [56]
   and they have not known my ways. 11. Wherefore I have sworn in my
   wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: [57]


   8. Harden not your heart, as in Meribah The Psalmist, having extolled
   and commended the kindness of God their Shepherd, takes occasion, as
   they were stiffnecked and disobedient, to remind them of their duty, as
   his flock, which was to yield a pliable and meek submission; and the
   more to impress their minds, he upbraids them with the obstinacy of
   their fathers. The term mryvh, Meribah, may be used appellatively to
   mean strife or contention; but as the Psalmist evidently refers to the
   history contained in Exodus 17:2-7, [58] I have preferred understanding
   it of the place -- and so of msh, Massah. [59] In the second clause,
   however, the place where the temptation happened may be thought
   sufficiently described under the term wilderness, and should any read,
   according to the day of temptation (instead of Massah) in the
   wilderness, there can be no objection. Some would have it, that Massah
   and Meribah were two distinct places, but I see no ground to think so;
   and, in a matter of so little importance, we should not be too nice or
   curious. He enlarges in several expressions upon the hardness of heart
   evinced by the people, and, to produce the greater effect, introduces
   God himself as speaking. [60] By hardness of heart, he no doubt means,
   any kind of contempt shown to the word of God, though there are many
   different kinds of it. We find that when proclaimed, it is heard by
   some in a cold and slighting manner; that some fastidiously put it away
   from them after they had received it; that others proudly reject it;
   while again there are men who openly vent their rage against it with
   despite and blasphemy. [61] The Psalmist, in the one term which he has
   employed, comprehends all these defaulters, the careless -- the
   fastidious -- such as deride the word, and such as are actuated in
   their opposition to it by frenzy and passion. Before the heart can be
   judged soft and pliable to the hearing of God's word, it is necessary
   that we receive it with reverence, and with a disposition to obey it.
   If it carry no authority and weight with it, we show that we regard him
   as no more than a mere man like ourselves; and here lies the hardness
   of our hearts, whatever may be the cause of it, whether simply
   carelessness, or pride, or rebellion. He has intentionally singled out
   the odious term here employed, to let us know what an execrable thing
   contempt of God's word is; as, in the Law, adultery is used to denote
   all kinds of fornication and uncleanness, and murder all kinds of
   violence, and injury, hatreds, and enmities. Accordingly, the man who
   simply treats the word of God with neglect, and fails to obey it, is
   said here to have a hard and stony heart, although he may not be an
   open despiser. The attempt is ridiculous which the Papists have made to
   found upon this passage their favorite doctrine of the liberty of the
   will. We are to notice, in the first place, that all men's hearts are
   naturally hard and stony; for Scripture does not speak of this as a
   disease peculiar to a few, but characteristic in general of all
   mankind, (Ezekiel 36:26.) It is an inbred pravity; still it is
   voluntary; we are not insensible in the same manner that stones are,
   [62] and the man who will not suffer himself to be ruled by God's word,
   makes that heart, which was hard before, harder still, and is convinced
   as to his own sense and feeling of obstinacy. The consequence by no
   means follows from this, that softness of heart -- a heart flexible
   indifferently in either direction, is at our command. [63] The will of
   man, through natural corruption, is wholly bent to evil; or, to speak
   more properly, is carried headlong into the commission of it. And yet
   every man, who disobeys God therein, hardens himself; for the blame of
   his wrong doing rests with none but himself.

   9 When your fathers tempted me, they proved me The Psalmist insinuates,
   as I have already remarked, that the Jews had been from the first of a
   perverse and almost intractable spirit. And there were two reasons
   which made it highly useful to remind the children of the guilt
   chargeable upon their fathers. We know how apt men are to follow the
   example of their predecessors; custom begets a sanction; what is
   ancient becomes venerable, and such is the blinding influence of home
   example, that whatever may have been done by our forefathers passes for
   a virtue without examination. We have an instance in Popedom, of the
   audacity with which the authority of the fathers is opposed to God's
   word. The Jews were of all others most liable to be deceived upon this
   side, ever accustomed as they were to boast of their fathers. The
   Psalmist accordingly would detach them from the fathers, by taking
   notice of the monstrous ingratitude with which they had been
   chargeable. A second reason, and one to which I have already adverted,
   is, that he would show them the necessity in which they stood of being
   warned upon the present subject. Had their fathers not manifested a
   rebellions spirit, they might have retorted by asking the question,
   Upon what ground he warned them against hardness of heart, their nation
   having hitherto maintained a character for docility and tractableness?
   The fact being otherwise -- their fathers having from the first been
   perverse and stubborn, the Psalmist had a plain reason for insisting
   upon the correction of this particular vice.

   There are two ways of interpreting the words which follow. As tempting
   God is nothing else than yielding to a diseased and unwarrantable
   craving after proof of his power, [64] we may consider the verse as
   connected throughout, and read, They tempted me and proved me, although
   they had already seen my work God very justly complains, that they
   should insist upon new proof, after his power had been already amply
   testified by undeniable evidences. There is another meaning, however,
   that may be given to the term proved, -- according to which, the
   meaning of the passage would run as follows: -- Your fathers tempted me
   in asking where God was, notwithstanding all the benefits I had done
   them; and they proved me, that is, they had actual experience of what I
   am, inasmuch as I did not cease to give them open proofs of my
   presence, and consequently they saw my work. Whatever sense we adopt,
   the Psalmist's design is plainly to show how inexcusable the Jews were
   in desiring a discovery of God's power, just as if it had been hidden,
   and had not been taught them by the most incontestable proofs. [65]
   Granting that they had received no foregoing demonstration of it, they
   would have evinced an unbecoming spirit in demanding of God why he had
   failed to provide them with meat and drink; but to doubt his presence
   after he had brought them from Egypt with an outstretched hand, and
   evidenced his nearness to them by most convincing testimonies, -- to
   doubt his presence in the same manner as if it had never been revealed,
   was a degree of perverse forgetfulness which aggravated their guilt.
   Upon the whole, I consider the following to be the sense of the passage
   -- Your fathers tempted me, although they had abundantly proved --
   perceived by clear and undeniable evidences, that I was their God --
   nay, although my works had been clearly set before them. The lesson is
   one which is equally applicable to ourselves; for the more abundant
   testimonies we may have had of the power and loving-kindness of the
   Lord, the greater will our sin be, if we insist upon receiving
   additional proofs of them. How many do we find in our own day demanding
   miracles, while others murmur against God because he does not indulge
   their wishes? Some may ask why the Psalmist singles out the particular
   case of Meribah, when there were many other instances which he might
   have adduced. They never ceased to provoke God from the moment of their
   passing the Red Sea; and in bringing this one charge only against them,
   he might seem by his silence on other points to justify their conduct.
   But the figure synecdoche is common in Scripture, and it would be
   natural enough to suppose that one case is selected for many. At the
   same time, another reason for the specification may have been, that, as
   plainly appears from Moses, the ingratitude and rebellion of the people
   reached its greatest height on this occasion, when they murmured for
   water. I am aware that interpreters differ upon this. Such, however,
   was the fact. They then crowned their former impiety; nor was it until
   this outcry was made, as the consummating act of all their preceding
   wickedness, that they gave open proof of their obstinacy being
   incurable. [66]

   10. Forty years I strove with this generation [67] The Psalmist brings
   it forward as an aggravation of their perverse obstinacy, that God
   strove with them for so long a time without effect. Occasionally it
   will happen that there is a violent manifestation of perversity which
   soon subsides; but God complains that he had constant grounds of
   contention with his people, throughout the whole forty years. And this
   proves to us the incurable waywardness of that people. The word
   generation is used with the same view. The word dvr, dor, signifies an
   age, or the allotted term of human life; and it is here applied to the
   men of an age, as if the Psalmist had said, that the Israelites whom
   God had delivered were incorrigible, during the whole period of their
   lives. The verb 'qvt, akut, which I have rendered I strove, is, by
   some, translated contemned, and in the Septuagint it reads,
   prosochthisa, [68] I was incensed, or enraged; but Hebrew interpreters
   retain the genuine meaning, That God strove with them in a continual
   course of contention. This was a remarkable proof of their extreme
   obstinacy; and God is introduced in the verse as formally pronouncing
   judgment upon them, to intimate, that after having shown their
   ungodliness in so many different ways, there could be no doubt
   regarding their infatuation. Erring in heart, is an expression intended
   not to extenuate their conduct, but to stamp it with folly and madness,
   as if he had said, that he had to do with beasts, rather than men
   endued with sense and intelligence. The reason is subjoined, that they
   would not attend to the many works of God brought under their eyes, and
   more than all, to his word; for the Hebrew term drk, derech, which I
   have rendered ways, comprehends his law and repeated admonitions, as
   well as his miracles done before them. It argued amazing infatuation
   that when God had condescended to dwell in such a familiar manner
   amongst them, and had made such illustrious displays of himself, both
   in word and works, they should have shut their eyes and overlooked all
   that had been done. This is the reason why the Psalmist, considering
   that they wandered in error under so much light as they enjoyed, speaks
   of their stupidity as amounting to madness.

   11. Wherefore I have sworn in my wrath I see no objection to the
   relative 'sr, asher, being understood in its proper sense and reading
   -- To whom I have sworn. The Greek version, taking it for a mark of
   similitude, reads, As I have sworn But I think that it may be properly
   considered as expressing an inference or conclusion; not as if they
   were then at last deprived of the promised inheritance when they
   tempted God, but the Psalmist, having spoken, in the name of God, of
   that obstinacy which they displayed, takes occasion to draw the
   inference that there was good reason for their being prohibited, with
   an oath, from entering the land. Proportionally as they multiplied
   their provocations, it became the more evident that, being
   incorrigible, they had been justly cut off from God's rest. [69] The
   meaning would be more clear by reading in the pluperfect tense -- I had
   sworn; for God had already shut them out from the promised inheritance,
   having foreseen their misconduct; before he thus strove with them. I
   have elsewhere adverted to the explanation which is to be given of the
   elliptical form in which the oath runs. [70] The land of Canaan is
   called God's rest in reference to the promise. Abraham and his
   posterity had been wanderers in it until the full time came for
   entering upon the possession of it. Egypt had been a temporary asylum,
   and, as it were, a place of exile. In preparing to plant the Jews,
   agreeably to his promise, in their rightful patrimony of Canaan, God
   might very properly call it his rest. The word must be taken, however,
   in the active sense; this being the great benefit which God bestowed,
   that the Jews were to dwell there, as in their native soil, and in a
   quiet habitation. We might stop a moment here to compare what the
   Apostle states in the third and fourth chapters of his Epistle to the
   Hebrews, with the passage now before us. That the Apostle follows the
   Greek version, need occasion no surprise. [71] Neither is he to be
   considered as undertaking professedly to treat this passage. He only
   insists upon the adverb To-day, and upon the word Rest And first, he
   states that the expression to-day, is not to be confined to the time
   when the Law was given, but properly applies to the Gospel, when God
   began to speak more openly. The fuller and more perfect declaration of
   doctrine demanded the greater share of attention. God has not ceased to
   speak: he has revealed his Son, and is daily inviting us to come unto
   him; and, undoubtedly, it is our incumbent duty, under such an
   opportunity, to obey his voice. The Apostle next reasons from the rest,
   to an extent which we are not to suppose that the words of the Psalmist
   themselves warrant. [72] He takes it up as a first position, that since
   there was an implied promise in the punishment here denounced, there
   must have been some better rest promised to the people of God than the
   land of Canaan. For, when the Jews had entered the land, God held out
   to his people the prospect of another rest, which is defined by the
   Apostle to consist in that renouncing of ourselves, whereby we rest
   from our own works while God worketh in us. From this, he takes
   occasion to compare the old Sabbath, or rest, under the Law, which was
   figurative, with the newness of spiritual life. [73] When his said that
   he swore in his wrath, this intimates that he was in a manner freed to
   inflict this punishment, that the provocation was of no common or
   slight kind, but that their awful obstinacy inflamed his anger, and
   drew from him this oath.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [54] That is, in the wilderness of Midian, into which the people
   entered after passing through the Red Sea. In their way towards Horeb,
   their fourth station was at Rephidim, where they were chargeable with
   the sinful conduct here referred to.

   [55] Paul, in quoting this passage in Hebrews 3:9, joins the words
   forty years to the concluding part of the preceding verse: "When your
   fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years;" whereas,
   in the Hebrew text, and as Calvin connects them, they form the
   commencement of the 10th verse. But this depends on the punctuation
   system of the Masorites, which the Apostle has not followed. It is of
   little consequence whether the words forty years are connected with the
   close of the 9th verse or the beginning of the 10th; the sense in
   either case being substantially the same. If the Israelites tempted God
   forty years, he strove with them during that period; and if he strove
   with them for so long a time, it was because they tempted him. The
   Apostle shows that either of these readings may be indifferently
   adopted, when, in the 17th verse of that chapter, instead of speaking
   of the forty years as the space of time during which the Israelites
   tempted God, he speaks of them as the period during which God was
   grieved by that rebellious people. "But with whom was he grieved forty
   years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in
   the wilderness?"

   [56] m ty lvv, am toe lebab, "a nation wandering of heart." ty, toe, is
   from th, taah, he wandered, deviated The LXX., whom Paul follows in
   Hebrews 3:10, have aei planontai; from which Reeves conjectures, that
   instead of m ty, populus erratium, "a people that do err;" they might
   have read,lm ty "always erring." The phrase, erring in heart, is
   emphatic, indicating the great stress which God lays on the state of
   the heart. Moses Stuart, in his commentary on this passage, as quoted
   in Hebrews 3:10, understands the heart as pleonastic; so that the
   phrase imports simply, They always err, i e., they are continually
   departing from the right way. But the phrase, we think, is intended to
   convey another idea, -- that God, in judging of the character and
   conduct of men, has a special regard to the state of the heart. It is
   the heart which he principally requires in our obedience; and this he
   chiefly looks to in men's disobedience. When it is upright as to its
   general frame, design, and principle, he will bear with many failings
   and shortcomings. When it is insincere, he will set no value whatever
   on any outward professions or actions, however good in themselves. We
   ourselves act upon the same principle, and are justified in doing so.
   If a man discovers that he has just ground to suspect that the hearts
   of those with whom he has intimate intercourse, are false and deceitful
   towards him, he ceases to respect and love them, whatever may be their
   professions of friendship. The lines of the Greek poet, though
   inconsistent with the subdued feeling and tone of Christian
   benevolence, which, in this case, instead of hatred to the person,
   produces regret and grief; yet show that men universally, from their
   very nature, take into account the state of the heart in estimating the
   professions and conduct of others towards them: -- "Ecqov gar moi
   ceinov ojmwv ai`dao pulhsin
   Ov c eJteron men ceuqei eni fresin, allo de bazei" "I hate him like the
   gates of hell, who, pretending fairly to me,
   reserves other things in his mind."

   [57] The oath to which God here refers is recorded in Numbers 14:20,
   23.

   [58] This remarkable part of Jewish history is alluded to in other
   places, and for various purposes. Sometimes to reproach the Israelites
   on account of their sins, as in Deuteronomy 9:22, "And at Massah ye
   provoked the Lord to wrath;" sometimes to warn them against falling
   into the like sins, as in Deuteronomy 6:16, "Ye shall not tempt the
   Lord your God as ye tempted him in Massah;" and, at other times, as an
   instance of the faithfulness of the Levites who clave to God in these
   circumstances of trial, Deuteronomy 33:8, "And of Levi he said, Let thy
   Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at
   Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah."

   [59] In our English Bible it is, "in the provocation -- in the day of
   temptation." But the most eminent critics agree with Calvin in thinking
   that it is better to retain the terms Meribah and Massah than to
   translate them. The places called by these names were so designated
   from the Israelites provoking and tempting God at them; and the
   retaining of the proper names gives more effect and liveliness to the
   allusion. See Psalm 81:7, [3]volume 3, page 316, n. 2.

   [60] Mant and Walford suppose that it is at the second part of verse 7,
   "To-day, if ye will hear his voice," where God is introduced as
   speaking. "By an almost imperceptible transition," remarks the former
   critic, "the person is here [last clause of verse 7th] changed; Jehovah
   becomes the speaker; and with a corresponding change of topic, the Ode,
   which had commenced with a spiritual exhortation to exult in the
   blessings of the Gospel, concludes with a solemn, affectionate, and
   impressive admonition of the danger of disobedience to it; leaving the
   warning upon the mind with an abruptness peculiarly well calculated to
   excite attention and to produce the desired effect." Dimock
   conjectures, that, as God is introduced as speaking in the last clause
   of the 7th verse, we should read with Mudge, vqvly, for vqlv, (or, as
   37 MSS. and two others at first, vqvlv,) "Oh that you may hear my voice
   this day: that you may not harden your hearts," etc.

   enter,' which is the greatest and highest asseveration that they should
   not enter. And the concealment of the engagement is not, as some
   suppose, from a pathos, causing an abruptness of speech, but from the
   reverence of the person spoken of. The expression is perfectly and
   absolutely negative. So Mark 8:12, with Matthew 16:4; 1 Samuel 14:44; 1

   [42] This psalm has no inscription, but the Septuagint, Vulgate,
   Æthiopic, Arabic, and Syriac versions, and the apostle Paul in Hebrews
   4:7, ascribe it to David; so that there can be no doubt that it is one
   of the compositions of the sweet singer of Israel.

   PSALM 96

   This psalm contains an exhortation to praise God, an exhortation which
   is directed not only to the Jews, but to all nations. We must infer
   from this, that it has reference to the kingdom of Christ. God's name
   could not be called upon in any other part of the world than Judea,
   until it had been revealed; and the heathen nations were at that time
   necessarily altogether incapacitated for any such exercise. [74] Yet it
   is evident that the Holy Spirit stirred up the saints who were under
   the Law to celebrate the Divine praises, till the period should arrive
   when Christ, by the spread of the Gospel, should fill the whole earth
   with his glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 96:1-3

   1. Sing to Jehovah a new song, sing unto Jehovah, all the earth. 2.
   Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; show forth his salvation from day to
   day. 3. Declare his glory among the heathen; his wonders among all
   people.


   1 Sing unto Jehovah a new song This commencement shows that, as I have
   already observed, the Psalmist is exhorting the whole world, and not
   the Israelites merely, to the exercise of devotion. Nor could this be
   done, unless the gospel were universally diffused as the means of
   conveying the knowledge of God. The saying of Paul must necessarily
   hold true,

   "How shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed?" (Romans
   10:14.)

   The same Apostle proves the calling of the Gentiles, by adducing in
   testimony of it, "Praise the Lord, ye Gentiles, with his people" --
   from which it follows, that fellowship in the faith stands connected
   with the joint celebration of praise, (Romans 15:11.) Besides, the
   Psalmist requires a new song, [75] not one which was common, and had
   formerly been raised. He must therefore refer to some unusual and
   extraordinary display of the Divine goodness. Thus, when Isaiah speaks
   of the restoration of the Church, which was wonderful and incredible,
   he says, "Sing unto the Lord a new song," (Isaiah 42:10.) The Psalmist
   intimates accordingly, that the time was come when God would erect his
   kingdom in the world in a manner altogether unlooked for. He intimates
   still more clearly as he proceeds, that all nations would share in the
   favor of God. He calls upon them everywhere to show forth his
   salvation, and, in desiring that they should celebrate it from day to
   day, would denote that it was not of a fading or evanescent nature, but
   such as should endure for ever.

   3 Declare his glory among the heathen Additional terms are adduced to
   commend the salvation spoken of. It is called his glory and his
   wonders; which is equivalent to saying that it was glorious and
   admirable. By such titles the Psalmist would distinguish it from any
   deliverances which had formerly been granted, as indeed there can be
   but one opinion, that when God appeared as Redeemer of all the world,
   he gave a display of his mercy and of his favor, such as he never
   vouchsafed before. This salvation it was impossible, as I have said,
   that the Gentile nations could have celebrated, had they been left
   without it. The words teach us that we can never be said to have
   rightly apprehended the redemption wrought out by Christ, unless our
   minds have been raised to the discovery of something incomparably
   wonderful about it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [75] We meet with a psalm very similar to this, in 1 Chronicles 16,
   delivered by David to Asaph, to be sung on occasion of the removing of
   the ark from the house of Obed-edom to Zion. But the ode, as it stands
   in 1 Chronicles 16, is considerably longer, extending from the 8th
   verse to the 36^th [1Ch 16:8-36]; and this is only the part of it from
   the 23rd to the 33rd verse [1Ch 16:23-33]. It has been supposed that
   this part was extracted from the psalm above mentioned, and, with a few
   inconsiderable alterations, adapted to the solemnity of the dedication
   of the second temple. This opinion is founded upon the inscription of
   the psalm in the Septuagint, Vulgate, Æthiopic, and Arabic versions,
   which is, "A song of David when the house was built after the
   captivity." Consequently, strictly speaking, this is not a new song.
   But it may be called new, from its having been adapted to a new purpose
   -- from its having been intended to celebrate new mercies conferred
   upon the Jews, and to lead the mind forward to the glorious era of the
   coming of the Messiah, and the establishment of his kingdom, which
   probably was the matter of more general expectation among the chosen
   people, at the period when the temple was rebuilt, than when the ark
   was brought to Mount Zion from the house of Obed-edom. It may be
   observed, that the first verse is not in the original poem, as recorded
   in the book of Chronicles, but appears to have been added for the new
   occasion to which this shorter psalm was adapted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 96:4-6

   4. For Jehovah is great, and greatly to be praised; he is terrible
   above all gods. [76] 5. For all the gods of the nations are vanities;
   [77] but Jehovah made the heavens. 6. Strength and honor are before
   him; power and glory are in his sanctuary.


   4. For Jehovah is great, and greatly to be praised. He particularly
   describes that God, whom he would have men to celebrate, and this
   because the Gentile nations were prone to merge into error upon this
   subject. That the whole world might abjure its superstitions, and unite
   in the true religion, he points out the one only God who is worthy of
   universal praise. This is a point of the greatest importance. Unless
   men are restrained by a due respect to it, they can only dishonor him
   the more that they attempt to worship him. We must observe this order
   if we would not profane the name of God, and rank ourselves amongst
   unbelieving men, who set forth gods of their own invention. By gods in
   the verse may be meant, as I observed already, (Psalm 95:3,) either
   angels or idols. I would still be of opinion that the term comprehends
   whatever is, or is accounted deity. As God, so to speak, sends rays of
   himself through all the world by his angels, these reflect some sparks
   of his Divinity. [78] Men, again, in framing idols, fashion gods to
   themselves which have no existence. The Psalmist would convince them of
   its being a gross error to ascribe undue honor either to the angels or
   to idols, thus detracting from the glory of the one true God. He
   convicts the heathen nations of manifest infatuation, upon the ground
   that their gods are vanity and nought, for such is the meaning of the
   Hebrew word 'lylym, elilim, [79] which is here applied to idols in
   contempt. The Psalmist's great point is to show, that as the Godhead is
   really and truly to be found in none but the one Maker of the world,
   those religions are vain and contemptible which corrupt the pure
   worship of him. Some may ask, Are angels then to be accounted nothing
   and vanity, merely because many have been deceived in thinking them
   gods? I would reply, that we do injury to the angels when we give them
   that honor which is due to God only; and, while we are not on this
   account to hold that they are nothing in themselves, yet whatever
   imaginary glory has been attached to them must go for nothing. [80] But
   the Psalmist has in his eye the gross delusions of the heathen, who
   impiously fashioned gods to themselves.

   Before refuting their absurd notions, he very properly remarks of God
   that he is great, and greatly to be praised -- insinuating that his
   glory as the infinite One far excels any which they dreamt of as
   attaching to their idols. We cannot but notice the confidence with
   which the Psalmist asserts the glory of the true God, in opposition to
   the universal opinion which men might entertain. The people of God were
   at that time called to maintain a conflict of no inconsiderable or
   common description with the hosts and prodigious mass of superstitions
   which then filled the whole world. The true God might be said to be
   confined within the obscure corner of Judea. Jupiter was the god every
   where received -- and adored throughout the whole of Asia, Europe, and
   Africa. Every country had its own gods peculiar to itself, but these
   were not unknown in other parts, and it was the true God only who was
   robbed of that glory which belonged to him. All the world had conspired
   to believe a lie. Yet the Psalmist, sensible that the vain delusions of
   men could derogate nothing from the glory of the one God, [81] looks
   down with indifference upon the opinion and universal suffrage of
   mankind. The inference is plain, that we must not conclude that to be
   necessarily the true religion which meets with the approbation of the
   multitude; for the judgment formed by the Psalmist must have fallen to
   the ground at once, if religion were a thing to be determined by the
   suffrages of men, and his worship depended upon their caprice. Be it
   then that ever so many agree in error, we shall insist after the Holy
   Ghost that they cannot take from God's glory; for man is vanity
   himself, and all that comes of him is to be mistrusted. [82] Having
   asserted the greatness of God, he proves it by reference to the
   formation of the world, which reflects his perfections. [83] God must
   necessarily exist of himself, and be self-sufficient, which shows the
   vanity of all gods who made not the world. The heavens are mentioned --
   a part for the whole -- as the power of God is principally apparent in
   them, when we consider their beauty and adornment.

   6 Strength and honor are before him I translate the Hebrew word hvd,
   hod, by strength, and think those interpreters who render it glory have
   not duly considered the context. It is evident that the next member of
   the verse is a repetition, and there it reads, Power and Glory are in
   his sanctuary. The Psalmist means that we cannot be said to know God if
   we have not discovered that there is in him an incomparable glory and
   majesty. He first takes notice of his power and strength, as that in
   which his glory consists. There, as God is invisible, he directs the
   thoughts of his people to the sanctuary, which we have already seen to
   be the symbol of his presence. Such is the weakness of our minds that
   we rise with difficulty to the contemplation of his glory in the
   heavens. The Psalmist reminds us that we have no reason to say that his
   glory is obscure, since there were emblems of his presence in the
   temple, the sacrifices, and the ark of the covenant. Let us endeavor,
   when we make mention of God, to conceive of this glory which shines
   before him -- otherwise, if we do not apprehend his power, it is rather
   a dead than a living God whom we worship. [84]

   [76] The original word for gods is 'lhym, elohim Dr Adam Clarke, who
   doubts whether this word is ever by fair construction applied to false

   prophecy, on which no dependence can be placed, is called 'lyl, elil,
   "a thing of nought," Jeremiah 14:14, and a shepherd that leaves the
   flock, and instead of visiting, healing and feeding them, devours and
   tears them in pieces, is called in Zechariah 11:15, 16, "a pastor,
   h'lyl, haelil, of no value." In this sense the word is used of the
   false gods of the heathen. Instead of being 'lhym, elohim, gods, they
   are 'lylym, elilim, mere nothings Accordingly, Paul, in 1 Corinthians
   8:4, speaks of an idol as being "nothing in the world."

   Psalm 96:7-9

   7. Give to Jehovah, O ye assemblies of peoples! give to Jehovah glory
   and strength. [85] 8. Give to Jehovah the glory of his name; bring an
   offering, [86] and come into his courts. 9. Worship before Jehovah in
   the beauty of the sanctuary; [87] let the whole earth tremble before
   his face.


   7 Give to Jehovah, etc. Since praise waited for God in Zion, (Psalm
   65:1,) and that was the place devoted to the celebration of his
   worship, and the posterity of Abraham were alone invested with the
   privilege of priesthood, we cannot doubt that the Psalmist refers here
   to that great change which was to take place in the Church upon the
   advent of Christ. An opposition or distinction is intended between
   God's ancient people and the Gentile tribes, which were to be
   afterwards adopted into the same fellowship. To declare his glory and
   strength, is the same with declaring the glory of his strength And to
   show that man can boast nothing of his own, and in refusing to
   celebrate God, impiously despoils him of his just honors, he subjoins,
   Give unto the Lord the glory of his name; an expression which denotes
   that God borrows nothing from without, but comprehends all that is
   worthy of praise in himself. He calls upon the Gentile nations in so
   many words to render unto God the same worship which the Jews did; not
   that we must worship God now according to the outward ritual which was
   prescribed under the Law, but he signifies that there would be one rule
   and form of religion in which all nations should accord. Now, unless
   the middle wall of partition had been broken down, the Gentiles could
   not have entered along with God's children into the courts of the
   sanctuary. So that we have here a clear prediction of the calling of
   the Gentiles, who needed to have their uncleanness taken away before
   they could be brought into the holy assembly. The mincha, or oblation,
   was only one kind of sacrifice, but it is here taken to denote the
   whole worship of God, because it was a part of divine service more
   ordinarily practiced. We see from this, and other passages, that the
   inspired penmen describe the inward worship of God under symbols common
   in the age when they lived. God would not have meat-offerings presented
   to him after Christ had come; but the words which the Psalmist employs
   intimate that the doors of the temple, once shut, were now to be opened
   for the admission of the Gentiles. The Apostle, in his Epistle to the
   Hebrews, (Hebrews 13:15) tells us what are those sacrifices with which
   God will now be worshipped. Hence the absurdity of the Papists, who
   would adduce such passages in support of the mass and their other
   fooleries. We may very properly learn from the words, however, that we
   ought not to come empty-handed into the presence of God, enjoined as we
   are to present ourselves and all that we have as a reasonable service
   unto Him, (Romans 12:1; 1 Peter 2:5.)

   9 Worship before Jehovah The Psalmist prosecutes the same train of
   sentiment. In requiring oblations of his people, God was not to be
   considered as standing in need of the services of the creature, but as
   giving them an opportunity of professing their faith. The true reason,
   therefore, is here mentioned why the oblation was enjoined, That his
   people might prostrate themselves before him, and acknowledge that they
   and all belonging to them were his. Mention is made of the beauty of
   the temple, referring to the fact that the Gentiles should be raised to
   a new honor, in being associated into one body with God's chosen
   people. [88] At the time when this psalm was written, it was generally
   deemed scarcely credible that the heathen nations would be admitted
   into the temple in company with the holy seed of Abraham. This should
   make us think all the more highly of our calling as Gentiles, which
   seemed then so incredible and impracticable a thing. We may be
   convinced that God only could have opened for us the door of salvation.
   The beauty of the temple is an expression intended to beget a
   reverential view of the temple, that men may approach it with humble
   fear, instead of rushing without consideration into God's presence. The
   clause which follows in the verse is inserted for the same purpose --
   tremble before his face, intimating that we should prostrate ourselves
   as suppliants before him when we consider his awful majesty. Not that
   he would deter worshippers from drawing near to God. They should esteem
   it their greatest pleasure and enjoyment to seek his face. But he would
   have us humbled to the right and serious worship of God. I may add,
   that the beauty or glory of the sanctuary did not consist in silver and
   gold, in the preciousness of the material of which it was made, nor in
   polished stones, nor in any splendor and decoration of this kind, but
   in the representation of the heavenly pattern which was shown to Moses
   on the mount, (Exodus 25:9.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [85] The original word for strength is z, oz, which is derived from zz,
   azaz, he was strong "The same word," says Hammond, "signifies what the
   Greeks call exousia, power, dominion, empire In the notion of strength
   or valour it may probably be used in verse 6, where as beauty so
   strength is said to be in his sanctuary; beauty in respect of the glory
   of the divine presence, by the guard of angels that attend there, and
   strength in respect of the assistance that is by God provided and
   furnished there to all that seek it by prayer. But the other notion is
   fitter for this place, where the word is joined with glory and
   attributed to God; and so in 1 Peter 5:11, which seems to be taken from
   hence, it is auto he doxa kai to kratos, to him be glory and dominion;'
   and hence God's title of pantokrator is best rendered, not almighty,'
   or he that hath all strength' but he that hath the z or, kratos,
   dominion or empire over all.'"

   [86] Horsley reads, "Take an offering." "A mincha," says he, "an
   offering of bread and flour, not of flesh."

   [87] The words vhdrt-qds, which Calvin renders, "in the beauty of the
   sanctuary," are rendered in our English Bible "in the beauty of
   holiness." The Septuagint reads, aulo hagia autou, "in the court of his
   holiness;" from which it has been thought probable that the text
   originally stood vchtsr-qvv. See this word at the end of the preceding
   verse. In Psalm 29:2, the same sentence occurs. The version of Calvin,
   and that of Jerome, which is precisely the same, in decore sanctuarii,
   partake both of the Hebrew and Septuagint reading.

   Psalm 96:10-13

   10. Say among the heathen, Jehovah reigneth; also the world shall be
   established, it shall not be moved: he shall judge the peoples [89] in
   righteousness, [literally, in righteousnesses.] 11. Let the heavens
   rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea thunder, and the
   fullness thereof. 12. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein;
   likewise let all the trees of the wood rejoice. [90] 13. Before
   Jehovah; for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall
   judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth. [91]


   10. Say among the heathen, Jehovah reigneth His language again implies
   that it is only where God rules and presides that he can be worshipped.
   The Gentiles could not possibly profess the worship of God, so long as
   his throne was only in the small corner of Judea, and they were not
   acknowledging his government. Accordingly, the Psalmist speaks of his
   extending his kingdom to all parts of the world, with the view of
   gathering unto himself in one, those who had formerly been divided and
   scattered. The expression, Say among the heathen, signifies that God
   would enlarge the boundaries of his kingdom by his word and doctrine.
   What is said of the world being established, is particularly worthy of
   our observation. So far as the order of nature is concerned, we know
   that it has been Divinely established, and fixed from the beginning;
   that the same sun, moon, and stars, continue to shine in heaven; that
   the wicked and the unbelieving are sustained with food, and breathe the
   vital air, just as do the righteous. Still we are to remember that so
   long as un-godliness has possession of the minds of men, the world,
   plunged as it is in darkness, must be considered as thrown into a state
   of confusion, and of horrible disorder and misrule; for there can be no
   stability apart from God. The world is very properly here said
   therefore to be established, that it should not shake, when men are
   brought back into a state of subjection to God. We learn this truth
   from the passage, That though all the creatures should be discharging
   their various offices, no order can be said to prevail in the world,
   until God erect his throne and reign amongst men. What more monstrous
   disorder can be conceived of, than exists where the Creator himself is
   not acknowledged? Wicked and unbelieving men may be satisfied with
   their own condition, but it is necessarily most insecure, most
   unstable; and destitute as they are of any foundation in God, their
   life may be said to hang by a thread. [92] We are to recollect what we
   have seen taught, (Psalm 46:5) "God is in the midst of the holy city,
   she shall not be moved." Very possibly there may be an indirect
   allusion to the imperfect and uncompleted state of things under the
   Law, and a contrast may have been intended between the perfect
   condition of things which should obtain under Christ, and the prelude
   to it under the former period. Next he predicts that the kingdom to be
   introduced should be distinguished by righteousness, according to what
   we have seen, (Psalm 45:6) "A scepter of righteousness is the scepter
   of thy kingdom." The term judging, in the Hebrew, includes government
   of any kind. If God's method of governing men be to form and regulate
   their lives to righteousness, we may infer, that however easily men may
   be satisfied with themselves, all is necessarily wrong with them, till
   they have been made subject to Christ. And this righteousness of which
   the Psalmist speaks has not reference merely to the outward actions. It
   comprehends a new heart, commencing as it does in the regeneration of
   the Spirit, by which we are formed again into the likeness of God.

   11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad. With the view of
   giving us a more exalted conception of the display of God's goodness in
   condescending to take all men under his government, the Psalmist calls
   upon the irrational things themselves, the trees, the earth, the seas,
   and the heavens, to join in the general joy. Nor are we to understand
   that by the heavens he means the angels, and by the earth men; [93] for
   he calls even upon the dumb fishes of the deep to shout for joy. The
   language must therefore be hyperbolical, designed to express the
   desirableness and the blessedness of being brought unto the faith of
   God. At the same time, it denotes to us that God does not reign with
   terror, or as a tyrant, but that his power is exercised sweetly, and so
   as to diffuse joy amongst his subjects. The wicked may tremble when his
   kingdom is introduced, but the erection of it is only the cause of
   their fear indirectly. [94] We might notice also, that the hyperbole
   here employed does not want a certain foundation of a more literal
   kind. As all elements in the creation groan and travail together with
   us, according to Paul's declaration, (Romans 8:22) they may reasonably
   rejoice in the restoration of all things according to their earnest
   desire. The words teach us how infatuated that joy is, which is
   wantonly indulged in by men who are without God. From the close of the
   psalm, we learn that it is impossible to experience the slightest
   measure of true joy, as long as we have not seen the face of God,
   Rejoice before the Lord, because he cometh And if the very sea and land
   mourn so long as God is absent, may we not ask what shall become of us,
   who are properly the subjects of God's dreadful curse? The Psalmist, to
   remove all doubt regarding an event which might seem incredible,
   repeats his assertion of it, and states, at the same time, in what that
   rectitude consists, which he had formerly mentioned, when he adds, that
   God shall govern the world with righteousness and truth. This shows us
   that it is only by the light of God's righteousness and truth that the
   wickedness and hypocrisy of men can be removed and dispelled.

   [90] The Hebrew verb rnnv, rannenu, here rendered rejoice, "expresses,"

   support of this sense of the word he refers to Bishop Horsley's note on
   Psalm 98:8, and Parkhurst's Lexicon on rnn, 1:2. Accordingly, he
   translates the verse -- "Be glad, ye fields, and fruits, the fields
   that spread;
   Wave high, ye woods, in worship wave the head;" which, he observes,
   will remind the reader of Adam and Eve's morning hymn: -- "-- and wave

   "that noble exultation of universal nature in the 96th Psalm, which has
   been so often commended, where the whole animate and inanimate creation
   unite in the praises of their Maker. Poetry here seems to assume the

   PSALM 97

   The description which we have of the kingdom of God in this psalm, does
   not apply to the state of it under the Law. We may infer, accordingly,
   that it contains a prediction of that kingdom of Christ, which was
   erected upon the introduction of the Gospel. The Psalmist, while he
   commends it to us by insisting upon its greatness and glory, so well
   calculated to compel the reverential fear of men, gives an amiable
   representation of it, by informing us that it has been erected for the
   salvation of mankind sinners.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 97:1-5

   1. Jehovah reigns: let the earth rejoice, let the great islands [95] be
   glad. 2. Clouds and darkness are round about him; righteousness and
   judgment are the habitation [96] of his throne. 3. A fire shall go
   before his face, and shall burn up his enemies round about. 4. His
   lightnings enlightened the world; the earth shall see, and tremble. 5.
   The hills flow down like wax at the presence of Jehovah, at the
   presence of the Lord of the whole earth.


   1 Jehovah reigns His inviting men to rejoice, is a proof that the reign
   of God is inseparably connected with the salvation and best happiness
   of mankind. And, the joy he speaks of being common to the whole world
   and to the regions beyond the seas, it is evident that he predicts the
   enlargement of God's kingdom, which had been confined within the narrow
   boundaries of Judea, to a far wider extent. The Psalmist, in setting
   forth the various particulars of the Divine glory in the four verses
   which follow, would seek to impress all men with a reverential fear of
   him. Thus he gives us a representation of the formidable majesty
   attaching to God, that he may dash and humble vain confidence and
   carnal pride. A cloudy sky overawes us more than a clear one, as the
   darkness produces a peculiar effect upon the senses. The Psalmist makes
   use of this symbol, no doubt, to impress the world with the greater
   reverence of God. Others refine more upon the words, and think that
   clouds are said to be round about God, to check human rashness and
   presumption, and restrain that excessive curiosity which would pry more
   than is fit into the mysteries of Godhead. This is an interpretation of
   the words which makes them convey a very useful lesson; but I am
   against all refined renderings, and think that the Psalmist intended in
   associating darkness with God, to impress the hearts of men with a fear
   of him in general. [97] The same meaning is brought out in the
   remaining context, when fire is said to go before him, and burn up his
   enemies, his lightnings to shake the earth, and the mountains to flow
   down. Should any object that this does not agree with what was said of
   the joy which his kingdom diffuses, I might answer, first, that
   although God is ready on his part to diffuse blessedness wherever he
   reigns, all are not capable of appreciating it. Besides, as I have
   already hinted, the truth is one of use to believers, humbling the
   pride of the flesh, and deepening their adoration of God. God's throne
   is represented as founded in justice and judgment, to denote the
   benefit which we derive from it. The greatest misery which can be
   conceived of, is that of living without righteousness and judgment, and
   the Psalmist mentions it as matter of praise exclusively due to God,
   that when he reigns, righteousness revives in the world. He as
   evidently denies that we can have any righteousness, till God subjects
   us to the yoke of his word, by the gentle but powerful influences of
   his Spirit. A great proportion of men obstinately resist and reject the
   government of God. Hence the Psalmist was forced to exhibit God in his
   severer aspect, to teach the wicked that their perverse opposition will
   not pass unpunished. When God draws near to men in mercy, and they fail
   to welcome him with becoming reverence and respect, this implies
   impiety of a very aggravated description; on which account it is that
   the language of denunciation suits with the kingdom of Christ. The
   Psalmist intimates that those who should despise God in the person of
   his only-begotten Son, will feel in due time and certainly the awful
   weight of his majesty. So much is implied in the expression used -- The
   earth Shall See. For the wicked, when they find that their attempts are
   vain in fighting against God, resort to subterfuge and concealment. The
   Psalmist declares that they would not succeed by any such vain artifice
   in hiding themselves from God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [95] "Ou, que beaucoup d'isles." -- Fr marg "Or, let the many isles."
   Horsley and some other critics object to translating the original word,
   'yym, iyim, by isles He reads, "Let the various settlements of man
   rejoice:" on which he observes, "I cannot more exactly render the force
   of the Hebrew 'yym, than by this periphrasis. The English language hath
   no single word to convey the same idea; and the word isles' or
   islands,' hath hardly any relation to it." Fry's note here is as
   follows: -- "The Hebrew terms rendered, the multitude of the isles,'
   the various settlements of men,' the extended shores,' seem in a
   special manner to designate these western parts of the world, which
   were known as distant coasts visited by the ships of Tyre. All Europe
   might originally fall under this denomination, with some parts of the
   sea coasts of Africa, and even of Asia; nor can there be any doubt,
   that all subsequent discoveries by sea, once uninhabited, but now
   colonized, and settled from the old countries, would be designated by
   this term. Some nations of this description are called upon, in
   particular, to rejoice in the Savior's appearing."

   [96] The word mkvn, mechon, here rendered "habitation," is from kvn,
   kun, he prepared, fitted, confirmed "It is used," says Hammond, "for a
   place, seat, but especially a basis, whereon anything is set: from
   whence the LXX. had their mechosoth, (the very Hebrew mkvnvt) for
   basis, 1 Kings 7:27. The Chaldee here retains the original mkvn, but
   the LXX., from the notion of the verb for fitting, read katorthosis,
   the setting right of his throne;' the Syriac, by way of paraphrase, by
   equity and judgment thy throne is confirmed:' all which concur to the
   notion of basis or foundation, which is the thing that gives the
   rectitude first, and then the stability, to the chair or throne that is
   set on it. And so that is unquestionably the right, intelligible
   rendering of the phrase, Righteousness and judgment are the (not
   habitation but) basis of his throne,' i e., his sentences, decrees,
   judicatures, are all built upon righteousness and judgment, as a throne
   is built and established on a foundation."

   Psalm 97:6-8

   6. The heavens have declared his righteousness, and all the people have
   seen his glory. 7. Confounded be all those who serve graven images, who
   glory in their inventions; [98] let all the gods worship before him. 8.
   Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah [99] rejoiced
   because of thy judgments, O Jehovah!


   6 The heavens have declared his righteousness Here he states that there
   would be such an illustrious display of the righteousness of God, that
   the heavens themselves would herald it. The meaning is not the same as
   in the beginning of the nineteenth psalm, "The heavens declare the
   glory of God," etc. In that psalm David means no more than that the
   wisdom and power of God are as conspicuous in the fabric of the
   heavens, as if God should assert them with an audible voice. The
   meaning of the passage before us is, that the spiritual righteousness
   of God should be so signally manifested under the reign of Christ as to
   fill both heaven and earth. There is much force in this
   personification, in which the heavens, as if even they were penetrated
   with a sense of the righteousness of God, are represented as speaking
   of it. It is equally probable, however, that the heavens signify here
   the angels, who are contained in heaven, by the figure of metonomy or
   synecdoche, while, in the corresponding clause, instead of the earth
   being mentioned, he speaks of the peoples who dwell upon it. The angels
   may very properly be said to announce and celebrate the Divine glory.

   7 Confounded be all those who serve graven images. The Psalmist draws a
   broad distinction here, as in the psalm next to this, between the true
   God and the false gods which men form for themselves. This he does that
   the praise which he had ascribed might not be applied to any but the
   true God. Men are all ready to admit that they ought to celebrate the
   praises of God, but, naturally prone as they are to superstition, few
   indeed will be bound down to worship God in the manner which is right.
   No sooner have they to do with God than they deviate into the most
   baseless delusions. Each fashions a god for himself, and all choose
   what suits them best in the medley of inventions. This is the reason
   why the sacred writers, under the apprehension that men may turn to
   false gods, are careful in giving exhortations to the worship of God,
   to state at the same time who the true God is. The order observed by
   the Psalmist suggests the remark, that corrupt superstitions will never
   be removed until the true religion obtains. Prevented from coming to
   the true God by the slowness of their spiritual apprehension, men
   cannot fail to wander in vanities of their own; and it is the knowledge
   of the true God which dispels these, as the sun disperses the darkness.
   All have naturally a something of religion born with them, [100] but
   owing to the blindness and stupidity, as well as the weakness of our
   minds, the apprehension which we conceive of God is immediately
   depraved. Religion is thus the beginning of all superstitions, not in
   its own nature, but through the darkness which has settled down upon
   the minds of men, and which prevents them from distinguishing between
   idols and the true God. The truth of God is effectual when revealed in
   dispelling and dissipating superstitions. Does the sun absorb the
   vapors which intervene in the air, and shall not the presence of God
   himself be effectual much more? We need not wonder then that the
   Psalmist, in predicting the Kingdom of God, triumphs over the ungodly
   nations, which boasted in graven images, as when Isaiah, speaking of
   the rise of the Gospel, adds,

   "Then all the idols of Egypt shall fall," (Isaiah 19:1)

   Since the knowledge of God has been hid from the view of men, we are
   taught also that there is no reason to be surprised at the host of
   superstitions which have overspread the world. We have an
   exemplification of the same truth in our own day. The knowledge of the
   true doctrine is extinguished amongst the Turks, the Jews, and Papists,
   and, as a necessary consequence, they lie immersed in error; for they
   cannot possibly return to a sound mind, or repent of their errors, when
   they are ignorant of the true God. When the Psalmist speaks of their
   being confounded, he means that the time was come when those who were
   given to idolatry should repent, and return to the worship of the true
   God. Not that all without exception would be brought to genuine
   repentance, -- for experience has taught us in these our own times how
   atheistical men [101] will cast off superstition, and yet assume the
   most shameless effrontery, but that this is one of those consequences
   which the knowledge of God should effect, the turning of men from their
   errors unto God. Some there are who obstinately resist God, of which we
   have many examples in the Papacy; but we have every reason to believe
   that they are secretly prostrated by that which they affect to despise,
   and confounded notwithstanding their opposition. What the Psalmist says
   a little after, Let all the gods [102] worship before him, properly
   applies to the angels, in whom there shines forth some small portion of
   divinity, yet it may, though less appropriately, be extended to
   fictitious gods; as if he had said, Whatever is accounted or held as a
   god must quit its place and renounce its claims, that God alone may be
   exalted. Hence it may be gathered that the true definition of piety is,
   when the true God is perfectly served, and when he alone is so exalted,
   that no creature obscures his divinity; and, accordingly, if we would
   not have true piety entirely destroyed amongst us, we must hold by this
   principle, That no creature whatever be exalted by us beyond measure,

   8 Zion heard, and was glad In the former part of the psalm he had
   spoken of that joy which should be common to all the world. Now he
   makes special mention of God's chosen nation; and this partly, because
   they were to enjoy the first-fruits of this joy, and partly, because he
   would remove all occasion for rivalry or envy. Accordingly, having said
   that the Gentile nations should be brought to equal privileges with the
   posterity of Abraham, he adds, that the Jews would not suffer any
   diminution of honor by this co-partnership of privilege, but might
   rather reasonably rejoice in being chosen of God to be the fountain out
   of which the world was to be watered and refreshed. Those of whom the
   Psalmist speaks were the true children of Abraham and them only. They
   had a double reason for rejoicing, when God extended his government and
   glory from the rising to the setting sun; for, while he exhibited to
   them in Christ the complete fulfillment of that redemption which was
   promised, they, at the same time, saw the glory of God diffused from
   the narrow limits of Judea to all parts of the world. When the nations
   were blessed in the seed of Abraham, agreeably to the prediction which
   had gone before, this was no inconsiderable confirmation of their
   faith, as also, when they saw a religion which had been hated and
   despised universally embraced. But why, it may be asked, does he speak
   of those things being heard, rather than seen? Two reasons may be given
   for this. First, he would have God's believing people anticipate the
   blessing by hope, ere the consummation of it arrived; and, again, the
   language intimates, that the glory of the Gospel would be spread to
   such distant quarters, that the Jews would rather hear of it by report,
   than witness it with their own eyes.

   all the functions suited to such a character. The practice is familiar

   [102] With the exception of the Chaldee, which, instead of "gods," has
   "people," all the ancient versions translate angels -- all his angels,
   as if the Hebrew reading had originally been kl ml'kyv, and not as in
   our present copies kl 'lhym. It has indeed been questioned whether
   'lhym, elohim, can be correctly translated angels The most of modern
   lexicographers and critics reject this sense of the word. "But usage,
   after all," says Moses Stuart, "pleads in favor of it. The Septuagint
   render 'l (God) by angelos, in Job 20:15; and 'lhym by angeloi, in
   Psalm 8:6; 96:7; 137:1. Paul follows them by quoting Psalm 8:6 in
   Hebrews 2:7; and also by quoting Psalm 97:7 in Hebrews 1:6; i e.,
   supposing that he does actually quote it. Is not this sufficient
   evidence that there was a usus loquendi among the Jews, which applied
   the word 'lhym occasionally to designate angels? It is admitted that
   kings and magistrates are called elohim, because of their rank or
   dignity. Is there any thing improbable in the supposition that angels
   may be also called 'lhym, who at present are elevated above men,
   Hebrews 2:7?" Stuart, in the above remarks, speaks as if it were
   doubtful whether Paul in Hebrews 1:6, "And again, when he bringeth the
   first-begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God
   worship him," quotes from the 7th verse of the 97th Psalm. Commentators
   are divided in opinion on this point, some maintaining that the
   quotation is from Psalm 97, and others that it is from Deuteronomy
   32:43, in the Septuagint version, where the very words are found which
   appear in Hebrews 1:6, although only in that version; the Hebrew and
   all the ancient versions being without them. One difficulty attending
   the supposition of his quoting from Deuteronomy 32:43 is, that the
   subject connected with this command to the angels (if we admit the
   clause in the Septuagint to be a part of the sacred text) has no
   relation to the Messiah. The context celebrates the victory over the
   enemies of Israel, which God will achieve. After saying that his arms
   should be drunk with blood, and that his sword should devour flesh with
   the blood of the slain and of captives, from the time when he begins to
   take vengeance on the enemy,' the Septuagint (not the Hebrew)
   immediately inserts, euphranthete ouranoi hama auto kai prokunesatosan
   auto pantes angeloi theou. This in the place where it stands must mean,
   "Let the inhabitants of the heavenly world rejoice in the victory of
   God over the enemies of his people, and let them pay their adoration to
   him." But the Messiah does not seem to be at all alluded to any where
   in the context, much less described as being introduced into the world
   It is not therefore very likely that this is the passage quoted, unless
   we suppose that Paul borrowed the words merely as fitted to express the
   idea which he intended to convey, without any reference to their
   original meaning. The probability is in favor of a quotation from the
   text before us; which in the Septuagint runs thus: proskunesate auto
   pantes angeloi autou. Paul's words are, kai proskunesatosan auto pantes
   angeloi Theou. Here the variation from the Septuagint is so very
   inconsiderable, making no change upon the sense of the passage, that
   the discrepancy, especially when it is considered that very few of the
   quotations from the Old Testament in the New agree verbatim either with
   the Hebrew or Septuagint, is no argument against the supposition of the
   Apostle's quoting this text from that version which was in general use
   among the Jews. And this psalm admits of an easy application to the
   coming and kingdom of the Messiah, whose advent was to destroy
   idolatry, and be the source of rejoicing and happiness to all the
   righteous, which the passage in Deuteronomy referred to does not. --

   Psalm 97:9-12

   9. For thou, Jehovah, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
   far above all gods. 10. Ye that love Jehovah, hate evil: he preserveth
   the souls of his meek ones; he will deliver them out of the hand of the
   wicked. 11. Light has been sown for the righteous, and gladness for the
   upright in heart. 12. Rejoice in Jehovah, ye righteous, and celebrate
   the memory of his holiness.


   9 For thou, Jehovah, art high above all the earth Having already, in
   another place, explained these words, I shall not say more at present
   upon them. Only it is to be noticed, that there is a comparison drawn
   between God and the angels, and whatever has any claim to eminence. The
   Psalmist limits all other excellency in such a manner, as to leave no
   room for questioning that all majesty is comprehended in God only. This
   was the case more eminently when God manifested himself in his
   only-begotten Son, who is the express image of himself. Before that
   period his greatness was less apparent, because he was less known.

   10 Ye that love Jehovah, hate evil Those that fear God are here
   enjoined to practice righteousness, as Paul says,

   "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity,"
   (2 Timothy 2:19)

   He shows from the very nature of God, that we cannot be judged and
   acknowledged to be his servants unless we depart from sin, and practice
   holiness. God is in himself the fountain of righteousness, and he must
   necessarily hate all iniquity, unless we could suppose that he should
   deny himself; and we have fellowship with him only on the terms of
   separation from unrighteousness. As the persecution of the wicked is
   apt to provoke us to seek revenge, and unwarrantable methods of escape,
   the Psalmist guards us against this temptation, by asserting that God
   is the keeper and protector of his people. If persuaded of being under
   the Divine guardianship, we will not strive with the wicked, nor
   retaliate injury upon those who have wronged us, but commit our safety
   to him who will faithfully defend it. This gracious act of
   condescension, by which God takes us under his care, should serve as a
   check to any impatience we might feel in abstaining from what is evil,
   [103] and preserving the course of integrity under provocation.

   11. Light has been sown for the righteous He confirms the truth just
   advanced, and anticipates an objection which might be brought against
   it. We have seen that the Lord's people are often treated with the
   utmost cruelty and injustice, and would seem to be abandoned to the
   fury of their enemies. The Psalmist reminds us for our encouragement
   that God, even when he does not immediately deliver his children,
   upholds them by his secret power. [104] In the first clause of the
   verse there is a double metaphor. By light is meant joy, or a
   prosperous issue, (according to a phraseology which is common in
   Scripture,) as darkness denotes adversity. The latter metaphor of
   sowing is rather more difficult to understand. [105] Some think that
   gladness is sown for the just, as seed which, when cast into the
   ground, dies or lies buried in the earth a considerable time before it
   germinates. This idea may be a good one; but, perhaps, the simplest
   meaning of the words is the following, that though the righteous may be
   almost banished out of the world, and unable to venture themselves
   forth in public, and hidden from view, God will spread abroad their joy
   like seed, or bring forth to notice the light of their joy which had
   been shut up. The second clause of the verse is an exegesis of the
   first -- light being interpreted to mean joy, and the righteous such as
   are upright in heart This definition of righteousness is worthy of
   notice, That it does not consist in a mere outward appearance, but
   comprehends integrity of heart, more being required to constitute us
   righteous in God's sight than that we simply keep our tongue, hands, or
   feet, from wickedness. In the concluding verse he exhorts the Lord's
   people to gratitude, that looking upon God as their Redeemer, they
   should lead a life corresponding to the mercy they have received, and
   rest contented under all the evils they encounter, with the
   consciousness that they enjoy his protection.

   [104] "Quamvis non statim suos liberet Deus, arcana tamen virtute tucri

   [105] Walford objects to the version light is sown, on the ground that
   it presents an incongruous combination of figures; and he translates,
   "light is diffused." "Who can say," he remarks, "what is meant by the
   sowing of light? The diffusion or expansion of light is intelligible,
   and means that though good men may be in darkness or adversity, light
   and prosperity will burst through the cloud." The Septuagint, Vulgate,
   Arabic, and Æthiopic versions translate, "light is risen for the
   righteous," probably reading zrch, zarach, which De Rossi found in one
   manuscript, instead of zr, zara Houbigant and others adopt this
   reading, conceiving it to be more agreeable to the common idea of
   light. But Muis vindicates the text from Psalm 126:5; and Archbishop
   Secker thinks "sown" a very proper expression. In support of the same
   rendering, Merrick, in his Annotations, quotes several passages from
   the classic Greek authors, in which both light and gladness are said to
   be sown.

   PSALM 98

   This psalm has a great resemblance to the ninety-sixth, not only in
   matter, but language. The great scope of it is to show that the glory
   of God would be illustriously displayed in the spread of the knowledge
   of his name throughout the world, both from the more ample fulfillment
   which would be given upon the manifestation of the Savior, to the
   promises made to the posterity of Abraham, and from the sudden
   extension of salvation to all parts of the earth. He calls upon men to
   magnify the name of God on this account.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 98:1-3

   1. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, for he hath done marvelous things: his
   own right hand, and the arm of his holiness, hath gotten him the
   victory. [106] 2. Jehovah hath made known his salvation: his
   righteousness he hath revealed in the sight of the heathen. 3. He hath
   remembered his goodness and truth towards the house of Israel: all the
   ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. [107]


   1 Sing unto Jehovah a new song I have already remarked, that the
   expression here used denotes an extraordinary, not a common, ascription
   of praise. This appears from the reason assigned for it, That God had
   manifested his salvation in a singular and incredible manner. For
   having spoken of marvelous things, he represents this as the sum of
   all, that God had procured salvation with his own right hand; [108]
   that is, not by human means, or in an ordinary way, but delivering his
   Church in an unprecedented manner. Isaiah enlarges upon this miracle of
   God's power:

   "The Lord looked if there were any to help, and wondered that there was
   no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation, and his
   righteousness sustained him,"
   (Isaiah 59:16)

   In both passages the arm of God stands opposed to ordinary means, which
   although when employed they derogate nothing from the glory of God, yet
   prevent us from so fully discovering his presence as we might otherwise
   do. The language of the Psalmist amounts to a declaration that God
   would not save the world by means of an ordinary kind, but would come
   forth himself and show that he was the author of a salvation in every
   respect so singular. He reasonably infers that mercy of such a
   wonderful, and, to us, incomprehensible kind, should be celebrated by
   no ordinary measures of praise. This is brought out still more clearly
   in the verse which follows, where it is said that his salvation and
   righteousness are shown to the nations What could have been less looked
   for than that light should have arisen upon these dark and benighted
   places, and that righteousness should have appeared in the habitations
   of desperate wickedness? Salvation is mentioned first, although it is,
   properly speaking, the effect of righteousness. Such an inversion of
   the natural order is often observed in stating divine benefits; nor is
   it surprising that what is the means, and should be mentioned first, is
   sometimes set last, and follows by way of explanation. I may add, that
   the righteousness of God, which is the source of salvation, does not
   consist in his recompensing men according to their works, but is just
   the illustration of his mercy, grace, and faithfulness.

   3 He hath remembered his goodness Having spoken of the general
   manifestation of his salvation, he now celebrates his goodness more
   particularly to his own chosen people. God exhibited himself as a
   Father to Gentiles as well as Jews; but to the Jews first, who were, so
   to speak, the first-born. [109] The glory of the Gentiles lay in their
   being adopted and in-grafted into the holy family of Abraham, and the
   salvation of the whole world sprung from the promise made to Abraham,
   as Christ said, "Salvation is of the Jews," (John 4:22) The Psalmist
   therefore very properly observes, that God in redeeming the world
   remembered his truth, which he had given to Israel his people --
   language, too, which implies that he was influenced by no other motive
   than that of faithfully performing what he had himself promised. [110]
   The more clearly to show that the promise was not grounded at all on
   the merit or righteousness of man, he mentions the goodness of God
   first, and afterwards his faithfulness, which stood connected with it.
   The cause, in short, was not to be found out of God himself, (to use a
   common expression,) but in his mere good pleasure, which had been
   testified long before to Abraham and his posterity. The word remembered
   is used in accommodation to man's apprehension; for what has been long
   suspended seems to have been forgotten. Upwards of two thousand years
   elapsed from the time of giving the promise to the appearance of
   Christ, and as the people of God were subjected to many afflictions and
   calamities, we need not wonder that they should have sighed, and given
   way to ominous fears regarding the fulfillment of this redemption. When
   it is added, all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of God,
   this is not merely commendatory of the greatness of the salvation,
   meaning that it should be so illustrious that the report of it would
   reach the ends of the earth; but it signifies that the nations formerly
   immersed in delusions and superstitions would participate in it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [106] The last clause is "literally, have wrought deliverance for him,
   i e., not deliverance of him, as if God had been himself in danger or
   distress; but that is done for any one, which is done agreeably to his
   wishes and intentions, and at his instigation. The original, therefore,
   expresses, that the deliverance wrought was originally designed and
   decreed by God, and that his immediate power effected the thing
   intended without any other aid." -- Horsley Street translates, "hath
   wrought salvation for us." He thinks that instead of lv, for him, we
   should read lnv, for us

   [107] The last part of this verse is in the same words with Isaiah
   52:10.

   Psalm 98:4-9

   4. Exult before Jehovah all the earth; make a loud noise, and rejoice,
   and sing praise. 5. Sing to Jehovah upon the harp, upon the harp, and
   with the voice of a psalm. [111] 6. With trumpets, and sound of the
   cornet, sing before Jehovah the King. 7. Let the sea roar, and the
   fullness thereof; the world, and those who dwell therein. [112] 8. Let
   the floods clap their hands: [113] let the hills be joyful together, 9.
   Before Jehovah: for he cometh to judge the earth; with righteousness
   shall he judge the world, and the people with uprightness.


   4 Exult before Jehovah all the earth Here he repeats the exhortation
   with which he had begun, and by addressing it to the nations at large,
   he indicates that when God should break down the middle wall of
   partition all would be gathered to the common faith, and one Church
   formed throughout the whole world. When he speaks of musical
   instruments the allusion is evidently to the practice of the Church at
   that time, without any intention of binding down the Gentiles to the
   observance of the ceremonies of the law. The repetition made use of is
   emphatical, and implies that the most ardent attempts men might make to
   celebrate the great work of the world's redemption would fall short of
   the riches of the grace of God. This is brought out still more forcibly
   in what follows, where feeling is ascribed to things inanimate. The
   whole passage has been elsewhere expounded, and it is unnecessary to
   insist further upon it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [111] Horsley reads -- "Chant unto Jehovah to the harp,
   To the harp, and the sound of the zimrah." "zmrh here," he remarks, "as
   in Psalm 81:2, is certainly the name of some musical instrument. But
   what the particular instrument might be, which went by that name, is
   quite uncertain. I therefore retain the Hebrew word."

   [112] Street is of opinion that the nominative cases of the concluding
   part of this verse do not belong to the verb of the preceding clause,
   but to the verb in the subsequent verse. "Roar let the globe," says he,
   "and those that inhabit it,' is not so proper an expression as Let the
   globe and those that inhabit it clap the hand.'"

   [113] "Let the floods clap their hands," is a most beautiful
   prosopopoeia, a figure for which the Hebrew poets are remarkable, and
   which they manage with equal elegance and boldness. Horsley renders,
   "Let the floods sound applause;" observing, that it is literally "clap
   their hands." "The verb rnn," he adds, "expresses the vibratory motion,
   either of a dancer's feet, or of a singer's lip. Therefore, when
   applied figuratively to an inanimate thing that can neither dance nor
   sing, it is better to render its general sense than to confine it to
   either particular image. Our language has no word, which, like the
   Hebrew, may express dancing or singing indiscriminately." The propriety
   of deviating from the literal rendering may, however, be questioned.
   This ode is highly animated; it is a burst of joy in God raised to the
   highest pitch; and it is the property of this emotion, when felt in a
   high degree, to express itself in the most daring and unusual figures.
   It may be added, that the whole of the seventh and eighth verses
   furnish a beautiful specimen of personification. With a sublimity of
   sentiment and an energy of language which cannot be surpassed, all
   nature, animate and inanimate, is summoned to unite in the song of joy,
   and to contend with eager rivalry in celebrating the praises of its
   Creator.

   PSALM 99

   This psalm differs from those which precede it in one respect, that it
   speaks of the kingdom of God, and the blessings consequent upon it, as
   confined within Judea; and rather calls upon the posterity of Abraham,
   in distinction from the surrounding nations, to praise God for the
   privilege of their adoption.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 99:1-4

   1. Jehovah reigns; let the people tremble: he dwells between the
   cherubim; let the earth be moved. 2. Jehovah is great in Zion; and he
   is high above all nations. 3. They shall acknowledge thy great and
   terrible name; it is holy. 4. The king's strength [114] also loves
   judgment; thou hast established equity, thou hast done judgment and
   righteousness in Jacob.


   1 Jehovah reigns The people, who were formerly called upon to rejoice,
   are now commanded to tremble. For as the Jews were encompassed by
   enemies, it was of the utmost importance that God's power should be
   magnified among them, that they might know that, while under his
   guardianship, they would be constantly and completely safe from the
   hatred and fury of every foe. The Hebrew word rgz, ragaz, as we have
   elsewhere seen, sometimes signifies to tremble, at other times, to be
   angry, and, in short, denotes any strong emotion arising either from
   anger or fear. [115] Accordingly, the prophet here intends that God, in
   the emancipation of his chosen people, should give such a palpable
   display of his power, as would strike all the nations with dismay, and
   make them feel how madly they had rushed upon their own destruction.
   For it is with regard to men that God is said to reign, when he exalts
   himself by the magnificent displays which he gives of his power;
   because, while the aid which he gives to them remains invisible,
   unbelievers act a more presumptuous part, just as if there were no God.

   2 Jehovah in Zion It is proper that we should not forget the antithesis
   I formerly mentioned, namely, that God is great in Zion to destroy and
   annihilate all the enemies of his Church; and that, when the Psalmist
   goes on to say, he is high above all nations, his meaning is, not that
   he presides over them to promote their welfare, but to disconcert their
   counsels, to baffle their designs, and to subvert all their power. That
   which immediately follows about the praising of God's name, refers not
   to the nations at large, but in my opinion to the faithful, from whom
   alone the prophet demands a tribute of gratitude. For although God
   compels his vanquished enemies to acknowledge him, yet as they do not
   cease from speaking against his glory, and blaspheming his holy name,
   it cannot be to them that the exhortation is addressed, Praise the name
   of God, for it is holy; but to the faithful, who, from their knowledge
   of God's holy name, very cordially engage in the celebration of its
   praises.

   4 The king's strength also loves judgment This may be viewed as a
   threatening designed to fill his enemies with dismay; as if he should
   say, such is God's regard for righteousness and equity, that he hath
   clothed himself with power to avenge the injuries which his enemies
   have done to him. I think it preferable, however, to apply it to the
   Church, because she is under the government of God for the express
   purpose [116] of practicing righteousness and holiness. There is
   another interpretation which is by no means objectionable, namely, that
   which does not associate ideas of tyranny with the government of God,
   because there is constant concord between his power and justice. But
   when I consider the whole context, I have no doubt, that the prophet,
   after having introduced God as established upon his royal throne, now
   speaks of the manner in which he governs his kingdom; for he adds, thou
   hast established equity and righteousness. This clause is susceptible
   of two interpretations; either that God in his law has commanded his
   people to practice perfect equity, or that, in supporting and defending
   them, he has uniformly testified his great regard for his justice and
   equity. It is most true that the highest equity has always
   characterized the works and judgments of God, yet it appears more
   probable that it refers to that system, that form of government which
   God, who loves justice, appointed among the people of Israel, and which
   was the best rule for leading a life of honesty and integrity. And
   hence the word to do is improperly taken to signify to order or
   command. Should any one choose to consider this last clause as relating
   to God's government, I am by no means disposed to disagree with him.
   For there is nothing that more animates and encourages the faithful to
   render obedience to God, or inspires them with greater zeal to observe
   his law, than to find in this course of action that they are the
   objects of his paternal care, and that the righteousness, which he
   requires from his own people in words, is on his part reciprocated by
   kind deeds.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [114] "The king's strength seems here put for the king himself." --
   Merrick Street removes the original word for strength to the end of the
   preceding verse, reading holy and mighty; and renders the first part of
   this verse thus: "Thou art a king that lovest judgment;" observing,
   that, in the Hebrew it is mlk, melech, not hmlk, hamelech, that the
   word 'hv, aheb, that lovest, is a participle here, and that the pronoun
   'th, atah, thou, belongs to the first clause. "According to the
   translation of the English Bible," says he, "there is a great want of
   connection. The king's strength also loveth judgment: thou dost
   establish equity,' etc. There had been no king spoken of before except
   Jehovah, and the Psalmist is here addressing him in the second person,
   not speaking of him in the third."

   [115] rgz, ragaz, "denoting commotion either of the body or mind,
   imports in the latter acceptation particularly two things, fear and
   anger, those two principal emotions of the mind. In the sense of anger
   we have it in Genesis 45:24, where we render it falling out or
   quarrelling, and in 2 Kings 19:27, 28, where we render it rage So,
   Proverbs 29:9, and in Genesis 41:10, the Hebrew qtsph, (affirmed of
   Pharaoh, viz., that) he was wroth, is by the Chaldee rendered rgz. And
   this is much the more frequent acceptation of the word in the Old
   Testament." -- Hammond's note on Psalm 4:4. On the text before us,
   after observing that Abu Walid explains this root as signifying in the
   Arabic trembling and commotion, arising sometimes from anger, sometimes
   from fear, and other causes, the same critic says, "Here the context
   may seem to direct the taking it in the notion of commotion simply, as
   that signifies akatastasia, sedition or tumult of rebels or other
   adversaries. And then the sense will be thus: The Lord reigneth, let
   the people be moved,' i e., Now God hath set up David in his throne,
   and peaceably settled the kingdom in him, in spite of all the
   commotions of the people. The LXX. render it to this sense, as Psalm
   4:4, orgizesthosan, let the people be angry or regret it as much as
   they will.'" The verb here, and the concluding verb of the verse, may
   be read in the future tense: "The people or nations shall tremble, and
   the earth shall be moved," just as at the giving of the Law, "the
   people trembled," and "the earth shook." Thus the passage may be
   regarded as a prediction of the subjection of the heathen world to the
   dominion of Christ.

   Psalm 99:5-9

   5. Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship at his footstool; he [117] is
   holy. 6. Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who
   call upon his name; they called upon Jehovah, and he answered them. 7.
   He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: [118] they kept his
   testimonies, and the statute which he gave them. 8. O Jehovah our God,
   thou wast a God that wast favorable to them, though thou didst take
   vengeance upon their inventions. 9. Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship
   at his holy mountain; for Jehovah our God is holy.


   5 Exalt Jehovah our God This exhortation is properly addressed to the
   Church alone, because having been made a partaker of the grace of God,
   she ought the more zealously to devote herself to his service, and to
   the love of godliness. The Psalmist, therefore, calls upon the Jews to
   exalt that God from whom they had received such manifest help, and
   enjoins them to render that worship appointed in his Law. The temple
   indeed is frequently in other places denominated God's seat, or house,
   or rest, or dwelling-place; here it is called his footstool, and for
   the use of this metaphor, there is the best of all reasons. For God
   desired to dwell in the midst of his people in such a manner, as not
   only to direct their thoughts to the outward temple and to the ark of
   the covenant, but rather to elevate them to things above. Hence the
   term house or dwelling-place tended to impart courage and confidence to
   them, that all the faithful might have boldness to draw near unto God
   freely, whom they beheld coming to meet them of his own accord.

   But as the minds of men are prone to superstition, it was necessary to
   check this propensity, lest they should associate with their notions of
   God things fleshly and earthly, and their thoughts should be wholly
   engrossed by the outward forms of worship. The prophet, therefore, in
   calling the temple God's footstool, desires the godly to elevate their
   thoughts above it, for he fills heaven and earth with his infinite
   glory. Nevertheless, by these means he reminds us that true worship can
   be paid to God no where else than upon mount Zion. For he employs a
   style of writing such as is calculated to elevate the minds of the
   godly above the world, and, at the same time, does not in the least
   degree detract from the holiness of the temple, which alone of all
   places of the earth God had chosen as the place where he was to be
   worshipped. From this we may see, since the days of Augustine, how
   vainly many perplex themselves in endeavoring to ascertain the reason
   for the prophet ordering God's footstool to be worshipped. The answer
   of Augustine is ingenious. If, says he, we look to Christ's manhood, we
   will perceive a reason why we may worship the footstool of God, and yet
   not be guilty of idolatry; for that body in which he wishes to be
   worshipped he took from the earth, and on this earth nothing else than
   God is worshipped, for the earth is both the habitation of Deity, and
   God himself condescended to become earth. All this is very plausible,
   but it is foreign to the design of the prophet, who, intending to
   distinguish between legal worship, (which was the only worship that God
   sanctioned,) and the superstitious rites of the heathen, summons the
   children of Abraham to the temple, as if to their standard, there,
   after a spiritual manner, to worship God, because he dwells in
   celestial glory.

   Now that the shadowy dispensation has passed away, I believe that God
   cannot otherwise be properly worshipped, than when we come to him
   directly through Christ, in whom all the fullness of the Godhead
   dwells. It were improper and absurd for any one to designate him a
   footstool. For the prophet merely spake in this manner to show that God
   was not confined to the visible temple, but that he is to be sought for
   above all heavens, [119] inasmuch as he is elevated above the whole
   world.

   The frantic bishops of Greece, in the second Council of Nice, very
   shamefully perverted this passage, when they endeavored to prove from
   it that God was to be worshipped by images and pictures. The reason
   [120] assigned for exalting Jehovah our God, and worshipping at his
   footstool, contains an antithesis: he is holy For the prophet, in
   hallowing the name of the one God, declares all the idols of the
   heathen to be unholy; as if he should say, Although the heathen claim
   for their idols an imaginary sanctity, they are nevertheless very
   vanity, an offense, and abomination. Some translate this clauses for it
   is holy; but it will appear from the end of the psalm that it was the
   design of the prophet by this title to distinguish God from all idols.

   6. Moses and Aaron. The Psalmist magnifies the special grace which God
   in a very remarkable manner vouchsafed to the seed of Abraham, that
   thence he chose for himself prophets and priests to be, as it were,
   mediators between him and the people, to ratify the covenant of
   salvation. And he mentions three persons who were famous in former
   times. For Moses was, as it were, a mediator to reconcile the people
   unto God. Aaron was invested with the same office; and, subsequently,
   Samuel sustained the same character. There is no doubt, however, that
   under these three persons he included all the people with whom God had
   made a covenant. But he mentions the names of those who were the
   depositaries and guardians of this invaluable treasure. It may appear
   improper that he should speak of Moses as among the priests, since his
   sons were only among the common Levites, and that Moses himself, after
   the giving of the law, never held the office of high priest. But as the
   Hebrews call kvhnym, chohanim, those who are chief and very eminent
   personages, [121] such as kings' sons, there is nothing to prevent the
   prophet from giving this designation to Moses, as if he had said that
   he was one of the holy rulers of the Church. [122] Moreover, if we go
   back to the first original -- to the period prior to the publication of
   the law, it is certain that Moses was then invested with the high
   priest's office. The design of the prophet must also be kept in mind,
   namely, that God not only adopted the seed of Abraham, but set apart
   some of them to act as mediators, whom he enjoined to call upon his
   name, in order that his covenant might be the more confirmed. For the
   invocation of which he speaks must not be understood indiscriminately
   of every manner of calling upon, but only of that which belongs to the
   priests, who were chosen by God, as intercessors to appear in his
   presence in the name of all the people, and to speak on their behalf.

   They called upon Jehovah The Psalmist explains more fully what I have
   just now said, that God from the very first, and with a special
   reference to his gracious covenant, bestowed great benefits upon the
   descendants of Abraham -- the Jews. And, therefore, as often as they
   experienced the loving-kindness of God, it behooved them to call to
   mind his former loving-kindness. The prophet, too, makes particular
   mention of the visible symbol of the cloudy pillar, by which God
   designed to testify in all ages that his presence was ever with his
   people, according as he employed temporal signs, not only for their
   benefit to whom they were exhibited, but also for the benefit of those
   who were to succeed them. Not that God always showed a cloudy pillar to
   his ancient people, but considering that the dullness of men is so
   great, that they do not perceive the presence of God unless they are
   put in mind by external signs, the prophet very properly reminds the
   Jews of this memorable token. And as God had appeared openly in the
   desert to their fathers, so their posterity might be well assured that
   he would also be near to them. He adds, that they had kept God's
   testimonies, for the purpose of enforcing the duty of like obedience
   upon succeeding generations.

   8. O Jehovah our God The prophet here reminds them that God had heard
   their prayers because his grace and their piety harmonized.
   Consequently, encouraged by their exemplary success in prayer, their
   posterity ought to call upon God, not merely pronouncing his name with
   their lips, but keeping his covenant with all their heart. He farther
   reminds us that if God does not display his glory so bountifully, and
   so profusely in every age, the fault is with men themselves, whose
   posterity have either utterly forsaken, or greatly declined from the
   faith of the fathers. It is not to be wondered at that God should
   withdraw his hand, or at least not stretch it forth in any remarkable
   way, when he beholds piety waxing cold on the earth.

   O God, thou hast been propitious to them. [123] From these words it is
   quite obvious that what the Psalmist had formerly said concerning
   Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, refers to the whole people; for surely they
   did not officiate as priests merely for their own benefit, but for the
   common benefit of all the Israelites. Hence the transition is more
   natural which he makes from these three to the remaining body of the
   people. For I neither restrict the relative, to these three persons,
   nor do I interpret them exclusively of the same, but I rather think
   that the state of the whole Church is pointed out; namely, that while
   God, at the prayers of the priests, was propitious to the Jews, he, at
   the same time, sharply punished them for their sins. For on the one
   hand, the prophet magnifies the grace of God in that he had treated the
   people so kindly, and had so mercifully forgiven their iniquity; on the
   other hand, he specifies those awful examples of punishment by which he
   punished them for their ingratitude, that their descendants might learn
   to submit themselves dutifully to him. For it must not be forgotten,
   that by how much God deals graciously with us, by so much will he the
   less easily endure that we should treat his liberality with scorn.

   In the close of the psalm he repeats the same sentence which we had in
   the fifth verse, only substituting his holy mountain instead of his
   footstool; and as for the sake of brevity he had formerly said somewhat
   obscurely qdvs hv', kadosh hu, he is holy, he now says more plainly,
   Jehovah our God is holy His intention is to show that God is not to be
   worshipped by the Israelites at random, (as the religion of the heathen
   depended upon fancy alone,) but that his worship is founded upon the
   assurance of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [117] The marginal translation in our English Bible is, it is holy,
   connecting holy with Jehovah's footstool, mentioned in the preceding
   clause. This construction appears to be very appropriate. The third,
   the fifth, and in effect the ninth verses, end with this expression,
   which seems to be a kind of chorus, and thus divides the psalm into
   three parts. The first part terminates with ascribing holiness to the
   name of Jehovah; the second with attributing the same property to his
   abode; and at the conclusion, holiness, essential, infinite, and
   immutable holiness, is ascribed to Jehovah himself.

   [118] That God spoke to Moses and Aaron out of the cloudy pillar, there
   is no doubt. In Exodus 16:10, 11, we read, "And it came to pass as
   Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that
   they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord
   appeared in the cloud. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying," etc. And
   when God said to Moses, Exodus 17:6, "Behold, I will stand before thee
   there upon the rock in Horeb," The meaning undoubtedly is, that the
   cloudy pillar, from which he was to speak, would stand upon Horeb. See
   also Exodus 19:9, 18, 19. To this intercourse Aaron as well as Moses
   was admitted, as we learn from the 24th verse of that chapter, and from
   Exodus 20:21, 22. The only difficulty here is, how God can be said to
   have spoken to Samuel out of the cloudy pillar, of which we have no
   particular account in his history. To this it may be answered, that
   when God called upon Samuel four times successively, at the fourth time
   he "came and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel,"
   (verse 10,) which seems parallel to those words of God to Moses, Exodus
   17:6, "I will stand before thee upon the rock," and may, therefore, be
   presumed to mean that the cloud, the usual emblem of the Divine
   presence under the former dispensation, came and stood before Samuel,
   and that God spake from it, though it is evident that at the three
   preceding calls it did not appear. Again, when Samuel's offerings and
   prayers were so signally heard at Mizpeh, 1 Samuel 7, it is said, verse
   9, "The Lord answered him," and verse 10, "The Lord thundered with a
   great thunder;" and as where thunder is, a cloud is supposed to exist,
   this answering of Samuel with thunder may not unreasonably be supposed
   to denote God's speaking to him at this time also out of the cloud.

   -- Fr.

   [122] Accordingly, some instead of priests read princes, or chief men
   khn, kchn, to minister, is a common title of civil as well as
   ecclesiastical officers. Hence, in Exodus 2:16, for the Hebrew term
   khn, the Chaldee has rv', "the Prince of Midian." And in 2 Samuel 8:18,
   it is said of David's sons, that they were khnym, which does not there
   mean priests, but princes or chief rulers; -- rvrvyn, great men, as the
   Chaldee has it, or hr'svnym, "principal or chief men about the king,"
   as they are termed in 1 Chronicles 18:17. Of this sort was Ira the
   Jairite, who, in 2 Samuel 20:26, is called khn, which does not there
   denote priest, but a chief ruler about David. Thus, as in the more
   general sense of the word, it comprehends civil as well as
   ecclesiastical rulers, it is evident that Moses, no less than Aaron,
   may be reckoned vkhnyv, among God's rulers or chief men; and, as Calvin
   states, it is to be noticed that Moses was, properly speaking, the
   Priest of the Israelites before the appointment of Aaron and his family
   to the sacerdotal office.

   [123] Hammond translates, "O God, thou was propitiated for their
   sakes." He observes, that lhm, lahem, which Calvin renders to them, is
   not to be understood barely in the sense of the dative case, "thou wast
   propitiated to them," or "forgavest them;" but means for them, that is,
   for their sakes: God sparing the people, for or on account of the
   prayers of Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. God did not destroy them when
   these holy and devoted men pleaded with him in their behalf; he spared
   them, and drew back the hand of vengeance in answer to prayer. Such was
   the effect of Moses' intercessions. When the people caused Aaron to
   make the golden calf and worshipped it, God's anger was kindled against
   them. And he said to Moses, "Now therefore, let me alone, that my wrath
   may wax hot, and that I may consume them, and I will make of thee a
   great nation." Had Moses let God alone, the whole of that race would
   have been utterly consumed. But he pleaded with God in their behalf,
   and "the Lord repented him of the evil which he thought to do unto the
   people," Exodus 22:10-15. Nor was Aaron less prevalent in turning away
   the anger of God from the rebellious Israelites, as is evident from
   Numbers 16:43-45. When, on the occasion of the rebellion and murmuring
   of the people at Moses and Aaron on account of what befell Korah and
   his company, God said to Moses, "Get thee up from among this
   congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment;" Moses and Aaron
   "fell upon their faces," and prayed. Then it follows, verse 46, "And
   Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the
   altar; and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and
   make an atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from the Lord;
   the plague is begun. And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into
   the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among
   the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the
   people. And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague
   was stayed." Equally successful were the intercessions of Samuel. When
   the Israelites were sore pressed by the Philistines, and afraid of
   them, they "said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for
   us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines." Samuel
   did as they desired, and God was propitiated by his prayers: "Samuel
   took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt-offering wholly unto
   the Lord; and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel, and the Lord
   answered him." -- 1 Samuel 7:7, 8, 9

   PSALM 100

   The title of this psalm may serve for a summary of its contents
   Moreover, its brevity renders a lengthened discourse unnecessary. The
   Psalmist, in an especial manner, invites believers to praise God,
   because he has chosen them to be his people, and has taken them under
   his care.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 100:1-3

   A Psalm of Praise

   1. Let all the earth make a joyful noise to Jehovah. 2. Serve Jehovah
   with gladness: come into his presence with joyfulness. 3. Know ye that
   Jehovah himself is God: he made us, and not we ourselves: we are his
   people, and the sheep of his pasture.


   1 Make a joyful noise The Psalmist refers only to that part of the
   service of God which consists in recounting his benefits and giving
   thanks. And since he invites the whole of the inhabitants of the earth
   indiscriminately to praise Jehovah, he seems, in the spirit of
   prophecy, to refer to the period when the Church would be gathered out
   of different nations. Hence he commands (verse 2) that God should be
   served with gladness, intimating that his kindness towards his own
   people is so great as to furnish them with abundant ground for
   rejoicing. This is better expressed in the third verse, in which he
   first reprehends the presumption of those men who had wickedly revolted
   from the true God, both in fashioning for themselves gods many, and in
   devising various forms of worshipping them. And as a multitude of gods
   destroys and suppresses the true knowledge of one God only, and
   tarnishes his glory, the prophet, with great propriety, calls upon all
   men to bethink themselves, and to cease from robbing God of the honor
   due to his name; and, at the same time, inveighs against their folly in
   that, not content with the one God, they were become vain in their
   imaginations. For, however much they are constrained to confess with
   the mouth that there is a God, the maker of heaven and earth, yet they
   are ever and anon gradually despoiling him of his glory; and in this
   manner, the Godhead is, to the utmost extent of their power, reduced to
   a nonentity. As it is then a most difficult thing to retain men in the
   practice of the pure worship of God, the prophet, not without reason,
   recalls the world from its accustomed vanity, and commands them to
   recognize God as God. For we must attend to this short definition of
   the knowledge of him, namely, that his glory be preserved unimpaired,
   and that no deity be opposed to him that might obscure the glory of his
   name. True, indeed, in the Papacy, God still retains his name, but as
   his glory is not comprehended in the mere letters of his name, it is
   certain that there he is not recognized as God. Know, therefore, that
   the true worship of God cannot be preserved in all its integrity until
   the base profanation of his glory, which is the inseparable attendant
   of superstition, be completely reformed.

   The prophet next makes mention of the great benefits received from God,
   and, in an especial manner, desires the faithful to meditate upon them.
   To say God made us is a very generally acknowledged truth; but not to
   advert to the ingratitude so usual among men, that scarcely one among a
   hundred seriously acknowledges that he holds his existence from God,
   although, when hardly put to it, they do not deny that they were
   created out of nothing; yet every man makes a god of himself, and
   virtually worships himself, when he ascribes to his own power what God
   declares belongs to him alone. Moreover, it must be remembered that the
   prophet is not here speaking of creation in general, (as I have
   formerly said,) but of that spiritual regeneration by which he creates
   anew his image in his elect. Believers are the persons whom the prophet
   here declares to be God's workmanship, not that they were made men in
   their mother's womb, but in that sense in which Paul, in Ephesians
   2:10, calls them, To poiema, the workmanship of God, because they are
   created unto good works which God hath before ordained that they should
   walk in them; and in reality this agrees best with the subsequent
   context. For when he says, We are his people, and the sheep of his
   pasture, he evidently refers to that distinguishing grace which led God
   to set apart his children for his heritage, in order that he may, as it
   were, nourish them under his wings, which is a much greater privilege
   than that of merely being born men. Should any person be disposed to
   boast that he has of himself become a new man, who is there that would
   not hold in abhorrence such a base attempt to rob God of that which
   belongs to him? Nor must we attribute this spiritual birth to our
   earthly parents, as if by their own power they begat us; for what could
   a corrupt seed produce? Still the majority of men do not hesitate to
   claim for themselves all the praise of the spiritual life. Else what
   mean the preachers of free-will, unless it be to tell us that by our
   own endeavors we have, from being sons of Adam, become the sons of God?
   In opposition to this, the prophet in calling us the people of God,
   informs us that it is of his own good will that we are spiritually
   regenerated. And by denominating us the sheep of his pasture, he gives
   us to know that through the same grace which has once been imparted to
   us, we continue safe and unimpaired until the end. It might be
   otherwise rendered, he made us his people, etc. [124] But as the
   meaning is not altered, I have retained that which was the more
   generally received reading.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [124] The Hebrew text has a keri, which is vlv 'nchnv, "and we are
   his," instead of vl' 'nchnv "and not ourselves." The Septuagint
   supports the latter reading, the ketib, kai ouch hemeis, "and not we
   ourselves;" in which it is followed by the Syriac and Vulgate versions.
   Jerome agrees with the keri, Ipse fecit nos, et ipsius sumus; and so
   does the Chaldee. "I am persuaded," says Lowth, in Merrick's
   Annotations, "that the Masoretical correction, vlv, (and we are his,)
   is right: the construction and parallelism both favour it."

   Psalm 100:4-5

   4. Enter into his gates with praise, and into his courts with
   rejoicing: give glory [125] to him, and bless his name. 5. Because
   Jehovah is good, his mercy endureth for ever, and his truth from
   generation to generation.


   4 Enter his gates The conclusion of the psalm is almost the same as the
   beginning of it, excepting that he adopts a mode of speech which
   relates to the worship of God which obtained under the law; [126] in
   which, however, he merely reminds us that believers, in rendering
   thanks to God, do not discharge their duty aright, unless they also
   continue in the practice of a steady profession of piety. Meanwhile,
   under the name of the temple, he signifies that God cannot be otherwise
   worshipped than in strict accordance with the manner prescribed in his
   law. And, besides, he adds, that God's mercy endureth for ever, and
   that his truth also is everlasting, to point out to us that we can
   never be at a loss for constant cause of praising him. If, then, God
   never ceases to deal with us in this manner, it would argue the basest
   ingratitude on our part, if we wearied in rendering to Him the tribute
   of praise to which he is entitled. We have elsewhere taken notice of
   the reason why truth is connected with mercy. For so foolish are we,
   that we scarcely feel the mercy of God while he openly manifests it,
   not even in the most palpable displays of it, until he open his holy
   lips to declare his paternal regard for us.

   PSALM 101

   David was not as yet put in possession of the kingdom, but having been
   already created king by the appointment of God, he prepares himself for
   exercising the government in the best manner. And he not only stirs up
   himself to perform faithfully the duties of his kingly office by
   devoutly meditating on this subject, but also engages by a solemn vow
   to be God's faithful servant, in order to induce Him to put him
   speedily in possession of the kingdom.

   Psalm 101:1-5

   A Psalm of David.

   1. I will sing of mercy and of judgment: unto thee, O Jehovah! will I
   sing psalms. 2. I will behave myself prudently in a perfect way, till
   thou comest to me: [127] I will walk in the integrity of my heart in
   the midst of thy house. 3. I will not set a wicked thing before my
   eyes: I hate the work [128] of those who turn aside; it shall not
   adhere to me. 4. The perverse heart shall depart from me: I will not
   know evil [129] 5. Whoso slandereth his neighbor in secret, him will I
   destroy: the man whose eyes are lofty, and whose heart is wide, I
   cannot endure.


   1 I will sing of mercy and of judgment What David here says concerning
   singing must be understood by the reader as intimating that this psalm
   contains the substance of his meditations with himself, as to what kind
   of king he would be whenever he should be put in possession of the
   sovereign power which had been promised him. To sing therefore of mercy
   and of judgment, is equivalent to declaring in solemn terms, that he
   would be a just and an upright king. Augustine understands this as
   meaning that God is to be praised, whether he punish men with severity,
   or whether he show himself merciful to them; but this interpretation is
   too refined. David does not speak of God's secret judgments, but of the
   due administration of the kingdom, that he might both by words and
   deeds fulfill his vocation. When he asserts, Unto thee, O Jehovah! will
   I sing psalms, he acknowledges that it was by the favor of God that he
   was appointed to so distinguished and honorable an office; for it would
   have been an act of presumptuous rashness for him to have thrust
   himself into it, at the mere impulse of his own mind. He very properly
   comprehends all princely virtues under these two particulars, mercy and
   judgment; for as it is the principal duty of a king to yield to every
   man his own right, so he is also required to possess a considerate love
   and compassion towards his subjects. Solomon therefore justly says,
   (Proverbs 16:12) "The throne is established by righteousness."

   2 I will behave myself prudently in a perfect way David here shows that
   he carefully considered how weighty a charge was laid upon him when he
   was made king. We know, and it is a truth taught us by experience, that
   almost all kings are intoxicated with the splendors of royalty; and the
   proverb was not used without foundation in ancient times, "A king must
   be born either a king or a fool." It is indeed a mistake to say that
   kings are born fools. Men were led to speak in this manner, because it
   commonly happens that those who are invested with the government of
   kingdoms and empires are fools and blockheads. And surely it is a
   remarkable instance of the vengeance of God, that beasts, and such as
   are altogether unworthy to be numbered among men, commonly possess the
   highest authority. But although kings are not born fools, yet they are
   so blinded by their dignity, that they think themselves in no respect
   indebted to their subjects, become arrogant and haughty in their
   carriage, recklessly plunge into their pleasures, and at length utterly
   forget themselves. David therefore says, I will behave myself
   prudently, or, which amounts to the same thing, I will look warily to
   myself; it being a rare virtue for the man who may do as he pleases to
   exercise such moderation, as not to allow himself liberty in any degree
   to do evil. He then who is exalted to sovereign power, and yet, instead
   of attempting to go as far as he can in doing mischief, restrains
   himself by self-control, is endued with true understanding. In short,
   David protests that he will not be like other kings who are infatuated
   by their own dignity; but that according to the greatness of the charge
   imposed upon him, he would endeavor wisely to perform his duty. It is
   to be observed, that he represents wisdom as consisting in a perfect
   way, or in uprightness. From this we learn that tyrants who employ
   their talents in forming wicked devices, and who are daily contriving
   new methods for burdening and oppressing their subjects; in short, who
   are ingenious only in doing mischief, are not wise towards God. Many
   persons, it is true, dislike such craftiness; but still, it is
   undeniable that, if kings are intent upon enlarging the boundaries of
   their kingdom, and are masters in refined policy for accomplishing such
   a purpose, this is accounted the most perfect wisdom which they can
   possess, and is extolled to the skies. David, on the contrary, covets
   no other wisdom but that which is the mistress of integrity. Till thou
   comest to me These words may be read in two ways. Some translate them
   interrogatively, When wilt thou come? as if David besought God not to
   subject him to any longer delay. And truly he had just ground to groan
   and lament, when he saw himself so long oppressed with poverty, and
   driven from place to place a wretched exile. It had been better for him
   to have lived obscure and unnoticed in his father's cottage, following
   his former occupation as a shepherd, than to be anointed king, that,
   being driven out of his country, he might live in utter dishonor and
   hatred. But I prefer reading the sentence without interrogation, until
   or when thou comest; and yet even this I interpret somewhat differently
   from the majority of commentators, understanding it to mean, that
   although David still continued in the condition of a private person,
   and did not enjoy the royal power which had been promised him, he
   nevertheless did not cease in the meantime to follow after uprightness.
   Thus he sets the midst of his house in opposition to palaces and public
   buildings; as if he had said, Within my private house or in my family.

   3 I will not set a wicked thing before my eyes After having protested,
   that in leading a private life, he would practice virtue and
   righteousness, even as it becomes good princes to begin with this, he
   now adds, that in executing the office of prince, he will be the enemy
   of all injustice and wickedness. To set a wicked thing before one's
   eyes, is equivalent to purposing to do something that is wicked. He
   therefore declares, that he will turn away from all wickedness; and it
   is certain, that no man can be a just and an impartial punisher of
   wrongdoing, but he who abhors it with all his heart. Whence it follows
   that kings, in order to the performance of their duty, must keep
   themselves entirely free from all consent to wickedness. Some join to
   the first sentence the word svh, asoh, which we translate work, and
   supply the letter l, lamed; as if it had been said, I will not set
   before my eyes any wickedness to do it, or, nothing wicked will be
   acceptable to me to execute it. But the other sense is more probable,
   which is, that David, after having declared that he will not suffer any
   iniquity before his eyes, immediately adds for the sake of
   confirmation, that he will be an enemy to all injustice. If the last
   clause is referred to the persons who turn aside, there is a change of
   the number. It may, however, be explained of the work itself, implying
   that he would never have any share in wicked defections from the path
   of rectitude.

   4 The perverse heart shall depart from me Some by perverse heart
   understand perfidious men; but this I reject as a sense too forced, and
   it is moreover inconsistent with the context. As David has added in the
   second clause by way of exposition, I will not know evil, he doubtless
   in the first protests that he will be free from all perfidiousness and
   wickedness. The amount is, that he will do his endeavor to keep himself
   from all wrong-doing, and that he will not even know what it is to do
   wrong to his neighbors.

   5 Whoso slandereth his neighbor [130] in secret, him will I destroy. In
   this verse he speaks more distinctly of the duty of a king who is armed
   with the sword, for the purpose of restraining evil-doers. Detraction,
   pride, and vices of every description, are justly offensive to all good
   men; but all men have not the power or right to cut off the proud or
   detractors, because they are not invested with public authority, and
   consequently have their hands bound. It is of importance to attend to
   this distinction, that the children of God may keep themselves within
   the bounds of moderation, and that none may pass beyond the province of
   his own calling. It is certain, that so long as David lived merely in
   the rank of a private member of society, he never dared to attempt any
   such thing. But after being placed on the royal throne, he received a
   sword from the hand of God, which he employed in punishing evil deeds.
   He particularises certain kinds of wickedness, that under one species,
   by the figure synecdoche, he might intimate his determination to punish
   all sorts of wickedness. To detract from the reputation of another
   privily, and by stealth, is a plague exceedingly destructive. It is as
   if a man killed a fellow-creature from a place of ambush; or rather a
   calumniator, like one who administers poison to his unsuspecting
   victim, destroys men unawares. It is a sign of a perverse and
   treacherous disposition to wound the good name of another, when he has
   no opportunity of defending himself. This vice, which is too prevalent
   every where, while yet it ought not to be tolerated among men, David
   undertakes to punish.

   He next characterises the proud by two forms of expression. He
   describes them as those whose eyes are lofty, not that all who are
   proud look with a lofty countenance, but because they commonly betray
   the superciliousness of their proud hearts by the loftiness of their
   countenance. He farther describes them as wide [131] of heart, because
   those who aspire after great things must necessarily be puffed up and
   swollen. They are never satisfied unless they swallow up the whole
   world. From this we learn that good order cannot exist, unless princes
   are sedulously on the watch to repress pride, which necessarily draws
   after it and engenders outrage and cruelty, contemptuous language,
   rapine, and all kinds of ill treatment. Thus it would come to pass,
   that the simple and the peaceable would be at the mercy of the more
   powerful, did not the authority of princes interfere to curb the
   audacity of the latter. As it is the will of God that good and faithful
   kings should hold pride in detestation, this vice is unquestionably the
   object of his own hatred. What he therefore requires from his children
   is gentleness and meekness, for he is the declared enemy of all who
   strive to elevate themselves above their condition.

   Psalm 101:6-8

   6. My eyes are towards the faithful of the land, that they may dwell
   with me: he who walketh in an upright way shall minister to me. 7. He
   who worketh [or practiseth] deceit shall not dwell in the midst of my
   house: he who speaketh falsehoods shall not abide in my sight. 8. Early
   [132] will I destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all
   the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.


   6 My eyes are towards the faithful of the land David here lays down
   another virtue of a wise prince, when he affirms that it will be his
   care to make all the faithful of the land his intimate friends, -- that
   he will avail himself of their good offices, and have as domestic
   servants such only as are distinguished for personal worth. Some
   understand the words, that they may dwell with me, in a general sense
   thus: I will not neglect the good and inoffensive, nor will I suffer
   them to be unjustly molested; but I will secure, that under my
   administration, they shall live in a state of peace and tranquillity.
   But his meaning rather is, that he will exercise discretion and care,
   that, instead of taking persons into his service indiscriminately, he
   may wisely determine each man's character, so as to have those who live
   a life of strict integrity as his most intimate friends, and that he
   may intrust them with the offices of state. He speaks of the faithful
   in the first place, because, although a man may possess talents of a
   high order, yet if he is not devoted to fidelity and integrity, he will
   never rightly execute the office of a judge. This is worthy of special
   notice; for although a prince may be the best of men, yet if his
   servants and officers are not of a corresponding character his subjects
   will experience hardly any advantage from his uncorrupted integrity.
   Servants are the hands of a prince, and whatever he determines for the
   good of his subjects they will wickedly overthrow it, provided they are
   avaricious, fraudulent, or rapacious. This has been more than
   sufficiently demonstrated by experience. The greater part of kings,
   indeed, passing over the good and the upright, or, which is worse,
   driving them away from them, purposely seek to have as servants those
   who are like themselves, and who may prove fit tools for their tyranny;
   yea, even good and well disposed princes often manifest so much
   indolence and irresolution as to suffer themselves to be governed by
   the worst counsels, and inconsiderately prostitute the offices of state
   by conferring them on the unworthy.

   7 He who worketh deceit shall not dwell in the midst of my house This
   verse may be explained of all magistrates to whose charge the exercise
   of public judgments is committed, as well as of household servants. But
   as David has just now spoken in general of all officers, he seems now
   to speak properly of those who are near the person of the king. When
   the chief counsellors of kings and other intimate acquaintances who
   have gained possession of their ears, are deceitful and crafty, this
   becomes the source of all corruptions; for by their example they
   encourage others in evil, lifting up as it were the banner of
   licentiousness. And it is impossible that he who does not maintain good
   order in his own house, can be a fit person for holding the government
   of a whole realm. The authority which cannot preserve its influence
   under the domestic roof is of little worth in state affairs.

   8 Early will I destroy all the wicked of the land The Psalmist at
   length concludes by asserting, that he will endeavor to the utmost of
   his power to purge the land from infamous and wicked persons. He
   affirms that he will do this early; for if princes are supine and
   slothful, they will never seasonably remedy the evils which exist. They
   must therefore oppose the beginnings of evil. The judge, however, must
   take care not to yield to the influence of anger, nor must he act
   precipitately and without consideration. The original word for early is
   in the plural number, (it being properly at the mornings,) which
   denotes unremitted exertion. It were not enough that a judge should
   punish the wicked sharply and severely in one or two instances: he must
   continue perseveringly in that duty. By this word is condemned the
   slothfulness of princes, when, upon seeing wicked men daringly break
   forth into the commission of crime, they connive at them from day to
   day, either through fear or an ill-regulated lenity. Let kings and
   magistrates then remember, that they are armed with the sword, that
   they may promptly and unflinchingly execute the judgments of God.
   David, it is true, could not purge the land from all defilements,
   however courageously he might have applied himself to the task. This he
   did not expect to be able to do. He only promises, that without respect
   of persons he will show himself an impartial judge, in cutting off all
   the wicked. Timidity often hinders judges from repressing with
   sufficient rigor the wicked when they exalt themselves. It is
   consequently necessary for them to be endued with a spirit of
   invincible fortitude, that relying upon Divine aid, they may perform
   the duties of the office with which they are invested. Moreover,
   ambition and favor sometimes render them pliant, so that they do not
   always punish offenses alike, where this ought to be done. Hence we
   learn that the strictness, which is not carried to excess, is highly
   pleasing to God; and, on the other hand, that he does not approve of
   the cruel kindness which gives loose reins to the wicked; as, indeed,
   there cannot be a greater encouragement to sin than for offenses to be
   allowed to pass unpunished. What Solomon says should therefore be
   remembered, (Proverbs 17:15) "He that justifieth the wicked, and he
   that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord."
   What David adds, That I may cut off all the workers of iniquity from
   the city of God, is also emphatic. If even heathen kings are commanded
   in common to punish crimes, David well knew that he was under
   obligations of a more sacred kind to do so, since the charge of the
   Church of God had been committed to him. And certainly if those who
   hold a situation so honorable do not exert themselves to the utmost of
   their power to remove all defilements, they are chargeable with
   polluting as much as in them lies the sanctuary of God; and they not
   only act unfaithfully towards men by betraying their welfare, but also
   commit high treason against God himself. Now as the kingdom of David
   was only a faint image of the kingdom of Christ, we, ought to set
   Christ before our view; who, although he may bear with many hypocrites,
   yet as he will be the judge of the world, will at length call them all
   to an account, and separate the sheep from the goats. And if it seems
   to us that he tarries too long, we should think of that morning which
   will suddenly dawn, that all filthiness being purged away, true purity
   may shine forth.

   Courts of judicature for the execution of public justice were wont to
   be held in the morning in ancient times, as they are still with us, or
   at least began then, and continued till the evening. Hugo Grotius and
   others think there is here an allusion to these courts. "To this," says
   Hammond, "most probably lvqrym in the plural, in the mornings, here
   refers, the season wherein David, as a judge entering the tribunal,
   destroys and cuts off the wicked doers. The former part of the psalm
   contains his resolution for choice of counsellors and officers of
   state, preferring the plain, honest, and not the subtlest contrivers;
   and this last for the execution of justice, discountenancing and
   judicially cutting off all wicked men."

   PSALM 102

   This prayer seems to have been dictated to the faithful when they were
   languishing in captivity in Babylon. Sorrowful and humbled, they first
   bewail their afflictions. In the next place, they plead with God for
   the restoration of the holy city and temple. To encourage themselves to
   come before him in prayer with the greater confidence, they call to
   remembrance the Divine promises in reference to the happy renovation
   both of the kingdom and of the priesthood; and they not only assure
   themselves of deliverance from captivity, but also beseech God to bring
   kings and nations in subjection to himself. In the close of the psalm,
   after having interposed a brief complaint concerning their distressing
   and afflicted condition, they draw consolation from the eternity of
   God; for, in adopting his servants to a better hope, he has separated
   them from the common lot of men.

   A prayer for the afflicted, when he shall be shut up, and shall pour
   out his meditation before Jehovah.

   Whoever of the prophets composed this psalm, it is certain that he
   dictated it to the faithful as a form of prayer for the
   re-establishment of the temple and the city. Some limit it to the time
   when, after the return of the Jews from Babylon, the building of the
   temple was hindered by the neighboring nations; but with this I cannot
   agree. I am rather of opinion that the poem was written before the
   return of the people, when the time of their promised deliverance was
   just at hand; for then the prophets began to be more earnest in lifting
   up the hearts of the godly according to these words of Isaiah, (Isaiah
   40:1) "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God." [133] The
   design of the sacred poet was, not only to inspire the people with
   courage, but also to excite in them greater care about the welfare of
   the Church. The title of the psalm indicates the end and purpose which
   it was intended to serve. Those who translate the verbs in the past
   tense, A prayer for the afflicted, when he was in distress, and poured
   out his meditation, [134] seem to give an incorrect view of the mind of
   the prophet. He rather intended to relieve the sorrow of those whose
   hearts he saw depressed; as if he had said, Although you may be
   afflicted with anguish and despair, you must not on that account desist
   from prayer. Some translate the verb tph, ataph, when he shall hide
   himself, and conceive that this is a metaphorical expression of the
   gesture of a man engaged in prayer, when, on account of his grief,
   unable to lift up his face, he, as it were, hides himself, and keeps
   his head wrapped up in his bosom. But there appears to me to be an
   elegant play upon the words, when the distresses of the mind, and its
   being shut up, are spoken of, on the one hand, and the pouring out of
   prayers on the other; teaching us that, when we are so shut up by grief
   as to shun the light and presence of men, the gate is so far from being
   shut against our prayers, that then in truth is the most proper season
   for engaging in prayer, for it is a singular alleviation of our sorrows
   when we have opportunity freely to pour out our hearts before God. The
   verb svch, suach, often denotes to pray; but, as it also signifies to
   meditate, the noun derived from it properly means, in this place,
   meditation. It is, moreover, to be observed that, by these words, the
   Psalmist admonishes the Israelites as to the frame of mind with which
   it became them to use this form of prayer at the throne of grace; as if
   he had said, that he prescribed it to those only who were distressed on
   account of the desolate condition of the Church.

   Psalm 102:1-2

   1. O Jehovah! hear my prayer, and let my cry come to thee. 2. Hide not
   thy face from me in the day of my affliction; incline thy ear to me: in
   the day when I cry make haste, answer me.


   1 O Jehovah! hear my prayer This earnestness shows, again, that these
   words were not dictated to be pronounced by the careless and
   light-hearted, which could not have been done without grossly insulting
   God. In speaking thus, the captive Jews bear testimony to the severe
   and excruciating distress which they endured, and to the ardent desire
   to obtain some alleviation with which they were inflamed. No person
   could utter these words with the mouth without profaning the name of
   God, unless he were, at the same time, actuated by a sincere and
   earnest affection of heart. We ought particularly to attend to the
   circumstance already adverted to, that we are thus stirred up by the
   Holy Spirit to the duty of prayer in behalf of the common welfare of
   the Church. Whilst each man takes sufficient care of his own individual
   interests, there is scarcely one in a hundred affected as he ought to
   be with the calamities of the Church. We have, therefore, the more need
   of incitements, even as we see the prophet here endeavoring, by an
   accumulation of words, to correct our coldness and sloth. I admit that
   the heart ought to move and direct the tongue to prayer; but, as it
   often flags or performs its duty in a slow and sluggish manner, it
   requires to be aided by the tongue. There is here a reciprocal
   influence. As the heart, on the one hand, ought to go before the words,
   and frame them, so the tongue, on the other, aids and remedies the
   coldness and torpor of the heart. True believers may indeed often pray
   not only earnestly but also fervently, while yet not a single word
   proceeds from the mouth. There is, however, no doubt that by crying the
   prophet means the vehemence into which grief constrains us to break
   forth.

   2 Hide not thy face from me in the day of my affliction The prayer,
   that God would not hide his face, is far from being superfluous. As the
   people had been languishing in captivity for the space of nearly
   seventy years, it might seem that God had for ever turned away his
   favor from them. But they are, notwithstanding, commanded, in their
   extreme affliction, to have recourse to prayer as their only remedy.
   They affirm that they cry in the day of their affliction, not as
   hypocrites are accustomed to do, who utter their complaints in a
   tumultuous manner, but because they feel that they are then called upon
   by God to cry to him.

   Make haste, answer me Having elsewhere spoken more fully of these forms
   of expression, it may suffice, at present, briefly to observe, that
   when God permits us to lay open before him our infirmities without
   reserve, and patiently bears with our foolishness, he deals in a way of
   great tenderness towards us. To pour out our complaints before him
   after the manner of little children would certainly be to treat his
   Majesty with very little reverence, were it not that he has been
   pleased to allow us such freedom. I purposely make use of this
   illustration, that the weak, who are afraid to draw near to God, may
   understand that they are invited to him with such gentleness as that
   nothing may hinder them from familiarly and confidently approaching
   him.

   Psalm 102:3-7

   3. For my days are consumed like smoke [135] and my bones are burnt up
   as a hearth. [136] 4. My heart is smitten, and withered like grass,
   because I have forgotten to eat my bread. 5. By reason of the voice of
   my groaning, my bones cleave to my flesh. [137] 6. I have become like a
   pelican [138] of the wilderness; I have become like an owl [139] of the
   deserts. 7. I have watched, and have been like a sparrow which is alone
   upon the house-top. [140]


   3 For my days are consumed like smoke These expressions are
   hyperbolical, but still they show how deeply the desolation of the
   Church ought to wound the hearts of the people of God. Let every man,
   therefore, carefully examine himself on this head. If we do not prefer
   the Church to all the other objects of our solicitude, we are unworthy
   of being accounted among her members. Whenever we meet with such forms
   of expression as these, let us remember that they reproach our
   slothfulness in not being affected with the afflictions of the Church
   as we ought. The Psalmist compares his days to smoke, and his bones to
   the stones of the hearth, which, in the course of time, are consumed by
   the fire. By bones he means the strength of man. And, were not men
   devoid of feeling, such a melancholy spectacle of the wrath of God
   would assuredly have the effect of drying up their bones, and wasting
   away their whole rigor.

   4 My heart is smitten, and dried up like grass Here he employs a third
   similitude, declaring that his heart is withered, and wholly dried up
   like mown grass. But he intends to express something more than that his
   heart was withered, and his bones reduced to a state of dryness. His
   language implies, that as the grass, when it is cut down, can no longer
   receive juice from the earth, nor retain the life and rigor which it
   derived from the root, so his heart being, as it were, torn and cut off
   from its root, was deprived of its natural nourishment. The meaning of
   the last clause, I have forgotten to eat my bread, is, My sorrow has
   been so great, that I have neglected my ordinary food. The Jews, it is
   true, during their captivity in Babylon, did eat their food; and it
   would have been an evidence of their having fallen into sinful despair,
   had they starved themselves to death. But what he means to say is, that
   he was so afflicted with sorrow as to refuse all delights, and to
   deprive himself even of food and drink. True believers may cease for a
   time to partake of their ordinary food, when, by voluntary fasting,
   they humbly beseech God to turn away his wrath, but the prophet does
   not here speak of that kind of abstinence from bodily sustenance. He
   speaks of such as is the effect of extreme mental distress, which is
   accompanied with a loathing of food, and a weariness of all things. In
   the close of the verse, he adds, that his body was, as it were,
   consuming or wasting away, so that his bones clave to his skin.

   6 I have become like a pelican of the wilderness Instead of rendering
   the original word by pelican, some translate it bittern, and others the
   cuckoo. The Hebrew word here used for owl is rendered by the Septuagint
   nuktikorax, which signifies a bat. [141] But as even the Jews are
   doubtful as to the kind of birds here intended, let it suffice us
   simply to know, that in this verse there are pointed out certain
   melancholy birds, whose place of abode is in the holes of mountains and
   in deserts, and whose note, instead of being delightful and sweet to
   the ear, inspires those who hear it with terror. I am removed, as if he
   had said, from the society of men, and am become almost like a wild
   beast of the forest. Although the people of God dwelt in a well
   cultivated and fertile region, yet the whole country of Chaldea and
   Assyria was to them like a wilderness, since their hearts were bound by
   the strongest ties of affection to the temple, and to their native
   country from which they had been expelled. The third similitude, which
   is taken from the sparrow, denotes such grief as produces the greatest
   uneasiness. The word tsphvr, tsippor, signifies in general any kind of
   bird; but I have no doubt that it is here to be understood of the
   sparrow. It is described as solitary or alone, because it has been
   bereaved of its mate; and so deeply affected are these little birds
   when separated from their mates, that their distress exceeds almost all
   sorrow. [142]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [135] Hammond reads, "My days are consumed in the smoke." "The Syriac,"
   says he, "read, in smoke, and so the sense will best bear, either my
   days or time of my life, klv, consume and wither in smoke, as Psalm
   119:83, a bottle in the smoke, afflictions have had the same effect on
   me as smoke on those things which are hung in it, dried me up, and
   deformed me: or perhaps klv, end or fail, or consume in smoke, (as when
   any combustible matter is consumed, smoke is all that comes from it,
   and so it ends in that;) and to that the latter part of the verse may
   seem to incline it, And my bones, or members, or body, are burnt up,'
   that being all one with consumed."

   [136] Hammond reads, "are burnt up as dry wood." "As for kmvqd, that is
   added," says he, "the interpreters differ in the understanding of it.
   The word coming from yqd, accensus est, may be either the place where
   the fire is, or the pot which is heated by the flame of the fire, or
   the wood which is set on fire. The Syriac seems to take it in the first
   notion, rendering it, my bones are grown white as the hearth,' for so
   the chimney or hearth doth with the fire constantly burning on it. The
   Chaldee reads, as one of the stones that is set under the pot or
   caldron.' But the LXX. read, hosei phruchion, as dry wood,' and the
   Latin, sicut cremium, as dry combustible wood,' and that is most
   applicable to the matter in hand; the bones or members of the body,
   their being burnt up as dry wood denotes the speedy exhausting of the
   radical moisture, which soon ends in the consumption of the whole. And
   then the whole verse fitly accords, My days are withered away in the
   smoke,' or perhaps end in smoke, my bones are burnt up like dry wood.'"

   [137] "Tienent a ma peau." -- Fr. "Cleave to my skin." Flesh is more
   literal; but see Psalm 119:120, and Job 19:20.

   [138] The pelican is a bird of the desert, to which frequent allusion
   is made by the sacred writers. Its Hebrew name q't, kaath, literally
   means, the vomiter, being derived from the verb qv', ko, to vomit It
   has a large pouch, or bag, suspended from its bill and throat, which
   serves both as a repository for its food, and as a net for catching it.
   In feeding its young ones, whether this bag is loaded with water, or
   more solid food, it squeezes the contents of it into their mouths, by
   strongly compressing it upon its breast with its bill, an action which
   might well explain the origin of the name given to it by the Hebrews.
   It is a bird of solitary habits, and is said by Isidore to live "in the
   solitude of the river Nile:" indeed, it generally builds its nest in
   mossy, turfy places, in the islands of rivers or lakes, far from the
   abode of man. It is here described as living in the wilderness, a
   circumstance not inconsistent with its natural fondness for water; for
   lakes, as well as fountains, are to be found in the most desert parts.
   And although a water-fowl, it sometimes retires to a great distance
   from the water, where, in some remote and concealed situation, it may
   hatch its young with greater security. Its huge pouch, which is said to
   be capable of containing near the size of a man's head, seems to be
   given to it for the purpose of its being provided with a supply of food
   for itself and its young ones when at a distance from the water.
   Bochart thinks that q't, kaath, here means the bittern His chief reason
   for this opinion is, that the Psalmist compares himself to the two
   birds specified, on account of his groaning, and that, therefore, both
   of them should have a mournful cry. But he finds that natural
   historians make no mention of this as a property of the pelican,
   whereas they all agree that the bittern, by inserting its bill in the
   mud of the marsh, or plunging it under water, utters a most
   disagreeable cry, like the roaring of a bull, or the sound of distant
   thunder. But the Psalmist may not so much compare his groaning to the
   plaintive cry of these birds, as compare his situation to their
   solitary condition. Sorrow, when pungent, drives the sufferer to
   solitude, and, on this occasion, the inspired bard, under the
   overwhelming pressure of grief, seems to have become weary of society,
   and, like the pelican, or the owl, to have contracted a relish for deep
   retirement. Shaw's Travels, volume 2, page 302; Paxton's Illustrations
   of Scripture, volume 2, pages 247-250.

   [139] The owl, it is highly probable, is the bird here intended. The
   original word kvs, kos, which is evidently derived from the verb ksh,
   kasah, to hide, is applied, with much propriety, to denote that bird,
   which constantly hides itself in the day-time, and comes abroad only in
   the evening, or at night. kvs, kos, is followed in construction by
   chrvvt, charaboth, which comes from chrv, charab, to be destroyed, or
   laid waste; (Isaiah 60:12; Jeremiah 26:8; Zephaniah 3:6) and signifies
   a waste or desolate place, as the ruins of an uninhabited house. The
   proper translation, then, should be, not the owl of the desert, but the
   owl of the desolate or ruined buildings, which exactly corresponds with
   the habits of this bird; for such ruinous places, as is well known, are
   its ordinary haunt, where, in undisturbed solitude, it may utter its
   melancholy howlings. The allusion in Gray's celebrated Elegy may
   illustrate the language of the text, -- "Save that from yonder ivy
   mantled tower,
   The moping owl does to the night complain," etc. The habit of the owl
   in shunning the light of day, and delighting in solitude, well
   describes the sensitiveness with which the Psalmist, through the
   greatness of his grief, shrunk from society, and courted seclusion.
   Bochart contends that kvs here signifies, not the owl, but the ostrich,
   and, if the Psalmist is comparing himself to the two birds specified,
   on account of his groaning, this seems to favor that translation; for
   the female ostrich has a most dismal and mournful voice, very much
   resembling the lamentation of a human being in deep distress. But, as
   has been before observed, the Psalmist seems to refer, not so much to
   the mournful voice of these birds, as to their solitary condition.

   [140] There is here a reference to the flat roof of the eastern houses,
   a usual place of retirement, in ancient times, and even at this day, to
   the inhabitants of these countries.

   [141] "La translation Grecque ha Nicticorax qui est Chauvesouris." --
   Fr.

   [142] Although Calvin expresses himself as having no doubt that the
   sparrow is here intended, the most eminent expositors are of a
   different opinion, contending that it is difficult to reconcile with
   the nature of the sparrow the ideas of wakefulness and solitude which
   the Psalmist represents as characteristic of the bird to which he
   compares himself. The sparrow is not a solitary moping bird which sits
   mournfully on the housetop, nor so timid as to betake itself to the
   darkest corners for concealment, and to spend the live long night in
   sleepless anxiety. It is gregarious, is commonly found chirping and
   fluttering about in the crowd, a pert, loquacious, and bustling
   creature, and builds its nest in the habitations of men. Every part of
   the description leads to the supposition that some nocturnal bird is to
   be understood, which from instinct hates the light, and comes forth
   from its hiding-place only when the shadows of the evening fall to hunt
   its prey, and from amidst the fragments, of some mouldering ruin to
   attract the attention of mankind by its mournful voice. Accordingly, it
   has been thought that the Psalmist refers to some species of the owl,
   distinguished for its plaintive cry and solitary disposition. --
   Paxton's Illustrations of Scripture, volume 2, pages 355-357. "But,"
   says Merrick, "as chos, mentioned in the preceding verse, seems also to
   signify an owl, we are perhaps to suppose two sorts of owls intended,
   one of which confines itself to deserts or ruinous places, and the
   other sometimes approaches cities or villages, and according to
   Virgil's description, (which Bochart quotes as conformable to that of
   the Psalmist,) sits alone on the house-top. Solaque culminibus ferali
   carmine bubo Visa queri, et longas in fletum ducere voces.'
   Æneid, lib. 4. 50. 462. I doubt whether the Psalmist would in two
   verses together compare his situation to that of the very same bird,
   with no other difference than that of its sitting in the desert in one
   verse, and on the house-top in the other." Bochart thinks that the
   screech-owl is intended. The reason which Calvin assigns for the
   sparrow being called solitary, namely, because of the extreme sorrow
   which she feels when deprived of her mate, does not agree with the
   natural history of that bird; for, unlike the turtle, who, on losing
   her spouse, remains in a state of inconsolable widowhood, she accepts
   without reluctance the first companion that solicits her affections.

   Psalm 102:8-11

   8. My enemies have reviled me daily; and those who are mad against me
   have sworn by me. [143] 9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and
   mingled my drink with weeping, [or, with my tears,] 10. On account of
   thy indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me
   down. 11. My days are like a shadow which declineth; and I am dried up
   like the grass.


   8. My enemies have reviled me daily The faithful, to excite the
   compassion of God towards them, tell him that they are not only objects
   of mockery to their enemies, but also that they swore by them. The
   indignity complained of is, that the ungodly so shamefully triumphed
   over God's chosen people, as even to borrow from their calamities a
   form of swearing and imprecation. This was to regard the fate of the
   Jews as a signal pattern in uttering the language of imprecation. When,
   therefore, at the present day the ungodly, in like manner, give
   themselves loose reins in pouring forth against us contumelious
   language, let us learn to fortify ourselves with this armor, by which
   such kind of temptation, however sharp, may be overcome. The Holy
   Spirit, in dictating to the faithful this form of prayer, meant to
   testify that God is moved by such revilings to succor his people; even
   as we find it stated in Isaiah 37:23,

   "Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed, and against whom hast thou
   exalted thy voice? even against the Holy One of Israel;"

   and in the verse immediately preceding the prophet had said, "He hath
   despised thee, O daughter of Zion! against thee hath he shaken the
   head, O daughter of Jerusalem!" It is surely an inestimable comfort
   that the more insolent our enemies are against us, the more is God
   incited to gird himself to aid us. In the second clause the inspired
   writer expresses more strongly the cruelty of his enemies, when he
   speaks of their being mad against him As the verb hll, halal, which we
   have rendered mad, generally signifies to praise, it might here be
   understood as having, by the figure antiphrasis, a sense the very
   opposite -- those who dispraised or reproached me. But it is better to
   follow the commonly received interpretation. Some maintain that they
   are called mad, because they manifested their own folly, making it
   evident from the manner in which they acted, that they were worthless
   persons; but this opinion does too much violence to the text. The more
   satisfactory sense is, that the people of God charge revilers with
   cruelty or furious hatred.

   9 For I have eaten ashes like bread Some think that the order is here
   inverted, and that the letter k, caph, the sign of similitude, which is
   put before lchm, lechem, the word for bread, ought to be placed before
   'phr, epher, the word for ashes; as if it had been said, I find no more
   relish for my bread than I do for ashes; and the reason is, because
   sorrow of heart produces loathing of food. But the simpler meaning is,
   that lying prostrate on the ground, they licked, as it were, the earth,
   and so did eat ashes instead of bread. It was customary for those who
   mourned to stretch themselves at full length with their faces on the
   ground. The prophet, however, intended to express a different idea --
   to intimate, that when he partook of his meals, there was no table set
   before him, but his bread was thrown upon the ground to him in a foul
   and disgusting manner. Speaking, therefore, in the person of the
   faithful, he asserts that he was so fixed to the ground that he did not
   even rise from it to take his food. The same sentiment is expressed in
   the last part of the verse, I have mingled my drink with weeping; for
   while mourners usually restrain their sorrow during the short time in
   which they refresh themselves with food, he declares that his mourning
   was without intermission. Some, instead of reading in the first clause,
   as bread, read, in bread; [144] and as the two letters, k, caph, and v,
   beth, nearly resemble each other, I prefer reading in bread, which
   agrees better with the second clause.

   10. On account of thy anger and thy wrath He now declares that the
   greatness of his grief proceeded not only from outward troubles and
   calamities, but from a sense that these were a punishment inflicted
   upon him by God. And surely there is nothing which ought to wound our
   hearts more deeply, than when we feel that God is angry with us. The
   meaning then amounts to this -- O Lord! I do not confine my attention
   to those things which would engage the mind of worldly men; but I
   rather turn my thoughts to thy wrath; for were it not that thou art
   angry with us, we would have been still enjoying the inheritance given
   us by thee, from which we have justly been expelled by thy displeasure.
   When God then strikes us with his hand, we should not merely groan
   under the strokes inflicted upon us, as foolish men usually do, but
   should chiefly look to the cause that we may be truly humbled. This is
   a lesson which it would be of great advantage to us to learn.

   The last clause of the verse, Thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down,
   may be understood in two ways. As we lift up what we intend to throw
   down with greater violence against the ground, the sentence may denote
   a violent method of casting down, as if it had been said, Thou hast
   crushed me more severely by throwing me down headlong from on high,
   than if I had merely fallen from the station which I occupied. [145]
   But this seems to be another amplification of his grief, nothing being
   more bitter to an individual than to be reduced from a happy condition
   to extreme misery, the prophet mournfully complains that the chosen
   people were deprived of the distinguished advantages which God had
   conferred upon them in time past, so that the very remembrance of his
   former goodness, which should have afforded consolation to them,
   embittered their sorrow. Nor was it the effect of ingratitude to turn
   the consideration of the divine benefits, which they had formerly
   received, into matter of sadness; since they acknowledged that their
   being reduced to such a state of wretchedness and degradation was
   through their own sins. God has no delight in changing, as if, after
   having given us some taste of his goodness, he intended forthwith to
   deprive us of it. As his goodness is inexhaustible, so his blessing
   would flow upon us without intermission, were it not for our sins which
   break off the course of it. Although, then, the remembrance of God's
   benefits ought to assuage our sorrows, yet still it is a great
   aggravation of our calamity to have fallen from an elevated position,
   and to find that we have so provoked his anger, as to make him withdraw
   from us his benignant and bountiful hand. Thus when we consider that
   the image of God, which distinguished Adam, was the brightness of the
   celestial glory; and when, on the contrary, we now see the ignominy and
   degradation to which God has subjected us in token of his wrath, this
   contrast cannot surely fail of making us feel more deeply the
   wretchedness of our condition. Whenever, therefore, God, after having
   stripped us of the blessings which he had conferred upon us, gives us
   up to reproach, let us learn that we have so much the greater cause to
   lament, because, through our own fault, we have turned light into
   darkness.

   11. My days are like the shadow which declineth [146] When the sun is
   directly over our heads, that is to say, at mid-day, we do not observe
   such sudden changes of the shadows which his light produces; but when
   he begins to decline towards the west the shadows vary almost every
   moment, This is the reason why the sacred writer expressly makes
   mention of the shadow which declineth What he attributes to the
   afflicted Church seems indeed to be equally applicable to all men; but
   he had a special reason for employing this comparison to illustrate the
   condition of the Church when subjected to the calamity of exile. It is
   true, that as soon as we advance towards old age, we speedily fall into
   decay. But the complaint here is, that this befell the people of God in
   the very flower of their age. By the term days is to be understood the
   whole course of their life; and the meaning is, that the captivity was
   to the godly as the setting of the sun, because they quickly failed. In
   the end of the verse the similitude of withered grass, used a little
   before, is repeated, to intimate that their life during the captivity
   was involved in many sorrows which dried up in them the very sap of
   life. Nor is this wonderful, since to live in that condition would have
   been worse than a hundred deaths had they not been sustained by the
   hope of future deliverance. But although they were not altogether
   overwhelmed by temptation, they must have been in great distress,
   because they saw themselves abandoned by God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [143] Horsley renders the concluding sentence, -- "And the profligate
   make me their standard of execration." "Houbigant," says he, "rightly
   observes, that the verb nsv, governing its objects by the prefix v,
   signifies to swear by, not to swear against. For nsvv, therefore, he
   would substitute another word; which, however, bears not the sense he
   would impose upon it. Archbishop Secker attempts to explain the text as
   it stands, but, in my judgment, unsuccessfully, unless nsv may signify
   to execrate one's self or another. I find no example of this use of the
   verb. But the [use] of the noun in Numbers 5:21, and Isaiah 65:15, may
   seem, in some degree, to countenance the Archbishop's interpretation.
   The other passages to which he refers are little to the purpose."
   Rosenmüller gives a similar interpretation. "They swear by me; they
   derive their arguments and examples from my calamities; when they mean
   to imprecate evil on themselves as the persons swearing, or on another
   as the object of their malediction, they use my name as a form of
   execration, as if they said, Let our fate be that of these miserable
   Jews, if we speak what is false.' -- See Isaiah 65:15; Jeremiah 29:22."

   [144] Supposing the reading to be vlchm, balechem, instead of klchm,
   calechem; and from the similarity in form between the letters v and k,
   transcribers might readily have mistaken the latter for the former.

   [145] "What is meant by ns'tny, thou hast lifted me up,' etc., is to be
   judged by the immediate antecedents, indignation and wrath; by these is
   meant vehement displeasure and anger, and in God, in whom anger is not
   found, effects that bear analogy with those which proceed from angry
   men. To such it is ordinary to cast to the ground any thing that they
   are displeased with, and where the displeasure is vehement, to lift it
   up first as high as they can, that they may cast it down with more
   violence, and dash it in pieces by the fall. And this is the meaning of
   the phrase here, and so is a pathetical expression of his present
   affliction, heightened by the dignity of the public office wherein
   Nehemiah was at the time of writing this mournful psalm, (Nehemiah 1:1
   and 2:1.) The greater his place was at Shushan, the deeper his sorrow
   for his countrymen and for Jerusalem (Nehemiah 1:3) pierced him,
   whereupon he complains that God, by way of indignation, hath dealt with
   him, as those that take an earthen vessel and throw it against the
   pavement, and that they may beat it to pieces the more certainly, lift
   it up first as high as they can, to throw it down with more violence.
   This the LXX. have fitly rendered, eparas kater'rhaxas me, and the
   Latin, elevans illisisti me, having lifted me up, thou hast dashed me
   to pieces.'" -- Hammond

   [146] It is literally, "My days are like a shadow, stretched out." As
   the sun descends in the firmament, the shadow of any terrestrial object
   gradually lengthens, and grows fainter as it becomes longer, until
   shooting out to an unmeasurable length, it disappears. The Psalmist
   complains that his days were like a shadow nearly stretched to its
   utmost length, and at the point of being lost in total darkness. He
   felt that he had far passed his meridian, that the sun of life was
   about to set, and the dark night of death to fall down upon him" -- See
   Psalm 109:23.

   Psalm 102:12-14

   12. And thou, O Jehovah! shalt dwell for ever; and the memorial of thee
   from generation to generation. 13. Thou shalt arise, and have mercy
   upon Zion; for the time to pity her, for the appointed time, is come.
   14. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and will have
   compassion upon her dust.


   12. And thou, O Jehovah! shalt dwell for ever When the prophet, for his
   own encouragement, sets before himself the eternity of God, it seems,
   at first sight, to be a far-fetched consolation; for what benefit will
   accrue to us from the fact that God sits immutable on his heavenly
   throne, when, at the same time, our frail and perishing condition does
   not permit us to continue unmoved for a single moment? And, what is
   more, this knowledge of the blessed repose enjoyed by God enables us
   the better to perceive that our life is a mere illusion. But the
   inspired writer, calling to remembrance the promises by which God had
   declared that he would make the Church the object of his special care,
   and particularly that remarkable article of the covenant, "I will dwell
   in the midst of you," (Exodus 25:8) and, trusting to that sacred and
   indissoluble bond, has no hesitation in representing all the godly
   languishing, though they were in a state of suffering and wretchedness,
   as partakers of this celestial glory in which God dwells. The word
   memorial is also to be viewed in the same light. What advantage would
   we derive from this eternity and immutability of God's being, unless we
   had in our hearts the knowledge of him, which, produced by his gracious
   covenant, begets in us the confidence arising from a mutual
   relationship between him and us? The meaning then is, "We are like
   withered grass, we are decaying every moment, we are not far from
   death, yea rather, we are, as it were, already dwelling in the grave;
   but since thou, O God! hast made a covenant with us, by which thou hast
   promised to protect and defend thine own people, and hast brought
   thyself into a gracious relation to us, giving us the fullest assurance
   that thou wilt always dwell in the midst of us, instead of desponding,
   we must be of good courage; and although we may see only ground for
   despair if we depend upon ourselves, we ought nevertheless to lift up
   our minds to the heavenly throne, from which thou wilt at length
   stretch forth thy hand to help us." Whoever is in a moderate degree
   acquainted with the sacred writings, will readily acknowledge that
   whenever we are besieged with death, in a variety of forms, we should
   reason thus: As God continues unchangeably the same -- "without
   variableness or shadow of turning" -- nothing can hinder him from
   aiding us; and this he will do, because we have his word, by which he
   has laid himself under obligation to us, and because he has deposited
   with us his own memorial, which contains in it a sacred and
   indissoluble bond of fellowship.

   13. Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion. We have here the
   conclusion drawn from the truth stated in the preceding verse -- God is
   eternal, and therefore he will have compassion upon Zion. God's
   eternity is to be considered as impressed upon the memorial, or word,
   by which he has brought himself under obligation to maintain our
   welfare. Besides, as he is not destitute of the power, and as it is
   impossible for him to deny himself, we ought not to entertain any
   apprehension of his failing to accomplish, in his own time, what he has
   promised. We have observed, in another place, that, the verb to arise
   refers to what is made apparent to the eye of sense; for although he
   continues always immutable, yet, in putting forth his power, he
   manifests his majesty by the external act, as it is termed.

   When the prophet treats of the restoration of the Church, he sets forth
   the divine mercy as its cause. He represents this mercy under a twofold
   aspect, and therefore employs different words. In the first place, as
   in the matter under consideration, the good deserts of men are entirely
   out of the question, and as God cannot be led from any cause external
   to himself to build up his Church, the prophet traces the cause of it
   solely to the free goodness of God. In the second place, he
   contemplates this mercy as connected with the Divine promises. Thou
   shalt have mercy upon Zion, for the time appointed, according to thy
   good pleasure, is come Meanwhile, it is to be observed that, in
   magnifying the Divine mercy, his design was to teach true believers
   that their safety depended on it alone. But we must now attend to what
   time is alluded to. The word mvd, moed, signifies all kind of fixed or
   appointed days. There is, then, beyond all doubt, a reference to the
   prophecy of Jeremiah, recorded in Jeremiah 29:10, and repeated in the
   last chapter of the Second Book of Chronicles, at the 21st verse. That
   the faithful might not sink into despondency, through the long
   continuance of their calamities, they needed to be supported by the
   hope that an end to their captivity had been appointed by God, and that
   it would not extend beyond seventy years. Daniel was employed in
   meditating on this very topic, when "he set his face unto the Lord God,
   to seek, by prayer and supplications," the re-establishment of the
   Church, (Daniel 9:2) In like manner, the object now aimed at by the
   prophet was to encourage both himself and others to confidence in
   prayer, putting God in mind of this remarkable prophecy, as an argument
   to induce him to bring to a termination their melancholy captivity. And
   surely if, in our prayers, we do not continually remember the Divine
   promises, we only cast forth our desires into the air like smoke. It
   is, however, to be observed, that although the time of the promised
   deliverance was approaching, or had already arrived, yet the prophet
   does not cease from the exercise of prayer, to which God stirs us up by
   means of his word. And although the time was fixed, yet he calls upon
   God, for the performance of his covenant, in such a manner, as that he
   is still betaking himself to his free goodness alone; for the promises
   by which God brings himself under obligation to us do not, in any
   degree, obscure his grace.

   14. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones To restrict this to
   Cyrus and Darius is altogether unsuitable. It is not at all wonderful
   to find the Jewish doctors hunting, with excessive eagerness, after
   foolish subtilties; but I am surprised that some of our modern
   commentators subscribe to such a poor and cold interpretation. I am
   aware that, in some places, the unbelieving and the wicked are called
   the servants of God, as in Jeremiah 25:9, because God makes use of them
   as instruments for executing his judgments. Nay, I admit that Cyrus is
   called by name God's chosen servant, (Isaiah 44:28) but the Holy Spirit
   would not have bestowed so honorable a title, either on him or Darius,
   without some qualification. Besides, it is probable that this psalm was
   composed before the edict was published, which granted the people
   liberty to return to their native country. It therefore follows, that
   God's people alone are included in the catalogue of his servants,
   because it is their purpose, during the whole of their life, to obey
   his will in all things. The prophet, I have no doubt, speaks in general
   of the whole Church, intimating that this was not the wish entertained
   merely by one man, but was shared by the whole body of the Church. The
   more effectually to induce God to listen to his prayer, he calls upon
   all the godly, who were then in the world, to join with him in the same
   request. It, unquestionably, very much contributes to increase the
   confidence of success, when supplications are made by all the people of
   God together, as if in the person of one man, according to what the
   Apostle Paul declares,

   "Ye also, helping together by prayer for us, that, for the gift
   bestowed upon us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by
   many on our behalf." (2 Corinthians 1:11)

   Farther, when the deformed materials which remained of the ruins of the
   temple and city are emphatically termed the stones of Zion, this is
   designed to intimate, not only that the faithful in time past were
   affected with the outward splendor of the temple, when, besides
   attracting the eyes of men, it had power to ravish with admiration all
   their senses, but also, that although the temple was destroyed, and
   nothing was to be seen where it stood but hideous desolation, yet their
   attachment to it continued unalterable, and they acknowledged the glory
   of God, in its crumbling stones and decayed rubbish. As the temple was
   built by the appointment of God, and as he had promised its
   restoration, it was, doubtless, proper and becoming that the godly
   should not withdraw their affections from its ruins. Meanwhile, as an
   antidote against the discouraging influence of the taunting mockery of
   the heathen, they required to look into the Divine word for something
   else than what presented itself to their bodily eyes. Knowing that the
   very site of the temple was consecrated to God, and that that sacred
   edifice was to be rebuilt on the same spot, they did not cease to
   regard it with reverence, although its stones lay in disorder,
   mutilated and broken, and heaps of useless rubbish were to be seen
   scattered here and there. The sadder the desolation is to which the
   Church has been brought, the less ought our affections to be alienated
   from her. Yea, rather, this compassion which the faithful then
   exercised, [147] ought to draw from us sighs and groans; and would to
   God that the melancholy description in this passage were not so
   applicable to our own time as it is! He, no doubt, has his churches
   erected in some places, where he is purely worshipped; but, if we cast
   our eyes upon the whole world, we behold his word every where trampled
   under foot, and his worship defiled by countless abominations. Such
   being the case, his holy temple is assuredly every where demolished,
   and in a state of wretched desolation; yea, even those small churches
   in which he dwells are torn and scattered. What are these humble
   erections, when compared with that splendid edifice described by
   Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah? But no desolation ought to prevent us
   from loving the very stones and dust of the Church. Let us leave the
   Papists to be proud of their altars, their huge buildings, and their
   other exhibitions of pomp and splendor; for all that heathenish
   magnificence is nothing else but an abomination in the sight of God and
   his angels, whereas the ruins of the true temple are sacred.

   Psalm 102:15-18

   15. And the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, [148] and all the
   kings of the earth thy glory. 16. For Jehovah hath built up Zion, and
   hath appeared in his glory. 17. He hath regarded the prayer of the
   solitary, [149] and hath not despised their prayers. [150] 18. This
   shall be registered for the generation that is to come: and the people
   to be created shall praise him. [151]


   15. And the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah The prophet here
   describes the fruit which would result from the deliverance of the
   ancient tribes; which is, that thereby God's glory would be rendered
   illustrious among nations and kings. He tacitly intimates, that when
   the Church is oppressed, the Divine glory is at the same time debased;
   even as the God of Israel was, no doubt, at the period referred to,
   derided by the ungodly, as if he had been destitute of the power to
   succor his people. It is therefore declared, that if he redeem them, it
   will afford such a remarkable proof of his power as to constrain the
   Gentiles to reverence him whom they contemned.

   The concluding part of the 16th verse, He hath appeared in his glory,
   refers to the manifestation which God made of himself when he brought
   forth his Church from the darkness of death; even as it is said in
   another place concerning her first deliverance, "Judah was his
   sanctuary, and Israel his dominions" (Psalm 114:2) In like manner in
   the present passage, by again gathering to himself his people who were
   dispersed, and by raising his Church, as it were, from death to life,
   he appeared in his glory. It is surely no ordinary consolation to know
   that the love of God towards us is so great, that he will have his
   glory to shine forth in our salvation. It is true, that when the pious
   Jews were in the midst of their afflictions, the working of divine
   power was hidden from them; but they nevertheless always beheld it by
   the eye of faith, and in the mirror of the divine promises.

   17 He hath regarded the prayer of the solitary It is worthy of notice,
   that the deliverance of the chosen tribes is ascribed to the prayers of
   the faithful. God's mercy was indeed the sole cause which led him to
   deliver his Church, according as he had graciously promised this
   blessing to her; but to stir up true believers to greater earnestness
   in prayer, he promises that what he has purposed to do of his own good
   pleasure, he will grant in answer to their requests. Nor is there any
   inconsistency between these two truths, that God preserves the Church
   in the exercise of his free mercy, and that he preserves her in answer
   to the prayers of his people; for as their prayers are connected with
   the free promises, the effect of the former depends entirely upon the
   latter. When it is said, that the prayers of the solitary were heard,
   it is not to be understood of one man only, (for in the clause
   immediately following, the plural number is used;) but all the Jews, so
   long as they remained ejected from their own country, and lived as
   exiles in a strange land, are called solitary, because, although the
   countries of Assyria and Chaldea were remarkably fertile and
   delightful, yet these wretched captives, as I have previously observed,
   wandered there as in a wilderness. And as at that time this solitary
   people obtained favor by sighing, so now when the faithful are
   scattered, and are without their regular assemblies, the Lord will hear
   their groanings in this desolate dispersion, provided they all with one
   consent, and with unfeigned faith, earnestly breathe after the
   restoration of the Church.

   18. This shall be registered for the generation that is to come The
   Psalmist magnifies still more the fruit of the deliverance of his
   people, for the purpose of encouraging himself and others in the hope
   of obtaining the object of their prayers. He intimates, that this will
   be a memorable work of God, the praise of which shall be handed down to
   succeeding ages. Many things are worthy of praise, which are soon
   forgotten; but the prophet distinguishes between the salvation of the
   Church, for which he makes supplication, and common benefits. By the
   word register, he means that the history of this would be worthy of
   having a place in the public records, that the remembrance of it might
   be transmitted to future generations. There is in the words a beautiful
   contrast between the new creation of the people and the present
   destruction; of which interpreters improperly omit to take any notice.
   When the people were expelled from their country, the Church was in a
   manner extinguished. Her very name might seem to be dead, when the Jews
   were mingled among the heathen nations, and no longer constituted a
   distinct and united body. Their return was accordingly as it were a
   second birth. Accordingly, the prophet with propriety expects a new
   creation. Although the Church had perished, he was persuaded that God,
   by his wonderful power, would make her rise again from death to
   renovated life. This is a remarkable passage, showing that the Church
   is not always so preserved, as to continue to outward appearance to
   survive, but that when she seems to be dead, she is suddenly created
   anew, whenever it so pleases God. Let no desolation, therefore, which
   befalls the Church, deprive us of the hope, that as God once created
   the world out of nothing, so it is his proper work to bring forth the
   Church from the darkness of death.

   [149] The original word for the solitary is hrr, ha-arar; and as rr
   signifies the tamarisk or myrtle, some translate, "the afflicted or
   dejected man;" the myrtle being an emblem of a low and depressed state
   of the Church. Accordingly, in the Chaldee, it is "the prayer of the
   desolate," and in the Septuagint, "the prayer of the humble." Houbigant

   from rh, was naked, as Fry: "When he hath turned himself to the prayer

   and lamentation of a believer, in the time of the last Antichristian
   persecution;" and after observing that the 16th and 17th verses are
   rendered by our English Bible in the future, he says, "These futures,

   Psalm 102:19-22

   19. For he hath looked down from the high place of his holiness; [152]
   Jehovah hath looked down from the heavens unto the earth, 20. To hear
   the groaning of the prisoner; to release the sons of death; [153] 21.
   That the name of Jehovah may be declared in Zion, and his praise in
   Jerusalem; 22. When the peoples [or the nations] shall be gathered
   together, and the kingdoms to serve Jehovah.


   19. For he hath looked down from the high place of his holiness Now the
   prophet contemplates the deliverance after which he breathes with
   anxious desire, as if it had been already accomplished. That the
   malignity of men might not attempt to obscure such a signal blessing of
   Heaven, he openly and in express terms claims for God his rightful
   praise; and the people were constrained in many ways to acknowledge
   therein the divine hand. Long before they were dragged into captivity,
   this calamity had been foretold, that when it took place the judgment
   of God might be clearly manifested; and at the same time deliverance
   had been promised them, and the time specified to be after the lapse of
   seventy years. The ingratitude of men therefore could not devise or
   invent any other cause to which to ascribe their return but the mere
   goodness of God. Accordingly, it is said, that God looked down from
   heaven, that the Jews might not attribute to the grace and favor of
   Cyrus the deliverance which evidently proceeded from Heaven. The high
   place of his holiness or sanctuary is here equivalent to heaven. As the
   temple, in some parts of Scripture, (Psalm 26:8 and Psalm 76:2) is
   called "the habitation of God," in respect of men, so, that we may not
   imagine that there is any thing earthly in God, he assigns to himself a
   dwelling-place in heaven, not because he is shut up there, but that we
   may seek him above the world.

   20. To hear the groaning of the prisoner Here the prophet repeats once
   more what he had previously touched upon concerning prayer, in order
   again to stir up the hearts of the godly to engage in that exercise,
   and that after their deliverance they might know it to have been
   granted to their faith, because, depending on the divine promises, they
   had sent up their groanings to heaven. He calls them prisoners; for
   although they were not bound in fetters, their captivity resembled a
   most rigorous imprisonment. Yea, he affirms a little after that they
   were devoted to death, to give them to understand that their life and
   safety would have been altogether hopeless, had they not been delivered
   from death by the extraordinary power of God.

   21 That the name of Jehovah may be declared in Zion Here is celebrated
   a still more ample and richer fruit of this deliverance than has been
   previously mentioned, which is, that the Jews would not only be united
   into one body to give thanks to God, but that, when brought back to
   their own country, they would also gather kings and nations into the
   same unity of faith, and into the same divine worship with themselves.
   At that time it was a thing altogether incredible, not only that the
   praises of God should within a short period resound, as in the days of
   old, in that temple which was burnt and completely overthrown, [154]
   but also that the nations should resort thither from all quarters, and
   be associated together in the service of God with the Jews, who were
   then like a putrefied carcase. The prophet, to inspire the people with
   the hope of returning to their own land, argues that it was impossible
   that the place which God had chosen for himself should be left in
   perpetual desolation; and declares, that so far from this being the
   case there would be new matter for praising God, inasmuch as His name
   would be worshipped by all nations, and the Church would consist not of
   one nation only, but of the whole world. This we know has been
   fulfilled under the administration of Christ, as was announced in
   prophecy by the holy patriarch,

   "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
   his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the
   Gentiles be," (Genesis 49:10.)

   But as the prophets are wont, in celebrating the deliverance from the
   Babylonish captivity, to extend it to the coming of Christ, the
   inspired bard in this place does not lay hold on merely a part of the
   subject, but carries forward the grace of God, even to its
   consummation. And although it was not necessary that all who were
   converted to Christ should go up to Jerusalem, yet following the manner
   of expression usual with the prophets, he has laid down the observance
   of the divine worship which was appointed under the law, as a mark of
   true godliness. Farther, we may learn from this passage, that the name
   of God is never better celebrated than when true religion is
   extensively propagated, and when the Church increases, which on that
   account is called,

   "The planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified," (Isaiah 61:3.)

   Psalm 102:23-28

   23. He hath afflicted my strength in the way; and shortened my days.
   24. I said, O my God! Cut me not off in the midst of my days: for [155]
   thy years are from generation to generation. 25. Thou hast aforetime
   founded the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 26. They
   shall perish, but thou shalt endure: and all of them shall wax old like
   a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
   changed: 27. But thou art the same, [156] and thy years shall not fail.
   [157] 28. The children of thy servants shall dwell, and their seed
   shall be established before thee.


   23. He hath afflicted my strength in the way Some improperly restrict
   this complaint to the time when the Jews were subjected to much
   annoyance after the liberty granted them to return to their own land.
   We are rather to understand the word journey or way in a metaphorical
   sense. As the manifestation of Christ was the goal of the race which
   God's ancient people were running, they justly complain that they are
   afflicted and weakened in the midst of their course. [158] Thus they
   set before God his promise, telling him, that although they had not run
   at random, but had confided in his protection, they were nevertheless
   broken and crushed by his hand in the midst of their journey. They do
   not indeed find fault with him, as if he had disappointed their hope;
   but fully persuaded, that he does not deal deceitfully with those who
   serve him, by this complaint they strengthen themselves in the hope of
   a favorable issue. In the same sense they add, that their days were
   shortened, because they directed their view to the fullness of time,
   which did not arrive till Christ was revealed. [159] It accordingly
   follows, -- (verse 24,) Cut me not off in the midst of my days. They
   compare the intervening period until Christ should appear to the middle
   of life; for, as has been already observed, the Church only attained to
   her perfect age at his coming. This calamity, no doubt, had been
   foretold, but the nature of the covenant which God had entered into
   with his ancient people required that he should take them under his
   protection, and defend them. The captivity, therefore, was as it were a
   violent rupture, on which account the godly prayed with the greater
   confidence, that they might not be prematurely taken away in the midst
   of their journey. By speaking in this manner, they did not fix for
   themselves a certain term of life; but as God, in freely adopting them,
   had given them the commencement of life, with the assurance that he
   would maintain them even to the advent of Christ, they might
   warrantably bring forward and plead this promise. Lord, as if they had
   said, thou hast promised us life, not for a few days, or for a month or
   for a few years, but until thou shouldst renew the whole world, and
   gather together all nations under the dominion of thine Anointed One.

   What then does the prophet mean when he prays, Let us not perish in the
   midst of our course? [160] The reason stated in the clause immediately
   following, Thy years are from generation to generation, seems to be
   quite inapplicable in the present case. Because God is everlasting,
   does it therefore follow that men will be everlasting too? But on Psalm
   90:2, we have [8]shown how we may with propriety bring forward his
   eternity, as a ground of confidence in reference to our salvation; for
   he desires to be known as eternal, not only in his mysterious and
   incomprehensible essence, but also in his word, according to the
   declaration of the Prophet Isaiah,

   "All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of
   the field; but the word of our God shall stand for ever."
   Isaiah 40:6-8

   Now since God links us to himself by means of his word, however great
   the distance of our frail condition from his heavenly glory, our faith
   should nevertheless penetrate to that blessed state from which he looks
   down upon our miseries. Although the comparison between his eternal
   existence and the brief duration of human life is introduced also for
   another purpose, yet when he sees that men pass away as it were in a
   moment, and speedily evanish, it moves him to compassion, as shall
   presently be declared at greater length.

   25 Thou hast aforetime founded the earth Here the sacred writer
   amplifies what he had previously stated, declaring, that compared with
   God the whole world is a form which quickly vanishes away; and yet a
   little after he represents the Church as exempted from this the common
   lot of all sublunary things, because she has for her foundation the
   word of God, while her safety is secured by the same word. Two subjects
   are therefore here brought under our consideration. The first is, that
   since the heavens themselves are in the sight of God almost as
   evanescent as smoke, the frailty of the whole human race is such as may
   well excite his compassion; and the second is, that although there is
   no stability in the heavens and the earth, yet the Church shall
   continue steadfast for ever, because she is upheld by the eternal truth
   of God. By the first of these positions, true believers are taught to
   consider with all humility, when they come into the divine presence,
   how frail and transitory their condition is, that they may bring
   nothing with them but their own emptiness. Such self-abasement is the
   first step to our obtaining favor in the sight of God, even as He also
   affirms that he is moved by the sight of our miseries to be merciful to
   us. The comparison taken from the heavens is a very happy illustration;
   for how long have they continued to exist, when contrasted with the
   brief span of human life, which passes or rather flies away so swiftly?
   How many generations of men have passed away since the creation, while
   the heavens still continue as they were amidst this continual
   fluctuation? Again, so beautiful is their arrangement, and so excellent
   their frame-work, that the whole fabric proclaims itself to be the
   product of God's hands [161] And yet neither the long period during
   which the heavens have existed, nor their fair embellishment, will
   exempt them from perishing. What then shall become of us poor mortals,
   who die when we are as yet scarcely born? for there is no part of our
   life which does not rapidly hasten to death.

   Interpreters, however, do not all explain these words, The heavens
   shall perish, in the same way. Some understand them as expressing
   simply the change they shall undergo, which will be a species of
   destruction; for although they are not to be reduced to nothing, yet
   this change of their nature, as it may be termed, will destroy what is
   mortal and corruptible in them, so that they shall become, in a manner,
   different and new heavens. Others explain the words conditionally, and
   make the supplement, "If it so please God," regarding it as a thing
   absurd to say that the heavens are subject to corruption. But first,
   there is no necessity for introducing these supplementary words, which
   obscure the sense instead of making it plainer. In the next place,
   these expositors improperly attribute an immortal state to the heavens,
   of which Paul declares that they "groan and travail in pain," like the
   earth and the other creatures, until the day of redemption, (Romans
   8:22) because they are subject to corruption; not indeed willingly, or
   in their own nature, but because man, by precipitating himself headlong
   into destruction, has drawn the whole world into a participation of the
   same ruin. Two things are to be here attended to; first, that the
   heavens are actually subject to corruption in consequence of the fall
   of man; and, secondly, that they shall be so renewed as to warrant the
   prophet to say that they shall perish; for this renovation will be so
   complete that they shall not be the same but other heavens. The amount
   is, that to whatever quarter we turn our eyes, we will see everywhere
   nothing but ground for despair till we come to God. What is there in us
   but rottenness and corruption? and what else are we but a mirror of
   death? Again, what are the changes which the whole world undergoes but
   a kind of presage, yea a prelude of destruction? If the whole
   frame-work of the world is hastening to its end, what will become of
   the human race? If all nations are doomed to perish, what stability
   will there be in men individually considered? We ought therefore to
   seek stability no where else but in God.

   28. The children of thy servants shall dwell. By these words the
   prophet intimates that he does not ask the preservation of the Church,
   because it is a part of the human race, but because God has raised it
   above the revolutions of the world. And undoubtedly, when He adopted us
   as his children, his design was to cherish us as it were in his own
   bosom. The inference of the inspired bard is not, therefore,
   far-fetched, when, amidst innumerable storms, each of which might carry
   us away, he hopes that the Church will have a permanent existence. It
   is true, that when through our own fault we become estranged from God,
   we are also as it were cut off from the fountain of life; but no sooner
   are we reconciled to Him than he begins again to pour down his
   blessings upon us. Whence it follows that true believers, as they are
   regenerated by the incorruptible seed, shall continue to live after
   death, because God continues unchangeably the same. By the word dwell,
   is to be understood an abiding and everlasting inheritance.

   When it is said that the seed of God's servants shall be established
   before his face, the meaning is, that it is not after the manner of the
   world, or according to the way in which the heavens and the earth are
   established, that the salvation of true believers is made steadfast,
   but because of the holy union which exists between them and God. By the
   seed and children of the godly, is to be understood not all their
   descendants without exception -- for many who spring from them
   according to the flesh become degenerate -- but those who do not turn
   aside from the faith of their parents. Successive generations are
   expressly pointed out, because the covenant extends even to future
   ages, as we shall again find in the subsequent psalm. If we firmly keep
   the treasure of life intrusted to us, let us not hesitate, although we
   may be environed with innumerable deaths, to cast the anchor of our
   faith in heaven, that the stability of our welfare may rest in God.

   [155] "Car." -- Fr. This supplement is not in the Latin version.

   [156] The original word for the same is hv', hua, literally He, -- "But
   thou art He;" that is, the Eternal; necessarily eternal; and,
   consequently, unchangeable and imperishable. "The Hebrew word appears
   to be one of the divine names, as if it were said, He who hath
   permanent existence, who exists eminently.' Lowth observes, that it is
   often equivalent to the true and eternal God; and that the phrase in
   this place expresses God's eternal and unchangeable nature." -- Mant

   [157] This and the two preceding verses are applied by the Apostle Paul
   to Christ in Hebrews 1:10, 11, 12, in proof of his superiority to
   angels. In this passage then, Christ, it would appear, is the person
   addressed; for if the apostle's inspiration is admitted, the
   correctness of his interpretation of the Old Testament Scriptures
   cannot be doubted. Inappropriate applications of them, it is evident,
   would be inconsistent with his having spoken under the infallible
   guidance of the Spirit of God. And if these verses are applicable to
   the Savior of men, they contain an irrefragable proof of his essential
   divinity. He is called Jehovah throughout the psalm, a name peculiar to
   God only; the creation of all things is said to be performed by him, a
   work peculiar to God only; eternity and immutability are ascribed to
   him, attributes which in the strict and absolute sense belong
   exclusively to God.

   [158] Way or journey is a term often used in Scripture to denote the
   course of a man's life; and here the Psalmist speaks, as other sacred
   writers not unfrequently do, of the whole Jewish nation as if it were
   one man, and of its continuance, which was to be until the coming of
   Christ, as if the life of one man. It was now, so to speak, only in its
   meridian. An attention to this remark will assist the reader in
   understanding Calvin's exposition of the passage.

   [159] Consequently, the ruin and desolation to which they seemed given
   up by the Babylonish captivity, was like the cutting off or shortening
   of their days.

   [160] "Possibly the Psalmist (whom some learned interpreters suppose to
   be Daniel) may have respect to that prophecy, Daniel 9:24, 25, which
   probably was published before this time; for this time was almost
   precisely the midst of the days between the building of the material
   temple by Solomon, and the building of the spiritual temple, or the
   Church, by the Messias; there being about a thousand years distance
   between these two periods, whereof seventy prophetical weeks, or four
   hundred and ninety years, were yet to come. And so he prays that God
   would not root them out of this Babylonish captivity, but would
   graciously restore them to their own land, and preserve them as a
   Church and nation there, until the coming of the Messias." -- Poole's
   Annotations.

   [161] "The phrase is borrowed from the fact, that hands are the
   instruments by which men usually perform any operation; and this is,
   like other human operations and affections, figuratively transferred to
   God." -- Stuart on Hebrews 1:10.

   [133] "This plaintive poem was written by some pious exile towards the
   expiration of the seventy years of captivity during which the people of
   Israel were detained in Babylon. [...] The author of the psalm had most
   probably been carried away captive in early youth. He had survived
   nearly to the end of the term, and now, worn with cares and anxieties,
   he was earnest with God that deliverance might speedily arrive, lest he
   should sink into the grave without revisiting the delightful scenes by
   which his imagination was enraptured, without witnessing the
   fulfillment of the hopes which the prophets of God had excited by the
   predictions which they had delivered relative to the returning
   prosperity of his beloved country." -- Walford. Hammond thinks that the
   psalm was written by Nehemiah, after the return of Ezra with commission
   for rebuilding the temple. See Nehemiah 1:3, etc. Others ascribe it to
   Jeremiah or Daniel.

   PSALM 103

   By this psalm every godly man is taught to give thanks to God for the
   mercies bestowed upon himself in particular, and then for the grace
   which God has vouchsafed to all his chosen ones in common, by making a
   covenant of salvation with them in his law, that he might make them
   partakers of his adoption. But the Psalmist chiefly magnifies the mercy
   by which God sustains and bears with his people; and that not on
   account of any merit or worth of theirs, for they only deserve to be
   visited with severe punishment, but because he compassionates their
   frailty. The psalm is at length concluded with a general ascription of
   praise to God.

   Psalm 103:1-5

   A Psalm of David. [162]

   1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! and all my inward parts, bless his holy
   name. 2. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! and forget not any of his benefits:
   3. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 4.
   Who redeemeth thy life from the grave; who crowneth [163] thee with
   mercy and compassions; 5. Who satisfieth [or filleth] thy mouth with
   good: thy youth shall be renewed as the eagle's. [164]


   1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! The prophet, by stirring up himself to
   gratitude, gives by his own example a lesson to every man of the duty
   incumbent upon him. And doubtless our slothfulness in this matter has
   need of continual incitement. If even the prophet, who was inflamed
   with a more intense and fervent zeal than other men, was not free from
   this malady, of which his earnestness in stimulating himself is a plain
   confession, how much more necessary is it for us, who have abundant
   experience of our own torpor, to apply the same means for our
   quickening? The Holy Spirit, by his mouth, indirectly upbraids us on
   account of our not being more diligent in praising God, and at the same
   time points out the remedy, that every man may descend into himself and
   correct his own sluggishness. Not content with calling upon his soul
   (by which he unquestionably means the seat of the understanding and
   affections) to bless God, the prophet expressly adds his inward parts,
   addressing as it were his own mind and heart, and all the faculties of
   both. When he thus speaks to himself, it is as if, removed from the
   presence of men, he examined himself before God. The repetition renders
   his language still more emphatic, as if he thereby intended to reprove
   his own slothfulness.

   2. And forget not any of his benefits Here, he instructs us that God is
   not deficient on his part in furnishing us with abundant matter for
   praising him. It is our own ingratitude which hinders us from engaging
   in this exercise. In the first place, he teaches us that the reason why
   God deals with such liberality towards us is, that we may be led to
   celebrate his praise; but at the same time he condemns our inconstancy,
   which hurries us away to any other object rather than to God. How is it
   that we are so listless and drowsy in the performance of this the chief
   exercise of true religion, if it is not because our shameful and wicked
   forgetfulness buries in our hearts the innumerable benefits of God,
   which are openly manifest to heaven and earth? Did we only retain the
   remembrance of them, the prophet assures us that we would be
   sufficiently inclined to perform our duty, since the sole prohibition
   which he lays upon us is, not to forget them.

   3. Who forgiveth all thy iniquities He now enumerates the different
   kinds of the divine benefits, in considering which he has told us that
   we are too forgetful and slothful. It is not without cause that he
   begins with God's pardoning mercy, for reconciliation with him is the
   fountain from which all other blessings flow. God's goodness extends
   even to the ungodly; but they are, notwithstanding, so far from having
   the enjoyment of it, that they do not even taste it. The first then of
   all the blessings of which we have the true and substantial enjoyment,
   is that which consists in God's freely pardoning and blotting out our
   sins, and receiving us into his favor. Yea, rather the forgiveness of
   sins, since it is accompanied with our restoration to the favor of God,
   also sanctifies whatever good things he bestows upon us, that they may
   contribute to our welfare. The second clause is; either a repetition of
   the same sentiment, or else it opens up a wider view of it; for the
   consequence of free forgiveness is, that God governs us by his Spirit,
   mortifies the lusts of our flesh, cleanses us from our corruptions, and
   restores us to the healthy condition of a godly and an upright life.
   These who understand the words, who healeth all thy diseases, as
   referring to the diseases of the body, and as implying that God, when
   he has forgiven our sins, also delivers us from bodily maladies, seem
   to put upon them a meaning too restricted. I have no doubt that the
   medicine spoken of has a respect to the blotting out of guilt; and,
   secondly, to the curing us of the corruptions inherent in our nature,
   which is effected by the Spirit of regeneration; and if any one will
   add as a third particular included, that God being once pacified
   towards us, also remits the punishment which we deserve, I will not
   object. Let us learn from this passage that, until the heavenly
   Physician succor us, we nourish within us, not only many diseases, but
   even many deaths.

   4 Who redeemeth thy life from the grave The Psalmist expresses more
   plainly what our condition is previous to God's curing our maladies --
   that we are dead and adjudged to the grave. The consideration that the
   mercy of God delivers us from death and destruction ought, therefore,
   to lead us to prize it the more highly. If the resurrection of the soul
   from the grave is the first step of spiritual life, what room for
   self-gloriation is left to man? The prophet next teaches us that the
   incomparable grace of God shines forth in the very commencement of our
   salvation, as well as in its whole progress; and the more to enhance
   the commendation of this grace, he adds the word compassions in the
   plural number. He asserts that we are surrounded with them; as if he
   had said, Before, behind, on all sides, above and beneath, the grace of
   God presents itself to us in immeasurable abundance; so that there is
   no place devoid of it. The same truth he afterwards amplifies in these
   words, thy mouth is satisfied, by which metaphor he alludes to the free
   indulgence of the palate, to which we surrender ourselves when we have
   a well-furnished table; for those who have scanty fare dare scarcely
   eat till they are half satisfied. [165] Not that he approves of
   gluttony in greedily devouring God's benefits, as men give loose reins
   to intemperance whenever they have great abundance; but he borrowed
   this phraseology from the common custom of men, to teach us that
   whatever good things our hearts can wish flow to us from God's bounty,
   even to perfect satisfaction. Those who take the Hebrew word dy, adi,
   for ornament, [166] mar the passage by a mere conceit of their own; and
   I am surprised how so groundless an imagination should have come into
   their minds, unless it may be accounted for from the circumstance that
   it is usual for men of a prying or inquisitive turn of mind, when they
   would show their ingenuity, to bring forward mere puerilities. The
   Psalmist next adds, that God was constantly infusing into him new
   vigor, so that his strength continued unimpaired, even as the Prophet
   Isaiah, (Isaiah 65:20) in discoursing on the restoration of the Church,
   says that a man of a hundred years old shall be like a child. By this
   mode of expression, he intimates that God, along with a very abundant
   supply of all good things, communicates to him also inward rigor, that
   he may enjoy them; and thus his strength was as it were continually
   renewed. From the comparison of the eagle, the Jews have taken occasion
   to invent, for the purpose of explanation, a fabulous story. Although
   they know not even the first elements of any science, yet so
   presumptuous are they, that whatever may be the matter treated of, they
   never hesitate to attempt to explain it, and whenever they meet with
   any thing which they do not understand, there is no figment so foolish
   that they do not bring forward, as if it were an oracle of God. Thus,
   for expounding the present passage, they give out that eagles, every
   tenth year, ascend to the elemental fire, that their feathers may be
   burnt, [167] and that then they plunge themselves into the sea, and
   immediately new feathers grow upon them. But we may easily gather the
   simple meaning of the Prophet from the nature of the eagle, as
   described by philosophers, and which is well-known from observation.
   That bird continues fresh and vigorous, even to extreme old age,
   unenfeebled by years, and exempt from disease, until it finally dies of
   hunger. That it is long-lived is certain; but at last, its beak or bill
   grows so great that it cannot any longer take food, and, consequently,
   is forced to suck blood, or to nourish itself by drinking. Hence the
   ancient proverb in reference to old men who are addicted to drinking,
   The eagle's old age; for necessity then constrains eagles to drink
   much. But as drink alone is insufficient to maintain life, they die
   rather through hunger, than fail by the natural decay of strength.
   [168] Now we perceive, without the help of any invented story, the
   genuine meaning of the Prophet to be, that as eagles always retain
   their rigor, and even in their old age are still youthful, so the godly
   are sustained by a secret influence derived from God, by which they
   continue in the possession of unimpaired strength. They are not always,
   it is true, full of bodily vigor while in this world, but rather
   painfully drag on their lives in continual weakness; still what is here
   said applies to them in a certain sense. This unquestionably is common
   to all in general, that they have been brought out of the grave, and
   have experienced God to be bountiful to them in innumerable ways. Were
   each of them duly to reflect how much he is indebted to God, he would
   say with good reason that his mouth is filled with good things; just as
   David, in Psalm 40:5, and 139:18, confesses that he was unable to
   reckon up the Divine benefits, because "they are more in number than
   the sands of the sea." Did not our own perverseness blind our
   understandings, we would see that, even in famine, we are furnished
   with food in such a manner, as that God shows us the manifold riches of
   his goodness. With regard to the renovation of our strength, the
   meaning is, that since, when our outward man decays, we are renewed to
   a better life, we have no reason to be troubled at the giving way of
   our strength, especially when he sustains us by his Spirit under the
   weakness and languishing of our mortal frames.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [162] The author of this beautiful and affecting psalm was David; but
   the time and occasion of its composition are uncertain. Some are of
   opinion that it is a song of gratitude for David's recovery from some
   dangerous sickness. Others think it was written upon his receiving
   assurance that his great sin in the case of Bathsheba and Uriah was
   forgiven. "I am not prepared to say," observes Walford, "that this
   judgment is certainly correct; but as it is a subject of no great
   moment, am willing to acquiesce in it. If it be correct, then we have
   two of the most instructive examples of enlightened and fervent piety,
   which are contained in the Holy Scriptures, occasioned by one failure
   in the conduct of a good man, who was habitually remarkable for his
   steadfast obedience to the laws of God. The one of these examples is in
   Psalm 51, in which the sacred writer records his deep and humble
   penitence: and the other, which is now before us, displays the feelings
   of sacred joy and thankfulness, in terms that are most delightful and
   consolatory. So admirably adapted are these two psalms to the varied
   sentiments and emotions of Christian feeling, that I can scarcely
   suppose any real believer of the gospel is to be found who has not, on
   multiplied occasions, made them the objects of his attentive
   meditation, so as to have, if not the express words, yet the sense of
   them, engraven on his heart and memory, in characters never to be
   effaced but by death."

   [163] "Ou, envirrone." -- Fr. marg. "Or, surroundeth."

   [164] Walford's rendering of this verse is as follows: -- "Who
   satisfieth thy advancing age with good;
   Thy youth is renewed as the eagle's." In defense of reading "thy
   advancing age" instead of "thy mouth" as it is in our English
   translation, and as Calvin has it, he observes, "The version here
   adopted is that of the Chaldee, and is supported by the parallelism in
   the following clause."

   [165] "A grand' peine osent-ils manger a demi leur saoul." -- Fr.

   [166] "Abu Walid mentions two interpretations: 1. That of our English
   translators; 2. That which takes dyk in the sense of ornament, who
   multiplieth thy adorning with good,' i e., who abundantly adorneth thee
   with good.' Aben Ezra approves the notion of ornament, but applies it
   to the soul, the ornament of the body, i e., who satisfieth thy soul
   with good.'" -- Hammond The Septuagint reads, epithumian sou, "thy
   desire," or "sensitive appetite," the satisfying of which is the
   providing for the body all the good things it stands in need of, and
   thus it is equivalent to "satisfying," or "filling the mouth," the
   organ for conveying nourishment to the body. Kimchi understands the
   phrase as expressing David's recovery from sickness. In sickness the
   soul abhorreth bread, and even dainty meat, Job 33:20. The physician,
   too, limits the diet of the patient, and prescribes things which are
   nauseous to the palate. This commentator, therefore, supposes that
   David here describes the blessing of health, by his mouth being filled
   with good things

   [167] "Afin que leurs plumes soyent bruslees." -- Fr.

   [168] What Calvin here asserts of the eagle has as little foundation in
   truth as the Jewish fiction which he justly discards. Augustine's
   explanation of the renewal of the youth of the eagle is equally
   fabulous. He affirms that in its old age its beak grows out so long,
   and becomes so incurvated, as to hinder it from taking food, thus
   endangering its life, but that it removes the excrescence, by striking
   its beak against a stone, so that it is enabled to take its ordinary
   food, and becomes young again. "There are," says Dr Adam Clarke, "as
   many legends of the eagle among the ancient writers as there are in the
   Kalendar of some saints, and all equally true. Even among modern
   divines, Bible-Dictionary men, and such like, the most ridiculous tales
   concerning this bird continue to be propagated; and no small portion of
   them have been crowded into comments on this very verse." Of these
   "legends of the eagle," the accounts given of it by the Jewish
   commentators, by Calvin himself, and by Augustine, are a specimen; for
   they are altogether unsupported from its natural history. The Psalmist,
   in speaking of the renewing of its youth, we conceive refers simply to
   the changing of its feathers. Like all other birds, the eagle has its
   annual moulting season, in which it casts its old feathers, and is
   furnished with a new stock. When its plumage is thus renewed, its
   appearance becomes more youthful and beautiful, while, at the same
   time, its rigour and liveliness are improved. In like manner, by the
   communications of Divine grace, the spiritual beauty, strength, and
   activity of the people of God are increased. Although any other bird
   would have served the Psalmist's purpose, yet he may have preferred the
   eagle, not only because it is the king of birds, superior to others of
   the feathered tribe in size, strength, and vivacity, but because it
   retains its vigor to a protracted old age, and preserves its youthful
   appearance to the last by the frequent change of its plumage. The
   Prophet Isaiah uses the same allusion, to illustrate the perseverance
   of the saints in holiness, "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew
   their strength;
   they shall mount up with wings as eagles."
   Isaiah 40:31 The eagle seems to have borrowed its Hebrew name nsr,
   nesher, from the shedding of its plumage. Its root is the Chaldee verb
   nsr, nashar, decidit, defluxit, he fell, he shed "The name agrees with
   svr, to look at," says Bythner, "because the eagle can look at the sun
   with a straight and steady gaze; also with ysr, to be straight, because
   it flies in a straight course."

   Psalm 103:6-8

   6. Jehovah executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
   oppressed. 7. He made known his ways to Moses, his doings to the
   children of Israel. 8. Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger,
   and abundant in goodness.


   6. Jehovah executeth righteousness David having recounted the Divine
   benefits bestowed upon himself, now passes from this personal
   consideration to take a wider view of the subject. There is, however,
   no doubt that when he declares God to be the succorer of the oppressed,
   he includes himself among the number, for he had enjoyed the Divine
   help under many persecutions; and, from his own experience, he
   describes the character in which God is accustomed to manifest himself
   towards all who are unrighteously afflicted. As the faithful, while in
   this world, are always living among wolves, by using the plural number,
   he celebrates a variety of deliverances, to teach us that it is God's
   ordinary work to succor his servants whenever he sees them injuriously
   treated. Hence we are taught to exercise patience when we find that God
   takes it upon him to avenge our wrongs, and that he covers us with the
   shield of his justice, or defends us with the sword of his judgment, as
   often as we are assaulted wrongfully.

   7 He hath made known his ways to Moses David now speaks in the name of
   the chosen people; and this he does very suitably, being led to it by
   the consideration of the benefits which God had bestowed upon himself.
   Convinced that it was only as a member of the Church that he had been
   enriched with so many blessings, he immediately carries back his
   contemplations to the common covenant made with the people of Israel.
   He, however, continues the same train of thought as in the preceding
   verse; for these ways, which he says had been shown to Moses, were
   nothing else than the deliverance wrought for the people until they
   entered the promised land. He selected this as an instance of God's
   righteousness and judgment, surpassing all others, to prove that God
   always shows himself righteous in succoring those who are oppressed.
   But since this instance depended upon the Divine promise, he doubtless
   has an eye principally to it; his language implying that God's
   righteousness was clearly demonstrated and seen in the history of the
   chosen people, whom he had adopted, and with whom he had entered into
   covenant. God is said to have made known his ways first to Moses, who
   was his servant and messenger, and afterwards to all the people. Moses
   is here represented as invested with the office to which he was
   Divinely appointed; for it was God's will to be made known to the
   people by the hand and working of that distinguished man. The ways,
   then, and the doings of God, are his rising up with wonderful power to
   deliver the people, his leading them through the Red Sea, and his
   manifesting his presence with them by many signs and miracles. But as
   all this flowed from the free covenant, David exhorts himself and
   others to give thanks to God for having chosen them to be his peculiar
   people, and for enlightening their minds by the truths of his law. Man,
   without the knowledge of God, being the most miserable object that can
   be imagined, the discovery which God has been pleased to make to us in
   his Word, of his fatherly love, is an incomparable treasure of perfect
   happiness.

   8. Jehovah is merciful and gracious David seems to allude to the
   exclamation of Moses, recorded in Exodus 34:6, where the nature of God,
   revealed in a remarkable way, is more clearly described than in other
   places. When Moses was admitted to take a nearer view of the Divine
   glory than was usually obtained, he exclaimed upon beholding it, "O
   God! merciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity, slow to wrath, and
   abundant in goodness." As, therefore, he has summarily comprehended in
   that passage all that is important for us to know concerning the Divine
   character, David happily applies these terms, by which God is there
   described, to his present purpose. His design is to ascribe entirely to
   the goodness of God the fact that the Israelites, who by their own
   wickedness forfeited from time to time their relation to him, as his
   adopted people, nevertheless continued in that relation. Farther, we
   must understand in general, that the true knowledge of God corresponds
   to what faith discovers in the written Word; for it is not his will
   that we should search into his secret essence, except in so far as he
   makes himself known to us, a point worthy of our special notice. We see
   that whenever God is mentioned, the minds of men are perversely carried
   away to cold speculations, and fix their attention on things which can
   profit them nothing; while, in the meantime, they neglect those
   manifestations of his perfections which meet our eyes, and which afford
   a vivid reflection of his character. To whatever subjects men apply
   their minds, there is none from which they will derive greater
   advantage than from continual meditation on his wisdom, goodness,
   righteousness, and mercy; and especially the knowledge of his goodness
   is fitted both to build up our faith, and to illustrate his praises.
   Accordingly, Paul, in Ephesians 3:18, declares that our height, length,
   breadth, and depth, consists in knowing the unspeakable riches of
   grace, which have been manifested to us in Christ. This also is the
   reason why David, copying from Moses, magnifies by a variety of terms
   the mercy of God. In the first place, as we have no worse fault than
   that devilish arrogance which robs God of his due praise, and which yet
   is so deeply rooted in us, that it cannot be easily eradicated; God
   rises up, and that he may bring to nought the heaven-daring presumption
   of the flesh, asserts in lofty terms his own mercy, by which alone we
   stand. Again, when we ought to rely upon the grace of God, our minds
   tremble or waver, and there is nothing in which we find greater
   difficulty than to acknowledge that He is merciful to us. David, to
   meet and overcome this doubting state of mind, after the example of
   Moses, employs these synonymous terms: first, that God is merciful;
   secondly, that he is gracious; thirdly, that he patiently and
   compassionately bears with the sins of men; and, lastly, that he is
   abundant in mercy and goodness.

   Psalm 103:9-12

   9. He will not always chide: nor will he keep his anger for ever. 10.
   He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to
   our iniquities. 11. For in proportion to the height of the heavens
   above the earth has been the greatness of his goodness [169] upon [170]
   them that fear him. 12. As far as the east is from the west, so far
   hath he removed our transgressions from us.


   9 He will not always chide David, from the attributes ascribed to God
   in the preceding verse, draws the conclusion, that when God has been
   offended, he will not be irreconcilable, since, from his nature, he is
   always inclined to forgive. It was necessary to add this statement; for
   our sins would be continually shutting the gate against his goodness
   were there not some way of appeasing his anger. David tacitly intimates
   that God institutes an action against sinners to lay them low under a
   true sense of their guilt; and that yet he recedes from it whenever he
   sees them subdued and humbled. God speaks in a different manner in
   Genesis 6:3, where he says, "My Spirit shall no longer strive with
   man," because the wickedness of men being fully proved, it was then
   time to condemn them. But here David maintains that God will not always
   chide, because so easy is he to be reconciled, and so ready to pardon,
   that he does not rigidly exact from us what strict justice might
   demand. To the same purpose is the language in the second clause: nor
   will he keep anger for ever The expression, to keep anger for ever,
   corresponds with the French phrase, Je lui garde, Il me l'a garde,
   [171] which we use when the man, who cannot forgive the injuries he has
   received, cherishes secret revenge in his heart, and waits for an
   opportunity of retaliation. Now David denies that God, after the manner
   of men, keeps anger on account of the injuries done to him, since he
   condescends to be reconciled. It is, however, to be understood that
   this statement does not represent the state of the Divine mind towards
   all mankind without distinction: it sets forth a special privilege of
   the Church; for God is expressly called by Moses, (Deuteronomy 5:9) "a
   terrible avenger, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
   children." But David, passing by unbelievers, upon whom rests the
   everlasting and unappeasable wrath of God, teaches us how tenderly he
   pardons his own children, even as God himself speaks in Isaiah, (Isaiah
   54:7, 8,) "For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great
   mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from them
   for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee."

   10. He hath not dealt with us after our sins The Psalmist here proves
   from experience, or from the effect, what he has stated concerning the
   Divine character; for it was entirely owing to the wonderful
   forbearance of God that the Israelites had hitherto continued to exist.
   Let each of us, as if he had said, examine his own life; let us inquire
   in how many ways we have provoked the wrath of God? or, rather, do we
   not continually provoke it? and yet he not only forbears to punish us,
   but bountifully maintains those whom he might justly destroy.

   11. For in proportion to the height of the heavens above the earth The
   Psalmist here confirms by a comparison the truth that God does not
   punish the faithful as they have deserved, but, by his mercy, strives
   against their sins. The form of expression is equivalent to saying that
   God's mercy towards us is infinite. With respect to the word gvr,
   gabar, it is of little consequence whether it is taken in a neuter
   signification, or in a transitive, as is noted on the margin; for in
   either way the immeasurableness of God's mercy is compared to the vast
   extent of the world. As the mercy of God could not reach us, unless the
   obstacle of our guilt were taken away, it is immediately added, (verse
   12th,) that God removes our sins as far from us as the east is distant
   from the west The amount is, that God's mercy is poured out upon the
   faithful far and wide, according to the magnitude of the world; and
   that, in order to take away every impediment to its course, their sins
   are completely blotted out. The Psalmist confirms what I have just now
   stated, namely, that he does not treat in general of what God is
   towards the whole world, but of the character in which he manifests
   himself towards the faithful. Whence also it is evident that he does
   not here speak of that mercy by which God reconciles us to himself at
   the first, but of that with which he continually follows those whom he
   has embraced with his fatherly love. There is one kind of mercy by
   which he restores us from death to life, while as yet we are strangers
   to him, and another by which he sustains this restored life; for that
   blessing would forthwith be lost did he not confirm it in us by daily
   pardoning our sins. Whence also we gather how egregiously the Papists
   trifle in imagining that the free remission of sins is bestowed only
   once, and that afterwards righteousness is acquired or retained by the
   merit of good works, and that whatever guilt we contract is removed by
   satisfactions. Here David does not limit to a moment of time the mercy
   by which God reconciles us to himself in not imputing to us our sins,
   but extends it even to the close of life. Not less powerful is the
   argument which this passage furnishes us in refutation of those
   fanatics who bewitch both themselves and others with a vain opinion of
   their having attained to perfect righteousness, so that they no longer
   stand in need of pardon.

   [169] "Ou, il a magnifie sa bonte." -- Fr. marg. "Or, he hath magnified
   his goodness."

   [170] "Hammond prefers reading above "Though l," says he, "signifies on
   and towards, as well as above or over, and may be fitly so rendered,
   verses 13 and 17, where (as here) God's mercy is said to be l, upon his
   children, and l, upon them that fear him; yet the comparison that is
   here made between the heaven and the earth, and the height or

   God be, his mercy towards us is as far above the size or proportion of
   that, as the heaven is above the earth, i e., there is no proportion
   between them; the one is as a point to that other vast circumference;
   nay, the difference far greater, as God's mercy is infinite, like
   himself, and so infinitely exceeding the pitiful imperfect degree of
   our obedience. The other expression that follows verse 12, taken from
   the distance of the East from the West, is pitched upon, says Kimchi,
   because those two quarters of the world are of greatest extent, being
   all known and inhabited. From whence it is that geographers reckon that
   way their longitudes, as from North to South their latitudes."

   [171] "I am watching him, as he has watched to do a bad turn to me."

   Psalm 103:13-16

   13. As a father is compassionate towards his children, so has Jehovah
   been compassionate [172] towards them that fear him. 14. For he knoweth
   of what we are made; he hath remembered that we are dust. 15. As for
   man, his days are like the grass: as a flower of the field, so he
   flourisheth. 16. As soon as the wind passeth over it, it is gone; [173]
   and its place shall know it no more.


   13. As a father is compassionate towards his children, The Psalmist not
   only explains by a comparison what he has already stated, but he at the
   same time assigns the cause why God so graciously forgives us, which
   is, because he is a father It is then in consequence of God's having
   freely and sovereignly adopted us as his children that he continually
   pardons our sins, and accordingly we are to draw from that fountain the
   hope of forgiveness. And as no man has been adopted on the ground of
   his own merit, it follows that sins are freely pardoned. God is
   compared to earthly fathers, not because he is in every respect like
   them, but because there is no earthly image by which his unparalleled
   love towards us can be better expressed. That God's fatherly goodness
   may not be perverted as an encouragement to sin, David again repeats
   that God is thus favorable only to those who are his sincere
   worshippers. It is indeed a proof of no ordinary forbearance for God to
   "make his sun to rise on the evil and on the good," (Matthew 5:45;) but
   the subject here treated is the free imputation of the righteousness by
   which we are accounted the children of God. Now this righteousness is
   offered only to those who entirely devote themselves to so bountiful a
   Father, and reverently submit to his word. But as our attainments in
   godliness in this world, whatever they may be, come far short of
   perfection, there remains only one pillar on which our salvation can
   securely rest, and that is the goodness of God.

   14. For he knoweth David here annihilates all the worth which men would
   arrogate to themselves, and asserts that it is the consideration of our
   misery, and that alone, which moves God to exercise patience towards
   us. This again we ought carefully to mark, not only for the purpose of
   subduing the pride of our flesh, but also that a sense of our
   unworthiness may not prevent us from trusting in God. The more wretched
   and despicable our condition is, the more inclined is God to show
   mercy, for the remembrance that we are clay and dust is enough to
   incite him to do us good.

   To the same purpose is the comparison immediately following, (verse
   15,) that all the excellency of man withers away like a fading flower
   at the first blast of the wind. Man is indeed improperly said to
   flourish. But as it might be alleged that he is, nevertheless,
   distinguished by some endowment or other, David grants that he
   flourishes like the grass, instead of saying, as he might justly have
   done, that he is a vapor or shadow, or a thing of nought. Although, as
   long as we live in this world, we are adorned with natural gifts, and,
   to say nothing of other things, "live, and move, and have our being in
   God," (Acts 17:28;) yet as we have nothing except what is dependent on
   the will of another, and which may be taken from us every hour, our
   life is only a show or phantom that passes away. The subject here
   treated, is properly the brevity of life, to which God has a regard in
   so mercifully pardoning us, as it is said in another psalm: "He
   remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and
   cometh not again," (Psalm 78:39.) If it is asked why David, making no
   mention of the soul, which yet is the principal part of man, declares
   us to be dust and clay? I answer, that it is enough to induce God
   mercifully to sustain us, when he sees that nothing surpasses our life
   in frailty. And although the soul, after it has departed from the
   prison of the body, remains alive, yet its doing so does not arise from
   any inherent power of its own. Were God to withdraw his grace, the soul
   would be nothing more than a puff or blast, even as the body is dust;
   and thus there would doubtless be found in the whole man nothing but
   mere vanity.

   [173] It has been supposed that there is here a reference to that
   pestilential destructive wind of the East, called the Simoon, which,
   from its extreme heat, destroys at once every green thing. Disease and

   speedily as this scorching wind blasts the tender flower.

   Psalm 103:17-18

   17. But the goodness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon
   them that fear him, and his righteousness upon the children's children;
   18. To those who keep his covenant, and remember his statutes to do
   them


   17. But the goodness of Jehovah, etc The Psalmist leaves nothing to men
   to rely upon but the mercy of God; for it would be egregious folly to
   seek a ground of confidence in themselves. After having shown the utter
   emptiness of men, he adds the seasonable consolation, that, although
   they have no intrinsic excellence, which does not vanish into smoke,
   yet God is an inexhaustible fountain of life, to supply their wants.
   This contrast is to be particularly observed; for whom does he thus
   divest of all excellence? The faithful who are regenerated by the
   Spirit of God, and who worship him with true devotion, these are the
   persons whom he leaves nothing on which their hope may rest but the
   mere goodness of God. As the Divine goodness is everlasting, the
   weakness and frailty of the faithful does not prevent them from
   boasting of eternal salvation to the close of life, and even in death
   itself. David does not confine their hope within the limits of time --
   he views it as commensurate in duration with the grace on which it is
   founded. To goodness is subjoined righteousness, a word, as we have had
   occasion frequently to observe before, denoting the protection by which
   God defends and preserves his own people. He is then called righteous,
   not because he rewards every man according to his desert, but because
   he deals faithfully with his saints, in spreading the hand of his
   protection over them. The Prophet has properly placed this
   righteousness after goodness, as being the effect of goodness. He also
   asserts that it extends to the children and children's children,
   according to these words in Deuteronomy 7:9, "God keepeth mercy to a
   thousand generations." It is a singular proof of his love that he not
   only receives each of us individually into his favor, but also herein
   associates with us our offspring, as it were by hereditary right, that
   they may be partakers of the same adoption. How shall He cast us off,
   who, in receiving our children and children's children into his
   protection, shows to us in their persons how precious our salvation is
   in his sight?

   Farther, as nothing is more easy than for hypocrites to flatter
   themselves under a false pretext, that they are in favor with God, or
   for degenerate children groundlessly to apply to themselves the
   promises made to their fathers, it is again stated, by way of
   exception, in the 18th verse, that God is merciful only to those who,
   on their part, keep his covenant, which the unbelieving make of none
   effect by their wickedness. The keeping, or observing of the covenant,
   which is here put instead of the fear of God, mentioned in the
   preceding verse, is worthy of notice; for thus David intimates that
   none are the true worshippers of God but those who reverently obey his
   Word. Very far from this are the Papists, who, thinking themselves
   equal to the angels in holiness, nevertheless shake off the yoke of
   God, like wild beasts, by trampling under foot his Holy Word. David,
   therefore, rightly judges of men's godliness, by their submitting
   themselves to the Word of God, and following the rule which he has
   prescribed to them. As the covenant begins with a solemn article
   containing the promise of grace, faith and prayer are required, above
   all things, to the proper keeping of it. Nor is the additional clause
   superfluous -- who remember his statutes; for, although God is
   continually putting us in mind of them, yet we soon slide away to
   worldly cares -- are confused by a multiplicity of avocations, and are
   lulled asleep by many allurements. Thus forgetfulness extinguishes the
   light of truth, unless the faithful stir up themselves from time to
   time. David tells us that this remembrance of God's statutes has an
   invigorating effect when men employ themselves in doing them. Many are
   sufficiently forward to discourse upon them with their tongues whose
   feet are very slow, and whose hands are well nigh dead, in regard to
   active service.

   Psalm 103:19-22

   19. Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom
   ruleth over all. 20. Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, who are mighty in
   strength, who do his commandment, in hearing [174] the voice of his
   word. 21. Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts; ye his ministers, who do his
   pleasure. 22. Bless Jehovah, all ye his works in all places of his
   dominion: bless Jehovah, O my soul!


   19. Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens David having
   recounted the benefits by which God lays each of us in particular, and
   also the whole Church, under obligation to him, now extols in general
   his infinite glory. The amount is, that whenever God is mentioned, men
   should learn to ascend in their contemplations above the whole world,
   because his majesty transcends the heavens; and they should farther
   learn not to measure his power by that of man, since it has under its
   control all kingdoms and dominions. That none may think that earthly
   creatures only are here put in subjection to God, the Psalmist chiefly
   addresses the angels. In calling upon them to join in praising God, he
   teaches both himself and all the godly, that there is not a better nor
   a more desirable exercise than to praise God, since there is not a more
   excellent service in which even the angels are employed. The angels are
   doubtless too willing and prompt in the discharge of this duty, to
   stand in need of incitement from us. With what face then, it may be
   said, can we, whose slothfulness is so great, take it upon us to exhort
   them? But although these exalted beings run swiftly before us, and we
   with difficulty come lagging after them, yet David enjoins them to sing
   God's praises for our sake, that by their example he may awaken us from
   our drowsiness. The object he has in view, as I have adverted to
   before, is to be noted, which is, by addressing his discourse to the
   angels to teach us, that the highest end which they propose to
   themselves is to advance the divine glory. Accordingly, while in one
   sentence he clothes them with strength, in the immediately following,
   he describes them as hanging on God's word, waiting for his orders, --
   Ye who do his commandment However great the power, as if he had said,
   with which you are endued, you reckon nothing more honorable than to
   obey God. And it is not only said that they execute God's commandments,
   but to express more distinctly the promptitude of their obedience, it
   is asserted, that they are always ready to perform whatever he commands
   them.

   21 Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts. By hosts is not to be understood
   the stars, as some explain it. The subject of the preceding verse is
   still continued. Nor is the repetition superfluous; for the word hosts
   teaches us that there are myriads of myriads who stand before the
   throne of God, ready to receive every intimation of his will. Again,
   they are called his ministers who do his pleasure, to intimate to us,
   that they are not there intent in idly beholding God's glory, but that
   having been appointed as our ministers and guardians, they are always
   ready for their work. Instead of word, the term pleasure is here used,
   and both are employed with much propriety; for although the sun, the
   moon, and the stars, observe the laws which God has ordained for them,
   yet being without understanding, they cannot properly be said to obey
   his word and his voice. The term obey is indeed sometimes transferred
   to the mute and insensible parts of creation. [175] It is, however,
   only in a metaphorical sense that they can be said to hearken to God's
   voice, when by a secret instinct of nature they fulfill his purposes.
   But this in the proper sense is true of angels, who actively obey him
   upon their understanding from his sacred mouth what he would have them
   to do. The word pleasure expresses more plainly a joyful and cheerful
   obedience, implying that the angels not only obey God's commandments,
   but also willingly and with the greatest delight receive the
   intimations of his will, that they may perform what he would have them
   to do. Such is the import of the Hebrew noun, as has been stated
   elsewhere.

   22 Bless Jehovah, all ye his works The Psalmist in conclusion addresses
   all creatures; for although they may be without speech and
   understanding, yet they ought in a manner to re-echo the praises of
   their Creator. This he does on our account, that we may learn that
   there is not a corner in heaven or on earth where God is not praised.
   We have less excuse, if, when all the works of God by praising their
   Maker reproach us for our sloth we do not at least follow their
   example. The express mention of all places of his dominion, seems to be
   intended to stir up the faithful to greater ardor in this exercise; for
   if even those countries where his voice is unheard ought not to be mute
   in his praise, how can we lawfully remain silent to whom he opens his
   mouth, anticipating us by his own sacred voice? In short, David shows
   that his design in recounting God's benefits, and magnifying the extent
   of his empire, was to animate himself the more to the exercise of
   praising him.

   [174] In the French version it is "en obeissant," "in obeying." Hammond
   reads, "at hearing;" and observes," The sense of lsm in this place
   seems best expressed by the Arabic, as soon as they hear; for that is
   the character of the angels' obedience, that as soon as they hear the
   voice of God's word, as soon as his will is revealed to them, they
   promptly and presently obey it. The Chaldee renders it, at his voice
   being heard;' and the LXX. Tou akousai, as they hear,' or as soon as
   they hear.'"

   PSALM 104

   This psalm differs from the preceding, inasmuch as it neither treats of
   the special benefits which God bestows upon his Church, nor lifts us up
   to the hope of the heavenly life, but by presenting to us a lively
   image of his wisdom, power, and goodness in the creation of the world,
   and in the order of nature, encourages us to praise him for the
   manifestation he has made of himself as a father to us in this frail
   and perishable life. [176]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 104:1-4

   1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! O Jehovah my God! thou art exceeding
   great; thou hast clothed thyself with praise and glory. 2. Being
   arrayed [177] with light as with a garment; and spreading out the
   heavens as a curtain: 3. Laying the beams of his upper rooms [178] in
   the waters; making the clouds his chariot; and walking upon the wings
   of the wind; 4. Making the winds his messengers; and his ministers a
   flaming fire.


   1 Bless Jehovah, O my soul! After having exhorted himself to praise
   God, the Psalmist adds, that there is abundant matter for such an
   exercise; thus indirectly condemning himself and others of ingratitude,
   if the praises of God, than which nothing ought to be better known, or
   more celebrated, are buried by silence. In comparing the light with
   which he represents God as arrayed to a garment, he intimates, that
   although God is invisible, yet his glory is conspicuous enough. In
   respect of his essence, God undoubtedly dwells in light that is
   inaccessible; but as he irradiates the whole world by his splendor,
   this is the garment in which He, who is hidden in himself, appears in a
   manner visible to us. The knowledge of this truth is of the greatest
   importance. If men attempt to reach the infinite height to which God is
   exalted, although they fly above the clouds, they must fail in the
   midst of their course. Those who seek to see him in his naked majesty
   are certainly very foolish. That we may enjoy the light of him, he must
   come forth to view with his clothing; that is to say, we must cast our
   eyes upon the very beautiful fabric of the world in which he wishes to
   be seen by us, and not be too curious and rash in searching into his
   secret essence. Now, since God presents himself to us clothed with
   light, those who are seeking pretexts for their living without the
   knowledge of him, cannot allege in excuse of their slothfulness, that
   he is hidden in profound darkness. When it is said that the heavens are
   a curtain, it is not meant that under them God hides himself, but that
   by them his majesty and glory are displayed; being, as it were, his
   royal pavilion.

   3. Laying the beams of his chambers in the waters David now proceeds to
   explain at greater length what he had briefly stated under the figure
   of God's raiment. The scope of the passage is shortly this, that we
   need not pierce our way above the clouds for the purpose of finding
   God, since he meets us in the fabric of the world, and is everywhere
   exhibiting to our view scenes of the most vivid description. That we
   may not imagine that there is any thing in Him derived, as if, by the
   creation of the world, he received any addition to his essential
   perfection and glory, we must remember that he clothes himself with
   this robe for our sake. The metaphorical representation of God, as
   laying the beams of his chambers in the waters, seems somewhat
   difficult to understand; but it was the design of the prophet, from a
   thing incomprehensible to us, to ravish us with the greater admiration.
   Unless beams be substantial and strong, they will not be able to
   sustain even the weight of an ordinary house. When, therefore, God
   makes the waters the foundation of his heavenly palace, who can fail to
   be astonished at a miracle so wonderful? When we take into account our
   slowness of apprehension, such hyperbolical expressions are by no means
   superfluous; for it is with difficulty that they awaken and enable us
   to attain even a slight knowledge of God.

   What is meant by his walking upon the wings of the wind, is rendered
   more obvious from the following verse, where it is said, that the winds
   are his messengers God rides on the clouds, and is carried upon the
   wings of the wind, inasmuch as he drives about the winds and clouds at
   his pleasure, and by sending them hither and thither as swiftly as he
   pleases, shows thereby the signs of his presence. By these words we are
   taught that the winds do not blow by chance, nor the lightnings flash
   by a fortuitous impulse, but that God, in the exercise of his sovereign
   power, rules and controls all the agitations and disturbances of the
   atmosphere. From this doctrine a twofold advantage may be reaped. In
   the first place, if at any time noxious winds arise, if the south wind
   corrupt the air, or if the north wind scorch the corn, and not only
   tear up trees by the root, but overthrow houses, and if other winds
   destroy the fruits of the earth, we ought to tremble under these
   scourges of Providence. In the second place, if, on the other hand, God
   moderate the excessive heat by a gentle cooling breeze, if he purify
   the polluted atmosphere by the north wind, or if he moisten the parched
   ground by south winds; in this we ought to contemplate his goodness.

   As the apostle, who writes to the Hebrews, (Hebrews 1:7) quotes this
   passage, and applies it to the angels, both the Greek and Latin
   expositors have almost unanimously considered David as here speaking
   allegorically. In like manner, because Paul, in quoting Psalm 19:4, in
   his Epistle to the Romans, (Romans 10:18) seems to apply to the
   apostles what is there stated concerning the heavens, the whole psalm
   has been injudiciously expounded as if it were an allegory. [179] The
   design of the apostle, in that part of the Epistle to the Hebrews
   referred to, was not simply to explain the mind of the prophet in this
   place; but since God is exhibited to us, as it were, visibly in a
   mirror, the apostle very properly lays down the analogy between the
   obedience which the winds manifestly and perceptibly yield to God, and
   that obedience which he receives from the angels. In short, the meaning
   is, that as God makes use of the winds as his messengers, turns them
   hither and thither, calms and raises them whenever he pleases, that by
   their ministry he may declare his power, so the angels were created to
   execute his commands. And certainly we profit little in the
   contemplation of universal nature, if we do not behold with the eyes of
   faith that spiritual glory of which an image is presented to us in the
   world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [177] "It is a singular circumstance," says Horsley, "in the
   composition of this psalm, that each of the parts of the First
   Semichorus after the first, [that is, verses 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14,
   19,] begins with a participle. And these participles are accusatives,
   agreeing with yhvh, the object of the verb vrky, at the beginning of
   the whole psalm. Bless Jehovah -- putting on -- extending -- laying --
   constituting -- travelling -- making -- setting -- sending -- watering
   -- making -- making. Thus, this transitive verb, in the opening of the
   psalm, extending its government through the successive parts of the
   same semichorus, except the last, unites them all in one long period.
   As this singular artifice of composition seems to be the characteristic
   of a particular species of ode, in this psalm, I have scrupulously
   conformed to it in my translation, at the expense of the elegance of my
   English style." Calvin, for the most part, translates these words as
   participles, but in the nominative case.

   [178] "The original word, which comes from lh, ascendit, signifies any
   upper room to which persons ascend. So 2 Samuel 18:32, he went up to
   lyt hsr, the chamber over the gate.' Accordingly, the LXX. Here render
   it, huperoon, an upper room', and the Latin, superiora ejus', his upper
   stories.' By lyvtyv, therefore, must be meant, though not the supreme,
   yet the superior or middle region of the air, which is here described
   as an upper story in a house laid firm with beams, (accounting the
   earth and the region of air about that as the lower room,) and this
   floor is here said poetically to be laid in the waters,' those waters
   which (Genesis 1) are above the expansion or lower region of the air,
   which divides the waters from the waters. This is most evident by verse
   13, where God is said to water the mountains mlyvtyv, from these his
   upper rooms, these clouds whence the rain descends.' In them, saith the
   Psalmist, the beams of these upper rooms were laid,' i.e., whereas in
   the building of an upper story, there must be some walls or pillars to
   support the weight of it, and in that the beams are laid, God here by
   his own miraculous immediate power laid, and ever since supported these
   upper rooms, there being nothing there but waters to support them, and
   those we know the most fluid tottering body, not able to support
   itself; and therefore that is another work of his divine power, that
   the waters which are so fluid, and unable to contain themselves within
   their own bounds, should yet hang in the middle of the air, and be as
   walls or pillars to support that region of air, which is itself another
   fluid body " -- Hammond. Fry, after quoting Dr Geddes' version, --
   "Flooring his chambers with waters," and Bishop Horsley's "Laying the
   floors of his chambers upon the waters," goes on to say: -- "After
   referring, however, to the different places where the word occurs, and
   considering the structure of ancient buildings, I conceive the allusion
   to be to the roof, or contignated frame of the house. Genesis 19:8,
   seems decisive. We seem to lose somewhat of the beauty of the original
   by translating lyvt too literally. It signifies certainly, upper rooms,
   or stories; but the allusion is not to these on account of their
   situation, but as the part of the house principally inhabited by its
   owner, the lower parts of eastern houses being used for offices. -- See
   Parkhurst and authors there quoted: compare Psalm 18, He set darkness
   his veil around him, -- his canopy the waters and thick mists of the
   clouds.'" Fry's translation is, "And framing his habitation with
   waters."

   Psalm 104:5-9

   5. He hath founded the earth upon its foundations, so that it shall not
   be moved for ever. 6. He hath covered it with the deep as with a
   garment: the waters shall stand above the mountains. 7. At thy rebuke
   they shall flee; at the voice of thy thunder they shall haste away.
   [180] 8. The mountains shall ascend, and the valleys shall descend
   [181] to the place which thou hast founded for them. 9. Thou hast fixed
   a bound over which they shall not pass; they shall not return to cover
   the earth.


   5 He hath founded the earth upon its foundations Here the prophet
   celebrates the glory of God, as manifested in the stability of the
   earth. Since it is suspended in the midst of the air, and is supported
   only by pillars of water, how does it keep its place so steadfastly
   that it cannot be moved? This I indeed grant may be explained on
   natural principles; for the earth, as it occupies the lowest place,
   being the center of the world, naturally settles down there. But even
   in this contrivance there shines forth the wonderful power of God.
   Again, if the waters are higher than the earth, because they are
   lighter, why do they not cover the whole earth round about? Certainly
   the only answer which philosophers can give to this is, that the
   tendency of the waters to do so is counteracted by the providence of
   God, that a dwelling-place might be provided for man. If they do not
   admit that the waters are restrained by the determinate appointment of
   God, they betray not only their depravity and unthankfulness, but also
   their ignorance, and are altogether barbarous. The prophet, therefore,
   not without reason, recounts among the miracles of God, that which
   would be to us wholly incredible, did not even experience show its
   truth. We are very base indeed if, taught by such undoubted a proof, we
   do not learn that nothing in the world is stable except in as far as it
   is sustained by the hand of God. The world did not originate from
   itself, consequently, the whole order of nature depends on nothing else
   than his appointment, by which each element has its own peculiar
   property. Nor is the language of the prophet to be viewed merely as an
   exhortation to give thanks to God; it is also intended to strengthen
   our confidence in regard to the future, that we may not live in the
   world in a state of constant fear and anxiety, as we must have done had
   not God testified that he has given the earth for a habitation to men.
   It is a singular blessing, which he bestows upon us, in his causing us
   to dwell upon the earth with undisturbed minds, by giving us the
   assurance that he has established it upon everlasting pillars. Although
   cities often perish by earthquakes, yet the body of the earth itself
   remains. Yea, all the agitations which befall it more fully confirm to
   us the truth, that the earth would be swallowed up every moment were it
   not preserved by the secret power of God.

   6. He hath covered it with the deep as with a garment, This may be
   understood in two ways, either as implying that now the sea covers the
   earth as a garment, or that at the beginning, before God by his
   omnipotent word held gathered the waters together into one place, the
   earth was covered with the deep. But the more suitable sense appears to
   be, that the sea is now the covering of the earth. At the first
   creation the deep was not so much a garment as a grave, inasmuch as
   nothing bears less resemblance to the adorning of apparel than the
   state of confused desolation and shapeless chaos in which the earth
   then was. Accordingly, in my judgment, there is here celebrated that
   wonderful arrangement by which the deep, although without form, is yet
   the garment of the earth. But as the context seems to lead to a
   different view, interpreters are rather inclined to explain the
   language as denoting, That the earth was covered with the deep before
   the waters had been collected into a separate place. This difficulty is
   however easily solved, if the words of the prophet, The waters shall
   stand above the mountains, are resolved into the potential mood thus,
   The waters would stand above the mountains; which is sufficiently
   vindicated from the usage of the Hebrew language. I have indeed no
   doubt that the prophet, after having said that God had clothed the
   earth with waters, adds, by way of exposition, that the waters would
   stand above the mountains, were it not that they flee away at God's
   rebuke. Whence is it that the mountains are elevated, and that the
   valleys sink down, but because bounds are set to the waters, that they
   may not return to overwhelm the earth? The passage then, it is obvious,
   may very properly be understood thus, -- that the sea, although a
   mighty deep, which strikes terror by its vastness, is yet as a
   beautiful garment to the earth. The reason of the metaphor is, because
   the surface of the earth stands uncovered. The prophet affirms that
   this does not happen by chance; for, if the providence of God did not
   restrain the waters, would they not immediately rush forth to overwhelm
   the whole earth? He, therefore, speaks advisedly when he maintains that
   the appearance of any part of the earth's surface is not the effect of
   nature, but is an evident miracle. Were God to give loose reins to the
   sea, the waters would suddenly cover the mountains. But now, fleeing at
   God's rebuke, they retire to a different quarter. By the rebuke of God,
   and the voice of his thunder, is meant the awful command of God, by
   which he restrains the violent raging of the sea. Although at the
   beginning, by his word alone, he confined the sea within determinate
   bounds, and continues to this day to keep it within them, yet if we
   consider how tumultuously its billows cast up their foam when it is
   agitated, it is not without reason that the prophet speaks of it, as
   kept in check by the powerful command of God; just as, both in
   Jeremiah, (Jeremiah 5:22) and in Job, (Job 28:25) God, with much
   sublimity, commends his power, as displayed in the ocean. The ascending
   of the mountains, and the descending of the valleys, are poetical
   figures, implying, that unless God confined the deep within bounds, the
   distinction between mountains and valleys, which contributes to the
   beauty of the earth, would cease to exist, for it would engulf the
   whole earth. It is said that God has founded a place for the valleys;
   for there would be no dry land at the foot of the mountains, but the
   deep would bear sway, did not God command the space there to be
   unoccupied by the sea, as it were contrary to nature.

   9. Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass The miracle spoken
   of is in this verse amplified, from its perpetuity. Natural
   philosophers are compelled to admit, and it is even one of their first
   principles, that the water is circular, and occupies the region
   intermediate between the earth and the air. It is entirely owing to the
   providence of God, that part of the earth remains dry and fit for the
   habitation of men. This is a fact of which mariners have the most
   satisfactory evidence. Yea, were even the rudest and most stupid of our
   race only to open their eyes, they would behold in the sea mountains of
   water elevated far above the level of the land. Certainly no banks, and
   even no iron gates, could make the waters, which in their own nature
   are fluid and unstable, keep together and in one place, as we see to be
   the case. I have just now said that earthquakes, which bring
   destruction upon some places, leave the globe, upon the whole, as it
   was before; and in like manner, although the sea, in some parts of the
   world, overpasses its boundaries, yet the law, which confines it;
   within certain limits, stands fast, that the earth may be a fit
   habitation for men. The Baltic Sea, in our own time, inundated large
   tracts of land, and did great damage to the Flemish people and other
   neighboring nations. By an instance of this kind we are warned what
   would be the consequence, were the restraint imposed upon the sea, by
   the hand of God, removed. How is it that we have not thereby been
   swallowed up together, but because God has held in that outrageous
   element by his word? In short, although the natural tendency of the
   waters is to cover the earth, yet this will not happen, because God has
   established, by his word, a counteracting law, and as his truth is
   eternal, this law must remain steadfast.

   [180] "The waters, by a beautiful prosopopoeia, are supposed to be put
   into a panic at the voice of Jehovah. See Psalm 77:16" -- Dimock.

   [181] Calvin here renders mountains and valleys in the nominative case.
   In our English version they are rendered in the accusative: "They go up
   by the mountains, they go down by the valleys." "It is not here
   certain," says Hammond, "whether hrym, mountains, and vqvt, valleys or
   plains, be to be read in the nominative or in the accusative case. If
   they be in the nominative, then we must read as in a parenthesis, (the
   mountains ascend, the plains or valleys slink down,') joining the end
   of the verse, unto the place,' etc. to haste away,' verse 7, thus: The
   waters once stood above the mountains, -- those places which now are
   such; -- but at the uttering God's voice, they fled and hasted away
   (the mountains ascending and the valleys descending) unto the place
   which thou hast prepared for them.' Thus the LXX. and Latin understand
   it, anabainousin ore katabainousi pedia, ascendunt montes, et
   descendunt campi,' the mountains ascend, and the plains descend,'
   referring to the change that was made in the earth from being perfectly
   round and encompassed with waters, into that inequality wherein now it
   is, great mountains in some parts, and great cavities in other parts,
   wherein the waters were disposed, which before covered the face of the
   earth. But they may be more probably in the accusative case, and then
   mym, the waters,' verse 6, which were understood, verse 7, though not
   mentioned, (for it was the waters that there fled and hasted away,)
   must be here continued also, viz., that the waters ylv, ascend,' or
   climb the mountains,' and yrdv, descend,' or fall down upon the
   valleys,' or fissures,' or hollow places,' ditches, and the like
   receptacles of waters, (for so vqv now signifies among the Rabbins.)
   And this sense the Chaldee follows, They ascend from the abyss to the
   mountains, and they descend into the valleys, to the place,' etc. And
   this is the clearest exposition of it, rendering an account of the
   course of waters, since the gathering of them together in the ocean,
   that from thence they are, by the power of God, directed to pass
   through subterranean meatus to the uppermost parts of the earth, the
   hills and mountains, where they break forth in springs, and then, by
   their natural weight, descend, and either find or make channels, by
   which they run into the ocean again, that mqvm, place, which God hath
   hewed out as a receptacle for them; and by their thus passing, they are
   profitable for the use of men, in watering the cattle, and the fruits
   that grow in the earth, verse 10, etc."

   Psalm 104:10-15

   10. Sending out springs by the valleys, which shall run between [182]
   the hills. 11. All the beasts of the field shall drink thereof: the
   wild asses [183] shall quench [184] their thirst. 12. Nigh them the
   fowls of the air shall dwell, from the midst of the branches they shall
   send out their voice. [185] 13. Watering the mountains from his
   chambers: the earth shall be satisfied from the fruit of thy [186]
   works. 14. Making grass to grow for cattle, and herb for the service of
   man: that he may produce bread out of the earth. 15. And wine cheereth
   the heart of man, to make his face to shine with oil, and bread
   sustaineth man's heart. [187]


   10. Sending out springs by the valleys The Psalmist here describes
   another instance both of the power and goodness of God, which is, that
   he makes fountains to gush out in the mountains, and to run down
   through the midst of the valleys. Although it is necessary for the
   earth to be dry, to render it a fit habitation for us, yet, unless we
   had water to drink, and unless the earth opened her veins, all kinds of
   living creatures would perish. The prophet, therefore, speaks in
   commendation of that arrangement by which the earth, though dry, yet
   supplies us with water by its moisture. The word nchlym, nechalim,
   which I have rendered springs, is by some translated, torrents or
   rivers; but springs is more appropriate. In the same sense it is added
   immediately after, that they run among the hills; and yet, it is
   scarcely credible that fountains could spring forth from rocks and
   stony places. But here it may be asked, why the prophet says that the
   beasts of the field quench their thirst, rather than men, for whose
   sake the world was created? I would observe, in reply, that he
   obviously spake in this manner, for the purpose of enhancing the
   goodness of God, who vouchsafes to extend his care to the brute
   creation, yea, even to the wild asses, under which species are included
   all other kinds of wild beasts. And he purposely refers to desert
   places, that each of us may compare with them the more pleasant, and
   the cultivated parts of the earth, afterwards mentioned. Rivers run
   even through great and desolate wildernesses, where the wild beasts
   enjoy some blessing of God; and no country is so barren as not to have
   trees growing here and there, on which birds make the air to resound
   with the melody of their singing. Since even those regions where all
   lies waste and uncultivated, furnish manifest tokens of the Divine
   goodness and power, with what admiration ought we to regard that most
   abundant supply of all good things, which is to be seen in cultivated
   and favorable regions? Surely in countries where not only one river
   flows, or where not only grass grows for the feeding of wild beasts, or
   where the singing of birds is heard not only from a few trees, but
   where a manifold and varied abundance of good things everywhere
   presents itself to our view, our stupidity is more than brutish, if our
   minds, by such manifestations of the goodness of God, are not fixed in
   devout meditation on his glory.

   The same subject is prosecuted in the 13th verse, where it is said that
   God watereth the mountains from his chambers It is no ordinary miracle
   that the mountains, which seem to be condemned to perpetual drought,
   and which, in a manner, are suspended in the air, nevertheless abound
   in pastures. The prophet, therefore, justly concludes that this
   fruitfulness proceeds from nothing else but the agency of God, who is
   their secret cultivator. Labour cannot indeed, in the proper sense, be
   attributed to God, but still it is not without reason applied to him,
   for, by merely blessing the earth from the place of his repose, he
   works more efficaciously than if all the men in the world were to waste
   themselves by incessant labor.

   14. Making grass to grow for cattle The Psalmist now comes to men, of
   whom God vouchsafes to take a special care as his children. After
   having spoken of the brute creation, he declares, that corn is
   produced, and bread made of it, for the nourishment of the human race;
   and he mentions in addition to this, wine and oil, two things which not
   only supply the need of mankind, but also contribute to their cheerful
   enjoyment of life. Some understand the Hebrew word lvdt, laäbodath,
   which I have rendered for the service, to denote the labor which men
   bestow in husbandry; for while grass grows on the mountains of itself,
   and without human labor, corn and herbs, which are sown, can only be
   produced, as is well known, by the labor and sweat of men. According to
   them the meaning is, that God blesses the toil of men in the
   cultivation of the fields. But this being too strained an
   interpretation, it is better to understand the word service, in the
   ordinary sense of the term. With respect to the word bread, I do not
   object to the view of those who understand it in a restricted sense,
   although it probably includes all kinds of food; only I dislike the
   opinion of those who exclude bread. There is no force in the reason
   which they allege for taking this view, namely, that in the following
   verse another use of bread is added, when it is said, that it
   strengthens the heart of man; for there the same thing is expressed in
   different words. The prophet, in stating that God causeth the earth to
   bring forth herbs for the support of men, intends to say that the earth
   supplies them not only with food in corn, but also with other herbs and
   fruits; for the means of our sustenance is not limited exclusively to
   one kind of food.

   15. And wine that cheereth the heart of man In these words we are
   taught, that God not only provides for men's necessity, and bestows
   upon them as much as is sufficient for the ordinary purposes of life,
   but that in his goodness he deals still more bountifully with them by
   cheering their hearts with wine and oil. Nature would certainly be
   satisfied with water to drink; and therefore the addition of wine is
   owing to God's superabundant liberality. The expression, and oil to
   make his face to shine, has been explained in different ways. As
   sadness spreads a gloom over the countenance, some give this
   exposition, That when men enjoy the commodities of wine and oil, their
   faces shine with gladness. Some with more refinement of interpretation,
   but without foundation, refer this to lamps. Others, considering the
   letter m, mem to be the sign of the comparative degree, take the
   meaning to be, that wine makes men's faces shine more than if they were
   anointed with oil. But the prophet, I have no doubt, speaks of
   unguents, intimating that God not only bestows upon men what is
   sufficient for their moderate use, but that he goes beyond this, giving
   them even their delicacies.

   The words in the last clause, and bread that sustains man's heart, I
   interpret thus: Bread would be sufficient to support the life of man,
   but God over and above, to use a common expression, bestows upon them
   wine and oil. The repetition then of the purpose which bread serves is
   not superfluous: it is employed to commend to us the goodness of God in
   his tenderly and abundantly nourishing men as a kind-hearted father
   does his children. For this reason, it is here stated again, that as
   God shows himself a foster-father sufficiently bountiful in providing
   bread, his liberality appears still more conspicuous in giving us
   dainties.

   But as there is nothing to which we are more prone, than to abuse God's
   benefits by giving way to excess, the more bountiful he is towards men,
   the more ought they to take care not to pollute, by their intemperance,
   the abundance which is presented before them. Paul had therefore good
   reason for giving that prohibition, (Romans 13:14)

   "Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof;"

   for if we give full scope to the desires of the flesh, there will be no
   bounds. As God bountifully provides for us, so he has appointed a law
   of temperance, that each may voluntarily restrain himself in his
   abundance. He sends out oxen and asses into pastures, and they content
   themselves with a sufficiency; but while furnishing us with more than
   we need, he enjoins upon us an observance of the rules of moderation,
   that we may not voraciously devour his benefits; and in lavishing upon
   us a more abundant supply of good things than our necessities require,
   he puts our moderation to the test. The proper rule with respect to the
   use of bodily sustenance, is to partake of it that it may sustain, but
   not oppress us. The mutual communication of the things needful for the
   support of the body, which God has enjoined upon us, is a very good
   check to intemperance; for the condition upon which the rich are
   favored with their abundance is, that they should relieve the wants of
   their brethren. As the prophet in this account of the divine goodness
   in providence makes no reference to the excesses of men, we gather from
   his words that it is lawful to use wine not only in cases of necessity,
   but also thereby to make us merry. This mirth must however be tempered
   with sobriety, first, that men may not forget themselves, drown their
   senses, and destroy their strength, but rejoice before their God,
   according to the injunction of Moses, (Leviticus 23:40;) and, secondly,
   that they may exhilarate their minds under a sense of gratitude, so as
   to be rendered more active in the service of God. He who rejoices in
   this way will also be always prepared to endure sadness, whenever God
   is pleased to send it. That rule of Paul ought to be kept in mind,
   (Philippians 4:12,)

   "I have learned to abound, -- I have learned to suffer want."

   If some token of the divine anger is manifest, even he who has an
   overflowing abundance of all kinds of dainty food, will restrict
   himself in his diet knowing that he is called to put on sackcloth, and
   to sit among ashes. Much more ought he whom poverty compels to be
   temperate and sober, to abstain from such delicacies. In short, if one
   man is constrained to abstain from wine by sickness, if another has
   only vapid wine, and a third nothing but water, let each be content
   with his own lot, and willingly and submissively wean himself from
   those gratifications which God denies him.

   The same remarks apply to oil. We see from this passage that ointments
   were much in use among the Jews, as well as among the other eastern
   nations. At the present day, it is different with us, who rather keep
   ointments for medicinal purposes, than use them as articles of luxury.
   The prophet, however, says, that oil also is given to men, that they
   may anoint themselves therewith. But as men are too prone to pleasure,
   it is to be observed, that the law of temperance ought not to be
   separated from the beneficence of God, lest they abuse their liberty by
   indulging in luxurious excess. This exception must always be added,
   that no person may take encouragement from this doctrine to
   licentiousness.

   Moreover, when men have been carefully taught to bridle their lust, it
   is important for them to know, that God permits them to enjoy pleasures
   in moderation, where there is the ability to provide them; else they
   will never partake even of bread and wine with a tranquil conscience;
   yea, they will begin to scruple about the tasting of water, at least
   they will never come to the table but in fearfulness. Meanwhile, the
   greater part of the world will wallow in pleasures without
   discrimination, because they do not consider what God permits them; for
   his fatherly kindness should be to us the best mistress to teach us
   moderation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [182] In our English version it is among; but between is the more
   proper rendering. "vyn," says Hammond, "must be rendered, not among but
   between, anameson, say the LXX., to denote the hollow receptacles for
   waters betwixt the hills, or risings of the ground on both sides."

   [183] The wild ass differs from the tame only by being stronger and
   nimbler, more courageous and lively. Wild asses are still found in
   considerable numbers in the deserts of Great Tartary, in Persia, Syria,
   the islands of the Archipelago, and throughout Mauritania. They are
   gregarious, and have been known to assemble by hundreds and thousands.
   It has been observed of these animals that, though dull and stupid,
   they are remarkable for their instinct in discovering in the arid
   desert the way to rivers, brooks, or fountains of water, so that the
   thirsty traveler has only to observe and follow their steps, in order
   to his being led to the cooling stream.

   [184] The literal rendering of the Hebrew word ysvrv, yeshberu, is
   shall break, being derived from svr, shabar, to break. As applied to
   hunger, it must signify to allay, or, as here, to thirst, it must mean
   to quench. The phrase is communicated to other languages, and is usual
   among us, who, by breaking of fasting, understand eating.

   [185] "From between these boughs or leaves the fowls of the air send
   out their voice'; not by singing only, (for that is peculiar to few,)
   but by making any noise that is proper to them " -- Hammond. On the
   10th, 11th, and 12th verses, Dimock observes, -- "The murmuring brooks,
   the great number of beasts and cattle, with the melodious birds, afford
   a most picturesque scene of rural delight."

   [186] In the preceding clause God is spoken of in the third person, and
   here in the second. The change of persons from the second to the third,
   and from the third to the second, is very observable throughout this
   psalm. -- See [10]page 143, note.

   [187] In the French version it is, "Et le vin qui resjouit le coeur de
   l'homme, et l'huile pour faire reluire sa face, et le pain qui
   soustient le coeur de l'homme." -- "And wine that cheereth the heart of
   man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread that sustains the
   heart of man "

   Psalm 104:16-18

   16. The trees of Jehovah [188] shall be satiated; the cedars of
   Lebanon, which he hath planted; 17. For there the birds build their
   nests: the stork, [189] whose dwelling is the fir trees. 18. The high
   mountains are for the deer [190] and the rocks are a place of shelter
   for the hedgehogs. [191]


   16. The trees of Jehovah shall be satiated The Psalmist again treats of
   God's general providence in cherishing all the parts of the world. In
   the first place, he asserts, that by the watering of which he had
   spoken the trees are satiated, or filled with sap, that thus
   flourishing they may be a place of abode to the birds. He next
   declares, that the wild deer and conies have also their places of
   shelter, to show that no part of the world is forgotten by Him, who is
   the best of fathers, and that no creature is excluded from his care.
   The transition which the prophet makes from men to trees is as if he
   had said, It is not to be wondered at, if God so bountifully nourishes
   men who are created after his own image, since he does not grudge to
   extend his care even to trees. By the trees of the Lord, is meant those
   which are high and of surpassing beauty; for God's blessing is more
   conspicuous in them. It seems scarcely possible for any juice of the
   earth to reach so great a height, and yet they renew their foliage
   every year.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [188] "In the Septuagint it is, xula tou pediou, trees of the field;'
   they, therefore, read tsy sdy; and sdybeing a name of the Almighty,
   when differently pointed, thus, sdy, was afterwards changed to yhvh,
   Jehovah,' as the text now is. Theodoret notices in his time, that the
   Hebrew, and other Greek interpreters of it, had xula tou kuriou, trees
   of the Lord.' So was the Hebrew in Jerome's time, who has it ligna
   Domini." -- Reeves' Collation, etc.

   [189] "chsydh, chasidah, the original word for the stork, is from chsd,
   piety, beneficence, because, says Bythner, "the stork nourishes,
   supports, and carries on its back, when weary, its aged parents."
   Storks are a species of birds very numerous in Palestine, and other
   eastern countries. Doubdan thus speaks of them in his account of a
   journey from Cana to Nazareth in Galilee, (page 513,) "All these fields
   were so filled with flocks of storks, that they appeared quite white
   with them, there being above a thousand in each flock, and when they
   rose and hovered in the air they seemed like clouds. The evening they
   rest in trees." This account is confirmed by Dr Shaw, who informs us,
   that as he lay at anchor near Mount Carmel, he saw "three flights of
   them, some of which were more open and scattered, with larger intervals
   between them; others were closer and more compact, as in the flight of
   wrens and other birds, each of which took up more than three hours in
   passing by us, extending itself at the same time more than half a mile
   in breadth." -- See his Travels, volume 2, page 269. The stork
   constructs her nest with exquisite skill of dry twigs of trees and
   coarse grass from the marsh. But instead of confining herself to one
   situation, she builds it sometimes on the highest parts of old ruins
   and houses, -- sometimes in the canals of ancient aqueducts, and
   sometimes on the tops of the eastern mosques and dwelling-houses; so
   very familiar is she by being never molested, the Mahometans accounting
   it profane to kill, or even to hurt, or disturb this species of bird,
   because of their important services in clearing the country of
   serpents, and other venomous animals, on which they feed. She
   frequently retires from the noise and bustle of the town to the
   adjacent field, selecting the highest tree of the forest on which to
   build her nest, and always preferring the fir, when it is equally
   suitable to her purpose -- Ibid. volume 2, page 272. Harmer remarks,
   that chsydh, chasidah, seems to signify the heron as well as the stork;
   and Dr Adam Clarke is of opinion, that the heron is here meant,
   conceiving the description of its making the fir-tree its house, as
   other bird.make their nests in the cedars of Lebanon, to be more
   agreeable to its natural history than to that of the stork properly
   speaking. He farther observes, that Aquila, who has given us an ancient
   Greek translation of the Old Testament, and who is said to have been
   exquisitely skilled in the original language, always understood the
   chasidah to mean the heron, rather than the stork. "But," he adds, "the
   two species resemble each other so much, that it is not improbable but
   one Hebrew word stood for both," and refers to Doubdan, who supposes
   that storks in Palestine roost in trees -- Harmer's Observations,
   volume 2, page 465, and volume 3, page 338.

   [190] "On, chevreux." -- Fr. marg. "Or, the kids." Calvin, by giving
   two different translations of the original word, appears to have been
   at a loss as to the animal meant. "The animal here intended," says
   Mant, "is the Ibex or Rock Goat, a species of wild goat, deriving its
   Hebrew name from the wonderful manner in which it mounts to the top of
   the highest rocks, to which quality the sacred writers allude in the
   other two passages where the word occurs as well as in this. -- See 1
   Samuel 24:3; Job 39:1. To this quality natural historians bear abundant
   witness. Mr Cox thus describes the action of the Ibex, in ascending the
   mountains of Switzerland: -- He mounts a perpendicular rock of fifteen
   feet at three leaps, or rather three successive bounds of five feet
   each. It does not seem as if he found any footing on the rock,
   appearing to touch it merely to be repelled, like an elastic substance
   striking against a hard body. He is not supposed to take more than
   three successive leaps in this manner. If he is between two rocks which
   are near each other, and wants to reach the top, he leaps from the side
   of one rock to the other alternately, till he has obtained the
   summit.'"

   [191] "Ou, connils." -- Fr marg. "Or, the conies, or rabbits." The
   Hebrew name of this animal, sphn, shaphan, from the verbs sphn,
   shaphan, or sphn, saphan, to hide, seems to indicate a creature of a
   timid and harmless disposition. Feeble, and apprehensive of danger, it
   seeks a shelter among the fissures of the rocks, where it may be
   concealed from its enemies. To this circumstance allusion is here made;
   and it is also referred to by Solomon, (Proverbs 30:26) "The shaphans
   are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks." It is
   evident from these words, that the shaphan is gregarious. What
   particular animal then is indicated by this name? Calvin, from giving
   the original term, one translation in the text, and a different one on
   the margin, seems to have been uncertain as to the species of animal
   intended, and on this point considerable variety of opinion has
   obtained. Some copies of the Septuagint have hedgehogs, and others,
   hares, the former being probably the right reading, as the Vulgate
   agrees with it. Bochart supposed the jerboa, or jumping-mouse, to be
   meant. But to this it has been justly objected, that the jerboa always
   digs its habitation in the smoother places of the desert, especially
   where the soil is fixed gravel; that it is not gregarious, nor
   distinguished by feebleness, which it supplies by its wisdom. Nor can
   it be the coney, or rabbit, that is here referred to; for, instead of
   seeking a habitation among the rocks, it delights to burrow in the
   sandy downs; and if it sometimes digs a place of shelter among the
   rocks, it is only where the openings are filled with earth. It is now
   pretty generally agreed, that the shaphan is the Daman Israel, as
   suggested by Dr Shaw. "The Daman Israel," says this traveler, "is an
   animal likewise of Mount Lebanus, though common in other places of this
   country. It is a harmless creature, of the same size and quality with
   the rabbit, and with the like incurvating posture and disposition of
   the fore-teeth. But it is of a browner color with smaller eyes, and a
   head more pointed, like the marmots. The fore-feet likewise are short,
   and the hinder are nearly as long in proportion as those of the jerboa.
   Though this animal is known to burrow sometimes in the ground, yet as
   its usual residence and refuge is in the holes and clifts of the rocks,
   we have so far a more presumptive proof, that this creature may be the
   shaphan of the Scriptures, than the jerboa. I could not learn why it
   was called Daman Israel, i.e., Israel's lamb, as those words are
   interpreted." Travels, volume 2, pages 160, 161. It is called in
   Amhara, "Ashkoko." Bruce confirms Dr Shaw's opinion. He identifies the
   animals by the several other particulars mentioned in Scripture, as
   well as by their attachment to rocks, and their constant residence in
   holes and caves, as noticed in this psalm. See also Paxton's
   Illustrations of Scripture, volume 2, pages 204-209.

   Psalm 102:19-22

   19. He hath appointed the moon to distinguish seasons: the sun knoweth
   his going down. 20. Thou makest darkness, and it is night; wherein all
   the beasts of the forest creep forth. 21. The lions roar after their
   prey, and in seeking their food from God. [192] 22. The sun shall rise,
   and they shall gather themselves together, and lie down in their dens.
   [193] 23. Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labor, until the
   evening.


   19. He hath appointed the moon to distinguish seasons The Psalmist now
   comes to another commendation of God's providence as manifested in the
   beautiful arrangement by which the course of the sun and moon
   alternately succeeds each other; for the diversity in their mutual
   changes is so far from producing confusion, that all must easily
   perceive the impossibility of finding any better method of
   distinguishing time. When it is said, that the moon was appointed to
   distinguish seasons, interpreters agree that this is to be understood
   of the ordinary and appointed feasts. The Hebrews having been
   accustomed to compute their months by the moon, this served for
   regulating their festival days and assemblies, both sacred and
   political. [194] The prophet, I have no doubt, by the figure
   synecdoche, puts a part for the whole, intimating, that the moon not
   only distinguishes the days from the nights, but likewise marks out the
   festival days, measures years and months, and, in fine, answers many
   useful purposes, inasmuch as the distinction of times is taken from her
   course. As to the sentence, The sun knoweth his going down, I
   understand it not only of his daily circuit, but as also denoting that
   by gradually approaching nearer us at one time, and receding farther
   from us at another, he knows how to regulate his movements by which to
   make summer, winter, spring, and autumn. It is farther stated, that the
   beasts of the forest creep forth during the night, because they go out
   of their dens with fear. Some translate the verb rms, ramas, to walk;
   but its proper signification which I have given is not unsuitable; for
   although hunger often drives wild beasts into fury, yet they watch for
   the darkness of the night, that they may move abroad from their
   hiding-places, and on account of this fearfulness they are said to
   creep forth.

   21. The lions roar after their prey Although lions, if hunger compels
   them, go forth from their dens and roar even at noon-day, yet the
   prophet describes what is most usually the case. He therefore says,
   that lions do not venture to go abroad during the daytime, but that,
   trusting to the darkness of the night, they then sally forth in quest
   of their prey. Herein is manifested the wonderful providence of God,
   that a beast so dreadful confines itself within its den, that men may
   walk abroad with the greater freedom. And if lions sometimes range with
   greater liberty, this is to be imputed to the fall of Adam, which has
   deprived men of their dominion over the wild beasts. There are,
   however, still some remains of the original blessing conferred by God
   on men, inasmuch as he holds in check so many wild beasts by the light
   of day, as if by iron cages or chains. The expression, They seek their
   food from God, is not to be understood of their casting themselves upon
   the care of God, as if they acknowledged him to be their foster-father,
   but it points out the fact itself, that God in a wonderful manner
   provides food for such ravenous beasts.

   22. The sun shall rise The Psalmist continues to prosecute the same
   subject, showing that God so distributes the successions of time, as
   that the day belongs properly to man. Did not God put a restraint upon
   so many wild beasts which are hostile to us, the human race would soon
   become extinct. As wild beasts since the fall of man may seem to be
   born to do us hurt, and to rend and tear in pieces all whom they meet
   with, this savage cruelty must be kept under check by the providence of
   God. And in order to keep them shut up within their dens, the only
   means which he employs is to inspire them with terror, simply by the
   light of the sun. This instance of divine goodness, the prophet
   commends the more on account of its necessity; for were it otherwise,
   men would have no liberty to go forth to engage in the labors and
   business of life. Man being thus protected by the light against the
   violence and injuries of wild beasts, in this is to be seen the
   unparalleled goodness of God, who in so fatherly a manner has provided
   for his convenience and welfare.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [192] "What is here said of the lions peculiarly, that they roar after
   their prey, and seek their meat from God,' may be illustrated by what
   is observed of those creatures, that to their great strength and
   greediness and rapacity, they are not proportionably provided with
   swiftness of body to pursue in the desert those beasts on which they
   prey, nor yet so quick-scented, as to be able to follow and trace them
   to their places of repose. It hath therefore been necessary to the
   providing for these animals, that some supply should be made to these
   defects by some other way. And it hath been affirmed by some, that
   their very roaring is useful to them for this end, and that when they
   cannot overtake their prey, they do by that fierce noise so astonish
   and amaze the poor beasts, that they fall down before them. If this
   have that truth, which it professes to have, it gives a clear account
   both of the phrase of roaring after their prey, and of seeking it from
   God -- of roaring, as being able to do nothing else toward the getting
   it, but only thus to frighten the hearers, and express his own hunger
   and want." -- Hammond.

   Psalm 104:24-26

   24. O Jehovah! how magnificent are thy works! thou hast made all things
   in wisdom: the earth is full of thy riches. 25. Great is this sea, and
   wide in extent; therein are things creeping innumerable, both small and
   great animals. 26. There go the ships [195] and the leviathan, which
   thou hast made to sport itself in it.


   24. O Jehovah! how magnificent are thy works The prophet does not make
   a full enumeration of the works of God, which would be an endless task,
   but only touches upon certain particulars, that every one may be led
   from the consideration of them to reflect the more attentively on that
   wisdom by which God governs the whole world, and every particular part
   of it. Accordingly, breaking off his description, he exclaims with
   admiration, -- How greatly to be praised are thy works! even as we then
   only ascribe to God due honor when seized with astonishment, we
   acknowledge that our tongues and all our senses fail us in doing
   justice to so great a subject. If a small portion of the works of God
   make us amazed, how inadequate are our feeble minds to comprehend the
   whole extent of them! In the first place, it is said, that God has made
   all things in wisdom, and then it is added, that the earth is full of
   his riches The mention of wisdom only is not intended to exclude the
   divine power, but the meaning is, that there is nothing in the world
   confused, -- that, so far from this, the vast variety of things mixed
   together in it are arranged with the greatest wisdom, so as to render
   it impossible for any thing to be added, abstracted, or improved. This
   commendation is set in opposition to the unhallowed imaginations, which
   often creep upon us when we are unable to discover the designs of God
   in his works, as if indeed he were subject to folly like ourselves, so
   as to be forced to bear the reprehension of those who are blind in the
   consideration of his works. The prophet also, by the same eulogium,
   reproves the madness of those who dream, that the world has been
   brought into its present form by chance, as Epicurus raved about the
   elements being composed of atoms. As it is an imagination more than
   irrational to suppose, that a fabric so elegant, and of such surpassing
   embellishment, was put together by the fortuitous concourse of atoms,
   the prophet here bids us attend more carefully to the wisdom of God,
   and to that wonderful skill which shines forth in the whole government
   of the world. Under riches are comprehended the goodness and
   beneficence of God; for it is not on his own account that he has so
   richly replenished the earth but on ours, that nothing which
   contributes to our advantage may be wanting. We ought to know that the
   earth does not possess such fruitfulness and riches of itself, but
   solely by the blessing of God, who makes it the means of administering
   to us his bounty.

   25. Great is this sea, and wide in extent After having treated of the
   evidences which the earth affords of the glory of God, the prophet goes
   down into the sea, and teaches us that it is a new mirror in which may
   be beheld the divine power and wisdom. Although the sea were not
   inhabited by fishes, yet the mere view of its vastness would excite our
   wonder, especially when at one time it swells with the winds and
   tempests, while at another it is calm and unruffled. Again, although
   navigation is an art which has been acquired by the skill of men, yet
   it depends on the providence of God, who has granted to men a passage
   through the mighty deep. But the abundance and variety of fishes
   enhance in no small degree the glory of God in the sea. Of these the
   Psalmist celebrates especially the leviathan or the whale [196] because
   this animal, though there were no more, presents to our view a
   sufficient, yea, more than a sufficient, proof of the dreadful power of
   God, and for the same reason, we have a lengthened account of it in the
   book of Job. As its movements not only throw the sea into great
   agitation, but also strike with alarm the hearts of men, the prophet,
   by the word sport, intimates that these its movements are only sport in
   respect of God; as if he had said, The sea is given to the leviathans,
   as a field in which to exercise themselves.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [195] Fry reads in the text, "There pass the ships," and at the foot of
   the page, "There go the whales." "I cannot," says he, "but indulge a
   conjecture in this place, that either the word we translate ships had
   anciently another meaning, and signified some aquatic animal; or that
   for 'nyvt, we should read tnynym, or tnym: compare Genesis 1:21, And
   God created great whales, chnynym hgdlym, and every living creature
   that moveth, hrmst hchyh, which the waters brought forth abundantly
   after their kind.' It has, however, been thought by some, that not
   whales, but some large marine animals, known on the shores of the
   Mediterranean Sea, are intended by the term." -- "The first line of
   this verse," says Dimock, "should probably be read in a parenthesis, if
   it is not an interpolation; and the grammatical construction requires
   that we should read hlkvn. That wonderful piece of mechanism, a ship,
   whereby man becomes the lord of the sea, seems to have been originally
   constructed under the divine direction. -- See Genesis 6:14."

   [196] The leviathan, which is described at large in Job 40., is now
   generally understood by commentators to be not the whale, but the
   crocodile, an inhabitant of the Nile. That it should here be numbered
   with the marine animals, need not surprise us, as the object of the
   divine poet is merely to display the kingdom of the watery world. Of
   these wide domains the sea of the Nile forms, in his view, a part. "ym
   transfertur ad omnia flumina majora. Est igitur in specie Nilus. Jes.
   19, 5; Nab. 3, 8." -- Sire. Lex. Heb. -- See [11]volume 3, page 175,

   Psalm 104:27-30

   27. All things wait upon thee, that thou mayest give them food in their
   season. 28. Thou shalt give it to them, and they shall gather it: thou
   shalt open thy hand, and they shall be filled [or satiated] with good.
   29. Thou shalt hide thy face, and they shall be afraid: thou shalt take
   away their spirit, and they shall die, and return to their dust. 30.
   Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: [197] and
   thou shalt renew the face of the earth.


   27. All these wait upon thee The prophet here again describes God as
   acting the part of the master of a household, and a foster-father
   towards all sorts of living creatures, by providing liberally for them.
   He had said before, that God made food to grow on the mountains for the
   support of cattle, and that sustenance is ministered to the very lions
   by the hand of the same God, although they live upon prey. Now he
   amplifies this wonder of the divine beneficence by an additional
   circumstance. While the different species of living creatures are
   almost innumerable, and the number in each species is so great, there
   is yet not one of them which does not stand in need of daily food. The
   meaning then of the expression, All things wait upon thee, is, that
   they could not continue in existence even for a few days, unless God
   were to supply their daily need, and to nourish each of them in
   particular. We thus see why there is so great a diversity of fruits;
   for God assigns and appoints to each species of living creatures the
   food suitable and proper for them. The brute beasts are not indeed
   endued with reason and judgment to seek the supply of their wants from
   God, but stooping towards the earth, they seek to fill themselves with
   food; still the prophet speaks with propriety, when he represents them
   as waiting upon God; for their hunger must be relieved by his bounty,
   else they would soon die. Nor is the specification of the season when
   God furnishes them with food superfluous, since God lays up in store
   for them, that they may have the means of sustenance during the whole
   course of the year. As the earth in winter shuts up her bowels, what
   would become of them if he did not provide them with food for a long
   time? The miracle, then, is the greater from the circumstance, that
   God, by making the earth fruitful at stated seasons, extends in this
   way his blessing to the rest of the year which threatens us with hunger
   and famine. How wretched would we be when the earth in winter shuts up
   her riches, were not our hearts cheered with the hope of a new
   increase? In this sense, the Psalmist appropriately affirms, that God
   opens his hand If wheat should grow up daily, God's providence would
   not be so manifest. But when the earth becomes barren, it is as if God
   shut his hand. Whence it follows, that when he makes it fruitful, he,
   so to speak, stretches out his hand from heaven to give us food. Now if
   he supply wild and brute beasts with sustenance in due season, by which
   they are fed to the full, his blessing will doubtless be to us as an
   inexhaustible source of plenty, provided we ourselves do not hinder it
   from flowing to us by our unbelief.

   29 Thou shalt hide thy face, and they shall be afraid In these words,
   the Psalmist declares, that we stand or fall according to the will of
   God. We continue to live, so long as he sustains us by his power; but
   no sooner does he withdraw his life-giving spirit than we die. Even
   Plato knew this, who so often teaches that, properly speaking, there is
   but one God, and that all things subsist, or have their being only in
   him. Nor do I doubt, that it was the will of God, by means of that
   heathen writer, to awaken all men to the knowledge, that they derive
   their life from another source than from themselves. In the first
   place, the Psalmist asserts, that if God hide his face they are afraid;
   and, secondly, that if he take away their spirit they die, and return
   to their dust; by which words he points out, that when God vouchsafes
   to look upon us, that look gives us life, and that as long as his
   serene countenance shines, it inspires all the creatures with life. Our
   blindness then is doubly inexcusable, if we do not on our part cast our
   eyes upon that goodness which gives life to the whole world. The
   prophet describes step by step the destruction of living creatures,
   upon God's withdrawing from them his secret energy, that from the
   contrast he may the better commend that continued inspiration, by which
   all things are maintained in life and rigor. He could have gone
   farther, and have asserted, that all things, unless upheld in being by
   God, would return to nothing; but he was content with affirming in
   general and popular language, that whatever is not cherished by Him
   falls into corruption. He again declares, that the world is daily
   renewed, because God sends forth his spirit In the propagation of
   living creatures, we doubtless see continually a new creation of the
   world. In now calling that God's spirit, which he before represented as
   the spirit of living creatures, there is no contradiction. God sendeth
   forth that spirit which remains with him whither he pleases; and as
   soon as he has sent it forth, all things are created. In this way, what
   was his own he makes to be ours. But this gives no countenance to the
   old dream of the Manicheeans, which that filthy dog Servetus has made
   still worse in our own day. The Manicheeans said that the soul of man
   is a particle of the Divine Spirit, and is propagated from it as the
   shoot of a tree; but this base man has had the audacity to assert, that
   oxen, asses, and dogs, are parts of the divine essence. The Manichees
   at least had this pretext for their error, that the soul was created
   after the image of God; but to maintain this with respect to swine and
   cattle, is in the highest degree monstrous and detestable. Nothing was
   farther from the prophet's intention, than to divide the spirit of God
   into parts, so that a portion of it should dwell essentially in every
   living creature. But he termed that the spirit of God which proceeds
   from him. By the way, he instructs us, that it is ours, because it is
   given us, that it may quicken us. The amount of what is stated is, that
   when we see the world daily decaying, and daily renewed, the
   life-giving power of God is reflected to us herein as in a mirror. All
   the deaths which take place among living creatures, are just so many
   examples of our nothingness, so to speak; and when others are produced
   and grow up in their room, we have in that presented to us a renewal of
   the world. Since then the world daily dies, and is daily renewed in its
   various parts, the manifest conclusion is, that it subsists only by a
   secret virtue derived from God.

   Psalm 104:31-35

   31. Glory be to Jehovah for ever; let Jehovah rejoice in his works. 32.
   When he looketh upon the earth, it shall tremble: if he touch the
   mountains, they shall smoke. [198] 33. I will sing to Jehovah whilst I
   live: I will sing psalms to my God as long as I have my being. [199]
   34. Let my speech [or words [200] ] be acceptable to him: [201] I will
   rejoice in Jehovah. 35. Let sinners perish from the earth, and the
   wicked till they cease to be any more. O my soul! bless thou Jehovah.
   Hallelujah.


   31. Glory be to Jehovah for ever The inspired writer shows for what
   purpose he has celebrated in the preceding part of the psalm the power,
   wisdom, and goodness of God in his works, namely, to stir up men to
   praise him. It is no small honor that God for our sake has so
   magnificently adorned the world, in order that we may not only be
   spectators of this beauteous theater, but also enjoy the multiplied
   abundance and variety of good things which are presented to us in it.
   Our gratitude in yielding to God the praise which is his due, is
   regarded by him as a singular recompense. What the Psalmist adds, Let
   Jehovah rejoice in his works, is not superfluous; for he desires that
   the order which God has established from the beginning may be continued
   in the lawful use of his gifts. As we read in Genesis 6:6, that "it
   repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth," so when he sees
   that the good things which he bestows are polluted by our corruptions,
   he ceases to take delight in bestowing them. And certainly the
   confusion and disorder which take place, when the elements cease to
   perform their office, testify that God, displeased and wearied out, is
   provoked to discontinue, and put a stop to the regular course of his
   beneficence; although anger and impatience have strictly speaking no
   place in his mind. What is here taught is, that he bears the character
   of the best of fathers, who takes pleasure in tenderly cherishing his
   children, and in bountifully nourishing them. In the following verse it
   is shown, that the stability of the world depends on this rejoicing of
   God in his works; for did he not give vigor to the earth by his
   gracious and fatherly regard, as soon as he looked upon it with a
   severe countenance, he would make it tremble, and would burn up the
   very mountains.

   33. I will sing to Jehovah whilst I live Here the Psalmist points out
   to others their duty by his own example, declaring, that throughout the
   whole course of his life he will proclaim the praises of God without
   ever growing weary of that exercise. The only boundary which he fixes
   to the celebration of God's praises is death; not that the saints, when
   they pass from this world into another state of existence, desist from
   this religious duty, but because the end for which we are created is,
   that the divine name may be celebrated by us on the earth. Conscious of
   his unworthiness to offer to God so precious a sacrifice, he humbly
   prays, (verse 34,) that the praises which he will sing to God may be
   acceptable to him, although they proceed from polluted lips. It is
   true, that there is nothing more acceptable to God, nor any thing of
   which he more approves, than the publication of his praises, even as
   there is no service which he more peculiarly requires us to perform.
   But as our uncleanness defiles that which in its own nature is most
   holy, the prophet with good reason betakes himself to the goodness of
   God, and on this ground alone pleads that He would accept of his song
   of praise. Accordingly, the Apostle, in Hebrews 13:15 teaches that our
   sacrifices of thanksgiving are well pleasing to God, when they are
   offered to him through Christ. It being however the case, that whilst
   all men indiscriminately enjoy the benefits of God, there are yet very
   few who look to the author of them, the prophet subjoins the clause, I
   will rejoice in the Lord; intimating, that this is a rare virtue; for
   nothing is more difficult than to call home the mind from those wild
   and erratic joys, which disperse themselves through heaven and earth in
   which they evanish, that it may keep itself fixed on God alone.

   35. Let sinners perish from the earth This imprecation depends on the
   last clause of the 31st verse, Let Jehovah rejoice in his works As the
   wicked infect the world with their pollutions, the consequence is, that
   God has less delight in his own workmanship, and is even almost
   displeased with it. It is impossible, but that this uncleanness, which,
   being extended and diffused through every part of the world, vitiates
   and corrupts such a noble product of his hands, must be offensive to
   him. Since then the wicked, by their perverse abuse of God's gifts,
   cause the world in a manner to degenerate and fall away from its first
   original, the prophet justly desires that they may be exterminated,
   until the race of them entirely fail. Let us then take care so to weigh
   the providence of God, as that being wholly devoted to obeying him, we
   may rightly and purely use the benefits which he sanctities for our
   enjoying them. Farther, let us be grieved, that such precious treasures
   are wickedly squandered away, and let us regard it as monstrous and
   detestable, that men not only forget their Maker, but also, as it were,
   purposely turn to a perverse and an unworthy end, whatever good things
   he has bestowed upon them.

   accord, "I will be glad in the Lord," which is an effect of the
   sweetness felt in meditating upon him. But all the ancient versions
   give the former rendering, according to these words in Psalm 19:14,

   PSALM 105

   The Psalmist magnifies the singular grace of God displayed in selecting
   and freely adopting one people from amongst all nations of the world.
   To show that it was not in word only that he had made a covenant with
   Abraham and his offspring, God did not cease, after having delivered
   them from Egypt, to confer upon them innumerable benefits; and his
   design in this was, that those who had been delivered might on their
   part faithfully keep his covenant, and devote themselves unfeignedly to
   his service. [202]

   Psalm 105:1-5

   1. Praise ye Jehovah; invoke his name: announce his works among the
   peoples. 2. Sing ye to him: sing psalms to him: speak ye of all his
   wonders. 3. Rejoice ye in his holy name: [203] let the heart of those
   who seek Jehovah rejoice. 4. Seek ye Jehovah, and his strength: seek
   his face continually. 5. Remember the marvelous works which he hath
   performed; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.


   1 Praise ye Jehovah, etc. The object of these opening words simply is,
   that the offspring of Abraham should place all their blessedness in the
   free adoption of God. It was indeed a blessing not to be despised that
   they had been created men, that they had been cherished in the world by
   God's fatherly care, and that they had received sustenance at his hand;
   but it was a far more distinguished privilege to have been chosen to be
   his peculiar people. While the whole human race are condemned in Adam,
   the condition of the Israelites was so different from all other
   nations, as to give them ground to boast, that they were consecrated to
   God. This is the reason why the prophet heaps together so many words in
   commendation of this grace. He does not treat of the government of the
   whole world as he did in the preceding psalm, but he celebrates the
   fatherly favor which God had manifested towards the children of Israel.
   He indeed names in general his works, and his wonders, but he limits
   both to that spiritual covenant by which God made choice of a church,
   that might lead on earth a heavenly life. He does not intend to include
   as among these wonders, that the sun, moon, and stars, daily rise to
   give light to the world, that the earth produces its fruit in its
   seasons, that every living creature is supplied with abundance of all
   good things for its food, and that the human family are liberally
   provided with so many conveniences; but he celebrates the sovereign
   grace of God, by which he chose for himself from amongst the lost race
   of Adam a small portion to whom he might show himself to be a father.
   Accordingly, he enjoins them to rejoice in the name of God, and to call
   upon him; a privilege by which the Church alone is distinguished.
   Whence it follows, that this language is addressed to none but true
   believers, whom God would have to glory in his name, since he has taken
   them under his special protection.

   4 Seek ye Jehovah, and his strength [204] Although he had in the
   preceding verse characterized the faithful by the honorable
   designation, those who seek God, yet he again exhorts them to
   earnestness in seeking him, which is not an unnecessary exhortation.
   Seeking God, it is true, is the mark by which all genuine saints are
   particularly distinguished from the men of the world; but they come far
   short of seeking him with due ardor; and, accordingly, they have always
   need of incitements, to urge them on to this exercise, although they
   run of their own accord. Those whom the prophet here stirs up to seek
   God are not fickle persons, nor such as are altogether indolent, and
   who cleave to the impurities of earth, but those who with a prompt and
   ready mind already aim at doing this; and he thus stimulates them,
   because he perceives that they are obstructed by many impediments from
   advancing in their course with sufficient rapidity. However willing
   then we may be, we have notwithstanding, need of such incitement to
   correct our slowness. The strength and face of God, doubtless refer to
   that kind of manifestation by which God, accommodating himself to the
   rudeness of the times, drew at that time true believers to himself. The
   ark of the covenant is in many other places called both the strength
   and the face of God, because by that symbol the people were reminded,
   that he was near them, and also really experienced his power. [205] The
   more familiarly then God showed himself to them, with the more
   promptitude and alacrity would the prophet have them to apply their
   hearts in seeking him; and the aid by which God relieves our weakness
   should prove an additional stimulus to our zeal. Modesty also is
   recommended to us, that, mindful of our slowness in seeking God, we may
   keep the way which he has prescribed to us, and may not despise the
   rudiments through which he by little and little conducts us to himself.
   It is added continually, that no person may grow weary in this
   exercise, or, inflated with a foolish opinion of having reached
   perfection, may neglect the external aids of piety, as is done by many,
   who, after having advanced a few degrees in the knowledge of God,
   exempt themselves from the common rank of others, as if they were
   elevated above the angels. Again, the injunction is given to remember
   the marvelous works which God had performed, in the deliverance of his
   people from Egypt, when he displayed his power in new and unusual ways.
   By the judgments of his mouth, some understand the law. But as I read
   all the three expressions, his marvelous works, his wonders, and the
   judgments of his mouth, as referring to one series of events, I prefer
   explaining it rather of the miracles by which God subdued the pride of
   Pharaoh. Still, however, there is some doubt as to the reason of this
   manner of speaking. Some are of opinion, that these miracles are called
   the judgments of God's mouth, because he had foretold them by Moses,
   which is highly probable. At the same time, the expression might be
   taken more simply, as denoting that the power of God was manifested in
   an extraordinary manner in these miracles; from which it would be easy
   to gather, that they were performed by him. I do not mean to exclude
   the ministry of Moses, whom God had raised up to be a prophet to the
   Egyptians, that in denouncing what was to come to pass, he might show
   that nothing happened by chance. Yet I think there is an allusion to
   the manifest character of the miracles, as if it had been said,
   Although God had not uttered a word, the facts themselves evidently
   showed, that he was the deliverer of his people.

   Psalm 105:6-11

   6. Ye seed of Abraham his servant, the sons of Jacob his chosen. 7. He
   is Jehovah our God: his judgments are through all the earth. 8. He hath
   remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a
   thousand generations; [206] 9. Which he made with Abraham; and his oath
   which he swore to Isaac; [207] 10. And established it to Jacob for a
   law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: [208] 11. Saying, I
   will give thee the land of Canaan, the cord [or measuring line [209] ]
   of your inheritance.


   6 Ye seed of Abraham his servant. The Psalmist addresses himself by
   name to his own countrymen, whom, as has been stated, God had bound to
   himself by a special adoption. It was a bond of union still more
   sacred, that by the mere good pleasure of God they were preferred to
   all other nations. By calling them the seed of Abraham, and the sons of
   Jacob, he reminds them that they had not attained so great dignity by
   their own power, but because they were descended from the holy fathers.
   He, however, affirms at the same time, that the holiness of their
   fathers flowed exclusively from God's election, and not from their own
   nature. He expressly states both these truths, first, that before they
   were born children of Abraham, they were already heirs of the covenant,
   because they derived their origin from the holy fathers; and, secondly,
   that the fathers themselves had not acquired this prerogative by their
   own merit or worth, but had been freely chosen; for this is the reason
   why Jacob is called God's chosen Although Abraham is also here called
   God's servant, (Genesis 26:24) because he purely and sincerely
   worshipped him, yet in the second clause it is testified that the
   commencement of this distinction was not to be traced to men, but to
   God alone, who conferred upon the Israelites the honor of choosing them
   to be his peculiar possession.

   From this covenant the Psalmist infers that although the government of
   God extends through the whole world, and although he executes his
   judgment in all places, he was nevertheless especially the God of that
   one people, (verse 7) according to the statement in the song of Moses,

   "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he
   separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people, according
   to the number of the children of Israel: For the Lord's portion is his
   people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance." Deuteronomy 32:8, 9

   The prophet again intended to show that the reason why the children of
   Israel excelled others was not because they were better than others,
   but because such was the good pleasure of God. If the divine judgments
   are extended through all the regions of the globe, the condition of all
   nations is in this respect equal. Whence it follows that the difference
   referred to proceeded from the love of God, -- that the source of the
   superiority of the Israelites to other nations was his free favor.
   Although, then, He is the rightful proprietor of the whole earth, it is
   declared that he chose one people over whom he might reign. This is a
   doctrine which applies to us also at the present day. If we duly ponder
   our calling, we will undoubtedly find that God has not been induced
   from anything out of himself to prefer us to others, but that he was
   pleased to do so purely from his own free grace.

   8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever The Psalmist now celebrates
   the effect and actual fulfillment of the covenant, and proves from the
   deliverance wrought for the Israelites what he had stated before,
   namely, That God, while he reigned alike over all nations, extended his
   peculiar favor to the offspring of Abraham alone. How comes it to pass
   that God, in delivering his people, displayed the might of his arm by
   so many miracles, if it was not that he might faithfully perform the
   promise which he had made to his servants in time past? It is evident,
   then, that the ancient covenant was the cause of the deliverance
   granted to the chosen tribes; for in order that God might faithfully
   keep his promises, it behooved him first to be merciful. As a long
   series of years had elapsed between the promise and the performance,
   the prophet uses the word remember, intimating that the Divine promises
   do not become obsolete by length of time, but that even when the world
   imagines that they are extinguished and wholly forgotten, God retains
   as distinct a remembrance of them as ever, that he may accomplish them
   in due season. This is more strongly confirmed in the next clause,
   where the correspondence between the form or tenor of the covenant and
   the accomplishment is celebrated. It is not for a day, he would say, or
   for a few days, that God has made a covenant with Abraham, nor has he
   limited the continuance of his covenant to the life of man, but he has
   promised to be the God of his seed even to a thousand generations.
   Although, therefore, the fulfillment was for a long time suspended, God
   nevertheless showed by the effect that his promise did not fail by
   length of time.

   As Abraham was the first who was called when he was mingled with
   idolaters, the prophet begins with him. He, however, afterwards
   declares that the covenant was also confirmed in the hand of his son
   and his son's son. God then deposited his covenant with Abraham, and by
   solemn oath engaged to be the God of his seed. But to give greater
   assurance of the truth of his promise, he was graciously pleased to
   renew it to Isaac and Jacob. The effect of such an extension of it is,
   that his faithfulness takes deeper hold on the hearts of men; and,
   besides, his grace, when it is thus testified on frequent recurring
   occasions, becomes better known and more illustrious among men.
   Accordingly, it is here declared by gradation how steadfast and
   immovable this covenant is; for what is affirmed concerning each of the
   patriarchs belongs equally to them all. It is said that God swore to
   Isaac. But had he not sworn to Abraham before? Undoubtedly he had. It
   is also said that it was established to Jacob for a law, and for an
   everlasting covenant Does this mean that the covenant was previously
   only temporal and transitory, and that then it had changed its nature?
   Such an idea is altogether at variance with the meaning of the sacred
   writer. By these different forms of expression he asserts that the
   covenant was fully and perfectly confirmed, so that, if perhaps the
   calling was obscure in one man, it might be more evident, by God's
   having transmitted the testimony of it to posterity; for by this means
   the truth of it was the better manifested. Here again we must remember
   that God with great kindness considers our weakness when, both by his
   oath, and by frequently repeating his word, he ratifies what he has
   once promised to us. Our ingratitude then appears the fouler in
   disbelieving him when he not only speaks but also swears.

   11. Saying, I will give thee the land of Canaan As this was only a
   small portion of the blessings offered to the fathers, the prophet
   seems at first view too much to limit the covenant of God, which
   extended even to the hope of an eternal inheritance. But he considered
   it enough to show, by the figure synecdoche, that a part of what God
   had promised to the fathers had received its complete accomplishment.
   His drift is to intimate that they did not possess the land of Canaan
   by any other right than because it was the legitimate inheritance of
   Abraham according to the covenant which God had made with him. If man
   exhibit the promised earnest of a contract, he does not violate the
   contract. When, therefore, the prophet proves by a visible symbol that
   God did not make a covenant with his servants in vain, and that he did
   not disappoint their hope, he does not take away or abolish the other
   blessings included in it. Nay, rather, when the Israelites heard that
   they possessed the land of Canaan by right of inheritance, because they
   were the chosen people of God, it became them to look beyond this, and
   to take comprehensive view of all the privileges by which He had
   vouchsafed to distinguish them. Hence it is to be noted, that when He
   in part fulfills his promises towards us, we are base and ungrateful if
   this experience does not conduce to the confirmation of our faith.
   Whenever he shows himself to be a father towards us, he undoubtedly
   really seals on our hearts the power and efficacy of his word. But if
   the land of Canaan ought to have led the children of Israel in their
   contemplations to heaven, since they knew that they had been brought
   into it on account of the covenant which God had made with them, the
   consideration that He has given to us his Christ, "in whom all the
   promises are yea and amen," (2 Corinthians 1:20) ought to have much
   greater weight with us. When it is said, I will give thee the measuring
   line of Your inheritance, the change of the number points out that God
   made a covenant with all the people in general, though he spake the
   words only to a few individuals; even as we have seen a little before
   that it was a decree or an everlasting law. The holy patriarchs were
   the first and principal persons into whose hands the promise was
   committed; but they did not embrace the grace which was offered to them
   as what belonged only to themselves, but as what their posterity in
   common with them were to became sharers of.

   [208] To Jacob also he renewed at Beersheba all the gracious assurances
   of the covenant which he had made with Abraham, and ratified to Isaac,
   (Genesis 28:10-15;) and he again renewed them at Padan-aram, (Genesis
   35:9-15; 13:1-5,) when he changed his name from Jacob to Israel.

   [209] In our English version it is lot. But the original word signifies
   a cord or line. There is here an illusion to the several lots or
   portions into which the land of Canaan was divided among the twelve
   tribes; which were measured by lines. See [12]volume 1, page 225, note
   4. It being thought by some learned men that the descendants of Heber
   possessed the land of Canaan before the Canaanites, and that the latter
   unjustly dispossessed them, (see [13]volume 3, page 264, note 3;)
   Dimock supposes that the phrase, "the lot of your inheritance," refers
   to this prior and rightful possession. But the appellation given them
   in verse 12th, as strangers in it, seems to militate against such an
   opinion. Nor is it necessary for vindicating God to have recourse to
   such a supposition. As he is the supreme proprietor of all the earth,
   he has a right to give it to whomsoever he pleases; and the wickedness
   of the Canaanites sufficiently justified their expulsion.

   Psalm 105:12-15

   12. When they were but very few in number; and strangers in it. 13. And
   walked about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another
   people. 14. He did not suffer men to hurt them; and rebuked kings for
   their sake; 15. Saying, Touch not my anointed ones, and do my prophets
   no wrong. [210]


   12. When they were but very few in number The prophet here recounts the
   benefits which God had conferred upon the holy fathers from the
   commencement, to manifest that even long before the deliverance from
   Egypt, the covenant was not ineffectual. The great object aimed at in
   this recital, is to show that ever since God took Abraham under his
   protection, he cherished him in a wonderful manner, and also that his
   fatherly love and care were displayed in maintaining and defending the
   other two patriarchs. When it is said, that they were but very few in
   number, the power of God by this circumstance is not only magnified,
   but the cause why he was so beneficent towards them is also pointed
   out. We must then, in the first place, attend to this, that the
   prophet, lest the Jews should arrogate anything to themselves,
   expressly declares, that their fathers had experienced the divine
   favor, even when they were feeble and despised, wandering from place to
   place, in every respect poor and miserable according to the flesh. Thus
   also Moses reproaches them,

   "The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye
   were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all
   people; but because the Lord loved you." Deuteronomy 7:7, 8,

   In short, in the choosing of this people, no regard was had either to
   number, or to any excellence whatever. There was only the house of
   Abraham, and yet it was barren. Isaac was compelled to banish to a
   distance from him one of his two sons, and he saw the other cut off
   from his family. The house of Jacob was indeed more fruitful, but it
   was nevertheless of a low condition. Besides, they were not only
   ignoble and despised when sojourning in a strange land, but famine, and
   the want of other things also, compelled them frequently to go from one
   place to another. All these things being taken into view, the
   consideration of human worth falls to the ground, and it is clearly
   seen, that all the blessings which God had bestowed upon them flowed
   from no other fountain than his own free love. And the cause of this
   love is not to be sought for out of himself. If the Holy Spirit is so
   careful in magnifying the grace of God in these earthly blessings, how
   much more must he observe this rule, when the subject of which he
   speaks is the heavenly inheritance! When it is said, that they walked
   about from nation to nation, this intimates the more plainly how
   wonderfully the divine protection was displayed in preserving them. Had
   they found any quiet nest in which to repose, such comfort would have
   been a notable sign of the divine goodness; but when they were as
   exiles in divers countries, and were driven from one place to another
   with bitter scorn, as chaff is driven about by the wind, the
   guardianship which God exercised over them shone forth much more
   conspicuously. Since their life everywhere hung only by a thread, and
   the changing of their place of sojourn exposed them from time to time
   to fresh injuries, it is evident that it was the divine power alone
   which preserved them in safety.

   14. He did not suffer men to hurt them Abraham and his children had not
   merely two or three enemies: they were harassed by whole nations. As
   then many rose up one after another in troops against them, the
   Psalmist says indefinitely, that men were withheld from hurting them;
   for 'dm, adam, is the word here used, which is the one most generally
   employed to signify man He next amplifies the love of God towards his
   servants, in setting himself in opposition to kings for their sake.
   When God did not spare even the kings of Egypt and Gerar, it is evident
   how precious the welfare of Abraham and his offspring was in his sight.
   We have said a little before that the holy fathers were of no
   estimation in the eyes of the world. God therefore displayed his
   goodness so much the more signally in preferring them to kings. Now we
   here see, that the Jews were humbled in the person of their fathers,
   that they might not imagine that they found favor in the sight of God
   by any merit of their own.

   15. Saying, Touch not my anointed ones The Psalmist proceeds farther,
   affirming, that when God made war against kings for the sake of his
   servants, they were defended by him, not only as he is accustomed to
   succor the miserable and the unjustly oppressed, but because he had
   taken them under his special guardianship. God protects his people, not
   only upon a general ground, but because he has declared on account of
   his free adoption, that he will maintain them. This is the reason why
   these holy patriarchs are here honored with two designations, his
   prophets and his anointed ones In speaking of other men, God would have
   said, Touch not these men who have done wrong to nobody, hurt not these
   poor wretched creatures who have deserved no such treatment at your
   hands. But in the person of Abraham and his children, he shows that
   there was another reason for his defending them. He calls them anointed
   ones, because he had set them apart to be his peculiar people. In the
   same sense, he designates them prophets, (a title with which Abraham is
   also honored, Genesis 20:7) not only because God had manifested himself
   more intimately to them, but also because they faithfully spread around
   them divine truth, that the memory of it might survive them, and
   flourish after their death. Anointing, it is true, was not as yet in
   use, as it was afterwards under the law; but the prophet teaches, that
   what God at a subsequent period exhibited in the ceremonies of the law
   was really and in very deed in Abraham, even as God engraves the mark
   of sanctification on all his chosen ones. If God's inward anointing was
   of such powerful efficacy, even at the time when he had not yet
   appointed, or delivered the figures of the law, with how much greater
   care will he defend his servants now, after having exhibited to us the
   plenitude of anointing in his only begotten Son!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [210] Dr Morison explains the 13th, 14th, and 15th verses thus: --
   "When they went from one part of Canaan to another, which they found
   possessed by seven great nations, (Genesis 7:1;) when they were driven
   from one kingdom to another people, -- sometimes in Egypt, (Genesis
   12:10) sometimes in Gerar, (Genesis 20:1; 26,) and sometimes in the
   country of the East, from whence they came, (Genesis 29:1,) he suffered
   no one to injure them; on the contrary, he raised up friends for them,
   (Genesis 31:24, 42,) rebuked the kings of Egypt (Genesis 12:16, 17) and
   Gerar (Genesis 20:3) for their sakes, and counseled them in the most
   solemn terms not to touch or injure the persons of his anointed
   servants, (Genesis 26:11, 29,) by whom, that is by Abraham, Isaac, and
   Jacob, the Most High communicated his will to his Church, pouring his
   Spirit upon them, and making them kings and priests in the
   distinguished families to which they belonged."

   Psalm 105:16-19

   16. And he called a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of
   bread. 17. He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a slave. 18.
   They afflicted his feet in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul.
   19. Until the time that his word came: the word of Jehovah tried him.


   16. And he called a famine upon the land Here the inspired writer
   recounts a most illustrious proof of divine providence towards the
   chosen people, at the time when the covenant might seem to be void and
   disannulled. The inheritance of the land of Canaan (as has been stated
   above) was added, as an earnest or pledge for confirmation. The descent
   of Jacob into Egypt, which deprived his house of the sight of the land,
   could not make the covenant to perish. In this the constancy of God
   shone forth the brighter; yea, by this trial he manifested more plainly
   how provident a father he was in preserving the seed of Abraham. But it
   is better to consider each particular in the verse. In the first place,
   it is taught, that the famine which drove Jacob into Egypt did not
   happen by chance. Although only one particular famine is here treated
   of, it is to be held as a general principle, that there is no other
   cause of any scarcity of sustenance except this, that God, in
   withdrawing his hand, takes away the means of support. The curse of God
   is expressed more emphatically, when it is said, that the famine was
   called; as if it were ready at his command, as a minister of his wrath.
   By this we are instructed, that famine, pestilence, and other scourges
   of God, do not visit men by chance, but are directed by his hand
   whither it pleases him, and are obedient to his will. [211] The manner
   in which the famine was called is next stated, namely, when he brake
   the staff of bread The metaphor of staff is very appropriate; for God
   has put into bread the power and property of strengthening man, by a
   secret virtue which fits it to sustain us. So long as it pleases him to
   nourish us by such means, a staff as it were lies hidden within it.
   This staff is broken in two ways; either, first, when he takes away the
   supply of grain necessary for our nourishment, the sense in which it
   seems to be used in Ezekiel

   "Moreover, he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff
   of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight, and with
   care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment;"
   Ezekiel 4:16

   or, secondly, when he breathes in anger upon the bread itself, so that
   those who would satisfy themselves by devouring it, instead of having
   their hunger thereby removed, remain famished still. And certainly to
   the barrenness of the earth this second is commonly added, namely, that
   he takes away the sustaining power which is in bread; for, as it is
   declared in Deuteronomy 8:3, bread does not give life of itself, but
   borrows its secret virtue from the mouth of God.

   17. He sent a man before them This whole passage graphically teaches
   us, that whatever befell that people was by the hand and counsel of
   God. The simple recital would have been to say, that the famine came
   upon the land, after Joseph had been sold by his brethren, and carried
   into Egypt. But the prophet speaks emphatically, declaring that Joseph
   by the divine counsel had been sent before into Egypt, to support his
   father's house, that afterwards the famine was called, and that then,
   by God's providence, a remedy was presented beyond all hope. This,
   indeed, is generally true in human affairs; but there is here
   commemorated a special care which God took in governing and nourishing
   his Church. Moreover, the prophet mentions that as second in place
   which was first in the order of time. Accordingly, in regard to the
   word send, the pluperfect tense would better express the sense, he had
   sent; implying that before God afflicted the land of Canaan with
   famine, he had prepared a remedy for his servant Jacob, and for his
   household, in having sent Joseph before as a steward to provide them
   with food. Here two contraries as it were are stated, to render the
   divine superintendence in the whole the more conspicuous. How was
   Joseph sent of God? It was in this way:- When he was doomed to death,
   it happened that his brethren preferred selling him to leaving him in
   his grave. This selling, if considered merely by itself, like a cloud
   interposed, obscured and concealed the divine providence. When counsel
   was taken to put Joseph to death, who would have expected that he was
   to be the sustainer of his father's house? Afterwards a kind of death
   was devised for him less cruel; but then he was cast into a well or
   pit, and in that situation how could he succor others? The last hope
   was, that at length being sold, he came forth from the pit. But again,
   he was well nigh rotting all his life long in prison.

   Who could think that processes so intricate and circuitous were
   controlled by divine providence? The prophet therefore meets this
   difficulty by saying, that in respect of men, he was indeed sold; but
   that he had nevertheless been previously sent by the divine purpose.
   The passage is worthy of notice, admirably vindicating, as it does, the
   providence of God against the perverse stupidity of our corrupt nature.
   Resting on the second causes which meet the eye, or ascribing to the
   direction of man whatever is done in this world, or thinking that all
   things happen by chance, very few trace them to the appointment of God.
   And yet the selling of Joseph is not here interposed as a veil to hide
   divine providence; but is rather set forth as a signal instance of it
   to teach us that whatever men may undertake, the issues are in the hand
   of God; or rather, that by a secret influence, he bends the hearts of
   men in whatever direction he pleases, that by their instrumentality,
   whether they will or no, he may bring to pass what he has determined
   should be done. Agreeably to this Joseph said to his brethren, "Now,
   therefore, be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me
   hither; for God did send me before you to preserve life," (Genesis
   45:5) Farther, God so governs human affairs by his secret controlling
   influence, and overrules men's wicked devices to a right end, as that
   his judgments are notwithstanding uncontaminated by the depravity of
   men. The brethren of Joseph wickedly conspire his death; they also
   wrongfully sell him: the fault is in themselves. Contemplate now how
   God directs and controls all. By the hand of these brethren he provides
   for the good both of themselves and of their father Jacob, yea for that
   of the whole Church. This holy purpose contracts no defilement or spot
   from the malice of those who aimed at an entirely opposite end; even as
   Joseph testified afterwards,

   "But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto
   good, to bring to pass as it is this day, to save much people alive,"
   (Genesis 1:20)

   18 They afflicted his feet in the fetters It is not without cause that
   the Psalmist prosecutes the winding course of Jacob's early history,
   which might so confuse the minds of men as to prevent them from
   directing their attention to the counsel of God. What seemed less
   likely than to believe that God, by so directly opposite and circuitous
   a path, meant to accomplish what he had purposed? But his providence,
   by surmounting so many obstacles, is brought out more conspicuously,
   than if he had despatched the whole matter by a short and easy road.
   Had Joseph, as soon as he arrived in Egypt, been presented to the king,
   and made its governor, the way to what followed would have been easy.
   But when he was carried away to prison, and lay there separated from
   the society of men, living as one half-dead; and when his becoming
   known to the king was a long time subsequent to this, and beyond all
   expectation, such a sudden change renders the miracle much more
   evident. This circuitous course then, which the prophet recounts,
   serves not a little to illustrate the subject in hand. Joseph was many
   times dead before he was sold. Hence it follows, that God as often
   showed his care of his Church by delivering him who might be termed her
   father. When after, having been brought into Egypt, Joseph was conveyed
   from hand to hand till he descended into another grave, is it not the
   more clearly manifest from this that God, while he seems to be asleep
   in heaven, is all the while keeping the strictest watch over his
   servants, and that he is carrying forward his purpose more effectually
   by these various windings, than if he had gone straight forward, yea,
   than if he had run with rapid pace? For this reason the prophet affirms
   that his feet were afflicted in the fetters; a fact which, although not
   stated in the narrative of Moses, he speaks of as well known. And no
   doubt, many things were delivered by tradition to the Jews of which no
   mention is made in the Scriptures. [212] It is also probable enough,
   that, instead of being put at first under mild restraint, as was
   afterwards the case, he was rigorously confined. Whether we read, his
   soul entered into the iron, or the iron entered into his soul, [213]
   the meaning, which, in either case, is exactly the same, amounts to
   this, that the holy man was so galled with fetters, that it seemed as
   if his life had been given over to the sword. Whence it follows, that
   the safety of his life was as hopeless as the restoration of life to a
   dead body.

   19. Until the time that his word came Here the prophet teaches, that
   although, according to the judgment of the flesh, God seems to be too
   tardy in his steps, yet he holds supreme rule over all things, that he
   may at length accomplish in due time what he has determined. As to the
   term word, it is here doubtless to be taken, not for doctrine or
   instruction, but for a heavenly decree. The relative his admits of
   being understood as well of God himself as of Joseph; but its
   application to the latter appears to me to be preferable, implying that
   Joseph remained in prison until the issue of his affliction was
   manifested, which was hidden in the divine purpose. It is always to be
   kept in mind, that the prophet calls back the minds of men from that
   impious imagination, which would represent fortune as exercising a
   blind and capricious control over human affairs. Since nothing could be
   more involved in uncertainty than the welfare of the Church, whilst
   Joseph was accounted as a condemned person, the prophet here elevates
   our minds, and bids us look at the hidden word, that is, the decree,
   the proper opportunity and time for the manifestation of which had not
   yet arrived. After the same manner I explain what follows, the word of
   God tried him To expound it of Joseph's prophesying, [214] as many do,
   seems too refined. Until the happy issue appeared, which God kept long
   hidden and in suspense, Joseph's patience was severely tried. What
   worldly men, who acknowledge not God to be the Governor of human
   affairs, call fate, the prophet distinguishes by a more appropriate
   name, terming it word, and the word of each man. Nor do I see any
   impropriety in using the French word destinée. When the Stoics dispute,
   or rather babble, about destiny, they not only involve themselves and
   the thing also of which they treat in intricate mazes, but, at the same
   time, involve in perplexity an indubitable truth; for in imagining a
   concatenation of causes, they divest God of the government of the
   world. It is an impious invention so to link together causes,
   interwoven with each other, as that God himself should be tied to them.
   Our faith then ought to mount up to his secret counsel, by which,
   uncontrolled, he directs all things to their end. This passage also
   teaches us that God will continue the afflictions of the godly only
   until they are thereby thoroughly proved.

   [211] "Famine is here finely represented as a servant, ready to come
   and go at the call' and command of God; for calamities, whether public
   or private, are the messengers of divine justice." -- Horne.

   [212] The memory of this circumstance might, therefore, have been
   preserved by tradition; or it may be simply a conclusion drawn from
   Joseph's being incarcerated, and from the crime of which he was
   accused. When it is considered that prisoners were ordinarily secured
   by chains, and when the magnitude of the crime charged upon him, that
   of making an attempt upon the chastity of his mistress, is farther
   taken into account, it is a very probable inference, that when cast
   into prison, he was put in chains.

   [213] The first of these readings is the most probable. The Hebrew is
   vrzl v'h nphsv. "The verb being here in the feminine gender shows that
   the subject is nphsv, and that vrzl is accusative. In this manner the
   phrase is rendered by the LXX. Sideron diolthen he psuche autou, his
   soul passed through iron;' and so the Syriac, his soul went into iron;'
   but the Chaldee, disregarding the gender, has taken it the other way,
   the chain of iron went into his soul.'" -- (Phillips' Psalms in Hebrew,
   with a Critical, Exegetical, and Philological Commentary.)

   [214] It is so understood by Dr Kennicott. He refers the first clause
   of the verse to the completion of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams
   of the chief butler and baker; an opinion which cannot be admitted, for
   Joseph was not delivered at that time, but two years after it, Genesis
   41:1. He refers the second clause to the interpretation of Pharaoh's
   dreams, called the Word or Oracle of Jehovah, because sent by him to
   Pharaoh. In this sense Hammond also interprets it. "The word of the
   Lord." says he, "is God's showing him the meaning of those dreams,
   (Genesis 41:39) God's telling him, or revealing to him, the
   interpretation of them." Some who take this view explain the verb
   tried, not as referring to the trial of Joseph's patience, but as
   referring to the proof of his innocence. "tsrph," says Street, "in its
   primary sense, signifies to refine metals, or to examine their purity
   by fire: by metaphor it is applied to the human heart, and signifies to
   purify, to prove, to examine; but as metal, already free from dross,
   would not be refined, but only show its purity on being assayed, so
   here the Word seems to signify showed him to be innocent. Joseph,
   protesting his innocence to Pharaoh's butler, says, (Genesis 40:10)
   Here also have I done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon;'
   and Pharaoh assigns it as his reason for taking him from prison, and
   setting him over the land of Egypt, (Genesis 41:38) Can ye find as this
   is a man in whom the Spirit of God is?' His interpreting, by the
   inspiration of God, their dreams, exempted him at once from being any
   longer looked on as a criminal, and raised him to the highest honors."
   "This word," says Phillips, "proved Joseph, or purified him, as the
   verb literally means, for it made him appear pure or innocent in the
   eyes of the people, who were thus assured that God was with him, and
   that he must therefore be a pious person, and not guilty of the crime
   for which he was thrown into a dungeon."

   Psalm 105:20-24

   20. The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and set
   him free. 21. He made him lord over his house; and ruler over all his
   substance: 22. To bind his princes [215] at his pleasure; and to teach
   his elders wisdom. 23. And Israel came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned
   in the land of Ham. [216] 24. And he greatly increased his people, and
   multiplied [217] them above their oppressors.


   20. The king sent and loosed him The Psalmist celebrates in high terms
   the deliverance of Joseph; for God's singular power was conspicuously
   displayed in a matter so incredible. What is of more rare occurrence
   than for a most powerful monarch to bring a stranger out of prison to
   constitute him ruler over his whole kingdom, and to raise him to a rank
   of honor, second only to himself? The phrase in verse 22, to bind his
   princes, is commonly explained as implying that Joseph was invested
   with the chief sovereignty in the administration of the government, so
   that he could cast into prison, at his pleasure, even the nobles of the
   realm. Others, conceiving this interpretation to be somewhat harsh,
   derive the verb l'svr, lesor, which Moses employs, not from 'sr, asar,
   which signifies to bind, but from ysr, yasar, which signifies to
   instruct, by changing the letter y, yod, into ', aleph. [218] But I am
   surprised that neither of them have perceived the metaphor contained in
   this word, which is, that Joseph held the lords of Egypt bound to him
   at his pleasure, or subject to his power. What is here spoken of is not
   fetters, but the bond or obligation of obedience, both the princes and
   all others being dependent on his will. The expression, which is added
   a little after, to teach his elders wisdom, evinces that Joseph did not
   bear sway like a tyrant, difficult and rare a thing as it is for men,
   when invested with sovereign power, not to give loose reins to their
   own humor: but that he was a rule and a pattern, even to the chief of
   them, in the high degree of discretion which he exemplified in the
   administering the affairs of state.

   23. And Israel came into Egypt The prophet does not rehearse the whole
   history, nor was this necessary. He only presents to our view how
   divine providence was concerned in it, which very few consider in
   reading the narrative of Moses. He accordingly declares, that after
   Joseph had been sent before into Egypt, to be the means of supporting
   his father and the whole family, Jacob then came into Egypt, that is,
   he did so when all things were admirably arranged, that he might find
   abundance of bread among a people, the proudest of the whole world,
   [219] when all others were perishing for want of food. From this it
   appears, that what is accounted to be slowness in God, tends to no
   other end than to accomplish his work on the best possible occasion.

   24. And he greatly increased his people The singular favor of God
   towards his Church is now commended by the additional circumstance,
   that within a short space of time, the chosen people increased beyond
   the common proportion. In this matter the wonderful blessing of God was
   strikingly displayed. So much the more offensive then is the barking of
   some dogs, who insolently scoff at the account given by Moses of the
   multiplying of the people, because it goes far beyond what takes place
   in the ordinary course of things. Had the people increased only at the
   common rate, these persons would have immediately objected, that
   therein no work of God was to be seen. Thus the object which they
   pursue by their cavillings is nothing else than to make it to be
   believed, that the blessing of God had no connection with the case. But
   we, who are persuaded that it is unwarrantable for us to measure God's
   power according to our own understandings, or according to what happens
   by the common law of nature, reverently admire this extraordinary work
   of his hand. The subsequent clause is a little obscure, especially if
   we read, The people were strengthened; [220] for the prophet does not
   seem to refer to that period when the Israelites lived at ease and in
   prosperity, but to the time when they were contemptuously and
   barbarously dealt with as slaves. We may, however, understand the
   language as spoken by anticipation, -- as pointing to what was to
   happen. In the following verse, it is affirmed, that the Egyptians
   having changed their mind, began to treat the people with cruelty.
   Although then the Egyptians did not as yet openly exercise their
   cruelty against the people, when they were increasing both in number
   and strength, yet the prophet calls them persecutors. It is certain,
   that the Israelites, even when they were oppressed as slaves, were a
   terror to their enemies; and Moses plainly affirms, (Exodus 1:12) that
   when they were under tyranny and wrongful oppression, it was still
   abundantly manifest, that the blessing of God rested upon them.

   Psalm 105:25-30

   25. He turned their heart, so that they hated his people, and dealt
   craftily with his servants. 26. He sent Moses his servant; Aaron whom
   he had chosen. 27. They set among them the words of his signs and his
   miracles in the land of Ham. 28. He sent darkness, and made it dark;
   and they were not rebellious against his words. 29. He turned their
   waters into blood, and killed their fish. 30. Their land brought forth
   frogs, yea, even within the chambers of their kings.


   25. He turned their heart, so that they hated his people The Egyptians,
   though at first kind and courteous hosts to the Israelites, became
   afterwards cruel enemies; and this also the prophet ascribes to the
   counsel of God. They were undoubtedly driven to this by a perverse and
   malignant spirit, by pride and covetousness; but still such a thing did
   not happen without the providence of God, who in an incomprehensible
   manner so accomplishes his work in the reprobate, as that he brings
   forth light even out of darkness. The form of expression seems to some
   a little too harsh, and therefore they translate the verb passively,
   their (i.e., the Egyptians') hearts were turned. But this is poor, and
   does not suit the context; for we see that it is the express object of
   the inspired writer to put the whole government of the Church under
   God, so that nothing may happen but according to his will. If the
   delicate ears of some are offended at such doctrine, let it be
   observed, that the Holy Spirit unequivocally affirms in other places as
   well as here, that the minds of men are driven hither and thither by a
   secret impulse, (Proverbs 21:1) so that they can neither will nor do
   any thing except as God pleases. What madness is it to embrace nothing
   but what commends itself to human reason? What authority will God's
   word have, if it is not admitted any farther than we are inclined to
   receive it? Those then who reject this doctrine, because it is not very
   grateful to the human understanding, are inflated with a perverse
   arrogance. Others malignantly misrepresent it, not through ignorance or
   by mistake, but only that they may excite commotion in the Church, or
   to bring us into odium among the ignorant. Some over-timid persons
   could wish, for the sake of peace, that this doctrine were buried. They
   are surely ill qualified for composing differences. This was the very
   cause why in former times the doctors of the Church, in their writings,
   swerved from the pure and genuine truths of the gospel, and turned
   aside to a heathen philosophy. Whence originated the doctrine of
   free-will, whence that of the righteousness of works, but because these
   good fathers were afraid of giving occasion to evil-tongued or
   malignant men if they freely professed what is contained in the sacred
   Scriptures? And had not God, as it were by a strong hand, prevented
   Augustine, he would, in this respect, have been exactly like the rest.
   But God, so to speak, polishing him with a hammer, corrected that
   foolish wisdom, which rears its crest against the Holy Spirit. The Holy
   Spirit, we see, affirms that the Egyptians were so wicked, that God
   turned their hearts to hate his people. The middle-scheme men seek to
   evade and qualify this statement, by saying, that his turning their
   hearts, denotes his permitting this; [221] or, that when the Egyptians
   set their hearts upon hating the Israelites, he made use of their
   malice, as what, so to speak, came accidentally in his way; as if the
   Holy Spirit, from being defective in the power of language, spoke one
   thing, when he meant another. If the doctrine of this text, at first
   sight, seem strange to us, let us remember that God's judgments, in
   other places, are justly called "unsearchable," (Romans 11:33) and "a
   great deep," (Psalm 36:6) Did not our capacity fail in reaching the
   height of them, they would not have that intricacy and mystery by which
   they are characterized. It is, however, to be observed, that the root
   of the malice was in the Egyptians themselves, so that the fault cannot
   be transferred to God. I say, they were spontaneously and innately
   wicked, and not forced by the instigation of another. In regard to God,
   it ought to suffice us to know, that such was his will, although the
   reason may be unknown to us. But the reason is also apparent, which
   vindicates his righteousness from every objection. If we learn and keep
   in mind only this small word of advice, That the revealed will of God
   ought to be reverently acquiesced in, we will receive, without
   disputation, those mysteries which offend either the proud, or such as
   would be over-careful to remove the difficulties, in which, according
   to their view, such mysteries seem to be involved. [222] The prophet
   next expresses the manner in which the Egyptians wrought mischief
   against the people of God: they did not assault them openly, that they
   might put them to death, but they endeavored, in the way of craft and
   policy, to oppress them by little and little. His expression is
   borrowed from Moses himself. And it is purposely used, that we may not
   think that the hearts of the ungodly are permitted without restraint to
   work our destruction. It is a consideration which ought surely to
   satisfy our minds, that whatever the devil and wicked men may plot
   against us, God nevertheless represses their attempts. But it is a
   double confirmation of our faith, when we hear that not only their
   hands are bound, but also their hearts and thoughts, so that they can
   purpose nothing except what God pleases.

   26 He sent Moses his servant Here the prophet briefly adverts to such
   things regarding the deliverance of the people as were worthy of
   particular notice. Had the Egyptians of their own accord suffered the
   people to depart, neither the service of Moses nor miracles would have
   been required. God then appointed that their deliverance should take
   place in such a way, as would render the denial of his being its author
   impossible. Moses is called the servant of the Lord, to teach us that
   he was not self-elected to his office, and that he attempted nothing by
   his own authority, but, being the minister of God, executed the office
   with which he had been intrusted. The same thing is expressed still
   more plainly with respect to Aaron, when he is said to have been chosen
   What is attributed to each of these eminent men in particular, applies
   equally to both, and therefore the sentence ought to be explained thus:
   God sent Moses and Aaron, his servants, not because of their own
   intrinsic fitness, or because they spontaneously offered to him their
   service, but because he chose them. This passage teaches us, that those
   who are engaged in active and useful service for the Church, are not
   prepared exclusively by their own exertions, or framed to it by their
   own talents, but are stirred up thereto by God. Moses was a man of
   heroic virtue: but, considered merely in himself, he was nothing.
   Accordingly, the prophet would have all that is accounted worthy of
   remembrance in Moses, as well as in Aaron, to be ascribed to God alone.
   Thus it appears that whatever men do for the welfare of the Church,
   they owe the power of doing it to God, who, of his free goodness, has
   been pleased thus to honor them.

   27. They set among them the words of his signs [223] The prophet, in
   the first place, briefly glances at those things which Moses has
   detailed at greater length. Nor does he follow the order of the events
   observed in the history; for he contents himself with showing, that the
   deliverance of the chosen people was the work of God. He again
   distinguishes between the power of God, and the ministry of Moses and
   Aaron. He indeed asserts that these men performed miracles, but these
   miracles proceeded from God, so that celestial power was not obscurely
   displayed by their instrumentality.

   In the 28th verse he specifics one of these miracles, which yet was not
   the first in order, but from which it is easy to gather that God was
   the author of the deliverance of Israel, and in which the course of
   nature was entirely changed; for nothing is more astonishing than to
   see the light turned into darkness. In the second clause, he commends
   the faithfulness of Moses and Aaron, in courageously executing whatever
   God had commanded them: And they were not rebellious against his words
   [224] There was, as if it had been said, the most perfect harmony
   between the command of God and the obedience of both his servants.

   29. He turned their waters into blood How grievous this plague was to
   the Egyptians may be conjectured from the consideration, that the
   element of water is one of the two great means of supporting life. And
   the power of God shines forth the brighter, from the fact, that
   although the land of Egypt is well irrigated, yet the Egyptians were
   parched with drought amidst abundance of water. It is afterwards said,
   that frogs were brought forth, [225] and entered even into the chambers
   of the kings; by which God manifestly evinced that he was the author of
   the miracle; for although all Egypt swarmed with frogs, the courts of
   the kings ought to have been exempt from this nuisance. By the term
   kings, is denoted either the nobles of the realm, or the king's sons,
   who were brought up in the expectation of the royal power; for at that
   time, as is well known, one king alone reigned over all Egypt. From
   this we learn how easily, and as it were by a kind of mockery, God
   humbles those who pride themselves in the flesh. He did not gather
   together an army to fight against the Egyptians, nor did he forthwith
   arm his angels, or thunder out of heaven, but brought forth frogs,
   which contemptuously trampled upon the pride of that haughty nation,
   who held in contempt the whole world beside. It would have been no
   disgrace for them to have been conquered by powerful enemies; but how
   dishonorable was it to be vanquished by frogs? God thus intended to
   show that he has no need of powerful hosts to destroy the wicked; for
   he can do this, as it were in sport, whenever he pleases.

   afterwards confirmed by miracles." -- Cresswell. "In this phrase," says
   Hammond, "the words of his signs or prodigies, dvry, words, seems to be
   somewhat more than a pleonasm. God had told them what signs they should
   use, to convince the people first, and then Pharaoh, of their mission;
   and so in each judgment God commands, and they show the sign; and God's
   thus telling or speaking to them is, properly, dvry, words, and the
   matter of these words expressed by 'tvtyv, signs or prodigies of his,
   -- viz., which as he directed, he would also enable them to do among
   them."

   [224] They executed the command of God, with respect to the plagues
   brought on the Egyptians, although they knew that in thus acting they
   would incur the heavy displeasure of Pharaoh, and expose their lives to
   considerable danger. "The import of mrv l', they resisted not," says
   Hammond, "seems no more than what is affirmed in the story, Exodus
   10:21, 22, The Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand. -- And Moses
   stretched forth his hand,' -- i.e., readily obeyed, and did what God
   directed, and that at a time when Pharaoh was likely to be incensed,
   and vehemently offended with him and Aaron. For which consideration the
   story there gives us this farther ground: for as, verse 10, he had
   before expressed some anger and threats, -- Look to it, for evil is
   before you,' and they were driven from his presence,' verse 11; so now,
   upon the hardening his heart, which follows this plague of darkness, he
   said to Moses, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no
   more, for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die the death,'
   verse 28. This rage of Pharaoh, Moses in reason might well foresee, but
   he dreaded it not; but boldly did as God directed, and that is the
   meaning of "they resisted not God's word.'"

   [225] The Hebrew verb for brought forth is srph, sharats, which
   signifies to multiply exceedingly; and "the noun is used for creeping
   things, because they procreate in great abundance. It cannot therefore
   be more fitly translated, as is observed by Hammond, than by swarming."
   -- Phillips.

   Psalm 105:31-38

   31. He spake, and there came a swarm of flies, [226] and lice [227] in
   all their borders. 32. He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire
   upon their land. 33. And he smote their vines and their fig trees; and
   destroyed the trees throughout their borders. 34. He spake, and the
   grasshopper came, and the caterpillar [228] without number, 35. And
   they devoured all the herbage in their land, and consumed the fruit of
   their ground. 36. And he smote all the first-born in their country,
   even the beginning of all their strength. [229] 37. And he brought them
   forth with silver and gold: nor was there a feeble person among his
   tribes. 38. Egypt rejoiced at their departure: for their terror had
   fallen upon them.


   31. He spake, and there came a swarm of flies By the word spake the
   Psalmist intimates that the flies and lice came not forth by chance.
   The command, we know, was uttered by the mouth of Moses; for although
   God could have given the command himself, he interposed Moses as his
   herald. God, however, gave no less efficacy to his word, when he
   commanded it to be uttered by a man, than if he himself had thundered
   from heaven. When the minister executes his commission faithfully, by
   speaking only what God puts into his mouth, the inward power of the
   Holy Spirit is joined with his outward voice. Here again it is to be
   observed, that the Egyptians were afflicted with the plague of the
   flies and lice, that God, with the greater ignominy, might subdue their
   rebellion and obstinacy. When it is said, that he gave them hail for
   rain, it denotes a hail of such appalling violence, that it could not
   be attributed to natural causes. It is probable that Egypt is not so
   subject to this annoyance as other countries, and it is very seldom
   visited even with rain, being watered with the Nile. This made it
   appear to the Egyptians the more wonderful that their country was
   stricken with hail. To render this calamity the more dreadful, God also
   mingled with it fire. The hail, then, was accompanied with a
   tempestuous whirlwind, that the Egyptians who had hardened themselves
   against the other miracles, inspired with terror, might know that they
   had to deal with God.

   34. He spake, and the grasshopper came This calamity, which was brought
   upon the fields, could not be attributed to Fortune; for the
   grasshoppers made their appearance suddenly and in countless
   multitudes, so that they covered all the land of Egypt. The miracle was
   very evident from the word spoken, by which it was introduced. Its
   being announced as to happen, removed all doubt of its being the work
   of the Most High. Accordingly, it is expressly said, that grasshoppers
   and caterpillars rushed in at the commandment of God, as if soldiers
   should run to battle at the sound of the trumpet. Whenever these
   insects molest us and destroy the fruits of the earth, they are
   assuredly the scourges of God, but it is here intended to point out an
   extraordinary work of his hand. In fine, the prophet recites the last
   miracle, which was wrought by the angel on the night previous to the
   departure of the people, when he slew all the first-born throughout
   Egypt. I only take a hasty and passing glance at this history, as I
   have, in like manner, done of the other facts preceding, because they
   have been more copiously treated elsewhere, and at this time it is
   sufficient for us to know the design of the sacred writer. He, however,
   amplifies this display of the Divine power by a repetition, declaring
   that the first-born and the flower of their strength were destroyed
   Some translate, but unhappily, The beginning of their sorrow. As man's
   strength shows itself in generation, the Hebrews term the
   first-begotten the beginning of strength, as we have [14]explained on
   Genesis 49:3, --

   "Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might,
   and the beginning of my strength."

   37. And he brought them forth with silver and gold [230] The prophet,
   on the other hand, celebrates the grace of God which preserved the
   chosen people untouched and safe from all these plagues. If both
   parties had been indiscriminately afflicted with them, the hand of God
   would not have been so signally manifest. But now when the Israelites,
   amidst so many calamities, experienced an entire exemption from harm,
   this difference exhibits to us, as in a picture, God's fatherly care
   about his own people. For this reason, it is stated, Nor was there a
   feeble person, or one who stumbled; [231] for the verb ksl, kashal, has
   both these meanings. But I prefer taking it simply in this sense, That
   whilst Egypt was hastening to destruction, the people of God were
   vigorous, and free from every malady. When it is said, He brought them
   forth, and when it is afterwards added, in his tribes, there is a
   change of the number, which is quite common in the Hebrew language.
   Some refer the word his to God; but this I am afraid is too forced.

   38. Egypt rejoiced at their departure The Psalmist sets forth the power
   of God from the additional circumstance, that the Egyptians willingly
   allowed the chosen people to depart, when yet nothing was farther from
   their intention. Although they wished them destroyed a hundred times,
   yet they thought that they had the wolf by the ears, as we say; [232]
   and thus the fear of revenge made them more determined to blot out the
   memory of that people. Whence it follows, that when they all at once
   laid aside their former purpose, it was a secret work of divine
   providence. [233] To the same effect is the statement in the preceding
   verse, that they were brought forth with gold and silver The Egyptians
   could never have had the heart voluntarily to strip themselves, to
   enrich those whom they would have willingly deprived of life. This was
   then the bounty of God, in whose hand, and at whose disposal, are all
   the riches of the world. He might have taken by force from the
   Egyptians what he had given them; but he bowed their hearts, so that of
   their own accord they denuded themselves. The expression, for their
   terror had fallen upon them, is to be understood passively; for the
   Israelites were not afraid of the Egyptians, but, on the contrary, were
   terrible to them. Nor does the prophet speak of an ordinary fear. A
   little before fear had stirred them up to cruelty and tyranny; but as
   even to that day, they had endeavored, with indomitable audacity, to
   shake off all fear, God suddenly laid them prostrate by the
   extraordinary terror which fell upon them. It is, therefore, here
   justly reckoned among the displays of the wonderful power of God, that
   he subdued the impetuous fury with which the Egyptians boiled before,
   that they might allow those to depart free, whom they had determined to
   handle rudely, and to waste in servile employments; which was like
   rendering sheep terrible to wolves.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [226] The original word for a swarm of flies is rv, arob. For some
   account of the noxious insects here meant, see [15]volume 3, page 258,
   note 2.

   [227] The Hebrew word for lice is knym, kannim. The reading in the
   Septuagint is skniphes, and in the Vulgate sciniphes, which signifies a
   species of little gnats that sting painfully in the marshy country of
   Egypt; the culex reptans of Linnaeus, or the culex molestus of Forskal.
   In support of the accuracy of this interpretation it has been said,
   that as the translators of the Septuagint dwelt in Egypt, it can hardly
   be supposed that they were ignorant of what was intended by the Hebrew
   name. Philo, an Alexandrian Jew, and Origen, a Christian father, who
   likewise lived at Alexandria, have also been produced as confirming
   this interpretation. Both Philo and Origen represent these insects as
   being very small, but very troublesome. The latter describes them as
   winged insects, but so small as to escape any but the acutest sight;
   and says, that when settled on the body, they wound it with a most
   sharp and painful piercer. Jerome also supports this view, while
   Gesenius, Boothroyd, and others, concur in it. The Jewish interpreters,
   however, and Josephus, understand the original word as denoting lice;
   which has been adopted by the translators of our English Bible, and
   which Bochart likewise follows, with most of the modern commentators.
   Bochart argues that gnats could not be intended: -- 1. Because the
   creatures here mentioned sprang from the dust of the earth, and not
   from the waters. 2. Because they were both on men and cattle, which
   cannot be spoken of gnats. 3. Because their name comes from a root
   which signifies to make firm, fix, establish, which could not apply to
   gnats, flies, etc., as they are almost constantly on the wing. 4.
   Because knh, kinah, is the term given by the Talmudists for louse. The
   translation given by Calvin, and in our English Bible, appears the most
   correct, but whichever we adopt, it is necessary to conclude (which the
   history expressly states) that the creatures were brought in swarms,
   most extraordinary even for Egypt, and thus a miraculous interposition
   was made manifest. This judgment was the more noisome and disgraceful
   to the Egyptians, from the great external purity which they affected,
   and from their being very nice both in their persons and clothing;
   bathing and making ablutions continually. They were particularly
   solicitous not to harbour any vermin, thinking it would be a great
   profanation of the temple which they entered, if any animalculae of
   this sort were concealed in their garments.

   [228] The Hebrew word translated caterpillar is ylq, yelek. This word
   is in our English Bible rendered caterpillar here, and in Jeremiah
   51:27; but in Joel 1:4, 2:25, and Nahum 3:15, it is rendered
   cankerworm. In the passage in Nahum the creature is spoken of as winged
   and bristled, whence some commentators suppose that a kind of locust is
   intended. "It certainly means some insect remarkable for destroying
   vegetables, probably the chafer' or maybug,' brouchos, as the LXX.
   render it in five passages out of eight wherein it occurs. The Vulgate
   throughout renders it bruchus, the chafer.' Michaelis thinks it means
   the chafer,' particularly in its vermicular state, when it is much more
   destructive to plants, namely, by gnawing, eating, and cankering their
   roots, than after it has taken wing." -- Parkhurst's Lexicon on ylq,
   under lq, 2.

   [229] The beginning, or the first-fruit of all their strength, is
   understood by Lowth to mean the first-born of the mother. His note on
   the verse in Merrick's Annotations is as follows: -- "Aparchen ponou,
   Primitias laboris vel partus LXX. Vulg. Hieron. Compare Genesis 35:18.
   This, I think, is the right translation. The first-born, that were
   slain on this occasion, were those that opened the womb; the first-born
   of the mother, not of the father, as it appears from the circumstances
   of the history." The first-born of cattle is no doubt also intended. --
   See Genesis 49:3; and Psalm 78:51

   [230] Allusion is made to the Israelites carrying with them in their
   departure from Egypt, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, which they
   borrowed of the Egyptians, Exodus 12:36.

   [231] "And there was not any one stumbling among his tribes. The LXX.
   have rendered kvsl by asthenes infirm, so that they understood the
   Psalmist to say, there was no one incapable of following the multitude,
   -- no one was prevented by disease or infirmity from accomplishing the
   journey." -- Phillips. What a striking contrast between their condition
   and that of their oppressors! While in every Egyptian dwelling, death
   had left his victim, not one of all the children of Israel was unable
   to prosecute his heaven-directed flight from that land of bondage.

   [232] The meaning of this proverb is to be in danger, or hard set on
   every side; for if you hold the wolf, he bites you by the fingers; if
   you let him go, he may destroy you.

   [233] From the heavy and overwhelming judgments inflicted upon Pharaoh
   and his people, for refusing to allow the Israelites to depart, they
   came to associate the presence of that people in their land, with the
   most terrible manifestations of divine displeasure. This at last led
   them, after all their inveterate impenitence, to hail with gratitude
   the departure of the hated tribes.

   Psalm 105:39-43

   39. He spread out a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light during
   the night. 40. He asked, [234] and he brought quails, and filled them
   with the bread of heaven. 41. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed
   out; they ran in the dry places like a river. 42. For he remembered his
   holy promise, which he had spoken to Abraham his servant. 43. And he
   brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness.


   39. He spread out a cloud for a covering The Psalmist enumerates
   certain miracles by which God continued his grace towards his people in
   the wilderness. This order is worthy of notice; for it was no small
   confirmation which was added to that incomparable work of redemption,
   when God ceased not to show himself the guide of their journey.
   Accordingly, after they had passed through the Red Sea, he spread a
   cloud over them by day to protect them from the heat of the sun; and
   during the night, he gave them light by a pillar of fire, that even in
   the midst of the darkness they might have a bright token of his
   presence. This continued display of his goodness was surely an
   unquestionable proof of his perpetual love, an open demonstration that
   he had adopted the children of Abraham, to foster them under his
   protection even to the end. What follows concerning quails, is
   introduced for a different purpose than that for which reference is
   made to the same fact in Psalm 78:26. In that passage, God's bringing
   in an abundance of quails is ascribed rather to his wrath than to his
   beneficence, that the people might satiate the flesh; and we have seen
   in the exposition of that place, that this is mentioned as a matter of
   reproach to them. But in the text before us, passing over their
   ingratitude, the prophet celebrates the unremitting exercise of the
   divine loving-kindness towards them. Some, however, may be rather
   inclined to take the word ask in a bad sense, because the people
   besought not God with humility, [235] but through their impatience
   proceeded at once to murmuring, or rather arrogantly spake against him.
   Thus taken, the passage, by way of amplification, would mean that God,
   departing from his own right, humoured even their unhallowed lust. As,
   however, their fault is not here mentioned, let us rest in that meaning
   which is the most simple, namely, that the blessings by which God
   ratified the redemption which he had wrought are here clustered
   together. It next follows, that they were filled with the bread of
   heaven This appellation, as we have seen elsewhere, is given to the
   manna by way of eminence. The natural way in which the food which we
   eat is obtained is from the ground; but God then opened his hand more
   widely to the Jews, and fed them even from heaven. As it was not enough
   for them to be refreshed with food when they were hungry, unless they
   were also supplied with drink, it is added, that the rock was opened,
   and that the waters flowed from it through the dry places, or the
   desert.

   42. For he remembered his holy promise The Psalmist again mentions the
   cause why God dealt so graciously with that people, and sustained them
   so tenderly, namely, that he might fulfill his promise; for he had
   entered into a covenant with Abraham, engaging to be the God of his
   seed. Nor did the prophets without cause teach so carefully as we find
   them doing, that the free covenant is the fountain whence the
   deliverance, and the continual welfare of the people flowed. Thereby
   the grace of God became better known, since what took place, so far
   from happening upon the sudden, and without anticipation, was only the
   fulfillment of what he had promised four hundred years before. God
   then, for ages previous to this, gave the light of his word of promise,
   that his grace and truth might be brought the more distinctly into
   view. For this reason the prophet again repeats, that God was not led
   from some new cause to deliver his people, but that his design in doing
   so was to prove the faithfulness of his covenant, and to give it
   effect; just as if a man should dig up from the ground a treasure which
   he had buried in it. Nor is it to be doubted, that the prophet aimed at
   leading the faith of his countrymen still farther, -- that his object
   was that their posterity might be persuaded beyond all doubt, that as
   God had then proved, in the experience of that generation, the sure and
   substantial truth of his promise delivered many hundred years before,
   so he would not be to them otherwise than their fathers had found him
   to be in times past. Accordingly, he signalises this promise by the
   epithet, holy, intimating, that after the death of Abraham it retained
   its virtue and efficacy unimpaired. God had spoken it to Abraham; but
   the force of the covenant died not with him. God continued to show
   himself faithful towards the posterity of the patriarch.

   43. And he brought forth his people with joy The prophet makes mention
   of joy and gladness, the more highly to magnify the greatness of God's
   grace. It was no small matter, that at the very time when the Egyptians
   were afflicted by a severe and dreadful plague, -- when the whole
   kingdom was full of weeping and howling, -- and when in almost every
   house there was a dead body, -- the people who a little before were
   groaning in great distress, or rather lay almost dead, went forth with
   joyful hearts. By the appellation the chosen of God, they are reminded,
   that his favor was not thus exercised towards them on account of their
   own merits, or on account of the worth of their race, but because he
   had adopted them, that men having nothing left them in which to vaunt
   themselves might learn to glory in God alone.

   Psalm 105:44-45

   44. And he gave them the countries of the nations: and they possessed
   the labor of the peoples. [236] 45. That they might observe his
   ordinances, and keep his law. Hallelujah.


   44 And he gave them the countries of the nations The Psalmist sets
   forth the final cause why God in so many ways displayed his wonderful
   power in redeeming the people, why he did not cease to cherish and
   defend them in the deserts -- why he gave them the possession of the
   land as he had promised; and this was, that they might dedicate and
   devote themselves wholly to his service. And, in fact, the end which
   God proposed in our election was, that he might have on the earth a
   people by whom he should be called upon and served. The more
   effectually to stir up the Jews to gratitude, the prophet magnifies the
   greatness of the divine goodness, by declaring, that they occupied far
   and wide the countries of the nations, and that all the property which
   many states had acquired with great labor, they now possessed as it
   were by right of inheritance. The plural number, both as to the word
   countries and nations, serves to exhibit in a still more striking light
   the divine goodness in this matter. The psalm concludes with briefly
   defining the manner of glorifying God, That they might keep his law It
   would not be enough to celebrate his grace only with the tongue. To
   this there must be added practical and experimental piety. And as God
   rejects all religious services of men's invention, the only way of
   rightly serving him which remains, consists in keeping his
   commandments.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [236] That is, the products of their labor; their buildings, vineyards,
   cultivated fields, etc. The Israelites took possession of the land of
   Canaan, and of course possessed themselves of the advantages arising
   from its occupation, and cultivation by those who previously inhabited
   it. -- See Deuteronomy 6:10, 11; Joshua 24:13.

   [202] This psalm has no title in the Hebrew or Chaldee, but in the
   Vulgate, Septuagint, Æthiopic, and Arabic versions, the hallelujah
   which concludes the preceding psalm is prefixed as the inscription. The
   first fifteen verses correspond with the first part of a song of
   thanksgiving, which David composed to be sung after the ark had been
   brought from Obed-edom to Zion. -- See 1 Chronicles 15:8-22. Hence some
   conclude, that David was its inspired penman, and that he probably
   enlarged it at some subsequent period of his history, that it might
   supply a more complete commemoration of God's signal and extraordinary
   goodness towards the Israelites from the days of Abraham to their final
   settlement in the land of Canaan; while others conclude, that it was
   enlarged by some Hebrew bard, at the restoration of the Jews from the
   Babylonish captivity. This psalm bears a strong resemblance to the
   78th, as well in the subject as in the style, except perhaps that the
   diction here is rather of a more simple cast.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 106

   This psalm differs from the preceding, inasmuch as there the Psalmist
   showed that God had been more than a bountiful father to his chosen
   people, in order to procure for himself, in coming ages, a race of pure
   worshippers, while here he acknowledges that these remarkable benefits
   had been turned to a bad account; because the Jews from time to time
   threw off the yoke of God, basely abused his kindness, defiled
   themselves with many pollutions, and also perfidiously departed from
   his word. Nevertheless, it is not so much in the shape of a reproof or
   complaint, as a confession of their sins, in order to the obtaining the
   pardon of them. For the prophet commences with the praises of God, with
   the design of encouraging both himself and others to cherish good hope
   in him. Then he prays that God would continue his blessing to the seed
   of Abraham. But because the people, after so frequently revolting from
   God, were unworthy of the continuation of his kindness, he asks pardon
   to be extended to them, and this after he had confessed that from first
   to last, they had provoked God's wrath by their malice, ingratitude,
   pride, perfidy, and other vices. [237]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 106:1-5

   1. Hallelujah. [238] Praise ye Jehovah; because he is good; [239]
   because his mercy endureth for ever. 2. Who shall express the power of
   Jehovah? who shall declare all his praise? 3. Blessed are they that
   keep judgment, and blessed is he who worketh in righteousness at all
   times. [240] 4. Remember me, O Jehovah! with the good will which thou
   bearest towards thy people: visit me with thy salvation; 5. That I may
   see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the joy of thy
   nation, and glory with thy heritage.


   1. Praise ye Jehovah This exhortation supplies the want of a title; not
   that the psalm contains nothing else than thanksgiving and praise to
   God, but that the people, from the experience of past favors, may
   obtain the assurance of reconciliation; and thus entertain the hope
   that God, although at present offended, would soon be pacified towards
   them. In celebrating the praises of God, therefore, he orders them to
   call to mind such things as would have a tendency to assuage their
   grief on account of present ills, and to animate their spirits, and
   prevent them from sinking into despair. [241]

   2 Who shall express. This verse is susceptible of two interpretations;
   for if you read it in connection with the one immediately following,
   the sense will be, that all men are not alike equal to the task of
   praising God, because the ungodly and the wicked do nothing else than
   profane his holy name with their unclean lips; as it is said in the
   fiftieth psalm: "But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to
   declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
   mouth?" And hence to this sentence the following clause should have
   been annexed, in the form of a reply, Blessed are they that keep
   judgment I am of opinion, however, that the prophet had another design,
   namely, that there is no man who has ever endeavored to concentrate all
   his energies, both physical and mental, in the praising of God, but
   will find himself inadequate for so lofty a subject, the transcendent
   grandeur of which overpowers all our senses. Not that he exalts the
   power of God designedly to deter us from celebrating its praises, but
   rather as the means of stirring us up to do so to the utmost of our
   power. Is it any reason for ceasing our exertions, that with whatever
   alacrity we pursue our course, we yet come far short of perfection? But
   the thing which ought to inspire us with the greatest encouragement is,
   the knowledge that, though ability may fail us, the praises which from
   the heart we offer to God are pleasing to him; only let us beware of
   callousness; for it would certainly be very absurd for those who cannot
   attain to a tithe of perfection, to make that the occasion of their not
   reaching to the hundredth part of it.

   3 Blessed are they that keep judgment I make a distinction between this
   and the preceding verse, and yet so as to preserve the connection
   between them. For the prophet, having declared the magnitude of God's
   power to be such that no tongue could utter all its praises, now says,
   that the praises of the lip merely are not acceptable to God, but that
   the concurrence of the heart is indispensable, nay, that even the whole
   of our deportment must be in unison with this exercise. Now, when he
   first commands to keep judgment, and then to work righteousness, he
   gives us a short description of genuine godliness. I have no doubt,
   that in the former clause he describes the sincere affection of the
   heart, and that, in the latter, he refers to external works. For we
   know, there is nothing but the mere shadow of righteousness, unless a
   man cordially devote himself to the practice of honesty. He requires
   perseverance, too, that no one may imagine that he has discharged this
   duty properly, excepting he whose constant and continued aim it is to
   live righteously and justly. We behold not a few who have only an empty
   profession; others show some signs of virtue, but do not maintain a
   consistent course of conduct.

   4 Remember me By these words the prophet declares it to be his chief
   desire, that God would extend to him that love which he bore towards
   the Church, that he might thus become a participator of all the
   blessings which, from the very first, he bestows upon his chosen, and
   which day by day he continues with them. Nor does he desire this for
   himself alone, but in name of the Church Catholic, offers up a prayer
   alike for all, that, by his example, he might stimulate the faithful to
   present similar petitions.

   Remember me, says he, with the good will which thou bearest towards thy
   people; that is to say, grant to me the same unmerited kindness which
   thou art pleased to confer upon thy people, that so I may never be cut
   off from thy Church, but always be included among the number of thy
   children; for the phrase, good will towards thy people, is to be
   understood passively of that love which God graciously bears to his
   elect. It is, however, by a metonymy employed by the prophet to point
   out the marks of God's love. For from this gracious source flows that
   proof which he actually and experimentally gives of his grace. But the
   prophet, if accounted to belong to the number of the people of God,
   would consider this to be the summit of true happiness; because, by
   this means, he would feel that God was reconciled to him, (than which
   nothing is more desirables) and thus, too, he would experience that he
   was bountiful. The term, remember, relates to the circumstance of time,
   as we shall see towards the end of the psalm that it was penned when
   the people were in a state so sad and calamitous, that the faithful
   might entertain some secret apprehension that their God had forgotten
   them. To obviate this is the tendency of the next clause, visit me with
   thy salvation For God is said to visit those from whom he had
   apparently withdrawn himself; and their salvation is a demonstration of
   his good-will towards them. In the next verse he repeats the same
   sentiment, that I may see the good of thy chosen For he desires to be
   an associate and participator of the blessings which are constantly
   realised by the elect of God. The verb to see, is very plainly taken to
   denote the enjoyment of the blessings, as "to see the kingdom of God,"
   (John 3:3;) and "to see good and life" (1 Peter 3:10,) denote the
   corresponding blessings. Those who expound it, that I may see thee do
   good to the chosen, are mistaken; because the preceding verse upon
   which this depends will not bear this interpretation, and the
   exposition which I have given is supported by the words which follow,
   that I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, and glory with thy
   heritage For it is quite obvious that the prophet is solicitous to
   become a sharer in all the benefits which are the portion of the
   chosen, that, satisfied with God alone, he may, under his providential
   care, live joyfully and happily. Whatever might be the then mournful
   state of the Church, the prophet, amid all such tumult, still clings
   fast by this principle, that there is nothing better than to be
   regarded as belonging to the flock and people of God, who will always
   prove the best of fathers to his own, and the faithful guardian of
   their welfare. All that he asks is, that God would deal with him, as he
   is wont to deal with his Church; and declares that he could not bear
   the thought of being severed or separated from the common lot of the
   Church. These words, however, imply a tacit complaint that at that time
   God was withholding his loving-kindness from his afflicted Church, as
   if he had cast her off altogether.

   Psalm 106:6-11

   6. We have sinned with our fathers, we have acted iniquitously, we have
   done wickedly. 7. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
   remembered not the multitude of thy kindnesses; they rebelled at the
   sea, even the Red Sea. 8. Yet he saved them for his own name's sake,
   that he might make his power to be known. 9. Also he rebuked the Red
   Sea, and dried it up; and made them walk through the depths, as through
   the desert. 10. And saved them from the hand of the enemy, and
   delivered them from the hand of the wicked. 11. And the waters covered
   their oppressors: there was not one of them left.


   6 We have sinned with our fathers It is quite plain from these words,
   that although the prophet may have spoken in the person of one man, he
   yet dictates a form of prayer for the common use of the whole Church,
   seeing that he now identifies himself with the whole body. And from
   this to the end of the psalm, he gleans from ancient histories that
   their fathers had always been of a malign and perverse spirit, of
   corrupt practice, rebellious, ungrateful and perfidious towards God;
   and confesses that their descendants were not better; and having made
   this confession, [242] they come and ask the remission of their sins.
   And as we are unable to obtain the pardon of our sins until we have
   first confessed ourselves to be guilty of sin, and as our hardness of
   heart shuts out the grace of God from us, the prophet, therefore, with
   great propriety, humbly acknowledges the guilt of the people in this
   their severe and sore chastisement, and that God might justly inflict
   upon them a yet harder punishment. On another account it was
   advantageous for the Jews to have their sins set before them; because,
   if God punish us severely, we at once suppose that his promises have
   failed. But when, on the contrary, we are reminded that we are
   receiving the reward due to us for our transgressions, then if we
   thoroughly repent, those promises in which God appears as pacified
   towards us will come to our aid. Besides, by the three expressions
   which he employs in reference to their transgressions, he points out
   their enormity, that (as is usually the case) their hearts might not be
   slightly affected, but deeply wounded with sorrow. For we know how men
   are fettered by their vices, and how ready to let themselves alone,
   until compelled to examine themselves in good earnest; nay, what is
   more, when God calls them to judgment, they make a kind of verbal
   confession of their iniquities, while, at the same time, hypocrisy
   blinds their minds. When, therefore, the prophet says, that the people
   acted iniquitously in sinning, and had become ungodly and wicked, he
   employs no useless or unnecessary accumulation of words. Let any of us
   examine ourselves, and we will easily find that we have equal need to
   be constrained to make an ingenuous confession of our sins; for though
   we dare not say that we have no sin, yet there is not one of us but is
   disposed to find a cloak and subterfuge for his sin.

   In a very similar manner, Daniel, in the ninth chapter of his
   prophecies, acknowledges the guilt of his own iniquities and those of
   the people; and it may be that the author of this psalm followed his
   example. From both let us learn, that the only way of pleasing God is
   to institute a rigid course of self-examination. Let it also be
   carefully observed, that the holy prophets, who never departed from the
   fear and worship of God, uniformly confessed their own guilt in common
   with the people; and this they did, not out of feigned humility, but
   because they were aware that they themselves were tainted with manifold
   corruptions, for when iniquity abounds, it is almost impossible for
   even the best of men to keep themselves from being infected by its
   baneful effects. Not comparing themselves with others, but sisting
   themselves before God's tribunal, they at once perceive the
   impossibility of making their escape.

   At that time impiety had attained to such a degree of enormity among
   the Jews, that it is not astonishing if even the best and most upright
   men were carried away, as if by the violence of a tempest. How very
   abominable, then, is the pride of those who hardly imagine that they
   offend in the least possible way; nay, who even, like certain fanatics
   of the day, conceive that they have attained to a state of sinless
   perfection! It must be borne in mind, however, that Daniel, who
   carefully kept himself under the fear of God, and whom the Holy Spirit,
   by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel, declares to be one of the most
   upright of men, did not with reigned lips acknowledge his own
   transgressions, and those of the people, when he confessed them, under
   a deep sense of their grievously and dreadfully abhorrent character in
   the eyes of God. True, indeed, he was not overwhelmed in the same
   torrent of iniquity with others; but he knew that he had contracted a
   very large amount of guilt. Besides, the prophet does not bring forward
   their fathers for the purpose of palliating his own delinquency, (as
   many at the present day set at nought all reproof, shielding themselves
   with this, namely, that they have been so taught by their fathers, and
   that, therefore, their bad education, and not they, is at fault,) but
   rather to show that he and those of his own nation were obnoxious to
   severe punishment, because even from the very first, and as if
   co-existent with their early infancy, they never ceased to provoke the
   displeasure of God against themselves more and more by their fresh
   transgressions. It is in this manner that he involves the fathers with
   the children in many of the grounds of condemnation. [243]

   7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt, Here he relates how
   the people immediately, from the very commencement of their
   emancipation from bondage, were ungrateful to God, and conducted
   themselves in a rebellious manner. Nor does he confine himself to the
   history of one period only, but the whole drift of his narrative is to
   point out that the people had never ceased from doing wickedly,
   although God met them in return with inconceivable kindness; which is a
   proof of the invincible and desperate perversity of this nation. He
   first blames the folly of the people as the occasion of such
   ingratitude. In calling it folly, he does not intend to lessen the
   offense, (as some are often wont to do,) but to expose the vile and
   disgraceful stupidity of the people, in being blind in matters so
   plain; for God's works were such that even the blind might behold them.
   Whence could such gross ignorance originate, unless that Satan had so
   maddened them that they did not regard the miracles of God, which might
   have moved the very stones? Now, when he adds, they remembered not, he
   expresses more forcibly the inexcusable nature of their ignorance, nay,
   that their blindness was the result of stupid indifference, more than
   the want of proper instruction. For the cause of their ignorance was
   their overlooking those matters which, in themselves, were abundantly
   manifest. He further mentions how quickly that forgetfulness came upon
   them, which tended to increase their guilt. For it was marvelous that
   not even the very sight of these things could arouse their spirits.
   Hence it came to pass, that while they had scarcely made their
   departure from Egypt, and were passing through the sea, they proudly
   rose up against their deliverer. Surely not one year, nor even a
   century, ought to have erased from their minds deeds so worthy of being
   remembered. What madness, then, at that very time to murmur against
   God, as if he had abandoned them to be slaughtered by their enemies?
   That arm of the sea through which the people passed is, in the Hebrew,
   called the Sea of Suph. Some translate it the Sea of Sedge, and will
   have the word svph, suph, to signify sea-weed. [244] But whatever be
   its derivation, there can be no doubt about the place. It is very
   likely that the name was given to it because it abounded with rushes.

   8 And saved them The prophet here teaches what any one could easily
   learn from the preceding sentence, that the Israelites were saved, not
   on account of their deserving to be so, but because God had a regard to
   his own glory. That obstacle being removed, God went on to accomplish
   that deliverance which he had commenced, in order that his holy name
   might not become a reproach among the heathen. Besides, we must not
   overlook the antithesis between the name of God and the merits of men,
   because God, out of a regard to his own glory, can find in us no cause
   wherefore he should be moved to save us. The inestimable kindness of
   God, which, for the sake of a people so perverse, altered the usual
   order of nature, is more illustriously displayed by the account which
   is afterwards given of the means by which they were preserved. When he
   says that the sea was rebuked, he extols the power of God, at whose
   command and will the sea was dried up -- the waters receded, so that a
   free passage was opened up between the opposite heaps of waters. With
   the design of magnifying the miracle, he employs a similitude, which,
   in all likelihood, was drawn from Isaiah; for in the sixty-third
   chapter and thirteenth verse, he says, "Thou hast made thy people to
   walk through the deeps, as an horse in the wilderness, that he might
   not stumble." When the people walked through the sea as upon a dry
   plain, the prophet informs us that this was done solely by the
   astonishing power of God. It is quite possible, that in the desert in
   which the people wandered, there was many an abyss, the path rugged,
   and many a hill and dale and ragged rock. But it cannot be doubted that
   the prophet extols the power of God in the passage through the sea, and
   enhances it by this consideration, that the path through that deep sea
   was smooth. Besides, he gives greater strength to the miracle in saying
   that their enemies were drowned; because, when the sea afforded a free
   passage to the children of Israel, and covered and engulfed the
   Egyptians, so that not one of them escaped alive, whence proceeded this
   instantaneous difference, but from this, that God made a distinction
   between the one people and the other?

   [244] "At the Red Sea, i.e., at the Arabian Gulf; literally, at the Sea
   of Suph, which, if Suph be not here a proper name, (as it seems to be
   in Deuteronomy 1:1 and, with a slight variation, in Numbers 21:14)
   means the sea of weeds; and that sea is still called by a similar name
   in modern Egypt. This, its designation throughout the books of the Old
   Testament, is in the Syriac version and the Chaldee paraphrase likewise
   rendered the sea of weeds; which name may have been derived from the
   weeds growing near its shore, or from the weeds, or coralline
   productions, with which, according to Diodorus Siculus and Kircher, it
   abounded; and which were seen through its translucent waters. Finati,
   quoted by Laborde, speaks of the transparency of its waters, and the
   corals seen at its bottom " -- Cresswell. It has sometimes been
   asserted that this sea received the appellation of Red from its color.
   But it has been abundantly attested by those who have seen it, that it
   is no more red than any other sea. Niebuhr, in his description of
   Arabia, says, "The Europeans are accustomed to give the Arabian Gulf
   the name of Red Sea; nevertheless, I have not found it any more red
   than the Black Sea or the White Sea, or any other sea in the world."
   Artemidorus in Strabo expressly tells us that "it looks of a green
   color, by reason of the abundance of sea-weed and moss that grow in
   it;" which Diodorus Siculus also asserts of a particular part of it. It
   appears to have derived its name of "Red Sea" from Edom, which
   signifies red. Although throughout the whole Scriptures of the Old
   Testament it is called Yam Suph, the weedy sea, yet among the ancient
   inhabitants of the countries adjoining it was called Yam Edom, the sea
   of Edom, (1 Kings 9:26; 2 Chronicles 8:17, 18,) the land of Edom having
   extended to the Arabian Gulf; and the Edomites or Idumeans having
   occupied at one time a part, if not the whole, of Arabia Petraea. The
   Greeks, who took the name of the sea from the Phoenicians, who called
   it Yam Edom, instead of rendering it the sea of Edom, or, the Idumean
   Sea, as they ought to have done, took the word Edom, by mistake, for an
   appellative, instead of a proper name, and accordingly rendered it
   eruthra thalassa, that is, the Red Sea. Hence the LXX. translate Yam
   Suph, by the Red Sea; in which they have been followed by the authors
   of our English version. But the sea of weeds is undoubtedly the best
   translation of the Hebrew text. -- See Prideaux' Connections, etc.,
   volume 1, pages 39, 40.

   Psalm 106:12-15

   12. Then they believed his words; they sang his praises. 13. They made
   haste, and forgot his works; they did not attend to his counsel; 14.
   And lusted greatly in the desert, and tempted God in the wilderness.
   15. And he gave them their desire; but sent leanness into their soul.


   12. Then they believed his words In stating that they believed God's
   word, and sang his praise, the prophet does not say this to their
   commendation, but rather to increase, in a twofold manner, their guilt;
   because, being convinced by such indubitable testimony, they yet
   instantly resumed their wonted disposition of mind, and began to rebel
   against God, as if they had never beheld his wonderful works. How very
   inexcusable was that impiety which in a moment could forget the
   remarkable benefits which they had been constrained to admit!
   Overpowered by the grandeur of God's works, they were, he says, in
   spite of themselves, compelled to believe in God, and give glory to
   him, and thus the criminality of their rebellion was increased;
   because, although their stubbornness was overcome, yet they immediately
   relapsed into their former state of unbelief. A question, however,
   arises, seeing that true faith always corresponds with the nature of
   the word, and as the word is an incorruptible seed, so though it may
   happen to be almost, it never can be totally destroyed. But there is a
   temporary faith, as Mark calls it, (Mark 4:17) which is not so much a
   fruit of the Spirit of regeneration, as of a certain mutable affection,
   and so it soon passeth away. It is not a voluntary faith which is here
   extolled by the prophet, but rather that which is the result of
   compulsion, namely, because men, whether they will or not, by a sense
   which they have of the power of God, are constrained to show some
   reverence for him. This passage ought to be well considered, that men,
   when once they have yielded submission to God, may not deceive
   themselves, but may know that the touchstone of faith is when they
   spontaneously receive the word of God, and constantly continue firm in
   their obedience to it.

   In order to point out the inconstancy of the people, he says, they made
   haste Some explain this in the following manner, namely, that after
   they had set out on their journey, they hastened to come to the place
   called Marah. This, however, is to give a very tame representation of
   the emphatic style in which the prophet speaks, when severely
   reprehending their hasty and headlong departure from the way, in that
   they believed only for a very short time, and speedily forgot God's
   works; for they had only journeyed three days from their passage
   through the sea till they came to Marah, and yet they began to murmur
   against God, because they could not procure pleasant waters. [245]
   Meantime, we must here observe what we have seen elsewhere, that the
   alone cause why men are so ungrateful towards God, is their despising
   of his benefits. Were the remembrance of these to take fast hold of our
   hearts, it would serve as a bridle to keep us in his fear. The prophet
   declares what their transgression was, namely, that they did not
   suspend their desires till a fitting opportunity occurred for granting
   them. The insatiable nature of our desires is astonishing, in that
   scarcely a single day is allowed to God to gratify them. For should he
   not immediately satisfy them, we at once become impatient, and are in
   danger of eventually falling into despair. This, then, was the fault of
   the people, that they did not cast all their cares upon God, did not
   calmly call upon him, nor wait patiently until he was pleased to answer
   their requests, but rushed forward with reckless precipitation, as if
   they would dictate to God what he was to do. And, therefore, to
   heighten the criminality of their rash course, he employs the term
   counsel; because men will neither allow God to be possessed of wisdom,
   nor do they deem it proper to depend upon his counsel, but are more
   provident than becomes them, and would rather rule God than allow
   themselves to be ruled by him according to his pleasure. That we may be
   preserved from provoking God, let us ever retain this principle, That
   it is our duty to let him provide for us such things as he knows will
   be for our advantage. And verily, faith divesting us of our own wisdom,
   enables us hopefully and quietly to wait until God accomplish his own
   work; whereas, on the contrary, our carnal desire always goes before
   the counsel of God, by its too great haste.

   14. And they lusted He goes on, according to the history, to mention
   the sin which, agreeably to the duty of his office as a teacher, he had
   briefly noticed. Should any one inquire in what way they did not attend
   to God's counsel, he answers, because they had indulged in the
   gratification of their lusts; for the only way of acting with proper
   moderation is, when God rules and presides over our affections. It is
   therefore the more necessary to bridle that strong tendency to fleshly
   lusts which naturally rage within us. For whoever allows himself to
   desire more than is needful, openly sets himself in direct opposition
   to God, inasmuch as all fleshly lusts are directly opposed to him.

   To tempt God is not to acquiesce in his will, but to desire more than
   he is willing to grant. And since there are a variety of modes of
   tempting God, the prophet here adverts to one mode of doing so, namely,
   that the people had been so presumptuous as to limit God to means of
   their own devising; and thus, in rejecting the way which they ought to
   have followed, they ascribed to God a property altogether novel, as
   much as to say, If God do not feed us with flesh we will not regard him
   as God. He gave them the food which ought to have satisfied them. And
   though God is not limited by any means whatsoever, yet it is his will
   that our minds be rendered subservient to the means which he has
   appointed. For instance, although he can nourish us without bread,
   nevertheless it is his will that our life be sustained by such
   provision; and if we neglect it, and wish to point out to him another
   way of nourishing us, we tempt his power.

   15. He gave them their desire There is a fine paronomasia in the word
   rzvn, razon, for if, instead of z, zain, we read ts, tsädhé, the word
   would signify good pleasure. The prophet, therefore, in allusion to
   their lusting, by a word which is very similar to good pleasure or
   desire, says that God sent leanness into their souls; meaning by that,
   that he had indeed gratified the inordinate desires of the people, in
   such a way, however, as that those who had loathed the manna, now
   received nothing but leanness. [246] Thus the prophet would seem to
   charge the people with what we daily observe among those who live
   luxuriously and are fastidious, especially when their stomach, in
   consequence of the fluids poured into it, being vitiated, has no relish
   for wholesome food. For such persons only relish that food which is
   pernicious; and, therefore, the more they pamper themselves with it, so
   much the more do they become the creatures of noxious habits; and thus
   in a very short time, the very food itself makes them pine away. The
   prophet, seems, therefore, to apply to the mind what he says about the
   unhealthy state of the body, and to compare the Jews to those morbid
   persons, whose voraciousness, instead of promoting health, injures it,
   because they do not derive any nourishment from their food. The reason
   is, that God withheld his blessing from the food which they had so
   immoderately longed for, in order that this their punishment for their
   transgression might humble them. But their perversity is seen to be
   very great, in that even this mode of punishing them did not overcome
   their stubborn hearts. It is a proverbial saying, that fools learn
   wisdom from the experience of evil. How insane and incorrigible must
   they have been, whom even compulsion itself could not reform!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [245] The history to which reference is here made is recorded in Exodus
   15 We read in the 22nd verse of that chapter, that the Israelites "went
   out into the wilderness of Shur, and they went three days in the
   wilderness, and found no water." They then came to Marah, where there
   was abundance of water; but it was so bitter that they could not drink
   of it. Being thus disappointed in the hopes with which the first sight
   of these waters inspired them, they murmured against Moses, and said,
   "What shall we drink?" How rapid the transition from gratitude and
   praise to discontent and murmuring! No sooner did a new trouble befall
   that people, than they forthwith yielded to impatience, forgat the long
   series of miracles which had been wrought for their deliverance from
   Egypt, and distrusting God, appeared to be at once prepared to break
   out in rebellion against him and Moses their leader.

   [246] The reference here is to the quails which God granted to the
   people in answer to their request for flesh, but which, from the excess
   in which they partook of them, so far from affording nourishment,
   proved the cause of disease. When food of an unwholesome quality, or
   too much of that which is wholesome, is eaten, nature with much
   violence seeks to throw it off from the system by the several
   evacuations, upon which follows a sudden and almost incredible
   deprivation of strength and flesh. The Israelites, when God gave them
   the quails, having indulged their appetite to an immoderate degree,
   (Exodus 16:8; Psalm 78:25, 29,) the effect was their being seized with
   a sudden and wasting sickness, which is supposed by some to have been
   what is called cholera, a disease which produces a rapid prostration of
   strength and emaciation of the whole frame. This opinion seems
   confirmed from what is stated in Numbers 11:20, where it is threatened
   that the quails should "come out at their nostrils," probably
   indicating the violent vomitings which accompany that malady. It is
   indeed said, that the Lord smote the people with a very great plague,
   Numbers 11:33. But God's agency, and even his miraculous agency, admits
   of the subserviency of means. French and Skinner read the clause, "But
   sent a wasting disease among them." "The word rzh, to attenuate,
   emaciate," says Hammond, "is used also for destroying, Zephaniah 2:11,
   when God threatens that he will emaciate, i.e., destroy all the gods.
   And then rzvn, may be rendered, more generally, destruction or plague,
   and so R. Tanchum on Zephaniah renders it destruction."

   Psalm 106:16-22

   16. And they envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the saint of Jehovah.
   17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered over the tent
   of Abiram. 18. And a fire was kindled in their assembly, and the flame
   consumed the wicked. 19. They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped
   before the molten image. 20. And they changed their glory into the
   likeness of an ox that eateth grass. 21. They forgot God their
   preserver, who had done great things in Egypt; 22. And wondrous works
   in the land of Ham, and terrible things at the Red Sea.


   16. And they envied He refers here very shortly to another
   transgression, and that, too, in such a way as to furnish both to
   himself and others ample grounds for deep consideration. For, as the
   people, in devising from time to time new modes of sinning, displayed
   so much cunning in their attempts to provoke God's anger, so we ought
   the more to be filled with fear on that account. Moreover, when he says
   that they envied Moses and Aaron, his meaning is, that, acting under
   the influence of diabolic pride, they had risen up against God, and
   were endeavoring to throw off the yoke which he had laid upon them;
   according as Moses also said,

   "What am I, and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against us?" (Numbers
   16:11)

   As it was the will of God to rule the people by means of Moses and
   Aaron, not to submit to their rule was virtually to set themselves
   obstinately to resist the authority of God himself. There is therefore
   great importance attached to the term, envy, namely, that at the very
   time when God was treating the children of Israel with the utmost
   kindness and care, they yet were discontented with their lot, and
   rebelled against him. Could such madness serve any other purpose than
   to show, that, casting off all farther dependence upon the providence
   of God for their support, they aspire to rise above the very heavens?
   In this sense Aaron is called the saint of Jehovah, [247] in order that
   we might know that both he and Moses were equally identified with God;
   for under the person of the one, the designation is applied to both,
   and in this way the prophet shows that they had been Divinely invested
   with that authority which they were exercising. In renouncing their
   authority, therefore, and, to the utmost of their power, dishonoring
   these saints, Dathan and Abiram were rebelling not against men, but
   against God.

   17 The earth opened The heinousness of their sin may be seen in the
   magnitude of the punishment by which it was visited. But the design of
   the prophet was to accuse and reprove publicly the obstinacy of the
   people, who, so far from being bettered by their corrections, (although
   the vengeance of God was so terrible as almost to move the very
   stones,) conducted themselves the more perversely. That was surely an
   awfully ominous event, when the earth swallowed up alive Dathan and
   Abiram, and all their accomplices; and when fire coming down from
   heaven consumed [248] them, according to the saying of Moses,

   "If any thing common happen to these men, then believe not that God who
   ruleth in heaven rules over you and me; but if this new and
   extraordinary thing happen, namely, that the earth open her mouth and
   swallow them up, then indeed believe that I am sent by God," Numbers
   16:29

   When the Israelites were so infatuated as to rise in rebellion against
   God, then did the terrible nature of their distemper appear in that it
   could not be cured by the stringent remedy which was applied to it. And
   as even hypocrites are afraid when they feel the severity of God, it
   was the height of folly in them to fret and quarrel with God where he
   was visiting their iniquities with stripes. Should any one ask why God
   charges the faults of a few upon the whole body of the people? the
   answer is obvious; for although there were only two individuals who
   were the principal abettors of the conspiracy, and along with them two
   hundred and seventy seditious persons, yet it would seem, from the
   murmurings and cavillings of the whole congregation, that they also
   were affected with the same distemper. The punishment did not extend
   beyond the captains [249] and ringleaders of this wicked conspiracy, it
   being the design of God to mitigate it, and to spare the people at
   large, who nevertheless had been most desirous of innovation, seeing
   they could not endure the authority of Moses and Aaron.

   19. They made a calf. [250] Here he represents their rebellion as
   exceedingly base, in that they abandoned the true worship of God, and
   made to themselves a calf. For although it was their intention to
   worship God in this manner, yet the prophet reprehends their brutal
   stupidity, because they worshipped before the molten image, [251] and
   represented God by the figure of an ox which eateth grass [252] From
   this the prophet infers, that God had been robbed of his honor, and
   that all his glory had been tarnished. And surely it is so; for
   although the idolaters feign to serve God with great zeal, yet when, at
   the same time, they represent to themselves a God visible, they abandon
   the true God, and impiously make for themselves an idol. But he
   reproaches them with being guilty of still greater impiety, when he
   says, after the likeness of an ox that eateth grass; and contrasts with
   it their honor or glory. For seeing that God had clothed them with his
   own glory, what madness was it to substitute in place of him not only
   an ox, but the inanimate form of an ox, as if there were any
   resemblance between God who createth all kinds of food, and that stupid
   animal which feeds upon grass?

   It is necessary, however, to observe the design of the prophet, which
   is to point out the blindness of men as more base and abominable,
   because not contenting themselves with any common form of superstition,
   but casting off all sham they give themselves up to the most shocking
   forms of worshipping God. Had the people formed for themselves a
   likeness of God under the likeness of a man, even that would have been
   impiously robbing God of his due; how much more shameful was their
   conduct when they assimilated God to an ox? When men preserve their
   life by eating and drinking, they acknowledge how frail they are,
   because they derive [253] from dead creatures the means of its
   continuation. How much greater is the dishonor done to God when he is
   compared to the brutal tribes? Moreover, the comparison referred to
   increases the enormity of their guilt. For what credit was it for a
   holy people to worship the inanimate likeness of an ox instead of the
   true God? But God had condescended to spread out the overshadowing
   wings of his glory upon the children of Abraham, that he might put on
   them the highest honor. Therefore, in denuding themselves of this
   honor, they had exposed their own baseness to the derision of all the
   nations of the earth. And hence Moses employs the phrase of nakedness,
   when he is showing that crime of idolatry:

   "And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had made
   them naked unto their shame among their enemies)"
   Exodus 32:25.

   Should any one be disposed to say that the ark of the covenant was a
   representation of God, my answer is, That that symbol was given to the
   children of Israel, not to engross the whole of their attention, but
   only for the purpose of assisting and directing them in the spiritual
   worship of God.

   21. They forgot God The prophet again repeats that the people had
   sinned not simply through ignorance, but also wilfully, inasmuch as God
   had already given a very palpable manifestation of his power and glory.
   And as he makes himself known in the creation of the heavens and of the
   earth, the blindness of men is totally inexcusable. But far more
   aggravating is the sin of the children of Israel, who, after God had
   made himself known to them, in the most condescending manner, cast him
   off altogether, and gave themselves up to the practice of brutish
   idolatry. And God having from heaven put forth his Almighty power for
   their salvation, there must surely be no little importance attached to
   such displays of his power as proclaim the praise and honor of his
   great name. Had he merely given an ordinary token of his power, even
   that ought to have attracted so much consideration as should have kept
   the people in the fear and worship of God. Now, that these miracles
   were so very notable, or rather terrible and rare, the people acted a
   very base part to shut their eyes upon them, and give themselves over
   to idolatry. For as the darkness is dispelled by the beamy lustre of
   the sun, so all inventions and perverse errors should vanish before
   such knowledge of God.

   Psalm 106:23-27

   23. And he said that he would destroy them, unless that Moses his
   chosen had stood in the breach before his face, to turn away his wrath,
   that he might not destroy them. 24. And they despised the pleasant
   land; they did not believe his word; 25. And they murmured in their
   tents, and did not listen to the voice of Jehovah. 26. And he lifted up
   his hand against them, to destroy them in the desert: 27. And to
   destroy their seed among the heathen, and to scatter them throughout
   the lands. [254]


   23. And he said The prophet informs us, by these words, that the people
   had a feeling sense of their remarkable deliverance from impending
   destruction, by means of prayer alone, which, for a season, restrained
   God's vengeance from bursting forth against them. In a very short time,
   however, they return to their wonted disposition of mind, a striking
   proof of the awful perversity of their hearts. To represent how highly
   God was offended, the prophet says that he had purposed to destroy the
   transgressors: not that God is subject to human passions, to be very
   angry for a little, and then immediately afterwards, on being appeased,
   changes his purpose; for God, in his secret counsel, had resolved upon
   their forgiveness, even as he actually did pardon them. But the prophet
   makes mention of another purpose, by which God designed to strike the
   people with terror, that coming to know and acknowledge the greatness
   of their sin, they might be humbled on account of it. This is that
   repentance so frequently referred to in the Scriptures. Not that God is
   mutable in himself; but he speaks after the manner of men, that we may
   be affected with a more feeling sense of his wrath: like a king who had
   resolved to pardon an offender, yet sisted him before his
   judgment-seat, the more effectually to impress him with the magnitude
   of the kindness done to him. God, therefore, while he keeps to himself
   his secret purpose, declared openly to the people that they had
   committed a trespass which deserved to be punished with eternal death.
   Next he says that Moses stood in the breach, meaning that he had made
   intercession with God, lest his awful vengeance might break forth among
   the people. There is here an allusion to the manner in which cities are
   stormed; for if a breach is made in the wall by any of the various
   engines which are employed in war, brave soldiers will instantly throw
   themselves into the breach to defend it. [255] Hence Ezekiel reproaches
   the false prophets, who, unlike Moses, deceiving the people by their
   flatteries, making, as it were, a mud-wall, do not place themselves in
   the breach in the day of battle.

   "Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the
   house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord,"
   Ezekiel 13:5.

   Some expositors are of opinion that the prophet refers to the
   separation which the people had made among themselves in violating the
   covenant of God, and the sacred relation in which they stood to each
   other; but the meaning is the same. For in that breach which gave rise
   to this metaphor or similitude, God, in defending his people so
   faithfully, was to them in place of a wall or bulwark. Having provoked
   him to anger anew, he was about to rush upon them for their
   destruction, had not Moses interposed as their intercessor.

   24. And they despised It was an evident demonstration of the
   unconquerable wickedness of the Jews, that, after they had been in the
   jaws of destruction, and while they had scarcely escaped from danger so
   great and so imminent, they rose up in rebellion against God. What was
   the cause of this rebellion? The despising of the Holy Land, which of
   all things ought to have been most desired by them. The country of
   Canaan, which had been destined to them, as the place where they were
   to be brought up under God's paternal care, and as a people separated
   from heathen nations were to worship him only, and which, also, was
   more especially to them a pledge of the heavenly inheritance, -- this
   country here, and in several other passages, is very properly called
   the pleasant land Was it not, then, the basest ingratitude to despise
   the holy habitation of God's chosen people? To the cause of this scorn
   the prophet refers, when he says, they did not believe God's word For
   had they laid hold upon God's promise with that faith which it was
   incumbent upon them to do, they would have been inflamed with such a
   strong desire for that land, that they would have surmounted all
   obstacles which might occur in their way to it. Meanwhile, not
   believing his word, they not only refuse the heritage which was offered
   to them, but excite a rebellion in the camp, as if they would rise up
   in arms against God.

   26. And he lifted up. He describes another example of the vengeance of
   God, the recollection of which ought to have been deeply seated in
   their hearts, so that cherishing a constant fear of him, they might
   watch over themselves with the utmost solicitude. No good having ensued
   from all this, it is obvious that the madness of that people was
   incurable. At that time God did restrain his anger, in that he did not
   disperse their offspring throughout various parts of the earth; but his
   threatening of itself ought to have sufficed for the subduing of their
   pride, had they not been incorrigible. To lift up the hand is in this
   passage susceptible of two meanings. In Scripture God is frequently
   said to lift up his hand to inflict punishment. But as it is generally
   admitted that the prophet is here speaking of swearing, [256] with this
   opinion I most readily coincide. The practice of lifting up the hand,
   as if they would have called God down from heaven, was a solemn usual
   rite among them, accompanying an oath; and is therefore improperly
   applied to God, whose sublimity rises above all things, and who, as the
   apostle says, cannot swear by a greater than himself, (Hebrews 6:13) In
   employing it, therefore, it must be understood that he borrows it from
   the common customs which prevail among men. Had not the Holy Land been
   preserved to the people by the prayers of Moses, awful indeed would
   their dispersion have been.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [254] Some interpreters, as Mudge and Horsley, have felt great
   difficulty in interpreting this verse. "Nothing," says the latter
   critic, "was said about overthrowing the seed, at the time when the
   adults, which came out of Egypt, were sentenced to perish in the
   wilderness. On the contrary, it was promised that their little ones,
   i.e., those who were under the age of twenty years at the time of the
   general muster, should be settled in the land of Canaan. -- See Numbers
   14." He farther adds, that "nothing was said at the time alluded to
   about scattering the seed, which should be settled in Canaan, in some
   future period, through the lands." And he concludes his note on the
   verse by observing, that, upon the whole, he could not explain it to
   his own satisfaction. But there seems in the passage to be a reference
   to those prophetical denunciations afterwards uttered, by which God
   threatened that he would punish the sins of the Israelites, not only in
   their own persons, but also in their posterity; -- denunciations which
   have been fulfilled in the various dispersions of that people, and
   which are fulfilling at the present day. -- Leviticus 26:33;
   Deuteronomy 28:64. "It is obvious," says Dr Morison, "that those
   interpreters are mistaken who refer the allusions of the 27th verse to
   the same history as those of the 26th. The people overthrown in the
   wilderness were to be destroyed by pestilence; but the overthrow
   threatened in the 27th verse was by banishment and captivity."

   [255] The sins of the people had opened a breach or gap, for God as an
   enemy to enter and destroy them. But, like soldiers who stand in the
   breach that has been made in the walls of a beleaguered city to oppose
   the irruption of the enemy, Moses, by his earnest prayer, stopped this
   breach, Exodus 32:11-14. "Moses is here mentioned in the character of a
   mediator, under the figure of one standing in the breach of the wall of
   a city made by besiegers, to oppose any farther hostile aggressions.
   The figure of a breach is frequently employed in Scripture to denote
   some destruction by God. Thus in Judges 21:15, God made a breach,phrph,
   in the tribes of Israel, i.e., He destroyed one of the tribes, viz.,
   that of Benjamin: see also 2 Samuel 6:8; Ezekiel 22:30. Hence in this
   passage we understand that God would have destroyed the Israelites, had
   not Moses stood in the breach, i.e., interceded by his prayers, just at
   the time when the divine judgments were about to be executed. The
   Chaldee has paraphrased it thus, If Moses had not stood before Him and
   prevailed in prayer, i.e., arrested the destruction." -- Phillips

   [256] The passage refers to the oath which God swore against that
   people recorded in Numbers 14:21-23. To the same oath there is an
   allusion in Psalm 95:11. The Chaldee paraphrast has, "He lifted up his
   hand with an oath."

   Psalm 106:28-31

   28. And they joined themselves to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of
   the dead. 29. And they provoked God to anger by their works, [257] and
   the plague broke out among them. 30. And Phinehas stood up, and
   executed justice: and the plague was stopped. 31. And that deed was
   imputed to him for righteousness from generation to generation for
   ever.


   28 And they joined themselves to Baal-peor The prophet tells us that
   the Jews, after they had been threatened with very awful punishment,
   very soon fell into a new species of apostasy. Some think, that they
   are indirectly accused of falling away to the superstitions of the
   Midianites, in consequence of having been imposed upon by female
   intrigue. This, it is well known, was the design of Balaam, as soon as
   he knew that he was forbidden by God to curse the people. His counsel
   to king Balak was to set the daughters of Moab before the people, to
   entice them by their allurements to the practice of idolatry,

   "Behold, these women caused the children of Israel, through the counsel
   of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor."
   Numbers 31:16

   And as the idolatry here mentioned originated from carnal intrigues,
   some expositors are of opinion, that on this account the prophet
   charges the people with the commission of a twofold trespass, in their
   not only being inveigled by the Midianitish women, but also in binding
   themselves by another bond to Baal-peor, (Numbers 25) Be that as it
   may, the prophet exclaims against the perfidy of his own nation,
   because in forsaking the true worship of God, they had broken that holy
   union by which they had been betrothed to him. For we know, that as God
   adopts the Church as his spouse, when she gives herself up to idolatry,
   she no less shamefully violates her fidelity, than when a wife leaves
   her husband, and becomes an adulteress. It is well known, that
   Baal-peor was the idol of the Midianites; but it is not so well known
   how he received this appellation. The word vl, Baal, has a
   signification [258] equivalent to lord, master, or patron. And since
   phr, paar, signifies to open, some render it the God of opening, and
   assign as a reason, which, however, I dare not affirm, their shamefully
   exposing themselves in his presence. Perhaps it is the name of some
   place, for we know that the heathens often gave to their idols the
   names of the countries where they were worshipped. [259] We now
   perceive the prophet's meaning, That the Jews had wickedly revolted
   from God, and defiled themselves in joining themselves to Baal-peor. In
   saying that they ate the sacrifices of the dead, [260] he points out
   the greater baseness of their offense. By the sacrifices of idols, he
   means that they ate things that were offered to idols, as they had been
   wont to partake of those sacrifices which bound them to the true God,
   the inexhaustible fountain of life. Hence their conduct was the more
   detestable, when they wilfully gave themselves over to death by
   perpetrating such a heinous crime. And we know, that banqueting was to
   some extent connected with their worship. The result of this was, that,
   renouncing the true God, they joined themselves in marriage with the
   dead; and thus the prophet charges them with acting a very disgraceful
   part, in not only bowing the knee to Baal, and offering sacrifices to
   him, but also in feasting upon these sacrifices.

   29. And they provoked God to anger. The prophet once more informs us,
   that they had been put upon their guard by another plague, in order
   that it might appear that God had always a strict regard for his own
   glory, in chastising the people; but as they were not bettered by these
   plagues, these chastisements were fruitless. Having formerly stated,
   that God's wrath had been appeased by the prayers of Moses, he now
   says, that the plague had been arrested or ceased by means of the kind
   interposition of Phinehas. Some render the word phll, pillel, to pray;
   but the other rendering, to execute justice, is more in accordance with
   the context; namely, that by his zeal in executing justice upon the
   profligates, he turned away God's vengeance from the Israelites. He
   stood up therefore, that is, he rose up or interposed, when all others
   maintained a careless indifference. As the Jews were sensible that it
   was by the kind intervention of one man that the plague was now healed,
   their obstinacy was the less excusable in not even then ceasing to sin.
   We must not forget that all these things are addressed to us. For when
   God from time to time chastises us, and calls upon us to repent by
   setting before us the example of others, how few profit by his
   corrections! Moreover, it deserves to be noticed, that the plague
   ceased at the very time when Phinehas executed justice. From this we
   may learn, that the most effectual way to quench the fire of God's
   anger, is when the sinner willingly sits in judgment upon himself for
   the punishment of his own transgressions; as Paul says, 1 Corinthians
   11:31,

   "If we would judge ourselves, verily we would not be judged of the
   Lord."

   And surely God confers no small honor upon us, in placing the
   punishment of our sins within our reach. At the same time, it must be
   observed, that on that occasion the plague ceased in consequence of the
   punishment of a single person, because the people then shrunk from the
   abominable wickedness to which they had been addicted.

   31. And that deed was imputed The prophet, in thus praising one
   individual, heaps reproach upon the whole body of the people. For we
   infer from this token of approbation with which the Holy Spirit
   condescended to stamp the excellent action of Phinehas, how very base
   their conduct must have been. Neither was this honor reserved for him
   alone, but his posterity were to enjoy it throughout their succeeding
   generations. In order, therefore, to cast the greater reproach upon the
   people, Phinehas alone is contrasted with them. Some may be disposed to
   inquire, how the zeal of a single individual, overstepping the
   boundaries [261] of his calling, taking a sword and executing justice,
   could be approved of God? For it would seem, as if he had ventured upon
   this action without due consideration. I answer, that the saints have
   sometimes been under peculiar and extraordinary impulses, which ought
   not to be estimated by the ordinary standard of actions. When Moses
   slew the Egyptian, (Exodus 2:12) though not yet called by God to be the
   deliverer of Israel, and while he was not yet invested with the power
   of the sword, it is certain, that he was moved by the invisible and
   internal impulse of God to undertake that deed. Phinehas was moved by a
   similar impulse. No one indeed imagined that he was armed with the
   sword of God, yet he was conscious to himself of being moved by a
   heavenly influence in this matter. And hence it is to be observed, that
   the common mode and order of calling which God adopts, does not prevent
   him, whenever it seems proper, to stir up his elect by the secret
   influence of the Spirit to the performance of praiseworthy deeds.

   But a more difficult question still remains, How that one action could
   be imputed to Phinehas for righteousness? [262] Paul proves that men
   are justified by faith alone, because it is written,

   "Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness,"
   Romans 4:3

   In Genesis 15:6, Moses employs the same word. If the same thing may be
   said respecting works, the reasoning of Paul will be not only feeble,
   but frivolous. First of all, let us examine, whether or not Phinehas
   was justified on account of this deed alone. Verily the law, though it
   could justify, by no means promises salvation to any one work, but
   makes justification to consist in the perfect observance of all the
   commandments. It remains, therefore, that we affirm, that the work of
   Phinehas was imputed to him for righteousness, in the same way as God
   imputes the works of the faithful to them for righteousness, not in
   consequence of any intrinsic merit which they possess, but of his own
   free and unmerited grace. And as it thus appears, that the perfect
   observance of the law alone (which is done no where) constitutes
   righteousness, all men must prostrate themselves with confusion of face
   before God's judgment-seat. Besides, were our works strictly examined,
   they would be found to be mingled with much imperfection. We have,
   therefore, no other source than to flee for refuge to the free
   unmerited mercy of God. And not only do we receive righteousness by
   grace through faith, but as the moon borrows her light from the sun, so
   does the same faith render our works righteous, because our corruptions
   being mortified, they are reckoned to us for righteousness. In short,
   faith alone, and not human merit, procures both for persons and for
   works the character of righteousness. I now return to Paul. And it is
   not from a single expression, that he argues that we are justified
   freely, and by faith only, but he assumes higher principles, to which I
   lately referred, that all men are destitute of righteousness, until God
   reconcile them to himself by the blood of Christ; and that faith is the
   means by which pardon and reconciliation are obtained, because
   justification by works is no where to be obtained. Hence he very
   properly concludes, that we are justified by faith alone. But
   righteousness by works is as it were subordinate (as they say) to the
   righteousness just mentioned, while works possess no value in
   themselves, excepting, and as far as, out of pure benevolence, God
   imputes them to us for righteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [257] In our English Bible it is "their inventions." "Rather," says
   Horsley, "their frolics.'"

   [258] "Signifie autant comme Maistre ou Patron." -- Fr.

   [259] Baal was a very common name of the principal male god of the
   nations of the East, as Ashtaroth was a common one for their chief
   female deity. The Moabites, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and
   often the Hebrews, worshipped this idol. Among the Babylonians, he was
   called Bel or Belus. The sun only might at first be worshipped under
   that name, as we know that under it the Phoenicians adored that
   luminary. But at length it came to be applied to many other idols,
   according to these words of the Apostle, "There be gods many, and
   baalims, or lords many," 1 Corinthians 8:5. As the idol Jupiter among
   the Romans had different names and different rites of worship,
   occasioned sometimes from the different benefits which he was thought
   to bestow upon men, as Jupiter Pluvius, because he gave rain, Jupiter
   Lucetius, because he gave light, Jupiter Altitonans, from thundering;
   and sometimes from different places -- as Jupiter Olympius, from the
   hill Olympus, Jupiter Capitolinus, from the Capitol hill, Jupiter
   Latialis, from that part of Italy which is called Latium: so Baal had
   his distinctive titles, and different rites of worship, occasioned in
   the same manner. He sometimes received his name from the benefits he
   was supposed to confer, as Baal-tsephon, (Exodus 14:1) the latter term
   denoting a watcher, and Baalzebub, (2 Kings 1:2) which signifies the
   lord of the flies. He was worshipped under this last name by the
   Cyrenians, but principally by Ekronites, because, whenever they
   sacrificed to him, they believed that the swarms of flies, which at
   that time molested the country, would die. At other times he received a
   distinctive appellation from the places where he was worshipped, as
   Baal-peor, from the hill Peor, mentioned in Numbers 23:28; and his
   temple, whither his votaries resorted, standing on the same hill, was
   called Beth-peor, Deuteronomy 3:29. Possibly, however, the mountain
   might have taken its name from the god that was there worshipped. The
   idol named Chemosh, in Jeremiah 48:7, is thought to be the same as
   Baal-peor. "I take it," says Goodwin, "to be applied to Baal-peor, by
   way of contempt, as if one should say their blind god, according to
   that in the psalm, They have eyes, and see not;' for the first letter,
   caph, signifies as it were, or like, and mvs, musch, to grope, or feel
   about in manner of blind men." Moses and Aaron, page 170. This idol was
   also called Baal-bereth, (Judges 8:33, and 9:4,) from his worshippers
   binding themselves to him by covenant.

   [260] "The dead" appears to be a term of contempt applied to idols.
   They are so called in opposition to the true and living God. There may
   also be an allusion to the fact, that many of the heathen idols were
   men who had been deified after their death.

   [262] And it was counted to him for righteousness. Dr Hammond properly
   observes, that this expression signifies something more than
   justifying, as being the opposite of condemning; for thus it would
   denote no more than acquitting Phinehas, who had certainly committed no
   offense; on the contrary, by this act an offended God was satisfied. He
   gives to tsdqh, therefore, the sense of reward, in which he is
   supported by the Chaldee, which has lzkv, for merit. Mendlessohn also,
   in his Beor to Genesis 15:6, where this phrase occurs, assigns to tsdqh
   the meaning of merit or reward. The reward in this case, we learn from
   the history, consisted in placing the priesthood in his family for ever
   and ever, as stated in the next portion of the verse. -- See Numbers
   25:13." -- Phillips.

   Psalm 106:32-39

   32. And they provoked him to anger at the waters of strife [263] , and
   it turned out ill to Moses on their account: 33. For they grieved his
   spirit, [264] so that he spake with his lips. 34. They did not destroy
   the nations whom Jehovah had commanded them: 35. But were mingled with
   [265] the heathen, and learned their works. 36. And served their idols:
   which were the occasion of their overthrow. 37. And sacrificed their
   sons and daughters unto devils, 38. And they shed innocent blood, the
   blood of their sons and their daughters whom they sacrificed to the
   idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled with blood. 39. And they were
   polluted with their own works, and went a whoring after their own
   inventions. [266]


   32 And they provoked him The prophet mentions another offense of which
   they were guilty, in that, they contended with God at the waters of
   strife, from which circumstance that place derived its name. The clamor
   was, it is true, raised directly against Moses, but if we examine the
   matter properly, we will find that they virtually murmured against God
   himself. And to point out the aggravation of their offense, he says
   that Moses was hardly dealt with on their account. From this it may be
   inferred that their transgression was very heinous, in that God did not
   spare even his own servant, whom he had chosen in preference to all
   others. We do not deny that Moses deserved that punishment; but if we
   search for the origin of the trespass, we will find that it was the sin
   of the people that was visited upon him. If Moses was prevented from
   entering the land of Canaan, because through the influence of the sin
   of others, and in opposition to the convictions of his own mind, he had
   been hurried on to the commission of iniquity, how much more
   inexcusable is the impiety of that people who deliberately strove with
   God, and by their folly and fretfulness, brought in Moses for a share
   of their guilt?

   33. For they grieved his spirit The verb mrh, marah, properly signifies
   to vex or irritate, but as it is here put in what the Hebrews call the
   Hiphil conjugation, some are of opinion that it is to be understood
   passively, to denote that it was the people who were the occasion of
   the rebellion; which interpretation does not appear to me to be very
   objectionable. I cannot, however, agree with those who would have the
   particle 't, eth, to be a sign of what is denominated the dative case,
   as if Moses might be said to have rebelled against the Spirit of God.
   Had he done so, then assuredly the prophet would not have spoken so
   severely of the sin and folly into which he had inadvertently fallen.
   The meaning which I have already given answers very well, That the
   prime movers of the rebellion must have committed a very heinous
   offense, seeing that Moses, who had been pushed on by the impetuosity
   of the people to sin, was so severely dealt with by God. But while the
   prophet informs us that Moses was punished on the people's account, he
   is not to be understood as saying that he was altogether blameless. For
   even admitting that his spirit was ruffled in consequence of the tumult
   of the people, this ought to have made him the more careful to continue
   steadfast in his adherence to the Law of God. He adds, that he spoke
   with his lips; and this I take to refer to Moses, there being no ground
   for the conjecture that it refers to the punishment which God expressly
   denounced against Moses. It is more likely that these words were
   intended by the prophet to express how greatly the spirit of Moses was
   agitated when he openly murmured against God. The prophet, therefore,
   informs us that the submissive and gentle spirit of Moses was fanned,
   as it were, into a breeze by the perverseness of the people, so that
   even he spake un-advisedly, saying, "Can God give you water out of the
   rock?" (Numbers 20:10) For such was the indignation which he felt
   burning within him, that he could not calmly wait for the commandment
   of God to smite the rock.

   34. They did not destroy the nations It appears to me that those
   persons are mistaken who think that the prophet is here simply giving a
   relation of the punishment which was inflicted upon the Jews, as if he
   were imputing to them the entire blame of not exterminating the
   nations, in consequence of their not deserving the honor of obtaining
   any more victories over them. But he rather prefers another charge
   against them, that they had been remiss in driving out the heathen, or
   more probably that they had not obeyed the Divine command to root them
   out of the land. Now that the cup of the iniquity of the Amorites was
   full, it was the purpose of God that they should be exterminated, lest
   their society might prove injurious to the holy people. For God, having
   chosen that land for a habitation to himself, intended that it should
   be holy and purified from all defilement. In refusing, therefore, to
   execute the vengeance enjoined upon them, the people showed their
   willingness to associate with the uncircumcised inhabitants of Canaan.
   In manifesting such indifference about God's command respecting the
   driving out these nations, they gave just cause for his anger waxing
   hot against them. Behold, saith he, I have commanded all these nations
   to be cut off by the sword; and now, because ye have not obeyed my
   voice,

   "they shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall
   vex you in the land wherein ye dwell," Numbers 33:55

   The not destroying all these nations, but permitting some of them to
   remain, might appear to be an act of mercy; but in thus acting, the
   people were guilty of neglecting to execute God's righteous vengeance
   upon them, and of leaving the land liable to be polluted with their
   abominations. From these things it ought to be noticed, that there are
   two extremes in which men are apt to indulge, either in being
   unnecessarily over rigorous, or in defeating the ends of justice by too
   great lenity. We must, therefore, adhere strictly to God's command, if
   we would desire to shun both extremes. For if the Israelites are
   condemned for sparing some of these nations wholly, what are we to
   think of those judges who, from a timid and apathetic attention to the
   responsible duties of their office, exercise too much lenity to a few
   persons, thus weakening the restraints of the inlets to vice, to the
   great detriment of the public weal?

   35 But were mingled He describes what was the result of this foolish
   humanity; namely, that they were defiled with the pollutions of the
   nations whom they had spared. Had they exclusively inhabited the land
   of Canaan, they would have more easily retained the pure worship of
   God. Allured by the influence of such neighbors, it is not wonderful
   that they soon degenerated from the footsteps of their fathers, for we
   are more inclined to follow the example of the bad than of the good.
   And now he speaks of the descendants of those who had so frequently
   provoked God's anger in the wilderness, and declares, that as the same
   unbelief, rebellion, and ingratitude, were rampant in the succeeding
   race, they were no better than their fathers.

   In mingling with the heathens they openly rejected the distinguishing
   loving-kindness of God, who adopted them as his children, under the
   express condition that they should be separated from these profane
   nations. Therefore, in associating with them indiscriminately, they
   render this holy covenant of no effect. When he adds, that they learned
   their works, he warns us, that nothing is more dangerous than
   associating with the ungodly; because, being more prone to follow vice
   than virtue, it cannot but be, that the more conversant we are with
   corruption, the more widely will it spread. In such circumstances, the
   utmost care and caution are requisite, lest the wicked, with whom we
   come into contact, infect us by their vitiated morals; and particularly
   where there is danger of relapsing into idolatry, to which we are all
   naturally prone. What, then, will be the effect produced upon us when
   instigated by others to commit sin, but to add sin to sin? [267] The
   prophet, therefore, declares that the Jews were already so much under
   the tuition of the heathen as to abandon themselves to the practice of
   their idolatrous rites. In employing the word to serve, he confutes the
   contemptible evasion of the Papists, who pretend that they do not give
   to images the worship that is due to God alone, but only a sort of
   honorary adoration. [268] But if the worshipping of images be lawful,
   the prophet had no sufficient cause to condemn his own nation for
   serving strange gods. Despicable, therefore, is the distinction, that
   Divine homage is to be paid to God alone, and that a kind of honorary
   adoration is to be given to images. He adds, that this issued in their
   overthrow, in order that their obstinate attachment to their follies,
   and their despising the chastisements of God, may more palpably appear.

   37. And they sacrificed The prophet here mentions one species of
   superstition which demonstrates the awful blindness of the people;
   their not hesitating to sacrifice their sons and daughters to devils.
   [269] In applying such an abominable designation to the sin of the
   people, he means to exhibit it in more hateful colors. From this we
   learn that inconsiderate zeal is a flimsy pretext in favor of any act
   of devotion. For by how much the Jews were under the influence of
   burning zeal, by so much does the prophet convict them with being
   guilty of greater wickedness; because their madness carried them away
   to such a pitch of enthusiasm, that they did not spare even their own
   offspring. Were good intentions meritorious, as idolaters suppose, then
   indeed the laying aside of all natural affection in sacrificing their
   own children was a deed deserving of the highest praise. But when men
   act under the impulse of their own capricious humor, the more they
   occupy themselves with acts of external worship, the more do they
   increase their guilt. For what difference was there between Abraham and
   those persons of whom the prophet makes mention, but that the former,
   under the influence of faith, was ready to offer up his son, while the
   latter, carried away by the impulse of intemperate zeal, cast off all
   natural affection, and imbrued their hands in the blood of their own
   offspring.

   38. And they shed He inveighs with still greater indignation against
   that religious phrensy which led them to sacrifice their own children,
   and thus to pollute the land by the shedding of innocent blood. Should
   any one object that Abraham is praised, because he did not withhold his
   only son, the answer is plain, That he did it in obedience to God's
   command, so that every vestige of inhumanity was effaced by means of
   the purity of faith. For if obedience is better than sacrifice, (1
   Samuel 15:22) it is the best rule both for morality and religion. It is
   an awful manifestation of God's vindictive wrath, when the
   superstitious heathens, left to their own inventions, become hardened
   in deeds of horrid cruelty. As often as the martyrs put their life in
   jeopardy in defense of the truth, the incense of such a sacrifice is
   pleasing to God. But when the two Romans, by name Decii, [270] in an
   execrable manner devoted themselves unto death, that was an act of
   atrocious impiety. It is not without just cause, therefore, that the
   prophet enhances the guilt of the people by this consideration, that to
   the perverse mode of worshipping God, they had added excessive cruelty.
   Nor is there less cause for charging them with having polluted that
   land out of which God had commanded them to expel the ancient
   inhabitants, in order that he might render it the peculiar scene where
   he was to be worshipped. The Israelites then were doubly wicked, who,
   by not only defiling the land with their idolatry, but also by cruelly
   butchering their children, robbed God of his due, and in a manner
   frustrated his designs.

   39 And they were polluted with their own works He now concludes by
   stating generally, that the Jews, in adopting the abominable practices
   of the heathen, were become wholly filthy; because in all the devices
   of men there is nothing else than impurity. He denominates as the works
   of men all the false worship which they devise without the Divine
   sanction; as if he should say, that the holiness, which is truly
   connected with the worship of God, comes from his word, and that all
   human inventions and admixtures in religion are profane, and tend to
   corrupt the service of God. Doubtless it was the intention of the
   Israelites to serve God, but the Holy Spirit declares that all the
   fruit of their burning zeal was their becoming more abominable in God's
   sight by their lewd inventions. For a strict adherence to the word of
   God constitutes spiritual chastity.

   Psalm 106:40-46

   40. And the wrath of Jehovah waxed hot against his people, and he
   abhorred his own inheritance: 41. And he delivered them into the hands
   of the heathen; and their enemies ruled over them. 42. And their
   adversaries subdued them, and they were afflicted under their hand. 43.
   Many times he delivered them; and they provoked him with their counsel,
   and were oppressed by their iniquity. 44. And he saw when they were in
   straits, in that he heard their cry: 45. And he remembered his covenant
   towards them, and it repented him according to the greatness of his
   mercies. 46. And he made them to find pity from those who had carried
   them away captive.


   40. And the wrath of Jehovah waxed hot. The severity of the punishment
   inflicted upon the people confirms the truth of what we formerly said,
   that they had been guilty of no trivial offense, in presuming to
   corrupt the worship of God. And they themselves showed how hopeless
   their reformation was, in that all this as yet failed to bring them
   truly to repent of their sin. That the people, who were God's sacred
   and chosen heritage, were delivered up to the abominations of the
   heathen, who themselves were the slaves of the devil, was an awful
   manifestation of his vindictive wrath. Then, at least, ought they to
   have held in abhorrence their own wickedness, by which they had been
   precipitated into such direful calamities. In saying, that they were
   subdued and afflicted by their enemies, the prophet points out, in a
   still more astonishing manner, the baseness of their conduct. Reduced
   to a state of bondage and oppression, their folly appears the more
   disgraceful, in that they were not truly and heartily humbled under
   God's almighty hand. For prior to this, they had been warned by Moses,
   that they had not casually fallen into that bondage so galling to them,
   neither had it happened by the valor of their enemies, but because they
   were given over, and, as it were, sold to it by God himself. That those
   who had refused to bear his yoke, should be delivered up to tyrants to
   harass and oppress them, and that those who would not endure to be
   ruled by God's paternal sway, should be subdued by their enemies, to be
   trodden under their feet, is a striking example of God's retributive
   justice.

   43. Many times. As the wicked perversity of the people was manifested
   in that God's severe chastisements failed to produce their reformation,
   so now, on the other hand, the prophet deduces the detestable hardness
   of their hearts from the fact, that all the benefits which they had
   received from God could not bend them into obedience. They did, indeed,
   in the time of their afflictions, groan under the burden of them; but
   when God not only mitigated their punishment, but also granted them
   wonderful deliverances, can their subsequent backsliding be excused? It
   becomes us to bear in mind, that here, as in a glass, we have a picture
   of the nature of all mankind; for let God but adopt those very means
   which he employed in relation to the Israelites, in order to reclaim
   the majority of the sons of men, how comparatively few are there who
   will not be found continuing in the very same state as they were? And
   if he either humble us by the severity of his rod, or melt us by his
   kindness, the effect is only temporary; because, though he visit us
   with correction upon correction, and heap kindness upon kindness, yet
   we very soon relapse into our wonted vicious practices. As for the
   Jews, their insensate stupidity was insufferable, in that,
   notwithstanding the many and magnificent deliverances which God wrought
   out for them, they did not cease from their backslidings. For the
   Psalmist says, that they, nevertheless, provoked God with their wicked
   inventions Then he declares that they received a just recompense of
   reward in being oppressed by their iniquity. Moreover, he informs us,
   that though they were most deserving of all their afflictions, yet
   their groanings were heard; whence we learn, that God, in his unwearied
   kindness, did not cease to strive with them on account of their
   perverseness of spirit.

   For what pity was this, to hear the cry of those who turned a deaf ear
   to his wise instructions, and were regardless of all his warnings and
   threatenings? And yet after all this forbearance and long-suffering,
   their exceedingly depraved hearts remained unchanged.

   45. And he remembered God's being mindful of his covenant is here
   assigned as the cause of his great mercy and long-suffering. In that
   covenant, he not only declares that there is a gracious pardon for
   transgressions, but he also adverts to the perverse blindness of those
   who were not brought back by such remedies to the covenant, in which
   they were well aware that their safety was placed. But above all, he
   charges them with ingratitude; because, when deserving to perish, they
   did not acknowledge that they were indebted to the mercy of God alone
   for their preservation. This observation is strengthened by the next
   clause of the verse, in which he says that God had spared them
   according to the greatness of his mercies For the greatness of the
   punishment which their sins deserved, may be inferred from the great
   treasures of his loving-kindness, which God had to open in order to
   procure their redemption. The word to repent expresses no change in
   God, but only in the mode of administering his corrections. It may seem
   as if God altered his purpose, when he mitigates punishment, or
   withdraws his hand from executing his judgments. The Scripture,
   however, accommodating itself to our weak and limited capacity, speaks
   only after the manner of men.

   46. And he made them to find pity As he had above said, that the Jews
   had been delivered into the hands of their enemies, because God's anger
   was, as it were, arms to their adversaries to subdue them; so now he
   says, that the same God had softened the hearts of these very enemies,
   who, by terrible means, and with great cruelty, had executed his
   vengeance upon them. As, then, the hearts of all men are entirely under
   God's control, to harden or to soften them according to his sovereign
   pleasure, so, while his anger was kindled against his people, their
   enemies were at the same time also inflamed with implacable resentment
   towards them. But the moment his anger was appeased, the fire which
   issued from the furnace of his judgment was extinguished, and the
   cruelty of their enemies was changed into mercy. And that enemies,
   cruel and barbarous, should begin to love and pity those whom they
   formerly hated, was a change so astonishing as to be incredible, had
   they not, in the kind providence of God, from wolves been transformed
   into lambs.

   Psalm 106:47-48

   47. Save us, O Jehovah our God! and gather us from among the heathen,
   to praise thy holy name, and to glory in thy praise. 48. Blessed be
   Jehovah, the God of Israel, for ever and ever; and let all the people
   say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah. [271]


   47. Save us, Jehovah our God! From the conclusion of the psalm, it is
   evident, that it was composed during the sad and calamitous dispersion
   of the people. And although subsequent to the times of Haggai and
   Malachi, no famous prophets appeared among the people, it is
   nevertheless probable that some of the priests were endued with the
   spirit of prophecy, in order that they might direct them to the source
   whence they might receive all needful consolation. It is my opinion,
   that after they were dispersed by the tyranny of Antiochus, this form
   of prayer was adapted to the exigency of their existing circumstances,
   in which the people, by reflecting upon their former history, might
   acknowledge that their fathers had, in ways innumerable, provoked God
   to wrath, since the time he had delivered them. For it was needful for
   them to be completely humbled, to prevent them from murmuring against
   God's dispensations. And seeing that God had extended pardon to their
   fathers though undeserving of it, that was calculated to inspire them
   hereafter with the hope of forgiveness, provided they carefully and
   cordially sought to be reconciled to him; and especially is this the
   case, because there is here a solemn remembrance of the covenant,
   through the faith of which they might draw near to God, though his
   anger was not yet turned away. Besides, as God had chosen them to be
   his peculiar people, they call upon him to collect into one body the
   dissevered and bleeding members, according to the prediction of Moses,

   "If any of thine be driven out unto the utmost parts of heaven, from
   thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch
   thee," Deuteronomy 30:4

   This prediction was at length accomplished, when the widely separated
   multitude were gathered together, and grew up in the unity of the
   faith. For although that people never regained their earthly kingdom
   and polity, yet their being grafted into the body of Christ, was a more
   preferable gathering together. Wherever they were, they were united to
   each other, and also to the Gentile converts, by the holy and spiritual
   bond of faith, so that they constituted but one Church, extending
   itself over the whole earth. They subjoin the end contemplated by their
   redemption from captivity, namely, that they might celebrate the name
   of God, and employ themselves continually in his praises.

   48. Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel The prophet here regulates
   the prayers and desires of the people in such a way, as that, amid
   their grievous oppression, the dejected captives may not cease to
   render thanks to God; and this is a matter which must be carefully
   attended to, because, when borne down by adversity, there is scarcely
   one among a hundred, who, with composure of spirit, draws near to God;
   but, on the contrary, he betrays the pride of his heart by the careless
   and insipid manner in which he prays, or in pouring out complaints
   about his afflicted condition. But the only way in which we can expect
   God to lend a favorable ear to the voice of our supplications is, in
   the spirit of meekness to submit to his corrections, and patiently to
   bear the cross which he is pleased to lay upon us. It is with great
   propriety then, that the prophet exhorts the afflicted captives to
   bless God, even when he was chastising them with considerable severity.
   It is to the same purpose that it is added, let the people say, Amen;
   as if he were commanding them all to consent to the praises of God,
   though both privately and publicly they were overwhelmed in a sea of
   troubles.

   [271] The Hebrew for "Praise ye Jehovah," is hllv-yh, Haleluyah, -- a
   word which occurs very frequently at the beginning and end of psalms.
   The LXX., leaving it untranslated, have Allelouia. From this solemn
   form of praise to God, which no doubt was far more ancient than the
   time of David, the ancient Greeks plainly had their similar
   acclamation, Allelouia, with which they both began and ended their
   poems or hymns in honor of Apollo. -- See Parkhurst's Lexicon on hll,

   Psalms have been divided by the Jews.

   [237] The first and two last verses of this psalm form a part of that
   psalm which David delivered into the hand of Asaph and his brethren, to
   be sung before the ark of the covenant, after it was brought from the
   house of Obed-edom to mount Zion. See 1 Chronicles 16:34-36. Hence it
   has been ascribed to the pen of David. Many of the ancients thought,
   and they are followed by Horsley and Mudge, that it was written during
   the captivity; resting their opinion chiefly on verse 47; but as that
   verse occurs in the psalm of David recorded in 1 Chronicles 16, at the
   35th verse, this argument is clearly without force.

   PSALM 107

   The Psalmist teaches us, in the first place, that human affairs are not
   regulated by the fickle and uncertain wheel of fortune, but that we
   must observe the judgments of God in the different vicissitudes which
   occur in the world, and which men imagine happen by chance.
   Consequently, adversity and all the ills which mankind endure, as
   shipwrecks, famines, banishments, diseases, and disasters in war, are
   to be regarded as so many tokens of God's displeasure, by which he
   summons them, on account of their sins, before his judicial throne. But
   prosperity, and the happy issue of events, ought also to be attributed
   to his grace, in order that he may always receive the praise which he
   deserves, that of being a merciful Father, and an impartial Judge.
   About the close of the psalm, he inveighs against those ungodly men who
   will not acknowledge God's hand, amid such palpable demonstrations of
   his providence. [272]

   Psalm 107:1-9

   1. Praise Jehovah, because he is good: because his mercy endureth for
   ever. 2. Let the redeemed of Jehovah say this, [273] whom he hath
   redeemed out of the hand of the afflicted. [274] 3. Whom he hath
   gathered out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the
   north, and from the south. [275] 4. They wandered from the way in the
   solitary desert, [276] they did not find a city of habitation. 5. Both
   hungry and thirsty, so that their soul fainted within them. 6. In their
   straits they called upon Jehovah, and he delivered them from all their
   afflictions. 7. And he directed them by a right way, that they might
   come to a city of habitation. 8. Let them praise the mercy of Jehovah
   in his prescience, and his marvelous works in the presence of the sons
   of men. 9. Because he hath satisfied the longing soul, and hath filled
   the hungry soul with goodness.


   1 Praise Jehovah. We have already explained this verse, for it formed
   the commencement of the preceding psalm. And it appears that it was not
   only frequently used among the Jews, but also so incorporated with
   other psalms, that when one part of the chorus on the one side was
   singing a portion of the psalm, the other part of the chorus on the
   opposite side in its turn, after each succeeding verse, responded,
   Praise Jehovah, because he is good, etc The penman of this psalm,
   whoever he was, has, instead of the ordinary preface, inserted this
   beautiful sentiment, in which praise and thanksgiving to God were so
   frequently expressed by the Israelitish Church. Immediately he proceeds
   to speak more particularly. And first, he exhorts those to offer up a
   tribute of gratitude to God; who, after having been delivered from
   slavery and imprisonment, and after a long and painful journey, arrived
   in safety at their place of abode. These he calls the redeemed of God;
   because, in wandering through the trackless desert, and howling
   wilderness, they many a time would have been prevented from returning
   home, had not God, as it were, with his outstretched hand, appeared as
   their guard and their guide. He does not here refer to travelers
   indiscriminately, but to such as either by hostile power, or by any
   other kind of violence, or by stern necessity, having been banished to
   distant regions, felt themselves to be in the midst of imminent
   dangers; or it may be, that he refers to those who had been made
   prisoners by enemies, pirates, or other robbers. He reminds them that
   it was by no casual occurrence that they had been driven about in that
   manner, and had been brought back to their native country, but that all
   their wanderings had been under the superintending providence of God.

   But the second verse might be conjoined with the first, as if the
   prophet were commanding the persons whom he was addressing to sing this
   celebrated ode. It may with equal propriety be read by itself thus: Let
   the redeemed of Jehovah, who have returned from captivity to their own
   land, come forth now, and take part in the celebration of God's
   praises, and let them publish his loving-kindness which they have
   experienced in their deliverance. Among the Jews, who had occasion to
   undertake extensive journeys, such occurrences as these were very
   common; because they could hardly leave their own land, without from
   all quarters encountering ways rugged, and difficult, and perilous; and
   the same observation is equally applicable to mankind in general. He
   reminds them how often they wandered and turned aside from the right
   way, and found no place of shelter; a thing by no means rare in these
   lonely deserts. Were a person to enter a forest without any knowledge
   of the proper direction, he would, in the course of his wandering, be
   in danger of becoming the prey of lions and wolves. He has, however,
   particularly in his eye those who, finding themselves unexpectedly in
   desert places, are also in danger of perishing for hunger and thirst.
   For it is certain that such persons are hourly in hazard of death,
   unless the Lord come to their rescue.

   6 In their straits they called upon Jehovah The verbs are here in the
   past tense, and according to grammarians, represent a continued action.
   The meaning therefore is, that those who are wandering in desert places
   are often pinched with hunger and thirst in consequence of finding no
   place in which to lodge; and who, when all hope of deliverance fails
   them, then cry unto God. Doubtless, God grants deliverance to many when
   in straits, even though they do not present their supplications to Him
   for aid; and hence it was not so much the design of the prophet in this
   passage to extol the faith of the pious, who call upon God with all
   their heart, as to describe the common feelings of humanity. There may
   be not a few whose hope does not center on God, who, nevertheless, are
   constrained, by some invisible disposition of mind, to come to Him,
   when under the pressure of dire necessity. And this is the plan which
   God sometimes pursues, in order to extort from such persons the
   acknowledgement that deliverance is to be sought for from no other
   quarter than from Himself alone; and even the ungodly, who, while
   living voluptuously, scoff at Him, he constrains, in spite of
   themselves, to invoke his name. It has been customary in all ages for
   heathens, who look upon religion as a fable, when compelled by stern
   necessity, to call upon God for help. Did they do so in jest? By no
   means; it was by a secret natural instinct that they were led to
   reverence God's name, which formerly they held in derision. The Spirit
   of God, therefore, in my opinion, here narrates what frequently takes
   place, namely, that persons destitute of piety and faith, and who have
   no desire to have any thing to do with God, if placed in perilous
   circumstances, are constrained by natural instinct, and without any
   proper conception of what they are doing, to call on the name of God.
   Since it is only in dubious and desperate cases that they betake
   themselves to God, this acknowledgement which they make of their
   helplessness is a palpable proof of their stupidity, that in the season
   of peace and tranquillity they neglect him, so much are they then under
   the intoxicating influence of their own prosperity; and notwithstanding
   that the germ of piety is planted in their hearts, they nevertheless
   never dream of learning wisdom, unless when driven by the dint of
   adversity; I mean, to learn the wisdom of acknowledging that there is a
   God in heaven who directs every event. It is unnecessary to allude here
   to the sarcastic retort of the ancient buffoon, who, on entering a
   temple, and beholding a number of tablets which several merchants had
   suspended there as memorials of their having escaped shipwreck, through
   the kind interposition of the gods, smartly and facetiously remarked,
   "But the deaths of those who have been drowned are not enumerated, the
   number of which is innumerable." Perhaps he might have some just cause
   for scoffing in this manner at such idols. But even if a hundredfold
   more were drowned in the sea than safely reach the harbour, this does
   not in the least degree detract from the glory of the goodness of God,
   who, while he is merciful, is at the same time also just, so that the
   dispensing of the one does not interfere with the exercise of the
   other. The same observation applies to travelers that stray from the
   path, and wander up and down in the desert. If many of them perish for
   hunger and thirst, if many are devoured by wild animals, if many die
   from cold, these are nothing else than so many tokens of the judgments
   of God, which he designs for our consideration. From which we infer
   that the same thing would happen to all men, were it not the will of
   God to save a portion of them; and thus interposing as a judge between
   them, he preserves some for the sake of showing his mercy, and pours
   out his judgments upon others to declare his justice. The prophet,
   therefore, very properly adds, that by the hand of God they were led
   into the right way, where they may find a suitable place for lodging;
   and consequently he exhorts them to render thanks to God for this
   manifestation of his goodness. And with the view of enhancing the
   loving-kindness of God, he connects his wondrous works with his mercy;
   as if he should say, in this kind interposition, God's grace is too
   manifest, either to be unperceived or unacknowledged by all; and for
   those who have been the subjects of such a remarkable deliverance, to
   remain silent regarding it, would be nothing less than an impious
   attempt to suppress the wonderful doings of God, an attempt equally
   vain with that of endeavoring to trample under their feet the light of
   the sun. For what else can be said of us, seeing that our natural
   instinct drives us to God for help, when we are in perplexity and
   peril; and when, after being rescued, we forthwith forget him, who will
   deny that his glory is, as it were, obscured by our wickedness and
   ingratitude?

   Psalm 107:10-16

   10. They who dwell in darkness, and in the shadow of death, being bound
   in trouble and iron; 11. Because they rebelled against the words of
   God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High: 12. When he humbled
   their heart with affliction; they were brought low, and there was none
   to help them. 13. In their affliction they cried to Jehovah, and he
   delivered them from their tribulations. 14. He rescued them from
   darkness and from the shadow of death, and broke off their chains. 15.
   Let them praise the mercy of Jehovah in his presence, and his marvelous
   works in the presence of the sons of men. 16. Because he hath broken
   the brazen gates, and dashed in pieces the iron bars. [277]


   10. They who dwell in darkness The Spirit of God makes mention here of
   another species of danger in which God manifestly discovers his power
   and grace in the protecting and delivering of men. The world, as I
   said, calls these vicissitudes the sport of fortune; and hardly one
   among a hundred can be found who ascribes them to the superintending
   providence of God. It is a very different kind of practical wisdom
   which God expects at our hands; namely, that we ought to meditate on
   his judgments in the time of adversity, and on his goodness in
   delivering us from it. For surely it is not by mere chance that a
   person falls into the hands of enemies or robbers; neither is it by
   chance that he is rescued from them. But this is what we must
   constantly keep in view, that all afflictions are God's rod, and that
   therefore there is no remedy for them elsewhere than in his grace. If a
   person fall into the hands of robbers or pirates, and be not instantly
   murdered, but, giving up all hope of life, expects death every moment;
   surely the deliverance of such a one is a striking proof of the grace
   of God, which shines the more illustriously in proportion to the
   fewness of the number who make their escape. Thus, then, should a great
   number perish, this circumstance ought by no means to diminish the
   praises of God. On this account the prophet charges all those with
   ingratitude, who, after they have been wonderfully preserved, very soon
   lose sight of the deliverance thus vouchsafed to them. And, to
   strengthen the charge, he brings forward, as a testimony against them,
   their sighs and cries. For when they are in straits, they confess in
   good earnest that God is their deliverer; how happens it, then, that
   this confession disappears when they are enjoying peace and quietness?

   11. Because they rebelled In assigning the cause of their afflictions
   he corrects the false impressions of those persons who imagine that
   these happen by chance. Were they to reflect on the judgments of God,
   they would at once perceive that there was nothing like chance or
   fortune in the government of the world. Moreover, until men are
   persuaded that all their troubles come upon them by the appointment of
   God, it will never come into their minds to supplicate him for
   deliverance. Farther, when the prophet assigns the reason for their
   afflictions, he is not to be regarded as speaking of those persons as
   if they were notoriously wicked, but he is to be considered as calling
   upon the afflicted carefully to examine some particular parts of their
   life, and although no one accuse them, to look into their hearts, where
   they will always discover the true origin of all the miseries which
   overtake them. Nor does he only charge them with having merely sinned,
   but with having rebelled against the word of God, thus intimating that
   the best and only regulation for our lives consists in yielding a
   prompt obedience to his commandments. When, therefore, sheer necessity
   compels those who are in this manner convicted to cry unto God, they
   must be insensate indeed, if they do not acknowledge that the
   deliverance which, contrary to their expectation, they receive, comes
   immediately from God. For brazen gates and iron bars are spoken of for
   the purpose of enhancing the benefit; as if he said, the chains of
   perpetual slavery have been broken asunder.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [277] To secure the gates of cities, it is customary in the East, at
   the present day, to cover them with thick plates of brass and iron.
   Maundrell speaks of the enormous gates of the principal mosque at
   Damascus, formerly the Church of St John the Baptist, being plated over
   with brass. Pitts informs us, that Algiers has five gates, and some of
   these have two, some three, other gates within them; and that some of
   them are plated all over with thick iron, being made strong and
   convenient for what it is -- a nest of pirates. -- Harmer's
   Observations, volume 1, page 329. To such a practice, which, in all
   probability, obtained in ancient times, there seems to be here a
   reference. From this verse some have been inclined to think that the
   psalm was written after the return of the Jews from the Babylonish
   captivity. This deliverance was predicted, in precisely the same terms,
   in that remarkable passage, where God promises to go before Cyrus his
   anointed, and "break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder
   the bars of iron," (Isaiah 45:2) This phraseology appropriately
   expresses the superior and almost impregnable strength of Babylon.
   "Abydenus, quoted by Eusebius in his Praeparatio Evangelica, says that
   the wall of Babylon had brazen gates. And Herodotus more particularly,
   -- In the wall all around there are a hundred gates all of brass; and
   so, in like manner, are the sides and the lintels.' The gates likewise
   within the city, opening to the river from the several streets, were of
   brass: as were those also of the Temple of Belus." -- (Lowth on Isaiah
   45:2) But still these brazen gates could not secure the city and the
   empire from falling into the hands of the instrument chosen by God for
   the deliverance of his people.

   Psalm 107:17-22

   17. Fools are afflicted on account of the way of their transgression,
   and by reason of their iniquities. 18. Their soul loatheth all food;
   [278] and they approach the gates of death. 19. Then they cry unto
   Jehovah in their tribulation; He saves them from their straits. 20. He
   sendeth his word, and healeth them, and rescues them from all their
   corruptions. [279] 21. Let them praise the mercy of Jehovah in his
   presence, and his marvelous works in the presence of the sons of men.
   22. And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of praise, and declare his
   works with rejoicings.


   17 Fools are afflicted on account of the way of their transgression. He
   comes to another species of chastisement. For as he observed above,
   that those were given over to captivity who refused to yield obedience
   to God, so now he teaches that others have been visited by God with
   disease, as the fruit of their transgressions. And when the
   transgressor shall find that it is God who is administering correction
   to him, this will pave the way for his arriving at the knowledge of his
   grace.

   He denominates those fools, who, thoughtlessly giving themselves up to
   sensuality, bring destruction upon themselves. The sin which they
   commit is not the result of ignorance and error only, but of their
   carnal affections, which depriving them of proper understanding, cause
   them to devise things detrimental to themselves. The maxim, that the
   fear of God is wisdom, must never be lost sight of. Hence it plainly
   follows, that they who shake off the yoke of God, and surrender
   themselves to Satan and sin, are the victims of their own folly and
   fury. And as constituting a principal ingredient of this madness, the
   prophet employs the term deletion or transgression; and subsequently he
   adds iniquities; because it happens that when once a man departs from
   God, from that moment he loses all self-control, and falls from one sin
   into another. But it is not of the distempers which commonly prevail in
   the world to which a reference is made in this passage, but to those
   which are deemed fatal, and in which all hope of life is abandoned, so
   that the grace of God becomes the more conspicuous when deliverance
   from them is obtained. When a man recovers from a slight indisposition,
   he does not so plainly discern the effects of God's power, as when it
   is put forth in a wonderful and notable manner to bring back some from
   the gates of death, and restores them to their wonted health and
   rigour. He says, therefore, that they are preserved from many
   corruptions, which is equivalent to his saying, that they are delivered
   from as many deaths. To this purport are the following words of the
   prophet, in which he says, that they approach the gates of death, and
   that they loathe all food We have already adverted to their calling
   upon God, namely, that when men are reduced to the greatest straits,
   they, by thus calling upon God for aid, acknowledge that they would be
   undone unless he wonderfully interposed for their deliverance.

   20 He sendeth his word. Again, in saying that they are delivered from
   destruction, the prophet shows that he is here alluding to those
   diseases which, in the opinion of men, are incurable, and from which
   few are delivered. Besides, he contrasts God's assistance with all the
   remedies which are in the power of man to apply; as if he should say,
   that their disease having baffled the skill of earthly physicians,
   their recovery has been entirely owing to the exertion of God's power.
   It is proper also to notice the manner in which their recovery is
   effected; God has but to will it, or to speak the word, and instantly
   all diseases, and even death itself, are expelled. I do not regard this
   as exclusively referring to the faithful, as many expositors do. I own,
   indeed, that it is of comparatively little consequence to us to be the
   subjects of bodily care, if our souls still remain unsanctified by the
   word of God; and hence it is the intention of the prophet that we
   consider the mercy of God as extending to the evil and unthankful. The
   meaning of the passage, therefore, is, that diseases neither come upon
   us by chance, nor are to be ascribed to natural causes alone, but are
   to be viewed as God's messengers executing his commands; so that we
   must believe that the same person that sent them can easily remove
   them, and for this purpose he has only to speak the word. And since we
   now perceive the drift of the passage, we ought to attend to the very
   appropriate analogy contained in it. Corporeal maladies are not removed
   except by the word or command of God, much less are men's souls
   restored to the enjoyment of spiritual life, except this word be
   apprehended by faith.

   And let them sacrifice This clause is subjoined by way of explanation,
   the more strongly to express how God is robbed of his due, if in the
   matter of sacrifice his providence be not recognised. Even nature
   itself teaches that some kind of homage and reverence is due to God;
   this is acknowledged by the heathens themselves, who have no other
   instructor than nature. We know too, that the practice of offering
   sacrifices has obtained among all nations; and doubtless it was by the
   observance of this ritual, that God designed to preserve in the human
   family some sense of piety and religion. To acknowledge the bounty and
   beneficence of God, is the most acceptable sacrifice which can be
   presented to him; to this subject, therefore, the prophet intends to
   recall the attention of the insensate and indifferent portion of men. I
   do not deny that there may be also an allusion to the ceremonial law;
   but inasmuch as in the world at large sacrifices formed part of the
   religious exercises, he charges those with ingratitude, who, after
   having escaped from some imminent peril, forget to celebrate the
   praises of their Great Deliverer.

   Psalm 107:23-32

   23. They [280] that go down to the sea in ships, trading in the great
   waters, 24. See the works of Jehovah, his wonders in the deep. 25. He
   speaks, and raiseth the stormy wind, and causeth the billows thereof to
   mount on high. 26. They mount up to the heavens, they descend into the
   deeps; their soul breaketh because of trouble. 27. They are tossed and
   totter like a drunken man, and all their senses are overwhelmed. [281]
   And they cry to Jehovah in their straits, [282] and he rescues them
   from their troubles. 29. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves
   thereof are still. 30. And they rejoice because they are calmed; and he
   brings them to the coast which they desired. 31. Let them celebrate the
   mercy of Jehovah in his presence, and his wonders among the sons of
   men; 32. And let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, and
   praise him in the assembly of the elders. [283]


   23. They that go down to the sea in ships Here we have another instance
   of God's superintending care towards mankind pointed out to us by the
   prophet, exemplified in the bringing of those who are shipwrecked to
   the harbour, and this, too, as if he had raised them from the depth and
   darkness of the tomb, and brought them to live in the light of day. I
   do not understand what is here said about those who are accustomed to
   navigate the ocean seeing the wonders of God, as referring generally to
   the many wonderful things with which it abounds. Such persons are well
   fitted to bear testimony regarding the works of God, because they there
   behold more vast and various wonders than are to be seen upon earth.
   But it appears to me preferable to connect this with the subsequent
   context, where the prophet is his own interpreter, and where he shows
   how suddenly God raises and calms the tempest.

   The sum of the matter is, that the scope of the passage is to point out
   that the lives of those who navigate the seas are often in great
   jeopardy by the storms which they encounter; because, as often as the
   ocean heaves and is agitated, and the billows rise and rage, so often
   does death stare them in the face. But he furnishes us with a still
   more vivid picture of the providence of God; for in telling us, that
   the sea does not of its own accord rise into a tempest, he makes use of
   the verb, he speaks, intimating that the word and providence of God
   make the winds blow, to agitate the sea. True, indeed, the mariners
   imagine from certain phenomena, that a storm is approaching, but sudden
   changes proceed only from the secret appointment of God. Therefore, he
   gives not merely a historical narrative of the manner in which squalls
   and storms arise, but, assuming the character of a teacher, begins with
   the cause itself, and then directs to the imminent danger with which
   the tempest is fraught; or rather, portrays, as in a picture, the image
   of death, in order that the goodness of God may appear the more
   conspicuous when the tempest happily ceases without any loss of life.
   They mount up, says he, to the heavens, they descend into the deeps; as
   if he should say, they mount up into the air, so that their life may be
   destroyed, and then they tumble down towards the caverns of the ocean,
   where they may be drowned. [284] Next, he mentions the fears which
   torment them, or rather which may deprive them of understanding;
   intimating by these words, that however skilfully mariners may steer
   their vessels, they may happen to be deprived of their senses; and
   being thus paralysed, they could not avail themselves of aid, were it
   even at hand. For though they collect all their tackling, cast their
   sounding line into the deep, and unfurl their sails to all points, yet
   after making every attempt, and all human skill is baffled, they give
   themselves up to the mercy of wind and wave. All hope of safety being
   cut off, no farther means are employed by them. And now that all human
   aid fails, they cry unto God for deliverance, which is a convincing
   evidence that they had been as it were dead. [285]

   29. He maketh the storm a calm A profane author, in narrating the
   history of such an event, would have said, that the winds were hushed,
   and the raging billows were calmed; but the Spirit of God, by this
   change of the storm into a calm, places the providence of God as
   presiding over all; thereby meaning, that it was not by human agency
   that this violent commotion of the sea and wind, which threatened to
   subvert the frame of the world, was so suddenly stilled. When,
   therefore, the sea is agitated, and boils up in terrific fury, as if
   wave were contending with wave, whence is it that instantly it is calm
   and peaceful, but that God restrains the raging of the billows, the
   contention of which was so awful, and makes the bosom of the deep as
   smooth as a mirror? [286] Having spoken of their great terror, he
   proceeds next to mention their joy, so that their ingratitude may
   appear the more striking, if they forget their remarkable deliverance.
   For they are not in want of a monitor, having been abundantly
   instructed by the storm itself, and by the calm which ensued, that
   their lives were in the hand and under the protection of God. Moreover,
   he informs them that this is a species of gratitude which deserves not
   only to be acknowledged privately, or to be mentioned in the family,
   but that it should be praised and magnified in all places, even in the
   great assemblies. He makes specific mention of the elders, intimating
   that the more wisdom and experience a person has, the more capable is
   he of listening to, and being a witness of, these praises.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [280] This psalm is distinguished for beautiful and inimitable
   description. In the preceding part of it, the weary and bewildered
   traveler, -- the forlorn and wretched captive, shut up in the dungeon
   and bound in fetters, -- the sick and dying man, -- are painted in the
   most striking and affecting manner. In this verse there is a transition
   to ships, and the dangers of mariners foundering in a storm, which is
   continued to the close of the 30th verse. This has often been admired
   as one of the sublimest descriptions of a sea-storm anywhere to be
   found, either in the Sacred Writings, or in profane authors.

   [281] Horsley reads, "And all their skill is drowned;" "that is," says
   he, "their skill in the art of navigation is drowned; a metaphor taken
   from the particular danger which threatens them." Phillips reads, And
   all their wisdom is absorbed or swallowed up; which, in like manner, he
   explains as denoting that "their alarm is so great, that their
   knowledge deserts them; they lose all self-possession, and become
   entirely unfit for managing the ship."

   [282] Instead of in their straits, Phillips reads, from their
   prison-houses, places of confinement. "By their prison-houses," says
   he, "we understand the ship in which they were confined; to be
   liberated from which, and consequently from the risk of a watery grave,
   they cried unto the Lord."

   [283] "m, the people, is here evidently opposed to zqnym, elders, and
   both signify the whole assembly or congregation. For, among the Jews,
   the doctors, rulers of the synagogue, and elders, had a distinct
   apartment from the people, and the service being much in antiphona, or
   response, part was spoken by them that officiated in the seat of the
   elders, and the rest by the multitude of common men, the idiotai, that
   answered Amen at least, at their giving of thanks." -- Hammond.

   [284] "The men of the ship go up to heaven, i.e., rise high in the air
   when the wave lifteth up the ship, and afterwards, because of the wave
   they descend to the deep; and from thus ascending and descending, the
   soul of the men of the ship melteth within them on account of the
   danger in which they are placed." -- Kimchi.

   [285] The consternation into which those at sea are thrown in a
   dangerous storm, and their deliverance by God in answer to prayer, is
   so beautifully described in the well known and admirable hymn of
   Addison, that we shall take the liberty to quote a part of it: "Think,
   O my soul! devoutly think,
   How with affrighted eyes,
   Thou saw'st the wide-extended deep,
   In all its horrors rise. "Confusion dwelt on every face,
   And fear in every heart;
   When waves on waves, and gulfs on gulfs,
   O'ercame the pilot's art. "Yet then, from all my griefs, O Lord,
   Thy mercy set me free;
   Whilst in the confidence of prayer,
   My soul took hold on Thee. "For though in dreadful whirls we hung
   High in the broken wave,
   I knew Thou wert not slow to hear,
   Nor impotent to save. "The storm was laid, the winds retir'd,
   Obedient to thy will;
   The sea that roar'd at thy command,
   At thy command was still!"

   [286] Among the circumstances selected by the prophet in this striking
   description of a storm at sea, God's agency, both in raising and
   calming it, is not to be overlooked. He is introduced as first causing,
   by His omnipotent command, the tempest to sweep over the ocean, whose
   billows are thus made to rise in furious agitation mountains high: and,
   again, as hushing the winds into a calm, and allaying the agitation of
   the waves. The description would be utterly mutilated were the special
   reference to the Divine power in such phenomena omitted. "How much more
   comfortable, as well as rational, is the system of the Psalmist, than
   the Pagan scheme in Virgil, and other poets, where one deity is
   represented as raising a storm, and another as laying it. Were we only
   to consider the sublime in this piece of poetry, what can be nobler
   than the idea it gives us of the Supreme Being, thus raising a tumult
   among the elements, and recovering them out of their confusion, thus
   troubling and becalming nature?" -- Spectator, Number 485.

   Psalm 107:33-41

   33. He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and springs of water into
   dryness; 34. A fruitful land into saltness, [287] because of the
   wickedness of those who dwell in it. 35. He turneth the desert into a
   pool of water, and the land of barrenness into springs of water. 36.
   And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may build a city of
   habitation; 37. And sow fields, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit
   of the increase. 38. And he blesses them, and they multiplied greatly;
   and he maketh not their cattle to decrease. 39. Afterwards they are
   lessened and dejected, by reason of anguish, misery, and sorrow. 40. He
   poureth contempt upon princes, and maketh them to wander in a
   wilderness, where there is no way; [288] 41. And he raiseth the
   afflicted out of misery, and maketh him families like a flock.


   33. He turneth rivers into a wilderness Here then is an account of
   changes which it would be the height of folly to attribute to chance.
   Fruitful lands become unfruitful, and barren lands assume the new
   aspect of freshness and fruitfulness. And how happens it that one
   district becomes sterile, and another becomes fat and fertile, contrary
   to what they were wont to be, but because that God pours out his wrath
   upon the inhabitants of the one, by taking his blessing from them, and
   renders the other fruitful to feed the hungry? It may be ascribed to
   the thinness of the population, that many parts of Asia and Greece,
   once exceedingly fruitful, now lie uncultivated and unproductive; but
   we must ascribe to the providence of God, which the prophet praises,
   the well authenticated fact, that in some places the earth that was
   fruitful has now become barren and parched, while others are beginning
   to be fertile.

   It is, however, not sufficient merely to observe, that these wonderful
   revolutions of the surface of the earth are the result of God's
   overruling purpose, unless we also observe, in the second place, what
   the prophet does not omit, that the earth is cursed by him on account
   of the iniquity of its inhabitants, who prove themselves to be
   undeserving of being so amply sustained by his bountiful hand. He has
   put pools and springs of water for fields or countries where there is
   an abundance of water; because moisture is required to nourish the
   plants by which fruit is produced. The term saltness is employed
   metaphorically, inasmuch as there is nothing more sterile than salt;
   hence that saying of Christ's,

   "If the salt have lost its saltness, what further purpose will it
   serve?"
   Mark 9:50

   not even indeed for barrenness. And, consequently, when men designed to
   doom any place to remain unproductive, they usually sowed it with salt.
   And probably it is in allusion to this ancient custom, that the prophet
   says that the land was covered with salt.

   35. He turneth the desert into a pool of water This change, in contrast
   with the former, places the miraculous power of God in a more luminous
   position. Because, were the fields ceasing to be so productive as in
   former times, men of the world, as was common of old, would attribute
   this to the frequent crops which exhausted their productive power. But
   whence is it that parched grounds become so fruitful, that one would
   almost say that the atmosphere, as well as the nature of the soil, had
   undergone a change, unless it be that God hath there put forth a
   wonderful display of his power and goodness? Wherefore, the prophet
   very justly says, that the deserts were turned into pools of water, so
   that populous cities may rise up in waste and uncultivated places,
   where once there was not a single cottage. For it is as improbable that
   the nature of the soil is changed, as that the course of the sun and
   stars is changed. The clause, the hungry are filled, may mean, either
   that they themselves, after considerable privations, have got what may
   supply their need, or that those poor persons, living in a country
   where they cannot longer find daily bread, being constrained to leave
   it, and to seek a new place of abode, are there bountifully supplied by
   God. I am rather disposed to think, that this clause refers to what
   frequently occurs, namely, that the famishing, whose wants the world
   refuses to supply, and who are expatriated, are comfortably
   accommodated in these desert places, where God blesses them with
   abundance. The passage which I have translated, fruit of the increase,
   is, by not a few Hebrew expositors, considered as a repetition of two
   synonymous terms, and are for supplying a copulative conjunction,
   making it, fruit and increase But it was rather the intention of the
   prophet to refer to fruit yielded annually; as if he said, the
   fertility of these regions is not temporary, or only for a few years,
   it is perennial. For tvv'vt, tebuaoth, is the term which, in the
   Hebrew, denotes full-grown fruit annually produced by the earth. And
   when he says, that the new settlers sow and plant, he gives us to
   understand, that, prior to their arrival, cultivation was unknown in
   these places, and, consequently, in becoming so unusually fertile, they
   assumed a totally different aspect. And, in fine, he adds, that it was
   entirely owing to the Divine blessing that those who were once
   oppressed with poverty and want are now daily increasing in the good
   things of this life.

   39. Afterwards they are lessened Ere I enter upon the consideration of
   the truths contained in this verse, I must make some brief verbal
   observations. Some make the word vtsr, otser, to signify tyranny, and
   certainly tsr, atsar, does signify to bear rule. But since it is used
   metaphorically for anguish, it appears to me that this is the meaning
   which is most accordant with the tenor of the passage. The last two
   words of the verse may be read as in the nominative case, as I have
   rendered them, or in the genitive, the anguish of misery and sorrow
   This lection appears to me preferable, through the anguish of misery,
   [289] and through sorrow.

   We come now to notice shortly the main things in the passage. And as we
   had formerly a description of the changes which these districts
   underwent in relation to the nature of the soil, so now we are informed
   that mankind do not for ever continue in the same condition; because
   they both decrease in number, and lose their place and property by
   being reduced by wars or by civil commotions, or by other casualties.
   Therefore, whether they are wasted by the pestilence, or are defeated
   in battle, or are cut off by intestine broils, it is manifest that both
   their rank and condition undergo alteration. And what is the occasion
   of this change, but that God withdraws his grace, which hitherto formed
   the hidden spring from which all their prosperity issued? And as there
   are a thousand casualties by which cities may be ruined, the prophet
   brings forward one species of change of all others the most palpable
   and remarkable. And since God's hand is not observed in that which
   relates to persons living in comparative obscurity, he brings into view
   princes themselves, whose name and fame will not permit any memorable
   event which befalls them to remain in obscurity. For it seems that the
   world is made on their account. When God, therefore, hurls them from
   their lofty estate, then men, aroused as it were from their slumber,
   are prepared to regard his judgments. Here, too, the mode of address
   which is employed must be attended to; in saying, that God poured
   contempt upon princes, it is as if it was his pleasure, so long as they
   retained their dignity, that honor and respect should be paid to them.
   The words of Daniel are well known,

   "O king, God hath put the fear of thee in the very fowls of the heaven
   and the beasts of the earth," (Daniel 2:8)

   And assuredly, though princes may clothe themselves with power, yet
   that inward honor and majesty which God has conferred upon them, is a
   greater safeguard than any human arm. Nor even would a single village
   hold out for the space of three days, did not God, by his invisible and
   invincible agency, put a restraint upon the hearts of men. Hence,
   whenever God renders princes contemptible, their magnificent power must
   of necessity be subverted. This is a fact corroborated by history, that
   mighty potentates, who have been the terror and dread of the whole
   world, when once denuded of their dignity and power, have become the
   sport even of their own dependants. And inasmuch as such a striking
   revolution as this should be regarded as a wonderful display of God's
   power, yet such is the obtuseness of our minds, that we will not
   acknowledge his overruling providence. As a contrast to these reverses,
   the prophet afterwards shows, that the poor and ignoble are exalted,
   and their houses increased, and that those who were held in no
   estimation, suddenly increase in wealth and power. In these things men
   would assuredly recognize the providence of God, were it not that the
   perversity of their minds rendered them insensate.

   Psalm 107:42-43

   42. The righteous shall see that, and shall rejoice: and all iniquity
   [290] shall stop her mouth. [291] 43. Whosoever is wise, so as to
   observe these things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of
   Jehovah.


   42 The righteous shall see that, and shall rejoice The prophet now
   draws the conclusion, that so many evident tokens of God's
   superintending and overruling providence could not transpire before the
   righteous without attracting their notice, and that their vision being
   illuminated by faith, these scenes are contemplated by them with
   unfeigned delight; while the wicked remain perplexed and mute. For he
   very judiciously makes a distinction between these two classes of
   persons. In whatever manner the wicked may be constrained to recognize
   God as the supreme ruler of the universe, nevertheless, in seeing they
   see not, and derive nothing from the sight, except that their conduct
   is rendered the more inexcusable. But the righteous are not only able
   to form a good and sound judgment of these events, they also
   spontaneously open their eyes to contemplate the equity, goodness, and
   wisdom of God, the sight and knowledge of which are refreshing to them.
   For the joy which they experience in this exercise is a pledge that
   their thus observing these things was the spontaneous effusion of their
   hearts. With regard to the despisers of God, it is not meant that they
   are so deeply impressed as truly to acknowledge that the world is under
   his superintending care, but that they are merely so far kept in check
   as not to presume to deny the existence of that providence as their
   natural inclination would lead them to do; or, at least, that they meet
   with a vigorous repulse whenever they attempt to speak in opposition to
   it. Although the judgments of God are before their eyes, yet is their
   understanding so darkened, that they cannot perceive the clear light.
   And this manner of speaking is more energetic than if it had been said,
   that the wicked themselves are become mute. In fact, they do not cease
   from murmuring against God's dispensations of providence; for we see
   with what arrogance and contempt they set themselves in opposition to
   our faith, and have the hardihood to pour forth horrid blasphemies
   against God. This does not impeach the veracity of the prophet's
   statement, that the mouth of wickedness is stopped, because, in fact,
   the more proudly and violently they assail God, the more notorious does
   their impiety appear. Besides, the joy here mentioned arises from this,
   that there is nothing more calculated to increase our faith, than the
   knowledge of the providence of God; because, without it, we would be
   harassed with doubts and fears, being uncertain whether or not the
   world was governed by chance. For this reason, it follows that those
   who aim at the subversion of this doctrine, depriving the children of
   God of true comfort, and vexing their minds by unsettling their faith,
   forge for themselves a hell upon earth. For what can be more awfully
   tormenting than to be constantly racked with doubt and anxiety? And we
   will never be able to arrive at a calm state of mind until we are
   taught to repose with implicit confidence in the providence of God.
   Moreover, it is declared in this verse, that God manifests his goodness
   to all men without exception, and yet there are comparatively few of
   them who benefit by it. Wherefore, when he formerly called upon all to
   celebrate the goodness of God, it was in order that the ingratitude of
   the majority of them might the more plainly appear.

   43. Whosoever is wise, so as to observe these things. We are now
   informed that men begin to be wise when they turn their whole attention
   to the contemplation of the works of God, and that all others besides
   are fools. For however much they may pique themselves upon their
   superior acuteness and subtilty, all this is of no avail so long as
   they shut their eyes against the light which is presented to them. In
   employing this interrogatory form of address, he indirectly adverts to
   that false persuasion which prevails in the world, at the very time
   when the most daring heaven-despiser esteems himself to be the wisest
   of men; as if he should say, that all those who do not properly observe
   the providence of God, will be found to be nothing but fools. This
   caution is the more necessary, since we find that some of the greatest
   of philosophers were so mischievous as to devote their talents to
   obscure and conceal the providence of God, and, entirely overlooking
   his agency, ascribed all to secondary causes. At the head of these was
   Aristotle, a man of genius and learning; but being a heathen, whose
   heart was perverse and depraved, it was his constant aim to entangle
   and perplex God's overruling providence by a variety of wild
   speculations; so much so, that it may with too much truth be said, that
   he employed his naturally acute powers of mind to extinguish all light.
   Besides, the prophet not only condemns the insensate Epicureans, whose
   insensibility was of the basest character, but he also informs us that
   a blindness, still greater and more detestable, was to be found among
   these great philosophers themselves. By the term, observe, he informs
   us, that the bare apprehension of the works of God is not enough, --
   they must be carefully considered in order that the knowledge of them
   may be deliberately and maturely digested. And, therefore, that it may
   be engraven upon our hearts, we must make these works the theme of our
   attentive and constant meditation. When the prophet says, Whosoever is
   wise, even they shall understand, the change of the singular into the
   plural number is beautifully appropriate. By the one he tacitly
   complains of the fewness of those who observe the judgments of God; as
   if he should say, How seldom do we meet with a person who truly and
   attentively considers the works of God! Then he adverts to the fact of
   their being so visibly before all, that it is impossible that men could
   overlook them, were it not that their minds are perverted by their own
   wickedness. And if any person be disposed to inquire how it comes to
   pass that the prophet, after treating of the judgments and severity of
   God, now makes mention of his loving-kindness, I answer, that his
   loving-kindness shines most conspicuously, and occupies a very
   prominent place in all that he does; for he is naturally prone to
   loving-kindness, by which also he draws us to himself.

   [272] "The author of this psalm is not known; but it was probably
   David, although some think it better to consider it as having been
   written after the return from the Babylonish captivity. This psalm is
   of very singular construction, and was obviously intended to be sung in
   responses. It has a frequently recurring double burden or intercalary
   verse. The first burden is found in verses 6, 13, 19, 28; the second 8,
   15, 21, 31; that is, after the description of a class of calamities
   comes the first chorus expressing the cry to the Lord for deliverance;
   then a single verse describes the deliverance as granted, after which
   follows the chorus of thanksgiving -- and thus on to verse 35, where
   the system ends. The last two burdens are, however, separate by two
   verses instead of one, as before. It will also be observed, that the
   second chorus has sometimes annexed another reflective distich,
   illustrative of the sentiment, as in verses 9, 16. There are many other
   examples of a similar arrangement to be found in the Psalms; but in
   Lowth's opinion, few of them are equal, and none superior, to this." --
   Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible. The beauties of this very
   interesting and highly instructive composition are many and striking,
   of which the least intelligent reader who peruses it with any degree of
   attention must be convinced. In point of poetical beauty, it may,
   according to the best judges, be classed with the most admired
   productions of Theocritus, Bion, Moschus, or Virgil. "It may
   undoubtedly be enumerated," remarks Lowth, "among the most elegant
   monuments of antiquity; and it is chiefly indebted for its elegance to
   the general plan and conduct of the poem. It celebrates the goodness
   and mercy of God towards mankind, as demonstrated in the immediate
   assistance and comfort which he affords, in the greatest calamities, to
   those who devoutly implore his aid: in the first place, to those who
   wander in the desert, and who encounter the horrors of famine; next, to
   those who are in bondage; again, to those who are afflicted with
   disease; and, finally, to those who are tossed about upon the ocean.
   The prolixity of the argument is occasionally relieved by narration;
   and examples are superadded of the divine severity in punishing the
   wicked, as well as of his benignity to the devout and virtuous." --
   Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews, volume 2, page 376. "Had
   such an Idyl," says Dr Adam Clarke, "appeared in Theocritus or Virgil,
   or had it been found as a scene in any of the Greek Tragedies, even in
   æschylus himself, it would have been praised up to the heavens, and
   probably been produced as their masterpiece."

   Psalm 108:1-13

   A Song or Psalm of David.

   1. My heart is prepared, O God! my heart is prepared; I will sing and
   give praise, even with my glory. 2. Awake, psaltery and harp: I will
   arise at break of day. 3. I will praise thee, O Jehovah! among the
   people; and sing unto thee among the nations: 4. Because thy goodness
   is great above the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. 5. Be thou,
   O God! exalted above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth: 6.
   That thy chosen may be set free, save me by thy right hand, and hear
   me. 7. God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
   Shechem, and measure the valley of Succoth. 8. Gilead is mine; Manasseh
   is mine; Ephraim is the strength of my head: Judah is my lawgiver.
   [292] 9. Moab is the pot of my washing; over Edom I will cast my shoe;
   over Philistina I will triumph. 10. Who will bring me into the
   fortified city? who will bring me even unto Edom? 11. Wilt not thou, O
   God! who hadst repulsed us? and wentest not out, O God! with our
   armies? 12. Lord us help out of our tribulations; because the help of
   man is vain. 13. Through God we will do valiantly, and he shall trample
   under foot our enemies.

   and sixtieth psalms, it would be superfluous to repeat, in this place,

   discriminated, both in the 57th and 60th psalms, from the rest of the
   context by the word Selah. This is a remarkable fact, and illustrates
   strongly one of the functions of the Diapsalma. These parts were, then,
   to a certain degree, regarded as distinct compositions, which

   PSALM 109

   This psalm consists of three parts. It begins with a complaint; next
   follows an enumeration of various imprecations; and then comes a prayer
   with an expression of true gratitude. And although David here complains
   of the injuries which he sustained, yet, as he was a typical character,
   everything that is expressed in the psalm must properly be applied to
   Christ, the Head of the Church, and to all the faithful, inasmuch as
   they are his members; so that when unjustly treated and tormented by
   their enemies, they may apply to God for help, to whom vengeance
   belongs. [294]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 109:1-5

   To the Chief Musician, a Psalm of David.

   1. O God of my praise! be not silent; 2. Because the mouth of the
   wicked and the mouth of deceit are opened upon me: they have spoken
   against me with the tongue of guile. 3. And they have encompassed me
   with the words of hatred, and have contended with me without cause. 4.
   On account of my love they have been opposed to me; but I gave myself
   to prayer. 5. They rendered to me evil for good, and hatred for love.


   1 O God of my praise! be not silent In these words, which may be
   considered as an introduction to the psalm, David declares that he
   neither could find nor would desire any other than God to stand forward
   in vindication of the integrity of his heart. For in denominating him
   the God of his praise, he intrusts to him the vindication of his
   innocence, in the face of the calumnies by which he was all but
   universally assailed. Some are of opinion that this clause is to be
   understood as referring to David's having actually declared that he
   himself was the publisher of God's praises; but the scope of the
   passage is opposed to such an interpretation; for we find David
   appealing to the judgment of God against the unjust and cruel hatred to
   which he was subjected in the world. There is in the words an implied
   contrast, because, when calumny is rampant, innocence is duly and
   properly estimated by none but God only. The meaning of the passage is
   this: Lord, although I may be regarded as the vilest of the vile, and
   exposed to the reproach of the world, yet thou wilt maintain the
   uprightness of my character, and on this account thou wilt also set
   forth my praise. [295] This interpretation corresponds well with that
   which is immediately subjoined, be not silent For when we are
   overwhelmed by the aspersions of the wicked, it would surely be
   improper on the part of God, who is the witness of our innocence, to
   remain silent. At the same time, what I formerly stated must not be
   forgotten, that while David mourns over the injuries which he in
   particular was suffering, yet, in his own person, he represented
   Christ, and the whole body of his Church. From this we are taught, when
   we are subjected to every species of indignity by men, to repose with
   perfect confidence under the protection of God alone. No man, however,
   can, with sincerity of heart, surrender himself entirely into the hand
   of God, except he has first formed the resolution of treating with
   contempt the reproaches of the world, and is also fully persuaded that
   he has God as the defender of his cause.

   2 Because the mouth of the wicked David here very plainly declares,
   that he was the more solicitous to obtain help from God, in consequence
   of justice not being found among men. And though it is probable that he
   was rashly and furiously assailed, nevertheless, he complains that the
   mouth of deceit and fraud had been opened against him, and that he was
   surrounded with false tongues. Whence, to those who were ignorant of
   his real situation, there would appear to be some plausible pretext for
   his being loaded with reproaches, so much so indeed, that he would not
   be able to evade the charge of criminality.

   3 And they have encompassed me He complains, that from all quarters he
   was assailed with the most hostile and abusive epithets, and that, too,
   most undeservedly. And, under a beautiful similitude, he shows that the
   tongues of his enemies were so full of deadly poison, that it was
   harder for him to endure their attacks than that of a great army, and
   the more so that he merited no such treatment at their hands. This
   species of warfare, to the exercise of which God very frequently
   summons his children, must be carefully considered by us. For though
   Satan may assault them with open violence, yet as he is the father of
   lies, he endeavors, by the amazing dexterity which he possesses in
   heaping calumny upon them, to tarnish their reputation, as if they were
   the most abandoned of mankind. Now, as that which was prefigured by
   David was fulfilled in Christ, so we must remember, that that which is
   behind of the afflictions of Christ is daily filling up in believers,
   Colossians 1:24; because, he having once suffered in himself, calls
   them to be sharers and associates with him in his sufferings.

   4 On account of my love they have been opposed to me [296] The Psalmist
   had already solemnly declared, that his adversaries, unprovoked by any
   injury inflicted upon them by him, and without any just cause, became,
   through mere diabolical rage, his most implacable foes. Here he
   confirms the truth of that declaration by saying, that he had been
   their friend. For there is far more merit in showing kindness to an
   enemy than simply abstaining from doing that which is evil. And from
   this we may perceive, that the influence of Satan must be awfully
   powerful when he takes the hearts of men captive at his will. For
   nothing can be more unnatural than to hate and cruelly persecute those
   who love us. To love he also adds deeds of kindness, meaning, that it
   was his aim to secure their good will by outward acts of beneficence.

   5 But I gave myself to prayer [297] Some are of opinion, that these
   words refer to David's pouring out a prayer for his enemies at the very
   moment when they were furiously assaulting him, and with this opinion
   corresponds that which we have stated in Psalm 35:13. But the more
   plain, and, to me, the preferable interpretation, is, that when he was
   attacked in a cruel and hostile manner, he did not betake himself to
   such unlawful means as the rendering of evil for evil, but committed
   himself into the hand of God, fully satisfied that he alone could guard
   him from all ill. And it is assuredly a great and desirable attainment
   for a man so to restrain his passions as directly and immediately to
   make his appeal to God's tribunal, at the very time when he is abused
   without a cause, and when the very injuries which he sustains are
   calculated to excite him to avenge them. For there are some persons
   who, while it is their aim to live in terms of friendship with the
   good, coming in contact with ill men, imagine that they are at perfect
   liberty to return injury for injury; and to this temptation all the
   godly feel that they are liable. The Holy Spirit, however, restrains
   us, so that though oftimes provoked by the cruelty of our enemies to
   seek revenge, we yet abandon all fraudulent and violent means, and
   betake ourselves by prayer to God alone. By this example, which David
   here sets before us, we are instructed that we must have recourse to
   the same means if we would wish to overcome our enemies through the
   power and protection of God. In Psalm 69:13, we have a parallel
   passage: "They that sit in the gate spake against me; and I was the
   song of those who drink strong drink. But my prayer was made to thee, O
   Jehovah!" In that passage, as well as in the one under review, the mode
   of expression is elliptical. Besides, it is the design of David in
   these words to inform us, that although he was aware that the whole
   world was opposed to him, yet he could cast all his cares upon God, and
   this was enough to render his mind calm and composed. And as the Holy
   Spirit taught David and all the godly to offer up prayers like these,
   it must follow, that those who, in this respect, imitate them, will be
   promptly helped by God when he beholds them reproachfully and vilely
   persecuted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [295] The Septuagint and Vulgate attach the same meaning to the
   Psalmist's prayer. The reading of the former being, O Theos ten ainesin
   mou me parasiopeses, and that of the latter, "Deus, laudem meam ne
   tacueris," O God! be not silent of my praise. The phrase, as it stands
   in the Hebrew text, is, however, capable of a double signification; for
   it may refer either to God's praising David, or to David's praising
   God. In the one case, it will intimate that God was the object of his
   praise; in which sense it is said, Deuteronomy 10:21, "He is thy
   praise, and He is thy God," and will mean, Be not silent to refuse,
   neglect not my praising of thee. In the other sense the prayer is, as
   our author states, Whilst others reproach me, be not silent of my
   praise, be thou my advocate, plead my causes, proclaim and justify my
   innocence.

   [296] "This expression," says Hengstenberg, "finds its full truth in
   Christ. Christ's love to man was daily manifested by his miraculous
   healing all the infirmities of the body, which was returned by man's
   hatred of Him, as displayed in his general conduct."

   [297] In the Hebrew, the sentence is very short and imperfect, "But I
   prayer;" I am a man of prayer; or, I betake myself to prayer. Thus "I
   peace" is put for "I am for peace." -- Psalm 120:7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 109:6-11

   6. Set [298] thou over him a wicked person; and let the adversary stand
   at his right hand. 7. When he is judged, let him depart guilty, and let
   his prayer be turned into sin. [299] 8. Let his days be few: [300] and
   let another receive his office. 9. Let his children be fatherless, and
   his wife a widow: 10. And [301] let his children wander without any
   settled habitation, and let them be beggars, and let them seek food out
   of their waste places. [302] 11. Let the extortioner [303] seize [304]
   all that belongs to him, and let strangers spoil his labor.


   6 Set thou over him a wicked person. [305] Hitherto he poured out his
   complaint against a vast number of persons; now he seems to direct it
   against a single individual. Probably he speaks of each of them
   individually. It is, however, equally probable that he refers in very
   marked terms to some one in particular among these wicked persons, the
   most notorious transgressor of any of them. Some conjecture, and not
   without reason, that Doeg is the person here aimed at, who, by his
   treason and revolt, sought to bring ruin, not only upon David, but also
   upon all the holy priests; and we know that this psalm is applied by
   Peter to Judas, (Acts 1:20) But with equal propriety, and certainly not
   less forcibly, may this complaint be considered as applicable to some
   most intimate and particular friend of the Psalmist. Respecting the
   imprecations contained in this psalm, it will be proper to keep in mind
   what I have said elsewhere, that when David forms such maledictions, or
   expresses his desires for them, he is not instigated by any immoderate
   carnal propensity, nor is he actuated by zeal without knowledge, nor is
   he influenced by any private personal considerations. These three
   matters must be carefully weighed, for in proportion to the amount of
   self-esteem which a man possesses, is he so enamoured with his own
   interests as to rush headlong upon revenge. Hence it comes to pass,
   that the more a person is devoted to selfishness, he will be the more
   immoderately addicted to the advancement of his own individual
   interests. This desire for the promotion of personal interest gives
   birth to another species of vice. For no one wishes to be avenged upon
   his enemies because that such a thing would be right and equitable, but
   because it is the means of gratifying his own spiteful propensity.
   Some, indeed, make a pretext of righteousness and equity in the matter,
   but the spirit of malignity, by which they are inflamed, effaces every
   trace of justice, and blinds their minds.

   When these two vices, selfishness and carnality, are corrected, there
   is still another thing demanding correction, the repressing the ardor
   of foolish zeal, in order that we may follow the Spirit of God as our
   guide. Should any one, under the influence of perverse zeal, produce
   David as an example of it, that would not be an example in point; for
   to such a person may be very aptly applied the answer which Christ
   returned to his disciples, "Ye know not what spirit ye are of," Luke
   9:55. How detestable a piece of sacrilege is it on the part of the
   monks, and especially the Franciscan friars, to pervert this psalm by
   employing it to countenance the most nefarious purposes! If a man
   harbour malice against a neighbor, it is quite a common thing for him
   to engage one of these wicked wretches to curse him, which he would do
   by daily repeating this psalm. I know a lady in France who hired a
   parcel of these friars to curse her own and only son in these words.

   But I return to David, who, free from all inordinate passion, breathed
   forth his prayers under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Then, as to
   the ungodly, who live as the contemners of God, and who are constantly
   plotting the overthrow of the unsuspecting and the good, casting off
   all restraint, so that neither modesty nor honesty proves a check to
   them, surely they are deserving of the punishment of having a wicked
   person set over them And since, by means of intrigue and perfidy, they
   are constantly aiming at the extermination of the good, they are most
   justly punished by God, who raises up against them an adversary that
   should never depart from their side. Only let believers be on their
   guard, lest they should betray too much haste in their prayers, and let
   them rather leave room for the grace of God to manifest itself in their
   behalf; because it may turn out that the man, who to-day bears towards
   us a deadly enmity, may by to-morrow through that grace become our
   friend.

   7 When he is judged, let him depart guilty Another imprecation is,
   that, being summoned to judgment, he might be punished without mercy,
   and that, though he humbly crave forgiveness, the judge should remain
   inexorable. This might with propriety be understood to relate not
   merely to his being judged at the bar of men, but also at the tribunal
   of God. But as it accords very well with the decisions awarded by an
   earthly judge, and as this is the commonly received interpretation, I
   have no wish to depart from it. There are two things which must be
   noticed here; that the wickedness of the wicked may be so palpable as
   to leave no room to escape from the execution of justice, and that all
   their entreaties for pardon may be disregarded. Accordingly, the
   Psalmist represents him as a condemned criminal leaving the presence of
   the judge, bearing the ignominy of the condemnation which he
   righteously merited, having his nefarious deeds disclosed and detected.
   With respect to the other interpretation which places the ungodly
   before God's judgment-seat, it by no means appears absurd to say that
   their prayers should be turned against them to sin, the more especially
   as we know that all their sacrifices are an abomination unto him. And
   by how much they themselves are filthy, by so much do all their
   plausible virtues become offensive and displeasing to God. But as the
   scope of the passage is in favor of that interpretation which applies
   it to earthly judges, I do not consider it necessary to insist farther
   upon this point.

   8 Let his days be few Although this world is the scene of much toil and
   trouble, yet we know that these are pledges and proofs of God's
   loving-kindness, inasmuch as he frequently, and as a token of his love,
   promises to prolong the lives of men; not that it is absolutely
   necessary for us to remain long here, but that we may have an
   opportunity of sharing of God's fatherly love which he bears towards
   us, by which we may be led to cherish the hope of immortality. Now, in
   opposition to this, the brevity of human life is here introduced as a
   mark of God's disapprobation; for when he cuts off the wicked after a
   violent manner, he thus testifies that they did not deserve to breathe
   the breath of life. And the same sentiment is inculcated when, denuding
   them of their honor and dignity, he hurls them from the place of power
   and authority. The same thing may also happen to the children of God,
   for temporal evils are common to the good and to the bad; at the same
   time, these are never so mingled and blended together, but that one may
   perceive occasionally the judgments of God in a very manifest and
   marked manner. Peter, quoting this verse, Acts 1:20, says it behoved to
   be fulfilled in Judas, because it is written here, "let another take
   his bishopric." And this, he does on the assumed principle of
   interpretation that David here spoke in the person of Christ. To this
   it cannot be objected, that the Hebrew term phqvdh, pekudah, signifies
   generally superintendence, [306] because Peter very properly applies it
   to the apostleship of Judas. In expounding this passage, sometimes in
   reference to a wife, or to the soul, (which is a precious jewel in
   man,) or to wealth and property, there is good reason to believe that,
   in doing so, the Jewish interpreters are actuated by pure malice. What
   purpose can it serve to pervert the sense of a word, the meaning of
   which is so pointed and plain, unless that, under the influence of a
   malignant spirit, they endeavor so to obscure the passage, as to make
   it appear not to be properly quoted by Peter? From these words we
   learn, that there is no cause why the ungodly should be proud while
   their reputation is high in this world, seeing they cannot after all
   escape from that doom which the Holy Spirit here declares awaits them.
   Here too we are furnished with very valuable matter of comfort and
   patience, when we hear that, however elevated may be their rank and
   reputation now, their downfall is approaching, and that they will soon
   be stript of all their pomp and power. In the two succeeding verses the
   malediction is extended both to the wife and children; and the desire,
   that she may be left a widow and they become fatherless, depends upon
   the brevity of that life to which the prophet formerly adverted.
   Mention is likewise made of beggary, and the want of all the
   necessaries of life, which is a proof of the magnitude of their guilt;
   for assuredly the Holy Spirit would not denounce against them a
   punishment so grievous and heavy for a trivial offense. In delivering
   up his property [307] as booty to the extortioners, David must be
   understood as alluding to the poverty which was to overtake his
   children; for he is not speaking of a poor and mean person who at his
   death can leave nothing to his family, but of one who, regardless of
   right or wrong, has amassed wealth to enrich his children, but from
   whom God takes away the goods which he had unrighteously taken from
   others.

   [298] "The spirit of prophecy is blended in a high degree with all the
   denunciations which follow, and which have relation to the impenitent
   Jews, and to the traitorous apostle." -- Morison.

   [299] "When his cause shall be examined, and when sentence shall be
   pronounced, let him, as the original signifies, go out guilty; in other
   words, let him be condemned; and when he pleads for a pardon, or for a
   mitigation of his sentence, let his petition, instead of receiving a
   favorable answer, be regarded as an aggravation of his crime." --
   Morison. Horsley understands the last clause as referring to the Jewish
   worship, which, he affirms, is now become sin, as it contains a
   standing denial of our Lord. Fry admits that Horsley's exposition of
   this line is ingenious. "But," says he, "tphlh, [which Calvin renders
   prayer,] from its etymology, and from its usage, Job 16:17, may be
   understood to mean a judicial sentence, and the parallelism in this
   place strongly argues for such an interpretation. Let the decision on
   him be Guilty.'" Accordingly, he reads, "On his trial let him come
   forth condemned, and let the decision be, For sin."

   [300] "His days shall be few. Hengstenberg says this word means few
   times, as if he considered it a substantive rather than an adjective;
   but it is doubtless an adjective belonging to ymyv, (his days.) The
   expression denotes that the man here spoken of should not live to a
   full age, but should meet with a premature death, either violently by
   the hands of others or by his own, as was the case with Judas. An
   untimely death is often mentioned in the Old Testament as a punishment
   on men who are eminently guilty. Bloody and deceitful men shall not
   live out half their days,' Psalm 55:23. See also Proverbs 10:27. This
   passage is applicable not to Judas only, but also to the Jews in
   general, for after the crucifixion of our Lord, their days were few;
   they were soon dispossessed of their country, and became the outcasts
   of the earth." -- Phillips. Horsley also explains this of the days of
   the Jewish commonwealth, which were very few after our Lord's
   ascension; and the subsequent clause, "let another receive his office,"
   he understands as denoting that "the Christian Church is become the
   depository of revelation, which was the particular charge of the Jewish
   race."

   [301] "The 10th and 11th verses allude to the state of the Jews in
   their dispersion, having nowhere any settled home." -- Horsley.

   [302] Horsley reads this verse as follows: -- "Let his children be mere
   vagabonds, and beg;
   Let them be driven out from the very ruins of their dwelling." "For
   ydrsv," says he, "the LXX. had ygrsv; let them be driven out.' This
   reading Houbigant and Archbishop Secker approve. The image is,
   vagabonds seeking a miserable shelter among the ruins of decayed and
   demolished buildings, and not suffered to remain even in such places
   undisturbed."

   [303] "Literally, the lender' or creditor.' But from the
   hard-heartedness of the Jews towards their debtors, of which we have
   instances in 2 Kings 4:1; Nehemiah 5:1-13; the word seems in latter
   times to have carried a bad sense; and so it is rendered in our
   translation, the extortioner.'" -- Mant.

   [304] "ynqs shall catch, or secure. It seems to denote, to catch by
   laying snares. See Psalm 38:13. This sense suits very well this
   passage; for the usurer is accustomed to obtain the substance of men by
   all kinds of artifices." -- Phillips. Horsley renders, "draw his net
   over all that he hath." How striking a representation of the treatment
   which the Jews, since the time of the last destruction of their city,
   and their dispersion by the Romans, have received from almost all
   nations among whom they have been scattered! For some time they have
   been permitted to live in Britain, Holland, and Germany, unmolested;
   but what a tale of misery does the tyrannical exactions of which they
   have been the prey for centuries constitute!

   [305] Dr Geddes translates the 6th verse thus: -- "May he be tried by a
   wicked judge;
   And at his right had be placed the accuser." On which he has the
   following note: -- "May he be tried by a wicked judge. He alludes to
   courts of judicature: and wishes that his enemy may have a severe, nay,
   wicked judge, -- certainly one of the greatest curses that can befall
   one. -- And at his right hand be placed the accuser. Instead of a
   friend or advocate to stand by him, let his only attendant be an
   accuser. What imagery this! But the height of the metaphor is in the
   next verse: -- When he is judged, may he be found guilty:
   And may his deprecation only aggravate his crime.'" With this
   corresponds the interpretation of Phillips. With Hammond, he
   understands to set over as denoting to set over as a judge or
   inspector. "This notion of setting over," he observes, "corresponds
   with the next member; for there it says, and an enemy shall stand at
   his right hand, which shows that the wicked man was to be appointed to
   act as a judge. The man at his right hand denotes an accuser, agreeably
   to the custom which prevailed in a Jewish court of justice, of placing
   the accuser at the right hand of the accused, (see Zechariah 3:1;) and
   hence we understand in this verse rs to be mentioned as acting in the
   capacity of a judge, and rtn in that of an accuser." Cresswell gives a
   similar explanation of the passage. Green, who follows Dr Sykes in
   thinking that the imprecations from this verse to verse 17 were
   pronounced not by David upon his enemies, but by David's enemies upon
   him, reads the verse thus: -- "Set a wicked man over him, say they, to
   hear his cause, and let a false accuser stand at his right hand."

   Psalm 109:12-16

   12. Let there be none prolonging mercy to him: and let there be none to
   pity his fatherless children. 13. Let his posterity be cut off; in the
   next generation let their name be effaced. 14. Let the iniquity of his
   fathers be remembered before Jehovah; and let not the sin of his mother
   be blotted out. 15. Let them be before Jehovah continually, and let him
   cut off their memorial from the earth. [308] 16. Because he forgot to
   show mercy, but persecuted the afflicted and poor man, and the
   sorrowful in heart, that he might slay him.


   12 Let there be none prolonging mercy to him. To continue to show
   humanity and mercy is, according to the Hebrew idiom, equivalent to
   constant and successive acts of kindness; and it also sometimes denotes
   pity, or the being moved to sympathy, when, through the lapse of years,
   anger is appeased, and even one's calamity melts the heart of the man
   who bore hatred towards him. [309] Accordingly, there are some who
   understand this clause to mean, that there will be none to show
   kindness to his offspring; which interpretation is in conformity with
   the next clause of the verse. David, however, includes also the wicked
   man himself along with his children; as if he should say, Though he
   visibly pine away under such calamities, and these descend to his
   children, yet let no one show pity towards them. We are aware it not
   unfrequently happens, that the long-continued misfortune of an enemy
   either excites the sympathy of men of savage dispositions, or else
   makes them forget all their hatred and malevolence. But in this part of
   the psalm, David expresses a desire that his enemy and all his
   posterity may be so hated and detested, that the people may never be
   wearied with beholding the calamities which they endure, but may become
   so familiarised with the spectacle, as if their hearts were of iron. At
   the same time, let it be remarked, that David is not rashly excited by
   any personal anguish to speak in this manner, but that it is as God's
   messenger he declares the punishment which was impending over the
   ungodly. And verily the law accounts it as one of the judgments of God,
   his hardening men's hearts, so that they who have been passionately and
   unmercifully cruel, should find no sympathy, Deuteronomy 2:30. It is
   just that the same measure which they have used towards others, should
   also be meted out to themselves.

   13. Let his posterity be cut off. This is a continuation of the same
   subject, upon the consideration of which the prophet had just now
   entered, that God would visit the iniquities of the fathers upon their
   children. And as he had to deal with the whole court of Saul, and not
   with any single individual, he here employs the plural number. But as
   in deeds of wickedness, there are always some who are the prime movers,
   and act as the ringleaders of others, we need not be surprised that
   having spoken of one person, he next addresses the many, and then
   returns to the same person. The more natural and simple mode of
   explanation is to refer it to his offspring, for the Hebrew term which
   signifies posterity is collective, implying a multitude, and not a
   single individual only. This is a heavier imprecation than the former.
   It sometimes happens, that a family, overthrown by an unexpected
   disaster, rises up again at a subsequent period; here, however, it is
   the wish of the prophet, that the wicked may be so completely ruined,
   as never to be able to regain their former state; for thus much is
   implied in their name being effaced in the next generation, or after
   the lapse of ages.

   And as the destruction which he denounces against the houses and
   families of the wicked is so extensive, that God punishes them in the
   person of their posterity, so he desires that God may remember the
   iniquities of their fathers and mothers, in order that their
   condemnation may be complete; and this is a principle in perfect
   accordance with the commonly received doctrine of Scripture. God, out
   of regard to his covenant, which is in force to a thousand generations,
   extends and continues his mercy towards posterity; but he also punishes
   iniquity unto the third and fourth generation. In doing this he does
   not involve the guiltless with the wicked indiscriminately, but by
   withholding from the reprobate the grace and illumination of his
   Spirit, he prepares the vessels of wrath for destruction, even before
   they are born, Romans 9:21. To the common sense of mankind, the thought
   of such severity is horrifying: but then we must recollect, that if we
   attempt to measure the secret and inscrutable judgments of God by our
   finite minds, we do him wrong. Struck with horror at the severity of
   this threatening, let us improve it as the means of filling us with
   reverence and godly fear. In reference to the language of Ezekiel,

   "The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, but the soul that
   sinneth, it shall die;" Ezekiel 18:20

   we know that in these words he disproves the groundless complaints of
   the people, who, boasting that they were guiltless, imagined that they
   were punished wrongfully. When, however, God continues his vengeance
   from the father to the children, he leaves them no room for palliation
   or complaint, because they are all equally guilty. We have already
   said, that vengeance commences when God in withdrawing his Spirit, both
   from the children and the fathers, delivers them over to Satan. Some
   may inquire how it comes to pass, that the prophet, in desiring that
   their sin may be continually before God's eyes, does not likewise add,
   let their name be blotted out from heaven, but merely wishes them to be
   cut off, and to perish in the world? My reply is, that he spoke
   agreeably to the custom of the age in which he lived, when the nature
   of spiritual punishments was not so well understood as in our times,
   because the period had not yet arrived, when the revelation of God's
   will was to be full and complete. Besides, it is the design of David,
   that the vengeance of God may be so manifest, that the whole world may
   acquiesce in his equity as a judge.

   16. Because he forgot to show mercy The prophet comes now to show that
   he had good reason for desiring such awful and direful calamities to be
   inflicted upon his enemies, whose thirst for cruelty was insatiable,
   and who were transported with rage, no less cruel than obstinate,
   against the afflicted and poor man, persecuting him with as little
   scruple as if they were attacking a dead dog. Even philosophers look
   upon cruelty, directed against the helpless and miserable, as an act
   worthy only of a cowardly and grovelling nature; for it is between
   equals that envy is cherished. For this reason the prophet represents
   the malignity of his enemies as being bitter in persecuting him when he
   was in affliction and poverty. The expression, the sorrowful in heart,
   is still more emphatic. For there are persons who, notwithstanding of
   their afflictions, are puffed up with pride; and as this conduct is
   unreasonable and unnatural, these individuals incur the displeasure of
   the powerful. On the other hand, it would be a sign of desperate
   cruelty to treat with contempt the lowly and dejected in heart. Would
   not this be to fight with a shadow? This insatiable cruelty is still
   farther pointed out by the phrase, forgetting to show mercy; the
   meaning of which is, that the calamities, with which he beheld this
   guiltless and miserable man struggling, fail to excite his pity, so
   that, out of regard to the common lot of humanity, he should lay aside
   his savage disposition. In this passage, therefore, the contrast is
   equally balanced on the one side between such obstinate pride, and on
   the other, the strict and irrevocable judgment of God. And as David
   spoke only as he was moved by the Holy Spirit, this imprecation must be
   received as if God himself should thunder from his celestial throne.
   Thus, in the one case, by denouncing vengeance against the ungodly, he
   subdues and restrains our perverse inclinations, which might lead us to
   injure a fellow-creature; and on the other, by imparting comfort to us,
   he mitigates and moderates our sorrow, so that we patiently endure the
   ills which they inflict upon us. The wicked may for a time revel with
   impunity in the gratification of their lusts; but this threatening
   shows that it is no vain protection which God vouchsafes to the
   afflicted. But let the faithful conduct themselves meekly, that their
   humility and contrition of spirit may come up before God with
   acceptance. And as we cannot distinguish between the elect and the
   reprobate, it is our duty to pray for all who trouble us; to desire the
   salvation of all men; and even to be careful for the welfare of every
   individual. At the same time, if our hearts are pure and peaceful, this
   will not prevent us from freely appealing to God's judgment, that he
   may cut off the finally impenitent. [310]

   Psalm 109:17-20

   17. As he loved cursing, so let it come upon him: [311] as he did not
   take delight in blessing, so let it be far from him. 18. And let him be
   clothed with cursing as with a garment, and let it come as water into
   his bowels, and as oil into his bones. [312] 19. Let it be to him as a
   mantle to cover him, and a girdle to gird himself with continually. 20.
   Let this be the work from Jehovah of those who are hostile to me, and
   of those who speak evil against my soul.


   17 As he loved cursing David still continues to enumerate the sins of
   his adversaries, and is thus severe in his treatment of them, in order
   to render it more apparent, that he is strictly conforming to the
   judgment of God. For as often as we draw near to the tribunal of God,
   we must take care that the equity of our cause may be so sure and
   evident as to secure for it and us a favorable reception from him.
   Fortified by the testimony of an approving conscience, David here
   declares his readiness to commit the matter between him and his enemies
   to the judgment of God. The words, which are expressive of cursing and
   blessing, are in the past tense, cursing came upon him, and blessing
   was far from him, but it is necessary to translate them as expressive
   of a wish or desire; for David continues to pray that his enemy may be
   visited with the same unparalleled ills which he had inflicted upon
   others. A stranger to every act of kindness, and taking pleasure in
   doing evil, it is the wish of the Psalmist that he may now be subjected
   to every species of calamity. Some take malediction to mean cursing and
   imprecation, thereby intimating that this man was so addicted to
   execration, that mischief and malevolence were constantly in his heart,
   and proceeding from his lips. While I do not reject this opinion, I am
   yet disposed to take a more extended view of the passage, That by
   injury and abuse, he aimed at the suppression and abolition of every
   mark of kindness, and that he took delight in the calamities which he
   beheld coming upon the unsuspecting and the good.

   Not a few interpreters translate the next two verses in the past form,
   he clothed himself with cursing, etc., which would be tantamount to
   saying that the enemy was as fond of cursing as of costly apparel, or
   that he clothed himself with it as with a garment, and that, like an
   inveterate disease, it was deeply seated in the marrow of his bones.
   The other interpretation is more simple, That cursing should cleave to
   the wicked, that it should envelop him like a cloak, gird him about as
   his girdle, and should even penetrate to his bones. And that no one may
   rashly take for an example what David here spoke by the special
   influence of the Holy Spirit, let him keep in mind that the Psalmist is
   not pleading here in reference to any personal interest, and that it is
   no ordinary character to whom he refers. Belonging to the number of the
   faithful, he would not omit the law of charity, in desiring the
   salvation of all men. But in this instance God elevated his spirit
   above all earthly considerations, stript him of all malice, and
   delivered him from the influence of turbulent passion, so that he
   might, with holy calmness and spiritual wisdom, doom the reprobate and
   castaway to destruction. Others, would have the phrase, he loved
   cursing, to mean that he purposely drew down the vengeance of God upon
   himself, as it were procuring destruction for himself by his open
   hostility to him; but this is an unnatural construction of the passage.
   The interpretation which I have given is preferable, That he was so
   addicted to mischief and wrong, that no act of justice or kindness was
   to be expected from him. In the meantime, let it be observed, that all
   the machinations of the wicked will eventually recoil upon their own
   heads, and that when they are raging more violently against others,
   then it is that the mischief, which they so eagerly desire may come
   upon them, falls upon themselves, even as the wind called Cecias by
   blowing attracts the clouds unto him.

   20 Let this be the work from Jehovah. That is, let the gain or reward
   of the work be from God. In pointing out the work as proceeding
   immediately from God, he intends to show that, though deprived of all
   human aid, he yet entertained the hope that God would grant him
   deliverance, and avenge the injuries of his servant. From this verse we
   learn that David did not rashly, or unadvisedly, utter curses against
   his enemies, but strictly adhered to what the Spirit dictated. I
   acknowledge, indeed, that not a few, while they pretend a similar
   confidence and hope, nevertheless, recklessly rush beyond the bounds of
   temperance and moderation. But that which David beheld by the unclouded
   eye of faith, he also uttered with a zeal becoming a sound mind; for
   having devoted himself to the cultivation of piety, and being protected
   by the hand of God, he was aware that the day was approaching when his
   enemies would meet with merited punishment. From which we also learn,
   that his trust was placed in God alone, and that he did not regard the
   persons of men so as to direct his course according as the world smiled
   or frowned upon him. And, assuredly, whosoever places his dependence on
   men, shall find that the most trifling incident will annoy him.
   Therefore, should the whole world abandon us, it becomes us, in
   imitation of this holy man, to lift up our heads to heaven, and thence
   look for our defender and deliverer. If it be his intention to employ
   human instrumentality for our deliverance, he will soon raise up those
   who will accomplish his purpose. Should he, for the trial of our faith,
   deprive us of all earthly assistance, instead of regarding that as any
   reflection upon the glory of his name, we ought to wait until the
   proper time arrive when he will fully display that decision in which we
   can calmly acquiesce.

   [311] "This curse alludes to the imprecation by which the Jews ventured
   to take upon themselves the guilt of our Lord's death, when Pilate
   pronounced him innocent. The blessing, on which they set not their
   heart,' was that which they might have obtained from our Lord." --
   Horsley.

   [312] The Hebrew word for garment in this verse signifies, according to
   Parkhurst, "a long robe, a garment commensurate with the body." See his
   Lexicon mr, 3. Horsley renders it, "a garment fitted to him," which he
   takes to be the precise sense of mrv. The phrase in the following verse
   he renders, "as the close garment which wraps him." In the second
   clause there is probably an allusion to the water of jealousy. See
   Numbers 5:18. More forcible language than that of this and the
   subsequent verse could not be employed to convey the strength and
   perfection of that curse which fell on the Jewish nation; and the
   condition of that people, ever since their dispersion by the Romans,
   affords abundant evidence that the terms here made use of, strong as
   they are, to predict this condition, are but barely adequate to afford
   us a just notion of its sad reality. "The curse that lighted on the
   Jewish nation," observes Bishop Horne, in illustration of this and the
   next verse, "is resembled, for its universality and adhesion, to a
   garment' which covereth the whole man, and is girded' close about his
   loins; for its diffusive and penetrating nature to water,' which from
   the stomach passeth into the bowels,' and is dispersed through all the
   vessels of the frame; and to oil,' which imperceptibly insinuates
   itself into the very bones.' When that unhappy multitude, assembled
   before Pontius Pilate, pronounced the words, His blood be on us and on
   our children,' then did they put on the envenomed garment, which has
   stuck to and tormented the nation ever since; then did they eagerly
   swallow down that deadly draught, the effects whereof have been the
   infatuation and misery of 1700 years."

   Psalm 109:21-27

   21. And thou, O Jehovah my Lord! undertake for me, for thy name's sake;
   deliver me, because thy mercy is good; 22. Because I am poor and needy,
   and my heart is wounded within me. 23. I walk about as a shadow when it
   declineth. [313] I am tossed as the locust. [314] 24. My knees are
   become feeble through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. 25. But
   I became a reproach to them; when they see me they shake their head.
   26. Help me, O Jehovah my God! save me according to thy mercy: 27. And
   they shall know that this is thy hand, and that thou, O Jehovah! hast
   done it.


   21 And thou, O Jehovah my Lord! From the pouring out of complaints and
   imprecations against his enemies, the Psalmist passes to prayers; or
   rather, after having betaken himself to God as his guardian and
   deliverer, he appears to take occasion, from this circumstance, to
   encourage himself in prayer; even as all the pious reflections by which
   the faithful exercise and strengthen their faith, stimulate them to
   call upon the name of God. At the same time, he does not pique himself
   upon any service which he has rendered to God, as deserving of his
   help, nor does he rely upon his own worthiness, but he places all his
   confidence in the free grace and mercy of God. That integrity of which
   he was conscious, he placed in opposition to his enemies, for the
   purpose of making their iniquity more manifest; but he does not aspire
   after any recompense from God, because he adopts the nobler principle,
   that of owing every thing to God's voluntary choice, upon which also he
   acknowledges his safety depends. Were it lawful for any one to boast of
   his virtues and merits, certainly David was not the man who was least
   entitled to do so; and, moreover, he was the representative of Christ,
   and of the whole Church. Hence it follows, that all our prayers will
   vanish in smoke, unless they are grounded upon the mercy of God. The
   case of Christ was indeed a peculiar one, inasmuch as it was by his own
   righteousness that he appeased the wrath of his Father towards us. As,
   however, his human nature was entirely dependant on the good pleasure
   of God, so it was his will, by his own example, to direct us to the
   same source. What can we do, seeing that the most upright among us is
   constrained to acknowledge that he is chargeable with the commission of
   much sin; surely we never can make God our debtor? It follows,
   therefore, that God, on account of the benignity of his nature, takes
   us under his protection; and that, because of the goodness of his
   mercy, he desires his grace may shine forth in us. In coming to God, we
   must always remember that we must possess the testimony of a good
   conscience, and must beware of harbouring the thought that we have any
   inherent righteousness which would render God our debtor, or that we
   deserve any recompense at his hands. For if, in the preservation of
   this short and frail life, God manifests the glory of his name and of
   his goodness, how much more ought all confidence in good works to be
   laid aside, when the subject-matter referred to is life heavenly and
   eternal? If, in the prolonging of my life for a short time on earth,
   his name is thereby glorified, by manifesting of his own accord towards
   me his benignity and liberality; when, therefore, having delivered me
   from the tyranny of Satan, he adopts me into his family, washes away my
   impurity in the blood of Christ, regenerates me by his Holy Spirit,
   unites me to his Son, and conducts me to the life of heaven, -- then,
   assuredly, the more bountifully he treats me, the less should I be
   disposed to arrogate to myself any portion of the praise. How different
   a part does David act, who, in order to procure favor for himself,
   publishes his own poverty and misery? And as outward affliction is of
   no avail, unless a man, at the same time, be humbled, and his proud and
   rebellious spirit be subdued, the Psalmist here repeats, that his heart
   was wounded within him. From which we may learn, that God will be a
   physician to none, except to such as in the spirit of genuine humility
   send up their sighs and groans to him, and do not become hardened under
   their afflictions.

   23 I walk about as a shadow. These are two very appropriate
   similitudes: to the first of them I formerly adverted in Psalm 102:12;
   namely, that the afflicted person, and he who is almost lifeless, is
   very fitly compared to the shadow of the evening. At sunrise, or when
   he is shining in noon-day brightness, the constant shifting of the
   shadow is not so perceptible; but, towards sunset, the shadow flits
   before us during every moment that passes. By the other similitude, the
   transitory nature of all sublunary things is pointed out. For as the
   locusts are constantly skipping from one place to another, so David
   complains of his life being ever rendered uneasy by incessant
   persecution, so that no space was allowed him for repose; and this is
   similar to what he says in Psalm 11:1, that he was compelled to flee
   like a sparrow, for which the fowler lays snares in all directions. In
   short, he mourns over his forlorn situation, that he could find no
   place of safety, and that, even among men, he could get no habitation.
   And, as in this psalm, he presents us with a picture of the whole
   Church, we need not be surprised if God try us, and arouse us from our
   lethargy, by an innumerable variety of events. Accordingly, Paul, 1
   Corinthians 4:11, speaking of himself and others, says, that they have
   no certain dwelling-place; a description which is more or less
   applicable to all the children of God.

   24 My knees are become feeble. Though David had the necessaries of
   life, yet he emaciated himself by voluntary abstinence, to which, as
   well as to prayer, he gave himself, and therefore we may regard this
   verse as expressive of his sorrow and sadness. We may also understand
   it as expressive of his having no relish for meat or drink, knowing, as
   we do, that persons who are in sorrow and sadness have no appetite for
   food; even life itself is burdensome to them. Should any one prefer
   restricting the interpretation to David's being in want of the
   necessaries of life, when he hid himself in the dens of wild beasts, to
   escape the fury of his enemies, and was then subjected to hunger and
   thirst, he may do so. It appears to me, however, that by this language
   he intends to point out the extreme anguish which he felt, because,
   with death staring him in the face, he loathed all food; and this is in
   accordance with the next clause, in which he says, my flesh faileth of
   fatness; because "a sorrowful spirit drieth up the bones," (Proverbs
   17:22) By the term, fatness, some understand delicacies; meaning that
   he was deprived of all that food which is pleasing to the palate. The
   more natural way is to consider it as denoting his becoming emaciated
   by reason of grief and fasting, inasmuch as the natural moisture was
   wasted. Another proof of his sad situation arises from this, that,
   according to what he states in Psalm 22:7, he was held in scorn by all.
   It is, indeed, a sad and bitter thing which God's children endure, when
   they are made to feel that the curse which he denounces against the
   transgressors of his law is directed against themselves; for the law
   says to the despisers of it,

   "Thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and laughing-stock,"
   (Deuteronomy 28:37)

   With this species of temptation David was assailed; and he declares
   that he was not only regarded as a condemned person, but also cruelly
   derided; God at the same time coming in for a share of it; for it is
   usual with the ungodly to conduct themselves with insolence and pride
   towards us when they see us oppressed under afflictions, and, at the
   same time, to rail at our faith and piety, because God renders us no
   help in our miseries.

   26 Help me, O Jehovah! The prophet repeats his prayer, because the more
   we are assailed by the subtilty and deceit of Satan, the more necessary
   is it for us to strive more ardently, and display the greater boldness.
   We may, indeed, have the full assurance of God being propitious towards
   us, yet when he delays to manifest it, and when the ungodly slander us,
   it must be that various doubts which keep intruding themselves upon us
   arise in our minds. Hence, it is not without reason that David, in
   order that he might withstand such attacks, places himself under the
   protection of that God who, according to his mercy and goodness, helps
   his people in their time of need. He implores that deliverance may be
   extended to him, not by ordinary means, but by the peculiar and special
   display of God's power, so that his enemies may stand abashed, and not
   dare to open their mouths; and we know that God sometimes secretly
   grants succor to his servants, while, at other times, he stretches out
   his hand in such a visible manner, that the ungodly, though they shut
   their eyes, are constrained to acknowledge that there is divine agency
   connected with their deliverance. For as his enemies had exalted
   themselves against God, so it was his desire, after they shall have
   been subdued, to exult over them in the name of God. In cherishing this
   desire, he has no wish to procure for himself the renown of being
   valiant in war, but that God's power may be displayed, that no flesh
   may glory in his sight. The words may also be viewed as referring both
   to his deliverance from his enemies, and to his affliction; his desire
   being to attribute his deliverance mainly to the grace of God; because,
   in opposing the hand of God to fortune and to all human means of
   deliverance, it is plainly his intention that God should be recognised
   as the alone author of it. This deserves to be carefully considered by
   us, for however anxious we are to be delivered by the hand of God, yet
   there is scarcely one among a hundred who makes the manifestation of
   God's glory his chief end; that glory for which we ought to have a
   greater regard than for our own safety, because it is far more
   excellent. Whosoever then is desirous that the ungodly may be
   constrained to acknowledge the power of God, ought the more carefully
   to take heed to the help of God which in his own case he experiences;
   for it would be most absurd to point out the hand of God to others, if
   our minds have not recognised it.

   [313] Horsley translates, "I am just gone, like the shadow stretched to
   its utmost length." The allusion is to the state of the shadows of
   terrestrial objects at sun-set, lengthening every instant, and growing
   faint as they lengthen, and in the instant that they shoot to an
   immeasurable length, disappearing. As a shadow, when it is extended by
   the sun's setting, is approaching to evanescence, so, saith the speaker
   in this psalm, I am fast disappearing; that is, am approaching the end
   of mortal life.

   [314] The Hebrew word for locust is in the singular number; but the
   Septuagint reads in the plural, and a plurality may be intended.
   Locusts are accustomed to fly in great numbers, and the swarms of them
   are sometimes so numerous in Eastern countries, that they fly in the
   air like a succession of clouds, forming enormous compact bodies. But
   when the wind blows briskly, locusts being weak and feeble creatures,
   these swarms are often tossed, broken into separate masses, thrown one
   upon another, and driven over the sea, into which they fall when no
   longer able to sustain their flight. -- See Exodus 10:13, 19. So
   powerless was the speaker in this psalm before his persecuting enemies.
   He was driven by them from place to place, without the power to offer
   any resistance. Hammond, who considers the psalm as having been
   composed by David when forced to flee from Jerusalem by the rebellion
   of his son Absalom, after referring to this explanation of the
   metaphor, observes: "Another possible way there is of understanding the
   resemblance. The locust is but a large sort of grasshopper, which hath
   no set abiding-place or rest, but leaps to and fro, roves about the
   field: so we have the running to and fro of locusts,' Isaiah 33:4. And
   this uncertain, unsettled condition of those creatures, may be proper
   also to express David's condition in his flight, when he had not where
   to lay his head, but wandered from place to place uncertainly. But the
   former, that is founded in the bands of locusts, is fitter to express
   David and the company with him, his weak fugitive army, than that which
   is founded in the manner of the single locust or grasshopper."

   Psalm 109:28-31

   28. They shall curse, but thou shalt bless: when they arise, they shall
   be put to shame; but thy servant shall rejoice. 29. My adversaries
   shall be clothed with shame, and covered with their own confusion, as
   with a garment. 30. I will praise Jehovah greatly with my mouth; and I
   will extol him in the midst of the great, [315] 31. Because he standeth
   at the right hand of the poor, to deliver his soul from condemnations.
   [316]


   28. They shall curse. Interpreters are divided in their opinions about
   the meaning of these words. One class would render them as expressive
   of a desire or wish: Let them curse, provided that thou bless: let them
   arise, and be clothed with confusion Another class, and with them I
   readily agree, adopt the future tense of the indicative mood, They
   shall curse, etc. Should any prefer to understand the passage as
   indicating, on the part of the Psalmist, his resolution to suffer and
   submit to the curses of his enemies, I do not oppose their
   interpretation. In my opinion, however, those who view the words as a
   prayer, misinterpret them; because David, having already presented his
   petitions to God, and being secure in his favor, seems now rather to
   boast that their cursing will do him no harm; for Thou, says he, wilt
   bless me. By this means, he proves how little and how lightly he
   regarded the menaces of his enemies, though they might assail him by
   the poison of the tongue, and the power of the sword. From the example
   of David, let us learn to form the resolution of engaging God on our
   side, who can baffle all the designs of our enemies, and inspire us
   with courage to set at defiance their malice, wickedness, audacity,
   power, and fury.

   And then, indeed, it is that the loving-kindness of God appears, when
   it banishes from our minds the fears which we entertain of the
   threatenings of the world. Therefore, relying upon the grace of God,
   boldly setting at nought the machinations and attacks of his enemies,
   believing that they could not prevail against God's blessing, David
   raises the shout of triumph even in the midst of the battle. This truth
   is still more impressively inculcated in the succeeding clause of the
   verse: Though they arise, yet shall they be put to shame. By these
   words it is obviously his design to intimate that the ungovernable
   violence of his enemies is not yet subdued, but that he can endure all
   their fury and foam so long as the hand of God is stretched forth to
   maintain and defend him; and thus he animates and fortifies himself
   against all the pride of the world, and, at the same time, by his
   example emboldens all the faithful, so that they do not feel dejected
   even when the perverseness of their enemies seems to get the advantage
   over them, and to menace them with instant destruction. Cherishing such
   a hope, he trusts that, for the future, he shall be delivered from all
   his sorrows. Whence let us learn to bear patiently and meekly our
   trials, until the fit season and the full time, which God hath
   appointed, arrive for turning our weeping into joy. In the following
   verse he proceeds in the same strain of exultation, because, though he
   beholds the ungodly assuming a lofty air, yet, looking beyond the
   present state of things with the eye of faith, he entertains no doubt
   that God will frustrate all their designs, and pour contempt upon all
   their schemes.

   30. I will praise Jehovah greatly with my mouth These words clearly
   establish the truth of the observation I formerly made, that David does
   not pray God to curse his enemies, but, by the holy boldness of his
   faith, sets them at defiance; for he prepares to offer up a tribute of
   gratitude to God, as if he had already realised the object of his
   desire. The phrase, with my mouth, is not, as some erroneously suppose,
   superfluous, but is to be considered as a public acknowledgement, on
   his part, of his thanksgiving to God for the deliverance vouchsafed to
   him; as if he should say, I will, not only when alone and when no human
   eye beholds me, and in the inward recesses of my heart, meditate upon
   the great goodness which I have received from God, but also in the
   appointed sacrifice of praise will I declare publicly, before men, how
   much I am indebted to his grace. Agreeably to this meaning, he adds, in
   the assembly of great, or of many men; for the term rvym, rabbim, is
   susceptible of being rendered both ways. I prefer rendering it, great
   men, because it appears to me, that David refers to an assembly of men
   of notable and noble rank. He declares that he will acknowledge the
   goodness of God, not only in some obscure corner, but also in the great
   assembly of the people, and among governors and those of noble rank. In
   the celebration of God's praises, there can be no question that these
   must issue from the heart ere they be uttered by the lips; at the same
   time, it would be an indication of great coldness, and of want of
   fervor, did not the tongue unite with the heart in this exercise. The
   reason why David makes mention of the tongue only is, that he takes it
   for granted that, unless there be a pouring out of the heart before
   God, those praises which reach no farther than the ear are vain and
   frivolous; and, therefore, from the very bottom of his soul, he pours
   forth his heart-felt gratitude in fervent strains of praise; and this
   he does, from the same motives which ought to influence all the
   faithful -- the desire of mutual edification; for to act otherwise
   would be to rob God of the honor which belongs to him.

   Moreover, he also subjoins the form in which he rendered thanks;
   namely, that God stood at the right hand of the poor By this language
   he intimates, that when God had apparently forsaken and abandoned him,
   and stood far from him, even then he was always near and ready to
   render him seasonable and needful help; and, assuredly, his poverty and
   affliction gave some reason for suspecting that he was forsaken of God,
   inasmuch as he then either withdrew or concealed his loving-kindness.
   Notwithstanding of this seeming departure, he acknowledges that, during
   his affliction and poverty, God never ceased to be present to render
   him assistance. In saying that he was saved from the judges of his
   life, he sets forth, in a still stronger light, the very trying
   situation in which he was placed; his having to deal with very
   formidable enemies, such as the king and the princes of the realm, who,
   proudly presuming upon their grandeur and greatness, and regarding his
   recovery hopeless, treated him as if he had been a dead dog. It is my
   firm conviction, that in this passage he complains both of the
   torturing cruelty of his enemies, and also that his character had been
   unjustly aspersed by calumny and reproach; for we know that he was
   borne down by the malignity and wickedness of those who, being invested
   with authority, boastingly, yet falsely, pretended that they wished to
   act as judges and as the executors of justice, which plausible pretexts
   they adopt as a cloak for their iniquity.

   [294] From the express application of a part of this awfully prophetic
   poem to Judas by the Apostle Peter, (Acts 1:20) we learn that the
   punishment and sufferings of that unhappy man form its subject. It has
   also been justly viewed as shadowing forth, not merely the fate of the
   wretched Iscariot, and his immediate associates, but the dreadful and
   justly-merited destiny of the Jewish polity and nation. "The first five
   verses of this psalm," says Horsley, "clearly describe the treatment
   which our Lord met with from the Jews. The curses that follow as
   clearly describe the judgments which have fallen upon that miserable
   people. So that the whole is a prediction of his sufferings, and of
   their punishment, delivered in the form of complaint and imprecation."
   Whatever, therefore, may be said as to the primary reference of the
   psalm to the lamentations and denunciations poured forth by David, in
   consequence of the perfidy and cruelty of some inveterate foe, Christ
   must be principally understood as the person who gives utterance to
   these lamentations and denunciations, occasioned by the injurious
   treatment he received from his betrayer and murderers. -- [18]See
   Appendix.

   PSALM 110

   In this psalm David sets forth the perpetuity of Christ's reign, and
   the eternity of his priesthood; and, in the first place, he affirms,
   That God conferred upon Christ supreme dominion, combined with
   invincible power, with which he either conquers all his enemies, or
   compels them to submit to him. In the second place, he adds, That God
   would extend the boundaries of this kingdom far and wide; and, in the
   third place, That Christ, having been installed into the priestly
   office with all the solemnity of an oath, sustains the honors of that
   equally with those of his regal office. Finally, That this shall be a
   new order of priesthood, whose introduction shall put an end to the
   Levitical priesthood, which was temporary, and that it shall be
   everlasting.

   A Psalm of David.

   Having the testimony of Christ that this psalm was penned in reference
   to himself, we need not apply to any other quarter for the
   corroboration of this statement; and, even supposing we neither had his
   authority, nor the testimony of the apostle, the psalm itself would
   admit of no other interpretation; [317] for although we should have a
   dispute with the Jews, the most obstinate people in the world, about
   the right application of it, we are able, by the most irresistible
   arguments, to compel them to admit that the truths here stated relate
   neither to David nor to any other person than the Mediator alone. It is
   acknowledged that the kingdom of Christ is typified in the person of
   David, but it cannot be asserted of him, or of any of his successors,
   that he should be a king whose dominion should be widely extended, and
   who, at the same time, was to be a priest, not according to the law,
   but according to the order of Melchizedek, and that for ever; for, at
   that time, no new and unusual priestly dignity could be instituted,
   without depriving the house of Levi of this peculiar honor. Besides,
   the perpetuity which is ascribed to the sacerdotal office cannot belong
   to any man, because, with the exception of the man Christ Jesus, this
   honor terminates immediately at the close of the short and uncertain
   course of the present life. But as these topics will be considered,
   more at large, in their proper place, it is sufficient that we have, at
   this time, briefly alluded to them.

   Psalm 110:1-3

   1. Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make thine
   enemies thy footstool. 2. Jehovah shall send out of Zion the scepter of
   thy power: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 3. Thy people shall
   come with voluntary offerings, at the time of the assembling of thine
   army, [318] in beauty of holiness: [319] from the womb as from the
   morning dawn to thee has been the dew of thy youth.


   1 Jehovah said to my Lord [320] What is here stated might to some
   extent be applied to the person of David, inasmuch as he neither
   ascended the royal throne illegally, nor did he find his way to it by
   nefarious artifices, nor was he raised to it by the fickle suffrages of
   the people, but it was by the direct authority of God that he reigned
   over Israel. It may be justly affirmed of all the kings of the earth,
   that they have been placed upon their thrones by the hand of God, for
   the kingdoms of this world are appointed by the decree of heaven, and
   "there is no power but of God," (Romans 13:1) Besides, as this kingdom
   was altogether peculiar, it was the design of David to make a
   distinction between it and all other kingdoms. God indeed invests kings
   with authority, but they are not consecrated as David was, that like
   him, in consequence of the holy anointing oil, they might be elevated
   to the rank of Christ's vicegerents. In the eighty-second psalm they
   are called gods, because by the will of God they hold their position,
   and in some respects are his representatives, (all power being lodged
   in him;) but they are not clothed with that sacred majesty by which
   David was honored to be a type of God's only begotten Son. Moreover, he
   justly observes that the kingdom was conferred upon him in a totally
   different manner from other earthly kings, who, while they acknowledge
   that it is by the grace of God they reign, yet, at the same time, do
   not consider that they are sustained by his power, but, on the
   contrary, imagine that they reign either by their own policy, by
   hereditary right, or by the kindness of fortune; and, therefore, in so
   far as it respects themselves, it must be affirmed, that they have no
   legitimate title to reign. And since they do not recognize the hand of
   God in what they derive from him, his command cannot be properly
   addressed to them. David, who was well aware that he was anointed by
   God to be king over Israel, and who maintained an obscure and retired
   position until summoned to assume the reins of government, shows good
   cause why he is not to be classed with the ordinary kings of the earth;
   meaning that he reigned by a Divine right. That the whole of what is
   stated in this verse cannot be entirely and exclusively applied to
   David, is very obvious from Christ's reply to the Pharisees, (Matthew
   22:44) They having said that Christ was to be the son of David, he
   saith unto them, "How then doth David himself call him Lord?"

   The objection started by the Jews, that Christ's reply was captious, is
   entirely frivolous, because David does not speak in his own name, but
   in that of the people. This objection is easily repelled. For even
   granting that this psalm was penned in name of the whole Church, yet as
   David himself constituted one of the number of the godly, and was a
   member of the body under the same head, he could not separate himself
   from that class, or be dissevered from this head; what is more, he
   could not compose this psalm for others without, at the same time,
   taking part with them in it. There is besides another thing deserving
   of notice, the assumption of the principle or maxim then generally
   admitted, that David spake by the spirit of prophecy, and consequently
   prophesied of the future reign of Christ. This principle of
   interpretation being admitted, it is plainly to be inferred that he had
   a reference to Christ's future manifestation in the flesh, because he
   is the sole and supreme Head of the Church. From which it also follows,
   that there is something in Christ more excellent than his humanity, on
   account of which he is called the Lord of David his father. This view
   is strengthened by what is stated in the second clause of the verse.
   Earthly kings may indeed be said to sit at God's right hand, inasmuch
   as they reign by his authority; here, however, something more lofty is
   expressed, in that one king is chosen in a peculiar manner, and
   elevated to the rank of power and dignity next to God, of which dignity
   the twilight only appeared in David, while in Christ it shone forth in
   meridian splendor. And as God's right hand is elevated far above all
   angels, it follows that he who is seated there is exalted above all
   creatures. We will not maintain that angels were brought down from
   their high estate to be put in subjection to David. What, then, is the
   result, but that by the spirit of prophecy Christ's throne is exalted
   far above all principalities in heavenly places? The simile is borrowed
   from what is customary among earthly kings, that the person who is
   seated at his right hand is said to be next to him, and hence the Son,
   by whom the Father governs the world, is by this session represented as
   metaphorically invested with supreme dominion.

   Until I make thine enemies thy footstool [321] By these words the
   prophet affirms that Christ would subdue all the opposition which his
   enemies in their tumultuous rage might employ for the subversion of his
   kingdom. At the same time, he intimates that the kingdom of Christ
   would never enjoy tranquillity until he had conquered his numerous and
   formidable enemies. And even should the whole world direct their
   machinations to the overthrow of Christ's royal throne, David here
   declares that it would remain unmoved and unmoveable, while all they
   who rise up against it shall be ruined. From this let us learn that,
   however numerous those enemies may be who conspire against the Son of
   God, and attempt the subversion of his kingdom, all will be unavailing,
   for they shall never prevail against God's immutable purpose, but, on
   the contrary, they shall, by the greatness of his power, be laid
   prostrate at Christ's feet. And as this prediction will not be
   accomplished before the last day, it must be that the kingdom of Christ
   will be assailed by many enemies from time to time until the end of the
   world; and thus by-and-bye it is said, rule thou in the midst of thine
   enemies The particle until does not refer to that which may happen
   after the complete carnage of the enemies of Christ. [322] Paul
   certainly declares that he will then deliver up the kingdom to God,
   even the Father, which he received from him, (1 Corinthians 15:24;) but
   we are not to take these words as denoting that he shall cease to
   reign, and become, as it were, a private individual; we are to regard
   them as describing the manner of his reign, that is, that his Divine
   majesty will be more conspicuous. Moreover, in this passage he is
   speaking solely of the reprobate who fall under Christ's feet to their
   own ruin and destruction. All mankind are naturally opposed to Christ,
   and hence it is, that ere they be brought to yield a willing obedience
   to him, they must be subdued and humbled. This he does with regard to
   some of them whom he afterwards makes partakers with him in his glory;
   while he casts off others, so that they may remain for ever in their
   lost state.

   2 Jehovah shall send out of Zion the scepter of thy power. The Psalmist
   not only confirms, in different terms, what he stated above, but also
   adds, that Christ's kingdom shall be vastly extended, because God would
   make his scepter stretch far and wide. David did indeed render not a
   few of the surrounding nations tributaries to him, but still his
   kingdom, when contrasted with other monarchies, was always confined
   within narrow limits. There is in the words an implied contrast, as if
   he had said, that Christ should not reign as King upon mount Zion only,
   because God would cause his power to extend to the remotest regions of
   the earth. And for this reason it is denominated the scepter of his
   power, [323] and how astonishing was it, that though the whole world
   was leagued in opposition to Christ's kingdom, it yet continued to
   spread and prosper. In a word, David here animates the hearts of the
   godly against being dispirited by the foolhardy attempts on the part of
   those who presume to introduce discord and disorder into the kingdom of
   Christ; for he shows them that God will put forth his invincible power
   for the maintaining of the glory of his sacred throne. What time, then,
   our minds are agitated by various commotions, let us learn confidently
   to repose on this support, that however much the world may rage against
   Christ, it will never be able to hurl him from the right hand of the
   Father. Moreover, as he does not reign on his own account, but for our
   salvation, we may rest assured that we will be protected and preserved
   from all ills under the guardianship of this invincible King. Doubtless
   our condition in this world is connected with many hardships; but as it
   is the will of God that Christ's kingdom should be encompassed with
   many enemies, and that too with the design of keeping us in a state of
   constant warfare, it becomes us to exercise patience and meekness; and
   assured of God's aid, boldly to set at nought the rage of the whole
   world. From this passage we are instructed as to the calling of the
   Gentiles. Because, if God had not told us in this place respecting the
   extension of Christ's kingdom, we would not this day have been classed
   among his people. But as the wall is broken down, (Ephesians 2:14) and
   the gospel promulgated, we have been gathered together into the body of
   the Church, and Christ's power is put forth to uphold and defend us.

   3 Thy people shall come [324] In this verse the Psalmist sets forth the
   honors of Christ's kingdom in relation to the number of his subjects,
   and their prompt and cheerful obedience to his commands. The Hebrew
   term, which he employs, frequently denotes voluntary oblations; but, in
   the present case, it refers to the chosen people, those who are truly
   Christ's flock; declaring that they shall be a willing people,
   spontaneously and cheerfully consecrating themselves to his service. At
   the time of the assembling of thine army, that is to say, as often as
   there shall be a convening of solemn and lawful assemblies, or the king
   shall desire an account of his people; which may be expressed in
   French, au jour des montres, -- in the day of the review. Others render
   it, in the day of thy power; [325] but the former is preferable, for
   when Christ shall wish to assemble his people, immediately they will
   yield a prompt obedience, without being forcibly constrained to it.
   Moreover, for the purpose of assuring us that this, in preference to
   all other kingdoms, was set apart by God for his peculiar services, it
   is added, the beauties or honors of holiness, thereby intimating, that
   all who become Christ's subjects will not approach him as they would do
   an earthly king, but as they would come into the presence of God
   himself, their sole aim being to serve God.

   Out of the womb of the morning, [326] etc. It would not be for
   edification to recount all the interpretations which have been given of
   this clause, for when I have established its true and natural import,
   it would be quite superfluous to enter upon a refutation of others.
   There does not, indeed, appear to me any reason to doubt that, in this
   place, David extols the Divine favor displayed in increasing the number
   of Christ's people; and hence, in consequence of their extraordinary
   increase, he compares the youth or race which would be born to him to
   the dew. [327] As men are struck with astonishment at seeing the earth
   moistened and refreshed with dew, though its descent be imperceptible,
   even so, David declares that an innumerable offspring shall be born to
   Christ, who shall be spread over the whole earth. The youth, therefore,
   which, like the dew-drops, are innumerable, are here designated the dew
   of childhood or of youth. The Hebrew term, yldvt, yalduth, is used as a
   collective noun, that is, a noun which does not point out a single
   individual only, but a community or society. [328] Should any wish to
   attach a more definite and distinct signification to the term, he may
   do so in the following manner: That an offspring, innumerable as the
   dew-drops of the morning, shall issue from his womb. The testimony of
   experience proves that there was good reason for uttering this
   prediction. The multitude who, in so short a time, have been gathered
   together and subjected to Christ's sway, is incredible; the more so, as
   this has been accomplished by the sound of the Gospel alone, and that,
   too, in spite of the formidable opposition of the whole world. Besides,
   it is not surprising that aged persons, who are recently converted to
   Christ, should be designated children newly born, because the spiritual
   birth, according to Peter, makes all the godly become as new-born
   babes, (1 Peter 2:2) To the same purpose are the words of Isaiah,
   (Isaiah 53:10,) that Christ "shall see a seed whose days shall be
   prolonged;" and under his reign the Church has the promise of enjoying
   a season of incalculable fertility. What has been said will serve to
   account for the appellation given to the Church or children of God.
   And, assuredly, it is matter of surprise that there should be any,
   though the number may be few, gathered out of a world lying in ruins,
   and inhabited by the children of wrath; and it is still more
   surprising, that such vast multitudes are regenerated by the Spirit of
   Christ and by the word. At the same time, we would do well to bear in
   mind, that to execute God's commands promptly and cheerfully, and to be
   guided solely by his will, is the peculiar honor and privilege of his
   chosen; for Christ will recognize none as his people, except those who
   willingly take his yoke upon them, and come into his presence at the
   voice of his word. And that no one may imagine that eye-service is a
   proper discharge of his duty, the Psalmist very properly adds, that
   Christ will not be satisfied with mere external ceremony, but that he
   must be worshipped with true reverence, such as he himself instructs us
   to bring into the presence of God.

   [318] "Au temps d'assembler ton exercice." -- Fr.

   [319] Calvin, in pointing this verse, has very properly placed the
   colon after holiness, and not after morning, as in our English Bible.

   [320] "The Lord said unto my Lord. Heb., Jehovah assuredly said unto my
   Adon,' which last word is used for lord in every variety of rank, from
   the master of a family to the sovereign of an empire. In its origin,
   this title seems similar to the Italian cardinal, which means primarily
   a hinge, as Adon does a socket; hence figuratively applied to executive
   magistrates, on whom the government rests, and public affairs turn." --
   Williams.

   [321] The expression is borrowed from the Eastern custom of conquerors
   putting their feet upon the necks of their enemies. See Joshua 10:24.

   [322] "Until I make, etc. It is remarked by Genebrard, that the
   particle d is to be taken emphatically, as if it were equivalent to
   etiam donec, and signifies continuity; not the exception or exclusion
   of future times. Jehovah is, therefore, speaking in substance as
   follows: -- Reign with me even until I make thy enemies thy footstool;
   even at the time which seems opposed to thy kingdom, and when thy
   enemies appear to reign, that is, before I have prostrated thy enemies,
   and have caused them to make submission to thee. After this subjection
   of thy adversaries, it is unnecessary to say, Thou wilt continue to
   reign.' If this be not the force of the passage, then we must suppose
   that the reign of Christ will cease when he has completely subjugated
   the world; which is contrary to what we are taught elsewhere in
   Scripture. The particle is used in a similar manner in Psalm 123:3;
   Deuteronomy 7:24." -- Phillips.

   [323] "The rod of thy strength, or the scepter of thy strength, i.e.,
   thy powerful scepter, the scepter with which thou rulest thy powerful
   kingdom." -- Phillips.

   [324] "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.'
   Voluntaries, a people of voluntarinesses or of liberalities, (as Psalm
   68:10;) that is, shall most freely, willingly, and liberally present
   themselves and their oblations to thee, as Judges 5:9; Acts 11:41
   [sic]; Exodus 25:2; Romans 12:1; Psalm 48:10; 119:108; Song 6:11." --
   Ainsworth. "ndvvt is literally promptitudines, readinesses; so that the
   term being plural and abstract, may be regarded as highly emphatic, as
   if the Psalmist said, Thy people shall be very willing. This noun also
   signifies voluntary oblations. Thus Luther has rendered it by
   williglich opfern In this sense it is found in many passages, as Exodus
   35:29; 36:3; Deuteronomy 23:24, and several other places. It will be
   necessary, if this meaning be assigned to it here, to supply some such
   verb as yvy'. The Psalmist, however, is evidently speaking of a battle,
   and, therefore, the admission of this meaning would be incongruous " --
   Phillips. "Since an army," says Rosenmüller, "is represented in this
   passage as called out to a warlike expedition, we cannot understand
   ndvvt otherwise than as signifying a prompt and willing mind, in which
   sense we find it, Hosea 14:5, ultro, voluntarily, of his own accord,
   Psalm 51:14; Judges 5:2, 9." -- Messianic Psalms, Biblical Cabinet,
   volume 32, page 271.

   [325] "I have rendered the words, vyvm chyld, in the day of thy power;
   and I understand that day as referring to the time when, in consequence
   of Peter's exhortation, three thousand persons made profession of the
   Christian faith." -- Dante on the Messianic Psalms, Biblical Cabinet,
   volume 32, page 318. With this corresponds the interpretation of
   Hammond: "The Messiah, in the former verses, is set upon his throne,
   for the exercise of his regal power, with a sword or scepter in his
   hand; and, as such, he is supposed to rule in the world, to go out to
   conquer and subdue all before him. The army which he makes use of to
   this end is the college of apostles, sent out to preach to all nations;
   and the time of their thus preaching is here called yvm chylk the day
   of his power' or forces,' or army.'" But Queen Elizabeth's translators
   understood the phrase in the same sense as Calvin, rendering it, "The
   people shall come willingly at the time of assembling thine army." In
   like manner, Rosemüller reads, "In the day of thy army; that is," says
   he, "in the day when thou assemblest and leadest forth thine army. The
   word chyl, militia, is here used as in Deuteronomy 11:4; 2 Kings 6:15,
   signifying military forces." -- Ibid. volume 32, page 273.

   [326] "Des la matrice, comme de, l'estoille du matin " -- Fr. "Out of
   the womb, as if from or out of the star of the morning."

   [327] "Among the earliest Greek writers, dew seems to have been a
   figurative expression for the young of any animal. Thus, drosos is used
   by æschylus for an unfledged bird, (Agamemn. 145;) and herse, by Homer,
   for a young lamb or kid, (Od. 1, 222.)" -- Horsley.

   Psalm 110:4

   4. Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent him, [329] Thou art a priest
   for ever, according to the manner of Melchizedek


   4 Jehovah hath sworn This verse is a satisfactory proof that the person
   here spoken of is none other than Christ. When the Jews, with the view
   of mystifying this prediction, render the term kvhn, chohen, a prince,
   their translation is at once feeble and frivolous. I acknowledge,
   indeed, that those of noble descent or of royal blood are in Hebrew
   denominated khnym, chohanim; but would it have been saying any thing to
   the honor of Christ for David merely to give to him the title of a
   chief, which is inferior to that of royal dignity? Besides, what would
   be the import of saying that he was a prince for ever, and according to
   the manner of Melchizedek? There can be no question then, that the Holy
   Ghost here refers to something specific and peculiar, as distinguishing
   and separating this king from all other kings. This, too, is the well
   known title with which Melchizedek was honored by Moses, (Genesis
   14:18) I grant, indeed, that anciently among heathen nations kings were
   wont to exercise the priestly office; but Melchizedek is called "the
   priest of the most high God," in consequence of his devoutly
   worshipping the only true God. Among his own people, however, God did
   not permit the blending of these offices. Hence Uzziah, David's
   legitimate successor, was struck with leprosy because he attempted to
   offer incense to God, (2 Chronicles 26:21.) The circumstances connected
   with the lineage of David were vastly different from those relating to
   Melchizedek. What these are it is not difficult to ascertain, inasmuch
   as in this new King the holy office of the priesthood shall be united
   with the crown and the throne. For assuredly the imperial majesty was
   not so conspicuous in such an obscure prince as Melchizedek, as on that
   account to warrant his being held out as an example above all others.
   Salem, the sole seat of his throne, and where he reigned by sufferance,
   was at that time a small obscure town, so that with regard to him there
   was nothing deserving of notice saving the conjunction of the crown and
   the priesthood. Ambitious of procuring greater reverence for their
   persons, heathen kings aspired after the honor of the sacerdotal
   office; but it was by divine authority that Melchizedek was invested
   with both these functions.

   All dubiety as to this being the meaning of David ought to be banished
   from our minds by the authority of the Apostle. And although the Jews
   may maintain the contrary as obstinately as they please, yet reason
   manifestly declares that the beauty of holiness, to which I formerly
   adverted, is here very clearly described. To this a decisive and
   peculiar mark is appended, which elevates Christ above all other kings
   with regard to the dignity of the priesthood, and which at the same
   time tends to point out the difference between his priesthood and that
   of Levi. In connection with his sacerdotal office, mention is made of
   God's oath, who was not wont to mingle his venerable name with matters
   of minor importance; but, on the contrary, to teach us by his own
   example to swear deliberately and reverently, and never unless in
   weighty and important matters. Admitting, then, that God had sworn that
   the Messiah would be the prince and governor of his people, according
   as Melchizedek was, this would have been nothing else than an
   unbecoming profanation of his name. When, however, it is quite apparent
   that something unusual and peculiar was denoted in this place, we may
   therefore conclude that the priesthood of Christ is invested with great
   importance, seeing that it is ratified by the oath of God. And, in
   fact, it is the very turning point upon which our salvation depends;
   because, but for our reliance on Christ our Mediator, we would be all
   debarred from entering into God's presence. In prayer, too, nothing is
   more needful for us than sure confidence in God, and therefore he not
   only invites us to come to him, but also by an oath hath appointed an
   advocate for the purpose of obtaining acceptance for us in his sight.
   As for those who shut the door against themselves, they subject
   themselves to the guilt of impeaching him with being a God of untruth
   and of perjury. It is in this way that the Apostle argues the
   disannulling of the Levitical priesthood; because, while that remained
   entire, God would not have sworn that there should be a new order of
   priesthood unless some change had been contemplated. What is more, when
   he promises a new priest, it is certain that he would be one who would
   be superior to all others, and would also abolish the then existing
   order.

   Some translate the term dvrty, diberathi, according to my word, [330]
   an interpretation which I am not disposed entirely to reject, inasmuch
   as David would be represented as affirming that the priesthood of
   Melchizedek is founded upon the call and commandment of God. But as the
   letter y, yod, is frequently redundant, I, in common with the majority
   of interpreters, prefer translating it simply manner. Moreover, as not
   a few of the fathers have misapprehended the comparison between Christ
   and Melchizedek, we must learn from the Apostle what that resemblance
   is; from which will be readily seen the error into which they fell
   respecting it. For can there be any thing more absurd than to overlook
   all the mysteries about which the Spirit, by the mouth of the Apostle,
   hath spoken, and attend only to such as he has omitted? Such persons
   argue solely about the bread and wine, which they maintain were offered
   both by Melchizedek and Christ. But Melchizedek offered bread and wine,
   not as a sacrifice to God, but to Abraham as a repast to refresh him on
   his march. "In the holy Supper there is not an offering of bread and
   wine as they erroneously imagine, but a mutual participation of it
   among the faithful. As to the passage under review, the similitude
   refers principally to the perpetuity of his priesthood, as is obvious
   from the particle lvlm, leolam, that is to say, for ever. Melchizedek
   is described by Moses as if he were a celestial individual; and,
   accordingly, David, in instituting a resemblance between Christ and
   him, designs to point out the perpetuity of his priestly office. Whence
   it follows, (a point which is handled by the Apostle,) that as death
   did not intercept the exercise of his office, he has no successor. And
   this circumstance demonstrates the accursed sacrilege of the Popish
   mass; for, if the Popish priests will assume the prerogative of
   effecting a reconciliation between God and men, they must of necessity
   denude Christ of the peculiar and distinguishing honor which his Father
   has conferred upon him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [329] The addition, "and will not repent," is intended to indicate the
   absolute character of the oath, that it cannot be annulled or suspended
   in consequence of any altered circumstances; that no change of counsel
   or of conduct in the parties concerned shall cause any change in the
   divine purpose, so that it may be said, Jehovah repented, as he is said
   to have repented of creating man on observing the wickedness of the
   human race, (Genesis 6:6.) A similar form of expression is elsewhere
   employed to express the immutability of what God declares or swears,
   (Numbers 23:19; 1 Samuel 15:29.)

   [330] "l dvrty Secundum meam constitutionem, (q. d.,) Not according to

   Psalms, with Notes.

   Psalm 110:5-7

   5. The Lord at thy right hand [331] hath broken in pieces kings in the
   day of his wrath. 6. He shalt judge among the heathen, he shall fill
   all with ruins; he shall break the head over a great country. 7. He
   shall drink of the torrent in the way, and therefore shall he elevate
   his head on high.


   5. The Lord at thy right hand In these words David celebrates the
   dreadful nature of that power which Christ possesses for the dispersion
   and destruction of his enemies; and by this means he affirms, that
   though encompassed by bands of deadly foes, yet their malignant
   attempts would not prevent God from upholding the King whom he has set
   up. It is proper to consider the expression, in the day of his wrath,
   by which we are instructed patiently to endure the cross, if it happen
   that God, for a time, conceals himself during the prevalence of the
   cruelty and fury of enemies; for he knows well when the full and fit
   season arrives for executing vengeance upon them. Next, he invests
   Christ with power over the nations, and the people of uncircumcised
   lips; meaning, that he was not chosen King to reign over the
   inhabitants of Judea only, but also to keep under his sway distant
   nations, agreeably to what was predicated of him in Psalm 2:8. And
   because, in all parts of the earth, as well as in the confines of
   Judea, there would be many rebellious and disobedient persons, he
   adverts also to their destruction; thus intimating, that all who should
   set themselves in opposition to Christ, must be made to fall before
   him, and their obstinacy be subdued.

   7 He shall drink Not a few interpreters, in my opinion, expound this
   verse in a very harsh manner: that the carnage would be so great, as to
   cause the blood of the slain to flow in torrents, out of which Christ,
   the Conqueror, might drink till he was satiated. [332] Akin to this is
   the exposition of those who would have it to be a figurative
   representation of misery and grief, and thus descriptive of the many
   afflictions to which Christ was liable during this transitory life. The
   similitude seems rather to be drawn from the conduct of brave and
   powerful generals, who, when in hot pursuit of the enemy, do not suffer
   themselves to be diverted from their purpose by attending to luxuries;
   but, without kneeling down, are content to quench their thirst by
   drinking of the stream which they are passing. It was in this way that
   Gideon found out the brave and warlike soldiers; regarding such as
   kneeled down to drink as destitute of courage, he sent them back to
   their homes, Judges 7:5. It therefore appears to me that David
   figuratively attributes military prowess to Christ, declaring that he
   would not take time to refresh himself, but would hastily drink of the
   river which might come in his way. [333] This is designed to strike his
   enemies with terror, intimating to them the rapid approach of impending
   destruction. Should any one be disposed to ask, Where then is that
   spirit of meekness and gentleness with which the Scripture elsewhere
   informs us he shall be endued? Isaiah 42:2, 3; 61:1, 2; I answer, that,
   as a shepherd is gentle towards his flock, but fierce and formidable
   towards wolves and thieves; in like manner, Christ is kind and gentle
   towards those who commit themselves to his care, while they who
   wilfully and obstinately reject his yoke, shall feel with what awful
   and terrible power he is armed. In Psalm 2:9, we saw that he had in his
   hand an iron scepter, by which he will beat down all the obduracy of
   his enemies; and, accordingly, he is here said to assume the aspect of
   cruelty, with the view of taking vengeance upon them. Wherefore it
   becomes us carefully to refrain from provoking his wrath against us by
   a stiff-necked and rebellious spirit, when he is tenderly and sweetly
   inviting us to come to him.

   [331] "The Lord at thy right hand. In this psalm it is evident, verse
   1, that yhvh is the title of God the Father, and so again, verse 4, and
   'dny of the Messiah God the Son, in respect of that dignity, and
   dominion, and regal power, to which he was to be exalted at his
   ascension, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.' This is
   expressed, verse 1, by his sitting at God's right hand,' for which the
   Apostle, 1 Corinthians 15:25, reads, it must be that he reign.' By this
   it is evident that, in this verse, The Lord at thy right hand,' must be
   understood of the Messiah instated in his regal power at the right hand
   of his father, and not of the Father as his parastates, to back and
   help him, as Psalm 16:8, and elsewhere, the phrase is used. For of the
   Son thus exalted we know it is that we read John 5:22, that the Father
   has committed all judgment to the Son.' Agreeable to which it is that
   this Adonai,' or Lord at Jehovah's right hand here, shall strike
   through kings in the day of his wrath;' i.e., shall act revenges most
   severely on the opposers of his kingdom; which revenges, in the New
   Testament, are peculiarly attributed to Christ, and called the coming
   of the Son of Man, coming in the clouds, coming with his angels, and
   the approaching or coming of his kingdom.'" -- Hammond. In this 5th
   verse the Psalmist makes a sudden apostrophe to Jehovah. Horsley is
   much inclined to indulge in a conjecture, which Dr Kennicott, too,
   seems to have entertained, that the word yhvh, Jehovah, has been lost
   out of the text after the original word for at thy right hand; and that
   the passage should run thus: "The Lord at thy right hand, O Jehovah!"

   [332] This opinion is held by Michaelis and Doederlein. But although a
   fearful carnage of God's and his people's enemies is sometimes
   poetically described by His arrows being made drunk with blood,
   Deuteronomy 32:42; and as producing a stream of blood, in which his
   people, victorious over them, might dip or wash their feet, as in Psalm
   68:24; yet neither He nor they are said to drink such blood. There is a
   great difference between this latter and the two preceding metaphors;
   and we cannot think that the idea of drinking human blood, much less of
   making God drink it, would have entered the mind of any Israelite. The
   idea is abhorrent to human nature, and must have appeared particularly
   shocking to the Jews, who were strictly prohibited by the laws of Moses
   from eating even the blood of beasts.

   [333] Similar is the opinion of Grotius. He regards the words as
   containing a description of a strenuous and active warrior, whom no
   obstacle can prevent from prosecuting victory with the utmost ardor;
   "Who," to use his own language, "when pursuing the enemy, does not seek
   for places of entertainment, that he may refresh himself with wine, but
   is contented with water, which he takes hastily in passing; and
   whenever he can find it, not only from a river, but from a torrent."
   "Schnurrer," says Rosemüller, "seems to have perceived the true meaning
   of the verse, which he gives in the following words: -- Though fatigued
   with the slaughter of his enemies, yet will he not desist; but, having
   refreshed himself with water taken from the nearest stream, will exert
   his renovated strength in the pursuit of the routed foe.'" -- Messianic
   Psalms, page 284.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [317] In Matthew 22:42-45, Christ applies this portion of Scripture to
   himself; and this application the Pharisees, before whom it was made,
   so far from disputing, at once admitted, as appears from their
   inability to answer our Lord's question, which was founded upon it; for
   had the psalm been differently interpreted by any party among the Jews,
   the Pharisees would unquestionably have taken advantage of such
   diversity of opinion, to escape from the difficulty in which they were
   placed by the question addressed to them. The Messianic interpretation
   of this psalm is also supported by the testimony of the apostles. The
   author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 1:13) quotes the first
   verse, to prove Christ's superiority in dignity to angels, to whom
   Jehovah had never said, "Sit on my right hand, until I make thine
   enemies thy footstool." In Acts 2:34, 35, Peter quotes the same
   passage, as prophetical of Christ's ascension into heaven. See also 1
   Corinthians 15:25; Hebrews 7:17; Ephesians 1:20, etc. The psalm is thus
   beyond all controversy, a very clear prediction of the divinity,
   priesthood, victories, and triumph of the Messiah. We have so many
   Scriptural helps to its exposition, that we can be at no loss as to its
   meaning. Such also is the strength of the internal evidence, in support
   of its application to Christ, that although the Jews have taken a great
   deal of pains to wrest it to another sense, yet several of the Rabbins
   have been forced to acknowledge that it belongs to him.

   PSALM 111 [334]

   The title to this psalm supplies the place of an argument; and, that
   others may be induced to engage in the praises of God, the Psalmist
   points out the manner of doing so by his own example. Then he gives a
   short account of the manifold benefits which, in olden times, he
   conferred upon the faithful, and is daily conferring upon them. The
   psalm is composed in alphabetical order, each verse containing two
   letters. The first verse begins with a, ' aleph, while the letter b, v
   beth, is placed at the commencement of the next half of the verse. The
   last two verses only are not divided into hemistiches; but each of
   these has three letters. If, however, any one will closely examine the
   contents, he will find that this has occurred through mistake or
   inadvertence; for if we make these two verses into three, [335] the
   construction of the sentences corresponds very well one with another;
   and consequently, the transcribers have erred in not attending to the
   prophet's distinction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 111:1-4

   1. Praise ye Jehovah. [336] (', aleph,) I will praise Jehovah with my
   whole heart, (v, beth) In the congregation and assembly of the just. 2.
   (g, gimel,) The works of Jehovah are great, (d, daleth,) Sought out of
   all who have a desire to them. 3. (h, he,) His work is beautiful and
   magnificent: (v, vau,) And his justice endureth for ever. 4. (z, zain,)
   He hath caused his marvellous works to be remembered: (ch, cheth,)
   Jehovah is compassionate and merciful.


   1 I will praise Jehovah The best and most efficient method of
   inculcating the performance of any duty is to be exemplary; and,
   accordingly, we find that the prophet, in the present instance, sets
   himself for an example, to lead others to engage in the celebration of
   God's praises. His resolution to praise God consists of two parts; that
   he would celebrate God's praises unfeignedly, with all his heart, and
   that he would do it publicly, in the assembly of the faithful. He very
   properly begins with heart-praise, because it is much better to praise
   in secret, and when no one is conscious of it, than to lift up our
   voice, and shout forth his praises with feigned lips. At the same time,
   the person who, in secret, pours out his heart in grateful emotions
   towards God, will also set forth his praises in swelling strains,
   otherwise God would be deprived of one half of the honor which is due
   to him. The prophet then determines to praise God with the whole heart,
   that is, with an upright and honest heart; not that he engages to come
   up to the full measure of his duty, but he declares that he would not
   be like the hypocrites, who, coldly and with a double heart, or rather
   guilefully and perfidiously, employ their lips only in the praises of
   God. This is a point worthy of notice, lest any should be discouraged,
   in consequence of not being able to cherish the hope of attaining to
   that perfection of heart which is so desirable; for however defective
   our praises may be, they may nevertheless be acceptable to God,
   provided only we strive unfeignedly to render unto him this act of
   devotion. We come now to the other part of his resolution, in which he
   says he would proclaim the praises of God before men; for although the
   Hebrew term svd, sod, denotes a private assembly, [337] yet I think
   that, in this passage, he employs two words of synonymous import. At
   the same time, should any one be inclined to take a more refined view
   of the passage, he may do so if he please. He says, in the congregation
   of the just, because the principal object for which holy assemblies are
   convened, is to afford the worshippers of God an opportunity of
   presenting to him sacrifices of praise, agreeably to what is stated in
   Psalm 65:1,

   "Praise waits for thee, O Jehovah! in Zion."

   2 The works of Jehovah are great He now proceeds to inform us that
   there are abundant materials for praising God, supplied by his works,
   to which at present he makes only a general reference, and which he,
   subsequently, defines more explicitly in relation to the government of
   the Church. The magnitude of God's works is a subject which, generally,
   eludes the observation of men, and, therefore, few of them are
   acquainted with it. This ignorance the prophet ascribes to the
   indifference and ingratitude of men, comparatively few of whom
   condescend to notice the great wisdom, goodness, justice, and power,
   which shine forth in these works. Expositors are divided in their
   sentiments about the second clause of the verse. Some translate it,
   sought out for all their delights; and, indeed, the Hebrew term chphph,
   chaphets, signifies good pleasure; but as this is too harsh an
   interpretation of the word, it is better to understand it as an
   adjective, expressing the idea of loving or desiring. As to the
   participle, sought out, which, according to the Hebrew verb, drs,
   darash, properly denotes, to search with diligence, we yet find that
   the works of Jehovah are, in this place, called drvsym, derushim, that
   is, perceived or found out. Hence, in Isaiah 65:1, it is said, "I was
   found of them who sought, me not." I must, however, not lose sight of
   the prophet's design, namely, that in consequence of so few applying
   themselves to the study of the works of God, he teaches us that that is
   the reason why so many are blind amidst a flood of light; for, when he
   says that the excellency of the works of God is known to all who desire
   it, he means that none are ignorant of it, except such as are wilfully
   blind, or rather, malignantly and contemptuously quench the light which
   is offered to them. We must, however, attend to the means which we
   possess for arriving at the knowledge of these words because we know,
   that as long as the faithful are on earth, their understandings are
   dull and weak, so that they cannot penetrate the mysteries, or
   comprehend the height of the works of God. But, incomprehensible as is
   the immensity of the wisdom, equity, justice, power, and mercy of God,
   in his works, the faithful nevertheless acquire as much knowledge of
   these as qualifies them for manifesting the glory of God; only it
   becomes us to begin the study of his works with reverence, that we may
   take delight in them, contemptible though they be in the estimation of
   the reprobate, who treat them with impious scorn. The LXX. having
   rendered it, sought out in all his wills, Augustine has therefore taken
   occasion, with philosophic finesse, to ask, How can there be, or, at
   least, appear to be, a plurality of wills in God? And it is indeed a
   pleasing consideration, that though God manifest his will in his law,
   nevertheless there is another secret purpose by which he is guided in
   the wonderful management of human affairs. This doctrine, however, is,
   foreign to the exposition of this passage.

   3 His work is beautiful Others render it splendor. The meaning of the
   clause is this, That every act of God is replete with glorious majesty.
   In the following part of the verse he specifies more clearly in what
   this beauty and magnificence consist, by stating that the justice of
   God is everywhere conspicuous. It is not the design of God to furnish
   us with such a display of his power and sovereignty in his works, as
   might only fill our minds with terror, but he also gives us a display
   of his justice in a manner so inviting as to captivate our hearts. This
   commendation of the works and ways of God is introduced in opposition
   to the clamor and calumny of the ungodly, by which they impiously
   endeavor, to the utmost extent of their power, to disfigure and deface
   the glory of the works of God. In the next verse, he more especially
   extols the wonderful works in which God has principally set forth his
   power. To cause his marvellous works to be remembered, is equivalent to
   the doing of works worthy of being remembered, or the renown of which
   shall continue for ever. [338] And having above called upon us to
   contemplate his justice, now, in like manner, and almost in like terms,
   he celebrates the grace and mercy of God, principally in relation to
   his works, because that justice which he displays in the preservation
   and protection of his people, issues from the source of his unmerited
   favor which he bears towards them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [336] The Hebrew for Praise ye Jehovah is Hallelujah. This is probably
   the title, and no part of the psalm itself. The alphabetical
   construction of the poem seems to confirm this opinion. It is acrostic,
   and begins with aleph, and each succeeding hemistich commences with the
   other letters of the alphabet in order; but were Hallelujah, which
   begins with the fifth letter of the alphabet, answering to our H, the
   first word of the psalm, that would destroy its perfectly alphabetical
   character.

   [337] "Aben Ezra and others think that dh is put in opposition to svd,
   which denotes a more secret assembly; and so the verse, they say,
   means, in substance, as follows: I will praise the Lord with all my
   heart, both privately and publicly.' This, however, I think can
   scarcely be the sense: it is much more likely that svd is here employed
   to express a congregation of Israelites; because the rest of the world
   was excluded from such assembly, and so far it partook of the character
   of private or secret. This is the view taken by Luther, whose
   paraphrase of this verse is as follows: I thank the Lord here in this
   public assembly, where we (Israelites) meet one another as in private
   counsel, and where no heathen nor strangers can be present.'" --
   Phillips.

   [338] "zkr sh. He hath made a memorial for himself in his wonderful
   works. zkr, the same as zkrvn in Numbers 17:5. So the LXX., in Exodus
   17:14, render zkr by onoma, name; accordingly, zkr sh may signify, He
   hath made himself a name; i.e., His wonderful works will exist as
   memorials of his name." -- Phillips.

   Psalm 111:5-8

   5. (t, teth,) He hath given a portion to them that fear him: (y, yod,)
   He will remember his covenant for ever. 6. (k, caph,) He hath declared
   to his people the power of his works, (l, lamed,) To give the heritage
   of the heathen to them. 7. (m, mem,) The works of his hands are truth
   and judgment; (n, nun,) All his statutes are true. 8. (s, samech,) They
   are established for ever, (, ain,) And are done in truth and
   righteousness.


   5 He hath given a portion to them that fear him The Church being a
   mirror of the grace and justice of God, what the prophet said
   respecting them is here expressly applied to her; not that he designs
   to treat of the justice of God, in general, but only of that which he
   peculiarly displays towards his own people. Hence he adds, that God's
   care of his people is such as to lead him to make ample provision for
   the supply of all their wants. The word trph, tereph, which we have
   translated portion, is frequently taken for a prey: [339] others render
   it meat; but I rather choose to render it portion, in which sense it is
   taken in Proverbs 30:8, and Proverbs 31:15; as if he should say, that
   God had given his people all that was needful, and that, considered as
   a portion, it was large and liberal; for we know that the people of
   Israel were enriched, not in consequence of their own industry, but by
   the blessing of God, who, like the father of a family, bestows upon his
   household every thing necessary for their subsistence. In the following
   clause of the verse, he assigns as the reason for his care and
   kindness, his desire of effectually demonstrating that his covenant was
   not null and void. And here it must be carefully observed, that if, in
   former times, and from a respect to his gracious covenant, he
   manifested so great kindness towards the people of Israel, in like
   manner, the goodness which we receive from him is the result of our
   adoption into his family; and because God is never weary in showing
   kindness to his people, he says that the remembrance of his covenant
   shall never be effaced. Moreover, as he daily and constantly loads us
   with his benefits, so our faith must, in some measure, correspond with
   it: it must not fail, but must rise above life and death.

   The next verse is subjoined, by way of exposition, for the purpose of
   showing that God, in bestowing upon his people the heritage of the
   heathen, had manifested to them the power of his works. He does indeed
   employ the term show, but he means a true showing; because the
   possession of the Holy Land was not acquired by mere human power, but
   it was given to them by Divine power, and through the working of many
   miracles; and thus God, as it were, openly testified to the descendants
   of Abraham with what incomparable power he is invested. It is on this
   account that he sets up the people of Israel as a match for so many
   other nations, who would assuredly never have vanquished so many
   enemies, unless they had been sustained from on high.

   7 The works of his hands In the first clause of the verse he exclaims
   that God is known to be faithful and upright in his works, and then he
   goes on to extol the same truth and rectitude as pervading the doctrine
   of the law; the amount of which is, that a beautiful harmony
   characterises all the sayings and doings of God, because every where he
   shows himself to be just and faithful. We have a memorable proof of
   this fact in the redemption of his ancient people. Yet I doubt not,
   that, under the term, works, the prophet comprehends the constant
   government of the Church; because God daily and unceasingly shows that
   he is just and true, and unweariedly pursues the same course. Among men
   it is reckoned to be of more importance for one to be found just in
   practice than in profession; yet, as the doctrine of the law was the
   very life and safety of the people, the prophet very properly, and in
   several expressions, dwells upon the sentiment contained in the second
   clause of the verse; saying, all his statutes are true, they are
   established for ever, and are drawn up in perfect accordance with the
   strict law of truth and equity And assuredly, but for God's having kept
   the people united to him by the sacred chain of the law, the fruit of
   their redemption would have been very small, and even that benefit
   would have soon been lost by them. We ought to observe, then, that this
   subject is brought prominently forward in this place; because, in
   attesting the eternal love of God, it became the means of imparting
   life.

   [339] "Given meat -- Heb., Prey;' i.e., food. Some think this refers to
   the manna rained upon Israel in the wilderness; we should rather think,
   to the quails. See Psalm 105:40." -- Williams. "trph. This word is
   usually translated prey, and the passage is thought, by some, to refer
   to the spoiling of the Egyptians by the Israelites, mentioned in Exodus
   12:36. It is, however, more probable that trph signifies here food, and
   that allusion is made to the manna with which the children of Israel
   were fed in the wilderness. See Proverbs 31:15; Malachi 3:10. The first
   hemistich is the consequence of what is stated in the second; i.e.,
   because God remembered his covenant, therefore he gave food to them who
   fear him." -- Phillips.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 111:9-10

   9. (ph, phe,) He sent redemption to his people; (ts, tzaddi,) he hath
   commanded His covenant for ever: (q, koph,) holy and terrible is his
   name. 10. (r, resh,) The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom:
   (s, schin,) good understanding have all they who do these things: (t,
   tau,) his praise endureth for ever.


   9 He sent redemption to his people What he had already stated is here
   repeated in different words. And as the deliverance of his people was
   the commencement of their salvation, it is first introduced; next is
   subjoined its confirmation in the law, by reason of which it comes to
   pass that God's adoption could never fail. For though, long prior to
   this, God had established his covenant with Abraham, which also was the
   occasion of the redemption of the people; yet what is here mentioned
   refers exclusively to the law, by which the covenant was ratified,
   never to be disannulled. The amount is, that, in the deliverance of the
   people, God did not act the part of a beneficial father, merely for a
   day, but that, in the promulgation of the law, he also establishedhis
   grace, that the hope of eternal life might continue for ever in the
   Church. Moreover, you must attend carefully to what I have elsewhere
   cautioned you against, and to which I shall advert more at length on
   [19]Psalm 119, where the law is spoken of, That the commandments must
   not be taken always abstractly, for the Holy Spirit, in an especial
   manner, refers to the promises which are in Christ, by which God, in
   gathering his chosen people to himself, hath begotten them again to
   eternal life.

   10. The fear of Jehovah Having treated of the kindness of God, and paid
   a well-merited tribute to the law, the prophet goes on to exhort the
   faithful to reverence God, and be zealous in the keeping of the law. In
   calling the fear of God, The beginning or source of wisdom, he charges
   with folly those who do not render implicit obedience unto God. As if
   he should say, They who fear not God, and do not regulate their lives
   according to his law, are brute beasts: and are ignorant of the first
   elements of true wisdom. To this we must carefully attend; for although
   mankind generally wish to be accounted wise almost all the world
   lightly esteem God, and take pleasure in their own wicked craftiness.
   And as the very worst of men are reputed to be superior to all others
   in point of wisdom; and, puffed up with this confidence, harden
   themselves against God, the prophet declares all the wisdom of the
   world, without the fear of God, to be vanity or an empty shadow. And,
   indeed, all who are ignorant of the purpose for which they live are
   fools and madmen. But to serve God is the purpose for which we have
   been born, and for which we are preserved in life. There is, therefore,
   no worse blindness, no insensibility so grovelling, as when we contemn
   God, and place our affections elsewhere. For whatever ingenuity the
   wicked may possess, they are destitute of the main thing, genuine
   piety. To the same effect are the words which immediately follow, a
   good understanding have all they who keep God's commandments. There is
   great emphasis upon the qualifying adjunct tvv, tob; because the
   prophet, in inveighing against the foolish opinion to which we have
   already adverted, tacitly condemns those who delight in their own
   wicked craftiness. His meaning is, I admit, that they are usually
   deemed wise who look well to their own interests, who can pursue a
   temporising policy, who have the acuteness and artifice of preserving
   the favorable opinion of the world, and who even practice deception
   upon others. But even were I to grant that this character belongs to
   them, yet is their wisdom unprofitable and perverse, because true
   wisdom manifests itself in the observance of the law. Next he
   substitutes the keeping of God's commandments for the fear of God. For
   though all men, without exception, boast that they fear God, yet
   nothing is more common than for them to live in the neglect of his law.
   Hence the prophet very properly inculcates upon us the voluntary
   assumption of his yoke, and submission to the regulations of his word,
   as the most satisfactory evidence of our living in the fear of God. The
   term beginning [340] has misled some, leading them to imagine that the
   fear of God was denominated the entrance of wisdom, as it were the
   alphabet, because it prepares men for true piety. Such an opinion is
   scarcely deserving of notice, seeing that, in Job 28:28, it is called
   "wisdom." In this passage fear is not to be understood as referring to
   the first or elementary principles of piety, as in 1 John 4:18, but is
   comprehensive of all true godliness, or the worship of God. The
   conclusion of the psalm requires no explanation; it being the object of
   the prophet simply to inculcate upon the faithful, that nothing is more
   profitable for them, than to spend their lives in the celebration of
   the praises of God.

   [334] This and the subsequent psalms, to the 119th, are supposed to
   have been sung by the Jews at the celebration of the Passover; and the
   subject-matter of them was peculiarly adapted to such a purpose. "From
   the 111th to the 118th psalm, inclusive," says Jebb, in his recent work
   on the Psalms, "we find very interesting marks of a ceremonial which,
   tradition asserts, was observed by the Jews at the eating of the
   Passover, namely, the singing of the Gospel Hallel -- that hymn, in all
   likelihood, which our blessed Lord sang with his disciples after the
   Last Supper. Dr Lightfoot informs us that there is considerable
   discrepancy of opinion among the Jews as to what psalms constituted the
   Greater Hallel; the various opinions extending or contracting its range
   from the 113th to the 137th psalm. As usual, these traditions are
   uncertain and ill defined, and have more respect to the arbitrary dicta
   of the Rabbins than to the internal evidence of Holy Scripture. Let us
   now examine this evidence. In the first place, we are to remark, that
   all the psalms (except the 114th and 118th) which precede the 119th,
   have Hallelujah (that is, Praise ye the Lord) either prefixed or
   subjoined, or both, while those which are without this burden are in
   evident connection; the 119th as evidently beginning a new series. In
   the absence, then, of any consistent testimony, it seems fair to
   assume, that this group of psalms formed the Greater Hallel, the
   sentiment they contain being singularly applicable to the festival, --
   to the great deliverance from Egypt, which it celebrated, and to the
   second delivery from Babylon, which so strongly resembled it. According
   to Dr Lightfoot, the 113th and 114th psalms were sung at one period of
   the feast, at the second cup; and after the fourth cup, the other
   psalms, namely, the 115th to the 118th, inclusive; and here the feast
   ordinarily ended. They thus held the place of grace before or after
   meat; and this division is very consistent, the latter psalms being
   more evidently Eucharistical." -- Jebb's Literal Translation of the
   Book of Psalms, with Dissertations, volume 2, pages 269-271.

   [335] "These two verses," says Dr Geddes, "might just as well have made
   three, and then the whole of both psalms would be regular." According
   to Jerome, this is the first psalm that is exactly alphabetical, the
   rest of this description, which precede it, being only nearly so.

   PSALM 112

   As the majority of mankind expect to prosper by evil deeds, and as they
   generally endeavor to enrich themselves by plunder, fraud, and every
   species of injustice, the prophet enumerates the blessings of God which
   attend those who worship him in purity, in order that we may know that,
   in aiming at a life of piety and morality, we shall not lose our
   reward. [341]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 112:1-3

   1. Praise ye Jehovah! Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah; he will
   greatly delight in his commandments. 2. His seed shall be powerful in
   the earth: [342] the generation of the righteous shall be blessed. 3.
   Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
   for ever.


   1 Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah Although the prophet begins
   with an exhortation, he has, as I have already pointed out, something
   farther in view, than simply the calling upon the faithful to praise
   God. To practice wickedness, and perpetrate injustice, is, in all
   quarters, accounted a great happiness; and, although integrity may be
   occasionally praised, nevertheless, there is scarcely one among a
   hundred who pursues it, because all imagine that they will be miserable
   unless, by one means or another, they seize as booty every thing which
   comes in their way. In opposition to this, the prophet tells us that
   more advantage is to be expected from God's paternal regard, than from
   the inflicting of every species of injury, and the perpetrating of
   every kind of injustice in our power; and by setting before us the
   certain hope of reward, he calls us back to the practice of equity and
   beneficence. The following is the analysis which I give of the verse:
   Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, and delighteth himself in his
   commandments; and thus, by the second clause of the verse, the prophet
   specifies in what the fear of God consists. And that the addition of
   this explanatory clause is called for, is quite apparent from what we
   remarked towards the conclusion of the preceding psalm. For, while the
   law is boldly contemned by mankind, yet nothing is more common than to
   pretend that they fear God. Such impiety is well refuted by the
   prophet, when he acknowledges none as belonging to the worshippers of
   God, but he who endeavors to keep his law. The Hebrew verb chphph,
   chaphets, is rather emphatical, which is, as it were, to take his
   pleasure, and I have rendered to delight himself For the prophet makes
   a distinction between a willing and prompt endeavor to keep the law,
   and that which consists in mere servile and constrained obedience. We
   must, therefore, cheerfully embrace the law of God, and that, too, in
   such a manner, that the love of it, with all its sweetness, may
   overcome all the allurements of the flesh, otherwise, mere attention to
   it will be unavailing. Hence a man cannot be regarded as a genuine
   observer of the law, until he has attained to this -- that the delight
   which he takes in the law of God renders obedience agreeable to him. I
   now resume the consideration of the passage at large. The prophet, in
   affirming that the worshippers of God are happy, guards us against the
   very dangerous deception which the ungodly practice upon themselves, in
   imagining that they can reap a sort of happiness, I know not what, from
   doing evil.

   2 His seed shall be powerful For the purpose of confirming the
   statement which he advanced respecting the happiness of the man that
   fears Jehovah and takes delight in his commandments, the prophet
   enumerates the tokens of God's loving-kindness, which he is wont to
   bestow upon his worshippers. And, in the first place, he says that
   God's fatherly kindness is not confined to their own persons, it also
   extends to their posterity: agreeably to what is said in the law, "I am
   merciful to a thousand generations, towards them that love me and keep
   my commandments," Exodus 34:7. And in Psalm 103:8, 9, and other
   passages, we have formerly adverted to this doctrinal statement. As,
   however, not a few are disposed to pervert this doctrine, by applying
   it as the standard according to which God dispenses his temporal
   favors, it is therefore proper to bear in mind what I have said in
   Psalm 37:25, that these are bestowed according to the manner, and in
   the measure, which God pleases. Sometimes it happens that a good man is
   childless; and barrenness itself is considered a curse of God. Again,
   many of God's servants are oppressed with poverty and want, are borne
   down under the weight of sickness, and harassed and perplexed with
   various calamities. It is therefore necessary to keep this general
   principle in view, That God sometimes bestows his bounty more
   profusely, and, at other times, more sparingly, upon his children,
   according as he sees it to be most for their good; and, moreover, he
   sometimes conceals the tokens of his kindness, apparently as if he had
   no regard for his people at all. Still, amid this perplexity, it
   constantly appears that these words were not uttered in vain, the
   righteous and their offspring are blessed God very frequently blasts
   the vain hopes of the ungodly, whose sole object is to bear rule in the
   world, and to raise their children to places of wealth and honor. On
   the other hand, as the faithful are satisfied with bringing up their
   children in the fear of God, and contented to live sparingly, God, as
   it were with an outstretched hand, exalts them to honor. Add to this,
   that anciently, under the law, the truth of this doctrine was more
   evident; because it was requisite for a people inexperienced and
   feeble, to be trained gradually, by means of temporal benefits, to
   entertain a better hope. And in our times, but for our vices, God's
   temporal kindness would shine more brightly upon us. For experience
   demonstrates that what is immediately subjoined does not uniformly hold
   true, wealth and riches shall be in the houses of the righteous It is
   no uncommon occurrence for the virtuous and holy to suffer hunger, and
   to be in want even of the most homely fare; and, for this reason, it
   would not be for their good were God to bestow more earthly benefits
   upon them. In afflicting circumstances, numbers of them would be
   incapable of behaving in a manner becoming their profession. In the
   meantime, we may observe, that the grace which the prophet commends
   appears principally in this, that the good and sincere are satisfied
   with their humble estate, whereas no portion, however large, even to
   the extent of the world itself, will content the ungodly worldling. The
   old adage holds true, That the covetous wants that which he has, as
   well as that which he has not; because he is master of nothing, and is
   the slave of his own wealth. In connection with this clause must also
   be taken that which follows, the righteousness of good men endureth for
   ever This, in fact, constitutes the true and proper difference between
   the godly and ungodly; because the latter may, for a time, hoard up
   immense wealth; yet, all that shall, according to the words of the
   prophet, "suddenly vanish away at the blast of the Almighty," Haggai
   1:9. And we daily see that what has been acquired by violence and
   deceit, becomes the prey and property of others. But, to the faithful,
   their integrity is the best and surest preserver of God's blessings.

   Psalm 112:4-8

   4. Light ariseth [343] in darkness to the righteous: he is gracious,
   merciful, and just. 5. A good man [344] showeth pity, and lendeth: he
   manages his affairs uprightly. 6. Surely he shall not be moved for
   ever: the just shall be held in perpetual remembrance. 7. He shall not
   be afraid when he hears evil tidings: his heart is fixed, because he
   confides in Jehovah. 8. His heart is established, he shall not be
   afraid, until [345] he see his desire [346] upon his enemies.


   4 Light ariseth The Hebrew verb zrch, zarach, may be taken
   intransitively, as I have inserted it in the text, or transitively, as
   in the marginal reading; in either way the signification is the same.
   Whichsoever of these translations you adopt, the words are susceptible
   of a twofold interpretation; either, that as the sun shines on one part
   of the earth, and all the other parts of it are enveloped in darkness,
   so God exempts the righteous from the common calamities of human life;
   or, as day succeeds night, so God, though he permit the hearts of his
   servants to be in heaviness for a season, will cause a time of calmness
   and clearness to return to them. If the latter exposition is adopted,
   then, by darkness, or by the cloudy, and rainy, or stormy season, the
   prophet means the afflictions to which God subjects his servants for
   the trial of their patience. The former interpretation appears to be
   more appropriate, That, when the whole world is overwhelmed with
   troubles, God's grace shines upon the faithful, who feel comfortable
   and happy, because he is propitious towards them. It is thus that their
   condition is properly distinguished from that which forms the common
   lot of other men. For the ungodly, however they may exult in
   prosperity, are, nevertheless, blind in the midst of light, because
   they are strangers to God's paternal kindness; and, in adversity, they
   are plunged into the darkness of death; and, consequently, they never
   enjoy a season of calm repose. On the contrary, the godly, upon whom
   the favor of God constantly shines, though liable to the ills incident
   to humanity, are never overwhelmed with darkness, and hence the
   propriety of what is here stated, light ariseth to them in darkness If
   we give to the Hebrew verb an active signification, then, in one
   respect, the construction of the words will be preferable. For I have
   no doubt that the prophet intends, as applicable to God, the epithets,
   gracious, merciful, and just Therefore, if we read it as a neuter verb,
   light ariseth, then the latter clause of the verse will be the reason
   for the statement made in the former clause. As to the exposition, that
   the righteous and humane do not diffuse darkness over the world, as the
   unrighteous and wicked do; that they do not extract smoke from light,
   but light from smoke; it must be viewed as nothing else than a
   perversion of the prophet's language.

   5 A good man This is the commonly received interpretation of the
   passage. I am disposed, however, to prefer another, That it shall be
   well with those who are gracious and communicative; because this is
   more in accordance with the purport of the prophet's language. It is
   his intention to show how greatly the ungodly are deceived, when they
   aspire after happiness by nefarious and unlawful practices; seeing that
   the favor of God is the source and cause of all good things. Hence it
   becomes necessary to supply the relative who. He proceeds, therefore,
   to put us on our guard as to the deception which those practice upon
   themselves, who hasten to enrich themselves by sordid parsimony and
   oppressive extortion; inasmuch as the faithful, by their clemency and
   kindness, open up a channel, through which the favor of God flows to
   them: for the term tvv, tob, though in the masculine gender, signifying
   good, is often taken as if it were neuter, to denote that which is
   good. He puts lending as if it were the fruit of mercy; for the usurer
   also lends, but it is that, under the false pretense of assisting the
   distressed, he may plunder them. It is, then, the truly liberal, who,
   from compassion, and not with the design of ensnaring the poor, grant
   relief to them, that God makes prosperous. The term dvym, debarim, in
   the end of the verse, signifies words; but, along with David Kimchi,
   the most correct expositor among the Rabbins, I take it to mean
   affairs. Words is a very tame translation, [347] not to say, that, if
   this had been the prophet's intention, he would have expressed himself
   in more simple terms. The translation which I have given is the proper
   one, that the righteous will manage their affairs with prudence and
   discernment; so that, in their domestic affairs, they will neither be
   too lavish nor sordidly parsimonious; but, in every thing, they will
   study to combine frugality with economy, without giving way to luxury.
   And, in all their mercantile transactions; they will always be guided
   by the principles of equity and morality.

   6 Surely he shall not be moved. The Hebrew particle ky, ki, may here be
   taken in its natural or causal meaning, and thus be rendered for,
   especially if in the preceding verse we adopt the marginal reading, It
   shall be well with the man. For he refers in more explicit terms to
   that happiness of which he spake, that God sustains the compassionate
   and humane, so that amid all the vicissitudes of life they remain
   unmoved; that he makes their innocence appear, and protects them from
   unjust calumny. It is said they are never moved They are indeed liable
   to the incidents common to humanity, and even may often appear as if
   they were about to sink under the weight of their calamities; but their
   confidence remains unshaken, and by invincible patience they surmount
   all their adversities. With God as the defender of their righteousness,
   they yet do not escape from being assailed by the slanders of the
   ungodly, but it is enough for them that their name is blessed before
   God, the angels, and the whole assembly of the godly.

   7. He shall not be afraid when he hears evil tidings This may appear to
   be a confirmation of the statement contained in the preceding verse,
   being as much as to say, That the righteous are exempted from the
   infamous name which the reprobate secure to themselves by their vicious
   conduct. I rather take the meaning to be, that the righteous, unlike
   unbelievers, who tremble at every even the slightest rumor, calmly and
   peacefully confide in God's paternal care, amid all the evil tidings
   which may reach them. Whence is it that unbelievers are in constant
   agitation, but that they imagine they are the sport of fortune on the
   earth, while God remains at ease in heaven? No wonder, then, that the
   rustling of the falling leaf troubles and alarms them. From such
   uneasiness the faithful are freed, because they neither give heed to
   rumors, nor does the fear of them prevent them from constantly invoking
   God. The children of God may also manifest symptoms of fear at the
   prospect of impending danger; for were they altogether regardless of
   calamities, such indifference would be the result, not of confidence in
   God, but of insensibility. But should they not be able to lay aside all
   fear and anxiety, yet, acknowledging God as the guardian of their life,
   and pursuing the tenor of their way, they intrust themselves to his
   preserving care, and cheerfully resign themselves to his disposal. This
   is that magnanimity of the righteous, under the influence of which the
   prophet declares they can disregard those rumors of evil which strike
   others with alarm. Wisely, too, do they rely upon God for support;
   because, encompassed on all sides with deaths innumerable, we would
   sink into despair were we not borne up by the confidence that we are
   secure under God's protection. Genuine stability, then, is that which
   the prophet here describes, and which consists in reposing with
   unshaken confidence in God. On the other hand, that presumptuous
   confidence with which the ungodly are intoxicated exposes them the
   more, to the indignation of God, inasmuch as they overlook the frailty
   of human life, and in their pride of heart madly set themselves in
   opposition to him. Therefore, when "they shall say, Peace and safety,
   then shall sudden destruction come upon them," (1 Thessalonians 5:3.)
   But a sense of calamities, while it alarms and disconcerts the
   faithful, does not make them faint-hearted, because it does not shake
   their faith, by which they are rendered bold and steadfast. In a word,
   they are not insensible to their trials, [348] but the confidence which
   they place in God enables them to rise above all the cares of the
   present life. Thus they preserve calmness and composedness of mind, and
   wait patiently till the fit season arrives for taking vengeance upon
   the reprobate.

   [343] "Ou, il a fait reluire la lumiere." -- Fr. marg. "Or, he hath
   made light to arise or to shine." There is here perhaps, as Horsley
   supposes, an allusion to what happened in Egypt, when the Israelites
   had light in all their dwellings, while the land was wrapt in darkness.
   "The first hemistich," says Phillips, "is figurative. Trouble is
   represented by chsk, darkness; and health or prosperity by 'vr, light.
   A pious man shall be found to enjoy prosperity, even when troubles come
   upon the rest of the world; in such a period of general darkness there
   shall spring up a light to the upright; viz., Jehovah himself, who is
   gracious, and merciful, and just. The first two epithets of the second
   member are found, in Psalm 111:4, applied to God."

   [344] "Ou, bien sera a l'homme qui." -- Fr. marg. "Or, it shall be well
   with the man who." With this corresponds the translation of Archbishop
   Secker, which is, "Happy is the man who," etc. In proof that tvv
   signifies happy, he refers to Isaiah 3:10; Jeremiah 44:17; Lamentations
   4:9

   [346] "His desire is a supplement made in the French version, but not
   in the Latin; and, if it is admitted, we must be careful not to
   understand it as implying any thing like revenge. The good man has
   enemies of various kinds. Worldly and wicked men are often his enemies.
   But he does not desire their destruction; for this would be utterly
   inconsistent with the Christian spirit. According to Hammond, the
   supplement is unnecessary. His reading is, "He shall behold or look
   upon his oppressors or distressers;" which he explains thus, "He shall
   behold them securely, confidently look in their faces, as we say, as
   being now no longer under their power, being freed from their tyranny
   and pressures." In Psalm 54:7, we meet with a similar expression, which
   see explained, in reference to David's circumstances at that time, in
   volume 2, page 324, note. It is used again in Psalm 59:11, "God shall
   let me see or look on mine enemies;" in Psalm 92:11, "Mine eye hath
   looked on mine enemies, and mine ear hath heard of them that rise up
   against me," that is, hath seen and heard of their destruction; and in
   Psalm 118:7, "I shall look upon my haters," that is, having God for my
   helper, I shall without fear look upon them.

   [347] It is so translated in some of the ancient versions, and by
   several critics. In the Syriac it is, "will support his words in
   judgment;" i.e., will never utter any thing but what is strictly true.
   In like manner, Cocceius. In the Arabic, which is followed by Castalio,
   it is, "will moderate his words in judgment;" i.e., will speak as
   favourably of delinquents as he can consistently with truth, contrary
   to the practice of the wicked. -- Psalm 94:21.

   Psalm 112:9-10

   9. He has distributed, he has given to the poor; his righteousness
   endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honor. 10. The wicked
   shall see it, and be angry; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt
   away: [349] The desire of the wicked shall perish.


   9 He has distributed, he hath given to the poor Once more he affirms
   that the righteous never lose the fruit and the reward of their
   liberality. And first, by dispersing, the prophet intimates, that they
   did not give sparingly and grudgingly, as some do who imagine that they
   discharge their duty to the poor when they dole out a small pittance to
   them, but that they give liberally as necessity requires and their
   means allow; for it may happen that a liberal heart does not possess a
   large portion of the wealth of this world. All that the prophet means
   is, that they are never so parsimonious as not to be always ready to
   distribute according to their means. Next he adds, they give to the
   poor, meaning that they do not bestow their charity at random, but with
   prudence and discretion meet the wants of the necessitous. We are aware
   that unnecessary and superfluous expenditure for the sake of
   ostentation is frequently lauded by the world; and, consequently, a
   larger quantity of the good things of this life is squandered away in
   luxury and ambition than is dispensed in charity prudently bestowed.
   The prophet instructs us that the praise which belongs to liberality
   does not consist in distributing our goods without any regard to the
   objects upon whom they are conferred, and the purposes to which they
   are applied, but in relieving the wants of the really necessitous, and
   in the money being expended on things proper and lawful. This passage
   is quoted by Paul, (2 Corinthians 9:9) in which he informs us that it
   is an easy matter for God to bless us with plenty, so that we may
   exercise our bounty freely, deliberately, and impartially, and this
   accords best with the design of the prophet. The next clause, his
   righteousness endureth for ever, is susceptible of two interpretations.
   That immoderate ambition which impels the ungodly to squander away
   their goods merits not the name of virtue. It may, therefore, with
   propriety be said, that it is a uniform course of liberality which is
   here praised by the prophet, according to what he formerly observed,
   that the righteous manage their affairs with discretion. If any prefer
   to refer it to the fruit of righteousness, I have no objection. And,
   indeed, it appears to be a repetition of the same sentence which lately
   came under our notice. Then the prophet shows how God by his benefits
   preserves the glory of that righteousness which is due to their
   liberality, and does not disappoint them of their reward, in that he
   exalteth their horn more and more, that is, their power or their
   prosperous condition.

   10. The wicked shall see it. [350] Here follows a contrast similar to
   that which we met with in Psalm 2:5, which renders the grace of God
   towards the faithful the more illustrious. His meaning is, that though
   the wicked may cast off all regard to piety, and banish from their
   minds all thoughts of human affairs being under the superintending
   providence of God, they shall yet be made to feel, whether they will or
   no, that the righteous, in compliance with God's command, do not vainly
   devote themselves to the cultivation of charity and mercy. Let them
   harden themselves as they choose, yet he declares that the honor, which
   God confers upon his children, shall be exhibited to them, the sight of
   which shall make them gnash with their teeth, and shall excite an envy
   that shall consume them by inches. [351] In conclusion, he adds, that
   the wicked shall be disappointed of their desires They are never
   content, but are continually thirsting after something, and their
   confidence is as presumptuous as their avarice is unbounded. And hence,
   in their foolish expectations, they do not hesitate at grasping at the
   whole world. But the prophet tells them that God will snatch from them
   what they imagined was already in their possession, so that they shall
   always depart destitute and famishing.

   PSALM 113

   In this psalm the providence of God furnishes matter for praising him,
   because, though his excellency is far above the heavens, nevertheless,
   he deigns to cast his eyes upon the earth to take notice of mankind.
   And as not a few are disconcerted by the vicissitudes which they behold
   occurring in the world, the prophet takes occasion, from these sudden
   and unlooked for changes, to warn us to attend expressly to God's
   providence, that we may entertain no doubt that all things are governed
   according to his will and pleasure. [352]

   Psalm 113:1-4

   1. Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, ye servants of Jehovah! praise the name
   of Jehovah. 2. Blessed be the name of Jehovah henceforth and for ever.
   3. Jehovah's name is to be praised, from the rising of the sun unto his
   going down. 4. Jehovah is high above all nations, his glory is above
   the heavens.


   1 Praise, ye servants of Jehovah! This psalm contains abundant reasons
   for all men without exception to praise God. The faithful alone being
   endued with spiritual perception to recognize the hand of God, the
   prophet addresses them in particular. And if we consider how cold and
   callous men are in this religious exercise, we will not deem the
   repetition of the call to praise God superfluous. We all acknowledge
   that we are created to praise God's name, while, at the same time, his
   glory is disregarded by us. Such criminal apathy is justly condemned by
   the prophet, with the view of stirring us up to unwearied zeal in
   praising God. The repetition, then, of the exhortation to praise him,
   ought to be considered as referring both to perseverance and ardor in
   this service. If, by the servants of God, some would rather understand
   the Levites, to whom the charge of celebrating his praises under the
   Law was committed, I am not much opposed to it, provided they do not
   exclude the rest of the faithful, over whom formerly God appointed the
   Levites as leaders and chief musicians, that he might be praised by all
   his people without exception. When the Holy Spirit addresses the
   Levites expressly in relation to the subject of God's praises, it is
   designedly that, by their example, they may show the way to others, and
   that the whole Church may respond in one holy chorus. Now that we are
   all "a royal priesthood," (1 Peter 2:9) and as Zechariah testifies,
   (Zechariah 14:21) that under the reign of Christ, the meanest of the
   people shall be Levites, there is no question that, excepting
   unbelievers who are mute, the prophet invites us all in common to
   render this service unto God.

   2 Blessed be the name of Jehovah The prophet confirms what I stated
   above, that the praises of God must be continued throughout the whole
   course of our life. If his name is to be continually praised, it ought,
   at least, to be our earnest endeavor, during our brief pilgrimage here,
   that the remembrance of it may flourish after we are dead. In the next
   verse, he extends the glory of God's name to all parts of the earth;
   wherefore our apathy will be totally inexcusable, if we do not make its
   praises resound among ourselves. Under the law, God could not be
   praised aright, excepting in Judea by his own people, to whom the
   knowledge of him was confined. His works, however, which are visible to
   all nations, are worthy of the admiration of the whole world. To the
   same effect is the following clause respecting the loftiness of God's
   glory; for can there be any thing more base, than for us to magnify it
   but seldom and tardily, considering it ought to fill our thoughts with
   enrapturing admiration? In extolling the name of God so highly, the
   prophet intends to show us that there is no ground for indifference;
   that silence would savor of impiety were we not to exert ourselves to
   the utmost of our ability to celebrate his praises, in order that our
   affections may, as it were, rise above the heavens. When he adds, that
   God is high above all nations, there is an implied reproach, by which
   he fastens upon the chosen people the charge of apathy in the exercise
   of praise. For can there be any thing more preposterous, than for those
   who are eye-witnesses of God's glory, which shines forth even among the
   blind, to refrain from making it the theme of their praises? At the
   very time when God conferred upon the Jews the exclusive honor of being
   the depositaries of the knowledge of his heavenly doctrine, he was
   nevertheless, according to Paul, not without a witness, (Acts 14:17;
   Romans 1:20) After the promulgation of the Gospel, his exaltation above
   the nations was more evident, for then the whole world was placed under
   his sway.

   Psalm 113:5-9

   5. Who is like unto Jehovah our God, who hath his dwelling on high, 6.
   Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are done in heaven, and
   on earth! [353] 7. Who raises the poor from the dust, who lifts the
   afflicted from the dunghill; 8. That he may place him with princes,
   with the princes of his people. 9. Who maketh the barren woman to dwell
   in the family, a joyful mother of children. Praise ye Jehovah. [354]


   5 Who is like unto Jehovah our God The prophet strengthens his position
   for the celebration of God's praises, by contrasting the height of his
   glory and power with his unbounded goodness. Not that his goodness can
   be separated from his glory; but this distinction is made out of regard
   to men, who would not be able to endure his majesty, were he not kindly
   to humble himself, and gently and kindly draw us towards him. The
   amount is, that God's dwelling above the heavens, at such a distance
   from us, does not prevent him from showing himself to be near at hand,
   and plainly providing for our welfare; and, in saying that God is
   exalted above the heavens, he magnifies his mercy towards men, whose
   condition is mean and despicable, and informs us that he might
   righteously hold even angels in contempt, were it not that, moved by
   paternal regard, he condescends to take them under his care. If in
   regard to angels he humble himself, what is to be said in regard to
   men, who, grovelling upon the earth, are altogether filthy? Is it
   asked, whether or not God fills heaven and earth? The answer is
   obvious. The words of the prophet simply mean, that God may trample the
   noblest of his creatures under his feet, or rather that, by reason of
   their infinite distance, he may entirely disregard them. In short, we
   must conclude that it is not from our proximity to him, but from his
   own free choice, that he condescends to make us the objects of his
   peculiar care.

   7 Who raiseth the poor from the dust In this passage, he speaks in
   terms of commendation of God's providential care in relation to those
   diversified changes which men are disposed to regard as accidental. He
   declares that it is solely by the appointment of God that things
   undergo changes far surpassing our anticipations. If the course of
   events were always uniform, men would ascribe it merely to natural
   causes, whereas, the vicissitudes which take place teach us that all
   things are regulated in accordance with the secret counsel of God. On
   the other hand, struck with astonishment at the events which have
   happened contrary to our expectation, we instantly ascribe them to
   chance. And as we are so apt to view things from a point the very
   reverse from that of recognising God's superintending care, the prophet
   enjoins us to admire his providence in matters of marvellous, or of
   unusual occurrence; for since cowherds, and men of the lowest and most
   abject condition, have been elevated to the summit of power, it is most
   reasonable that our attention should be arrested by a change so
   unexpected. We now perceive the prophet's design. In this passage, as
   well as in others, he might have set before us the structure of the
   heavens and the earth; but, as our minds are unaffected by the ordinary
   course of things, he declares that the hand of God is most apparent in
   his marvellous works. And in saying that men of mean and abject
   condition are not merely elevated to some petty sovereignty, but that
   they are invested with power and authority over God's holy people, he
   increases the greatness of the miracle -- that being of far more
   consequence than to rule in other parts of the earth; for the state or
   kingdom of the Church constitutes the principal and august theater
   where God presents and displays the tokens of his wonderful power,
   wisdom, and righteousness.

   9 Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in the family He relates another
   work of God, which if, apparently, not so notable, ought not, on that
   account, the less to engage our thoughts. Unimpressed as we are by the
   ordinary works of God, we are constrained to express our astonishment
   when a woman who has been for a long period barren, unexpectedly
   becomes the mother of a numerous family. The Hebrew term, hvyt,
   habbayith, is to be understood, not simply of a house, but also of a
   household, -- that is, the thing containing, for that which is
   contained, -- just as the Greeks apply oikos, and the Latins domus, to
   a household. The meaning is, that the woman who was formerly barren is
   blessed with fruitfulness, and fills the house with children. He
   attributes joy to mothers, because, though the hearts of all are prone
   to aspire after wealth, or honor, or pleasures, or any other
   advantages, yet is progeny preferred to every thing else. Wherefore,
   since God superintends the ordinary course of nature, alters the
   current of events, elevates those of abject condition and ignoble
   extraction, and makes the barren woman fruitful, our insensibility is
   very culpable, if we do not attentively contemplate the works of his
   hand.

   [352] This interesting little ode, which is alike elegant in its
   structure, and devotional in its sentiment, its theme being the
   celebration of Jehovah's power, glory, and mercy, is thought by Bishop
   Patrick to be the commencement of what the Hebrews called the Great
   Hallel or Hymns, which they recited at their tables in the new moons
   and other feasts, especially in the paschal night, after they had eaten
   the lamb. He supposes that the Great Hallel included this and the five
   following psalms. See [20]page 310. "It is very uncertain who was the
   author of this psalm; but as the 7th and 8th verses are manifestly
   taken from 1 Samuel 2:8, and the 9th probably alludes to the history of
   Hannah, it might be composed by Samuel or David, who were so nearly
   interested in the signal mercies vouchsafed to her." -- Dimock.

   PSALM 114

   This psalm contains a short account of that deliverance by which God,
   in bringing his people out of Egypt: and conducting them to the
   promised inheritance, gave a proof of his power and grace which ought
   to be held in everlasting remembrance. The design of that wonderful
   deliverance was, that the seed of Abraham might yield themselves wholly
   to God, who, receiving them by a gracious act of adoption, purposed
   that they should be to him a holy and peculiar people. [355]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 114:1-4

   1. When Israel went out from Egypt, and the house of Jacob from a
   barbarous people; [356] 2. Judah was for his [357] holiness, Israel for
   his dominions. 3. The sea saw, and fled: [358] Jordan was turned
   backward. 4. The mountains leaped like rams, and the hills as the lambs
   of the flock.


   1 When Israel went out from Egypt That exodus being a remarkable pledge
   and symbol of God's love for the children of Abraham, it is not
   surprising that it should be so frequently called to remembrance. In
   the beginning of the psalm, the prophet informs us that the people whom
   God purchased at so great a price are no more their own. The opinion of
   certain expositors, that at that time the tribe of Judah was
   consecrated to the service of God, according to what is said in Exodus
   19:6, and 1 Peter 2:9, appears to me foreign to the prophet's design.
   All doubt about the matter is removed by what is immediately subjoined,
   God's taking Israel under his rule, which is simply a repetition of the
   same sentiment in other words. Judah being the most powerful and
   numerous of all the tribes, and occupying the chief place among them,
   here takes the precedency of the rest of the people. At the same time,
   it is very evident that the honor which is in a peculiar manner
   ascribed to them, belongs equally to the whole body of the people.
   [359] When God is said to be sanctified, it must be understood that the
   prophet is speaking after the manner of men, because, in himself, God
   is incapable of increase or diminution. Judah is called his holiness,
   [360] and Israel his dominion, [361] because his holy majesty, which
   hitherto had been little known, secured the veneration of all who had
   witnessed the displays of his incredible power. In delivering his
   people, God erected a kingdom for himself and procured respect for his
   sacred name; if then they do not constantly reflect upon such a
   remarkable instance of his kindness, their insensibility is totally
   inexcusable.

   3 The sea saw, and fled He does not enumerate in succession all the
   miracles which were wrought at that time, but briefly alludes to the
   sea, which, though a lifeless and senseless element, is yet struck with
   terror at the power of God. Jordan did the same, and the very mountains
   shook. It is in a poetical strain that the Psalmist describes the
   receding of the sea and of the Jordan. The description, however, does
   not exceed the facts of the case. The sea, in rendering such obedience
   to its Creator, sanctified his name; and Jordan, by its submission, put
   honor upon his power; and the mountains, by their quaking, proclaimed
   how they were overawed at the presence of his dreadful majesty. By
   these examples it is not meant to celebrate God's power more than the
   fatherly care and desire which he manifests for the preservation of the
   Church; and, accordingly, Israel is very properly distinguished from
   the sea, the Jordan, and the mountains -- there being a very marked
   difference between the chosen people and the insensate elements.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [356] The word lz, loez, which Calvin renders, a barbarous people, is
   translated, in our English Bible, "a people of strange language." His
   version is supported by many authorities. The word is frequently found,
   in the sense he attaches to it, in Rabbinical works, and is so
   understood here by the Chaldee paraphrast, who has vrvr'y, and by the
   LXX., who have barbarou. The root of these terms, as well as the Latin
   word for barbarous, is probably the Hebrew vr, out, or without,
   redoubled; and so it signifies, to a Jew, any man of another nation.
   According to Parkhurst, the word, instead of signifying a barbarous or
   foreign language or pronunciation, seems rather to refer to the
   violence of the Egyptians towards the Israelites, or the barbarity of
   their behavior, which, he observes, was more to the Psalmist's purpose
   than the barbarity of their language, even supposing the reality of the
   latter in the time of Moses. -- See his Lexicon on lz. Horsley reads,
   "a tyrannical people."

   [357] "There is a peculiar beauty in the conduct of this psalm, in that
   the author utterly conceals the presence of God in the beginning of it,
   and rather lets a possessive pronoun (i.e. His) go without a
   substantive, than he will so much as mention any thing of Divinity
   there; because, if God had appeared before, there could be no wonder
   why the mountains should leap, and the sea retire; therefore, that this
   convulsion of nature may be brought in with due surprise, his name is
   not mentioned till afterwards, and then, with a very agreeable turn of
   thought, God is introduced at once with all majesty " -- Spectator,
   volume 6, No. 461. If, however, the last two words of the preceding
   psalm, hllv-yh, Halelu-yah, Praise ye Jehovah, are the title to this
   psalm, the antecedent to his is supplied.

   [358] In the Hebrew there is no pronoun after saw; nor is any inserted
   in the Septuagint and Arabic versions, or in the Chaldee. In our
   English Bible, it is inserted, and him in the Syriac version; but the
   sentence is certainly much more sublime without any such supplement.

   [359] "Judah represents here the whole people of Israel, as Joseph
   does, in Psalm 81:6. The reason assigned by Kimchi for this use of
   yhvdh here is, that at the time of the departure from Egypt, Judah was
   considered the head or chief of the tribes; see Genesis 49:8-10. This,
   however, is mere conjecture. If it be necessary to assign reasons for
   the distinction here conferred on this tribe, I should mention as one:,
   that the ark was kept in the region occupied by the descendants of
   Judah, and, as another, that from him the Messiah was to spring." --
   Phillips.

   [360] God's holiness being often taken for the keeping his promise
   sacred or inviolate, as in Psalm 102:9, when, reference being made to
   the immutability of his covenant, it is added, "holy [as in another
   respect, reverend] is his name;" some, as Hammond and Cresswell,
   suppose that the meaning here is, that God's dealings towards Judah --
   the people of the Jews, were a demonstration of his faithfulness in
   performing his promise made to Abraham long before.

   [361] Hammond reads, "And Israel his power," by which he understands
   that Israel was an instance of his power; that God, in his acting for
   Israel, declared his omnipotence most signally.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 114:5-8

   5. What ailed thee, O see! that thou fleddest? and thou, Jordan, that
   thou turnedst back? 6. The mountains, that ye did leap like rams; and
   ye hills, like lambs of the flock? 7. At the presence of the Lord,
   tremble, thou earth, [362] at the presence of the God of Jacob; 8. Who
   turned the rock into pools of water, [363] and the mighty rock into a
   fountain of waters. [364]


   5 What ailed thee, O sea! The prophet interrogates the sea, Jordan, and
   the mountains, in a familiar and poetical strain, as lately he ascribed
   to them a sense and reverence for God's power. And, by these
   similitudes, he very sharply reproves the insensibility of those
   persons, who do not employ the intelligence which God has given them in
   the contemplation of his works. The appearance which he tells us the
   sea assumed, is more than sufficient to condemn their blindness. It
   could not be dried up, the river Jordan could not roll back its waters,
   had not God, by his invisible agency, constrained them to render
   obedience to his command. The words are indeed directed to the sea, the
   Jordan, and the mountains, but they are more immediately addressed to
   us, that every one of us, on self-reflection, may carefully and
   attentively weigh this matter. And, therefore, as often as we meet with
   these words, let each of us reiterate the sentiment, -- "Such a change
   cannot be attributed to nature, and to subordinate causes, but the hand
   of God is manifest here." The figure drawn from the lambs and rams
   would appear to be inferior to the magnitude of the subject. But it was
   the prophet's intention to express in the homeliest way the incredible
   manner in which God, on these occasions, displayed his power. The
   stability of the earth being, as it were, founded on the mountains,
   what connection can they have with rams and lambs, that they should be
   agitated, skipping hither and thither? In speaking in this homely
   style, he does not mean to detract from the greatness of the miracle,
   but more forcibly to engrave these extraordinary tokens of God's power
   on the illiterate.

   7 At the presence of the Lord Having aroused the senses of men by
   interrogations, he now furnishes a reply, which many understand to be a
   personification of the earth; because they take y, yod, to be the affix
   of the verb chvly, chuli; and they represent the earth as saying, It is
   my duty to tremble at the presence of the Lord. This fanciful
   interpretation is untenable; for the term, earth, is immediately
   subjoined. Others, with more propriety, considering the y, yod, in
   this, as in many other passages, to be redundant, adopt this
   interpretation: It is reasonable and becoming that the earth should
   tremble in the presence of the Lord. Again, the term chvly, chuli, is
   by many rendered in the imperative mood; which interpretation I readily
   adopt, as it is most probable that the prophet again makes an appeal to
   the earth, that the hearts of men may be the more sensibly moved. The
   meaning is the same, -- It must be that the earth quake at the presence
   of her King. And this view receives confirmation from the term 'dvn,
   adon, being used, which signifies a lord or a master. He then
   immediately introduces the name of the God of Jacob, for the purpose of
   banishing from men all notions of false gods. Their minds being prone
   to deceit, they are always in great danger of allowing idols to usurp
   the place of the true God. Another miracle is mentioned, in which God,
   after the passage of the people through the Red Sea, gave an additional
   splendid manifestation of his power in the wilderness. The glory of
   God, as he informs us, did not appear for one day only, on the
   departure of the people; it constantly shone in his other works, as
   when a stream suddenly issued out of the dry rock, Exodus 17:6. Waters
   may be found trickling out from among rocks and stony places, but to
   make them flow out of a dry rock, was unquestionably above the ordinary
   course of nature, or miraculous. I have no intention of entering into
   any ingenious discussion, how the stone was converted into water; all
   that the prophet means amounts simply to this, that water flowed in
   places formerly dry and hard. How absurd, then, is it for the sophists
   to pretend that a transubstantiation takes place in every case in which
   the Scripture affirms that a change has been produced? The substance of
   the stone was not converted into water, but God miraculously created
   the water, which gushed out of the dry rock.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [362] Street reads, "The earth was in pain." "All the ancient
   versions," says he, "have the preterperfect here. The Targum alone
   agrees with the present reading, if, indeed, that be an imperative
   mood. For I do not see why chvly may not be a participle passive with
   an yod added to it, as hhphky may be a participle active with the same
   addition."

   [363] Hammond reads, "into a lake of water." "The mym 'gm," he
   observes, "is best rendered a lake of water, to note the abundance of
   it; accordingly, the Chaldee renders it l'ryth, into a river: and so
   the Psalmist expressly describes the gushing out of the waters from the
   rock,' that they ran in dry places like a river,' Psalm 105:41."

   [364] "The divine poet represents the very substance of the rock as
   being converted into water, not literally, but poetically -- that is
   ornamenting his sketch of the wondrous power displayed on this
   occasion." -- Walford.

   [355] "The exodus of Israel from Egypt, with some of its most
   remarkable accompanying and consequent miracles, are, in this brief

   sublimity, in thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.'" -- Drake's
   Harp of Judah.

   PSALM 115

   It is obvious that this psalm was penned when the Church was deeply
   afflicted. Unworthy as they are to be heard by God, the faithful,
   nevertheless, offer up supplications to him for deliverance, lest his
   holy name might be exposed to scorn and reproach among the heathen.
   Then, mustering courage, they mock at the madness of all who are
   addicted to the worship of idols; and, with holy boasting, they magnify
   their own happiness, in that they have been adopted by God; and from
   this also they take occasion to stimulate one another to acknowledge
   the kindness which they have received from him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 115:1-3

   1. Not unto us, O Jehovah! not unto us, but unto thy name give the
   glory, on account of thy mercy, on account of thy truth. 2. Why should
   the heathen say, Where is now their God? 3. Surely our God is in
   heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.


   1 Not unto us, O Jehovah! It is not certain by whom, or at what time,
   this psalm was composed. [365] We learn from the first part of it, that
   the faithful betake themselves to God, in circumstances of extreme
   distress. They do not make known their desires in plain words, but
   indirectly hint at the nature of their request. They openly disclaim
   all merit, and all hope of obtaining deliverance otherwise than God's
   doing it from a sole regard to his own glory, for these things are
   inseparably connected. Deserving, therefore, to meet with a repulse,
   they yet beseech God not to expose his name to the derision of the
   heathen. In their distress they desire to obtain consolation and
   support; but, finding nothing in themselves meritorious of God's favor,
   they call upon him to grant their requests, that his glory may be
   maintained. This is a point to which we ought carefully to attend,
   that, altogether unworthy as we are of God's regard, we may cherish the
   hope of being saved by him, from the respect that he has for the glory
   of his name, and from his having adopted us on condition of never
   forsaking us. It must, also be noticed, that their humility and modesty
   prevent them from openly complaining of their distresses, and that they
   do not begin with a request for their own deliverance, but for the
   glory of God. Suffused with shame by reason of their calamity, which,
   in itself, amounts to a kind of rejection, they durst not openly crave,
   at God's hand, what they wished, but made their appeal indirectly,
   that, from a regard to his own glory, he would prove a father to
   sinners, who had no claim upon him whatever. And, as this formulary of
   prayer has once been delivered to the Church, let us also, in all our
   approaches unto God, remember to lay aside all self-righteousness, and
   to place our hopes entirely on his free favor. Moreover, when we pray
   for help, we ought to have the glory of God in view, in the deliverance
   which we obtain. And it is most likely they adopted this form of
   prayer, being led to do so by the promise. For, during the captivity,
   God had said, "Not for your sake, but for mine own sake will I do
   this," Isaiah 48:11. When all other hopes fail, they acknowledge this
   to be their only refuge. The repetition of it is an evidence how
   conscious they were of their own demerit, so that, if their prayers
   should happen to be rejected a hundred times, they could not, in their
   own name, prefer any charge against him.

   2 Why should the heathen say, Where is now their God? They here express
   how God would maintain his glory in the preservation of the Church,
   which, if he permitted to be destroyed, would expose his name to the
   impious reproaches of the heathen, who would blaspheme the God of
   Israel, as being destitute of power, because he forsook his servants in
   the time of need. This is not done from the persuasion that God
   requires any such representation, but rather that the faithful may
   direct their thoughts back to that holy zeal contained in the words to
   which we have formerly adverted, "The railings of those that railed
   against thee have fallen upon me," Psalm 69:10. And this is the reason
   for not having recourse to rhetorical embellishment, to move him to put
   forth his power to preserve the Church; they simply protest that their
   anxiety for their own safety does not prevent them from valuing the
   glory of God, even as it is worthy of being more highly valued. They go
   on to show how the glory of God was connected with their deliverance,
   by declaring that he was the Author of the covenant, which the ungodly
   had boasted was abolished and disannulled; and who, consequently, had
   declared that the grace of God was frustrated, and that his promises
   were vain. This is the ground on which they remind him of his favor and
   faithfulness, both of which were liable to mischievous calumnies,
   should he disappoint the hopes of his people, to whom he was bound by
   an everlasting covenant; and upon whom, in the exercise of his
   gratuitous mercy, he had bestowed the privilege of adoption. And as
   God, in making us also partakers of his Gospel, has condescended to
   graft us into the body of his Son, we ought to make a public
   acknowledgement of the same.

   3 Surely our God is in heaven. [366] The faithful, with holy boldness,
   encourage themselves the more to prayer. Our prayers, we know, are
   worthless when we are agitated with doubts. Had that blasphemy
   penetrated their hearts, it would have inflicted a mortal wound. And
   hence they very opportunely guard against it, by discontinuing the
   train of their supplications. By-and-bye we shall consider the second
   clause of this verse in its proper place, where they scoff at the
   idols, and lewd superstitions of the heathen. But, at present, every
   word in this clause demands our careful inspection. When they place God
   in heaven, they do not confine him to a certain locality, nor set
   limits to his infinite essence; but they deny the limitation of his
   power, its being shut up to human instrumentality only, or its being
   subject to fate or fortune. In short, they put the universe under his
   control; and, being superior to every obstruction, he does freely every
   thing that may seem good to him. This truth is still more plainly
   asserted in the subsequent clause, He hath done whatsoever pleased him.
   God, then, may be said to dwell in heaven, as the world is subject to
   his will, and nothing can prevent him from accomplishing his purpose.

   That God can do whatsoever he pleaseth is a doctrine of great
   importance, provided it be truly and legitimately applied. This caution
   is necessary, because curious and forward persons, as is usual with
   them, take the liberty of abusing a sound doctrine by producing it in
   defense of their frantic reveries. And in this matter we daily witness
   too much of the wildness of human ingenuity. This mystery, which ought
   to command our admiration and awe, is by many shamelessly and
   irreverently made a topic of idle talk. If we would derive advantage
   from this doctrine, we must attend to the import of God's doing
   whatsoever he pleaseth in heaven and on the earth. And, first, God has
   all power for the preservation of his Church, and for providing for her
   welfare; and, secondly, all creatures are under his control, and
   therefore nothing can prevent him from accomplishing all his purposes.
   However much, then, the faithful may find themselves cut off from all
   means of subsistence and safety, they ought nevertheless to take
   courage from the fact, that God is not only superior to all
   impediments, but that he can render them subservient to the advancement
   of his own designs. This, too, must also be borne in mind, that all
   events are the result of God's appointment alone, and that nothing
   happens by chance. This much it was proper to premise respecting the
   use of this doctrine, that we may be prevented from forming unworthy
   conceptions of the glory of God, as men of wild imaginations are wont
   to do. Adopting this principle, we ought not to be ashamed frankly to
   acknowledge that God, by his eternal counsel, manages all things in
   such a manner, that nothing can be done but by his will and
   appointment.

   From this passage Augustine very properly and ingeniously shows, that
   those events which appear to us unreasonable not only occur simply by
   the permission of God, but also by his will and decree. For if our God
   doeth whatsoever pleaseth him, why should he permit that to be done
   which he does not wish? Why does he not restrain the devil and all the
   wicked who set themselves in opposition to him? If he be regarded as
   occupying an intermediate position between doing and suffering, so as
   to tolerate what he does not wish, then, according to the fancy of the
   Epicureans, he will remain unconcerned in the heavens. But if we admit
   that God is invested with prescience, that he superintends and governs
   the world which he has made, and that he does not overlook any part of
   it, it must follow that every thing which takes place is done according
   to his will. Those who speak as if this would be to render God the
   author of evil are perverse disputants. Filthy dogs though they be, yet
   they will not, by their barking, be able to substantiate a charge of
   lying against the prophet, or to take the government of the world out
   of God's hand. If nothing occurs unless by the counsel and
   determination of God, he apparently does not disallow sin; he has,
   however, secret and to us unknown causes why he permits that which
   perverse men do, and yet this is not done because he approves of their
   wicked inclinations. It was the will of God that Jerusalem should be
   destroyed, the Chaldeans also wished the same thing, but after a
   different manner; and though he frequently calls the Babylonians his
   stipendiary soldiers, and says that they were stirred up by him,
   (Isaiah 5:26;) and farther, that they were the sword of his own hand,
   yet we would not therefore call them his allies, inasmuch as their
   object was very different. In the destruction of Jerusalem God's
   justice would be displayed, while the Chaldeans would be justly
   censured for their lust, covetousness, and cruelty. Hence, whatever
   takes place in the world is according to the will of God, and yet it is
   not his will that any evil should be done. For however incomprehensible
   his counsel may be to us, still it is always based upon the best of
   reasons. Satisfied with his will alone, so as to be fully persuaded,
   that, notwithstanding the great depth of his judgments, (Psalm 36:6)
   they are characterized by the most consummate rectitude; this ignorance
   will be far more learned than all the acumen of those who presume to
   make their own capacity the standard by which to measure his works. On
   the other hand, it is deserving of notice, that if God does whatsoever
   he pleases, then it is not his pleasure to do that which is not done.
   The knowledge of this truth is of great importance, because it
   frequently happens, when God winks and holds his peace at the
   afflictions of the Church, that we ask why he permits her to languish,
   since it is in his power to render her assistance. Avarice, fraud,
   perfidy, cruelty, ambition, pride, sensuality, drunkenness, and, in
   short, every species of corruption in these times is rampant in the
   world, all which would instantly cease did it seem good to God to apply
   the remedy. Wherefore, if he at any time appears to us to be asleep, or
   has not the means of succoring us, let this tend to make us wait
   patiently, and to teach us that it is not his pleasure to act so
   speedily the part of our deliverer, because he knows that delay and
   procrastination are profitable to us; it being his will to wink at and
   tolerate for a while what assuredly, were it his pleasure, he could
   instantly rectify.

   [365] "As the former psalm ended abruptly, and this is connected with
   it by the Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, Arabic, Æthiopic, with nineteen
   MSS.; and as the following ejaculations so naturally arise from the
   consideration of the wonderful works of Jehovah just before recited,
   Lorinus's opinion, that it is only a continuation of the former, is not
   improbable. Patrick refers it to 2 Chronicles 20:2. Some suppose it to
   be written by Moses at the Red Sea. Others, by David in the beginning
   of his reign. Others, by Mordecai and Esther. Others, by the three
   children in the fiery furnace. Perhaps by Hezekiah, or some one in the
   Babylonish captivity. -- See Psalm 114:1." -- Dimoch. "There is nothing
   certain," observes Walford, "to be concluded respecting the author of
   this psalm, or the occasion on which it was written. It is conjectured,
   however, to belong to the time of Hezekiah, and to have been composed
   in celebration of the very extraordinary deliverance which was afforded
   to that pious prince, and to his people, from the blasphemies and
   arrogance of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, 2 Chronicles 32; Isaiah
   37:37. Whether this conjecture be agreeable to the truth, we are unable
   to say, though a considerable probability that it is so, arises from
   the language of the psalm itself."

   [366] "Our God, says he, is in heaven, as much as to say, that yours
   are not. The verse may be also regarded as a response to the question
   of the heathen, Where is now their God? Such a response was calculated
   to fortify the minds of the pious worshippers of Jehovah, against the
   ridicule which was heaped upon them by their idolatrous neighbors." --

   Psalm 115:4-8

   4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 5. They
   have a mouth, but they do not speak: they have eyes and see not: 6.
   They have ears, and do not hear: they have noses, and smell not: 7.
   They have hands, and feel not: they have feet, and walk not: they do
   not speak through their throat. [367] 8. Those that make them shall be
   like unto them; and all those who trust to them.


   4 Their idols This contrast is introduced for the purpose of confirming
   the faith of the godly, by which they repose upon God alone; because,
   excepting him, all that the minds of men imagine of divinity is the
   invention of folly and delusion. To know the error and the madness of
   the world certainly contributes in no small degree to the confirmation
   of true godliness; while, on the other hand, a God is presented to us,
   whom we know assuredly to be the maker of heaven and earth, and whom we
   are to worship, not without reason or at random. The more effectually
   to silence the arrogance of the ungodly, who proudly presume to set at
   nought God and his chosen people, he contemptuously ridicules their
   false gods, first calling them idols, that is to say, things of nought,
   and, next, showing from their being formed of inanimate materials, that
   they are destitute of life and feeling. For can there be anything more
   absurd than to expect assistance from them, since neither the materials
   of which they are formed, nor the form which is given to them by the
   hand of men, possess the smallest portion of divinity so as to command
   respect for them? At the same time, the prophet tacitly indicates that
   the value of the material does not invest the idols with more
   excellence so that they deserve to be more highly esteemed. Hence the
   passage may be translated adversatively, thus, Though they are of gold
   and silver, yet they are not gods, because they are the work of men's
   hands. Had it been his intention merely to depreciate the substance of
   which they were composed, he would rather have called them wood and
   stone, but at present he speaks only of gold and silver. In the
   meantime, the prophet reminds us that nothing is more unbecoming than
   for men to say that they can impart either essence, or form, or honor
   to a god, since they themselves are dependent upon another for that
   life which will soon disappear. From this it follows, that the heathen
   vainly boast of receiving help from gods of their own devising. Whence
   does idolatry take its origin but from the imaginations of men? Having
   abundance of materials supplied to their hand, they can make of their
   gold or silver, not only a goblet or some other kind of vessel, but
   also vessels for meaner purposes, but they prefer making a god. And
   what can be more absurd than to convert a lifeless mass into some new
   deity? Besides, the prophet satirically adds, that while the heathen
   fashion members for their idols, they cannot enable them to move or use
   them. It is on this account that the faithful experience their
   privilege to be the more valuable, in that the only true God is on
   their side, and because they are well assured that all the heathen
   vainly boast of the aid which they expect from their idols, which are
   nothing but shadows.

   This is a doctrine, however, which ought to receive a greater latitude
   of meaning; for from it we learn, generally, that it is foolish to seek
   God under outward images, which have no resemblance or relation to his
   celestial glory. To this principle we must still adhere, otherwise it
   would be easy for the heathen to complain that they were unjustly
   condemned, because, though they make for themselves idols upon earth,
   they yet were persuaded that God is in heaven. They did not imagine
   that Jupiter was either composed of stone, or of gold, or of earth, but
   that he was merely represented under these similitudes. Whence
   originated this form of address common among the ancient Romans, "To
   make supplication before the gods," but because they believed the
   images to be, as it were, the representations of the gods? [368] The
   Sicilians, says Cicero, have no gods before whom they can present their
   supplications. He would not have spoken in this barbarous style, had
   the notion not been prevalent, that the figures of the heavenly deities
   were represented to them in brass, or silver, or in marble; [369] and
   cherishing the notion, that in approaching these images the gods were
   nearer to them, the prophet justly exposes this ridiculous fancy, that
   they would enclose the Deity within corruptible representations, since
   nothing is more foreign to the nature of God than to dwell under stone,
   or a piece of marble, or wood, and stock of a tree, or brass, or
   silver. [370] For this reason, the prophet Habakkuk designates that
   gross mode of worshipping God, the school of falsehood. (Habakkuk
   2:18.) Moreover, the scornful manner in which he speaks of their gods
   deserves to be noticed, they have a mouth, but they do not speak; for
   why do we betake ourselves to God, but from the conviction that we are
   dependent upon him for life; that our safety is in him, and that the
   abundance of good, and the power to help us, are with him? As these
   images are senseless and motionless, what can be more absurd than to
   ask from them that of which they themselves are destitute?

   8 They who make them shall be like unto them. Many are of opinion that
   this is an imprecation, and hence translate the future tense in the
   optative mood, may they become like unto them But it will be equally
   appropriate to regard it as the language of ridicule, as if the prophet
   should affirm that the idolaters are equally stupid with the stocks and
   stones themselves. And he deservedly severely reprehends men naturally
   endued with understanding, because they divest themselves of reason and
   judgment, and even of common sense. For those who ask life from things
   which are lifeless, do they not endeavor to the utmost of their power
   to extinguish all the light of reason? In a word, were they possessed
   of a particle of common sense, they would not attribute the properties
   of deity to the works of their own hands, to which they could impart no
   sensation or motion. And surely this consideration alone should suffice
   to remove the plea of ignorance, their making false gods for themselves
   in opposition to the plain dictates of natural reason. As the
   legitimate effect of this, they are willfully blind, envelop themselves
   in darkness, and become stupid; and this renders them altogether
   inexcusable, so that they cannot pretend that their error is the result
   of pious zeal. And I have no doubt that it was the prophet's intention
   to remove every cause and color of ignorance, inasmuch as mankind
   spontaneously become stupid.

   Whosoever trusteth in them. The reason why God holds images so much in
   abhorrence appears very plainly from this, that he cannot endure that
   the worship due to himself should be taken from him and given to them.
   That the world should acknowledge him to be the sole author of
   salvation, and should ask for and expect from him alone all that is
   needed, is an honor which peculiarly belongs to him. And, therefore, as
   often as confidence is reposed in any other than in himself, he is
   deprived of the worship which is due to him, and his majesty is, as it
   were, annihilated. The prophet inveighs against this profanity, even as
   in many passages the indignation of God is compared to jealousy, when
   he beholds idols and false gods receiving the homage of which he has
   been deprived, (Exodus 34:14; Deuteronomy 5:9) If a man carve an image
   of marble, wood, or brass, or if he cast one of gold or silver, this of
   itself would not be so detestable a thing; but when men attempt to
   attach God to their inventions, and to make him, as it were, descend
   from heaven, then a pure fiction is substituted in his place. It is
   very true that God's glory is instantly counterfeited when it is
   invested with a corruptible form; ("To whom hast thou likened me?" he
   exclaims by Isaiah 40:25, and 46:5, and the Scripture abounds with such
   texts;) nevertheless, he is doubly injured when his truth, and grace,
   and power, are imagined to be concentrated in idols. To make idols, and
   then to confide in them, are things which are almost inseparable. Else
   whence is it that the world so strongly desires gods of stone, or of
   wood, or of clay, or of any earthly material, were it not that they
   believe that God is far from them, until they hold him fixed to them by
   some bond? Averse to seek God in a spiritual manner, they therefore
   pull him down from his throne, and place him under inanimate things.
   Thus it comes to pass, that they address their supplications to images,
   because they imagine that in them God's ears, and also his eyes and
   hands, are near to them. I have observed that these two vices can
   hardly be severed, namely, that those who, in forging idols, change the
   truth of God into a lie, must also ascribe something of divinity to
   them. When the prophet says that unbelievers put their trust in idols,
   his design, as I formerly noticed, was to condemn this as the chief and
   most detestable piece of profanity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [367] Hammond reads the last clause, "neither breathe, or murmur, they
   through their throats." "What yhgv here signifies," says he, "will be
   concluded by the context which immediately before had mentioned their
   having mouths and not speaking. Here, therefore, (as there the proper
   action of the mouth was speech,) the proper action of the throat or
   larynx seems to be intended, and that is to breathe. So when, Psalm
   90:9, he saith, We consume our days, kmv hgh, the Targum reads, hyk hvl
   phvm', as a vapor,' i.e., breath of the mouth in winter.' If this is
   not the sense, then certainly it is an inarticulate sound,
   contradistinct from speaking. So Kimchi and Aben Ezra state it, and
   quote Isaiah 38:14, where the word is applied to the murmuring of the
   dove."

   [368] "Car que vouloit dire ceste facon de parler dont usoyent les
   anciens Romains, faire oraison deuant les dieux sinon qu'ils estimoyent
   que les idoles estoyent comme les representations des dieux?" -- Fr.

   [369] But though these images might, at first, be intended merely to
   bring the real Deity before the senses, and thus to impress the mind
   the more deeply with sentiments of awe and devotion, yet in process of
   time they began to be considered, especially by the ignorant multitude,
   as being really gods.

   [370] The heathen not only considered their idols or images as
   representing their gods, but believed that, when consecrated by their
   priests, they were thereby animated by the gods whom they represented,
   and hence were worshipped as such. "Augustine (De Civitate Dei, B. 8,
   c. 23) tells us of the theology of the heathen, received from
   Trismegistus, that statues were the bodies of their gods, which, by
   some magical ceremonies, or theourgiai, were forced to join themselves
   as souls, and so animate and enliven those dead organs, to assume and
   inhabit them. And so Proclus (De Sacrif et Mag.) mentions it as the
   common opinion of the Gentiles, that the gods were, by their favor and
   help, present in their images;' and, therefore, the Tyrians, fearing
   that Apollo would forsake them, bound his image with golden chains,
   supposing then the god could not depart from them. The like did the
   Athenians imagine when they clipped the wings of the image of Victory;
   and the Sicilians, in Cicero, (De Divin.) who complain that they had no
   gods in their island, because Verres, Praetor in Sicily, had taken away
   all their statues. And so we know Laban, when he had lost his Teraphim,
   tells Jacob, (Genesis 31:30,) that he had stolen his gods;' and so of
   the golden calf, after the feasts of consecration, proclamation is made
   before it, These be thy gods, O Israel!' But this of the animation and
   inspiriting of images, by their rites of consecration, being but a
   deception and fiction of their priests, the Psalmist here discovers it,
   and assures all men that they are as inanimate and senseless after the
   consecration as before; base silver and gold, with images of mouths and
   ears, etc., but without any power to use any of them, and,
   consequently, most unable to hear or help their votaries." -- Hammond

   Psalm 115:9-15

   9. O Israel! Trust [371] thou in Jehovah: he is their help and their
   shield. 10. O house of Aaron! trust ye in Jehovah: he is their help and
   their shield. 11. Ye that fear Jehovah! trust in Jehovah: he is their
   help and their shield. 12. Jehovah has been mindful of us; he will
   bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of
   Aaron. 13. He will bless them that fear Jehovah, both the small with
   the great. 14. Jehovah will add unto you, unto you and unto your
   children. 15. Blessed are ye of Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.


   9 O Israel! trust thou in Jehovah The prophet again resumes the
   doctrinal point, that the genuine worshippers of God have no cause to
   fear that he will forsake or frustrate them in the time of need;
   because he is as much disposed to provide for their safety as he is
   furnished with power to do it. He proceeds, in the first place, to
   exhort all the Israelites generally to place their confidence in God;
   and, secondly, he addresses the house of Aaron in particular; and,
   thirdly, he sets down all who fear God. For this arrangement there was
   good cause. God had adopted indiscriminately all the people, to whom
   also his grace was offered, so that they were bound in common to place
   their hope in him. In accordance with this Paul says, that the twelve
   tribes of Israel wait for the promised deliverance, (Acts 26:7) The
   prophet, therefore, with great propriety first addresses Israel at
   large. But having in a peculiar manner set apart the Levites for
   himself, and more especially the priests of the house of Aaron, to take
   the precedence, and to preside over ecclesiastical matters, he demands
   more from them than from the common people; not that salvation was
   promised specially to them, but because it was proper that they who had
   the exclusive privilege of entering the sanctuary should point out the
   way to others. As if the prophet had said, Ye sons of Aaron, whom God
   hath chosen to be the teachers of religion to his people, be ye to
   others an example of faith, seeing that he hath so highly honored you
   in permitting you to enter his sanctuary.

   11. Ye who fear Jehovah! He does not speak of strangers, as some
   erroneously suppose, as if this were a prediction respecting the
   calling of the Gentiles. Connecting them with the children of Israel
   and with the sons of Aaron, they are of opinion that he refers to the
   heathens and to the uncircumcised who were not yet gathered into the
   sheepfold. By parity of reason one might infer, that the priests are
   not of the seed of Abraham, because they are separately mentioned. It
   is more probable that there is in these words a tacit correction of
   what he had said before, by which he makes a distinction between the
   genuine worshippers of God and those hypocrites who were the degenerate
   sons of Abraham. Not a few of the seed of Abraham according to the
   flesh having departed from the faith of their father, the prophet here
   restricts the promise to those who, having received it by faith, were
   worshipping God in purity. We now perceive the reason for his first
   addressing the Israelites, next the house of Aaron, and then the
   fearers of Jehovah It is as if a person in our times were to point his
   exhortation first to the whole body of the Church, and then come more
   particularly to the ministers and teachers, who ought to be ensamples
   to others. And as many falsely pique themselves upon the mere name of
   being connected with the Church, and hence deserve not to be classed
   with God's true followers, he expressly mentions the genuine and not
   the counterfeit worshippers of God.

   12 Jehovah hath remembered us Many render the term bless in the past
   tense, he has blessed, it being the design of the prophet, according to
   them, to propose the past experience of God's kindness as an
   encouragement to cherish good hope for the future: "We have already,
   from long experience, been taught how valuable the favor of our God is,
   because from this source alone have flowed our prosperity, our
   abundance, and our stability." He assumes the principle, the truth of
   which ought to be admitted by all, that we neither enjoy prosperity nor
   happiness further than it pleases God to bless us. As often as the
   Israelites were rescued from manifold dangers, or succored in time of
   need, or treated in a friendly manner, so many palpable proofs had they
   of the loving-kindness of God towards them. As, however, there is no
   just cause to urge us to change the verb from the future into the past
   tense, it is quite in unison with the scope of the passage, if we say
   that the same blessing is here promised to the faithful which they have
   formerly realized. Thus the meaning will be, that God, mindful of his
   covenant, has hitherto been attentive to us; therefore, as he has begun
   to favor us, he will continue to do so for ever. In pronouncing these
   blessings, he observes the same order as above, assigning to the
   children of Aaron a superior place in God's benediction, excluding from
   it those among the Israelites who were hypocrites.

   He says, both the small with the great, by which circumstance he
   magnifies God's paternal regard the more, showing that he does not
   overlook even the meanest and most despised, provided they cordially
   invoke his aid. Now, as there is no acceptance of persons before God,
   our low and abject condition ought to be no obstruction to our drawing
   near to him, since he so kindly invites to approach him those who
   appear to be held in no reputation. Moreover, the repetition of the
   word bless is intended to mark the uninterrupted stream of his
   loving-kindness. Should any prefer the past tense, he has blessed, the
   meaning will be, that the favor of God towards his people has continued
   for a long period, which ought to be a sure evidence of the perpetuity
   of his fatherly regard. This interpretation is strengthened by the
   subsequent verse, in which he says, that God would multiply the
   benefits which he had up to that time conferred upon them. For God's
   liberality is an inexhaustible fountain, which will never cease to flow
   so long as its progress is not impeded by the ingratitude of men. And
   hence it will be continued to their posterity, because God manifests
   the grace and the fruit of his adoption even to a thousand generations.

   15. Ye are blessed of Jehovah In the preceding verse the prophet had
   given them the hope of uninterrupted happiness, arising from God's
   infinite resources never failing, however liberally and largely he
   bestows, and from his never ceasing to enrich those whom he hath
   admitted as sharers of his bounty. In confirmation of this doctrine, he
   declares that the children of Abraham were separated from other
   nations; so that, relying upon this privilege, they might
   unhesitatingly and unreservedly surrender themselves to a father so
   benignant and bountiful. And as the flesh, in consequence of its
   stupidity, cannot perceive the power of God, the understanding of which
   preserves us in a state of peace and security under his protection, the
   prophet, in designating him the maker of heaven and earth, reminds us
   that there is no ground to fear that he is unable to defend us; for,
   having created the heaven and the earth, he does not now remain
   unconcerned in heaven, but all creation is under his sovereign control.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [371] Many interpreters translate the verb trust, which occurs here and
   in the next two verses, in the indicative mood, "Israel trusteth in
   Jehovah," etc.; judging this to be more agreeable to the occasion than
   the imperative, which is found in the present copies of the Hebrew
   text. This emendation is supported by all the ancient versions.

   Psalm 115:16-18

   16. The heavens, the heavens are Jehovah's: but the earth he hath given
   to the children of men. 17. O God! the dead shall not praise thee, nor
   those who go down to silence. 18. But we will bless God from this time,
   and for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.


   16 The heavens, the heavens are Jehovah's In this passage the prophet
   extols the bounty of God, and his paternal regard for the human race,
   in that, though he stood in need of nothing himself, he yet created the
   world, with all its fullness, for their use. How comes it to pass that
   the earth is every where covered with such a great variety of good
   things, meeting our eye in all directions, unless that God, as a
   provident father of a family, had designed to make provision for our
   wants? In proportion, therefore, to the comforts which we here enjoy,
   are the tokens of his fatherly care. This is the prophet's meaning,
   which I am astonished is so little attended to by the most of
   interpreters. The amount is, that God, satisfied with his own glory,
   has enriched the earth with abundance of good things, that mankind may
   not lack any thing. At the same time he demonstrates, that, as God has
   his dwelling-place in the heavens, he must be independent of all
   worldly riches; for, assuredly, neither wine, nor corn, nor any thing
   requisite for the support of the present life is produced there.
   Consequently, God has every resource in himself. To this circumstance
   the repetition of the, term heavens refers, The heavens, the heavens
   are enough for God; and as he is superior to all aid, he is to himself
   instead of a hundred worlds. It remains, therefore, as another
   consequence from this, that all the riches with which the world abounds
   proclaim aloud what a beneficent father God is to mankind. It is indeed
   surprising that there should be no relish for this doctrine,
   considering that the Holy Spirit spoke of the inestimable goodness of
   God. Under the papacy, they chanted this psalm in their churches, and
   they continue the practice still; but is there one among a hundred of
   them who reflects that God, in bestowing all good things upon us,
   reserves nothing for himself, except a grateful acknowledgment of them?
   And not only in this matter does the ingratitude of the world appear,
   but the wicked wretches have conducted themselves most vilely, in open
   and infamous blasphemy; perverting this verse, and making a jest of it,
   saying that God remains unconcerned in heaven, and pays no regard to
   the affairs of men. The prophet here expressly declares that the world
   is employed by God, for the sole purpose of testifying his paternal
   solicitude towards mankind; and yet these swine and dogs have made
   these words a laughing-stock, as if God, by reason of his vast distance
   from men, totally disregarded them. And here I am induced to relate a
   memorable story. While we were supping in a certain inn, and speaking
   of the hope of the heavenly life, a profane despiser of God happening
   to be present, treated our discourse with derision, and now and then
   mockingly exclaimed, "The heaven of heavens is the Lord's." Instantly
   afterwards he was seized with dreadful pain, and began to vociferate,
   "O God! O God!" and, having a powerful voice, he filled the whole
   apartment with his cries. Then I, who had felt indignant at his
   conduct, proceeded, in my own way, to tell him warmly, that now at
   least he perceived that they who mocked God were not permitted to
   escape with impunity. One of the guests, an honest and pious man, yet
   alive, but withal facetious, employed the occasion thus, "Do you invoke
   God? Have you forgotten your philosophy? Why do you not permit him to
   remain at ease in his own heaven?" And as often as the one bawled out,
   "O God!" the other, mocking him, retorted, "Where is now thy Coelum
   coeli Domino?" At that time his pain indeed was mitigated;
   nevertheless, the remainder of his life was spent in impunity.

   17 O God! the dead shall not praise thee In these words the prophet
   goes on to beseech God to show himself propitious towards his Church,
   were there no other object to be gained than the preventing mankind
   from being utterly cut off, and the preserving a people, not only to
   enjoy his kindness, but also to invoke and praise his name. After
   celebrating God's peculiar favor towards the Israelites, and the
   beneficence which he displayed towards mankind at large, he has
   recourse to the mercy of God for the pardoning of the sins of his
   people. And he proceeds on this footing, that though the heathen
   nations revel amidst the profuseness of God's bounty, yet the seed of
   Abraham alone are set apart to celebrate his praises. "Lord, if thou
   shouldst allow us to perish, what would be the result, but that thy
   name would become extinct, and would be entombed with us?" From his
   appearing to deprive the dead of all sensibility, a question occurs: If
   souls, after they have departed from their corporeal prison, still
   survive? It is certain that they are then more vigorous and active,
   and; therefore, it must inevitably follow that God is also praised by
   the dead. Moreover, in appointing mankind their abode upon earth, he so
   disconnects them with God, that he leaves them a life such as they
   enjoy in common with the brutal tribes. For the earth was not given
   exclusively to men, but also to oxen, swine, dogs, lions, and bears,
   and what is more, to every sort of reptile and insect. For there is not
   a fly, nor a creeping thing, however mean, which the earth does not
   supply with an abode. [372] The solution of the first question is easy.
   Men were so situated on the earth that they might, as it were, with one
   voice celebrate the praises of God. And it was to this concord that the
   prophet in this place referred, as does also the Scripture in many
   other passages.

   "I shall not die, but live, and declare the words of the Lord,"
   (Psalm 118: 17).

   The good king Hezekiah also, said,

   "The living, the living, he shall praise thee," (Isaiah 38:19).

   Jonah, too, when cast out of the belly of the fish, said,

   "I will offer sacrifices, and I will pay my vows unto the Lord," (Jonah
   2:10.) [373]

   In short, the prophet very justly excludes the dead from taking any
   part in the celebration of God's praises; for among them there is no
   communion and fellowship qualifying them for mutually sounding forth
   his praises: the proclaiming of his glory on the earth being the very
   end of our existence. The reply to the second inquiry is this: The
   prophet says that the earth was given to mankind, that they might
   employ themselves in God's service, until they be put in possession of
   everlasting felicity. True, indeed, the abundance of the earth belongs
   also to the brutal tribes; but the Holy Spirit declares that all things
   were created principally for the use of men, that they might thereby
   recognize God as their father. In fine, the prophet concludes that the
   whole course of nature would be subverted, unless God saved his Church.
   The creation of the world would serve no good purpose, if there were no
   people to call upon God. Hence he infers that there will always be some
   left alive upon the earth. And he not only promises that the Church
   shall be preserved, but also calls upon all who are thus preserved to
   offer a tribute of gratitude to their deliverer; and, moreover, he
   engages in their name to set forth the praises of God. He does not
   speak merely of the persons who belong to one age, but of the whole
   body of the Church which God upholds from one generation after another,
   that he may never leave himself without some to testify and declare his
   justice, goodness, and mercy.

   [373] Thus the present text of Scripture, and others of a similar kind,
   as Psalm 6:6; 30:10; 88:11; and Isaiah 38:18, 19, are not to be
   understood as implying that the Hebrews of those times had no idea of a
   future state of existence beyond death and the grave. Such an
   interpretation would be at variance with many passages of the Old
   Testament, as Psalm 16:10; 49:15; 73:24; Proverbs 14:32; Ecclesiastes
   8:11-13; 11:9; 12:14; with the most explicit declarations of the New,
   as to the possession of this knowledge by the ancient Hebrews, Hebrews
   11; Luke 20:37; and with what might reasonably be supposed of persons
   who were favored with a supernatural revelation, and who enjoyed
   special intercourse with God, but who, had they been ignorant of a
   future state, knew less on this subject than Pagan writers, many of
   whom anticipated such a state in which virtue would receive its
   appropriate reward. In such passages the sensible appearances
   occasioned by death, and these alone, are represented. As to the eye of
   sense, nothing appears in the victim of death but inactivity, silence,
   decay, and corruption, the sacred writers seize upon these concomitants
   of that solemn and affecting event to add to the force of the argument
   which they are prosecuting.

   PSALM 116

   David, being delivered out of very great dangers, relates what cruel
   torment and anguish of mind he endured, and then how remarkably he was
   preserved by God. The desperate state of matters with him tended to
   make the power of God in his preservation more conspicuous; for had not
   God interposed for his deliverance, all hope would have failed. In this
   way he stirs himself up to gratitude, and acknowledges that he can make
   no other return to him for his innumerable benefits. [374]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 116:1-4

   1. I have loved, because Jehovah shall hear the voice of my
   supplication. 2. Because he hath inclined his ear to me, and during my
   days I will call upon him. 3. The snares [375] of death compassed me,
   [376] and the sorrows of the grave found me: [377] I found tribulation
   and grief. 4. And I will call upon the name of Jehovah; I beseech thee,
   O Jehovah! deliver my soul.


   1 I have loved, because Jehovah will hear the voice of my supplication.
   At the very commencement of this psalm David avows that he was
   attracted with the sweetness of God's goodness, to place his hope and
   confidence in him alone. This abrupt mode of speaking, I have loved, is
   the more emphatic, intimating that he could receive joy and repose
   nowhere but in God. We know that our hearts will be always wandering
   after fruitless pleasures, and harassed with care, until God knit them
   to himself. This distemper David affirms was removed from him, because
   he felt that God was indeed propitious towards him. And, having found
   by experience that, in general, they who call upon God are happy, he
   declares that no allurements shall draw him away from God. When,
   therefore, he says, I have loved, it imports that, without God, nothing
   would be pleasant or agreeable to him. From this we are instructed that
   those who have been heard by God, but do not place themselves entirely
   under his guidance and guardianship, have derived little advantage from
   the experience of his grace.

   The second verse also refers to the same subject, excepting that the
   latter clause admits of a very appropriate meaning, which expositors
   overlook. The phrase, during my days I will call upon him, is uniformly
   understood by them to mean, I, who hitherto have been so successful in
   addressing God, will pursue the same course all my life long. But it
   should be considered whether it may not be equally appropriate that the
   days of David be regarded as denoting a fit season of asking
   assistance, the season when he was hard pressed by necessity. I am not
   prevented from adopting this signification, because it may be said that
   the prophet employs the future tense of the verb 'qr', ekra. In the
   first verse also, the term, he shall hear, is to be understood in the
   past tense, he has heard, in which case the copulative conjunction
   would require to be taken as an adverb of time, when, a circumstance
   this by no means unusual among the Hebrews. The scope of the passage
   will run very well thus: Because he has bowed his ear to me when I
   called upon him in the time of my adversity, and even at the season,
   too, when I was reduced to the greatest straits. If any are disposed to
   prefer the former exposition, I will not dispute the matter with them.
   The subsequent context, however, appears to countenance the latter
   meaning, in which David commences energetically to point out what those
   days were. And, with the design of magnifying God's glory according to
   its desert, he says that there was no way of his escaping from death,
   for he was like one among enemies, bound with fetters and chains, from
   whom all hope of deliverance was cut off. He acknowledges, therefore,
   that he was subjected to death, that he was overtaken and seized, so
   that escape was impossible. And as he declares that he was bound by the
   cords of death, so he, at the same the adds, that he fell into
   tribulation and sorrow And here he confirms what he said formerly, that
   when he seemed to be most forsaken of God, that was truly the proper
   time, and the right season for him to give himself to prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [375] The root of the Hebrew word chvly, cheblei, here rendered snares,
   "is chvl, which signifies to bind, and in Piel conj., to pain, or
   torment. Geseius, in his Thesaurus, under chvl, says: -- Pi. i. q. Kal,
   No. 1, torsit, inde cum tormentis et doloribus enixa est ' chvl
   consequently signifies pain, or cable. It would seem from the verb to
   which it is a subject, that the latter is the more suitable sense,
   whilst the parallelism is in favor of the former. The former, however,
   is here contained in the latter, for the expression chvly mvt alludes
   to the custom of binding the victims for slaughter, or malefactors when
   taken to the place of execution; which binding was productive of great
   pain." -- Phillips. See [21]volume 1, page 264. Cresswell reads, "The
   straits of the grave, that is, the terrors of instant death, had found
   me."

   [376] " -- compassed me.' The original word 'phph expresses the
   repetition of the encircling of the toils. They surrounded him again
   and again." -- Horsley.

   [377] Fry's translation of this clause is: -- "The nets of Hades had
   caught hold upon me;" on which he has the following note: -- "Or,
   according to the usual meaning of tsvr and tsrr, the pangs or pains of
   hell.' It is not impossible, indeed, that it should be derived from
   ntsr; we might then render, The purveyors of Hades had found me:' and
   the imagery, at any rate, seems to be taken from the toils of the
   hunter. Michaelis would read mtsvdy, nets,' instead of mtsvry, pangs;
   but it is very probable that, without any change, mtsvry signifies some
   part of the apparatus of hunting. mtsr a strait, distress, angustia '
   Psalm 118:5; 116:3; Lamentations 1:3. In which last text, Mr Lowth says
   that there is a metaphor from those that hunt a prey, which they drive
   into some strait and narrow passage, from whence there is no making an
   escape.'"

   Psalm 116:5-9

   5. Jehovah is gracious and just; our God is merciful. 6. Jehovah guards
   the simple; I was brought low, and he saved me. 7. Return, O my soul!
   into thy rest; for Jehovah hath recompensed unto thee. 8. Because thou
   hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet
   from falling. 9. I will walk in the presence of Jehovah in the land of
   the living.


   5 Jehovah is gracious. He comes now to point out the fruits of that
   love of which he spoke, setting before him God's titles, in order that
   they might serve to preserve his faith in him. First, he denominates
   him gracious, because he is so ready graciously to render assistance.
   From this source springs that justice which he displays for the
   protection of his own people. To this is subjoined mercy, without which
   we would not deserve God's aid. And as the afflictions which overtake
   us frequently appear to preclude the exercise of his justice, hence it
   follows that there is nothing better than to repose upon him alone; so
   that his fatherly kindness may engross our thoughts, and that no
   voluptuous pleasure may steal them away to any thing else. He then
   accommodates the experience of God's benignity and equity to the
   preserving of the simple, that is, of such as, being undesigning, do
   not possess the requisite prudence for managing their own affairs. The
   term, rendered simple, is often understood in a bad sense, denoting
   persons inconsiderate and foolish, who will not follow wholesome
   advice. But, in this place, it is applied to those who are exposed to
   the abuse of the wicked, who are not sufficiently subtle and
   circumspect to elude the snares which are laid for them, -- in short,
   to those who are easily overreached; while, on the contrary, the
   children of this world are full of ingenuity, and have every means at
   their command for maintaining and protecting themselves. David,
   therefore, acknowledges himself to be as a child, unable to consult his
   own safety, and totally unfit to ward off the dangers to which he was
   exposed. Hence the LXX. have not improperly translated the Hebrew term
   by the Greek, ta nepia, little children. [378] The amount is, that when
   those who are liable to suffering have neither the prudence nor the
   means of effecting their deliverance, God manifests his wisdom towards
   them, and interposes the secret protection of his providence between
   them and all the dangers by which their safety may be assailed. In
   fine, David holds forth himself as a personal example of this fact, in
   that, after being reduced to the greatest straits, he had, by the grace
   of God, been restored to his former state.

   7 Return, O my soul! unto thy rest. He now exhorts himself to be of
   good courage; or rather, addressing his soul, tells it to be tranquil,
   because God was propitious towards him. By the term rest, some
   commentators understand God himself, but this is an unnatural
   interpretation. It is rather to be regarded as expressive of a calm and
   composed state of mind. For it is to be noticed, that David confesses
   himself to have been sorely agitated and perplexed amid an accumulation
   of ills, in the same way as each of us is conscious of his own
   inquietude, when the terrors of death encompass us. Although,
   therefore, David possessed unusual fortitude, he was yet distressed by
   reason of the conflict of grief, and an inward tremor so distracted his
   mind, that he justly complains of being deprived of his peace. He
   declares, however, that the grace of God was adequate to quiet all
   these troubles.

   It may be asked, whether the experience of the grace of God alone can
   allay the fear and trepidation of our minds; since David declares,
   that, having experienced relief from Divine aid, he would, for the
   future, be at rest? If the faithful regain their peace of mind only
   when God manifests himself as their deliverer, what room is there for
   the exercise of faith, and what power will the promises possess? For,
   assuredly, to wait calmly and silently for those indications of God's
   favor, which he conceals from us, is the undoubted evidence of faith.
   And strong faith quiets the conscience, and composes the spirit; so
   that, according to Paul, "the peace of God, which passeth all
   understandings" reigns supremely there, Philippians 4:7. And hence the
   godly remain unmoved, though the whole world were about to go to ruin.
   What is the import of this returning unto rest? I answer, that however
   much the children of God may be driven hither and thither, yet they
   constantly derive support from the word of God, so that they cannot
   totally and finally fall away. Confiding in his promises, they throw
   themselves upon his providence; and still they are sorely distressed by
   disquieting fears, and sadly buffeted by the storms of temptation. No
   sooner does God come to their assistance, than not only inward peace
   takes possession of their minds, but, from the manifestation of his
   grace, they are supplied with grounds for joy and gladness. Of this
   latter kind of quietness David here treats -- declaring that,
   notwithstanding of all the prevalence of agitation of mind, it was now
   time for him to delight himself calmly in God. The term gml, gamal, is
   improperly rendered to reward; because, in Hebrew, it usually signifies
   to confer a favor, as well as to give a recompense; which is confirmed
   by him in the following verse, in which he says that his soul was
   delivered from death. This, then, properly speaking, is the recompense;
   namely, that God, in delivering him from death, had wiped away the
   tears from his eyes. The arrangement of the words is transposed; for,
   according to our idiom, we would rather have said, he hath delivered my
   feet from falling; and mine eyes from tears, and then he hath delivered
   my soul from death; for we are wont to follow that arrangement, by
   which the most important circumstance comes to be mentioned last. Among
   the Hebrews such a collocation of the words, as in this passage, is by
   no means improper. This is their import: God has not only rescued me
   from present death, but also treated me with farther kindness, in
   chasing away sorrow, and stretching out his hand to prevent me from
   stumbling. The grace of God is enhanced, in that he restored to life
   one who had been almost dead.

   9 I will walk in the presence of Jehovah. To walk in the presence of
   God is, in my opinion, equivalent to living under his charge. And thus
   David expects to enjoy his safety continually. For nothing is more
   desirable than that God should be upon the watch for us, that our life
   may be surrounded by his protecting care. The wicked, indeed, regard
   themselves as secure, the farther they are from God; but the godly
   consider themselves happy in this one thing, that he directs the whole
   tenor of their life. God adding, in the land of the living, he means to
   point out to us the course that we are expected to pursue; and that,
   almost every moment of time, fresh destructions press upon us, if he
   overlook us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [378] This rendering of the LXX. also suggests the idea of weakness,
   which Fry has adopted, who reads, "Jehovah preserveth the weak." "The
   usual meaning of pht'ym," says he, "is simplices, fatui, persuasu
   faciles; but I believe the Septuagint has preserved the true meaning of
   the passage, Phulasson ta nepia ho kurios. The leading idea of phth is
   laxity or yielding, and may as well apply to the weakness of the body,
   or of the faculties of the mind, under the pressure of grief and pain,
   as to the relaxing of the powers of the understanding, in yielding to
   the seductions of folly or vice."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 116:10-11

   10. I have believed, therefore I will speak; [379] I am afflicted very
   sore. 11. I said in my fear, Every man is a liar. [380]


   10. I have believed That his wonderful deliverance may appear the more
   conspicuous, he again relates the imminent danger in which he had been
   placed. He begins by declaring that he spake in the true sincerity of
   his heart, and that nothing proceeded from his lips but what was the
   fruit of long reflection, and mature deliberation. Such is the import
   of the clause, I have believed, therefore I will speak; words which
   proceed from the full affection of the heart. In 2 Corinthians 4:13,
   Paul, quoting this passage, follows the Greek version, "I believed,
   therefore I have spoken." I have elsewhere remarked that it was not the
   design of the apostles to repeat every word and syllable; it is enough
   for us that the words of David are appropriately applied in their
   proper and natural sense to the subject to which Paul there refers.
   Having referred indirectly to the Corinthians, who were exalting
   themselves above the clouds, as if they had been exempted from the
   common lot of mankind, "I believed" says he, "and therefore I have
   spoken, that he who hath once raised Christ from the dead, will also
   extend Christ's life to us;" that is, I believe, and therefore I speak.
   Thus he charges the Corinthians with being inflated with foolish pride,
   because they do not humbly submit to the cross of Christ; especially as
   they ought to speak in the exercise of the same spirit of faith with
   himself. The particle ky, ki, which we translate therefore, is by some
   Hebrew interpreters understood as a disjunctive particle; but the more
   correct meaning, and which is supported by the best scholars, is, I
   will speak nothing but the sentiments of my heart. The drift of the
   passage, too, requires this; namely, that the external professions of
   the lips correspond with the internal feelings of the heart: for many
   talk inconsiderately, and utter what never entered into their hearts.
   "Let no person imagine that I employ unmeaning or exaggerated terms;
   what I speak, the same I have truly believed." From this we learn the
   useful doctrine, that faith cannot remain inoperative in the heart, but
   that it must, of necessity, manifest itself. Here the Holy Spirit
   unites, with a sacred bond, the faith of the heart with outward
   confession; and "what God hath joined together, let not man put
   asunder." Those dissemblers, therefore, who spontaneously envelop their
   faith in obscurity, treacherously corrupt the whole Word of God. We
   must remember, however, that the order which David here observes is
   demanded of all God's children, their believing, before they make any
   professions with their lips. But, as I said, he speaks of his imminent
   danger, that he may the more enhance the safety and deliverance which
   God had vouchsafed to him.

   11. I said in my fear Some take the word chphz, chaphaz, to denote
   haste or flight, and consider it as expressive of what David said when
   he fled in great haste from the face of Saul. But, as it figuratively
   signifies fear, I have no doubt that David here declares that he felt
   astonished and dejected in spirit, as if he were upon the brink of a
   precipice, ready to tumble into the abyss. He acknowledges that, when
   he was so dreadfully harassed in mind, his heart had almost sunk within
   him. Annotators are not agreed about the meaning of the second member
   of the verse. One class holding that David declares that he doubted the
   promise of the kingdom made to him by the prophet Samuel. That Samuel
   was a competent witness, admits of no question; but when David saw
   himself banished from his native country, and constantly exposed to
   death in various forms, he might be overtaken by the temptation that he
   had been vainly and ineffectually anointed by Samuel. According to
   them, the meaning is -- I had almost perished in my flight, and the
   promise given me fled away; and, moreover, I had been deceived by
   delusive hope. Another class, putting an opposite interpretation upon
   this passage, assert that David surmounted the temptation; so that,
   when Satan by his wiles wished to make him despair, he instantly
   recovered himself; and removed all occasion of unbelief in the
   following manner: "What art thou doing, miserable man that thou art,
   and whither art thou hastening? Darest thou, even indirectly, impute
   falsehood to God? Nay, rather let him be true, and let vanity, and
   falsehood, and perfidy, lie at thine own door." My own opinion is, that
   this doctrine is to be understood more generally, that David did not
   intend this prediction directly for himself; but, his mind being
   perplexed, he inadvertently entangled himself in the snares of Satan,
   and was unable to place his confidence any where. The faithful often
   stagger, and Satan bringing them into a state of deep darkness, the
   word of God almost forsakes them; still they do not abandon their
   confidence, nor deliberately charge God with falsehood, but rather keep
   their evil thoughts under restraint. The verb to say, among the
   Hebrews, is expressive of firm persuasion, as we say in French, J'ay
   conclu, ou resolu, "I have concluded, or resolved;" and, therefore, we
   are to understand that this temptation could not enter David's heart,
   without his instantly withstanding it. Consequently, the view which I
   have given of the passage is the proper one, That David did not see God
   during this season of mental darkness. The faithful do not deliberately
   speak against God, or ask whether he be true or not, nor does this
   horrid blasphemy completely engross their thoughts; but, on the
   contrary, as often as it arises, they banish it from them, and hold it
   in abhorrence. Nevertheless, it occasionally happens that they are so
   troubled, that they behold nothing except vanity and falsehood. Such
   was David's experience during this fear and trouble; he felt as if a
   dense fog obstructed his vision. "There is no certainty, no security.
   What shall I think? In what shall I confide? To what shall I have
   recourse?" Frequently do the faithful thus reason with themselves,
   there is no trust to be reposed in men. A veil is spread over their
   eyes, which, preventing them from seeing the light of God, causes them
   to grovel upon the earth, till, being elevated above the heavens, they
   begin anew to discern the truth of God.

   The design of David, as I formerly observed, is in all respects to
   magnify the grace of God; and for this purpose, in speaking of his
   trials, he acknowledges that he did not deserve divine help and
   comfort; for he ought to have recollected, that, depending on the
   prophecy, he would have risen superior to all unbelief. This, he says,
   he did not do, because, owing to the perturbation of his mind, he could
   see nothing but vanity. If his faith was shaken in this violent manner,
   what will we do if God do not support and sustain us? This is not meant
   to keep the faithful in suspense between doubt and uncertainty, but
   rather to make them call more earnestly upon God. We ought to consider
   this trial attentively, for we can form no conception of these assaults
   until we actually experience them. Let us at the same time remember,
   that David's attack was only temporary, continuing while he was
   perplexed with doubt, in consequence of the prophecy having escaped
   from his recollection.

   say, therefore I make no scruple of saying it. This should be connected
   with the preceding verse, and the full stop should be placed at
   spoken.'" -- Horsley.

   [380] Horsley's version of this verse is as follows: "In an ecstasy of
   despair, I said, the whole race of man is a delusion.' A delusion,' a
   lie, a cheat, a thing of nothing, made to no purpose. So Mudge
   understands this latter part. He judiciously observes, that the
   prefixed h necessarily determines the phrase, kl h'dm, to the
   collective sense of the whole race. Every man, or all men, should be kl
   'dm, without h." Fry similarly translates, "The entire of the manhood
   is a lie; or," he observes, "(as the word we render lie signifies,) a
   thing failing and disappointing the hopes built upon it."

   Psalm 116:12-14

   12. What shall I render unto Jehovah? all his benefits are upon me. 13.
   I will take the cup of salvation, [381] and call upon the name of
   Jehovah. 14. I will pay my vows to Jehovah now in the presence of all
   his people.


   12. What shall I render unto Jehovah? He now exclaims with devout
   admiration, that the multitude of God's benefits was greater than he
   could find language to give expression to the grateful emotions of his
   heart. The question is emphatic, What shall I render? and imports, that
   it was not the desire, but the means, of which he was destitute, to
   enable him to render thanks to God. Acknowledging his inability, he
   adopts the only means in his power, by extolling the grace of God as
   highly as he could. "I am exceedingly wishful to discharge my duty, but
   when I look around me, I find nothing which will prove an adequate
   recompense." Some understand the phrase, upon me, to intimate, that
   David had the recollection of all the benefits which God bestowed on
   him deeply engraven upon his mind. Others, along with the LXX., supply
   the particle for, What shall I render unto Jehovah for all his benefits
   towards me? But it is much better to make the first clause of the verse
   a complete sentence, by putting a period after Jehovah. Because, after
   confessing his incompetency, or rather his having nothing to offer to
   God as a sufficient compensation for his benefits, he at the same time
   adds in confirmation of it, that he was laid under such obligations,
   not by one series of benefits only, but by a variety of innumerable
   benefits. "There is no benefit on account of which God has not made me
   a debtor to him, how should I have means of repaying him for them?" All
   recompense failing him, he has recourse to an expression of
   thanksgiving as the only return which he knows will be acceptable to
   God. David's example in this instance teaches us not to treat God's
   benefits lightly or carelessly, for if we estimate them according to
   their value, the very thought of them ought to fill us with admiration.
   There is not one of us who has not God's benefits heaped upon us. But
   our pride, which carries us away into extravagant theories, causes us
   to forget this very doctrine, which ought nevertheless to engage our
   unremitting attention. And God's bounty towards us merits the more
   praise, that he expects no recompense from us, nor can receive any, for
   he stands in need of nothing, and we are poor and destitute of all
   things.

   13. The cup of salvation He refers to a custom which was prevalent
   under the Law. For when they rendered solemn thanks to God, a feast was
   also appointed, at which, in token of their gladness, there was an holy
   libation. This being a symbol of their deliverance from Egyptian
   thraldom, is for that reason here called the cup of salvation [382] The
   term to call upon, signifies to celebrate the name of God; and this he
   expresses more plainly, subsequently, by saying that he would pay his
   vows in the assembly of the faithful, the sanctuary alone being the
   place where sacrifices could be offered. The amount is, that the
   faithful need not be greatly perplexed about the way of performing
   their duties, God not demanding from them a return which he knows they
   are unable to give, but being satisfied with a bare and simple
   acknowledgment. The proper return is to own our obligation to him for
   every thing. If God deal so kindly and mercifully with us, and we fail
   in giving to him the tribute of praise for our deliverance which he
   claims, then our supineness becomes the more base. And certainly they
   are unworthy of the enjoyment, I say not of the riches of the world,
   but of the light of the sun and the air by which we breathe and live,
   who would rob the Author of them of the small return which so
   legitimately belongs to him. The Mosaic ritual has indeed been
   abrogated, and along with it the external libation referred to by
   David, yet the spiritual service, as we found in Psalm 50:23, "The
   sacrifice of praise shall glorify me," is still in force. Let us,
   however, bear in mind, that God is lawfully praised by us, when we
   offer in sacrifice not only our tongues, but also ourselves, and all
   that we possess. And this not because God derives any profit from it,
   but because it is reasonable that our gratitude should manifest itself
   in this way.

   14 I will pay my vows unto Jehovah The steadfastness of his piety
   shines forth in this, that, in the midst of his dangers, he had vowed
   unto God. And now he proves that he by no means forgot these
   engagements, as most men do, who, when the hand of God lies heavy upon
   them, implore his help for a short time, but soon bury in oblivion the
   deliverance which they have received. The Holy Spirit, speaking of the
   true worship of God, very properly connects, by an indissoluble bond,
   these two parts of worship, "Call upon me in the day of trouble;" and,
   "after thy deliverance glorify me," Psalm 50:15. If any regard it as an
   absurdity for the faithful to enter into covenant with God by making
   vows to him, to procure his approbation, my reply is, that they do not
   promise the sacrifice of praise, to soothe him by their flatteries, as
   if he were a mortal like themselves, or to bind him to them by
   proposing some reward, for David had previously protested that he would
   not offer any recompense. The design, then, and the use of vows is,
   first, That the children of God may have their hearts strengthened with
   the confidence of obtaining whatever they ask; and, secondly, That they
   may be stimulated the more to offer up their tribute of gratitude to
   God for his mercies. To aid the children of God in their infirmity, the
   privilege of vowing may surely be conceded to them, for by this means
   their most merciful Father condescends to allow them to enter into
   familiar converse with him, provided they make their vows for the
   object I have stated. Happen what may, nothing must be attempted
   without his permission. And hence the Papists appear the more
   ridiculous, who, under pretext of what is advanced in this place,
   defend all sorts of vows, however foolish and absurd and rashly made;
   as if drunkenness were lawful, because God permits us to eat.

   [381] "C'est, des deliverances." -- Fr. marg. "That is, of
   deliverances."

   [382] That there is here an allusion to the cup of wine drunk in the
   offering of eucharistical sacrifices is very generally admitted by
   commentators. During the feast that followed these sacrifices, the
   master of the family took a cup of wine into his hands, and after
   solemnly giving thanks to God for the mercies experienced, first drank
   of it himself, and then delivered it to all present to be partaken of
   in rotation. "The cup here spoken of by the Psalmist," says Cresswell,
   "was probably used by the master of a Hebrew family at an entertainment
   in his own house, at which the remainder of the victims was eaten,
   after he had offered (Leviticus 7:11, etc.) the sacrifice of a
   peace-offering for a thanksgiving; when, lifting up the cup of wine in
   his hand, he called upon the name of the Lord, giving him thanks. The
   modern Jews are said to use a similar ceremony every year in
   commemoration of the deliverance of their ancestors from the bondage of
   Egypt." Some, indeed, deny that there is any allusion to such
   eucharistical sacrifices, as Hengstenberg, who observes, that this
   communion cup is a mere fiction. In the institution of the festival
   offerings, nothing is indeed said of the cup; but we know from Matthew
   26:29, 30, that in the feast of the Passover, for instance, the
   drinking of a cup of wine and the singing of a hymn were parts of the
   observance. From Jewish tradition we also learn that such was the
   ancient practice. See Lightfoot's Horae Hebraicae on Matthew 26. Our
   Lord, apparently in imitation of the Jewish custom, as the head of the
   family, at the feast of the Passover, "took the cup, and gave thanks,"
   (Luke 22:17.) In allusion to this custom, Paul calls the communion cup
   in the Lord's Supper "the cup of blessing," (1 Corinthians 10:16.) The
   Psalmist, then, here intimates his intention of publicly yielding
   thanks to God for the mercies bestowed upon him. There was a libation
   of wine enjoined by the Mosaic law to be made in the temple every
   morning and evening for a drink-offering, (Numbers 28:7,) to which some
   suppose there is here a reference, observing, that the three last
   verses seem to intimate, that the Psalmist was now at the temple,
   offering the meat-offering, drink-offering, and sacrifices, to the
   Lord.

   Psalm 116:15-19

   15. Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his meek ones. 16.
   Come, O Jehovah! because I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of
   thine handmaid: thou hast broken my fetters. 17. I will sacrifice the
   sacrifices of praise to thee, and call upon the name of Jehovah. [383]
   18. I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people, 19. In
   the courts of the house of Jehovah, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem!
   Praise ye Jehovah.


   15. Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his meek ones. He
   goes on now to the general doctrine of God's providential care for the
   godly, in that he renders them assistance in time of need; their lives
   being precious in his sight. With this shield he desires to defend
   himself from the terrors of death, which often pressed upon him, by
   which he imagined he would instantly be swallowed up. When we are in
   danger and God apparently overlooks us, we then consider ourselves to
   be contemned as poor slaves, and that our life is regarded as a thing
   of nought. And we are aware that when the wicked perceive that we have
   no protection, they wax the more bold against us, as if God took no
   notice either of our life or death. In opposition to their erroneous
   doctrine, David introduces this sentiment, that God does not hold his
   servants in so little estimation as to expose them to death casually.
   [384] We may indeed for a time be subjected to all the vicissitudes of
   fortune and of the world; we will nevertheless always have this
   consolation, that God will, eventually, openly manifest how dear our
   souls are to him. In these times, when innocent blood is shed, and the
   wicked contemners of God furiously exalt themselves, as if exulting
   over a vanquished God, let us hold fast by this doctrine, that the
   death of the faithful, which is so worthless, nay, even ignominious in
   the sight of men, is so valuable in God's sight, that, even after their
   death, he stretches out his hand towards them, and by dreadful examples
   demonstrates how he holds in abhorrence the cruelty of those who
   unjustly persecute the good and simple. If he put their tears in a
   bottle, how will he permit their blood to perish? Psalm 56:8 At his own
   time he will accomplish the prediction of Isaiah, "that the earth shall
   disclose her blood," Isaiah 26:21. To leave room for the grace of God,
   let us put on the spirit of meekness, even as the prophet, in
   designating the faithful meek ones, calls upon them to submit their
   necks quietly to bear the burden of the cross, that in their patience
   they may possess their souls, Luke 21:19

   16 Come, O Jehovah! because I am thy servant. As, in the former verse,
   he gloried that in him God had given an example of the paternal regard
   which he has for the faithful, so here he applies, in an especial
   manner, to himself the general doctrine, by declaring that his fetters
   had been broken, in consequence of his being included among the number
   of God's servants. He employs the term fetters, as if one, with hands
   and feet bound, were dragged by the executioner. In assigning, as the
   reason of his deliverance, that he was God's servant, he by no means
   vaunts of his services, but rather refers to God's unconditional
   election; for we cannot make ourselves his servants, that being an
   honor conferred upon us solely by his adoption. Hence David affirms,
   that he was not God's servant merely, but the son of his handmaid.
   "From the womb of my mother, even before I was born, was this honor
   conferred upon me." He therefore presents himself as a common example
   to all who shall dedicate themselves to the service of God, and place
   themselves under his protection, that they may be under no apprehension
   for their safety while they have him for their defense.

   17. I will sacrifice the sacrifices of praise to thee. He once more
   repeats what he had said about gratitude, and that publicly; for we
   must manifest our piety, not only by our secret affection before God,
   but also by an open profession in the sight of men. David, along with
   the people, observed the rites of the law, knowing that these, at that
   time, were not unmeaning services; but while he did this, he had a
   particular reference to the purpose for which they were appointed, and
   offered principally the sacrifices of praise and the calves of his
   lips. He speaks of the courts of God's house, because at that time
   there was but one altar from which it was unlawful to depart, and it
   was the will of God that the holy assemblies should be held there, that
   the faithful might mutually stimulate one another to the cultivation of
   godliness.

   [383] "This seems to mean the sacrifice prescribed, Leviticus 7:12,

   56:12, perhaps mean only thanksgiving, as Psalm 69:30, certainly doth.
   See verse 31." -- Archbishop Secker.

   [384] "For their death to be precious is, in effect, no more than that
   it is, so considered, rated at so high a price by God, as that he will
   not easily grant it to any one that most desires it of him. Absalom
   here hostilely pursued David and desired his death, he would have been
   highly gratified with it, taking it for the greatest boon that could
   have befallen him: but God would not thus gratify him; nor will he
   grant this desire easily to the enemies of godly men, especially of
   those that commit themselves to his keeping, as David here did." --
   Hammond.

   [374] This psalm is without a title in the Hebrew, although the LXX.
   Have prefixed to it Hallelujah, with which Psalm 115 ends. There have
   been various conjectures among interpreters as to its author. Some
   ascribe it to Hezekiah, and suppose it to relate to his recovery from
   the dangerous sickness recorded in Isaiah 38. Others think that it was
   composed by David upon his deliverance from the rebellion excited by
   his son Absalom, after which he immediately had liberty to return to
   the sanctuary and public assembly at Jerusalem, verses 14, 18, and 19.
   This opinion is confirmed from verse 11, in which he speaks of having
   for a time, under the sad experience of human treachery and deception,
   pronounced all men to be liars; a state of feeling more applicable to
   David's distressed circumstances during the rebellion of his son, than
   to Hezekiah on his recovery from sickness.

   PSALM 117
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 117:1-2

   1. Praise Jehovah, all ye nations; magnify him:, all ye peoples. [385]
   2. Because his mercy is strengthened [386] towards us: and the truth of
   Jehovah remains for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.


   1 Praise Jehovah, all ye nations. The Holy Spirit having, by the mouth
   of the prophet, exhorted all nations to celebrate the praises of God's
   mercy and faithfulness, Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans, very justly
   considers this as a prediction respecting the calling of the whole
   world, (Romans 15:11.) How can unbelievers be qualified for praising
   God, who, though not entirely destitute of his mercy, yet are
   insensible of it, and are ignorant of his truth? It would therefore
   serve no purpose for the prophet to address the heathen nations, unless
   they were to be gathered together in the unity of the faith with the
   children of Abraham. There is no ground for the censorious attempting,
   by their sophistical arguments, to refute the reasoning of Paul. I
   grant that the Holy Spirit elsewhere calls upon the mountains, rivers,
   trees, rain, winds, and thunder, to resound the praises of God, because
   all creation silently proclaims him to be its Maker. It is in a
   different manner that he is praised by his rational creatures. The
   reason assigned is, that God's mercy and truth furnish materials for
   celebrating his praises. Besides, the prophet does not mean that God
   shall be praised everywhere by the Gentiles, because the knowledge of
   his character is confined to a small portion of the land of Judea, but
   because it was to be spread over the whole world. First, he enjoins God
   to be praised, because his goodness is increased, or strengthened, for
   the Hebrew term admits of both meanings. Secondly, because his truth
   remains steadfast for ever How, then, are those qualified to celebrate
   his praises, who, with brutal insensibility, pass over his goodness,
   and shut their ears against his heavenly doctrine?

   The truth of God, in this passage, is properly introduced as an
   attestation of his grace. For he can be true even when he menaces the
   whole world with perdition and ruin. The prophet, however, has placed
   his mercy first in order that his faithfulness and truth, comprising an
   assurance of his paternal kindness, might encourage the hearts of the
   godly. His power and justice are equally praiseworthy; but as men will
   never cordially praise God until they are drawn by a foretaste of his
   goodness, the prophet very justly selects God's mercy and truth, which
   alone open the mouths of those who are mute to engage in this exercise.
   When his truth is said to be everlasting, it is not set in opposition
   to his mercy, as if it, after flourishing for a season, then instantly
   passed away. The same reason would go to prove, that it was small
   compared with his mercy, which is said to be abundant. The meaning is,
   that God's mercy is rich towards us, flowing in a perennial stream,
   because united to his eternal truth. If we read, his mercy is
   confirmed, all difficulty will be removed, for then both constancy and
   stability will alike adorn his mercy and his truth.

   where, parallel to those phrases in St Mark, is no more than panta ta

   for a proof of God's purpose that the Gentiles should be received into
   the Church, and join with the believing Jews in one concert of
   Christian love and faith, and praise God together in the same
   congregation, the proof is brought, as from several other texts, so
   from these words in this psalm. And this not only by expressly citing,

   PSALM 118

   At the time when this psalm was penned, whenever that was, David having
   attained to the possession of royal power, and aware that he reigned
   for the common safety of the Church, calls upon all the children of
   Abraham to ponder attentively this grace. He also recounts his dangers,
   the magnitude and variety of which would have slain him a hundred
   times, had not God wonderfully succored him. From this it is obvious
   that he came to the throne of the kingdom, neither by his own policy,
   nor by the favor of men, nor by any human means. At the same time, he
   informs us that he did not rashly or by wicked intrigues rush forward
   and take forcible possession of the kingdom of Saul, but that he was
   appointed and established king by God himself. Let us remember that it
   was the design of the Spirit, under the figure of this temporal
   kingdom, to describe the eternal and spiritual kingdom of God's Son,
   even as David represented his person. [387]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 118:1-4

   1. Praise ye Jehovah; because he is good: because his mercy endureth
   for ever. 2. Let Israel now [388] say, that his mercy endureth for
   ever. 3. Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
   ever. 4. Let those who fear Jehovah now say, that his mercy endureth
   for ever.


   1 Praise ye Jehovah In this passage we see that David does not merely
   in a private capacity render thanks to God, but that he loudly summons
   the people to engage in the common exercises of piety. This he does,
   not simply from his having been divinely appointed to be the captain
   and teacher of others; but, God having invested him with royal power,
   had manifested his sympathy with his distressed Church. Hence he
   exhorts the Israelites to magnify the grace of God, under whose kind
   protection he appears to re-establish them in safety. In the beginning
   of the psalm he alludes generally to the goodness and mercy of God, but
   he shortly instances himself as an evidence of his goodness, as will be
   seen in its proper place. It becomes us at present to recall to mind
   what I mentioned in the preceding psalm, that a reason for praising God
   is given to us on account of his mercy, in preference to his power or
   justice; because, though his glory shine forth in them also, yet will
   we never promptly and heartily sound forth his praises, until he win us
   by the sweetness of his goodness. Accordingly, in Psalm 51:17, we found
   that the lips of the faithful were opened to praise God, when they
   perceived that he was truly their deliverer. In restricting his address
   to Israel, and to the children of Aaron, he is guided by a regard to
   his own times, because, up to that period, the adoption did not extend
   beyond that one nation. He again resumes the order which he observed in
   Psalm 116:1; for, after exhorting the children of Abraham, who had been
   separated from the Gentiles by the election of God, and also the sons
   of Aaron, who, by virtue of the priesthood, ought to take the
   precedence in conducting the psalmody, he directs his discourse to the
   other worshippers of God; because there were many hypocrites among the
   Israelites, who, occupying a place in the Church, were yet strangers to
   it. This is not inconsistent with David's here speaking by the spirit
   of prophecy, respecting the future kingdom of Christ. That kingdom, no
   doubt, extended to the Gentiles, but its commencement and first-fruits
   were among God's chosen people.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [388] Horsley very properly translates the Hebrew word n', na, in this
   and the two following verses, by O, instead of now: -- "O, Let Israel
   say -- O, Let the house of Aaron say -- O, Let them that fear Jehovah
   say." "The word now," he observes, "in our language is a particle of
   entreaty, and is therefore used by our translators to express the
   supplicatory particle of the Hebrew language, n'. But though now, in
   our language, is indeed a particle of entreaty, it is only when the
   verb is in the imperative mood, and in the second person; as, Do, now,
   grant me this favor;' or, at least, in speaking to the person of whom
   the thing is asked. When n' is joined to a verb in the third person, or
   when the person who is to grant the petition, or perform the thing
   advised, is not immediately addressed, it should be rendered by some
   other word or phrase. By all means,' or of all things,' are equivalent
   phrases, in respect of the sense, but not sufficiently dignified to
   suit the style of sacred poetry. O is perhaps the best particle, in
   these cases, that our language furnishes."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 118:5-9

   5. I called upon God in my distress, and God heard me, by setting me at
   large. 6. Jehovah is with me: I will not fear what man may do unto me.
   7. Jehovah is with me among those who help me, and I shall see my
   desire upon mine enemies. 8. It is better to hope in Jehovah than to
   confide in man: 9. It is better to hope in Jehovah than to confide in
   princes.


   5 I called upon God in my distress. We have here a particular
   application of the doctrine we formerly mentioned, to the person of
   David; with which also is conjoined the rejoicing of the whole Church,
   for whose public welfare God made provision by upholding him. By his
   own example he establishes the faithful, showing them that they ought
   not to faint in the day of adversity. He seems designedly to anticipate
   an objection, which is apt to arise in the minds of men the moment that
   the goodness of God is proclaimed, "Why does he permit his servants to
   be so sore oppressed and afflicted?" David therefore reminds them,
   notwithstanding, that God's mercy never fails, for we have in prayer,
   consolation and an antidote for all our ills. The season, too, in which
   he says that he made supplication, by means of which he obtained
   deliverance, was that of distress, which touches us, that the time of
   sad adversity is most proper for abounding in prayer.

   6 Jehovah is with me among those who help me Confiding solely in God's
   help, he sets at defiance not a few enemies merely, but the whole
   world. "Defended by God's hand, I may boldly and safely set at nought
   all the machinations of men." When all the power of the universe is
   deemed as nothing, in comparison of God, then, indeed, is due honor
   attributed to him. Thus he tacitly reproves the unbelief of almost all
   men, who spontaneously alarm themselves with groundless fears. All,
   indeed, desire peace of mind; but, in consequence of robbing God of the
   praise due to his power, their own ingratitude does not permit them to
   realize this blessing. Were they, as is fitting, to submit in all
   things to the good pleasure and power of God, they would be always
   ready boldly to surmount all those difficulties, the dread of which
   from time to time annoys them. But paying more regard to the
   mischievous attempts of men, than to the help which God can give them,
   they deserve to tremble at the rustling of the falling leaf. It is the
   wish of David, by his own example, to correct such perversity; and,
   with this view, he affirms that, in the enjoyment of God's favor, he
   would fear no man, being fully persuaded that he could rescue him from
   all the nefarious plots which were laid for him. Or if he composed this
   psalm after his deliverance, we see how much he had profited by the
   experience of the grace of God. Therefore, as frequently as God shall
   succor us, let our confidence in him for the future be increased, and
   let us not be unmindful of his goodness and power, which we experienced
   in our extremity. Possibly, he relates the meditations which occurred
   to him in the midst of his distresses; the former conjecture appears
   more probable, that, after he obtained deliverance, he gloried, for the
   future, in God's continued assistance. Some refer the clause, those who
   are helpers with me, to the small troop which David had drawn to him;
   but this, in my opinion, is too refined; for it would tend little to
   the honor of God to class him among the six hundred whom David
   commanded, as if he were one of the troop. My interpretation is more
   simple, that he calls God his helper. "It is enough for me that God is
   on my side." Were he deprived of all human aid, still he would have no
   hesitation in opposing God against all his enemies.

   8 It is better to trust in Jehovah He appears to state nothing but what
   is common-place, it being unanimously admitted, that when God and men
   come into comparison, he must be viewed as infinitely exalted above
   them, and therefore it is best to trust in him for the aid which he has
   promised to his own people. All make this acknowledgment, and yet there
   is scarcely one among a hundred who is fully persuaded that God alone
   can afford him sufficient help. That man has attained a high rank among
   the faithful, who, resting satisfied in God, never ceases to entertain
   a lively hope, even when he finds no help upon earth. The comparison,
   however, is improper, inasmuch as we are not allowed to transfer to men
   even the smallest portion of our confidence, which must be placed in
   God alone. The meaning is by no means ambiguous; the Psalmist is
   ridiculing the illusory hopes of men by which they are tossed hither
   and thither; and declares, that when the world smiles upon them they
   wax proud, and either forsake God or despise him. Some are of opinion
   that David bitterly reproaches his enemies with their being deceived in
   depending upon the favor of Saul. This appears to me to be too limited
   a view of the passage; and I question not that David here proposes
   himself as an example to all the faithful; in that he had reaped the
   full fruit of his hope, when, depending solely upon God, he had
   patiently borne the loss of all earthly succor. In the 9th verse, in
   which he substitutes princes for men, there is an extension of the
   idea. "Not only those who put their confidence in men of low degree act
   foolishly, but also, those who confide even in the greatest potentates;
   for the trust that is put in flesh shall at last be accursed, but the
   enjoyment of God's favor will convert even death itself into life."

   Psalm 118:10-14

   10. All nations compassed me: but in the name of Jehovah I will surely
   cut them off. 11. They compassed me; yea, they compassed me: in
   Jehovah's name I will surely cut them off. 12. They compassed me as
   bees: they are quenched [389] as a fire of thorns: in Jehovah's name I
   will surely cut them off. 13. Thrusting, thou hast thrust at me, that I
   might fall: [390] but Jehovah helped me. 14. God is my strength and
   song, and he hath saved me.


   10. All nations compassed me In these verses he relates the wonderful
   deliverance which he had received, that all might know that it was not
   of human but divine origin. Once and again he declares, that he was
   compassed not by a few persons, but by a vast multitude. The people,
   being all inflamed with anger and fury against him, compassed him so
   that there were no means for his escape, and he could procure help from
   no quarter but from heaven. Some consider his complaint, that all
   nations were adverse to him, as referring to the neighboring nations,
   by whom we know David was surrounded with danger. His meaning, in my
   opinion, is, that the whole world was adverse to him; because he places
   God's help alone in opposition to the deadly and furious hatred both of
   his own countrymen and of the neighboring nations towards him, so that
   there was not a spot upon the earth where he could be safe. There was,
   it is true, no army, collected from several nations, besieging him;
   still he had no peaceable retreat except among the haunts of wild
   beasts, from which also he was driven by terror. And in proportion to
   the number of persons he encountered were the snares laid to entrap
   him. It is, therefore, not wonderful that he said he was compassed by
   all nations. Besides, this elliptical mode of speaking is more forcible
   than if he had merely said that he trusted in God, by reason of which
   he had become victorious. By publicly mentioning the name of God alone,
   he maintains that no other means of deliverance were within his reach,
   and that but for his interposition he must have perished. It appears to
   me preferable to translate the particle ky, ki, affirmatively. [391]
   "Besieged as I am on all sides by the world, yet if the power of God
   help me, that will be more than adequate for the extermination of all
   mine enemies." Their obstinate and implacable hatred is pointed out by
   him in the repetition of the phrase compassed about, and their
   outrageous fury is set forth in comparing them to bees, which, though
   not possessed of much strength, are very fierce, and when in their
   insensate fury they attack a person, they occasion no little fear. He
   shortly adds, they are quenched as a fire of thorns, which at first
   makes a great crackling, and throws out a greater flame than a fire of
   wood, but soon passes away. The amount is, that David's enemies had
   furiously assailed him, but that their fury soon subsided. Hence he
   again repeats, that sustained by the power of God, whatever opposition
   might rise against him would soon pass away.

   13. Thou hast sorely thrust at me. He either now changes the person, or
   directs his discourse to Saul, his principal enemy. In the person of
   one, he sets at defiance all his enemies together. In saying that he
   had been thrust at, he admits that he did not withstand the onset by
   his own bravery, as those who are powerful enough to encounter
   opposition, sustain the assaults of their enemies without flinching.
   The power of God is more illustriously displayed in raising him up even
   from ruin itself.

   In the subsequent verse he draws the conclusion that God is his
   strength and song. By the former adjunct he candidly acknowledges his
   weakness, and ascribes his safety exclusively to God. And having
   admitted that his strength was in God alone, because he was sustained
   by his power, immediately he adds, that God is his praise or his song,
   which must be understood passively. "In myself there was no ground for
   boasting, to God belongs entirely all the praise of my safety." The
   last clause of the verse, in which he says that God was his salvation,
   refers to the same subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [389] The verb dkv, doachu, here used has ordinarily the signification
   of to quench. But in this text it is rendered in all the old versions
   in the sense of to burn. "This makes it probable," says Hammond, "that
   as many other words in the Hebrew language are used in contrary senses,
   so dk, which signifies in other places passively to be consumed, or
   extinguished, may signify here as an enantiosemon to flame, or in an
   active sense, as in Arabic it is used, violently to break in or set
   upon, as in war or contention when men violently rush one on another."
   And this seems most suitable to the connection in which it stands. At
   first sight one would think it strange to say that the adversaries of
   David were quenched (i.e., destroyed) as the fire of thorns; and for
   the Psalmist afterwards to state, In the name of the Lord I will surely
   cut them off. If the verb is here interpreted in the sense of to burn,
   the main object of the metaphor must be to express, by a figure
   frequently employed in Scripture, the impotence and quick termination
   of the rage of those men, however fierce and apparently formidable. It
   would soon expend itself, and their power of doing injury be lost like
   a fire of thorns, which, although for a moment it makes a great
   crackling, and rages violently as if it would quickly consume every
   thing near, soon ceases, and nothing remains but the ashes. If the verb
   is understood in the sense of to quench, the language is very
   elliptical, and in the true genius of Hebrew poetry, which frequently
   couches in a few words such images as in the hands of Homer would be
   materials for an enlarged and dignified description, while it leaves
   unexpressed more than half of what is intended to be understood. The
   sudden quenching of the hostile army, like the extinction of a fire of
   thorns, implies the previous comparison of such array to a fire. "It is
   remarkable that, in a similar connection, Homer has such a comparison
   of an hostile army to fire, in which he expresses what David left to be
   understood, and omits (for he had no occasion to introduce) what David
   expresses, namely, the sudden quenching of the fire: -- As when
   devouring flames some forest seize
   On the high mountains, splendid from afar
   The blaze appears, so, moving in the plain,
   The steel-clad host innum'rous flash'd to heav'n.'
   Iliad 2, 516. Cowper." -- Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible.

   [390] Hammond reads, "Thou hast thrust sore at me to ruin or filling."
   "The full import of lnphl," says he, "is best expressed gerundially, ad
   cadendum, to falling, not only to express their desire who thus pressed
   and thrust at him, that he might fall, for that is supposed in the
   violence of their impulsion, expressed by repetition of the verb
   dchytny dchh, thou hast by thrusting thrust me, but to signify the
   event or success of it, that I was falling, or ready to fall. Tou
   pesein, say the LXX. in the infinitive mood gerundially, and so the
   Chaldee and the Syriac; and so the Jewish Arab, It is a long while that
   thou hast driven or thrust me to falling.' And this expresses the
   greatness and seasonableness of the deliverance, that when he was
   falling, God helped him."

   [391] "I take ky to be an affirmative adverb, surely, and not a
   conjunction." -- Lowth.

   Psalm 118:15-21

   15. The voice of shouting and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
   just: the right hand of Jehovah hath done valiantly. 16. The right hand
   of Jehovah is exalted, the right hand of Jehovah hath done valiantly.
   17. I shall not die, yea, I shall live, and speak of the works of God.
   18. God chastising has chastised me; but he did not deliver me unto
   death. 19. Open to me the gates of righteousness; and having entered
   into them, I will praise God. 20. This is the gate of Jehovah, the just
   shall enter into it. 21. I will praise thee, because thou hast heard
   me, and hast been my salvation.


   15. The voice of shouting and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
   just. He affirms that the kindness which God had conferred upon him was
   so extensive, that it would not do to render thanks to him privately.
   In the benefits which he had received, God's power appeared both
   remarkable and memorable, and the fruit of it also was extended to the
   whole Church. Therefore, as David's deliverance was wonderful and
   advantageous generally to all the godly, he promises that he would make
   a public thanksgiving; and invites them to join him in this holy
   exercise. By this circumstance, he chiefly aims at magnifying the grace
   of God, and also by its effects to demonstrate, that not merely his
   individual preservation, but that of the whole Church, in his person,
   was accomplished. Intercommunion among believers does, indeed, bind
   them alternately to render thanks to God for each other; in David's
   case, there was the specific reason which I have mentioned, his
   wonderful preservation from many deaths, and his having assigned to him
   the sovereignty of God's chosen people. It is worthy of notice, that he
   combines the voice of joy and gladness with the praise of God, by which
   he shows that believers ought to mingle with their mirth a sense of the
   grace of God. To do valiantly, is tantamount to a magnificent display
   of his power, so that there may be a bright manifestation of its
   effulgence. God ofttimes secretly, and when apparently feeble, grants
   deliverance to his faithful people, that they may be sensible that it
   comes from him; but this is not so well known to others. Here, however,
   David asserts that the operation of God was so plainly developed, no
   one could doubt whence his safety came. The other phrase, that the
   right hand of God was exalted, refers to the same subject, because, by
   working powerfully and unwontedly, God had exalted his hand.

   17. I shall not die David speaks like one emerging from the sepulcher.
   The very same person who says, I shall not die, acknowledges that he
   was rescued from death, to which he was near as one condemned to it.
   For a series of years his life was in imminent danger, exposed every
   moment to a thousand deaths, and no sooner was he delivered from one
   than he entered into another. Thus he declares that he would not die,
   because he regained life, all hope of which he had entirely abandoned.
   We, whose life is hid with Christ in God, ought to mediate upon this
   song all our days, Colossians 3:3. If we occasionally enjoy some
   relaxation, we are bound to unite with David in saying, that we who
   were surrounded with death are risen to newness of life. In the
   meantime, we must constantly persevere through the midst of darkness:
   as our safety lies in hope, it is impossible that it can be very
   visible to us. In the second member of the verse, he points out the
   proper use of life. God does not prolong the lives of his people, that
   they may pamper themselves with meat and drink, sleep as much as they
   please, and enjoy every temporal blessing, but to magnify him for his
   benefits which he is daily heaping upon them. Of this subject we have
   spoken on [22]Psalm 115

   18. In chastising God has chastised me. In these words David owns that
   his enemies assailed him unjustly, that they were employed by God to
   correct him, that this was fatherly chastisement, God not inflicting a
   deadly wound, but correcting him in measure and in mercy. He seems to
   anticipate the perverse decisions of perverse men which grievously
   pressed upon him, as if all the ills which he had endured were so many
   evidences of his being cast off by God. These calumnies which the
   reprobate cast upon him he applies very differently, by declaring that
   his correction was mild and paternal. The main thing in adversity is to
   know that we are laid low by the hand of God, and that this is the way
   which he takes to prove our allegiance, to arouse us from our
   torpidity, to crucify our old man, to purge us from our filthiness, to
   bring us into submission and subjection to God, and to excite us to
   meditate on the heavenly life.

   If these things were recollected by us, there is not one of us who
   would not shudder at the thought of fretting against God, but would
   much rather yield submission to him with a mild and meek spirit. Our
   champing the bit, and rushing forward impatiently, certainly proceeds
   from the majority of men not looking upon their afflictions as God's
   rods, and from others not participating in his paternal care. The last
   clause of the verse, therefore, merits particular attention, That God
   always deals mercifully with his own people, so that his correction
   proves their cure. Not that his paternal regard is always visible, but
   that in the end it will be shown that his chastisements, so far from
   being deadly, serve the purpose of a medicine, which, though it produce
   a temporary debility, rids us of our malady, and renders us healthy and
   vigorous.

   19 Open unto me the gates of righteousness [392] Under the influence of
   ardent zeal, David here sets himself to testify his gratitude,
   commanding the temple to be opened to him, as if the oblations were all
   already prepared. He now confirms what he said formerly, That he would
   render thanks to God publicly in the properly constituted assembly of
   the faithful. It was the practice of the priests to open the doors of
   the temple to the people; it appears, however, that David here alludes
   to his long exile, which supposition is corroborated by the following
   verse. Having been for a long period prevented from having access to
   the sanctuary, and even from coming within sight of it, he now rejoices
   and exults at being again admitted to offer sacrifice unto God. And he
   declares that he will not approach as the hypocrites were wont to do,
   whom God, by the prophet Isaiah, reproaches with treading his courts in
   vain, but that he will come with the sacrifice of praise, (Isaiah 1:12)
   Fully persuaded that he drew near in the spirit of genuine devotion, he
   says it is proper that the doors of the temple, which lately he durst
   not enter, should be opened to him and such as he. It is, says he, the
   gate of Jehovah, and, therefore, he will open it for the just. The
   meaning is, that banished as David had been from the temple and from
   his country, now that the kingdom is in a better condition, both he and
   all the true worshippers of God regained their right to approach his
   sanctuary. Thus he indirectly mourns over the profanation of the
   temple, in that, while under the tyranny of Saul, it was occupied by
   the profane contemners of God, as if it had been a kennel for dogs and
   other unclean animals. This abomination, the temple being for a long
   time a den of thieves, is here inveighed against; but now that it is
   patent to the righteous, he declares it to be God's holy house. What
   occurred in the days of Saul is visible in these days, God's bitter
   enemies most wickedly and shamefully occupying his sanctuary. The Pope
   would not be Antichrist if he did not sit in the temple of God, (2
   Thessalonians 2:4). Having, by his vile pollutions, converted all
   temples into brothels, let us endeavor as much as we can to purge them,
   and prepare them for the pure worship of God. And as it has pleased Him
   to choose his holy habitation among us, let us exert ourselves to
   remove all the defilements and abominations which disfigure the purity
   of the Church. David then relates briefly the reason of his offering
   the sacrifice of praise to God, namely, that he had been preserved by
   his grace.

   Psalm 118:22-26

   22. The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the
   corner. [393] 23. This was done by Jehovah; it is marvelous in our
   eyes. 24. This is the day which Jehovah made; let us rejoice and be
   glad in it. 25. I beseech thee, O Jehovah! save me; I beseech thee, I
   beseech thee, O Jehovah! give prosperity, I beseech thee. 26. Blessed
   is he who cometh in the name of Jehovah: we bless you out of the house
   of Jehovah.


   22 The stone which the builders rejected In these words David boldly
   pours contempt on the calumnies with which he was unjustly and
   undeservedly assailed. As there was something ominous in his being
   condemned by the entire assemblage of the nobles, and all those who
   were invested with authority, and as the opinion was prevalent, that he
   was a wicked and rejected man; this error he deliberately refutes, and
   vindicates his innocence in the face of the principal men among them.
   "It is of little importance to me that I am abandoned by the chief men,
   seeing I have been visibly chosen by the judgment of God to be king
   over Israel." The similitude which he employs is appropriate, comparing
   himself to a stone, and the principal rulers of the Church to
   master-builders It might, indeed, appear most irrational on his part to
   assert that the heads of the realm, to whom the government of the
   Church was intrusted, should be deprived of the Spirit of God, and
   divested of a sound judgment. Hence, in opposition to their perverse
   and erroneous judgment, he places the grace of God, declaring that he
   was placed by the purpose and power of God to sustain the whole
   building. In a word, he shows that splendid titles and high rank, in
   which his enemies glory, are no obstruction to him, because, relying
   upon the call of God, he possesses a glory superior to the verdict of
   the whole world. It being a difficult matter to persuade them of the
   truth of this, he magnifies and enlarges upon the grace of God, in
   order that its authority might suppress all evil speaking and clamorous
   surmises.

   This, says he, is the doing of Jehovah "Go and quarrel with God, all ye
   that strenuously endeavor to eject me from my throne, to which I have
   not been elevated accidentally, or by human policy, but by the manifest
   power of God." This he confirms by all being constrained to wonder at
   what had occurred as a thing incredible. Now, when God doeth
   marvellously, and in a manner that surpasses our comprehension, his
   power cannot fail to be so much the more apparent unto us. Should any
   prefer to interpret it thus:-Although this work may fill men with
   astonishment, yet that is no reason for rejecting it; he may do so. To
   me, however, it certainly appears more probable that David employs the
   term wonderful, that the haughtiness of man may submit to God, and that
   none may presume to breathe a whisper against him. The fitness of these
   things being applied to Christ will be more properly discussed when I
   come to consider the twenty-fifth verse.

   24. This is the day which Jehovah made He now speaks of that as a happy
   and pleasant day, on which he was at last established king over Israel,
   and the anointing of him by Samuel ratified by this event. Doubtless,
   all days were created alike by God, nevertheless David, by way of
   eminence, calls that the day of God which, after a long period of
   darkness, had dawned for the weal of the Church, because it was
   signalized by a notable event, deserving of being remembered by
   succeeding generations; and because the Church had thus emerged from a
   state of deep obscurity, he exhorts the faithful to mirth and joy, and
   that, too, by reason of the ignorance which many still displayed of the
   grace of God, or of their treating it with contempt, and of others
   being so lettered by their perverse attachment to Saul, that they could
   scarcely be brought to yield allegiance to David.

   25 I beseech thee, O Jehovah! save me As the term n', na, in Hebrew is
   frequently used as an adverb of time, not a few render it, in this
   place, now: Save, I beseech thee, now. It is also often used in the
   form of asking, and this is the meaning I attach to it, and which
   accords very well with this passage; for I am persuaded that the Holy
   Spirit, in repeating the same phrase, designed, by the mouth of the
   prophet, to stir up and stimulate the faithful to great earnestness and
   ardor in prayer. If any prefer a different interpretation, it will not
   be difficult to prevail on me to agree to it. One thing is plain, that
   there is here a form of prayer prescribed to the chosen people, to seek
   for prosperity to the kingdom of David, upon which the common safety of
   all depended. In these words, too, he protested that he held his
   kingdom by Divine legation, and, therefore, they who would not agree to
   wish prosperity to his reign were unworthy of occupying a place in the
   Church.

   In the verse following, a particular request is subjoined, which the
   faithful must entertain; namely, that as God had thus appointed David
   to be the minister of his grace, so he would also bless him Those are
   said to come in the name of the Lord, whom God employs for the welfare
   of his Church -- such as prophets and teachers, whom he raises up to
   gather together his Church; and generals and governors, whom he
   instructs by his Spirit. But as David was a type of Christ, his case
   was peculiar; it being the will of God that his people should dwell
   under him and his successors till the advent of Christ. The clause,
   blessed is he that cometh, may be viewed as a form of congratulation;
   but seeing that the benediction of the priests is immediately annexed,
   I am disposed rather to believe that the people wished for David God's
   grace and favor. To induce them to present this petition with more
   alacrity, and thus be encouraged to receive the king whom God appointed
   them, this promise is added in the person of the priests, We bless you
   out of the house of the Lord.

   They speak in this manner agreeably with the nature of their office,
   which enjoined on them the duty of blessing the people, as appears from
   several passages in the books of Moses, and particularly from Numbers
   6:23. It is not without reason that they connect the welfare of the
   Church with the prosperity of the kingdom, it being their desire to
   throw out the suggestion, and to represent that the safety of the
   people would remain as long as that kingdom continued to flourish, and
   that they would all share in the blessings which would be conferred
   upon their king, because of the indissoluble connection which exists
   between the head and members. Knowing, as we now do, that when David
   was constituted king, the foundation of that everlasting kingdom, which
   was eventually manifested in the advent of Christ, was then laid, and
   that the temporal throne upon which the descendants of David were
   placed was a type of the eternal kingdom given to Christ by God his
   Father, in consequence of which he obtained all power, both in heaven
   and on earth, there can be no question that the prophet calls upon the
   faithful to pray fervently and constantly for the prosperity and
   progress of this spiritual kingdom; for it was incumbent on those who
   lived during the shadowy dispensation to pray for David and his
   successors; but after all the grandeur of that kingdom was overthrown,
   it behooved them to entreat the more ardently that God, in fulfillment
   of his promise, would re-establish it. In short, all that is here
   stated properly relates to the person of Christ; and that which was
   dimly adumbrated in David was brightly represented and fulfilled in
   Christ. The election of David was secret; and after he was anointed by
   Samuel to be king, he was rejected by Saul, and by all the heads of the
   people, and all abhorred him as if he had been a person deserving of a
   hundred deaths. Thus disfigured and dishonored, he did not appear to be
   a fit stone for occupying a place in the building. Similar to this was
   the beginning of the kingdom of Christ, who, being sent by his Father
   for the redemption of the Church, not only was despised by the world,
   but also hated and execrated, both by the common people and the
   dignitaries of the Church.

   But it may be asked, how the prophet designates those master-builders
   who, so far from wishing the protection of the Church, aim at nothing
   so much as the demolition of the entire structure? We know, for
   instance, with what vehemence the scribes and priests, in Christ's
   time, labored to subvert all true piety. The reply is not difficult.
   David refers solely to the office which they held, and not to the
   inclinations by which they were actuated. Saul and all his counsellors
   were subverters of the Church, and yet, in relation to their office,
   they were chief-builders. To the ungodly the Holy Ghost is wont to
   concede the honorable titles which belong to their office, until that
   God remove them from it. How abandoned, oftentimes, were the priests
   among the ancient people of God, and yet they retained the dignity and
   honor which belonged to their office, until they were denuded of it.
   Hence the words of Isaiah,

   "Who is blind, but my servant; and who is foolish., but he whom I have
   sent?" Isaiah 42:19

   Now, though their intention was to undermine the whole constitution of
   the Church, yet, as they were divinely called for a different object,
   he calls them the servants and the sent of God. In our day, also, the
   Pope and his filthy clergy, who usurp the title of the priesthood,
   nevertheless continue the professed enemies of Christ; from which it
   follows, that they are any thing rather than God's legitimate servants,
   -and occupying the position of pastors -- while they scatter the flock,
   their condemnation will be the greater. Between them and the Levitical
   priests there is assuredly a wide difference. As, however, they are
   invested with the usual authority, there can be no harm in conceding
   the title to them, provided they do not use it as a cloak to conceal
   their vile tyranny; for if the mere title was sufficient to procure for
   them personal reverence, then Christ must, of necessity, have been
   silenced, seeing that the priests rejected his doctrine. This passage
   rather informs us, that those who are intrusted with the office of
   ruling the Church, sometime, prove the worst workmen. David, speaking
   by the Spirit, denominates chief-builders those who attempted to
   destroy the Son of God and the salvation of mankind, and by whom the
   worship of God was adulterated, religion wholly corrupted, and the
   temple of God profaned. If, therefore, all who are clothed with the
   ordinary authority must be listened to without exception, as legally
   appointed pastors, then must Christ not speak, because it very
   frequently occurs, that his bitterest enemies are concealed under the
   garb of pastors.

   Here we behold with how strong and impregnable a shield the Holy Ghost
   furnishes us against the empty vauntings of the Papal clergy. Be it so,
   that they possess the name, "chief-builders;" but if they disown
   Christ, does it necessarily follow that we must disown him also? Let us
   rather contemn and trample under our feet all their decrees, and let us
   reverence this precious stone upon which our salvation rests. By the
   expression, is become the head of the corner, we are to understand the
   real foundation of the Church, which sustains the whole weight of the
   edifice; it being requisite that the corners should form the main
   strength of buildings. I do not approve of the ingenious opinion of
   Augustine, who makes Christ the corner-stone, because he united both
   Jews and Gentiles, thus making the corner the middle stone between the
   two different walls.

   David then proceeds to repeat, at some length, as I have observed, that
   it is erroneous to estimate the kingdom of Christ by the sentiments and
   opinions of men, because, in spite of the opposition of the world, it
   is erected in an astonishing manner by the invisible power of God. In
   the meantime, we ought to remember, that all that was accomplished in
   the person of Christ extends to the gradual development of his kingdom,
   even until the end of the world. When Christ dwelt on the earth, he was
   despised by the chief priests; and now, those who call themselves the
   successors of Peter and Paul, but who are truly Ananiases and
   Caiaphases, giant-like wage war against the Gospel and the Holy Ghost.
   Not that this furious rebellion ought to give us any uneasiness: let us
   rather humbly adore that wonderful power of God which reverses the
   perverse decisions of the world. If our limited understandings could
   comprehend the course which God follows for the protection and
   preservation of his Church, there would be no mention made of a
   miracle. From this we conclude, that his mode of working is
   incomprehensible, baffling the understandings of men.

   Was it necessary, it may be asked, that Christ should be reproached by
   the master-builders? It would certainly indicate a sad state of the
   Church, if she never had any pastors except those who were deadly
   enemies to her welfare. When Paul styles himself "a master-builder," he
   informs us that this office was common to all the apostles, (1
   Corinthians 3:10). My answer therefore is, that all who bear rule in
   the Church are not charged with perpetual blindness; but that the Holy
   Spirit meets with this stumblingblock, which, in other respects, is
   wont to prove a hindrance to many when they witness the name of Christ
   enveloped with worldly splendor. When God, for the purpose of making
   his glory shine forth more brightly, looseth Satan's rein, so that
   those who are invested with power and authority reject Christ, then it
   is that the Holy Spirit bids us be of good courage, and setting at
   nought all these perverse decisions, receive with all respect the King
   whom God has placed over us. From the first, we know that the
   master-builders have endeavored to subvert the kingdom of Christ. The
   same thing is taking place in our times, in those who are intrusted
   with the superintendence of the Church having made every attempt to
   overturn that kingdom, by directing against it all the machinery which
   they can devise. But if we call to mind this prophecy, our faith will
   not fail, but will be more and more confirmed; because, from these
   things it will the better appear that the kingdom of Christ does not
   depend upon the favor of men, and that it does not derive its strength
   from earthly supports, even as he has not attained it by the suffrages
   of men. If, however, the master-builders build well, the perverseness
   of those who will not permit themselves to be appropriated to the
   sacred edifice will be so much the less excusable. Moreover, as often
   as we shall, by this species of temptation, be put to the trial, let us
   not forget that it is unreasonable to expect that the Church must be
   governed according to our understanding of matters, but that we are
   ignorant of the government of it, inasmuch as that which is miraculous
   surpasses our comprehension.

   The next clause, this is the day that God hath made, reminds us that
   there will be nothing but the reign of moral darkness, until Christ the
   Sun of Righteousness illumine us by his gospel. We are also reminded
   that this work is to be ascribed to God, and that mankind must not
   arrogate to themselves any merit on account of their own endeavors. The
   call to the exercise of gratitude, which immediately follows, is
   intended to warn us against yielding to the madness of our enemies,
   however furiously they rage against us, in order to deprive us of the
   joy which Christ has brought to us. From him all our happiness is
   derived, and, consequently, there is no cause for surprise that all the
   ungodly fume with vexation, and feel indignant, that we should be
   elevated to such a pitch of joy as to suppress all the sorrows and
   soothe all the asperity of the trials we have to endure. Prior to the
   advent of Christ, the prayer that follows was familiar to the people,
   and even to the children, for the Evangelists declare that Christ was
   received with this form of salutation. And certainly it was the will of
   God to ratify, at that time, the prediction which he had spoken by the
   mouth of David; or rather that exclamation clearly demonstrates that
   the interpretation, against which the Jews now raise a clamor, was
   unanimously admitted; and this renders their obstinacy and malice the
   more inexcusable. I blame them not for their stupidity, seeing that
   they purposely spread around them the mists of ignorance to blind
   themselves and others. And as the Jews never ceased to put up this
   prayer during that sad desolation, and those hideous devastations,
   their perseverance ought to inspire us with new vigor in these days. At
   that time they had not the honor of a kingdom, no royal throne, no name
   but with God; and yet amid this deplorable and ruinous state of things,
   they adhered to the form of prayer formerly prescribed to them by the
   Holy Spirit. Instructed by their example, let us not fail to pray
   ardently for the restoration of the Church, which, in our day, is
   involved in sad desolation. Besides, in these words, we are also
   informed that Christ's kingdom is not upheld and advanced by the policy
   of men, but that this is the work of God alone, for in his blessing
   solely the faithful are taught to confide. Moreover, the very
   repetition of the words which, as we have observed, renders them more
   forcible, ought to arouse us from our lethargy, and render us more
   intensely ardent in breathing forth this prayer. God can, indeed, of
   himself, and independently of the prayer of any one, erect and protect
   the kingdom of his Son; but it is not without good cause that he has
   laid this obligation on us, as there is no duty more becoming the
   faithful than that of earnestly seeking for the advancement of his
   glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [393] The learned Michaelis understands this literally. "It appears,"
   says he, "that, probably at the building of Solomon's temple, one of
   those stones, which David had taken care to get provided and made ready
   for use, was found faith with by the builders, and declared to be
   useless, and that God, for altogether different reasons, commanded by a
   prophet that this stone should be made the corner-stone. The Orientals
   regard the corner-stone as the one peculiarly holy stone in a temple,
   and that it confers sanctity upon the whole edifice. It is, therefore,
   the more probable that, either by the Urim and Thummim, (the sacred lot
   of the Jews,) or by a prophet, God was consulted which stone he would
   direct to be taken for the corner-stone. The answer was, that which
   they have perseveringly rejected, and declared to be quite
   unserviceable. Certainly it must have been for a very important reason,
   that God positively appointed this stone to be the corner-stone. But
   the New Testament declares it to us in Matthew 21:42; Acts 4:11; and 1
   Peter 2:7. The Jewish nation would conduct themselves towards the
   Messiah precisely as the builders did towards this stone, and would
   reject him; but God would select him to be the corner-stone, which
   should support and sanctify the whole Church." -- Quoted in Dr Pye
   Smith on the Priesthood of Christ, page 150. Michaelis' opinion, that
   the words literally relate to a stone which the builders at first
   rejected, but which they were subsequently induced to place in the most
   important part of the building, is, however, mere conjecture. The
   prophetic sense in which this verse is applicable to the Messiah, who
   was rejected by the chief priests, elders, and Pharisees of his time,
   and who is now the foundation of an ample and constantly increasing
   Church, rests on more solid grounds; being sanctioned both by Christ
   himself and his apostles. The head stone of the corner does not mean
   the top stone, but the chief stone of the foundation, answering to what
   we call the first stone. -- See Ephesians 2:20, 21; 1 Peter 2:4, 5.

   Psalm 118:27-29

   27. Jehovah is God, and has given light to us: bind ye the lamb with
   cords, even to the horns of the altar. [394] 28. Thou art my God, and I
   will praise thee: my God, I will exalt thee. 29. Praise ye Jehovah;
   because he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.


   27. Jehovah is God Here the prophet establishes what he said formerly,
   that God, out of compassion to his Church, dissipated the darkness, and
   introduced the light of his grace, when David mounted the throne, for
   that was the harbinger of the redemption which was anticipated to be
   effected in due time by Christ. He also asserts that God was the author
   of that deliverance, so wonderful and unlooked for, and he declares
   that, by the result, he plainly showed himself to be truly God. These
   words, Jehovah himself is a strong God, because he has restored the
   light of life to us, are tacitly emphatical. For as the faithful, in
   consequence of the confused state of the Church, were reduced almost to
   the brink of despair; the ungodly imagined that all this had happened
   regarding the children of Abraham, by reason of God himself having, as
   it were, forsaken them. Wherefore he returns to offer up anew his
   thankful acknowledgments for the divine grace. He commands the faithful
   to bind the victim to the horns of the altar, because, according to the
   legal institute, they could not render solemn thanks unto God without
   sacrifices. As David was a strict observer of the Law, he would not
   omit the ceremonial observances which God had enjoined. He would,
   however, always keep his attention steadily fixed on their grand
   design, and would have recourse to them only as helps to assist him in
   presenting a spiritual service unto God. Now that the shadowy
   dispensation has passed away, it remains that we offer unto God our
   thanksgivings through Christ, who sanctifies them by his own immaculate
   offering, lest we should be debarred from this exercise of godliness,
   by the corruptions of our flesh. And that David turned his attention to
   the praises of God, is abundantly manifest from the following verse, in
   which he promises that he would celebrate the name of God, because he
   was his God, and he knew it; that is, he felt from experience that from
   his hand he might calculate on receiving sure and immediate assistance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [394] "Yea even unto the horns of the altar -- before these words must
   be understood lead it: for the victims were bound to rings fixed in the
   floor. The horns were architectural ornaments, a kind of capitals, made
   of iron or of brass, somewhat in the form of the carved horns of an
   animal, projecting from the four angles of the altar. The officiating
   priest, when he prayed, placed his hands on them, and sometimes
   sprinkled them with the blood of the sacrifice: comp. Exodus 30:3;
   Leviticus 4:7, 18. At the end of this verse, the word saying must be
   supplied." -- Cresswell.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [387] Calvin ascribes this psalm to David; but, as it is without any
   title, it is uncertain who was its author. On this point, and the
   occasion of its composition, various opinions prevail among
   commentators. According to Hengstenberg, it celebrates the return of
   the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, and the laying the foundation
   of the second temple; in support of which he refers to Ezra 3:11.
   Phillips thinks it "probable that it was written for the occasion when
   David was to be anointed at Hebron king over the tribes of Israel, (2
   Samuel 5;) for, previously to his inauguration, he was subjected to
   many dangers, both from avowed foes, as well as from Saul and his
   party. He was exposed to the hostility of the Philistines (1 Samuel
   29,) and the Amalekites, (1 Samuel 30;) from the former he escaped in
   safety, and the latter he overcame in battle. Again, although he had
   been long chosen king of Israel by God, for a considerable period he
   was exposed to a severe persecution; he was obliged to flee for safety
   from his country, and it was not till after the death of Saul that his
   troubles ceased, and he ascended the throne, which had long been his by
   Divine appointment. To David, therefore, at Hebron, this psalm will
   apply; for he could then say, All nations compassed me about. The Lord
   hath chastised me, but he hath not given me over unto death. The stone
   which the builders refused is become the head-stone of the corner. This
   is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.'" Some assign it to
   the time of Hezekiah; and others to that period of Israel's history,
   which is adorned by the illustrious achievements of the Maccabees. "I
   shall not presume," says Walford, "to decide which of these opinions is
   the most agreeable to truth. It will be more to our purpose to observe,
   that the psalm was read on occasion of a solemn procession that was
   formed by the king or chief magistrate, whoever he might be, the
   priests and the people at large, of all ranks, in order to perform
   public sacrifices of thanksgiving at the temple."

   PSALM 119

   As this psalm treats of various matters, it is difficult to give an
   epitome of its contents. There are, however, two things which the
   prophet mainly aims at; the exhorting of the children of God to follow
   godliness and a holy life; and the prescribing of the rule, and
   pointing out the form of the true worship of God, so that the faithful
   may devote themselves wholly to the study of the Law. Along with these
   he frequently blends promises for the purpose of animating the
   worshippers of God to live more justly and piously; and, at the same
   time, he introduces complaints respecting the impious contempt of the
   Law, lest they should become tainted by bad examples. In short, he
   frequently passes from one topic to another, and prosecutes no one
   particular subject continuously; [395] and therefore it will be best to
   discuss each subject in its proper place.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 119:1-8

   ' 1. Blessed are they who are upright, [396] in their way, walking in
   the law of Jehovah. ' 2. Blessed are they who, keeping his testimonies,
   seek him with all their heart. ' 3. Surely they do not work iniquity,
   who walk in his ways. ' 4. Thou hast commanded that thy statutes should
   be observed carefully [397] ' 5. I wish that my ways may be directed to
   the observing of thy statutes! ' 6. Then I shall not be ashamed, when I
   have respect to all thy precepts. ' 7. I will praise thee in the
   uprightness of my heart, when I shall have learned the judgments of thy
   righteousness. ' 8. I will observe thy statutes: do not forsake me very
   far. [398]


   Some call this the octonary psalm, because that, through every
   successive eight verses, the initial words of each line begin with the
   same letter in alphabetical order. That this was done to aid the
   memory, may be gathered from each part containing a doctrine, which
   ought to form a theme of constant meditation among the children of God.
   For the purpose, therefore, of rendering it less irksome to the reader,
   the prophet has distinguished every successive eight verses by their
   beginning each with the corresponding letter of the Hebrew alphabet,
   and thus all excuses, on the score of ignorance, are removed, even from
   the callous and slothful. This help does not extend to those who read
   it in other languages; but the principle must not be overlooked, that
   the doctrine exhibited in this psalm should be carefully studied by all
   the children of God, and treasured up in their hearts, to render them
   the more conversant with it. Touching the author, I assert nothing,
   because it cannot be ascertained, even by probable conjecture, who he
   was; and expositors are agreed that no satisfactory conclusion can be
   arrived at in the matter. As David surpassed all others in point of
   poetical and devotional talent, I will not scruple occasionally to
   insert his name. [399]

   It may be proper to take notice of certain terms which frequently occur
   in the psalm. Of the term tvrh, torah, I say nothing, which, having its
   derivation from a word which signifies to instruct, is yet uniformly
   taken for law. Some of the Rabbis affirm that chvqym, chukim, signifies
   statutes, or divinely appointed rites, the, reason of which is very
   obvious. They say that phqdym, phikudim, denotes those precepts which
   relate to natural justice. It is certain that msphtym, mishpatim,
   signifies commandments, because this is proved by the etymology of the
   word. As to dvt, edoth, the Hebrews understand it of the doctrine of
   the law, but with the certain indication, pointing out to us that it is
   comprehensive of the manner in which God enters into covenant with his
   people. The precepts of the law are denominated judgments and
   righteousness, to inform us that God enjoins nothing except what is
   right and just, and that mankind ought to seek for no other rule for
   the perfecting of holiness, but what consists in regulating their life
   by rendering obedience to the law. The meaning is almost synonymous
   when they are called the ways of the Lord, intimating that those who do
   not depart from the direction of the law, may safely conclude that they
   are in no danger of going astray. The ordinances of God, and the edicts
   offerings, have the term chvqym, chukim, applied to them
   indiscriminately, and,phqvdym , phikudim, refers to different kinds of
   justice, as is manifest from many parts of Scripture which demonstrates
   that there is no foundation for the subtle distinction and difference
   formerly noticed. And in this psalm almost all these terms are synonym
   as the context will show. [400] To procure greater respect for the law,
   the prophet adorns it with a variety of titles, taking care constantly
   to enjoin upon us the same doctrine. I now proceed to the consideration
   of the contents of the psalm.

   1 Blessed are they who are upright In these words the prophet sets
   forth the same paradox which we met with at the commencement of the
   Book of Psalms. All men naturally aspire after happiness, but instead
   of searching for it in the right path, they designedly prefer wandering
   up and down through endless by-paths, to their ruin and destruction.
   The Holy Spirit deservedly condemns this apathy and blindness. And but
   for man's cupidity, which, with brutish impetuosity, hurries him in the
   opposite direction, the meaning of the words would appear quite plain
   to him. And the further a man wanders from God, the happier does he
   imagine himself to be; and hence all treat, as a fable, what the Holy
   Spirit declares about true piety and the service of God. This is a
   doctrine which scarcely one among a hundred receives.

   The term way, is here put for the manner, or course and way of life:
   and hence he calls those upright in their way, whose sincere and
   uniform desire it is to practice righteousness, and to devote their
   life to this purpose. In the next clause of the verse, he specifics
   more clearly, that a godly and righteous life consists in walking in
   the law of God If a person follow his own humor and caprice, he is
   certain to go astray; and even should he enjoy the applause of the
   whole world, he will only weary himself with very vanity. But it may be
   asked, whether the prophet excludes from the hope of happiness all who
   do not worship God perfectly? Were this his meaning, it would follow
   that none except angels alone would be happy, seeing that the perfect
   observance of the law is to be found in no part, of the earth. The
   answer is easy: When uprightness is demanded of the children of God,
   they do not lose the gracious remission of their sins, in which their
   salvation alone consists. While, then, the servants of God are happy,
   they still need to take refuge in his mercy, because their uprightness
   is not complete. In this manner are they who faithfully observe the law
   of God said to be truly happy; and thus is fulfilled that which is
   declared in Psalm 32:2, "Blessed are they to whom God imputeth not
   sins." In the second verse, the same doctrine is confirmed more fully,
   by pronouncing blessed, not. such as are wise in their own conceit, or
   assume a sort of fantastical holiness, but those who dedicate
   themselves to the covenant of God, and yield obedience to the dictates
   of hits law. Farther, by these words, he tells us that God is by no
   means satisfied with mere external service, for he demands the sincere
   and honest affection of the heart. And assuredly, if God be the sole
   judge and disposer of our life:, the truth must occupy the principal
   place in our heart, because it is not sufficient to have our hands and
   feet only enlisted in his service.

   3. Surely they do not work iniquity The statement, that they who follow
   God as their guide do not work iniquity, may seem to be a mere
   common-place, and universally admitted truth. The prophet has two
   reasons for making it; first, to teach us that our life must be
   entirely under the direction of God; and, secondly, that we may more
   diligently and carefully attend to his doctrine. It is acknowledged by
   every one, that those who render obedience to God are in no danger of
   going astray, and yet every one is found turning aside to his own ways.
   Does not such licentiousness or presumption palpably demonstrate that
   they have a greater regard for their own devices than for the unerring
   law of God? And after all, as often as a man happens to fall, is not
   the plea of inadvertence instantly alleged, as if none ever sinned
   knowingly and voluntarily; or as if the law of God, which is an
   antidote to all delinquencies, because it keeps all our vicious
   propensities in check, did not furnish us with sufficient wisdom to put
   us upon our guard? The prophet, therefore, very justly declares, that
   those who are instructed in the law of God, cannot set up the plea of
   ignorance when they fall into sin, seeing they are willfully blind.
   Were they to attend carefully to God's voice, they would be well
   fortified against all the snares of Satan. To strike them with terror,
   he informs them in the fourth verse, that God demands a rigid
   observance of the law; from which it may be gathered, that he will not
   suffer the contemners of it to escape with impunity. Besides, by
   speaking to God in the second person, he places him before our eyes as
   a Judge.

   5 I wish that my ways may be directed The original word kvn, kun, is
   sometimes rendered to establish, and, accordingly, it may seem as if
   the prophet were soliciting for himself the virtue of perseverance. I
   am rather inclined to understand it as signifying to direct; for,
   although God's plainly instructing us in his law, the obtuseness of our
   understanding, and the perversity of our hearts, constantly need the
   direction of his Spirit. Our main desire, therefore, ought to be for an
   understanding wisely regulated by the law of God, and also for a docile
   and obedient heart. Next, he adds, if a man carefully observe the law
   of God, he need be under no apprehension that he will ever regret what
   he has done or undertaken to do. The word respect intimates, that we
   must not be influenced by our own designs, nor decide, according to
   Carnal reason, what we are to do, but must at once come to the
   determination, that they who turn not aside, either to the right hand
   or the left, from the observance of God's commandments, are indeed in
   the right path. They who reverently respect his law, may not escape the
   censure of the great bulk of mankind, yet the prophet declares, that
   They shall not be ashamed, because they have a good conscience in the
   presence of God and the angels, and, with the approval of this
   celestial assembly, they are well satisfied and contented; for if they
   depended upon the opinion of the world, their courage would presently
   fail. He says, all thy precepts, intimating, that among the snares of
   Satan, amid such thick darkness and so great insensibility as ours, the
   utmost vigilance and caution are necessary, if we would aim at being
   entirely exempted from blame. Wherefore, in all that we do, we must
   endeavor to have the law before us, to keep us from falling.

   7. I will praise thee He affirms it to be a singular instance of the
   loving-kindness of God, if a person has made considerable proficiency
   in his law. As a token and testimony of this, he here puts the giving
   of thanks to God; as if he should say, Lord, thou wilt confer upon me
   an inestimable blessing, if thou instruct me in thy law. It follows,
   therefore, that nothing in this life is more to be desired than this;
   and my fervent prayer is, that we may be fairly and fully convinced of
   the truth of it. For while searching carefully after such things as we
   deem advantageous to us, we do not overlook any earthly convenience,
   and yet we neglect that which is of most importance. The phrase, the
   judgments of thy righteousness, is the same with the commandments, in
   which perfect righteousness is comprehended; and thus the prophet
   commends God's law on account of the thorough perfection of the
   doctrine contained in it. From this verse we learn, that none will
   praise God unfeignedly and cordially but he who has made such
   proficiency in his school as to mold his life into subjection to him.
   It is vain to make a pretense of praising God with the mouth and the
   tongue if we dishonor him by our life. Hence the prophet very justly
   here makes the fruit of genuine piety to consist in celebrating the
   praises of God without hypocrisy.

   8 I will observe thy statutes In these words he avers it to be his
   intention to observe the law of God, but, conscious of his own
   weakness, he utters a prayer that God would not deprive him of his
   grace. The term forsake is susceptible of two interpretations, either
   that God withdraws his Spirit, or that he permits his people to be
   brought low by adversity, as if he had forsaken them. The latter
   interpretation agrees best with the context, and is most in accordance
   with the phrase immediately subjoined, very far The prophet is not
   altogether averse to the trial of his faith, only he is apprehensive
   lest it might fail were the trial to be too long protracted, and
   therefore he desires to be treated with tenderness in his infirmity.,'
   O God! thou sees my frame of mind, and, as I am but a man, do not
   conceal too long from me the tokens of thy favor, or defer helping me
   longer than is proper for me, lest, imagining myself to be forsaken of
   thee, I turn aside from the direct pursuit of godliness."

   [396] "Vel, perfecti." -- Lat. marg. "Or, perfect."

   [397] m'd, meod, superlatively, -- to the uttermost.

   [398] Hammond reads, "O forsake me not to any great degree;" and adds,
   "The Hebrew d-m'd, ad meod, here, and in verse 43, is literally unto
   very much. So the LXX. render it, heos sphodra, i e., to any high
   degree, the Chaldee, unto all at once,' but the Syriac, for ever, both
   referring it to the time, whereas the Hebrew seems rather to the
   degree, from the noun that signifies multitude, plenty, abundance."

   [399] Some consider this psalm, as well as all the other alphabetic
   psalms, to be much more modern compositions than the time of David, and
   refer it to the time of the captivity in Babylon. But many others, as
   Venema, Michaelis, etc., ascribe it to David, and suppose it to have
   been written before his elevation to the throne. Its contents,
   certainly, favor this latter opinion, seeming to accord so well with
   the long and harassing persecution to which he was subjected by the
   malice and revenge of Saul. If David was its author, it is the most
   artificial and operose in its composition of all his psalms, and he has
   exhibited in the treatment of his subject -- which is the celebration
   of the perfection of God's law, and the happiness of those who obey it
   -- an extraordinary fecundity of expression, as if one of his
   intentions had been to show in how many various shapes, and with what
   copiousness of words, he could enunciate and illustrate a few and the
   same topics. The aspirations for instruction, consolation, and
   protection, with which almost every portion of this psalm is mingled,
   have a soothing and delightful effect, whilst the language throughout
   is rendered impressive by its peculiar strength and concinnity. It may,
   however, be doubtful, whether it be just to elevate it, as has been
   done by some, above all the other psalms. Dr Adam Clarke justly
   remarks, "Like all other portions of divine revelation, it is elegant,
   important, and useful; and while I admire the fecundity of the
   Psalmist's genius, the unabating flow of his poetic vein, his numerous
   synonymes, and his copia verborum, by which he is enabled to expound,
   diversify, and illustrate the same idea: presenting it to his reader in
   all possible points of view, so as to render it pleasing, instructive,
   and impressive; I cannot rob the rest of the book of its just praise by
   setting this, as many have done, above all the pieces it contains. It
   is by far the longest, the most artificial, and most diversified, yet,
   in proportion to its length, it contains the fewest ideas of any in the
   book."

   [400] Others deny that these and other similar terms, which frequently
   occur in this psalm, are mere synonymes; and they have endeavoured to
   show from etymological investigation, that, although all of them
   designate the law, yet they present it under a different aspect. Jebb
   has attempted, at some length, to point out the specific differences
   between these words. The following is an abstract of his remarks: --
   "The next peculiarity to be observed in this psalm is, the regular
   recurrence of nine characteristic words, at least one or other of which
   is found in each distich, with one solitary exception, the second
   distich of the 12th division. These words are law, testimonies,
   precepts, statutes, commandments, judgments, word, saying; and a word
   which only twice occurs as a characteristic, -- way. "These are,
   doubtless, all designations of the Divine Law; but it were doing a deep
   injury to the cause of revealed truth to affirm that they are mere
   synonyms; in other words, that the sentiments of this compendium of
   heavenly wisdom are little better than a string of tautologies. The
   fact is, as some critics, both Jewish and Christian, have observed,
   that each of these terms designates the same law of God, but each under
   a different aspect, signifying the different modes of its promulgation,
   and of its reception. Each of these words will now be examined in
   order, and an attempt will be made to discriminate them. "1. Law. This
   word is formed from a verb which means to direct, to guide, to aim, to
   shoot forwards. Its etymological meaning, then, would be a rule of
   conduct, a kanon saphes. It means God's law in general, whether it be
   that universal rule called the law of nature, or that which was
   revealed to his Church by Moses, and perfected by Christ. In
   strictness, the law means a plain rule of conduct, rather placed
   clearly in man's sight, than enforced by any command; that is to say,
   this word does not necessarily include its sanctions. "2. Testimonies
   are derived from a word which signifies to bear witness, to testify.
   The ark of the tabernacle is so called, as are the two tables of stone,
   and the tabernacle: the earnests and witnesses of God's inhabitation
   among his people. Testimonies are more particularly God's revealed law:
   the witnesses and confirmation of his promises made to his people, and
   earnests of his future salvation. "3. Precepts, from a word which means
   to place in trust, mean something intrusted to man, that which is
   committed to thee:' appointments of God, which consequently have to do
   with the conscience, for which man is responsible, as an intelligent
   being. "4. Statutes. The verb from which this word is formed means to
   engrave or inscribe. The word means a definite prescribed written law.
   The term is applied to Joseph's law about the portion of the priests in
   Egypt, to the law about the Passover, etc. But in this psalm it has a
   more internal meaning; -- that moral law of God, which is engraved on
   the fleshy tables of the heart; the inmost and spiritual apprehension
   of his will: not so obvious as the law and testimonies, and a matter of
   more direct spiritual communication than his precepts: the latter being
   more elaborated by the efforts of the mind itself, divinely guided
   indeed, but perhaps more instrumentally, and less passively, employed.
   "5. Commandments, derived from a verb signifying to command or ordain.
   Such was God's command to Adam about the tree; to Noah about
   constructing the ark. "6. Judgments, derived from a word signifying to
   govern, to judge or determine, mean judicial ordinances and decisions:
   legal sanctions. "7. Word. There are two terms, quite distinct in the
   Hebrew, but both rendered word, in each of our authorized versions. The
   latter of these is rendered saying in the former volume of this work.
   They are closely connected; since out of twenty-two passages in which
   word occurs, in fourteen it is parallel to, or in connection with,
   saying. From this very circumstance it is evident they are not
   synonymous. "The term here rendered word means the Logos, or Word of
   God, in its most divine sense; the announcement of God's revealed will;
   his command; his oracle; at times, the special communication to the
   prophets. The ten commandments are called by this term in Exodus: and
   dvyr is the oracle in the temple. In this psalm it may be considered
   as, -- 1. God's revealed commandments in general. 2. As a revealed
   promise of certain blessings to the righteous. 3. As a thing committed
   to him as the minister of God. 4. As a rule of conduct; a channel of
   illumination. "8. As to the remaining word way, that occurs but twice
   as a characteristic word, and the places in which it occurs must rather
   be considered as exceptions to the general rule: so that I am not
   disposed to consider it as intended to be a cognate expression with the
   above. At all events, its meaning is so direct and simple as to require
   no explanation: a plain rule of conduct; in its higher sense, the
   assisting grace of God through Christ our Lord, who is the Way, the
   Truth, and the Life." -- Jebb's Literal Translation of the book of
   Psalms, with Dissertations, volume 2, pages 279-293.

   Psalm 119:9-16

   v 9. Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed
   according to thy word. v 10. I have sought thee with my whole heart; do
   not permit me to wander from thy commandments. v 11. I have hid thy
   word in my heart, [401] that I might not sin against thee. v 12.
   Blessed art thou, O Jehovah! teach me thy statutes. v 13. With my lips
   have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. v 14. I have taken
   pleasure in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. v 15.
   I will meditate upon thy precepts, and will take heed to thy paths. v
   16. I will delight, myself in thy statutes; I will not forget thy
   words.


   9. Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? In this place he
   repeats, in different words, the same truth which he formerly advanced,
   That, however much men may pique themselves upon their own works, there
   is nothing pure in their life until they have made a complete surrender
   of themselves to the word of the Lord. The more effectually to excite
   them to this, he produces, in an especial manner, the example of
   children or youths. In mentioning these, he by no means gives an
   unbridled license to those who have arrived at mature years, or who are
   aged, as if they were competent to regulate their own life, and as if
   their own prudence served as a law to them; but because youth puts men
   where two ways meet, and renders it imperative for them to select the
   course of life which they mean to follow, he declares that, when a
   person sets about the regulation of his life, no advice will prove of
   any advantage, unless he adopts the law of God as his rule and guide.
   In this way the prophet stimulates men to an early and seasonable
   regulation of their manners, and not to delay doing so any longer,
   agreeably to the words of Solomon, "Remember thy Creator in thy youth,
   ere the days of trouble come, and the years which shall be grief unto
   thee," Ecclesiastes 12:1 [402] They who defer from time to time become
   hardened in their vicious practices, and arrive at mature years, when
   it is too late to attempt a reformation. There is another reason,
   arising from the fact, of the carnal propensities being very powerful
   in youth, requiring a dortble restraint; and the more they are inclined
   to excess, the greater is the necessity for curbing their
   licentiousness. The prophet, therefore, not without reason, exhorts
   them particularly to attend to the observance of the law. We may reason
   from the greater to the less; for if the law of God possesses the power
   of restraining the impetuosity of youth, so as to preserve pure and
   upright all who take it for their guide, then, assuredly, when they
   come to maturity, and their irregular desires are considerably abated,
   it will prove the best antidote for correcting their vices. The reason,
   therefore, of so much evil prevailing in the world, arises from men
   wallowing in their own impurity, and being disposed to yield more to
   their own inclination than to heavenly instruction. The only sure
   protection is, to regulate ourselves according to God's word. Some,
   wise in their own conceit, throw themselves into the snares of Satan,
   others, from listlessness and languor, live a vile and wicked life.

   10. With my whole heart Conscious of the integrity of his heart, the
   prophet still implores the help of God, that he might not stumble by
   reason of his infirmity. He makes no boast of self-preparation, as if
   he had spontaneously begun to inquire after God, but in praising the
   grace which he had experienced, he at the same time aspires after
   steadfastness to persevere in walking in his ways. It is folly on the
   part of the Papists to seize upon this and similar passages, as if the
   saints, of their own free will, anticipated the grace of the Holy
   Spirit, and afterwards were favored with his aid. The prophet does not
   make a division between God and himself, but rather prays God to
   continue his work till it is completed, agreeably with what we are
   generally taught, to keep God mindful of his benefits until he
   accomplish them.

   In the meantime, there is good cause for presenting our supplication to
   God, to stretch out his hand towards us when he sees our minds so
   settled, that we are solicitous of nothing so much as acting uprightly.
   And as he elevates us with confidence to ask the gift of perseverance,
   when he inspires our hearts with proper affection towards him, so also
   does he entreat us for the future not to sink into a careless and
   languid state like soldiers who have been discharged, but seek to be
   constantly directed by the spirit of wisdom, and to be sustained by the
   principles of fortitude and virtue. David here, from his own example,
   points out to us a rule, that by how much a man finds himself succored
   by God, by so much ought he to be induced the more carefully and
   earnestly to implore the continuance of his aid; for unless he restrain
   us, we will instantly wander and go astray. This sentiment is more
   explicitly stated in the original word tsgny, tashqeni, which is in the
   passive voice, and signifies, to be led astray [403] From the import of
   the term, I do not mean to establish the doctrine that God secretly
   incites us to commit sin, but only to let my readers know, that such is
   our liability to err, that we immediately relapse into sin the instant
   he leaves us to ourselves. This passage also admonishes us that the man
   who swerves but a little from God's commandments is guilty of going
   astray.

   11. I have hid thy word in my heart. This psalm not being composed for
   the personal and peculiar use of the author only, we may therefore
   understand, that as frequently as David sets before us his own example,
   under this model he points out the course we ought to pursue. Here we
   are informed that we are well fortified against the stratagems of Satan
   when God's law is deeply seated in our hearts. For unless it have a
   fast and firm hold there, we will readily fall into sin. Among
   scholars, those whose knowledge is confined to books, if they have not
   the book always before them, readily discover their ignorance; in like
   manner, if we do not imbibe the doctrine of God, and are well
   acquainted with it, Satan will easily surprise and entangle us in his
   meshes. Our true safeguard, then, lies not in a slender knowledge of
   his law, or in a careless perusal of it, but in hiding it deeply in our
   hearts. Here we are reminded, that however men may be convinced of
   their own wisdom, they are yet destitute of all right judgment, except
   as far as they have God as their teacher.

   12. Blessed art thou, O Jehovah! Such had been the prophet's
   proficiency, that he was not only one of God's disciples, but also a
   public teacher of the Church. Nevertheless, acknowledging himself and
   all the upright to be only one their journey till they arrive at the
   close of life, he fails not to ask for the spirit of understanding.
   This passage informs us generally, that if God do not enlighten us with
   the spirit of discernment, we are not competent to behold the light
   which shines forth from his law, though it be constantly before us. And
   thus it happens, that not a few are blind even when surrounded with the
   clear revelation of this doctrine, because, confident in their own
   perspicacity, they contemn the internal illumination of the Holy
   Spirit. Farther, let us learn from this passage, that none are
   possessed of such superiority of intellect as not to admit of constant
   increase. If the prophet, upon whom God had conferred so honorable an
   office as a teacher of the Church, confesses himself to be only a
   disciple or scholar, what madness is it for those who are, greatly
   behind him in point of attainments not to strain every nerve to rise to
   higher excellence? Nor does he depend upon his own merits for obtaining
   his requests; he beseeches God to grant them from a regard to his own
   glory. This appears from the phraseology by which he introduces his
   request, Blessed art thou, O Jehovah! intimating, that his confidence
   of success originated in God's being fully entitled to all praise on
   account of his unbounded goodness, justice, and mercy.

   13. With my lips In this verse he declares that the law of God was not
   only deeply engraven on his own heart, but that it was his earnest and
   strenuous endeavor to gain over many of his fellow-disciples into
   subjection to God. It is indeed a heartless matter to speak of the law
   of God abstractly, as we see hypocrites do, who talk very fluently
   about the whole doctrine of godliness, to which they are entire
   strangers. What the prophet noticed above, respecting the affection of
   the heart for God's law, he now likewise applies to the lips. And,
   immediately afterwards, he again establishes the truth of what he had
   asserted about his cordial and unfeigned endeavors to instruct others;
   by saying, that he derived no less pleasure from the doctrine of God
   than from all the riches of the world. He indirectly contrasts his holy
   love for the law, with which he was inflamed, with the unholy avarice
   which has taken possession of almost all the world. "As wealth attracts
   to itself the hearts of mankind, so I have taken more exquisite delight
   in the progress which I make in the doctrine of godliness, than if I
   abounded in all manner of riches."

   15. In thy precepts That to which I formerly adverted must not be
   forgotten -- the prophet's not making a boast of his own acquirements,
   but setting before others an example for their imitation. We are aware
   that the majority of mankind are so much involved in the cares of the
   world, as to leave no time or leisure for meditating upon the doctrine
   of God. To meet this callous indifference, he very seasonably commends
   diligence and attention. And even were we not so ensnared by the world,
   we know how readily we lose sight of the law of God, in the daily
   temptations which suddenly overtake us. It is not therefore without
   reason that the prophet exhorts us to constant exercise, and enjoins us
   to direct all our energies to the subject of meditation on God's
   precepts. And as the life of men is unstable, being continually
   distracted by the carnality of their minds, he declares that he will
   consider attentively the ways of God. Subsequently, he repeats the
   exquisite pleasure he took in this pursuit. For our proficiency in the
   law of God will be small, until we cheerfully and heartily set our
   minds upon it. And, in fact, the commencement of a good life consists
   in God's law attracting us to him by its sweetness. By the same means
   the lusts of the flesh, too, are subdued or mitigated. In our natural
   state, what is more agreeable to us than that which is sinful? This
   will be the constant tendency of our minds, unless the delight which we
   feel in the law carry us in the opposite direction.

   Psalm 119:17-24

   g 17. Do good to thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word. g 18.
   Open my eyes, and I shall see the marvelous things of thy law. g 19. I
   am a stranger on the earth: do not conceal from me thy commandments. g
   20. My soul is rent with the desire it hath at all times unto thy
   judgments. g 21. Thou hast destroyed the proud, they are accursed that
   wander from thy commandments. g 22. Remove from me reproach and
   contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies. g 23. Princes also did sit,
   they spoke against me: thy servant meditated on thy statutes. g 24.
   Also thy testimonies are my delights, the men of my counsel.


   17. Do good to thy servant The term gml gamal, which some render to
   requite, does not, among the Hebrews, import mutual recompense, but
   frequently signifies to confer a benefit, as in Psalm 116:7, and many
   other passages. Here it must be viewed as expressive of free favor. The
   words, however, may admit of two senses. They may be read as a separate
   clause, in this manner: O God! display thy goodness to thy servant, and
   thus I shall live, or then I shall esteem myself happy. Or the verse
   may form one connected statement: O God! grant to thy servant the favor
   that, while I live, I may keep thy commandments. If the former lection
   is adopted, then, by these words, the prophet declares that, without
   the favor of God, he is like a dead man; that though he might abound in
   every thing else, yet he could not subsist without feeling that God was
   propitious towards him. The latter interpretation is preferable, That
   the prophet asks as a principal favor, that, while he lives, he may
   devote himself entirely to God; being fully persuaded that the grand
   object of his existence consists in his exercising himself in his
   service, an object which he firmly resolves to pursue. For this reason
   these two clauses are connected together, that I may live, and keep thy
   word. "I desire no other mode of living than that of approving myself
   to be a true and faithful servant of God." All wish God to grant them a
   prolongation of their life; a wish after which the whole world ardently
   aspire, and yet there is scarcely one among a hundred who reflects upon
   the purpose for which he ought to live. To withdraw us from cherishing
   such irrational propensities, the prophet here describes the main
   object of our existence. He declares it to be owing to the peculiar
   grace of the Holy Spirit, that any person keeps the law of God. Had he
   imagined that the preparing oneself for the observance of his law
   depended on his own free will, then this prayer would have been nothing
   else than downright hypocrisy.

   Very similar is the doctrine contained in the next verse. Having
   acknowledged, that power to keep the law is imparted to men by God, he,
   at the same time, adds, that every man is blind, until he also
   enlighten the eyes of his understanding. Admitting that God gives light
   to us by his word, the prophet here means that we are blind amid the
   clearest light, until he remove the veil from our eyes. When he
   confesses that his eyes are veiled and shut, rendering him unable to
   discern the light of the heavenly doctrine, until God, by the invisible
   grace of his Spirit, open them, he speaks as if he were deploring his
   own blindness, and that of the whole human race. But, while God claims
   this power for himself, he tells us that the remedy is at hand,
   provided we do not, by trusting to our own wisdom, reject the gracious
   illumination offered to us. Let us learn, too, that we do not receive
   the illumination of the Spirit of God to make us contemn the external
   word, and take pleasure only in secret inspirations, like many
   fanatics, who do not regard themselves spiritual, except they reject
   the word of God, and substitute in its place their own wild
   speculations. Very different is the prophet's aim, which is to inform
   us that our illumination is to enable us to discern the light of life,
   that God manifests by his word. He designates the doctrine of the law,
   marvelous things, [404] to humble us, to contemplate with admiration
   its height; and to convince us the more of our need of the grace of
   God, to comprehend the mysteries, which surpass our limited capacity.
   From which we infer, that not only the ten commandments are included in
   the term la but also the covenant of eternal salvation, with all its
   provisions, which God has made. And knowing, as we do, that Christ, "in
   whom are hid all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom," "is the end of
   the law," we need not be surprised at the prophet commending it, in
   consequence of the sublime mysteries which it contains, Colossians 2:3;
   Romans 10:4

   19. I am a stranger on the earth. It is proper to inquire into the
   reason for his calling himself a sojourner and stranger in the world.
   The great concern of the unholy and worldly is to spend their life here
   easily and quietly; but those who know that they have their journey to
   pursue, and have their inheritance reserved for them in heaven, are not
   engrossed nor entangled with these perishable things, but aspire after
   that place to which they are invited. The meaning may be thus summed
   up: "Lord, since I must pass quickly through the earth, what will
   become of me if I am deprived of the doctrine of thy law?" We learn
   from these words from what point we must commence our journey, if we
   would go on our way cheerfully unto God.

   Besides, God is said to conceal his commandments from those whose eyes
   he does not open, because, not being endued with spiritual vision, in
   seeing they see not, so that what is before their eyes is hid from
   them. And, to demonstrate that he does not present his request in a
   careless manner, the prophet adds, that his affection for the law is
   most intense; for it is no common ardor which is expressed by him in
   the following language, My soul is rent with the desire it hath at all
   times unto thy judgments. As the man who may concentrate all his
   thoughts on one point with such intensity as almost to deprive him of
   the power of perception, may be said to be the victim of his
   intemperate zeal, so the prophet declares the energy of his mind to be
   paralyzed and exhausted by his ardent love for the law. [405] The
   clause, at all times, is meant to express his perseverance; for it may
   occasionally happen that a man may apply himself with great ardor to
   the study of the heavenly doctrine; but it is only temporary-his zeal
   soon vanishes away. Steadfastness is therefore necessary, lest, through
   weariness, we become faint in our minds.

   21. Thou hast destroyed the proud. Others render it:, Thou hast rebuked
   the proud; a translation of which the Hebrew term gr, gaar, admits when
   the letter v, beth, is joined with it in construction; but this being
   awaiting, it is better to render it destroy [406] It makes, however,
   little difference to the main drift of the passage, there being no
   doubt that the intention of the prophet is, to inform us that God's
   judgments instructed him to apply his mind to the study of the law; and
   certainly this is an exercise which we ought on no account to defer
   till God visit us with chastisement.. But when we behold him taking
   vengeance upon the wicked, and the despisers of his word, we must be
   stupid, indeed, if his rod do not teach us wisdom; and, doubtless, it
   is an instance of special kindness on God's part, to spare us, and only
   to terrify us from afar, that he may bring us to himself without
   injuring or chastising us at all.

   It is not without reason that he denominates all unbelievers proud,
   because it is true faith alone which humbles us, and all rebellion is
   the offspring of pride. From this we learn how profitable it is to
   consider carefully and attentively the judgments of God, by which he
   overthrows such haughtiness. When the weak in faith see the wicked rise
   in furious. opposition against God, arrogantly casting off all
   restraint, and holding all religion in derision with impunity, they
   begin to question whether there be a God who sits as judge in heaven.
   God may, for a time, wink at this: by-and-bye, we witness him setting
   forth some indication of his judgment, to convince us that he hath not
   in vain uttered threatening against the violators of his law; and we
   ought to bear in mind that all who depart from him are reprobate.

   Let it be carefully observed that, by wandering from his commandments,
   is not meant all kinds of transgression indiscriminately, but that
   unbridled licentiousness which proceeds from impious contempt of God.
   It is, indeed, given as a general sentence, that

   "every one is cursed who continueth not in all
   things which are written," Deuteronomy 27:26

   But as God in his paternal kindness, bears with those who fail through
   infirmity of the flesh, so here we must understand these judgments to
   be expressly executed upon the wicked and reprobate; and their end, as
   Isaiah declares, is,

   "that the inhabitants of the earth may learn righteousness,"
   (Isaiah 26:9)

   22. Remove from me reproach This verse may admit of two senses: Let the
   children of God walk as circumspectly as it is possible for them to do,
   they will not escape being liable to many slanders, and therefore they
   have good reason to petition God to protect the unfeigned godliness
   which they practice against poisonous tongues. The following meaning
   may not inappropriately be given to the passage: O Lord, since I am
   conscious to myself, and thou art a witness of my unfeigned integrity,
   do not permit the unrighteous to sully my reputation, by laying
   unfounded accusations to my charge. But the meaning will be more
   complete if we read it as forming one continued sentence: O God, permit
   not the ungodly to mock me for endeavoring to keep thy law. For this
   impiety has been rampant in the world even from the beginning, that the
   sincerity of God's worshippers has been matter of reproach and
   derision; even as, at this day, the same reproaches are still cast upon
   God's children, as if not satisfied with the common mode of living,
   they aspired being wiser than others. That which was spoken by Isaiah
   must now be accomplished, "Behold I and my children, whom thou hast
   given me to be for a sign;" so that God's children, with Christ their
   head, are, among the profane, as persons to be wondered at.
   Accordingly, Peter testifies that they charge us with madness for not
   following their ways, (1 Peter 4:4;) and as this reproach -- the
   becoming the subjects of ridicule on account of their unfeigned
   affection for God's law -- tends to the dishonor of his name, the
   prophet very justly demands the suppression of all these taunts; and
   Isaiah also, by his own example, directs us to flee to this refuge,
   because, although the wicked may arrogantly pour out their blasphemies
   on the earth, yet God sitteth in heaven as our judge.

   In the following verse, he states more plainly that it was not in vain
   he besought God to vindicate him from such calumnies; for he was held
   in derision, not only by the common people, and by the most abandoned
   of mankind, but also by the chief men, who sat as judges. The term, to
   sit, imports that they had spoken injuriously and unjustly of him, not
   merely in their houses and at their tables, but publicly and on the
   very judgment-seat, where it behooved them to execute justice, and
   render to every one his due. The particle gm, gam, which he employs,
   and which signifies also or even, contains an implied contrast between
   the secret whisperings of the common people, and the imperious
   decisions of these imperious men, enhancing still more the baseness of
   their conduct. Nevertheless, in the midst of all this he steadfastly
   persevered in following after godliness. Satan was assailing him with
   this device in order to drive him to despair, but he tells us that he
   sought a remedy from it in meditation on the law of God. We are here
   taught, that it is not unusual for earthly judges to oppress God's
   servants, and make a mock of their piety. If David could not escape
   this reproach, why should we, in these times, expect to do so? Let us
   further learn, that there is nothing more perverse than to place
   dependence upon the judgments of men, because, in doing so, we must, of
   necessity, constantly be in a state of vacillation. Let us therefore
   rest satisfied with the approbation of God, though men causelessly
   defame us -- not only men of low degree, but also the very judges
   themselves, from whom the utmost impartiality might be expected.

   24. Also thy testimonies are my delight The particle gm, gam, connects
   this with the preceding verse. To adhere unflinchingly to our purpose,
   when the world takes up an unjust opinion of us, and, at the same time,
   constantly to mediate on God's law, is an example of Christian
   fortitude seldom to be met with. The prophet now informs us how he
   overcame this temptation. Thy testimonies, says he, are my delight:
   "Although the cruel injustice of men, in charging me falsely, grieves
   and annoys me, yet the pleasurable delight which I take in thy law is a
   sufficient recompense for it all." He adds, that God's testimonies are
   his counselors, by which we are to understand he did not rely on his
   own judgment simply, but took counsel from the word of God. This point
   ought to be carefully considered, inasmuch as we see how blind
   affection predominates in directing the lives of men. Whence does the
   avaricious man ask council, but from the erroneous principle which he
   has assumed, that riches are superior to every thing? Why does the
   ambitious man aspire after nothing so much as power, but because he
   regards nothing equal to the holding of honorable rank in the world? It
   is not surprising, therefore, that men are so grievously misled, seeing
   they give themselves up to the direction of such evil counselors.
   Guided by the word of God, and prudently yielding obedience to its
   dictates, there will then be no inlet to the deceits of our flesh, and
   to the delusions of the world, and we will stand invincible against all
   the assaults of temptation.

   [404] Marvelous things "means things which are difficult and wonderful.
   The reference here is to the figures and adumbration's of the law,
   which so veiled and concealed the substances to which they related,
   that the mass of readers quite lost sight of them. The Psalmist
   therefore prays for Divine illumination, to enable him to solve, at
   least in some decree, the enigmas in which future things were
   enveloped." -- Walford

   [405] "Every intense exertion of mind has an influence, if it be long
   continued, to exhaust and impair the faculties in some degree. Such an
   effect is here alluded to; the close and assiduous attention which the
   Psalmist had paid, and the exertion of strong desire which he had
   exercised, produced the feeling which he here speaks of. He is also to
   be regarded as using the language of poetry, which admits of stronger
   colouring than prosaic description." -- Walford.

   Psalm 119:25-32

   d 25. My soul cleaveth to the dust: quicken me according to thy word. d
   26. I have declared my ways, and thou didst answer me: teach me thy
   statutes. d 27. Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: and I
   will meditate on thy wonderful works. d 28. My soul, droppeth [407]
   away for grief: [408] raise me up according to thy word. d 29. Take
   away from me the way of falsehood: and grant to me the favor of thy
   law. d 30. I have chosen the way of truth: and I have set thy judgments
   before me. d 31. I have cleaved to thy testimonies: O Jehovah! let me,
   not be ashamed. d 32. I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou
   shalt have enlarged my heart.


   25. My soul cleaveth to the dust [409] He means that he had no more
   hope of life than if he had been shut up in the tomb; and this must be
   carefully attended to, that we my not become impatient and grieved,
   whenever it may please God to make us endure various kinds of death.
   And, by his own example, he instructs us, when death stares us in the
   face, and all hope of escape fails, to present our petitions to God, in
   whose hand, as we have elsewhere seen, are the issues of death, and
   whose peculiar prerogative it is to restore life to those that are
   dead, (Psalm 68:21) As the combat is hard, he betakes himself to the
   promises of God, and invites others to do the same. The expression,
   according to thy word, [410] is an acknowledgment, that should he
   depart from God's word, no hope would be left for him; but as God has
   affirmed that the life of the faithful is in his hand, and under his
   protection, shut up as he was in the grave, he yet comforted himself
   with the expectation of life.

   26. I have declared my ways. In the first part of this verse he affirms
   he had prayed sincerely, and had not imitated the proud, who, trusting
   to their own wisdom, fortitude, and opulence, make not God their
   refuge. That man is said to declare his ways to God, who presumes
   neither to attempt nor undertake any thing unless with His assistance,
   and, depending wholly on His providence, commits all his plans to His
   sovereign pleasure, and centers all his affections in Him; doing all
   this honestly, and not as the hypocrites, who profess one thing with
   their lips, and conceal another within their hearts. He adds, that he
   was heard, which was of great importance in making him cherish good
   hope for the future.

   In the second part of the verse he solemnly declares, that he holds
   nothing more dear than the acquiring of a true understanding of the
   law. There are not a few who make known their desires unto God, but
   then they would that he would yield to their extravagant passions. And,
   therefore, the prophet affirms that he desires nothing more than to be
   well instructed in God's statutes. This statement is strengthened by
   the next verse, in which he once more asks the knowledge of these to be
   communicated to him. In both passages it must be carefully observed,
   that with the law of God set before us, we will reap little benefit
   from merely perusing it, if we have not his Spirit as our internal
   teacher.

   Some expositors will have the word which I have translated, I will
   meditate, to be, I will entreat or argue, and thus the Hebrew term
   svch, shuach, is referred both to the words and thoughts. The latter
   meaning is most in accordance with the scope of the passage. I take the
   import of the prophet's words to be this: -- That I may meditate upon
   thy wondrous works, make me to understand thy commandments. We will
   have no relish for the law of God until he sanctify our minds, and
   render them susceptible of tasting heavenly wisdom. And from this
   disrelish springs indifference, so that it is a grievous thing for the
   world to give a respectful attention to the law of God, having no savor
   for the admirable wisdom contained in it. With great propriety,
   therefore, does the prophet pray that this way may be opened to him by
   the gift of knowledge. From these words we are instructed, that in
   proportion to the spirit of knowledge given to us, our regard for the
   law of God, and our delight in meditating on it, ought to increase.

   28. My soul droppeth away for grief As a little before he said that his
   soul cleaved to the dust, so now, almost in the same manner, he
   complains that it melted away with grief. Some are of opinion that he
   alludes to tears, as if he had said that his soul was dissolved in
   tears. But the simpler meaning is, that his strength was poured out
   like water. The verb is in the future tense, yet it denotes a continued
   action. The prophet assures himself of a remedy for this his extreme
   sorrow, provided God stretch out his hand towards him. Formerly, when
   almost lifeless, he entertained the expectation of a revival through
   the grace of God; now also, by the same means, he cherishes the hope of
   being restored to renovated and complete vigor, notwithstanding he was
   nearly consumed. He repeats the expression, according to thy word,
   because, apart from his word, God's power would afford us little
   comfort. But when he comes to our aid, even should our courage and
   strength fail, his promise is abundantly efficacious to fortify us.

   29. Take away from me the way of falsehood. Knowing how prone the
   nature of man is to vanity and falsehood, he first asks the
   sanctification of his thoughts, lest, being entangled by the snares of
   Satan, he fall into error. Next, that he may be kept from falsehood, he
   prays to be fortified with the doctrine of the law. The second clause
   of the verse is interpreted variously. Some render it, make thy law
   pleasant to me. And as the law is disagreeable to the flesh, which it
   subdues and keeps under, there is good cause why God should be asked to
   render it acceptable and pleasant to us. Some expound it, have mercy
   upon me according to thy law as if the prophet should draw pity from
   the fountain-head itself, because God in his law promised it to the
   faithful. Both of these meanings appear to me forced; and, therefore, I
   am more disposed to adopt another, freely grant to me thy law. The
   original term, chnny channeni, cannot be translated otherwise in Latin
   than, gratify thou me; an uncouth and barbarous expression I admit, yet
   that will give me: little concern, provided my readers comprehend the
   prophet's meaning. [411] The amount is, that being full of blindness,
   nothing is more easy than for us to be greatly deceived by error. And,
   therefor unless God teach us by the Spirit of wisdom, we will presently
   be hurried away into various errors. The means of our being preserved
   from error are stated to consist in his instructing us in his law. He
   makes use of the term to gratify. "It is indeed an incomparable
   kindness that men are directed by thy law, but in consequence of thy
   kindness being unmerited, I have no hesitation in asking of thee to
   admit me as a participator of this thy kindness." If the prophet, who
   for some time previous served God, in now aspiring after farther
   attainments, does not ask for a larger measure of grace to be
   communicated to him meritoriously, but confesses it to be the free gift
   of God, then that impious tenet, which obtains in the papacy, that an
   increase of grace is awarded to merit as deserving of it, must fall to
   the ground.

   30. I have chosen the way of truth. In this and the following verse he
   affirms that he was so disposed as to desire nothing more than to
   follow righteousness and truth. It is, therefore, with great propriety
   he employs the term to choose. The old adage, that man's life is as it
   were at the point where two ways meet, refers not simply to the general
   tenor of human life, but to every particular action of it. For no
   sooner do we undertake any thing, no matter how small, than we are
   grievously perplexed, and as if hurried off by a tempest, are
   confounded by conflicting counsels. Hence the prophet declares, that in
   order constantly to pursue the right path, he had resolved and fully
   determined not to relinquish the truth. And thus he intimates that he
   was not entirely exempted from temptations, yet that he had surmounted
   them by giving himself up to the conscientious observance of the law.

   The last clause of the verse, I have set thy judgments before me,
   relates to the same subject. There would be no fixed choice on the part
   of the faithful, unless they steadily contemplate the law, and did not
   suffer their eyes to wander to and fro. In the subsequent verse he not
   only asserts his entertaining this holy affection for the law, but also
   combines it with prayer, that he might not become ashamed and enfeebled
   under the derision of the ungodly, while he gave himself wholly to the
   law of God. Here he employs the same term as formerly, when he said his
   soul cleaved to the dust, and, in doing so, affirms he had so firmly
   taken hold of God's law, that he cannot be separated from it. From his
   expressing a fear lest he might be put to shame or overwhelmed with
   reproach, we learn that the more sincerely a man surrenders himself to
   God, the more will he be assailed by the tongues of the vile and the
   venomous.

   32 I will run the way of thy commandments. The meaning of the prophet
   is, that when God shall inspire him with love for his la he will be
   vigorous and ready, nay, even steady, so as not to faint in the middle
   of his course. His words contain an implied admission of the supineness
   inability of men to make any advancement in well-doing until God
   enlarge their hearts. No sooner does God expand their hearts, than they
   are fitted not only for walking, but also for running in the way of his
   commandments. He reminds us that the proper observance of the law
   consists not merely in external works, -- that it demands willing
   obedience, so that the heart must, to some extent, and in some way,
   enlarge itself. Not that it has the self-determining power of doing
   this, but when once its hardness and obstinacy are subdued, it moves
   freely without being any longer contracted by its own narrowness.
   Finally, this passage tells us, when God has once enlarged our hearts,
   there will be no lack of power, because, along with proper affection,
   he will furnish ability, so that our feet will be ready to run.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [407] My soul may here be considered equivalent to I myself. In
   Jeremiah 51:14, by my soul is rendered, in our English translation, by
   myself.

   [408] "Mon ame s'escoule goutte a goutte." -- Fr. "Floweth drop by
   drop." Walford, who translates "is bowed down," considers Calvin's
   translation objectionable, as it does not correspond with the prayer in
   the succeeding sentence, Raise me up according to thy word. "The Vulgar
   translation of this clause," says he, "my soul melteth,' or, as other
   interpreters think, my soul is dissolved into tears,' appears to be
   inadmissible, chiefly on account of the next clause. Dathe, following
   Driessenius, Knapp, and Seiler, explains it, as is here done, by is
   bowed down,' a sense which the word dlph has in the Arabic use of it,
   and which certainly agrees with the connection much better than that of
   weeping or dissolving."

   [409] The original word for my soul might here, as in verse 28, be
   translated I myself, or my life, and then, cleaving to the dust may
   imply an apprehension of approaching death; and this agrees best with
   the petition. "By dust is here probably meant the sepulchre or grave,
   as in Psalm 22:15, 29, so that the Psalmist is to be understood to say,
   The dangers which surround me are such as threaten my death;' and he
   immediately adds, Revive me according to thy word,' i.e., Make me glad
   by delivering me from these perils, in agreement with the promises
   which thou hast given me." -- Walford

   [410] Arnobins and Augustine interpret thy word as signifying, in this
   place, thy promise. See verse 28, and Psalm 44:25.

   [411] "On pourroit dire en francois, Donne moy gratuitement." -- Fr.
   "One can say in French, Give me gratuitously."

   Psalm 119:33-40

   h 33. Teach me, O Jehovah! the way of thy statutes; and I will keep it
   unto the end. h 34. Make me to understand, and I will observe thy law;
   and keep it with my whole heart. h 35. Direct me in the way of thy
   statutes; for in it does my heart take pleasure. h 36. Incline my heart
   to thy testimonies, and not unto covetousness. h 37. Turn away mine
   eyes from seeing vanity; in thy way quicken me. h 38. Confirm thy word
   to thy servant, who .is devoted to thy ear. h 39. Remove from me the
   reproach of which I am afraid: for thy judgments are good. h 40. Lo! I
   have a desire to thy commandments: quicken me in thy righteousness.


   33. Teach me, O Jehovah/the way of thy statutes. He again presents the
   same prayer which he has already frequently done in this psalm, it
   being of the last importance for us to know that the main thing in our
   life consists in having God for our governor. The majority of mankind
   think of anything rather than this, as that which they ought to ask
   from God. The Holy Spirit, therefore, often inculcates this desire, and
   we ought always to keep it in mind, that not only the inexperienced and
   unlearned, but those who have made great progress, may not cease to
   aspire after farther advancement. And as the Spirit of understanding
   comes from above, they should seek to be guided by his invisible agency
   to the proper knowledge of the law.

   In the second clause of the verse the prophet points out the particular
   kind of doctrine of which he treats, that which virtually and
   effectually tends to renovate the heart of man. Interpreters explain
   the word qv, ekeb, two ways. Some would have it to denote wages or
   reward, and then the Psalmist's meaning would be: After I have been
   well instructed, then shall I know that those who apply themselves to
   the observance of thy law will not labor in vain; and, therefore, for
   the sake of the reward, I will keep thy commandments, persuaded that
   thou wilt never disappoint thy servants. Others render it, until the
   end, because those whom God teaches he teaches successfully, and, at
   the same time, strengthens them for prosecuting their journey without
   feeling lassitude or languor by the way, and enables them to persevere
   with constancy until they arrive at the termination of their course. I
   am far from supposing that he has no reference to the grace of
   perseverance. Let my readers, however, consider whether this verse may
   not be taken simply as the words stand in the original. The preposition
   until is not expressed by the prophet, who merely says, I will keep the
   end. "Lord, I have need of constant teaching, that I may not fall short
   of, but keep my eye continually upon my mark; for thou commandest me to
   run in thy course, on condition that death alone should be the goal.
   Unless thou teach me daily, this perseverance will not be found in me.
   But if thou guide me, I will be constantly upon the watch, and will
   never turn away my eyes from my end, or aim." In my version I have
   inserted the commonly received reading.

   34. Make me to understand We are here informed that true wisdom
   consists in being wise according to the law of God, that it may
   preserve us in fear and obedience to him. In asking God to confer this
   wisdom upon him, he owns that men, in consequence of their natural
   blindness, aim at anything rather than this. And, indeed, it is quite
   foreign to the notions usually prevalent among mankind to strain every
   nerve to keep God's law. The world esteems as wise those only who look
   well to their own interests, are acute and politic in temporal matters,
   and who even excel in the art of beguiling the simple. In opposition to
   such a sentiment, the prophet pronounces men to be void of true
   understanding as long as the fear of God does not predominate among
   them. For himself he asks no other prudence than the surrendering of
   himself entirely to God's direction. At the same time, he acknowledges
   this to be the special gift of God, which none can procure by his own
   power or policy; for were each adequate to be his own teacher in this
   matter, then this petition would be superfluous.

   Moreover, as the observance of the law is no common occurrence, he
   employs two terms in reference to it. "Lord, it is a high and hard
   thing to keep thy law strictly as it ought, which demands from us
   purity beyond what we are able to attain; yet, depending on the
   heavenly illumination of thy Spirit, I will not cease my endeavors to
   keep it." The following, however, renders the meaning more clear: "Give
   me understanding to keep and observe thy law with my whole heart."
   Mention is made of the whole heart, to tell us how far they are from
   the righteousness of the law who obey it only in the letter, doing
   nothing deserving of blame in the sight of men. God puts a restraint
   principally on the heart, that genuine uprightness may flourish there,
   whose fruits may afterwards appear in the life. This spiritual
   observance of the law is a most convincing evidence of the necessity of
   being divinely prepared and formed for it.

   35. Direct me in the path The frequent repetition of this phraseology
   by the prophet is not to be considered as redundant. Seeing that the
   end of man's existence ought to consist in profiting in God's school,
   we nevertheless perceive how the world distracts him by its
   allurements, and how he also forms for himself a thousand avocations
   calculated to withdraw his thoughts from the main business of his life.
   The next clause of the verse, in it I take pleasure, must be carefully
   attended to. For it is an indication of rare excellence when a person
   so arranges his sentiments and affections as to renounce all the
   enticements pleasant to the flesh, and take delight in nothing so much
   as in the service of God. The prophet had already attained to this
   virtue but he still perceives that he is not yet perfect. Therefore,
   that his desire may be fully accomplished, he solicits fresh assistance
   from God, according to the saying of Paul,

   "It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good
   pleasures" Philippians 2:13.

   Let it be remembered, that he does not boast of the inherent working of
   his nature, but sets forth the grace he has received, that God may
   complete the work he has begun. "Lord, thou hast given me courage,
   grant me also strength." Hence in the term pleasure there is an implied
   opposition to the lusts of the flesh, which keep the hearts of mankind
   lettered by their enticements.

   36. Incline my heart In this verse he confesses the human heart to be
   so far from yielding to the justice of God, that it is more inclined to
   follow an opposite course. Were we naturally and spontaneously inclined
   to the righteousness of the law, there would be no occasion for the
   petition of the Psalmist, Incline my heart It remains, therefore, that
   our hearts are full of sinful thoughts, and wholly rebellious, until
   God by his grace change them. This confession on the part of the
   prophet must not be overlooked, That the natural corruption of man is
   so great, that he seeks for any thing rather than what is right, until
   he be turned by the power of God to new obedience, and thus begin to be
   inclined to that which is good.

   In the second clause of the verse the prophet points to those
   impediments which prevent mankind from attaining to the desire of
   righteousness; their being inclined to covetousness. By a figure of
   speech, [412] in which a part is put for the whole, the species is put
   for the genus. The Hebrew term, vts batsang, signifies to use violence,
   or to covet, or to defraud; but covetousness is most in accordance with
   the spirit of the passage, provided we admit the prophet to have
   selected this species, "the root of all evils," to demonstrate that
   nothing is more opposed to the righteousness of God, (1 Timothy 6:10).
   We are here instructed generally, that we are so much under the
   influence of perverse and vicious affections, our hearts abhor the
   study of God's law, until God inspire us with the desire for that which
   is good.

   37. Turn away mine eyes. By these words we are taught that all our
   senses are so filled with vanity, that, until refined and rectified,
   their alienation from the pursuit of righteousness is no matter of
   surprise. In the former verse he informed us of the reigning of that
   depravity in the hearts of men, which he now says reaches also to the
   outward senses. "The disease of covetousness not only lurks in our
   hearts, but spreads over every part, so that neither eyes, ears, feet,
   nor hands, have escaped its baneful influence; in a word, nothing is
   exempted from corruption." And we know, assuredly, that the guilt of
   original sin is not confined to one faculty of man only; it pervades
   his whole constitution. If our eyes must be turned away from vanity by
   the special grace of God, it follows, that, as soon as they are opened,
   they are eagerly set on the impostures of Satan, by which they are
   beset on all sides. If Satan only laid snares for us, and were we
   possessed of sufficient prudence to guard against his deceits, it could
   not, with propriety, be said that God turned away our eyes from vanity;
   but, as they are naturally set upon sinful allurements, there is need
   for their being withdrawn from them. As often, then, as we open our
   eyes, we must not forget that two gates are opened for the devil to
   enter our hearts, unless God guard us by his Holy Spirit. The remarks
   which he makes, in reference to the eyes, are equally applicable to the
   other senses, inasmuch as he again employs that figure of speech, by
   which a part is taken for the whole.

   The other clause of the verse corresponds well with the meaning here
   given. Others may propose different interpretations; I think, however,
   the following is the most natural: Lord, as the whole life of mankind
   is accursed, so long as they employ their powers in committing sin,
   grant that the power which I possess may aspire after nothing except
   the righteousness which thou appointest us. The better to manifest
   this, we must lay it down as a first principle, that seeing, hearing,
   walking, and feeling, are God's precious gifts; that our understandings
   and will, with which we are furnished, are a still more valuable gift;
   and, after all, there is no look of the eyes, no motion of the senses,
   no thought of the mind, unmingled with vice and depravity. Such being
   the case, the prophet, with good reason, surrenders himself entirely to
   God, for the mortification of the flesh, that he might begin to live
   anew.

   38. Confirm thy word unto thy servant. Here we have briefly set forth
   the sole end and legitimate use of prayer, which is, that we may reap
   the fruits of God's promises. Whence it comes to pass, that they commit
   sin who utter vague and incoherent desires. For we perceive the prophet
   allows not himself to petition or wish any thing but what God hath
   condescended to promise. And certainly their presumption is great, who
   rush into the presence of God without any call from his word; as if
   they would make him subservient to their humor and caprice. The
   argument by which the Psalmist enforces his plea deserves to be
   noticed; because I am devoted to thy fear. The relative 'sr asher, in
   this place bears the signification of the causal conjunction, because
   or for. The prophet intimates that he does not content himself with
   mere temporal enjoyments, as worldly men do; and that he did not make a
   preposterous abuse of God's promises, to secure the delights of the
   flesh, but that he made his fear and reverence his aim. And truly the
   best assurance which we can have of obtaining our requests is when
   these and God's service harmonize, and our sole desire is that he may
   reign in and over us.

   39. Take away my reproach. It is not certain to what reproach he
   alludes. Knowing that many calumniators were on the watch to find
   occasion for reviling him, should they happen to detect him in any
   offense, it is not without reason he dreaded lest he might fall into
   such disgrace, and that by his own fault. Probably he might be
   apprehensive of some other reproach, aware that wicked men shamefully
   and injuriously slander the good generally, and, by their calumnies,
   distort and pervert their good actions. The concluding clause, Because
   the judgments of God are good, is the reason why God should put to
   silence the mischievous tongues, which pour out the venom of their
   malice without shame against the innocent, who are reverently observing
   his law. If any be inclined to view the word reproach as directed
   against God himself, such an interpretation is by no means
   objectionable, That the prophet, whose aim it was to stand approved as
   to his life in God's sight, merely desired, when he appeared before his
   tribunal, not to be judged as a reprobate man; just as if, with great
   zeal and magnanimity, he would despise all the empty talk of the men of
   the world, provided he stood upright in God's sight. Above all, it
   becomes holy men to dread the reproach of being suffused with shame at
   God's judgment-seat.

   40. Behold, I have a desire to thy precepts This is a repetition of
   what he declared a little before, with regard to his pious affection,
   and his love of righteousness; and that nothing was wanting but God to
   complete the work which he had commenced. If this interpretation be
   admitted, then, to be quickened in the righteousness of God, will be
   tantamount to being quickened in the way. The term righteousness is
   often put in this psalm for the law of God, or the rule of a righteous
   life. This view tends to make the two parts of the verse accord with
   one another. "Lord, this is now a remarkable kindness thou hast done
   me, in having inspired me with a holy desire to keep thy law; one thing
   is still necessary, that this same virtue pervade my whole life." But
   as the word righteousness is ambiguous, my readers may, if they choose,
   understand it thus: Restore, defend, and maintain me for the sake of
   thy goodness, which thou art wont to show to all thy people. I have
   already pointed out the exposition which I prefer.

   statutes. v 46. And I will speak of thy testimonies before kings, and
   will not be ashamed. v 47. And I will delight myself in thy
   commandments, which I have loved. v 48. And I will lift up my hands to
   thy statutes, which I have loved, and will meditate on thy precepts.


   41. Let thy mercies come to me There can be no doubt, that, in
   mentioning the mercy of God first, and afterwards his salvation, the
   Psalmist, according to the natural order, puts the cause before the
   effect. By adopting this arrangement, he acknowledges that there is no
   salvation for him but in the pure mercy of God. And while he desires a
   gracious salvation, he, at the same time, relies on the promise, as we
   have already elsewhere seen.

   In the second verse he boasts that he is furnished with the best
   defense against the calumnies of his enemies, arising from his trust in
   the word of God. We may resolve the future tense into the optative
   mood, as many do: O Lord, since I have trusted in thy word, grant that
   my mouth with all boldness may repel the slanders which they utter
   against me, and suffer me not to be silent when they load me with
   unmerited reproach." Whichever of these meanings we adopt, we are
   taught that there will always be evil-speakers, who will not cease to
   defame the children of God, though they be entirely undeserving of such
   treatment. It is somewhat dubious to what particular kind of reproach
   he refers; for the ungodly not only cover the children of God with
   ignominy, but also make their faith the subject of ridicule. I prefer
   the following interpretation, because it agrees best with the context,
   and David is here placing his trust in God in opposition to their
   derision. "I shall have something to reply to the base mockery of the
   enemies who injure me without cause, in that God never disappoints
   those who place their confidence in him." If any one be inclined to
   consider the passage as embracing both meanings, I offer no objection
   to it. Besides, he does not simply say, that he trusted in God, but
   that he also trusted in his word, which is the ground of his trust. We
   must carefully attend to the correspondence and mutual relation between
   the term word, in the first part of the verse, and that in the other.
   Were not God, by his Word, to furnish us with another word for our
   defense, we would instantly be overwhelmed with the insolence of our
   enemies. If, then, we wish to be proof against the attacks of the
   world, the commencement and foundation of our magnanimity is here
   pointed out to us, -- our trusting in God's word, guarded by which, the
   Spirit of God calls upon us boldly to contemn the virulent blasphemies
   of the ungodly. And to qualify us for repelling such blasphemies, he
   connects the word of hope with the word of confession.

   43. Take not the word of truth too long out of my mouth [414] It may be
   asked, why he demands rather to have his tongue filled with, than his
   heart fortified by, the word of truth; inasmuch as the latter takes the
   precedence, both in point of order and of excellence. What will it
   profit us to be fluent and eloquent in speech, if our hearts are
   destitute of faith? On the other hand, wherever there is firm faith,
   there to speech will flow ultroneously. My reply is, that David was not
   so concerned about outward confession as not to give the preference to
   the faith of the heart; but considering that he is making his address
   to God, there is nothing strange in his making mention only of the
   former, under which, however, he includes also the latter. "Lord,
   support not only my heart by faith, lest I be overwhelmed with
   temptation, but grant me also freedom of speech, that I may fearlessly
   sound forth thy praises among men." We observe, when he asks to be
   endued with boldness of speech, that he begins with the heart.

   It may be farther inquired here, why he says too long, just as if he
   were not afraid of being deprived of the word of truth for a short
   time. Such a supposition were most absurd, seeing we must watch every
   moment lest we be overtaken by the enemy, when we are unarmed and
   powerless. The solution of this difficulty must be drawn from our own
   experience; for in this, the infirmity of our flesh, it is almost
   impossible but that, occasionally, even the stoutest heart will quail
   under the violent assaults of Satan. And although their faith fails
   not, yet it shakes, and they do not find such presence of mind, as that
   there is constantly a uniform train of speech, and a prompt reply to
   the derision's of the ungodly; but, on the contrary, they rather begin
   to stagger and quake for a short time. Conscious of this weakness,
   which is perceptible in all mankind, he accommodates his prayer in the
   following manner: "Though I am not always prepared with that boldness
   of speech which is desirable, suffer me not to continue long silent."
   By this language the prophet tacitly admits, that he had not been so
   steadfast and bold as was requisite, but that he was, as it were,
   struck speechless by reason of fear. Whence we may learn, that the
   faculty of speaking freely is no more in our power than are the
   affections. of the heart. As far, then, as God directs our tongues,
   they are prepared for ready utterance; but no sooner does he withdraw
   the spirit of magnanimity, than not only our hearts faint, or rather
   fail, but also our tongues become mute. The cause of this is subjoined
   in these words, for I have waited for thy judgments for so he literally
   expresses himself. From which we conclude, that judgments refer not
   merely to the precepts of the law, but also to the promises, which
   constitute the true foundation of our confidence. Some render it, I was
   afraid of thy. judgments, deriving the word here employed from the root
   chvl chul; which translation I am unable to say whether it be suitable
   or not. But of this I am certain, that to understand judgments as
   equivalent to punishments, is quite foreign to the design of the
   prophet.

   44. I will keep thy law continually He resolves to devote himself to
   the study of the law, not for a short time only, but even to the
   termination of his life. The employing of three synonymous words, tmyd,
   tamid, vlm, olam, d, ed, so far from being viewed as a superfluous
   accumulation of terms, contains an implied indication, that, unless the
   faithful make a strenuous and steady opposition, the fear of God may be
   gradually effaced from their minds by various temptations, and they
   will lose the affection which they bear for the law. In order,
   therefore, that he may be the better prepared for meeting these trials,
   he alludes to the difficulty and danger connected with them.

   The next verse may be read as expressing a desire that he might walk.
   Be this as it may, we retain the commonly received reading, That David
   exults at the thought of his path becoming plain and easy, in
   consequence of his seeking diligently after God's precepts; that is, to
   walk at ease The ways of men are frequently rugged and obstructed,
   because they themselves lay various stumblingblocks in them, or
   entangle themselves in many inextricable windings. Hence it comes to
   pass, that while none will submit to the word of God as their rule,
   every man endures the punishment legitimately due to such arrogance. On
   all sides God lays snares for us, puts pitfalls in our way, causes us
   to fall in with paths broken and rugged, and at last shuts us up in a
   bottomless pit: and by how much the more politic a mart is, by so much
   the more will he meet with obstructions in his path.

   This verse teaches us that, if any man yield implicit obedience to God,
   he will receive this as his reward, that he shall walk with a calm and
   composed mind; and should he meet with difficulties, he will find the
   means of surmounting them. The faithful, however readily and
   submissively they give themselves up to God, may happen to find
   themselves involved in perplexity; nevertheless, the end contemplated
   by Paul is accomplished, that though they be in trouble and toil, yet
   they do not continue in irremediable distress, because it is the duty
   (so to speak) of God to point out a way for them where there seems to
   be no way, (2 Corinthians 4:8.) Moreover, when grievously oppressed,
   even then they walk at ease, for they commit the doubtful issue of
   events to God in such a manner, that, having him for their guide, they
   have no doubt they will come out boldly from the depths of distress.

   46. And I will steal, of thy testimonies before kings [415] In these
   words he seems to believe that he is in possession of that which he
   formerly prayed for. Having said, "Take not away the word out of my
   mouths" and now, as if he had obtained what he requested, he rises up,
   and maintains he will not be dumb, even were he called upon to speak in
   the presence of kings. There can be no question that he affirms he
   would willingly stand forward in vindication of the glory of God in the
   face of the whole world. He selects kings, who are generally more to be
   dreaded than other men, and haughtily shut the mouths of God's
   witnesses. Sometimes, indeed, it happens we will not hold out even in
   the presence of men in the humblest ranks of life. The moment a man
   sets himself in opposition to the word of God, we instinctively shrink
   back from fear; and that boldness of speech, of which we boasted at
   first, instantly disappears: but our want of courage is most palpable
   when we are summoned before the thrones of kings. And this is the
   reason why David asserts, that he will not only hold out against
   enemies among the meanest of men, but also will remain firm and
   fearless before kings. These words inform us that we have profited well
   and truly by God's word, when our hearts are so completely fortified
   against the fear of man, that we do not dread the presence of kings,
   even though all the world attempts; to fill us with dejection and
   dismay. It is most unbecoming that God's glory should be obscured by
   their empty splendor.

   47. And I will delight myself The sentiment contained in this verse is
   similar to that which he had previously mentioned. The amount is, he
   held the commandments of God in such high esteem, that he experienced
   nothing more pleasant to him than the making of them his constant theme
   of meditation. By the term delight, he expresses the intensity of his
   love. The phrase I will lift up my hands, refers, to the same thing. It
   is a sure indication that we eagerly desire a thing when we stretch out
   the hands to grasp and enjoy it. This simile, therefor denotes the
   ardor of his desire. [416] If a man, by his mien and gait pretend any
   such affection for the law of God, and yet pay no regard to it in the
   affairs of life, he would be justly chargeable with the basest
   hypocrisy. Again, he affirms, that that affection, so earnest and so
   ardent, springs from the sweetness of the law of God having knit our
   hearts to it. Finally, he says, he would meditate on God's testimonies.
   Along with the majority of commentators, I have no doubt that the word
   svch shuach, denotes that silent and secret musing in which the
   children of God exercise themselves.

   [414] "O take not, etc. This verse seems to admit of either of the two
   following interpretations: Suffer me not to desist utterly from making
   an open profession of true religion; for I wait for thy promises:' or,
   Suffer me not to be reproached with falsehood, (for having asserted
   that thou wouldest take vengeance on the wicked,) because I have looked
   for thy judgments,' i.e., thy penal judgments. Calvin favors the former
   interpretation, the latter is Le Clerc's." -- Cresswell. Walford, by
   word, understands the answer that the Psalmist had to make to the
   accusations of his enemies: and observes, "This answer, which asserted
   his innocence of the crimes with which they charged him, he declares to
   be altogether true; and he entreats that God, as a judge, would not
   suffer him to be deprived of the benefit of that answer, but pronounce
   a righteous sentence between them."

   [415] "Dr Delaney supposes that this is spoken in reference to Achish,
   king of Gath, whom David had instructed in the Jewish religion: but we
   have already seen that it is most likely that the psalm was compiled
   under the Babylonish captivity. But the words may, with more propriety,
   be referred to the case of Daniel, and other bold and faithful
   Israelites, who spoke courageously before Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar,

   "I will reach out my hands with eagerness, in order to receive thy

   Psalm 119:49-56

   z 49. Remember thy word to thy servant, I, which thee hast made him
   hope. z 50. This is my consolation in my affliction, because thy word
   revives me. z 51. The proud have greatly scorched me: I have not turned
   aside from thy law. z 52. I called to mind thy judgments of old, O
   Jehovah! and comforted myself. z 53. Terror seized me, for' the wicked
   who forsake thy law. z 54. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house
   of my pilgrimage. z 55. By night I remembered thy name, O Jehovah! and
   I kept, thy law. z 56. This is done to me, because I have kept thy
   statutes.


   49. Remember thy word. He prays that God would really perform what he
   promised; for the event proves that he does not forget his word. That
   he is speaking of the promises we infer from the end of the verse, in
   which he declares, that cause was given him to hope, for which there
   would be no place unless grace had been presented to him. In the second
   verse he asserts, that though God still kept him in suspense, yet he
   reposed with confidence in his word. At the same time he informs us,
   that during his troubles and anxieties, he did not search after vain
   consolation as the world is wont to do who look around them in all
   quarters to find something to mitigate their miseries; and if any
   allurements tickle their fancy, they make use of these as a remedy for
   alleviating their sorrows. On the contrary, the prophet says he was
   satisfied with the word of God itself; and that when all other refuges
   failed him, there he found life full and perfect; nevertheless, he
   covertly confesses, that if he do not acquire courage from the word of
   God, he will become like a dead man. The ungodly may sometimes
   experience elevation of spirit during their miseries, but they are
   totally destitute of this inward strength of mind. The prophet, then,
   had good reason for stating, that in the time of affliction the
   faithful experience animation and rigor solely from the word of God
   inspiring them with life,. Hence, if we meditate carefully on his word,
   we shall live even in the midst of death, nor will we meet with any
   sorrow so heavy for which it will not furnish us with a remedy. And if
   we are bereft of consolation and succor in our adversities, the blame
   must rest with ourselves; because, despising or overlooking the word of
   God, we purposely deceive ourselves with vain consolation.

   51. The proud have greatly scorned me This example is eminently useful,
   as it serves to inform us, that though our honesty may render us
   obnoxious to the insults of the ungodly, we ought, by our unflinching
   constancy, to repel their pride, lest we should take a dislike to the
   law of God. Many who, in other respects, would be disposed to fear God,
   yield to this temptation. The earth has always been filled with the
   impious contemners of God, and at this day it is almost overrun with
   them. Wherefore, if we do not disregard their reviling, there will be
   no stability in our faith. In calling unbelievers proud, he applies to
   them a very appropriate designation: for their wisdom consists in
   despising God, lightly esteeming his judgments, trampling all piety
   under foot, and, in short, pouring contempt upon the celestial kingdom.
   Were they not blinded with pride, they would not follow such a headlong
   course. We must interpret the words in this manner: Though the proud
   have treated me with scorn, I have not turned aside from thy law. We
   must not overlook the,, particle very much, or greatly, which imports,
   that he was harassed, not merely occasionally or for a short time, by
   the ungodly, but that the attack was continued from day to day. Let us
   learn from these words, that the wicked, in consequence of their
   forming the great majority of mankind, arrogate to themselves the
   greater liberty. The number of the godly who worship God reverently is
   always small. Hence we must hold out against a large troop and rabble
   of the impious if we would maintain our integrity.

   52. I called to mind thy judgments of old, O Jehovah! In this psalm,
   the judgments of God are generally taken for his statutes and decrees,
   that is, his righteousness. [417] In this place, in consequence of the
   qualifying phrase, of old, it is more probable that they refer to the
   examples by which God has made himself known as the righteous Judge of
   the world. Why does he say that the law of God has been from
   everlasting? This may to some extent be accounted for from the
   righteousness here mentioned not being of recent growth, but truly
   everlasting, because the written law is just an attestation of the law
   of nature, through means of which God recalls to our memory that which
   he has previously engraved on our hearts.

   I am rather inclined to adopt another interpretation, That David
   remembered the judgments of God, by which he testified that he had
   established his law perpetually in the world, Such a settlement is very
   necessary for us; because, when God does not make bare his arm, his
   word frequently produces little impression. But when he takes vengeance
   upon the ungodly, he confirms what he had spoken; and this is the
   reason why in civil law penalties are called confirmations. The term
   accords better with God's judgments, by which he establishes the
   authority of his law, as if a true demonstration accompanied his words.
   And seeing he declares that he called to mind the most ancient of God's
   judgments, it becomes us to learn, that if his judgments are not
   displayed as frequently as we would desire, for the strengthening of
   our faith, this is owing to our ingratitude and apathy; for in no past
   age have there been wanting clear demonstrations for this very purpose;
   and thus it may with truth be affirmed, that God's judgments have
   flowed in one continued manner from age to age, and that the reason why
   we have not perceived them is, our not deigning to open our eyes to
   behold them. If any one object, that it is contrary to the nature of
   his judgments to afford consolation to because they are calculated
   rather to strike us with terror, the answer is at handy -- that the
   faithful are made to tremble for fear of God's judgments, as far as is
   requisite for the mortification of their flesh. On the other hand,
   these supply them with a large source of consolation, from the fact of
   their learning from them, that God exercises his superintending
   providence over the human race. Farther, they learn, that after the
   wicked have reveled in licentiousness for a season, they shall at
   length be sisted before the judgment-seat of God; but that they
   themselves, after having patiently combated under such a Guardian of
   their welfare, can be in no doubt about their preservation.

   53. Terror seized me [418] This verse may be understood in two senses;
   either that the prophet was grievously afflicted when he saw God's law
   violated by the wicked, or that he was horror-struck at the thought of
   their perdition. Some would render it ardor, which does not so properly
   agree with the nature of the passage; I therefore abide by the term
   fear, by which I think his ardent zeal is pointed out, in that he was
   not only deeply grieved at the transgressions of the law, but held in
   the utmost detestation the impious boldness of those who lightly
   esteemed the law of God. At the same time, it is worthy of notice, that
   it is no new ground of offense to the faithful, if numbers throw off
   God's yoke, and set up the standard of rebellion against him. This, I
   repeat, must be attended to, because many derive flimsy and frivolous
   pretexts for it, from the degeneracy of the age, as if they must needs
   howl while they live among wolves. In the days of David, we see there
   were many who apostatized from the faith, and yet, so far was he from
   being discouraged or dismayed by these things, that the fear of God
   rather kindled a holy indignation in his bosom. What is to be done,
   then, when surrounded by bad examples, but that we should vie with each
   other in holding them up to detestation? And here a contrast, if not
   directly stated, is implied, between the flattering unction which we
   apply to ourselves, believing that all is lawful which is common, and
   the horror with which the prophet tells us he was seized. If the
   wicked, haughtily and without restraint, set themselves in opposition
   to God, in consequence of our not being alive to his judgments, we
   convert that into an occasion of perverse confidence and insensibility.
   On the contrary, the prophet asserts that he was seized with horror,
   because, though he considered the long-suffering of God, on the one
   hand, yet, on the other, he was fully persuaded that he must, sooner or
   later, call for condign punishment.

   54. Thy statutes have been my songs. [419] He repeats in different
   words what he had formerly mentioned, that the law of God was his sole
   or special delight during all his life. Singing is an indication of
   joy. The saints are pilgrims in this world, and must be regarded as
   God's children and heirs of heaven, from the fact that they are
   sojourners on earth. By the house of their pilgrimage, then, may be
   understood their journey through life. One circumstance merits
   particular notice, that David, during his exile from his native
   country, ceased not to draw consolation, amid all his hardships, from
   the law of God, or rather a joy which rose above all the sadness which
   his banishment occasioned to him. It was a noble specimen of rare
   virtue, that when he was denied a sight of the temple, could not draw
   near to the sacrifices, and was deprived of the ordinances of religion,
   he yet never departed from his God. The phrase, the house of his
   pilgrimage, is employed, therefore, to enhance the conduct of David,
   who, when banished from his country, still retained the law of God
   deeply engraved on his heart, and who, amid the severity of that exile,
   which was calculated to deject his spirits, cheered himself by
   meditating upon the law of God.

   55. By night I remembered thy name, O Jehovah! As the second clause of
   the verse depends on the first, I consider the whole verse as setting
   forth one and the same truth; and, therefore, the prophet means that he
   was induced, by the remembrance he had of God, to keep the law.
   Contempt of the law originates in this, that few have any regard for
   God; and hence, the Scripture, in condemning the impiety of men,
   declares that they have forgotten God, (Psalm 50:22; 78:11; 106:21). To
   rectify this, David exhorts that the remembrance of God is the only
   remedy for preserving us hi his fear, and in the observance of his law;
   and assuredly, as often as his majesty occurs to our minds, it will
   tend to humble us, and the very thought of it will provoke us to the
   cultivation of godliness. The word night is not intended by him to mean
   the remembering of God merely for, short time, but a perpetual
   remembrance of him; he, however, refers to that season in particular,
   because then almost all our senses are overpowered with sleep. "When
   other men are sleeping, God occurs to my thoughts during my sleep." He
   has another reason for alluding to the night-season, That we may be
   apprised, that though there was none to observe him, and none to put
   him in remembrance of it, -- yea, though he was shrouded in darkness,
   -- yet he was as solicitous to cherish the remembrance of God, as if'
   he occupied the most public and conspicuous place.

   56. This was done to me. I doubt not that the prophet, under the term
   z't, zoth, comprehends all God's benefits; but as he comes before God
   in relation to blessings then being enjoyed by him, he speaks as if he
   were pointing to them. Hence, under this term is included an
   acknowledgment of all the benefits with which he had been crowned; or,
   at all events, he declares that God had borne testimony, by some signal
   deliverance, to the integrity of his conduct. He does not boast of
   meriting any thing, as the Pharisees in our day do, who, when they meet
   with any such matter in Scripture, pervert it to prove the merit of
   works. But the prophet had no other design, than to set himself in
   diametrical opposition to the despisers of God, who either impute all
   their prosperity to their own industry, or ascribe it to chance, and
   malignantly overlook or conceal God's superintending providence. He
   therefore calls upon himself to return to God, and invites others to
   follow his example, and exhorts them, that as God is an impartial
   judge, he will always reserve a recompense for piety. Probably, too, by
   this holy boasting he repels the base slanders of the ungodly, by which
   we lately saw he was grievously assailed.

   [418] The Hebrew word here used for terror is zlphh, zalaphah, and is
   supposed to refer to the blasting or scorching wind, called the Simoom,
   well known to the Eastern nations. Accordingly, Michaelis reads, "A

   According to Dimock, zlphh denotes, in this place, the burning fever
   which the pestilential winds in the East occasioned. The word occurs
   only three times in Scripture; here, in Psalm 11:7, and in Lamentations
   5:10. Our translators have rendered it, in Psalm 11:7, by storm, and in

   Psalm 119:57-64

   ch 57. Thou art my portion, O Jehovah! I have said I will keep thy
   words. ch 58. I have earnestly besought thy face with my whole heart;
   have mercy upon me according to thy word. ch 59. I thought upon my
   ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. ch 60. I made haste, and
   did not delay to keep thy commandments. ch 61. The cords of the wicked
   have caught hold of me; [420] but I did not forget thy law. ch 62. I
   will rise at midnight to praise thee for thy righteous judgments. ch
   63. I am a companion to all those who fear thee, and who keep thy
   precepts. ch 64. O Jehovah! the earth is full of thy mercy; teach me
   thy statutes.


   57. Thou art my portion, O Jehovah! The meaning of this clause is
   doubtful, because the term Jehovah may be rendered either in the
   nominative or vocative case, and the phrase, I have said, may relate
   either to the former or latter part of the verse. One lection then is,
   Jehovah is my portion, and, therefore, I have resolved to observe thy
   law. Another is, O God! who art my portion, I have resolved to observe
   thy law. A third is, I have said, or have resolved, that God is my
   portion, in order to observe his law. A fourth is, I have said, or have
   resolved, O Lord! that my portion is to observe thy law; and this is
   the reading of which I approve. The following interpretation is quite
   applicable, That God being our portion, ought to animate and encourage
   us to observe his law. We have already noticed in several other
   passages, that God is denominated the heritage of the faithful, because
   he alone is sufficient for their full and entire happiness. And seeing
   he has chosen us for his peculiar possession, it is only reasonable on
   our part, that we should rest satisfied with him alone; and if we do
   this, our hearts will also be disposed to keep his law and, renouncing
   all the lusts of the flesh, our supreme delight, and firm resolution,
   will be to continue in the same.

   I have already said, that this exposition is not inconsistent with the
   scope of the passage, and that it furnishes a very useful doctrine. But
   the last and fourth reading, of which I remarked I approved, is more
   simple, -- I am fully persuaded that my best portion consists in
   keeping God's law; -- and this accords with the saying of Paul,
   "Godliness is the best gain," (1 Timothy 6:6). David here draws a
   comparison between the keeping of the law, and the imaginary good which
   captivates the ambition of mankind. "Let every one covet what seems to
   him good, and revel in his own pleasures; I have no ground to envy
   them, provided I retain this as my portion, the complete surrender of
   myself to the word of God."

   58. I have earnestly besought thy face. In this verse David asserts,
   that he still persevered in the exercise of prayer; for without prayer
   faith would become languid and lifeless. The manner in which he
   expresses himself, which, in other languages, might be unpolished,
   among the Hebrews, expresses that familiar communication to which God
   admits, and even invites his servants when they come into his presence.
   The substance of his prayers, and the sum of his desires, he
   comprehends in a single sentence; namely, that he implored the mercy of
   God, the sure hope of which he had formed from his word. Let us
   observe, then, in the first place, we are aroused from our supineness,
   that we may exercise our faith by prayer. In the second place, the
   principal thing for which we ought to pray is, that God, out of his
   free grace, may be favorable to us, look on our affection, and grant us
   relief. God does, indeed, aid us in a variety of ways, and our
   necessities also are innumerable; still the thing which we must
   principally and particularly request is, that he: will have mercy upon
   us, which is the source of every other blessing. And, in the last
   place, that we may not present prayers that have no meaning, let us
   learn that God, in all his promises, is set before us as if he were our
   willing debtor.

   59. I thought upon my ways [421] The amount is, that after the prophet
   had paid due regard to his manner of life, his only aim then was to
   follow the teaching of the law. In these words he intimates indirectly,
   that if it be inquired why men go astray, and are miserably distracted
   amidst conflicting impulses, the reason is, their thoughtlessly
   indulging themselves in the gratification of their passions. Every man
   watches most carefully, and applies all his energy to whatever his
   inclination may lead him, but all are blind in choosing the object
   which they ought to pursue; or rather, as if their eyes were sealed,
   they are either hurried away inconsiderately, or else, through
   carelessness, wander imperceptibly from one object to another. One
   thing is certain, that there is no one who carefully considers his
   ways; and, therefore, it is not without reason the prophet exhorts us,
   that the commencement of a godly life consists in men awaking from
   their lethargy, examining their ways, and, at last, wisely considering
   what it is to regulate their conduct properly. He next instructs us,
   that when a person is inclined in good earnest to frame the course of
   his life well, there is nothing better than for him to follow the
   direction which the Lord points out. In fact, were not men infatuated,
   they would universally and unanimously make choice of God to be the
   guide of their life.

   60. I made haste Though the words are in the past tense, they denote a
   continued act. The prophet declares with what promptitude he dedicated
   himself to the service of God. Diligence and dispatch demonstrate the
   favor of his zeal. Next, in saying that he delayed not, [422] this,
   according to the Hebrew idiom, gives intensity to the idea conveyed by
   the phrase, I made haste As among the Hebrews, to speak and not to keep
   silence is equivalent to speaking freely, unreservedly, and without
   dissimulation, as the occasion demands, so to make haste and not delay
   is to run quickly without doubt or delay. If we reflect on our own
   listlessness, and on the snares which Satan never fails to put in our
   way, we will at once perceive that these words are not added in vain.
   For let a man be ever so desirous of applying himself truly and
   heartily to the righteousness of God, yet, according to Paul, we know
   that "he does not the thing that he would," (Romans 7:15, 18, 19).
   Although no outward obstacle may stand in our way, yet we are so
   retarded by impediments within, that nothing is more difficult than to
   make haste to keep the law of God. At the same time we must remember,
   that the prophet is here speaking comparatively in reference to those
   who are chargeable with procrastination during the greater part of
   their life, and who draw near to God, not only hesitatingly and
   tardily, but also purposely loiter in their course, or else prevent
   themselves from coming by their tortuous ways. The prophet did not
   manifest more alacrity in serving God than Paul; all he intends,
   therefore, is, that having surmounted all obstacles which lay in his
   way, he prosecuted his journey with rapidity. And by his example he
   teaches us, that the pleas which we offer in extenuation of our
   indolence, either arising from the impediments presented by the world
   or our own infirmity, are vain and frivolous.

   61. The cords of the wicked have caught hold of me. Those who translate
   chvly, cheblei, by sorrows, bring out no natural meaning, and perplex
   themselves as well as wrest the passage. Two readings then remain,
   either of which may be admitted: The cords of the wicked have caught
   hold of me, or The companies of the wicked have robbed me. [423]
   Whether we adopt the one or the other of these readings, what the
   prophet intends to declare is, that when Satan assailed the principles
   of piety in his soul, by grievous temptations, he continued with
   undeviating steadfastness in the love and practice of God's law. Cords
   may, however, be understood in two ways; either, first, as denoting the
   deceptive allurements by which the wicked endeavored to get him
   entangled in their society; or, secondly, the frauds which they
   practiced to effect his ruin. If the first sense is preferred, David
   intimates that he had manifested a rare virtue, in continuing in the
   observance of God's law, even when the wicked seemed to have involved
   him in their nets; but as it is more generally agreed that the verb vd,
   ived, signifies to despoil or rob, let us adopt this interpretation --
   that the prophet being assailed by troops of the ungodly, and
   afterwards robbed and rifled at their pleasure, never deserted his
   ground. This was a proof of singular fortitude; for when we are exposed
   to dangers and wrongs of a more than ordinary kind, if God does not
   succour us we immediately begin to doubt of his providence: it seems to
   be of no advantage for a man to be godly; we imagine also that we may
   lawfully take revenge; and amidst these waves, the remembrance of the
   Divine law is easily lost, and, as it were, submerged. But the prophet
   assures us:, that to continue to love the law, and to practice
   righteousness, when we are exposed as a prey to the ungodly, and
   perceive no help from God, is an evidence of genuine piety.

   62 I will rise at midnight to praise thee In this verse he shows not
   only that he approved and embraced with his whole heart whatever the
   Divine law contains, but that he also gave evidence of his gratitude to
   God for having made him partaker of so great a blessing. It seems to be
   quite a common thing professedly to assent to God when he teaches us by
   his law; for who would dare to lift up his voice against Him? But still
   the world is very far from acknowledging that the truth which he has
   revealed is in all respects reasonable. In the first place, such is the
   rebellion of our corrupt nature, that every man would have somewhat
   either altered or taken away. Again, if men had their choice, they
   would rather be governed by their own will than by the word of God. In
   short, human reason, as well as human passions, is widely at variance
   with the Divine law. He then has profited not little, who both
   obediently embraces revealed truth, and, taking sweet delight in it,
   gives thanks to God for it. The prophet, however, does not simply
   declare that he magnifies God's righteous judgments; he also affirms
   that he rose at midnight to do so, by which he expresses the
   earnestness of his desire; for the studies and cares which break our
   sleep necessarily imply great earnestness of soul. He also, at the same
   time, intimates, that in bearing his testimony in behalf of the Divine
   law, he was far from being influenced by ostentation, since in his
   secret retirement, when no human eye was upon him, he pronounced the
   highest encomiums on God's righteous judgments.

   63. I am a companion to all those who fear thee He does not simply
   speak of the brotherly love and concord which true believers cultivate
   among themselves, but intimates that, whenever he met with any
   individual who feared God, he gave him his hand in token of fellowship,
   and that he was not only one of the number of God's servants, but also
   their helper. Such concord is undoubtedly required in all the godly,
   that they may contribute to each other's advancement in the fear of
   God. There seems to be a tacit comparison between this holy
   combination, by which the faithful mutually keep up and foster among
   themselves the worship of God and true godliness, and the impious
   associations which prevail every where in the world. We see how worldly
   men array their troops against God, and assist one another in their
   attempts to overthrow his worship. The more then is it necessary for
   the children of God to be stirred up to the maintenance of a holy
   unity. The Psalmist commends the faithful, first, for their fearing
   God, and, secondly, for their observing the law. The fear of God is the
   root or origin of all righteousness, and by dedicating our life to His
   service, we manifest that His fear dwells in our hearts.

   64. O Jehovah! the earth is full of thy mercy Here the prophet
   beseeches God, in the exercise of his infinite goodness, which is
   reflected in every part of the world, graciously to make him a partaker
   of the treasure of heavenly wisdom -- a manner of prayer which is very
   emphatic. When, therefore, he says that the earth is full of God's
   mercy, it is a kind of earnest entreaty. He not only magnifies the
   goodness of God, in general, (as he does in other places,) in leaving
   no part of the world devoid of the proofs of his liberality, and in
   exercising it not only towards mankind, but also towards the brute
   creation. What does he then? He desires that the mercy of God, which is
   extended to all creatures, may be manifested towards him in one thing,
   and that is, by enabling him to make progress in the knowledge of the
   Divine law. Whence we gather, that he accounted the gift of
   understanding as an inestimable treasure. Now if to be endued with the
   spirit of understanding is a chief token of God's favor, our want of
   this, proceeding from our own unbelief, is an indication of our
   alienation from him. It behooves us to remember what we have stated
   elsewhere, that it is an evidence that we have given ourselves up to
   the most shameful sloth, when, contented with a superficial knowledge
   of Divine truth, we are, in a great measure, indifferent about making
   further progress, seeing so renowned a teacher of the Church labored
   with the greatest ardor to become more and more acquainted with God's
   statutes. Besides, it is certain that he does not here treat of
   external teaching, but of the inward illumination of the mind, which is
   the gift of the Holy Spirit. The law was exhibited to all without
   distinction; but the prophet, well aware that unless he were
   enlightened by the Holy Spirit, it would be of little advantage to him,
   prays that he may be taught effectually by supernatural influence.

   Psalm 119: 65-72

   t 65. O Jehovah! thou hast done good to thud servant, according to thy
   word. t 66. Teach, thee goodness of taste and knowledge: for I have
   believed the commandments. t 67. Before I was brought low I went
   astray: but now I keep thy word. t 68. Thou art good, and doest good;
   teach me thy statutes. t 69. The proud have weaved lies against me: but
   I will keel, thy statutes with my whole heart. t 70. Their heart is fat
   as grease: but I delight in thy law. t 71. It has been good for me that
   I was affected; that I might learn thy statutes. t 72. The law of thy
   mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver.


   65. O Jehovah! thou hast done good to thy servant. Some understand this
   generally, as if the prophet protested that, in whatever way God dealt
   with him, he took it in good part, convinced that it would ultimately
   issue in his welfare; but as express mention is made of the Divine word
   or promise, the prophet, I have no doubt, celebrates the faithfulness
   of God in performing the grace which he had promised. I have really
   experienced (as if he had said) that Thou art true, and dost not delude
   thy servants with empty words. Special reference is therefore here made
   to God's promises, because thence all his benefits flow to us, not,
   indeed, as from the original fountain-head, but, as it were, by conduit
   pipes. Although his free goodness is the only cause which induces him
   to deal bountifully with us, yet we can hope for nothing at his hand
   until he first bring himself under obligation to us by his word.

   66. Teach me goodness of taste and acknowledge After having confessed
   that he had found, by experience, the faithfulness of God to his
   promises, David here adds a request similar to what is contained in the
   64th verse, namely, that he may grow in right understanding; although
   the phraseology is somewhat different; for instead of thy statutes, as
   in that verse, he here uses goodness of taste and knowledge. As the
   verb tm taam, signifies to taste, the noun which is derived from it
   properly denotes taste It is, however, applied to the mind. David,
   there is no doubt, prays that knowledge, accompanied with sound
   discretion and judgment, might. be imparted to him. Those who read,
   disjunctively, goodness and taste, mar the whole sentence. It is,
   however, necessary, in order to our arriving at the full meaning, that
   the latter clause should be added. He asserts that he believed God's
   commandments, in other words, that he cheerfully embraced whatever is
   prescribed in the law; and thus he describes himself as docile and
   obedient. As it was by the guidance of the Holy Spirit that he became
   thus inclined to obedience, he pleads that another gift may be bestowed
   upon him -- the gift of a sound taste and good understanding. Whence we
   learn, that these two things, right affection and good understanding,
   are indispensably necessary to the due regulation of the life. The
   prophet already believed God's commandments; but his veneration for the
   law, proceeding from a holly zeal, led him to desire conformity to it,
   and made him afraid, and not without cause, of inconsiderately going
   astray. Let us then learn, that after God has framed our hearts to the
   obedience of his law, we must, at the same time, ask wisdom from him by
   which to regulate our zeal.

   67. Before I was brought low I went astray As the verb nh anah,
   sometimes signifies to speak, or to testify, some adopt this rendering,
   Before I meditated upon thy statutes I went astray; but this seems too
   forced. Others go still farther from the meaning, in supposing it to
   be, that when the prophet went astray, he had nothing to say in answer
   to God. I will not stop to refute these conceits, there being no
   ambiguity in the words. David in his own person describes either that
   wantonness or rebellion, common to all mankind, which is displayed in
   this, that we never yield obedience to God until we are compelled by
   his chastisements. It is indeed a monstrous thing obstinately to refuse
   to submit ourselves to Him; and yet experience demonstrates, that so
   long as he deals gently with us, we are always breaking forth into
   insolence. Since even a prophet of God required to have his rebellion
   corrected by forcible means, this kind of discipline is assuredly most
   needful for us. The first step in obedience being the mortifying of the
   flesh, to which all men are naturally disinclined, it is not surprising
   if God bring us to a sense of our duty by manifold afflictions. Yea,
   rather as the flesh is from time to time obstreperous, even when it
   seems to be tamed, it is no wonder to find him repeatedly subjecting us
   anew to the rod. This is done in different ways. He humbles some by
   poverty, some by shame, some by diseases, some by domestic distresses,
   some by hard and painful labors; and thus, according to the diversity
   of vices to which we are prone, he applies to each its appropriate
   remedy. It is now obvious how profitable a truth this confession
   contains. The prophet speaks of himself even as Jeremiah, (Jeremiah
   31:18,) in like manner, says of himself, that he was "as a bullock
   unaccustomed to the yoke;" but still he sets before us an image of the
   rebellion which is natural to us all. We are very ungrateful, indeed,
   if this fruit which we reap from chastisements do not assuage or
   mitigate their bitterness. So long as we are rebellious against God, we
   are, in a state of the deepest wretchedness: now, the only means by
   which He bends and tames us to obedience, is his instructing us by his
   chastisements. The prophet, at the same time, teaches us by his own
   example, that since God gives evidence of his willingness that we
   should become his disciples, by the pains he takes to subdue our
   hardness, we should at least endeavor to become gentle, and, laying
   aside all stubbornness, willingly bear the yoke which he imposes upon
   us.

   The next verse needs no explanation, being nearly of the same import as
   the last verse of the former eight. He beseeches God to exercise his
   goodness towards him, not by causing him to increase in riches and
   honors, or to abound in pleasures, but by enabling him to make progress
   in the knowledge of the law. It is usual for almost all mankind to
   implore the exercise of God's goodness towards them, and to desire that
   he would deal bountifully with them, in the way of gratifying the
   diversity of the desires into which they are severally hurried by the
   inclinations of the flesh; but David protests that he would be
   completely satisfied, provided he experienced God to be liberal towards
   him in this one particular, which almost all men pass over with
   disdain.

   69. The proud have weaved [424] lies against me He declares that,
   notwithstanding the malignant interpretation which the wicked put upon
   all that he did, and their attempts, by this artifice, to turn him
   aside from following after and loving uprightness, the state of his
   mind remained unaltered. It is a severe temptation, when, although
   innocent, we are loaded with reproach and infamy, and are not only
   assailed by injurious words, but also held up to the odium of the world
   by wicked persons, under some specious pretense or other. We see many
   who otherwise are good people, and inclined to live uprightly, either
   become discouraged, or are greatly shaken, when they find themselves so
   unworthily rewarded. On this account the prophet's example is the more
   to be attended t that we may not be appalled by the malignity of men;
   that we may not cease to nourish within us the fear of God, even when
   they may have succeeded in destroying our reputation in the sight of
   our fellow-creatures; and that we may be contented to have our piety
   shining at the judgment-scat of God, although it may be defaced by the
   calumnies of men. So long as we depend upon the judgment of men, we
   will always be in a state of fluctuation, as has been already observed.
   Farther, let our works be never so splendid, we know that they will be
   of no account in the sight of God, if, in performing them, our object
   is to gain the favor of the world. Let us therefore learn to cast our
   eyes to that heavenly stage, and to despise all the malicious reports
   which men may spread against us. Let us leave the children of this
   world to, enjoy their reward, since our crown is laid up for us in
   heaven, and not on the earth. Let us disentangle ourselves from the
   snares with which Satan endeavors to obstruct us, by patiently bearing
   infamy for a season. The verb tphl, taphal, which otherwise signifies
   to join together, is here, by an elegant metaphor, taken for to weave,
   or to trim; intimating that the enemies of the prophet not only loaded
   him with coarse reproaches, but also invented crimes against him, and
   did so with great cunning and color of truth, that he might seem to be
   the blackest of characters. But though they ceased not to weave for him
   this web, he was enabled to break through it by his invincible
   constancy; and, exercising a strict control over his heart, he
   continued faithfully to observe the law of God. He applies to them the
   appellation of proud; and the reason of this, it may be conjectured,
   is, that the persons of whom he speaks were not the common people, but
   great men, who inflated with confidence in their honors and riches,
   rose up against him with so much the more audacity. He evidently
   intimates that they trampled him under their feet by their proud
   disdain, just as if he had been a dead dog.

   With this corresponds the statement in the subsequent verse (70th) that
   their heart is fat as grease, [425] -- a vice too common among the
   despisers of God. Whence is it that wicked men, whom their own
   conscience gnaws within, vaunt themselves so insolently against the
   most eminent servants of God, but because a certain grossness overgrows
   their hearts, so that they are stupefied, and even frenzied by their
   own obstinacy? But wonderful and worthy of the highest praise is the
   magnanimity of the prophet, who found all his delight in the law of
   God: it is as if he declared that this was the food on which he fed,
   and with which he was refreshed in the highest degree; which could not
   have been the case had not his heart been freed, and thoroughly
   cleansed from all unhallowed pleasures.

   71. It has been good for me that I was afflicted. He here confirms the
   sentiment which we have previously considered -- that it was profitable
   to him to be subdued by God's chastisements, that he might more and
   more be brought back and softened to obedience. By these words he
   confesses that he was not exempt from the perverse obstinacy with which
   all mankind are infected; for, had it been otherwise with him, the
   profit of which he speaks, when he says that his docility was owing to
   his being brought low, would have been merely pretended; even as none
   of us willingly submits his neck to God, until He soften our natural
   hardness by the strokes of a hammer. It is good for us to taste
   continually the fruit which comes to us from God's corrections, that
   they may become sweet to us; and that, in this way, we, who are so
   rebellious and wayward, may suffer ourselves to be brought into
   subjection.

   The last verse also requires no exposition, as it contains a sentiment
   of very frequent occurrence in this psalm, and, in itself, sufficiently
   plain, -- That he preferred God's law to all the riches of the world,
   the immoderate desire of which so deplorably infatuates the great bulk
   of mankind. He does not compare the law of God with the riches he
   himself possessed; but he affirms, that it was more precious in his
   estimation than a vast inheritance.

   [425] The fat of the human body, as physiologists inform us, is
   absolutely insensible; the lean membranous parts being those only which
   are sensitive. Accordingly, fatness of heart is used, with much

   those feelings or affections of which the heart is considered the seat.

   Psalm 119:73-80

   y 73. Thy hands have made and fashioned me: make me to understand, that
   I may learn thy commandments. y 74. They who fear thee shall see me and
   be glad; because I have hoped in thy word. y 75. I have known, O
   Jehovah! That thy judgments are justice; and thou hast humbled me in
   truth. y 76. I beseech thee let thy goodness be for my consolation,
   according to thy word to thy servant. y 77. Let thy compassion's come
   unto me, and let me live: for thy law is my delight. y 78. Let the
   proud be put to shame; for they have falsely endeavored to pervert me:
   I will meditate on thy precepts. y 79. Let such as fear thee turn unto
   me, and those who have known thy testimonies. y 80. Let my heart be
   sound in thy statutes; that I may not be put to shame.


   73. Thy hands have made and fashioned me. The avowal of the prophet,
   that he had been created by the hand of God, greatly contributed to
   inspire him with the hope of obtaining the favor which he supplicates.
   As we are the creatures and the workmanship of God, and as he has not
   only bestowed upon us vital motion, in common with the lower animals,
   but has, in addition thereto, given us the light of understanding and
   reasons -- this encourages us to pray that he would direct us to the
   obedience of his law. And yet the prophet does not call upon God, as if
   He were under any obligations to him; but, knowing that God never
   forsakes the work which he has begun, he simply asks for new grace, by
   which God may carry on to perfection what he has commenced. We have
   need of the assistance of the law, since all that is sound in our
   understandings is corrupted; so that we cannot perceive what is right,
   unless we are taught from some other source. But our blindness and
   stupidity are still more strikingly manifest, from the fact that
   teaching will avail us nothing, until our souls are renewed by Divine
   grace. What I have previously said must be borne in mind.. That
   whenever the prophet prays for understanding being imparted to him, in
   order to his learning the Divine commandments, he condemns both himself
   and all mankind as in a state of blindness; for which the only remedy
   is the illumination of the Holy Spirit.

   74. They who fear thee shall see me and be glad. This verse is either
   connected with the preceding, or it includes other benefits of God,
   besides the blessing mentioned in that verse. Whether the Psalmist
   adverts only to one particular species of blessing, or speaks
   generally, he by these words highly extols the benefits with which God
   had honored him, that all genuine saints in common might experience joy
   on that account. He does not mean to say that this joy proceeds solely
   from the trust which he reposed in God, but that it also proceeds from
   this, -- that, having been preserved by him in a remarkable way, and
   loaded with many benefits, his hope had received an ample reward. As
   God invites all his servants in common to trust in him, it follows,
   that, whenever he exhibits a token of his grace towards any one of
   them, he testifies to all that he is faithful to his promises, and that
   they have no reason to be afraid of his disappointing those who trust
   in him.

   75 I have known, O Jehovah / that thy judgments are justice. By
   judgments, in this psalm, we are to understand the precepts of the law;
   but as the prophet immediately adds, that he was justly chastised, he
   seems to use the word in this verse, for the punishments by which God
   stirs up men to repentance. These two words, tsdq, tsedek, justice, in
   the first clause, and 'mvnh emunah truth, in the last, have here nearly
   the same signification. In the first clause, the prophet confesses in
   general that God so regulates his judgments, as to shut the mouths of
   the ungodly, should any of them complain of his cruelty or rigor; and
   that such equity shines forth in them, as to extort from us the
   confession that nothing is better for men than in this way to be called
   back to the consideration of themselves. He next exhibits an example of
   this in his own person. Even hypocrites sometimes yield God the praise
   of justice when he chastises others, and they never condemn his
   severity, so long as they themselves are spared. But it is the property
   of true piety to be less austere and rigid censors of the faults of
   others than of our own. The knowledge of which the prophet speaks, is a
   sure evidence of his having made a strict and earnest examination of
   himself; for, had he not well weighed his own guilt, he could not by
   assured experience have learned the righteousness of God in his
   afflictions. If it is considered preferable to take the word judgments
   in its usual acceptation, the meaning of the text will be: Lord, I know
   that thy law is holy and just, and severely as thou hast afflicted me,
   I still retain the persuasion of this truth; for even in my afflictions
   I discern the righteousness, which corresponds with the character of
   thy word.

   76 I beseech thee let thy goodness be for my consolation. Although he
   has acknowledged that he had been justly humbled, yet he desires that
   his sorrow may be alleviated by some consolation. He implores God's
   mercy, as what was essentially necessary to relieve and cure his
   miseries. He thus shows that nothing can remove sorrow from the
   faithful, until they feel that God is reconciled to them. In the Word
   in which God offers his mercy, there is to be found no small comfort
   for healing all the grief to which men are liable. But the Psalmist is
   now speaking of actual mercy, if I may use that term, when God by the
   very deed declares the favor which he has promised. Confiding in the
   Divine promise, he already cherished in his heart a joy, proceeding
   from the hope of receiving the communications of Divine grace. But as
   all our hope would end in mere disappointment, did not God at length
   appear as our deliverer, he requests the performance of that which God
   had promised him. Lord, as if he had said, since thou hast graciously
   promised to be ready to succor me, be pleased to make good thy word in
   effect. The observation which I have previously made ought to be
   remembered, That it is not in vain to remind God of his promise. It
   would be presumption for men to come into His presence, did he not, of
   his own mere good pleasure, open up the way for them. When the Psalmist
   says, to thy servant, he does not claim God's mercy exclusively to
   himself, as if it had. been promised to him alone by some special
   oracle; but he applies to himself what God has promised to the whole
   Church, which it is the peculiar province of faith to do; for unless I
   believe that I am one of those to whom God addresses himself in his
   word, so that his promises belong to me in common with others, I will
   never have the confidence to call upon him.

   77. Let thy companions come unto me. In this verse, the Psalmist
   repeats and confirms almost the same request as in the preceding verse,
   although in phraseology somewhat different. As he had just now said,
   that his sorrow could not be removed, nor his joy restored, in any
   other way than by God's mercy being exercised towards him; so now he
   affirms that he cannot have without being reconciled to God. He thus
   distinguishes himself from worldly men, who are very little affected
   with a concern about having God reconciled to them; or, rather, who do
   not cease securely to enjoy themselves, although God is angry with
   them. He distinctly affirms, that, until he know that God is reconciled
   to him, he is a dead man even while living; but that, on the other
   hand, whenever God shall cause his mercy to shine upon him, he will be
   restored from death to life. By the way, he intimates that he was
   deprived for a time of the tokens of God's fatherly favor; for it would
   have been needless for him to have wished that it might come to him,
   had it not been removed from him. As an argument for obtaining what he
   supplicates, he asserts that the law of God was his delight; nor could
   he otherwise hope that God would be merciful to him. Besides, no man
   truly feels what virtue is in the Divine favor, but he who, placing his
   chief happiness in that alone, is convinced that all who dissever
   themselves from God are miserable and accursed; a truth which the
   prophet had learned from the law.

   78. Let the proud be put to shame. We have already often had occasion
   to remark, that, in the Hebrew language, the future tense is frequently
   used in the sense of the optative mood, as here, -- They shall be put
   to shame, for, Let them be put to shame. Still it would not be
   unsuitable to explain the meaning thus' As the proud have dealt
   mischievously with me, and molested me without a cause, the Lord will
   give them their reward. But as almost all interpreters are agreed that
   this is a prayer, in the translation of the verse I am unwilling to
   depart from the generally received explanation, especially as the
   language is expressly addressed to God himself. It is important to
   attend to the reason why the Psalmist hopes that God will be an enemy
   to his enemies; namely, because they wickedly and maliciously assaulted
   him. The word sqr, sheker, which I have rendered falsely, is by some
   translated, without a cause; but they seem only to hit upon the one
   half of the prophet's meaning; for this word, in my opinion, is to be
   referred to the stratagems and artifices by which the wicked endeavored
   to destroy David. Whence we gather, that whenever we are wrongfully
   persecuted by wicked men, we are invited to have recourse directly to
   God for protection. At the same time, we are taught that we have no
   reason to be abashed at their insolence; for, whatever power they may
   arrogate to themselves, He will beat down their loftiness, and lay it
   low, to their shame; so that, being confounded, they will serve as an
   example, to teach others that nothing is more ridiculous than to sing
   the song of triumph before the victory is gained. The verb 'sych,
   asiach, in the second clause of the verse, may be rendered, I will
   speak of, as well as I will meditate upon; implying, that, when he had
   obtained the victory, he would proclaim the goodness of God, which he
   had experienced. To speak of God's statutes, is equivalent to declaring
   out of the law, how faithfully he guards his saints, how securely he
   delivers them, and how righteously he avenges their wrongs.

   79. Let such as fear thee turn unto me. In this verse, which is
   connected with the preceding, the Psalmist affirms, that the
   deliverance which he obtained would afford common instruction to all
   the godly. My condition, as if he had said, may, for a time, have
   disheartened the righteous, as well as increased the insolence of my
   enemies; but now, taking courage, they will turn their eyes to this
   joyful spectacle. Moreover, let us learn from the two marks, by which
   he distinguishes true believers, what is the nature of genuine
   godliness. He puts the fear, or the reverence of God, in the first,
   place; but he immediately joins to it the knowledge of Divine truth, to
   teach us that these two things are inseparably connected. The
   superstitious, indeed, exhibit a fear of God of a certain kind, but it
   is a mere show, which quickly vanishes. Besides, they weary themselves
   in their own inventions to no purpose; for God will take no account of
   any other services, but those which are performed in obedience to his
   commandments. True religion, then, and the worship of God, have their
   origin in faith -- in the faith of what he has enjoined; so that no
   person can serve God aright, but he who has been taught in His school.

   80. Let my heart be sound in thy statutes Having, a little before,
   desired to be endued with a sound understanding, he now prays, in a
   similar manner, for sincere affection of heart. The understanding and
   affections, as is well known, are the two principal faculties of the
   human soul, both of which he clearly shows to be depraved and perverse,
   when he requests that his understanding may be illuminated, and, at the
   same time, that his heart may be framed to the obedience of the law.
   This plainly refutes all that the Papists babble about free will. The
   prophet not only here prays that God would help him, because his will
   was weak; but he testifies, without qualification, that uprightness of
   heart is. the gift of the Holy Spirit. We are, moreover, taught by
   these words, in what the true keeping of the law consists. A great part
   of mankind, after having carelessly framed their life according to the
   Divine law, by outward obedience, think that they want nothing. But the
   Holy Spirit here declares that no service is acceptable to God, except
   that which proceeds from integrity of heart. As to the word, tmym,
   thamim, rendered sound, we have elsewhere said, that a sound heart is
   set in opposition to a double or deceitful heart. It is as if the
   prophet had said, that those who are without dissimulation, and who
   offer to God a pure heart, yield themselves truly to Him. When it is
   added, that I may not be put to shame, it is intimated, that such shall
   be the undoubted issue as to all the proud, who, disdaining the grace
   of God, lean upon their own strength; and as to all hypocrites, who,
   for a time, parade themselves in gay colors. The amount, then, is, that
   unless God govern us by his Spirit, and keep us in the performance of
   our duty, so that our hearts may be sound in his statutes, although our
   shame may be hidden for a time, yea, although all men should praise us,
   and hold us in admiration, yet we cannot avoid falling, at length, into
   dishonor and ignominy.

   Psalm 119:81-88

   k 81. My soul hath fainted for thy salvation: I hope in thy word. k 82.
   My eyes have waxed dim in looking for thy promise, and I say, When wilt
   thou comfort me? k 83. For I have been as a bottle in the smoke; and
   yet I have not forgotten thy statutes. k 84. How many are the days of
   thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on my persecutors? k 85.
   The proud have digged pits for me, which thing is not according to thy
   law. k 86. All thy commandments are truth; they persecute we
   deceitfully; therefore help thou me. k 87. They have almost consumed me
   upon the earth; yet I have not forsaken thy statutes. k 88. Quicken me
   according to thy goodness; and I will keep the testimony of thy mouth.


   81. My soul hath fainted for thy salvation. The Psalmist intimates
   that, although worn out with continual grief, and perceiving no issue
   to his calamities, yet trouble and weariness had not produced such a
   discouraging effect upon his mind, as to prevent him from always
   reposing with confidence in God. To bring out the meaning the more
   distinctly, we must begin at the second clause, which is obviously
   added by way of exposition. There he affirms that he trusts in God; and
   this is the foundation of all. But, intending to express the invincible
   constancy of his trust, he tells us that he patiently endured all the
   distresses, under which others succumb. We see some embracing with
   great eagerness the promises of God; but their ardor, within a short
   time, vanishes; or, at least, is quenched by adversity. It was far
   otherwise with David. The verb klh, kalah, which signifies to faint, or
   to be consumed, seems, indeed, at first sight, to convey a different
   meaning. But the prophet, in this passage, as in other places, by
   fainting means that patience, which those who are deprived of all
   strength, and who seem to be already dead, continue to cherish, and
   which inspires their hearts with secret groanings, and such as cannot
   be uttered. This fainting, then, is opposed to the delicacy of those
   who cannot suffer a long delay.

   82 My eyes have waxed dim in looking for thy word This verse is very
   similar to the preceding, -- transforming to the eyes what had been
   said before concerning the soul. The only difference is, that, instead
   of longing after salvation or help, the expression, longing after God's
   word compromise, is here used; for salvation is an act, as it is
   termed; that is to say, it consists in effect, whereas a promise keeps
   us suspended in expectation. God may not, all at once, openly perform
   what he has promised; and, in this case, it being only in his word that
   he promises us help, there is no other way by which we can hope for
   help, than by our reposing on his word. As, then, the word precedes, in
   order, the help which God affords, or, rather, as it is the manner in
   which it is represented to our view, the prophet, when sighing after
   salvation, very properly declares that he kept his eyes fixed on the
   Divine word, until his sight failed him. Here we have presented to us
   the wonderful and incredible power of patience, under the infirmity of
   the flesh, when, being faint and deprived of all rigor, we have
   recourse to God for help, even while it is hidden from us. In short,
   the prophet, to prevent it from being supposed that he was too
   effeminate and faint-hearted, intimates that his fainting was not
   without cause. In asking God, When wilt thou comfort me? he shows, with
   sufficient plainness, that he was for a long time, as it were, cast off
   and forsaken.

   83. For I have been as a bottle in the smoke. [426] The particle ky,
   ki, translated for, might also, not improperly, be resolved into the
   adverb of time, when; so that we might read the verse in one connected
   sentence, thus' When I was like a dried bottle, I, nevertheless, did
   not forget thy law. The obvious design of the Psalmist is to teach us,
   that, although he had been proved by severe trials, and wounded to the
   quick, he yet had not been withdrawn from the fear of God. In comparing
   himself to a bottle or bladder, he intimates that he was, as it were,
   parched by the continual heat of adversities. Whence we learn, that
   that sorrow must have been intense which reduced him to such a state of
   wretchedness and emaciation, that like a shriveled bottle he was almost
   dried up. It, however, appears that he intends to point cut, not only
   the severity of his affliction, but also its lingering nature that he
   was tormented, as it were, at a slow fire; [427] even as the smoke
   which proceeds from heat dries bladders by slow degrees. The prophet
   experienced a long series of grief's, which might have consumed him a
   hundred times, and that, by their protracted and lingering nature, had
   he not been sustained by the word of God. In short, it is a genuine
   evidence of true godliness, when, although plunged into the deepest
   afflictions, we yet cease not to submit ourselves to God.

   84. How many are the days of thy servant? etc. Some read these two
   clauses apart, as if the first were a general complaint of the brevity
   of human life, such as is to be met with in other psalms, and more
   frequently in the book of Job; and next, in their opinion, there
   follows a special prayer of the Psalmist, that God would take vengeance
   upon his enemies. But I rather prefer joining the two clauses together,
   and limit both to David's afflictions; as if it had been said, Lord,
   how long hast thou determined to abandon thy servant to the will of the
   ungodly? when wilt thou set thyself in opposition to their cruelty and
   outrage, in order to take vengeance upon them? The Scriptures often use
   the word days in this sense; as, for example, "the days of Egypt,"
   Ezekiel 30:9; "the days of Babylon," and "the days of Jerusalem," Psalm
   137:7; a word which, in other places, is called "the day of
   visitation," Isaiah 10:3. By the use of the plural number, is denoted a
   certain determinate portion of time, which, in other places, is
   compared to the "days of an hireling," Job 14:6; Isaiah 16:14. The
   Psalmist does not, then, bewail in general the transitory life of man,
   but he complains that the time of his state of warfare in this world
   had been too long protracted; and, therefore, he naturally desires that
   it might be brought to a termination. In expostulating with God about
   his trouble, he does not do so obstinately, or with a murmuring spirit;
   but still, in asking how long it will be necessary for him to suffer,
   he humbly prays that God would not delay to succor him. As to the point
   of his stirring him up by prayer to execute vengeance, we have
   elsewhere seen in what sense it was lawful for him to make such a
   request; namely, because the vengeance which he desired to see was such
   as is properly suitable to God. It is certain that he had divested
   himself of all the corrupt affections of the flesh, that he might, with
   a pure and undisturbed zeal, desire God's judgment. He, however, in
   this passage, only wishes in general to be delivered by the hand of God
   from the wrongs which were inflicted upon him, without adjudging to
   perdition his adversaries; for he was quite contented, provided God
   appeared to defend him.

   85 The proud [428] have digged pits for me. He complains that he had
   been circumvented by the frauds and artifices of his enemies; as if he
   had said, They have not only endeavored to injure me by open force and
   the violence of the sword, but have also maliciously sought to destroy
   me by snares and secret arts. The additional clause, which thing is not
   according to thy Law, is introduced as an argument, to excite God to
   exercise his mercy; for he is the more inclined to succor his servants,
   when he sees that the attempts made upon their welfare involve the
   violation of his own Law. At the same time, the Psalmist furnishes a
   proof of his own innocence, intimating that he had deserved no such
   treatment at their hands, and that whatever they practiced, he,
   notwithstanding, patiently kept himself under restraint; not attempting
   any thing which he knew to be contrary to the Divine Law.

   86. All thy commandments are truth. In this verse he again confirms the
   statement, That, in whatever ways he was afflicted, his mind had not
   been distracted by various devices, because, trusting in the word of
   God, he never doubted of his assistance. In the first place, he tells
   us, that the consideration, by which he was armed for repelling all
   assaults, was this, That the faithful, under the conduct of God, engage
   in a prosperous warfare, the salvation which they hope for from his
   word being absolutely certain. For this reason he declares, that the
   commandments of God are true; by which encomium he teaches us, that
   those who rely upon the word of God are out of all danger; and he lays
   down this truth, that such a support may always sustain our courage. In
   the second place, he complains of the treachery of his enemies, as he
   declared before. Here the word sqr, sheker, is repeated, by which he
   means, that they had no regard to equity. From this consideration also
   he was led to entertain the hope of deliverance; for it is the peculiar
   office of God to succor the poor and afflicted who are wrongfully
   oppressed.

   87. They have almost consumed me upon the earth. He repeats, in
   somewhat different words, what he had spoken a little before, that,
   although he had been sorely tempted, he had nevertheless kept his
   footing, because he had not given up with true religion. A single
   declaration of this fact would have been enough for those who are
   perfect; but if we call to mind our own weakness, we will readily
   confess that it was not unworthy of being repeatedly stated. We not
   only forget the law of God when we are shaken by extreme conflicts, but
   the greater part lose their courage even before they engage in the
   conflict. On which account this wonderful strength of the prophet is
   worthy of more special notice, who, although almost reduced to death,
   yet never ceased to revive his courage by continual meditation on the
   law. Nor is it in vain that he adds, that it was upon the earth that
   his enemies had almost consumed him, conveying the idea, that, when the
   fears of death presented themselves to him on all sides in this world,
   he elevated his mind above the world. If faith reach to heaven, it will
   be an easy matter to emerge from despair.

   88. Quicken me according to thy goodness This verse contains nothing
   new. In the beginning of it David represents his life as depending on
   God's mercy, not only because he was conscious of human frailty, but
   because he saw himself daily exposed to death in multiplied forms, or
   rather because he was convinced, that were God's power withdrawn from
   him, he would be laid prostrate as if he were dead. He next promises,
   that when he shall be again restored to life, he will not be
   ungrateful, but will duly acknowledge this as a blessing from God, and
   that not only with the tongue, but also in his whole life. As the
   various instances in which God succors us and delivers us from dangers
   are so many new lives, it is reasonable that we should dedicate to his
   service whatever additional time is allotted to us in this world. When
   the law is called the testimony of God's mouth, by this eulogium its
   authority is very plainly asserted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [426] Bottles, among the Jews and other nations of the East, were made
   of goats' or kids' skins, as is the custom among the Eastern nations at
   this day. When the animal was killed, they cut off its feet and head,
   and drew it, in that manner, out of the skin without opening the belly.
   They afterwards sewed up the places where the legs were cut off, and
   the tail, and when it was filled, they tied it about the neck. In these
   bottles, not only water, milk, and other liquids were put, but every
   thing intended to be carried to a distance, whether dry or liquid. To
   these goat-skin vessels a reference is here undoubtedly made. The
   peasantry of Asia are in the habit of suspending them from the roof, or
   hanging them against the walls of their tents or humble dwellings: here
   they soon become quite black with smoke; for, as in their dwellings
   there are seldom any chimneys, and the smoke can only escape through an
   aperture in the roof, or by the door, whenever a fire is lighted the
   apartment is instantly filled with dense smoke. Accordingly, some
   suppose that the allusion here chiefly is to the blackness which a
   bottle contracts by hanging in the smoke; and the translators of our
   English Bible, by referring in the margin to Job 30:30, as parallel to
   this, seem to have supposed that the Psalmist refers to the blackness
   his face contracted by sorrow. "But," says Harmer, "this can hardly be
   supposed to be the whole of his thought. In such a case, would he not
   rather have spoken of the blackness of a pot, as it is supposed the
   prophet Joel does, (Joel 2:6,) rather than to that of a leather
   bottle?" -- Harmer's Observations, volume 1, page 218. When such
   bottles are suspended in the smoky tent of an Arab, if they do not
   contain liquids, or are not quite filled by the solids which they hold,
   they become dry, shrunk, and shriveled; and to this, as well as to
   their blackness, the Psalmist may allude. Long-continued bodily
   affliction and mental trouble produce a similar change on the human
   frame, destroying its beauty and strength by drying up the natural
   moisture. It has also been thought that there is a contrast between
   such mean bottles and the rich vessels of gold and silver which were
   used in the palaces of kings. "My appearance in the state of my exile
   is as different from what it was when I dwelt at court, as are the gold
   and silver vessels of a palace from the smoky skin bottles of a poor
   Arab's tent, where I am now compelled to reside." -- Ibid. and Paxton's
   Illustrations, volume 2, pages 409, 410.

   [427] "Comme a petit feu." -- Fr.

   [428] "zdym, the proud. The proud here, as well as in many other parts
   of Scripture, stands for lawless, wicked men. So the rendering of the
   LXX. Is paranomoi; Vulg. Iniqui. The relative, 'sr, is referred to
   sychvt, pits, by many persons, as Amyraldus, who thus paraphrases the
   latter part of the verse: At retia illa, cum lege tua directe pugnant.'
   Others make zdys the antecedent, of whom they consider the second
   hemistich as descriptive. The proud, who have not acted according to
   thy Law, have dug pits for me. The sense is more obvious, according to
   this latter exposition; for one does not see the force of the phrase,
   digging pits,' which are not according to God's Law, as if pits might
   be dug which are according to it." -- Phillips

   Psalm 119:89-96

   l 89. Thy word, O Jehovah! endureth for ever in heaven. l 90. Thy truth
   is from generation to generation: thou hast, established the earth, and
   it abideth. l 91. By thy judgments they continue to this day; for all
   are thy servants. l 92. Had not thy law been my delight, I had then
   perished in my affliction. l 93. I will never forget thy statutes, for
   thou hast quickened me in them. l 94. I am thine, save me; for I have
   sought thy statutes. l 95. The wicked wait for me to destroy me: but I
   consider thy testimonies. l 96. In all perfection I have see, the end:
   thy commandment is exceeding broad.


   89 Thy word, O Jehovah I endure for ever. Many explain this verse as if
   David adduced the stability of the heavens as a proof of God's truth.
   According to them the meaning is, that God is proved to be true because
   the heavens continually remain in the same state. [429] Others offer a
   still more forced interpretation, That God's truth is more sure than
   the state of the heavens. But it appears to me that the prophet
   intended to convey a very different idea. As we see nothing constant or
   of long continuance upon earth, he elevates our minds to heaven, that
   they may fix their anchor there. David, no doubt, might have said, as
   he has done in many other places, that the whole order of the world
   bears testimony to the steadfastness of God's word -- that word which
   is most true. But as there is reason to fear that the minds of the
   godly would hang in uncertainty if they rested the proof of God's truth
   upon the state of the world, in which such manifold disorders prevail;
   by placing God's truth in the heavens, he allots to it a habitation
   subject to no changes. That no person then may estimate God's word from
   the various vicissitudes which meet his eye in this world, heaven is
   tacitly set in opposition to the earth. Our salvation, as if it had
   been said, being shut up in God's word, is not subject to change, as
   all earthly things are, but is anchored in a safe and peaceful haven.
   The same truth the Prophet Isaiah teaches in somewhat different words:

   "All flesh is grass, and all the godliness thereof is as the flower of
   the field," (Isaiah 40:6.)

   He means, according to the Apostle Peter's exposition, (1 Peter 1:24)
   that the certainty of salvation is to be sought in the word, and,
   therefor that they do wrong who settle their minds upon the world; for
   the steadfastness of God's word far transcends the stability of the
   world.

   90. Thy truth is from generation to generation In this verse the
   Psalmist repeats and confirms the same sentiment. He expressly teaches,
   that although the faithful live for a short time as strangers upon
   earth, and soon pass away, yet their life is not perishable, since they
   are begotten again of an incorruptible seed. He, however, proceeds
   still farther. He had before enjoined us to pierce by faith into
   heaven, because we will find nothing in the world on which we can
   assuredly rest; and now he again teaches us, by experience, that though
   the world is subject to revolutions, yet in it bright and signal
   testimonies to the truth of God shine forth, so that the steadfastness
   of his word is not exclusively confined to heaven, but comes down even
   to us who dwell upon the earth. For this reason, it is added, that the
   earth continues steadfast, even as it was established by God at the
   beginning. Lord, as if it had been said, even in the earth we see thy
   truth reflected as it were in a mirror; for though it is suspended in
   the midst of the sea, yet it continues to remain in the same state.
   These two things, then, are quite consistent; first, that the
   steadfastness of God's word is not to be judged of according to the
   condition of the world, which is always fluctuating, and fades away as
   a shadow; and, secondly, that yet men are ungrateful if they do not
   acknowledge the constancy which in many respects marks the frame. work
   of the world; for the earth, which otherwise could not occupy the
   position it does for a single moment, abides notwithstanding steadfast,
   because God's word is the foundation on which it rests. Farther, no
   person has any ground for objecting, that it is a hard thing to go
   beyond this world in quest of the evidences of God's truth, since, in
   that case, it would be too remote from the apprehension of men. The
   prophet meets the objection by affirming, that although it dwells in
   heaven, yet we may see at our very feet conspicuous proofs of it, which
   may gradually advance us to as perfect knowledge of it as our limited
   capacity will permit. Thus the prophet, on the one hand, exhorts us to
   rise above the whole world by faith, so that the word of God may be
   found by experience to be adequate, as it really is adequate, to
   sustain our faith; and, on the other hand, he warns us that we have no
   excuse, if, by the very sight of the earth, we do not discover the
   truth of God, since legible traces of it are to be found at our feet.
   In the first clause, men are called back from the vanity of their own
   understanding; and, in the other; their weakness is relieved, that they
   may have a foretaste upon earth of what is to be found more fully in
   heaven.

   91. By thy judgments they continue to this day. The word, hyvm, hayom,
   which, following other interpreters, I have translated to this days
   might not improperly rendered daily, or every day. In that case,
   however, the sense would be substantially the same; for the prophet
   means, that the whole order of nature depends solely upon the
   commandment or decree of God. In using the term judgments, he makes an
   allusion to the law, intimating, that the same regard to rectitude
   which is exhibited in the law is brightly displayed in every part; of
   God's procedure. From this it follows, that men are very perverse,
   when, by their unbelief, they do what they can to shake and impair the
   faithfulness of God, upon which all creatures repose; and, moreover,
   when by their rebellion they impeach his righteousness, and deny the
   authority of his commands, upon which the stability of the whole world
   depends. It is a harsh manner of expression to say, that all the
   elements are God's servants; but it expresses more than if it had been
   said, that all things are ready to yield obedience to him. How can we
   account for it, that the air, which is so thin, does not consume itself
   by blowing incessantly? How can we account for it, that the waters do
   not waste away by flowing, but on the principle that these elements
   obey the secret command of God? By faith, it is true, we perceive that
   the continued existence of the world is owing to the fiat of God; but
   all who have the smallest pretensions to understanding are led to the
   same conclusion, from the manifest and undoubted proofs of this truth,
   which every where meet their eye. Let it then be thoroughly impressed
   upon our minds, that all things are so governed and maintained by the
   secret operation of God, as that their continuing in the same state is
   owing to their obeying his commandment or word. We must always remember
   the point which the prophet aims at; which is, that God's faithfulness,
   which shines forth in his external works, may gradually conduct us
   higher, until we attain such a persuasion of the truth of heavenly
   doctrine as is entirely free from doubt.

   92. Had not thy law been my delight The prophet continues to prosecute
   almost the same theme; affirming, that he would have been undone, had
   he not in his calamities sought consolation from the law of God. The
   adverb, 'z az, signifies then; but as it is sometimes used for a long
   time, it is equivalent here to long ago; unless some may prefer to
   consider it as a significant and emphatic pointing to the thing, as if
   he were still in the state which he describes. He confirms from his own
   experience what he had previously said, to make it manifest that he did
   not speak of things with which he was unacquainted, but that he asserts
   what he had really experienced, -- namely, that there is no other
   solace, and no other remedy for adversity, but our reposing upon the
   word of God, and our embracing the grace and the assurance of our
   salvation which are offered in it. He here unquestionably commends the
   very same word, which he had but now said dwelt in heaven. Though it
   resound on earth, enter into our ears, and settle in our hearts, yet it
   still retains its celestial nature; for it descends to us in such a
   manner, as that it is not subject to the changes of the world. The
   prophet declares that he was grievously oppressed by a weight of
   afflictions enough to overwhelm him; but that the consolation which he
   derived from the Divine Law in such desperate circumstances, was as
   life to him.

   93. I will never forget thy statutes. This verse contains a
   thanksgiving. As the law of the Lord had preserved him, he engages that
   he will never forget it. Yet he, at the same time, admonishes himself
   and others how necessary it is to cherish in the heart the remembrance
   of the Divine Law; for though we have found from experience its
   life-giving power, yet we easily allow it to pass from our memories,
   and on this account God afterwards justly punishes us, by leaving us
   for a long time to languish in our sadness.

   94. I am thine, save me. In the first place, he takes encouragement to
   pray from the consideration, that he is one of God's own stamp and
   coinage, as we speak. In the second place, he proves that he is God's
   from the fact of his keeping his commandments. This ought not, however,
   to be understood as if he boasted of any merit which he possessed; as,
   in dealing with men, it is customary to adduce something meritorious
   which we have done as an argument for obtaining what we desire: -- I
   have always loved and esteemed you, I have always studied to promote
   your honor and advantage; my service has always been ready at your
   command. But David rather brings forward the unmerited grace of God,
   and that alone; for no man, by any efforts of his own, acquires the
   high honor of being under the protection of God -- an honor which
   proceeds solely from his free adoption. The blessing which God had
   conferred upon him is therefore here adduced as an argument why he
   should not forsake the work which he had commenced. When he affirms,
   that he was earnestly intent upon the Divine commandments, that also
   depended upon the Divine calling; for he did not begin to apply his
   mind to God's commandments before he was called and received into his
   household. As he desires, in this verse, that the Lord would save him,
   so, in the next verse, he expresses the need he had of being saved,
   saying, that the wicked sought for him to destroy him; by which he, at
   the same time, declares the constancy of his godliness, inasmuch as he
   then set his mind upon the law of God -- a point worthy of special
   notice. Those who, at other times, would the forward and willing to
   follow God, know not to what side to turn themselves when they are
   assailed by the wicked, and, in that case, are very prone to follow
   unhallowed counsel. It is therefore a great virtue to do God the honor
   of resting contented with his promises alone, when the wicked conspire
   for our destruction, and when, to all human appearance, our life is in
   jeopardy. To consider God's testimonies is, in this place, equivalent
   to applying our minds to the word of God, which sustains us against all
   assaults, effectually allays all fears, and restrains us from following
   any perverse counsels.

   96. In all perfection, I have seen the end. [430] The prophet again,
   using other words, commends the same truth which he had taught in the
   first verse of this part -- that the word of God is not subject to
   change, because it is elevated far above the perishable elements of
   this world. He here asserts, that there is nothing under heaven so
   perfect and stable, or so complete, in all respects, as not to have an
   end; and that the Divine word alone possesses such amplitude as to
   surpass all bounds and limits. Since the verb klh kalah, signifies to
   consume and finish, as well as to make perfect, some take the noun tklh
   tichelah, for measure or end But it is necessary to translate it
   perfection, that the comparison may be the more apparent, and the
   better to amplify the faithfulness of the Divine word; the idea which
   the prophet intended to convey being, that, after he had considered all
   things, especially those which are distinguished by the greatest
   perfection, he found that they were nothing when compared with God's
   word, inasmuch as all other things will soon come to an end, whereas
   the word of God stands ever firm in its own eternity. [431] Whence it
   follows, that we have no ground for apprehending that it will forsake
   us in the midst of our course.. It is termed broad, to denote that,
   though a man may mount above the heavens, or descend into the lowest
   depths, or traverse the whole space from the right to the left hand,
   yet he will not reach farther than the truth of God conducts us. It
   remains that our minds should embrace this vast extent; and such will
   be the case when they shall have ceased to enclose and shut themselves
   up within the narrow limits of this world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [429] This is the explanation given by Walford. His translation is --
   "O Jehovah! for ever
   Is thy word established in the heavens." Upon which he observes: "The
   design of these words is by no means obvious, and the interpreters vary
   greatly in their explications. I have not met with any explanation that
   is altogether satisfactory, and shall therefore give what appears to me
   to be the true meaning. The design, in general, of the Psalmist is, to
   celebrate the immutability of the word of God: whatever He speaks is
   sure. To illustrate this position, he refers to the creation of the
   heavens and of the earth; they were alike formed by the word of God, --
   He spake, and it was done.' By virtue of that word these vast
   productions abide through all ages, so that the word of God is
   established and displayed in heaven and upon earth. As the same word
   uttered all the precepts and institutions of the law, and all the
   promises of the covenant of mercy, the unchangeableness of these
   precepts and promises is verified and manifested by the perpetual
   conservation of all these instances of physical power and energy."

   [430] "The literal translation is, to the whole of perfection I
   perceive a limit. The Hebrew word, however, which is rendered by
   perfection, occurs only in this place. It seems clearly to have for its
   root a verb signifying to complete, to finish: the meaning is, to every
   created thing, however perfect, I see a boundary;' that is, it is
   limited as to its capability, as well as to its duration." --
   Cresswell.

   [431] "All human things, however full, perfect, and admirable, are
   necessarily deficient and mutable; but the law of God, like the nature
   of him from whom it proceeds, endureth for ever, and is in all respects
   complete and unalterable. We are to understand by the law here, the
   whole revealed will of God, comprehensive of promise as well as
   precept." -- Walford.

   Psalm 119:97-104

   m 97. O how have I loved thy law! it is my meditation all the day. m
   98. Thou hast made me wiser than my adversaries by thy commandments:
   for they are ever with me. m 99. Thou hast made me to know more than
   all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my meditation. m 100. I
   excelled the aged in understanding; for I have kept thy statutes. m
   101. I have restrained my feet from every evil path, that it may keep
   thy word. m 102. I have not declined from thy judgments; for thou hast
   taught me. m 103. O how sweet/save been thy words to my palate! sweeter
   than honey to my mouth! m 104. By thy statutes I have acquired
   understanding; therefore I have hated every false way.


   97. O how have I loved thy law! Not contented with a simple
   affirmation, the prophet exclaims, by way of interrogation, that he was
   inflamed with incredible love to the law of God; and, in proof of this,
   he adds, that he was continually engaged in meditating upon it. If any
   person boasts that he loves the Divine Law, and yet neglects the study
   of it, and applies his mind to other things, he betrays the grossest
   hypocrisy; for the love of the law, and especially such an ardent love
   of it as the prophet here expresses, always produces continual
   meditation upon it. And, assuredly, unless God's law inflame and ravish
   our hearts with the love of it, many allurements will quickly steal
   upon us, and lead us away to vanity. The prophet, then, here commends
   such a love of the law, as, possessing all our senses, effectually
   excludes all the deceits and corruption's to which we are otherwise too
   much inclined.

   98. Thou hast made me wiser than my adversaries He here declares, that
   he was more learned than his adversaries, his instructors, and the
   aged, because he was a scholar of God's law. It is in a different sense
   that he describes himself as endued with understanding above his
   adversaries, from that in which he describes himself as wiser than his
   teachers. He surpassed his enemies, because their cunning and artifices
   availed them nothing when they employed these to the utmost to effect
   his destruction. The malice of the wicked is always goading them to do
   mischief; and as they are often artful and deceitful, we are afraid
   lest our simplicity should be imposed upon by their deceits, unless we
   use the same crafts and underhand dealings which they practice.
   Accordingly, the prophet glories, that he found in God's law enough to
   enable him to escape all their snares. When he claims the credit of
   being superior in knowledge to his instructors, he does not mean to
   deny that they also had learned from the word of God what was useful to
   be known. But he gives God thanks for enabling him to surpass, in
   proficiency, those from whom he had learned the first elements of
   knowledge. [432] Nor is it any new thing for the scholar to excel his
   master, according as God distributes to each man the measure of
   understanding. The faithful, it is true, are instructed by the pains
   and labor of men, but it is in such a way, as that God is still to be
   regarded as enlightening them. And it is owing to this that the scholar
   surpasses the master; for God means to show as it were, with the
   finger, that he uses the service of men in such a way as that he
   himself continues still the chief teacher. Let us therefore learn to
   commit ourselves to his tuition, that we may glory with David, that by
   his guidance we have proceeded farther than man's instruction could
   lead us. He adds the same thing respecting the aged, for the more
   abundant confirmation of his statement. Age is of great avail in
   polishing, by long experience and practice, men who, by nature, are
   dull and rude. Now the prophet asserts, that he had acquired, by the
   Divine Law, more discretion than belongs to aged men. [433] In short,
   he means to affirm, that whoever yields himself with docility to God,
   keeps his thoughts in subjection to his word, and exercises himself
   diligently in meditating upon the Law, will thence derive wisdom
   sufficient for enabling him to consult his own safety in opposition to
   the stratagems of his enemies, to exercise circumspection requisite for
   escaping their deceits; and, finally, to match with the most eminent
   masters through the whole course of his life. David, however, does not
   adduce his wisdom, that he may boast of it before the world; but, by
   his own example, he warns us, that nothing is better for us than to
   learn at God's mouth, since those only are perfectly wise who are
   taught in his school. At the same time, sobriety is here enjoined upon
   the faithful, that they may not seek for wisdom elsewhere than from
   God's word, and that ambition or curiosity may not incite them to vain
   boasting. In short, all are here recommended to behave themselves with
   modesty and humility, that no man may claim to himself such knowledge
   as elevates him above the Divine Law; but that all men, however
   intelligent, may willingly yield themselves to the lessons of heavenly
   wisdom revealed in the Divine Word. When he says, that he kept God's
   statutes, he teaches us what kind of meditation it is of which we have
   spoken, to let us know that he did not coldly philosophies upon God's
   precepts, but devoted himself to them with earnest affection.

   101. I have restrained my feet from every evil path He intimates that
   he proclaimed war against every vice, that he might wholly devote
   himself to the service of God. From this we learn the profitable
   lesson, that in order to our keeping God's Law, we must, from the
   commencement, beware lest our feet should step aside into crooked
   by-paths; for with a nature so corrupted as ours is, amidst so many
   allurements, and with minds so fickle, we are in the greatest danger of
   being led astray; yea, it is a rare miracle if any man hold on in his
   life in a right course, without turning aside in one direction or
   another. The faithful, therefore, have need to exercise the greatest
   circumspection, in order to keep their feet from going astray.

   In the next verse, David commends his own constancy in observing the
   Law. He declares that ever since he had learned from God the right
   manner of living, he had pursued the right course. As the way is so
   slippery, and our feet so feeble, and our whole disposition so prone to
   go astray after innumerable errors, no small exertions are requisite on
   our part, in order to avoid declining from God's judgments. But we must
   attend to the manner of teaching to which the Psalmist refers; for
   though all, without exception, to whom God's word is preached, are
   taught, yet scarce one in ten so much as tastes it; yea, scarce one in
   a hundred profits to the extent of being enabled, thereby, to proceed
   in a right course to the end. A peculiar manner of teaching is,
   therefore, here pointed out -- that which consists in God's drawing his
   chosen people to himself. I have been brought, as if the Psalmist had
   said, into the way of salvation, and preserved in it by the secret
   influence of the Holy Spirit.

   103. O how sweet have been thy words to my palate! He again repeats
   what he had previously stated in different words, that he was so
   powerfully attracted by the sweetness of the Divine Law, as to have no
   desire after any other delight. It is possible that a man may be
   affected with reverence towards the Law of God; but no one will
   cheerfully follow it, save he who has tasted this sweetness. God
   requires from us no slavish service: he will have us to come to him
   cheerfully, and this is the very reason why the prophet commends the
   sweetness of God's word so often in this psalm. If it is demanded in
   what sense he declares that he took such sweet delight in God's Law,
   which, according to the testimony of Paul, (1 Corinthians 3:9,) does
   nothing else but strike fear into men, the solution is easy: The
   prophet does not speak of the dead letter which kills those who read
   it, but he comprehends the whole doctrine of the Law, the chief part of
   which is the free covenant of salvation. When Paul contrasts the Law
   with the Gospel, he speaks only of the commandments and threatening.
   Now if God were only to command, and to denounce the curse, the whole
   of his communication would, undoubtedly, be deadly. But the prophet is
   not here opposing the Law to the Gospel; and, therefore, he could
   affirm that the grace of adoption, which is offered in the Law, was
   sweeter to him than honey; that is to say, that no delight was to him
   equal to this. What I have previously said must be remembered, that the
   Law of God will be unsavory to us, or, at least, that it will never be
   so sweet to us, as to withdraw us from the pleasures of the flesh,
   until we have struggled manfully against our own nature, in order to
   subdue the carnal affections which prevail within us.

   104 By thy statutes I have acquired understanding The prophet seems
   here to invert the order he has just now laid down. He observed that he
   had kept his feet from going astray, that he might observe God's Law,
   and now he institutes a contrary order, beginning with the observance
   of the Law; for he declares that he had been taught by the word of God
   before he amended his faults. Yet these two things are not
   inconsistent, -- that the faithful should withdraw themselves from
   their wanderings, in order to frame their life according to the rule of
   God's word, and that when they are already advanced a considerable way
   in a holy life, the fear of God being then more vigorous in them, they
   should regard all vices with more intense hatred. The beginning of a
   good life, unquestionably, is when a man endeavors to purge himself
   from vices; and the more a man has made progress in a good life, he
   will burn with a, proportionate zeal in his detestation of vices and in
   shunning them. Moreover, we are taught by the words of the prophet,
   that the reason why men are so involved in falsehoods, and entangled in
   perverse errors, is, because they have not learned wisdom from the word
   of God. As the whole world are given to folly, those who wander astray
   plead in excuse, that it is difficult for them to guard against the
   allurements of vice. But the remedy will be near at hand, if we follow
   the counsel of the prophet; that is to say, if, instead of leaning on
   our own wisdom, we seek understanding from the word of God, in which he
   not only shows what is right:. but also fortifies our minds, and puts
   us on our guard against all the deceits of Satan, and all the
   impostures of the world. Would to God that, at the present day, this
   were thoroughly impressed on the minds of all who boast themselves of
   being Christians; for then they would not be continually driven about,
   as the greater part of them are, with such inconstancy, according to
   the conflicting impulses of prevailing opinions. As Satan is so
   sedulously exerting himself to spread abroad the mists of error, let us
   apply ourselves with the greater earnestness to the acquisition of this
   wisdom.

   Psalm 119:105-112

   n 105. Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path. n 106. I
   have sworn, and will conform, to keep thy righteous judgments. n 107. I
   am greatly afflicted, O Jehovah! quicken me according to thy word. n
   108. O Jehovah! I beseech thee let the free-will-offerings of my mouth
   be acceptable to thee, and teach me thy judgments. n 109. My soul is
   continually in my hand; and I have not forgotten thy law. n 110. The
   wicked have laid a snare for me; and, have not erred from thy statutes.
   n 111. I have thy testimonies as an inheritance forever; for they are
   the joy of my heart. n 112. I have inclined my heart to perform thy
   statutes forever, to the end.


   105. Thy word is a lamp to my feet. In this verse the Psalmist
   testifies that the Divine Law was his schoolmaster and guide in leading
   a holy life. He thus, by his own example, prescribes the same rule to
   us all; and it is highly necessary to observe this rule; for while each
   of us follows what seems good in his own estimation, we become
   entangled in inextricable and frightful mazes. The more distinctly to
   understand his intention, it is to be noted, that the word of God is
   set in opposition to all human counsels. What the world judges right is
   often crooked and perverse in the judgment of God, who approves of no
   other manner of living, than that which is framed according to the rule
   of his law. It is also to be observed, that David could not have been
   guided by God's word, unless he had first renounced the wisdom of the
   flesh, for it is only when we are brought to do this, that we begin to
   be of a teachable disposition. But the metaphor which he uses implies
   something more; namely, that unless the word of God enlighten men's
   path, the whole of their life is enveloped in darkness and obscurity,
   so that they cannot do anything else than miserably wander from the
   right way; and again, that when we submit ourselves with docility to
   the teaching of God's law, we are in no danger of going astray. Were
   there such obscurity in God's word, as the Papists foolishly talk
   about, the commendation with which the prophet here honors the law
   would be altogether undeserved. Let us, then, be assured that an
   unerring light is to be found there, provided we open our eyes to
   behold it. The Apostle Peter (2 Peter 1:19) has more plainly expressed
   the same sentiment, when he commends the faithful for taking heed to
   the word of prophecy, "as unto a light that shineth in a dark place."

   106. I have sworn, and will perform Here the Psalmist speaks of his own
   constancy. He had declared a little before, that during the whole
   course of his life, he had not declined from God's law, and now he
   speaks of the purpose of his mind. By the word swear, he intimates that
   he had solemnly pledged himself to God not to alter his determination.
   The true manner of keeping God's law is to receive and embrace what he
   commands heartily, and, at the same time, uniformly, that our ardor may
   not forthwith abate, as is often the case. This also is the proper rule
   of vowing, that we may offer ourselves to God, and dedicate our life to
   him. It may, however, be asked, whether the prophet's oath may not be
   condemned as rash, inasmuch as he presumed to engage to do far more
   than man's ability is equal to; for who is able to keep the law? The
   man, then, it may be alleged, vows rashly, who promises to God a thing
   which it is beyond his power to accomplish. The answer is obvious:
   Whenever the faithful vow to Him, they do not look to what they are
   able to do of themselves, but they depend upon the grace of God, to
   whom it belongs to perform what he requires from them, in the way of
   supplying them with strength by his Holy Spirit. When the question is
   in reference to service to be rendered to God, they cannot vow anything
   without the Holy Spirit; for, as Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:5,

   "Not that are sufficient of ourselves to think anything
   as of ourselves."

   But when God stretches forth his hand to us, he bids us be of good
   courage, and promises that he will never fail us; and this is the
   source from which the boldness to swear, here spoken of, proceeds. Nor
   is it any rashness at all, when, confiding in his promises, by which he
   anticipates us, we, on our part, offer ourselves to his service. The
   question, however, still remains unsolved; for although the children of
   God ultimately prove victorious over all temptations by the grace of
   the Holy Spirit, yet there is always some infirmity about them. But it
   is to be observed, that the faithful, in making vows and promises, have
   a respect not only to that article of the covenant, by which God has
   promised that he will cause us to walk in his commandments, but also to
   that other article which is, at the same time, added concerning the
   free forgiveness of their sins, Ezekiel 11:20; 36:27; Psalm 103:13.
   David, therefore, according to the measure of grace given him, bound
   himself by oath to keep God's la encouraged by these words of the
   prophet,

   "I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him,"
   Malachi 3:17.

   107. I am greatly afflicted, O Jehovah! This verse teaches, that God
   did not cherish the fathers under the law in his bosom so delicately as
   not to exercise them with grievous temptations; for the Psalmist
   declares that he was not afflicted lightly, or in an ordinary degree,
   but above measure. His prayer to be quickened implies that he was at
   the point of death. He, however, at the same time, shows, that though
   he was besieged by death, he yet fainted not, because he leaned upon
   God -- a point worthy of special notice; for though, at the beginning,
   we may call upon God with much alacrity, yet when the trial increases
   in severity, our hearts quail, and, in the extremity of fear, our
   confidence is extinguished. Yet the prophet implores God for grace, not
   in order to his life being preserved in safety, but in order to his
   recovering the life he had lost, which indicates both the low condition
   to which he was reduced, and his continued confidence in God. We must
   also observe attentively the last part of the clause, according to thy
   word We will pray coldly, or rather we will not pray at all, if God's
   promise does not inspire us with courage in our sorrow and distress. In
   short, as we have said elsewhere, it is indispensably necessary that we
   should have this key at hand, in order to our having free access to the
   throne of grace.

   108. O Jehovah! I beseech thee, let the flee-will-offerings of my
   mouth. This verse may be read in one connected sentence, as well as
   divided into two members. According to the former view, the sense will
   be, Receive, e Lord, my sacrifices, to this end, that thou mayest teach
   me thy commandments. If we prefer dividing the verse into two clauses,
   then it will consist of two separate prayers; first, a prayer that God
   would accept the prophet's sacrifices; and, secondly, a prayer that he
   would instruct him in the doctrine of the law. I am rather inclined to
   follow the first opinion. The prophet affirms, as we have seen
   elsewhere, that nothing was more precious to him than to understand the
   doctrine of the law. Lord, as if he had said, do thou, according to thy
   good pleasure, accept the sacrifices which I offer thee; and as my
   chief desire is, to be instructed aright in thy law, grant that I may
   be a partaker of this blessing, which I am so anxious to obtain. We
   should mark all the places in which the knowledge of divine truth is
   preferred to all the other benefits bestowed upon mankind; and
   doubtless, since it contains in it the pledge of everlasting salvation,
   there is good reason why it should be esteemed as an inestimable
   treasure. Yet the prophet begins at a point remote from this, praying
   that God would vouchsafe to approve of and accept his services. By the
   word ndvvt, nidboth, I have no doubt he denotes the sacrifices which
   were called free-will-offerings. I indeed grant that he speaks properly
   of vows and prayers; but as the chosen people to propitiate God, were
   wont to offer sacrifices, according as every man had ability, he
   alludes to that custom which prevailed under the law; even as Hosea
   (Hosea 14:2) designates the praises of God "the calves of the lips." It
   was the design of God, by that ceremony, to testify to the fathers that
   no prayers were acceptable to him, but those which were joined with
   sacrifice, that they might always turn their minds to the Mediator. In
   the first place, he acknowledges that he was unworthy of obtaining any
   thing by his prayers, and that, if God heard him, it proceeded from his
   free and unmerited grace. In the second place, he desires that God
   would be favorable to him in the way of enabling him to profit aright
   in the doctrine of the law. The verb, rtsh ratsah, which he uses:
   signifies to favor of mere good will. Whence it follows, that there is
   nothing meritorious in our prayers, and that, whenever God hears them,
   it is in the exercise of his free goodness.

   109. My soul is continually in my hand. He declares, that no
   calamities, afflictions, or dangers, which he had experienced: had
   withdrawn him from the service of God, and the observance of his law.
   To bear his soul in his hand, is equivalent to his being in danger of
   his life, so that the soul was, as it were abandoned to the wind. Thus
   Job, (Job 13:14,) when he pines in his miseries: and is looking for
   death every moment, and dreading it, complains that his soul was in his
   hand; as if he had said, It is plucked from its own dwelling-place: and
   is under the dominion of death. [434] This form of expression is
   therefore unhappily wrested to an absurd meaning by ignorant people,
   who understand the prophet as intimating, that it was in his own power
   to govern his life as he pleased. So far from intending to convey such
   an idea, by this circumstance he commends his own piety, declaring,
   that although he was tossed among shipwrecks, and death in a hundred
   forms hovered before his eyes, so that he could not rest in security
   for a single moment, yet he had not cast from him the love and study of
   the Divine law. Here, again, it is well to notice the severe and
   arduous conflicts by which the fathers, under the law, were tried, that
   dangers and fears may not frighten us, or, by the weariness they
   produce, deprive us of courage, and thus prevent the remembrance of the
   Divine law from remaining impressed on our hearts.

   110. The wicked have laid a snare for me The meaning of this verse is
   similar to that of the preceding. The prophet shows more definitely in
   what respect he carried his life in his hand; namely, because, being
   hemmed in on all sides by the snares of the wicked, he saw scarcely any
   hope of life. We have previously observed how difficult it is to avoid
   wandering from the ways of the Lord, when our enemies, by their subtle
   arts, endeavor to effect our destruction. The depraved desire of our
   fallen nature incites us to retaliate, nor do we see any way of
   preserving our life, unless we employ the same arts by which they
   assail us; and we persuade ourselves that it is lawful for us to howl
   among wolves. Such being the ease, we ought, with the more attention,
   to meditate upon this doctrine, That, when the wicked environ and
   besiege us by their wiles, the best thing we can do is to follow
   whither God calls us, and to attempt nothing but what is agreeable to
   his will.

   111. I have thy testimonies as an inheritance for ever. He again
   confirms the sentiment, which cannot be too often repeated, That the
   law of God was more precious to him than all the pleasures, riches, and
   possessions, of the world. I have said, that it is not in vain that
   these things are so often repeated; for we see how violently the men of
   the world boil to gratify their unruly lusts, with what multiplied
   anxieties they are agitated, while they are unceasingly coveting
   innumerable objects; and, in the meantime, scarcely one in a hundred
   is, in a moderate degree, aiming to apply his mind to the study of the
   Divine law. The prophet, then, to stir us up by his own example,
   asserts, that he took such pleasure in God's, testimonies as to esteem
   nothing more precious. It is love only which leads us to set a value on
   any object; and, therefore, it is requisite, in order to our observing
   the Divine law with the reverence due to it, that we begin with this
   delight in it. It is not wonderful, if God's testimonies convey to our
   minds a joy, which, causing us to reject and despise all other things,
   holds our affections fast bound to them. What can be sweeter than to
   have heaven opened to us, that we may come freely into the presence of
   God, when, adopting us to be his children, he pardons our sins? What
   can be more desirable than to hear that he is so pacified towards us,
   as to take upon himself the care of our life? This I have thought good
   to observe briefly, that we might not think it strange to find David
   rejoicing so greatly in God's law. The similitude of inheritance is of
   frequent occurrence in the Scriptures; and we apply the designation of
   inheritance to that which we hold in the highest estimation, so that we
   are contented to be deprived of all other things, provided we retain
   the safe and full possession of that one thing. Accordingly, the
   prophet intimates, that whatever good things he had obtained he
   accounted them as adventitious, and that the truths revealed in God's
   word alone were to him as an inheritance. Without the Divine word all
   other things were in his estimation as nothing; so that he could
   willingly leave to others, riches, honors, comforts, and pleasures,
   provided he possessed this incomparable treasure. It is not meant to
   say that he; altogether despised the temporal benefits which God
   bestows, but his mind was not bound fast to them.

   112. I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes. In this verse he
   describes the right observance of the law, which consists in Our
   cheerfully and heartily preparing ourselves for doing what the law
   commands. Slavish and constrained obedience differs little from
   rebellion. The prophet, therefore, in order briefly to define what it
   is to serve God, asserts, that he applied not only his hands, eyes, or
   feet, to the keeping of the law, but that he began with the affection
   of the heart. Instead of the verb incline, the verb extend might with
   propriety be employed; but I am inclined to rest in the more generally
   received interpretation, which is, that he devoted himself with sincere
   affection of heart to the observance of the law. This inclination of
   the heart is oppose to the wandering lusts which rise up against God,
   and drag us any where rather than incline us to a virtuous life. The
   attempt of the Papists to defend from this passage their doctrine of
   free will is mere trifling. They infer from the words of the prophet,
   that it is in the power of man to bend his own heart in whatever way he
   pleases. But the answer is easy. The prophet does not here boast of
   what he had done by his own strength, for he now repeats the very same
   word which he had employed before, when he said, Incline my heart to
   these testimonies. If that prayer was not feigned, he doubtless
   acknowledged by it that it was the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit to
   incline and frame our hearts to God. But it is no new thing for that to
   be ascribed to us which God works in us: Paul's statement to this
   effect is very plain,

   "It is God who worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good
   pleasures" (Philippians 2:13.)

   When the prophet says of himself that he inclined his heart, he does
   not separate his own endeavor from the grace of the Holy Spirit, by
   whose inspiration he has previously declared that the whole was done.
   At the same time, he distinguishes the constancy of his pious affection
   from the transient favor of others. Thus, that he might not fail in the
   midst of his course, or even go backward, he affirms that he had
   resolved to continue in the same course during the whole of his life.
   The word qv, ekeb, to the end, in my opinion, is added to the word
   lvlm, leolam, for ever, by way of exposition; and to show us that he
   struggled manfully against all obstacles and difficulties, that they
   might not break his constancy; for no man perseveres in the service of
   God without arduous exertions. Some take the word as denoting a reward;
   [435] but this seems too foreign to the design of the passage.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [434] This proverbial expression occurs in several other places of
   Scripture, in all of which it undoubtedly signifies, that the life of
   the person who employs it is in danger; as in Judges 12:3, "And when I
   saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed
   over against the children of Ammon;" 1 Samuel 19:5, "He put his life in
   his hand, and slew the Philistines;" and 1 Samuel 28:21, "And the woman
   came unto Saul, and said, I have put my life in my hand." Phillips thus
   explains the figure: "We are accustomed to say, that an affair is in a
   person's hands when the management and issue of it rest entirely with
   him, and so we speak when that affair is the life or death of an
   individual. Hence, similarly, when the Hebrews spoke of a person's life
   being in his own hands, they might mean, that the preservation of his
   life was entirely with him, that he was destitute of all external
   assistance, and that consequently his life was in danger. This is
   particularly the case with military men, who, as they fight bravely, or
   otherwise, may preserve or lose their lives: so Jephthah, as appears
   from the passages above cited." The figure may, however, be taken from
   the circumstance, that what a man carries openly in his hand is in
   danger of taking, or of being snatched away by violence. "The LXX. have
   changed the person of the pronoun, en tais chersi sou; in thy hands; as
   also the Syriac. It is probable that these ancient interpreters did not
   understand the phrase, and so expressed it according to what they
   thought might be the original reading, thus affording a very obvious
   sense. Augustine says, that many MSS. in his time had the second
   person. However, no such MSS. are known now, and there is no doubt
   whatever of the correctness of the present text. The Psalmist states
   that, though his life was in danger, yet he did not forget God's law."
   -- Ibid

   [435] Thus, in the Arabic, it is, "on account of an eternal reward;"
   that is, the reward of grace promised to all the faithful. According to
   this view, the Psalmist would have a respect to the end and reward of
   faith and holy obedience. See Hebrews 11:26; 1 Peter 1:8, 9. As,
   however, the Psalmist, like all true believers, did not embrace and
   obey the law of God, only or chiefly from the hope of reward, but was
   chiefly attracted to obedience by love to God, and the intrinsic
   excellence of the law, others prefer reading "the reward is eternal."

   Psalm 119:113-120

   s 113. I have hated crooked thoughts, and loved thy law. s 114. Thou
   art my hiding-place and my shield: I have trusted in thy word. s 115.
   Depart from me, ye wicked! and I will keep the commandments of my God.
   s 116. Sustain me by thy word, and I shall live: and make me not
   ashamed of my expectation. s 117. Establish me, and I shall be safe:
   and I will consider thy statutes continually. s 118. Thou hast trodden
   under foot all those who wander from thy statutes; for their deceit is
   falsehood. s 119. Thou hast made all the wicked of the earth to cease
   as dross; therefore I have loved thy testimonies. s 120. My flesh
   trembled for fear of thee, and I was afraid of thy judgments.


   113. I have hated crooked thoughts. Those who are of opinion that the
   word sphvm seaphim, the first in the verse, and which is rendered
   crooked thoughts, is an appellate noun, translate it, those who think
   evil; [436] but it is more correct to understand it of the thoughts
   themselves, [437] and this interpretation is very generally adopted.
   The noun sph, saeph, properly signifies a branch, but it is applied
   metaphorically to the thoughts, which, growing out of the heart, as
   branches from the trunk of a tree, spread themselves in every
   direction. As there is no doubt that in this passage the term is taken
   in a bad sense, I have added the epithet, crooked, which the etymology
   of the word requires. [438] As the branches of a tree shoot out
   transversely, entangled and intertwined, so the thoughts of the human
   mind are, in like manner, confusedly mingled together, turning and
   twisting about in all directions. Some Jewish interpreters understand
   it of the laws of the heathen, which, they say, were cut off from the
   law of God, as branches from a tree; but although this is ingenious, it
   has no solidity. I therefore keep by the more simple explanation, That
   the crooked inventions of the human heart, and whatever the wicked
   devise, according to their own perverse understandings, are set in
   opposition to the law of God, which alone is right. And, assuredly,
   whoever would truly embrace the law of God, must, necessarily, as his
   first business, divest himself of all unhallowed and sinful thoughts,
   or rather go out of his own nature. Such is the meaning, unless,
   perhaps, preferring another metaphor, we understand sphvm, seaphim, to
   signify high thoughts, since the verb sph, saaph, is taken for to lift
   up. Now we know that no sacrifice is more acceptable to God than
   obedience, when we entertain low thoughts of ourselves; and thus our
   docility begins with humility. But as this exposition may seem also
   far-fetched, I pass from it. Let what I have: said suffice us, That
   since God acknowledges as the disciples of his law those only who are
   well purified from all contrary imaginations, which corrupt our
   understanding, the prophet here protests that he is an enemy to all
   crooked thoughts, which are wont to draw men hither and thither.

   114. Thou art my hiding place and my shield. The meaning is, that the
   prophet, persuaded that the only way in which he could be safe, was by
   lying hid under the wings of God, confided in his promises, and,
   therefore, feared nothing. And, assuredly, the first point is, that the
   faithful should hold it as a settled principle, that amidst the many
   dangers to which they are exposed, the preservation of their life is
   entirely owing to the protection of God; in order that they may be
   excited to flee to him, and leaning upon his word, may confidently wait
   for the deliverance which he has promised. This confidence, That God is
   our refuge and our shield, is, no doubt, derived from the word; but we
   must remember that there is here a mutual relation -- that, when we
   have learned from the word of God that we have in him a safe
   hiding-place, this truth is to be cherished and confirmed in our
   hearts, under a consciousness of our absolute need of the divine
   protection. Besides, although his power ought abundantly to suffice in
   inspiring us with the hope of salvation, yet we should always set the
   word before us, that our faith may not fail when his aid is slow in
   coming.

   115. Depart from me, ye wicked! Some explain this verse as if David
   declared that he would devote himself with more alacrity and greater
   earnestness to the keeping of the law, when the wicked should have
   desisted from assaulting him. And, unquestionably, when we feel that
   God has delivered us, we are more than stupid if this experience does
   not stir up within us an earnest desire to serve him. If godliness does
   not increase in us in proportion to the sense and experience we have of
   God's grace, we betray base ingratitude. This, then, is a true and
   useful doctrine; but the prophet meant to convey a different sentiment
   in this place. As he saw how great a hindrance the ungodly are to us,
   he banishes them to a distance from him; or rather, he testifies that
   he will beware of entangling himself in their society. Nor has he said
   this so much for his own sake as to teach us by his example, that if we
   would hold on in the way of the Lord without stumbling, we must
   endeavor, above all things, to keep at the greatest possible distance
   from worldly and wicked men, not in regard to distance of place, but in
   respect of intercourse and conversation. Provided we contract an
   intimate acquaintance with them, it is scarcely possible for us to
   avoid being speedily corrupted by the contagion of their example. The
   dangerous influence of fellowship with wicked men is but too evident
   from observation; and to this it is owing, that few continue in their
   integrity to the close of life, the world being fraught with
   corruption's. From the extreme infirmity of our nature, it is the
   easiest thing in the world to catch infection, and to contract
   pollution even from the slightest touch. The prophet, then, with good
   reason, bids the wicked depart from him, that he may advance in the
   fear of God without obstruction. Whoever entangles himself in their
   companionship will, in process of time, proceed the length of
   abandoning himself to a contempt, of God, and of leading a dissolute
   life. With this statement agrees the admonition of Paul, in 2
   Corinthians 6:14, "Be ye not unequally yoked together with
   unbelievers." It was, indeed, beyond the prophet's power to chase the
   wicked to a distance from him; but by these words he intimates, that
   from henceforth he will have no intercourse with them. He emphatically
   designates God as his God, to testify that he makes more account of him
   alone than of all mankind. Finding extreme wickedness universally
   prevailing on the earth, he separated himself from men, that he might
   join himself wholly to God. At the present day, that bad examples may
   not carry us away to evil, it greatly concerns us to put God on our
   side, and to abide constantly in him, because he is ours.

   116. Sustain me by thy word, and I shall live. Many read, According to
   thy word, so that the letter v, beth, which signifies in, is taken for
   the letter k, caph, which signifies as; and thus the sense would be,
   Sustain me according to the promise which thou hast made to me, or, as
   thou hast promised to me. And, undoubtedly, whenever God stretches out
   his hand to us to raise us up when we are fallen, or supports us with
   his hand, he fulfills his promises. The prophet, however, seems to
   pray, that constancy of faith may be given him, to enable him to
   continue steadfast in the divine word. We are said to fall from God's
   word when we fall from the faith of it; and in like manner, so long as
   we repose upon the truth and certainty of it, he is our sustainer. But,
   as the prophet well knew that there is not strength in man adequate to
   this, he asks from God ability to persevere as the singular gift of the
   Holy Spirit. It follows, then, that true stability is to be found no
   where else but in the word of God; and that no man can steadfastly lean
   upon it but he who is strengthened by the power of the Holy Spirit. We
   must therefore always beseech God, who alone is the author and finisher
   of faith, to maintain in us this grace. Farther, when the Psalmist
   places life in faith, he teaches, that all that men promise themselves
   without the word is mere falsehood. It is therefore the Lord alone who
   quickens us by his word, even as it is said in Habakkuk, (Habakkuk
   2:4,) "The just shall live by faith." Both passages have the same
   meaning. After Habakkuk has derided the foolish confidence of the
   flesh, with which men are generally inflated, and as manifested in
   their raising themselves on high that they may fall with the greater
   violence, he shows, that the faithful alone, whom the word of God
   sustains, stand upon safe and sure ground.

   If the first interpretation is adopted, the second clause, make me not
   ashamed of my expectation, will be added by way of exposition; for
   these two things -- the prayer that the prophet maybe preserved by
   God's grace according to his word, and the prayer that he may reap the
   fruit of his hope -- would amount to nearly the same thing. Yet, after
   having beseeched God to grant him constancy to persevere, he seems now
   to proceed farther, praying that God would, in very deed, show the
   thing which he had promised. Every man's own infirmity bears witness to
   the many doubts which intrude into our minds, when, after long
   endurance, the issue is not answerable to our expectation; for God, in
   that case:. seems to disappoint us.

   To the same effect is the next verse, except that no express mention is
   made of the word; and safety is put for life. The prophet means to say,
   that whenever God withdrew his word, it would be all over with his
   safety; but that, if he were established by the Divine power, there was
   nothing of which he would have reason to be afraid. The verb sh shaah,
   which we have translated I will consider, is rendered by many, I will
   delight, and this sense is not unsuitable; for although God may give a
   very desirable taste of his goodness in his bare word, yet the savor of
   it is not a little increased when to the word the effect is added,
   provided we do not perversely separate God's benefits from his
   promises. It is the true wisdom of faith to consider all his benefits
   as the result or fruit of his promises, of which, if we make no
   account, the enjoyment of all his good things will be of little
   advantage to us, or rather will often prove hurtful and deadly. Yet it
   appears to me preferable to render the verb by consider; for the more
   experience any man has of God's help, the more ought he to awaken
   himself to consider heavenly doctrine. The Psalmist adds, that he will
   continue to persevere in this meditation during the whole of his life.

   118. Thou hast trodden under foot all those who wander from thy
   statutes. By treading under foot he means, that God overthrows all the
   despisers of his law, and casts them down from that loftiness which
   they assume to themselves. The phrase is directed against the foolish,
   or rather frantic, confidence with which the wicked are inflated, when
   they recklessly deride the judgments of God; and, what is more, scruple
   not to magnify themselves against him, as if they were not subject to
   his power. The last clause is to be particularly noticed: for their
   deceit is falsehood [439] By these words the prophet teaches, that the
   wicked gain nothing by their wiles, but that they are rather entangled
   in them, or at length discover that they were mere sleight of hand.
   Those ignorantly mar the sense who interpose the copula and, as if it
   had been said, that deceit and falsehood were in them The word rmvh,
   remyah, signifies a subtle and crafty device. Interpreters, indeed,
   often translate it thought; but this term does not sufficiently express
   the propriety and force of the Hebrew word. The prophet means, that,
   however well pleased the wicked are with their own cunning, they yet do
   nothing else than deceive themselves with falsehood. And it was needful
   to add this clause; for we see how the great bulk of mankind are
   fatally intoxicated with their own vain imaginations, and how difficult
   it is to believe what is here asserted, -- that the more shrewd they
   are in their own estimation, the more do they deceive themselves.

   119. Thou hast made all the wicked of the earth to cease as dross. The
   meaning of this verse is similar to that of the preceding. By the
   similitude employed, there is described a sudden and an unexpected
   change, when their imaginative glory and happiness become dissipated in
   smoke. It is to be observed, that the vengeance of God against the
   wicked is not all at once manifested, so that they completely perish,
   or are exterminated from the earth; but as God, in rooting them out one
   after another, shows himself to be the judge of the world, and that he
   is purging the earth of them, it is not wonderful to find the prophet
   speaking of their destruction in this manner; for the Hebrew verbs
   often denote a continued act. As God, then, executes his judgments by
   little and little, and often suspends punishment until he see that the
   wicked abuse his long-suffering; it becomes us, on our part, to
   continue patiently waiting until, as a heathen writer observes, he
   compensate the delay of the punishment, by its severity when inflicted.
   It is abundantly evident, that the particle of similitude, as, is to be
   supplied before the word dross [440] Nor do I reject the opinion of
   those who assert, that the wicked are compared to dross, because, so
   long as they are mingled among the faithful as dregs, they infect and
   contaminate them; but when they are removed as scum, the purity of the
   godly shines forth with improved lustre. In the second place, the
   prophet adds, that the judgments of God were not without fruit in him,
   since they led him to love the doctrine of the law the more. Those who
   are not induced to commit themselves to the protection of God,
   whenever, by lifting up his hand, he shows that the world is governed
   by his power, must certainly be very perverse; but when, of his own
   good pleasure, he offers himself to us by his word, those who do not
   make haste to embrace so great a boon are stupid indeed. On the other
   hand, when he connives for a long time at the wickedness of men, devout
   affection, which should ravish us with the love of God's word,
   languishes.

   120. My flesh hath trembled for fear of thee. [441] At first sight the
   prophet seems to contradict himself. He had just now said, that, by
   God's severity, he was gently drawn to love his testimonies; now he
   declares, that he was seized with terror. But although these two
   effects differ widely from each other, yet, if we consider by what kind
   of discipline God forms us to reverence his law, we will perceive that
   they entirely harmonize. We require to be subdued by fear that we may
   desire and seek after the favor of God. Since fear, then, is the
   beginning of love, the prophet testifies, that he was awakened by a
   heart-felt fear of God to look well to himself. Nor is the
   mortification of the flesh so easy a matter, as that every one should
   consent to enter upon it, without the constraint of violent means; and,
   therefore, it is not wonderful if God struck his servant with terror,
   that, in this way, he might bend his mind to a holy fear of him. It is
   an evidence of no common wisdom to tremble before God when he executes
   his judgments, of which the majority of mankind take no notice. We are
   then taught by these words of the prophet, that we ought to consider
   attentively the judgments of God, that they may not only gently
   instruct us, but that they may also strike us with such terror as will
   lead us to true repentance.

   [436] In the Chaldee, it is "vain thinkers;" and thus the meaning would
   be, "I hate men that think evil, that devise wicked devices, or that

   seduce men from it."

   [437] It signifies thoughts in Job 4:14, and 20:2; and opinions in 1

   [438] The sense of the text also requires that the word for thoughts
   should here be taken in a bad sense, for the Psalmist affirms that he
   hates them, and sets God's law in opposition to them. Various epithets
   have been supplied to describe the character of these thoughts, such as
   "crooked," by Calvin, "vain," by our English version, and "high
   minded," by Luther. Ainsworth supplies wavering, observing, that the
   original term denotes the top branches of trees, which are figuratively
   applied to the thoughts or opinions of the mind, to denote that they
   are wavering and uncertain, as 1 Kings 18:21; or to persons distracted
   with their own cogitations. Poole remarks, agreeably to Calvin's
   interpretation, that the thoughts, or opinions, or devices of men
   differing from, or opposite to God's law, may be intended, since, in
   the next clause, God's law is opposed to them, and as some, both Jewish
   and Christian, expositors understand the Hebrew word.

   [439] Dimock thinks that, by this expression, the Psalmist; probably
   alludes to the Lex Talionis amongst the Jews, and that the Apostle
   might refer to this passage in 2 Thessalonians 2:11; where he says,
   "that God should send them strong delusion, that they should believe a
   lie."

   [440] "Before the noun sgym, rendered dross, the particle k, of
   similitude, is understood, so that the Psalmist says, Thou hast
   entirely removed (made to cease) all the wicked of the earth as dross,'
   which is removed from metals by fusion, or from corn by winnowing. The
   society of men is as a mass of metal in which the wicked are as rust
   and dross. The judgments of God, which are searching, will cause a
   separation of the dross from the metal, and thus He will destroy the
   one and preserve the other." -- Phillips

   [441] The verb smr, samar, rendered hath trembled, denotes being seized
   with horror, so that the hair stands on end. It occurs in Piel in Job
   4:15. This state of horror was produced on the mind of the Psalmist by
   a contemplation of the divine judgments executed on the wicked, who are
   rejected like dross; and he was thus brought to fear God.

   [395] It is, however, a mistake to suppose, that no connection of
   thought is observed throughout this lengthened composition, as has
   sometimes been asserted even by writers of note. "It has been too
   commonly assumed," says Jebb, that the 119th psalm is a collection of
   unconnected thoughts. To this opinion, even that most profound
   religious philosopher, Dr Barrow, inclines, (Sermon 48, on Psalm
   119:60;) and his eloquent words must, in this instance, be received
   with no small caution. this psalm,' he says, no less excellent in
   virtue than large in bulk, containeth manifold reflections on the
   nature, the properties, the adjuncts, and effects of God's law; many
   sprightly ejaculations about it, conceived in different forms of
   speech; some in way of petition, some of thanksgiving, some of
   resolution, some of assertion or aphorism; many useful directions many
   zealous exhortations to the observance of it; the which are not ranged
   in any strict order, but, like a variety of wholesome herbs in a fair
   field, do, with a grateful confusion, lie dispersed, as they freely did
   spring in the heart, or were suggested by the devout spirit of him who
   indicted this psalm; where no coherence of sentences being designed, we
   may consider any one of them absolutely or singly by itself.' The fine
   imagination of this eminent writer justly recognizes the beautiful
   variety, the variegations of thought, the polupoikilos sophia exhibited
   in this psalm; but too much seems to be conceded to the prevalent
   opinion of a want of connection. I willingly allow, that the sentiments
   are not limited and enthralled by any exact or Procrustean rule; that
   there are no measures of intellectual geometry adhered to, reducing
   this divine poem to a rigid didactic system: that the mind of the
   prophet is free, and flowing, and discursive. Still this very flow of
   thought implies connection and association, and forbids the frigid idea
   that the psalm is a mere canto of reflections, like Lord Bacon's
   collection of aphorisms, or the maxims of Isocrates. I do not intend to
   maintain what could not be proved, that a consecutive order can be
   traced throughout; but instances can, undoubtedly, be drawn of passages
   which maintan a beautiful sequence and connection between their several
   members." -- Jebb's Literal Translation of the Book of Psalms, with
   Dissertations, volume 2, pages 274-276.
