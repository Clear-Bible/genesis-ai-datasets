Introduction

  By Rev. B. T. Roberts

   Dead trees can be made into blocks, or boards of the same length, and
   breadth, and thickness. But plant two seeds from the same tree, in the
   same soil, exposed to the same influences, and they will grow up
   resembling and yet unlike each other. You can easily tell them apart.
   Life abhors uniformity.

   In a dead church ministers may be essentially alike. They may all go
   through with the same routine duties, in the same manner, and with the
   same results. But let spiritual life get into a church, and men are
   raised up to do ministerial work outside of the regular ministerial
   channels. The church itself may recognize but one class of ministers --
   it may insist upon their absolute equality, and require of all the same
   service; but when life divines comes thrilling through its members,
   some will break through all their regulations, and exercise the
   functions of an office which the church does not recognize. And thus in
   face of all human provisions to the contrary, the Scriptures are
   fulfilled, "And God hath set some in the church, first apostles,
   secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts
   of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues." -- I Cor.
   xii. 28. The phrase "hath set" denotes a permanent arrangement. In the
   original it is a word frequently translated "ordained." It does not
   refer to a short-lived plan that was to last for but a single
   generation. So the error is apparent, of the assumption that there were
   but twelve apostles; and that the apostleship ceased with these. In
   fact the New Testament speaks expressly of other apostles besides the
   twelve. The Church of England has an order of ministers which it calls
   "priests," for which order the gospel of Christ makes no provision. Not
   once in the New Testament are any of the ministers of the gospel called
   priests. They are called by a great variety of names, but this is not
   found among them. A priest is one that offers sacrifices; and in
   Christ, the High Priest of our profession, the priesthood as a
   ministerial order ceased. James is nowhere in the New Testament called
   a priest, nor is Peter, nor Paul, nor any other minister of the gospel.
   The term priest is applied in the New Testament to all of God's people.
   "Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy
   priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by
   Jesus Christ." -- I Peter ii. 5. "But ye are a chosen generation, a
   royal priesthood." -- v. 9. So Christians are required as priests to
   present their bodies a living sacrifice. (Romans xii. 1.) To present to
   God broken hearts and contrite spirits, -- for these are sacrifices
   which he will not despise (Psalm li. 17.) To abound in good works. "But
   to do good and to communicate forget not, for with such sacrifices God
   is well pleased." (See also Phil. iv. 18.) To offer praise to God. "By
   him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually,
   that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name." -- Hebrews
   xiii. 15. But none of these things can we do by proxy. No priest can
   step between us and God to do them for us. If not done in our own
   proper person, and from our own free will, they are not done at all.
   Others may persuade us; but any other sacrifice than that which Christ
   has made for us -- once for all, we ourselves must make. So those who
   would be real Christian s must reject all assumptions of priestly
   authority.

   Though the Church of England does not recognize the order of apostles
   as still in existence; yet from the ranks of its ministry, John Wesley
   stood forth before the world an apostle sent of God.

   The Methodist Church of today acknowledges no apostles, yet William
   Taylor has shown himself to be as truly an apostle, as was St. Paul or
   John Wesley.

   Among Independents, Dwight L. Moody has shown himself to be an
   evangelist, though the Independent churches know no ministers but
   pastors.

   So John Wesley Redfield stood forth in the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   the most wonderful evangelist of his day, though that church makes no
   provision for evangelists among its ministers.

   He went into the work, because of an overwhelming conviction from God
   that this was his calling. Like Paul, his "own hands ministered to his
   necessities"; and when he felt called of God to go to a place to hold
   meetings for the salvation of souls, he never stipulated that he should
   receive anything for his services, or even that his traveling expenses
   should be paid. But where he went without the promise of purse or scrip
   he never lacked anything. The Lord, in one way or another, provided for
   his wants.

   I first became acquainted with Dr. Redfield when I was a student at
   Middletown, Connecticut. He held a protracted meeting in the Methodist
   Episcopal Church. There was a large society, but a low state of
   religious experience. He preached in the afternoon to the church, in
   the evening to sinners. A great excitement was soon stirred up. Such
   preaching and such praying had never before been heard in that city.
   Many of the most prominent members of the church went forward for
   prayers, and obtained a new experience of entire sanctification. A
   spirit of opposition was manifested, and it seemed doubtful for a time
   how the tide would turn; but Dr. Stephen Olin, president of the
   University, who was suffering from a general nervous prostration, got
   up from his bed and went out to hear him. He gave the work his
   strongest endorsement, saying in substance, "Brethren, this is the work
   of God and you must stand by it."

   The college faculty, and the church generally, did stand by it, and a
   revival remarkable for its depth, and for the number of its converts,
   was the result. Some twenty-five young men who afterwards became
   preachers were converted, The whole city was in commotion and the
   country for miles around. The influence of that revival is still felt,
   not only in this country, but also in Europe, and Asia and Africa. No
   mortal can tell where a mighty wave of salvation once set in motion
   will end.

   The following pages, written by one who was converted under Dr.
   Redfield's labors, will give the reader a correct idea of the wonderful
   work which God carried on through the instrumentality of his devoted
   servant.

   We have heard many able, distinguished preachers, but we never heard
   another who would stir the human conscience to its depths like Dr.
   Redfield. His statements were clear, his descriptions vivid and
   eloquent; but his appeals to the conscience were overwhelming. He made
   those who would not obey God feel that they were utterly without
   excuse. Those who were justified or sanctified wholly under his labors
   were not easily drawn away unto the gospel of expediency. They were
   governed by principle rather than by policy. Time-serving preachers did
   not like his converts. They had no relish for religious theatricals or
   church festivals. They were hard to manage. Hence, Dr. Redfield
   generally encountered, wherever he labored, fierce opposition from
   ecclesiastics. A whole city would be moved by his preaching, while the
   presiding elder, and such as he could influence, were doing all they
   could to destroy his influence. But when once started the work went so
   deep and so strong, that no degree of violence permitted under our laws
   could kill it out. All through the land are still to be found those who
   were saved through his instrumentality, and they are generally
   characterized by the their uncompromising opposition to sin in all its
   popular forms; by their firm belief in the power of the Holy Ghost, and
   by their clear, strong, definite testimony.

   We trust that this book will be extensively read, and that it will
   carry a saving influence into thousands of families.

Author's Introduction

   In the month of January, 1858, a rumor reached the neighborhood in
   which the writer lived, four miles west of Elgin, Illinois, that a
   remarkable preacher was holding revival meetings in the Methodist
   church in town. Their curiosity being greatly excited, a wagon load of
   young people, myself among the number, started out one evening for the
   place of meeting to hear the great preacher for themselves.

   Though we arrived at an early hour, we found the house then partly
   filled, and long before the time for the service to begin, it was
   filled to its utmost capacity. Our company found seats well forward,
   and my own was where I could see every one who came in at the door. A
   few minutes before the appointed time of service, a man entered, whose
   personal appearance instantly commanded my attention. He was small of
   stature, with a massive head, pale, delicate countenance, and lustrous
   eyes. Softly and quietly he moved along the aisle toward the pulpit
   which he reverently entered. He laid aside his wraps, and as though
   shrinking from the gaze of the assembled multitude, he knelt for a few
   moments in silent prayer. His presence and manner thrilled me though he
   had not yet spoken a word. The congregation had been hushed into
   perfect silence by the same subtle influence. At this time I was
   unconverted, and I had not time, nor did I care, to analyze my
   impressions of the man; but from that moment, however, I was read y to
   listen to him with the profoundest attention.

   He arose and gave out a hymn with clear and distinct enunciation. The
   reading of the hymn was peculiarly impressive. Though a familiar one,
   each line of it took on a fullness of meaning which it never seemed to
   me to have before. He expressed its meaning, not only by the
   intonations and modulations of a remarkably sweet voice, but by his
   countenance, which seemed quiet, but forcibly, utter the same
   sentiment.

   The Prayer, which followed was more impressive still. The deep
   reverence with which he uttered the names of the divine Being, the
   clearness and simplicity of the language he used, the definite
   confidence of his manner, completely charmed me. The text for the
   occasion was Mark viii. 36: "What shall it profit a man if he shall
   gain the whole world and lose his own soul?"

   At this point the preacher's manner entirely changed. His style became
   abrupt, startling, and was characterized by great clearness and
   strength. He chose the most forceful and expressive words. His
   sentences were short and crisp. His dialect, that of the common people.
   His method, declarative and descriptive.

   His first few sentences were the following:

   "There are persons in this congregation who will sell their immortal
   souls for two-and-sixpence. Before they will lay aside a galvanized
   pewter ring they will run the risk of losing heaven. There are others
   who will sell their immortal souls for some picayunish office, and
   they'll never get as high as constable."

   There seemed to be two general divisions to his discourse the value of
   the soul as estimated (1) by what it can be purchased for; (2) by what
   it cost. About half of the time was spent in elaborating each point. On
   the first he gradually rose higher and higher in the estimate; but when
   he reached the second, his eloquence became overwhelming. One of the
   closing passages in this part of his discourse was as follows:

   "The angels of heaven were grouped together, endeavoring to estimate
   what would be the cost to redeem a human soul; but all in vain. The
   red-fingered lightning played around the rocks of Mt. Calvary,
   endeavoring to trace it in letters of fire there but all in vain. Only
   one thing could express it, and that was the dying groans of the Son of
   God."

   My most vivid recollections of the man are as he appeared in the pulpit
   that evening. In one of his most impassioned utterances, he stood with
   both hands raise above his head, his face shining as with a halo light,
   and his whole soul thrown into the eloquent thoughts that came like a
   torrent from his lips.

   The preacher to whom I listened that evening, and whose eloquent words
   and impressive appearance I still recall as vividly as though what I
   have described occurred but yesterday was the

   Rev. John Wesley Redfield,

   whose biography is recorded in the following pages.

   The impression produced upon me that evening made this man of God, to
   me, an interesting study during the few years of my personal
   acquaintance with him, and while preparing these pages for publication.

   His mental characteristics were peculiar. The intuitive faculties
   predominated. He did not reason to conclusions like most men. He saw,
   instantly, what many strong minds would require much time to reason
   out. This, doubtless, was an element of his strength and success as an
   evangelist. Difficulties had not time to develop and ripen before he
   was prepared to meet them.

   He read men. He knew what were the determining influences upon them.
   This gave character to his style of preaching. His first sermon in a
   place was with the confident positiveness of long acquaintanceship.
   This thrilled men. They knew that he knew them. When this is assumed by
   the weak, it is repulsive and disgusting, and men will not listen to
   it; but when one speaks from this intuitive knowledge, with the unction
   of the Holy One, their respect is challenged. This is because they
   recognize the message to be truth.

   Another element of his character was that of experimental conformity to
   the divine will. He utterly abandoned himself to the known will of God.
   There was no reserve in his consecration. Whether in the light or in
   the dark, favored or frowned upon by men, to his advantage or
   disadvantage, in peril or in safety, he aimed to do exactly what he
   thought God wanted him to do. One of his peculiar phrases was, "the
   exact right." He dealt with men, from the pulpit, in the altar, and in
   private, on that principle. "Calling things by their right names," was
   another of his peculiar phrases. He did not


   "Smooth down the stubborn text to ears polite,

   And snugly keep damnation out of sight."

   With him, there was no seeking for "honeyed phrase." He used but few
   large words, and those such as were in common use. He aimed to be
   understood.

   Whether naturally or acquired, he had all the elements of the orator.
   His imagination was fervid, quick, broad, and accurate; this made his
   mental pictures vivid and true to nature. He never lacked for the right
   word; this helped him to express himself clearly. His elocution was
   perfect. The framing of his sentences, the order of his thoughts, his
   gestures, the modulations of his voice, the expression of his face, and
   his manner, all, were in harmony. All these made it possible for him to
   transfer his thoughts to the minds of others with accuracy and power.
   So complete was this, that sometimes his audiences forgot themselves,
   the place and the speaker, in the vividness of the truths to which they
   were listening. This was the result of his naturalness. He felt what he
   thought, and expressed what he thought and felt.

   It will be noticed where he is quoted in the following narrative, that
   he often says, "I felt," where others would have said, "I thought."

   Another element in his character was his implicit faith in God. No
   doubts respecting God's word made their appearance in his discourses.
   With him there was no apologizing for the facts or the truths of the
   Bible. Like Abraham of old he "believed God." In his public addresses
   he seemed to take it for granted that all men believed God. Such faith
   begot faith; and the discouraged became hopeful, and the weak became
   strong in his presence. A minister, while severely criticizing his
   methods and labors, admitted that he would rather trust his own child
   under Mr. Redfield's preaching than under that of any minister he knew.

   Another element of his character was his great sympathy. Suffering in
   others he could not witness, unless he could assist in relieving it.
   When visiting among the farmers, the killing of animals, though for
   food, greatly distressed him. He would walk his room in agony until
   informed that it was over. He shrank from inflicting mental pain, and
   only from a sense of duty could he bring himself to do it.

   One of the hardest things for him to do was to bid farewell to his
   friends. He has been known to take a night train to avoid this. This
   trait made him apparently a coward. It was only when convinced that
   duty demanded it, that he could do the severe and faithful work that he
   sometimes performed. This accounts for many strange passages in his
   life which are recorded in these pages. Those who knew him only as he
   appeared in public, supposed him brave to a fault.

   Doctrinally he was in accord with the standards of Methodism. He often
   called upon his enemies in the church to show wherein he was unsound in
   the faith. Only once was this attempted, and the result was in his
   favor, and against his opposers. In his work as an evangelist, he
   recognized the office of the truth. He believed that men were, born
   again, by the word of God; that they were sanctified by the truth. He
   was careful as to his teachings, especially so with seekers for
   salvation. In altar services he often took more time to explain the way
   than he did for the season of prayer. He held his prayer services to
   definite work. The nature and fruits of repentance were kept clearly
   before the minds of those seeking pardon. The nature and the details of
   entire consecration were kept clearly before those seeking for perfect
   love. He believed in, and taught, an itemized dedication of all the
   seeker possessed, or hoped to have, to the service God. Before he
   attempted to present the way of faith, he would, in individual cases,
   carefully test the purposes, and motives, and desires of the seeker.
   All these he would bring to the standard of God's word. That standard,
   he taught, is the absolute and unconditional surrender of the soul to
   God. He taught that there is no hope of reconciliation with God without
   perfect renunciation of sin, and acceptance of Christ. He taught that
   there is no hope of attaining perfect love while there is the least
   reserve in the aims, or desires, or affections from the will of God.
   This thoroughness with the seekers often caused them great mental
   suffering. There was no attempt to shield them from feelings of despair
   while there was rebellion existing in the heart, or any doubt of
   surrendering all to God. This was what made those who were saved
   through his instrumentality so definite and clear, and, consequently,
   strong. The transition from the agony of surrendering to the peace of
   believing, was usually so marked that it thrilled all who were looking
   on. This encouraged even the impenitent to believe that if they started
   to seek Christ they would succeed. It was not unusual for seekers to
   make that transition before they reached the altar of prayer. One
   result of this was that the many were saved soon, and but few came to
   the altar more than once. In his preaching, he was careful in his
   enunciation that every word and syllable should be heard and
   understood. If there, was the least disturbance in the congregation, by
   the moving of persons, the crying of children, or the shouts of the
   saints he would wait in silence until all was quiet before proceeding.
   He aimed to present the truth which the people mostly needed. He had no
   time to spend in idle speculations or fanciful interpretations of the
   word of God. He waited before the Lord, in prayer, until he felt
   satisfied that he knew the mind of the Lord. The consciousness that he
   had made a mistake in this gave him intense pain, and caused him to
   humble himself before the Lord. When duty became clear, whether the
   truth to be preached was popular or unpopular, acceptable or
   unacceptable, he went boldly forward, trusting God with the results.
   This was not unattended with suffering for his shrinking, sensitive
   nature was often put upon the rack by it. Coarse natures who have no
   care how they make others feel can have no appreciation of his feelings
   at such times.

   But while he gave the truth its proper place, in his work, he did not
   ignore the offices of the Holy Spirit. He believed it the work of the
   Spirit to make the truth effectual. He believed the Christian minister
   might have his immediate presence and aid. He gave him free course in
   his meetings. He would not labor, nor dared he to try, where this was
   not allowed. He was more particular about that preparation for his
   pulpit efforts than he was about the sermon. The Spirit's dispensation
   was illustrated in his labors. Many and varied were the manifestations
   of this. There were often mixed with these that which was merely human,
   springing from the weakness of human nature, and which called forth the
   tenderest sympathy for the subjects of them, and the most careful
   dealing with them. There were often, also, those which seemed to be
   Satanic. He believed in a personal, intelligent, powerful devil. He
   expected every possible resistance to the truth and the Spirit of God.
   But he believed himself too weak to contend against the devil. When
   such manifestations appeared, instead of warring against them, he
   prayed for more of the Holy Spirit's presence. He believed in the
   all-conquering power of the truth and the Spirit; that where victory
   for Jesus is complete, poor human, nature will act properly, and
   Satan's power is broken.

   Because of this recognition of the Holy Spirit, the spiritual among
   God's people were greatly enlightened, strengthened, and often
   wonderfully moved under his preaching. Such people understood him when
   others did not, and were among his best and firmest friends. His
   enemies were among the worldly and time-serving. He was accused of
   dividing the church in his later years, but it was because he left no
   middle ground. The spiritual became more so, and they who would not
   yield wholly to the Lord went to the other extreme. No matter what the
   opposition or prejudice in the way, where the church authorities gave
   him freedom; almost invariably, he was victorious; for the truth and
   the Holy Spirit conquered all.

   He was developed by the circumstances and experiences of his life. The
   rebellion of his early days, the providential difficulties which grew
   out of this, and the mental struggles through which he passed, were
   used by God to prepare him for his great work. In the following
   narrative it will be interesting to trace the process by which this was
   effected.

   The most of the matter for this volume is from his own recollections,
   as penned by himself, in the last days of his life, after having been
   disabled for active labor by the palsy. He knew he was rapidly
   approaching eternity. With the most solemn feelings, he carefully
   reviewed his life and labors. It would have been pleasing to have given
   these recollections in his own words; but whether it was natural with
   him, or caused by the paralysis from which he was suffering, his style
   of writing was so unlike that of his preaching, that his friends would
   have doubted the genuineness of them, if they had been published as he
   left them. Again, for some reason, he omitted dates, and all but the
   initials of proper names. It has, for this reason, been very difficult
   to verify some of the most interesting details of his labors. I have
   been greatly assisted in this by his friends, who have contributed much
   that is valuable, which had been overlooked by Mr. Redfield, and who
   have also loaned me the use of many letters written by himself during
   the later years of his active ministry. This has made it necessary to
   change the style from the autobiographical to the biographical. I am
   much indebted to the assistance of these friends, and especially to
   Mrs. M. F. La Due, for valuable recollections of her own, and to Rev.
   W. T. Hogg for his assistance in the finishing touches to the work.

   The beautiful steel engraving which faces the title-page is contributed
   by Rev. B. T. Roberts, editor of the Earnest Christian, and senior
   general superintendent of the Free Methodist Church. The engraving
   represents Mr. Redfield as he appeared in the days of his strength.

   In hope that the following narrative may perpetuate the influence of
   this remarkable man of God and that through it, though dead, he may
   still speak, I send it forth upon its mission, commending it to the
   kind recognition and, devout, perusal of the Christian public.

                           The Life Of J. W. Redfield

CHAPTER 1

   John Wesley Redfield was born in Clarendon, New Hampshire, January 23,
   1810. On the night of his birth an esteemed Christian woman dreamed
   that she was visited by an angel who told her to go to the home of the
   Redfields and she would find there a new born son; and that she must
   announce to the mother that he must be named John Wesley. She was also
   informed that this would be assented to immediately by the mother, who
   would respond, "That is his name." This woman did as she was bidden,
   and all came to pass as she had dreamed. In mentioning this in his
   journal, Mr. Redfield says, "By that unlucky name was I baptized and
   have been known through life."

   So strongly was he impressed with his call to the ministry that when
   only eight years of age, and just able to write legibly, he attempted
   in secret to compose a sermon. When it was completed he borrowed a
   volume of Wesley's sermons that he might compare his production with
   them. When he saw the great difference between them, in perplexity and
   sadness he exclaimed: "Oh, I can never preach! I don't know anything
   about religion. I am sure I never can preach."

   So persistently did the impression of his call to preach follow him in
   his childhood that, in mature years, when attempting to run away from
   it, he was inclined to consider it an "antenatal mark."

   When about twelve or thirteen years of age he was informed of his
   mother's impressions concerning him, and the dream already related. So
   great, however, was his aversion to the work of the ministry that he
   studiously contended against his conviction by concealing his feelings
   and avoiding all conversation concerning the matter.

   When between thirteen and fourteen years of age he had such alarming
   views of his sinful state that he feared he was past all hope of mercy.
   This fear became so intense at one period that he was tempted to
   provoke God to destroy him, that, without the guilt of self-murder, he
   might learn the certainty of his fate, and, by the shortening of his
   sinful course, render his doom less aggravated. He had been seeking the
   favor of God in a secret way for some time, but in vain. He now gave up
   hope, not knowing any other way than that which he had followed. His
   distress of mind continued without abatement until he overheard some
   Christian friends speak of a contemplated camp meeting, which they
   trusted would result in the conversion of sinners. At this, hope
   revived, and to himself he said, "If I go, I too may be converted."

   He obtained permission from his parents to go, and when the time
   arrived he was on the campground. His attention was directed to the
   altar before the stand, with the remark, "There many were converted
   last year." Almost instantly his heart rebelled against the thought of
   going to such a place. Even in his last days he would express his
   astonishment at that manifestation of rebellion against God.

   In due time a goodly number of tents had been erected, and an old
   gentleman invited him to a prayer meeting about to commence in one of
   them. He went and was asked to kneel with the company. He did so, but
   soon felt greatly mortified at the thought of its being in sight of
   every passerby. The praying seemed childish, if not ludicrous. He made
   up his mind that it would be impossible to find salvation there.

   In process of time the erection of tents was completed, and the
   congregation gathered before the stand for the first preaching service.
   The sainted Wilber Fisk was in charge of the meeting. The preachers
   were called into the stand, and the service commenced. At the close of
   the sermon seekers were invited into the altar; and the troubled boy
   was among them. The same good old man who invited him into the prayer
   meeting was now to instruct him in the way of salvation There was quite
   a number of seekers and all were praying lustily. This completely
   absorbed his attention. As many others have done, he began to
   criticize, instead of praying. In relating this experience he says, "I
   thought, this cannot be the way to seek religion! Why can't they be
   more calm and rational about it? Certainly they will never be able to
   think their way through amid so much noise and confusion! At least I
   can do nothing without a quiet time to think." Speaking of this in his
   last days, he said, "How little did I understand that all reasoning or
   human planning was useless here!"

   But he soon saw that this apparently irrational way and this vociferous
   manner were successful; for some of the seekers were getting saved. As
   every other way with him had failed, he at last thought he would try
   this one. So he cried aloud, "Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner." but
   he was shocked and mortified at the sound of his own voice He did not
   find salvation in loud prayers, nor was he finally converted while
   praying. This effort to pray proved a good thing to him, however, in
   one respect; he was now fully and publicly committed to seek the Lord,
   his pride was humbled and he was fast getting down where Jesus could
   help him. He gave up all his experimenting and reasoning, and
   determined to take the narrow way at every cost.

   He soon left the altar and went out into the woods alone. Under a large
   tree he knelt and vowed to take Jesus for my only Saviour. Speaking of
   this experience, he says. "Instantly, as I ventured on Jesus, my burden
   was gone. I was filled with inexpressible delight, and before I was
   aware of what I was doing, was on my feet and shouting, "Glory God"!
   Shocked at this strange and almost spontaneous utterance. I said to
   myself "What does this mean? I had heard the Methodists say, "Glory to
   God," but I don't know what it means!" My burden was all gone.
   Everything around seemed vocal with the praises of God, and as the
   Indian said in similar circumstances. "The trees looked glad, and the
   birds sang glad, the world looked glad, and I felt glad." All nature
   seemed in harmony, like a beautiful and well-tuned harp, and sang
   praises to the Most High. My heart could now beat time to the heavenly
   music I heard around, above, beneath, and within. But I had not the no
   distant idea that this was conversion. I thought some strange thing had
   happened to me. I had been sure that I would know when I was a
   Christian by a peculiar gloom that would settle down upon me. I had
   thought that a peculiar desolation of the heart and of the appearance
   of all things would attest that had obtained that for which I sought. I
   was desirous of attaining such an uncomfortable state, that I might be
   saved from the doubts and despair that hung over me. Bewildered at what
   had now taken place, and wishing to know what to do, I returned to the
   campground and asked an elderly lady who professed to be a Christian,
   "What do you think is the matter with me? My burden is all gone, and I
   can't feel bad if I try; and I love God and everybody. I don't know but
   I'll have to be damned after all; but I can't feel one fear."

   "Why," said she, "you are converted, and this is religion."

   "But I thought that religion would make me feel gloomy!"

   "Oh no!" said she, "it makes people feel happy."

   "Well," said I to myself, "if this is religion, the world will now soon
   be converted for I shall tell it so plain that everybody will certainly
   believe and seek, and find it."

   "So exalted did salvation seem, and so valuable, and so ardently did I
   desire the salvation of those around me, that I felt I could have laid
   down my life to impart salvation to the world. I now found elements in
   my soul, which by their aspirings, and exalted perceptions, and
   appreciative powers, "showed me to be in family alliance with the great
   Father. I would often say, "I am a child, an heir of God!" How
   astounding was the thought! How overwhelming! When I passed along the
   streets, after my return home, every sound and sight seemed, written
   all, over and vocal with, "Glory to God in the highest, forever."

   He immediately went to work for others. Full of the hope of success, he
   approached a young man of his acquaintance and spoke to him on the
   subject of salvation. He says, "I expected to see his eye flash with
   hope, and to hear him exclaim, "Where! where! where may I find it?" and
   to find him ready to do anything to obtain it. But he turned upon me
   with a look of unutterable scorn, which seemed to say, "What! have you
   become a Methodist fool? Away with such stuff! I don't want to hear a
   word about the silly subject." I was taken all aback. I had expected
   the same kind of a reception that I would have had if I had brought to
   him the news of a gold mine, or that he had been selected for one of
   the highest officers of the state."

   After the camp meeting young Redfield started for his home. He visited
   some relatives on the way, told them what the Lord had done for him,
   and urged them to seek the same salvation. But he seemed to them like
   one that mocked. He obtained permission to pray with one large family,
   and a short time after was made happy by the news that all had been
   converted. On the way home he told a young man who had also been
   converted at the same meeting, that for a long time he had desired,
   that he would make a start, that it might be easier for himself to do
   the same, and was surprised to find that this young man had experienced
   the same feeling with respect to him.

   When he reached home he set up the family altar in his father's house.
   This, by some, was thought to be going too far; but the importance of
   the matter, and the danger in which he saw sinners, swallowed up all
   false propriety. In little while he had the privilege of seeing a large
   number of acquaintances starting out to go with him.

   He now began to go from house to house and from town to town, to carry
   the glad news of a Saviour. When engaged in this work he learned what
   he had not thought of before that the human heart hates God and
   dislikes those who love God; but he resolved to be the friend of God if
   it made every one his enemy. Referring to those labors, he says,

   I came to a house in my journey, and went in and asked of each inmate
   their religious state. The woman ordered me to leave. As I left, I
   said, I am clear from all further obligation, and now I shake off the
   dust of my feet against you. I will meet you once more, in the judgment
   of the great day.' I left, as I felt forbidden of God to stay. But the
   woman came to the door, and, until I was out of hearing, called for me
   to come back. But I followed my own impression and went on."

   In the house of a Universalist he pressed the matter of personal and
   immediate salvation until the man's patience gave out and he threatened
   him with violence. Being only about fifteen years of age, his youthful
   appearance made him friends who protected him. He here learned a lesson
   the people were forsaking their sins and seeking the Lord, and the
   Universalists were made angry by it, notwithstanding their boasted
   religion of love.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 2

   Dr. Wilber Fisk, who was a familiar guest at the home of the Redfields
   now began to take a great interest in this young worker, and suggested
   to his parents that he be sent to the Wilbraham Academy. The young man
   saw that the old subject of preaching was at the bottom of this; and
   that the course he was even then pursuing would lead him into that work
   sooner or later. Then all his old abhorrence and dread of that calling
   revived, and he resolved to quit the field at once. He says, "I had
   such views of the awful responsibility of a Christian minister that I
   dared not undertake it without the most positive evidence of my call.
   If I could have had that I would not have stopped to confer with flesh
   and blood. I felt, as it seems to me, like a man ignorant of navigation
   would feel if sent to take charge of a vessel freighted with human
   life, and liable to run into danger, not knowing when or where. This
   sense of responsibility was to me overwhelming."

   This feeling never left him. Even in the days of his greatest success
   and pulpit power, he has been known to be unable to eat his breakfast
   when he was to preach in the morning; and he usually did not partake of
   supper until after preaching at night. The reader will see more and
   more how this feeling evoked his rebellion against God, and was the
   occasion of the most terrific mental sufferings. If his friends could
   have foreseen the fearful results of their anxiety and haste in
   reference to this matter, probably they would have taken a different
   course. How often is the same mistake made with the young and
   inexperienced!

   In the state of mind which has just been described, he returned home;
   but his peace and power with God were greatly diminished. He began to
   try to settle the question by mere reasoning. His youth, his limited
   knowledge his want of means for acquiring knowledge, and his sense of
   the weakness of all human effort, took on an importance in his
   consideration of the matter which, for the time, overshadowed the
   promises of help held out in the Bible. His Christian friends still
   unwisely beset him with their impressions of what his duty was. He
   says, "My own earlier impressions and those of my mother and the talks
   I had from time to time with Dr. Fisk, made me perfectly miserable. I
   think it was these influences, at this time, more than the voice of
   God, that caused it. My whole nature shrunk from occupying a position
   so sacred as that of the Christian ministry. Without the sanction of
   God, to me it was sacrilege. I now reasoned that my first impressions
   in this matter were the result of the influence of others upon me, and
   resolved to go among strangers, that I might be beyond the reach of
   this influence; and, further, so to commit myself by contract to the
   service of another, and he a stranger, as to make it impossible for me
   to engage in religious work. It seemed to me that I might, at least for
   a time, in this way secure a settled state of mind."

   The gentleman whom he sought was an artist by profession, and noted for
   his proficiency. Without giving his reasons, young Redfield obtained
   the consent of his father to go, but hid the matter from his mother.

   He started on his journey, and when beyond the limits of his
   acquaintance was thankful to feel secure from the besetments of other
   people's impressions. He called at the home of a minister to leave a
   letter that had been committed to his care. The minister was away, but
   his wife was at home. As he handed her the letter she looked him in the
   face and said "Tell me, are you not running away from God?"

   To this he replied: "I think, madam, that some one has been writing to
   you concerning me."

   "O," she replied, "I never saw or heard of you before; but as soon a I
   saw you I was impress that you were run away from your duty." She then
   asked: "Will you please bring me a pail of water from the spring?" He
   could not well refuse to do this, but when it was done she asked him to
   cut her some wood. Before he was through with this this an old man came
   into the yard, attended by a girl. He had seen in the house when he
   first came. He was now invited into the house and introduced to the old
   man, who, he found, was a minister of the gospel. Now he saw that the
   woman had detained him purposely until this man could be brought. The
   minister was introduced as Father Liscomb. The old man informed young
   Redfield that he was holding a revival meeting in a little hamlet a
   short distance away, and desired him to go and see the young converts.
   To avoid any talk on the subject of duty he instantly said, "I will
   go," but he secretly determined to leave the old gentleman at the first
   convenient opportunity.

   They soon started away together, and as they walked along he inquired
   the way, and the distance to W_____, his place of destination. This was
   given him, and they walked on until they came to a house. The old man
   knocked at the door, and was bidden to come in. As he passed in, young
   Redfield turned and ran towards some woods that lay between him and the
   place he desired to reach. It was a beautiful afternoon in September,
   the sun was about two hours high, and it was only five miles to W_____,
   by the woods road. About eighty rods brought him to the woods, and he
   entered them with congratulations at his nice escape. He lost his way
   and wandered about until night came on. His experience on this occasion
   is best related in his own words.

   He says: "I could not tell East from West, nor North from South. Soon I
   was wading in mud and water, stumbling over logs and running against
   trees, scaring up squirrels and wild creatures until I seemed to be
   surrounded with animals and reptiles which I could hear but not see. I
   at last felt I was contending with a power that was stronger than
   myself. My fears were so greatly aroused that I promised God if he
   would lead me out of the dreadful place I would take any course he
   might direct. In a moment I felt a gentle pull no stronger than a hair
   leading me, but I could not tell the direction. Soon I perceived I was
   out of the woods. I followed that leading until I found myself against
   a fence. I got over, crossing several fields and climbed as many
   fences, until I perceived by the feeling of my feet that I was in a
   road. While stopping to ascertain my whereabouts, I saw a light in a
   window a short distance away, and it proved to be at the very house
   where I met the old minister. The thought came a moment, if I return to
   the house the lady will only distress me by pressing upon me her
   convictions of what my duty is, and that I cannot bear. The next
   thought was, this is the direct road to W_____, and it is only seven
   miles there. There is now no fear of my getting lost, for the fences
   will guide me, and possibly by morning I may reach the place. By going
   tonight I shall avoid any further annoyance from the preacher's wife.
   As I turned to go I saw the woman in the road as plainly as I had seen
   her the day before in the house. I asked, "Mrs. B_____, what time of
   night is it?" But she gave me no answer. Again, I asked, "Did you feel
   alarmed at my absence? and have you come out to look for me?' Still she
   did not answer me. I then told her I had been lost, and was just out of
   my dilemma. I also told her that I desired she would say no more to me
   of duty, for I was too agitated to hear it. Yet she did not speak, and
   I thought, she is trying to frighten me into obedience to her opinion
   of what is my duty. I then said to her, "You will not frighten me for I
   am resolved never to preach until I am positive that God says, Go. I am
   going this night to W_____; so goodnight." As I started she stepped in
   front of me. I turned to pass by her, and she stepped in front of me
   again. Again endeavored to pass by her, but again she stepped in front
   of me. I then said, "Madam, I thought you were a professor. "What will
   your neighbors think when they find your conducting yourself in this
   manner?"! Still I got no response from her. "You need not think to
   crowd me off the course you think I ought to go, by tricks of this
   kind," I continued. Still she was silent. I was then seized with such
   fear that I turned and ran to the house; and as I entered, she sat
   there as if waiting for me. She immediately said, "I expected you would
   come back; for I prayed God to put my image before you as the angel
   appeared before Balaam." "Well I thought it was you," I said, and with
   this one sentence I exposed all the facts.

   "On looking I found it was twelve o'clock. I asked her for a place of
   rest for the remainder of the night. She gave me a light and told me
   where to find a room. I now resolved to get up and be off for W_____
   before she could have a chance to annoy me in the morning.
   Notwithstanding the remarkable character of this experience, it seemed
   to me I was enduring great hardship.

   "I arose early as I had determined, but when I stepped into the
   sitting-room, which it was necessary for me to pass through, there she
   sat in a chair. I spoke first, and said, "Don't say a word to me about
   duty, for I am resolved that no human influence shall determine my
   course. I shall go to W_____ today. I dare not allow myself to be
   prevailed upon to take so fearful a position as that of a gospel
   minister. So good morning."

   "On attempting to open the outside door, I felt the force of a hand on
   the latch outside. I stepped back, and when the door opened, there
   stood a man, who, putting his hand upon my head, said to me, "Stop,
   Jonah! for you are running away from God."

   "Said I, "You are in the secret, too! are you?"

   "I never saw or heard of you before this moment," he replied. "I live
   four miles from here I am not a believer in dreams, but I had one last
   night, in which I was told to come to this house and here I would find
   a young man who was trying to run away from God. And I was told to tell
   you to go and preach the gospel or you would be damned.

   "I have come four miles to stop you." "But I broke away and went on my
   journey.

   "I found the artist. He was willing to enter into a contract with me,
   but while I was talking with him, I was again seized with such fear,
   and with such a sense of guilt, that I dared not say a word more. I
   went out and left the place, nor dared look back until sure that I was
   out of sight of the town."

CHAPTER 3

   Returning home, young Redfield now resolved to live religion, but to
   abandon all thought of preaching, unless God by unmistakable signs
   should reveal it to him as his will. He passed the winter and the
   following summer in a restless and uncomfortable state of mind. He was
   continually mourning over his sad condition, and wondering why he
   should be the victim of such impressions, and yet have no certain
   evidence to settle the matter. He would allow none to speak to him in
   regard to it, and would seek counsel from none.

   Late in the fall he saw, in the western sky, an indescribable sign. The
   impression made upon him by it was, "That hangs over where God would
   have you go to labor." But this distressed him still more. The thought
   of following such a sign was contrary to all his ideas of propriety in
   matters of such great concern. He reasoned that in a matter of such
   importance, where there is possibility of making a mistake, and that
   mistake liable to be a fatal one, he had a right to expect of God a
   reasonable and unmistakable evidence of his will. But in spite of all,
   "Woe is me if I preach not the gospel," continually rang through his
   heart. Still, also, that sign hung in the sky, with the same impression
   of its import. At last he determined to ask for another to corroborate
   the first, but none came. His appetite and sleep forsook him, until in
   two months he was very much wasted. He became afraid that he might
   become insane. He had asked that an angel or a bird might come to him
   as an assurance that the sign he continually saw in that place in the
   sky was from God, or that an audible voice might speak to him, then he
   would obey it. Still the answer did not come. He at last resolved to
   seek for it by fasting and prayer. He set the day for the struggle,
   also determining to follow it by a watch-night. He expected that by
   twelve o'clock at night, a bird or angel, or voice would settle his
   doubts. The hour came, the town clock struck; he counted the strokes;
   it was twelve; but no bird, nor angel, nor voice came. He said to
   himself, "I am glad that I have gone through with my fast and
   watchnight. Now I can go to rest, and drop this terrible subject. The
   absence of the testimony I have asked for is sufficient to satisfy me
   that my impressions as to preaching, and that sign, are unreliable. I
   have been the dupe of hallucination."

   An impression now came to him to open the Bible and see what light he
   could get from that. He says: "I opened it at random and let my finger
   touch without knowing where. On looking I found it on the words in
   Genesis 17:3: "Therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which
   I command thee." For a moment I was disturbed; but soon I reasoned:
   that was purely a happen so; I will try once more; I'll reach far
   enough in opening not to touch the same spot again. I next put my
   finger on Deuteronomy 8:15: "But it shall come to pass if thou wilt not
   hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all his
   commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day, that all
   these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee." I reasoned this
   away and tried again. This time my finger fell upon Jonah 3:2: "Arise,
   go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that
   I bid thee." This shook me greatly and well nigh upset all my hopes of
   finding relief but I reasoned: we are not under the Old Testament
   dispensation. I will venture to open in the New Testament. My finger
   now touched the quotation by the Saviour, "The Spirit of the Lord is
   upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel," etc. Filled
   with fear, I begged the Lord not to be angry with me, but to let me try
   once more, and I would not ask again. I opened and touched the words,
   "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature."

   Thus five times in succession did I touch upon the words that
   corroborated my impressions, and the impressions of others, but which
   were opposed to my opinions and desires. My soul was now upon the rack
   worse than ever. I could not rest, I could not sleep. It was in
   midwinter and very cold; but I went forth into the fields and woods to
   try a new place, in hope that God would send me a bird or angel or
   voice. I knelt in the snow and pleaded with God as a man would plead
   for his life to grant me such an answer as I desired but no answer of
   that kind came. I went from place to place until I reached the top of a
   hill in a grove. Here I knelt once more. While pleading there I had
   such a sense of the awful majesty and near approach of an offended God
   that my agony of body and soul became extreme and I thought I could not
   live. Instantly I cried out, O God, remove this from me and I'll go.'
   Immediately I was relieved; but soon my doubting heart said, I've seen
   no bird, nor angel, nor heard a voice; how can I go?' I went to a
   hilltop farther on, overlooking a swamp, knelt down, and continued in
   prayer for some time. When I tried to rise I found my clothing was
   frozen to the earth. So great had been my agitation that I had not
   thought of the cold. I pulled my knees loose, but found I could not
   rise until I had rubbed my limbs warm. At last, with great difficulty,
   I arose and started towards the house. I passed the spot where I felt
   the presence of God so painfully, and went down into a valley, and sat
   down on a log. Though still in great distress of mind, the impression
   came: "Stand still and see the salvation of God." The next moment a
   bird came and alighted on my shoulder. I shook it off, but it came
   again. I then thought: I may be in its way. I arose, went to the top of
   another hill, and knelt in prayer again, under a pine tree. While thus
   engaged, a sound passed through the tree like that of a stiff breeze,
   but no wind seemed stirring. I listened and looked, but saw nothing. I
   arose and went home. It was morning, and my father, after building a
   fire, had gone to the barn. When I entered the room and came in contact
   with the warm air I became so faint that I dropped into a chair by the
   door, pale, haggard, and weak. My mother came into the room that
   moment, and seeing my distressed look, was frightened, and exclaimed,
   "Why, John what's the matter?" I made out to answer, "Nothing, mother";
   but perceiving my feelings about to betray me, I arose and went out
   into the cold again. When beyond hearing I gave vent to my anguish in
   loud sobbing and weeping.

   "I now determined to spend this day also in fasting and prayer, and
   conclude it with a watch-night. When twelve o'clock at night came
   again, it was with the same results. I then thought: I will turn to the
   word of God again. I opened to the words, "There shall no sign be
   given." As this spoiled all prospect of sleep, I went out into the
   fields again. I said to myself: There is that sign still in the sky.
   Reason says: I must be under a religious hallucination; but, true or
   false, I cannot settle the matter of duty or shake it off. My body is
   worn down; my mind is almost distracted. I must either go deranged or
   die. There is but one thing I can do, that is, to go to the place and
   test the matter. I had no sooner resolved to go than, cold as it was, I
   was all in a glow of warmth, and as happy as I could bear.

   "I could not tell any one my feelings. I returned to the house. It was
   now daylight. I entered the parlor and went to a bureau in which my
   linen was kept, and commenced to pack a small bundle to take with me.
   While thus engaged, my sister Mary, then living at home, came into the
   room and with streaming eyes handed me a Bible and hymn-book, and said:
   "Brother John, the victory is gained." I could contain no longer; I
   broke forth in convulsed sobbing and weeping, but said not a word. She
   afterwards told me that she knew at this time, all about my struggle,
   and was engaged in secret prayer for me all the time; and also that she
   knew the very moment when it was over, though she was in the house and
   I quite a distance away. I had supposed all the time that none but God
   and I knew anything about it."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 4

   Taking only a small bundle with him, and without saying farewell, he
   started out to seek the place designated by the sign. He intended to
   take a straight line to the place, regardless of roads. His joy was now
   unspeakable. When he opened the door to start, a young man stood before
   it, who asked, "Where are you going?" He could only say, "I am going
   west." Said the stranger, "Wait a minute and you can ride with me. The
   invitation was accepted, but with the determination to ride with him
   only as long as his course was toward that sign. All day they rode in a
   westerly direction. Just at sundown, as they reached the bottom of a
   hill, the driver turned to a road leading south, and the sign
   disappeared. Young Redfield said not a word, but thought, "The mystery
   is solved. I have been following a phantom." He asked the young man to
   stop and let him get out, as he desired to take the road to the right.
   That led to the west. The stranger answered: "You had better go to the
   top of the hill, and stop there at the house of an old minister until
   morning, as it will be a long way before you will find a stopping place
   on that road." He accepted the suggestion and went on. When they
   reached the house the young man knocked at the door and they were
   bidden to come in. The minister and his family were standing around the
   table and had been about to say grace over their evening repast, after
   the manner of that day. As the old man looked upon young Redfield the
   tears filled his eyes, and it was some moments before he could control
   his emotions. At last he said, "This young man must stop with me. God
   showed me in a dream sometime ago that you were coming to help me on my
   circuit. I never saw you before except in my dream, and when you came I
   instantly recognized you." On taking a seat Mr. Redfield opened his
   hymn-book to the verse,


   "Master, I own thy lawful claim,

   Thine, wholly thine, I long to be;

   Thou seest at last I willing am,

   Where'er thou goest to follow thee.

   Myself in all things to deny,

   Thine, wholly thine to live and die."

   He says, "I now felt myself fully committed to do God's will, although
   I kept and pondered these things in my heart. The heavenly sweetness
   and calmness which took possession of my soul, I have no words to
   describe."

   The old preacher took him on to a part of his circuit where
   Universalism was a great obstacle in the way of the work. He commenced
   his work here in the same way in which he had previously labored, by
   visiting from house to house. He met with opposition and threats of
   personal violence, but the more he labored the more he felt the value
   of souls, and the importance of his mission. When threatened, he would
   reply, "My message is from God to you, and I shall not, I dare not,
   disobey him. It is at your peril if you do not heed it," and with tears
   running down his face he would insist upon a definite answer to his
   appeals. Sometimes amid threats he would kneel and pray, presenting the
   case of each person present to God. On rising he would take them by the
   hand, when they would allow it, and tell them, "I am here in the name
   of the great God. I have done my duty faithfully. Farewell, I will meet
   you again in the judgment."

   He would leave them in various moods. Sometimes penitent and sometime
   in a rage. "Yet," he says, "I do not remember a single instance where
   they did not send for me within twenty-four hours, to come and pray for
   them."

   One afternoon, two Methodist ministers called and asked him to visit a
   Mr. B_____, a Universalist, by whose influence the revival was much
   hindered. They had both been to see him, but could not convince him of
   his error. One of them said, "I have used the arguments of Fisk and
   Fletcher, and yet nothing shakes his confidence in Universalism." Young
   Redfield said, "I will ask the Lord about it."

   "That night he was instructed in a dream to visit the Universalist, and
   also as to how to approach him, and by what method he should endeavor
   to draw his attention to the great importance of attending immediately
   to the matter of his personal salvation. The next morning early, he
   proceeded to the man's house, and, on entering, said to him: "I have a
   message from the great God to you, and that is, you must repent and
   seek salvation or you will be damned."

   Said he, "I don't believe in your damnation doctrine."

   Without attempting to reply the young man asked, "Will you obey God and
   shun damnation?"

   Again Mr. B_____ tried to avoid answering, but young Redfield said, "My
   message is from God; will you obey it?"

   At this the man became very angry and ordered him out of his house,
   threatening him with a beating if he did not go.

   Mr. Redfield replied: "You strike me at the peril of God's displeasure;
   for the God who has sent me on this errand of mercy will certainly
   stand by me and defend me. So touch me if you dare. I am on God's
   business."

   The Universalist's wife now exclaimed, "Oh! will you pray for me?" with
   tears. He instantly knelt, and both the man and his wife knelt with
   him. God so far broke his opposition that his influence for evil from
   this time was checked.

   The work of God soon broke out with power, and swept over all that
   section.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 5

   After a short time, the sign appeared again, directing him to another
   field. Yet he secretly resolved to go home. Carelessly he signified
   this intention to one who immediately said: "I should think you would
   be afraid the judgments of God would follow you." The following
   morning, as he was making preparations to go home, he was suddenly
   seized with great pain, and to find relief, he consented to obey God.
   As soon as the pain was gone, however, he made another attempt to
   return home. He finished dressing, and reached the top of the stairs,
   when the same agony of body again came on, and with it the impression,
   "If you do not consent, you will die and be lost." He says: "I then
   told the Lord if he would relieve me, I would go, and instantly I was
   free from pain, and as happy as I could be."

   "After breakfast," he continues, "I started. It was very cold, and the
   snow was deep, but I went on, singing, "December's as pleasant as May."
   I visited every house as I went, warning the people to flee from the
   wrath to come. My name and manner of work had gone before me, and some
   were so much afraid of me that they left their houses at my approach.

   "When I reached the place of my destination, I was led to go to the
   class leaders first. The day had been too severe for the children to
   attend school, and they were all at home. I asked the father and
   mother: "Are you on the way to heaven?' The father replied: "We trust
   we are." Said I: "God has sent me to tell you that you are on the road
   to hell. and you will certainly be lost unless you repent and seek the
   pardon of your sins." I had no sooner spoken than the tears began to
   stream down my face; but my words aroused a turbulent spirit within
   him, and with vehemence he ordered me out of the house. I told him I
   could not go until I had obeyed my instructions from God. "Then," said
   he, "I'll use means to get you out," and he seemed about to raise a
   chair to strike me. I said to him: "You will strike me at your peril
   while I am delivering God's message to you." I then turned to the
   children and asked them: "Do you wish to go to hell with your father
   and mother?' With tears, they said: "No, sir." I asked: "Will you kneel
   down while I pray for you? You need not fear that your father will hurt
   me, for God will defend me." Down they knelt, and that brought their
   parents to their knees, and they began in good earnest to seek God.
   When I arose, the man and his wife began to confess their backslidings,
   and invited me to stay for the night. This I did, but feeling in the
   morning that my work was done in that place, I returned. The class
   leader went to work for God, and was the means of reviving the work of
   the Lord in that neighborhood."

   Soon after his return, he met the preacher in charge, who informed him
   that it was the desire of the presiding elder that he unite with the
   church, be licensed to preach and take regular work on a circuit. To
   this he finally consented, and went to the next quarterly meeting. The
   elder preached as usual at the Saturday service, and held the quarterly
   conference immediately after. While the congregation was passing out,
   and the members of the conference were waiting for it to become quiet,
   the elder related a ridiculous story that produced boisterous laughter,
   in which he joined; and when it was at its height, he said, "Let us
   pray," and immediately led in prayer. The effect of this upon young
   Redfield can best be given in his own words:

   "This was too much for my sensitive conscience, and the devil took the
   advantage of it by setting me to reasoning thus: "Does this man believe
   the Bible? Did Jesus set such an example of trifling in the presence of
   a perishing world? Is it true that sinners are now passing away, every
   hour, to the judgment? Is this like Paul, who for the space of three
   years, night and day, with tears, labored for the salvation of sinners?
   Am I in a hallucination? Am I wild, or blind? Be it as it may be, all I
   can see from my standpoint is the Saviour of the world, staggering
   under a world's sin, while its masses in proud procession are on their
   way to eternal night. If the Bible is true, the world is on the eve of
   a terrible catastrophe, and about to pass into eternity unprepared. I
   can hardly stop to sleep lest men be lost while I am at rest. There
   must be a mistake somewhere, and it is quite probable I am the one that
   is mistaken. The elder is a man of years, and in all probability when
   young was as zealous and ardent as I am, but he has found that religion
   is a sham, and now continues to preach for the profit it is to him. I
   will never accept of a license until I settle the question for myself
   of the truth or falsity of the Christian religion."

   He refused the license, and after the quarterly meeting went home to
   his father's house. In after years he could look back and see that here
   was the great mistake of his life. He says: "Little did I dream that I
   had undertaken one of the most absurd tasks imaginable. I might as well
   have attempted to solve a question in algebra, by the principles of
   music, or the science of astronomy by the rules of grammar, as to
   attempt to solve the problems of religion by the light of reason.
   However, I began the attempt. But I again found myself beset with
   people who would urge upon me their impressions of my duty to go into
   the gospel field. To get rid of this annoyance, I again resolved to go
   where I was not known. My motives for going I kept a secret, lest I
   should involve others in my perplexity."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 6

   In the peculiar state of mind described in the foregoing chapter, young
   Redfield again left home, going about a hundred miles from where he was
   known. In less than a fortnight after his arrival at his new
   destination, however, he was questioned about the duty of preaching.
   This caused him to leave again. This time he chose a place where he
   felt sure he would not be annoyed by anything of that kind, but here he
   found old acquaintances who raised the question, within a week. Then he
   left again, resolved not to profess religion at the next place, nor to
   have anything to say on the subject, thinking in that way to avoid the
   annoyance. Soon after this he found himself beset with infidel notions;
   and at last his faith in Christianity utterly gave way. He could now
   get along comparatively well in the daytime, but his nights would be
   filled with dreams of preaching, and so overcome in his feelings would
   he be, that on waking he would find his pillow wet with tears. He now
   began to believe that he had been the dupe of deception through all his
   strange course. To end the matter once and for all he finally resolved
   to ask God to take away the conviction of duty, even if it was from
   him. He had heard of a man who did that, and who was instantly
   relieved, never to have the feeling come back. He now experienced the
   same relief. In after years, when looking back with horror upon this
   passage in his life, he could only account for the after return of the
   Spirit by referring it to the prayers and intercessions of his mother.
   He says:

   "I felt the Holy Spirit leave me as plainly as I ever felt the taking
   off of my coat; and yet with no greater alarm than at the loss of a
   penny. To me, now, infidelity was a fact, and right in its wake came
   downright atheism. For as soon as I resolved to settle all theological
   questions by my external senses, a vague uncertainty came over
   everything. Nature's laws were all the God I could find, and the mere
   notion that a given system of religion might be true was the utmost my
   reason could conjecture. It now seemed to me that all the phenomena of
   religious emotion, of mental and moral changes, were due to laws within
   us, and beyond our control. Now, the funeral pall of annihilation
   settled down upon me, and I could see nothing but darkness and
   desolation. Man and earth seemed orphaned. I sought in anatomy,
   physiology, and philosophy for testimony to clear this up, and, if
   possible, give me a single fact to settle my distracted mind. One
   favorite haunt of mine during this period was an ancient Indian burying
   ground. Some of the graves were entirely gone, washed away by the high
   waters of an adjoining stream; others were partly gone, the dark sands
   of which gave traces of the bodies which had been laid there to rest
   several hundred years before. A few seashells, flint arrowheads and
   hatchets, and beads were all that bore testimony that these bodies had
   ever lived. In contemplation of these things my whole soul would cry
   out, while the suffocation of death seemed to be upon me, "O God, if
   there be a God, send me to the hell of the Bible, but don't annihilate
   me." It seemed to me at such times that I could have died a hundred
   deaths if that would have made the Christian doctrines true, and have
   run my chances of heaven or hell.

   I now commenced the systematic study of anatomy, for the purpose of
   ascertaining whether man had a conscious, thinking, acting, soul,
   independent of the body, or whether a fortuitous combination of matter
   in conjunction with material laws might not produce the phenomena we
   observe; and therefore these phenomena cease with the combination.
   Among other works, treating upon this subject, I met with Paley's
   Natural Theology Illustrated, which gave a sober, commonsense, bias to
   my mode of reasoning. As a result of this I was cured of atheism and
   infidelity. I now saw the fogs of doubt all clear away, and the
   doctrine of the nature, operations, independence, and perpetuity, of
   the human soul, redeemed from all doubt, and established upon solid
   foundations."

   While he was passing through all this, his mother, hearing of his
   infidelity and abandonment of religion and all thought of entering the
   Christian ministry, became very sad and would not be comforted. Not
   only were her hopes, but her faith also was involved with his. In his
   failure, she saw all her hopes concerning him, from his infancy, dashed
   to the ground. She pined away, and nearly lost her mind in mourning
   over him. She became so weak, that she would stop strangers as they
   passed her door, and ask them in plaintive tones, "Have you seen my
   son, John? Where is he? and what is he about?" Only as a pious mother
   could, she kept his case before God, and quite likely it was in answer
   to her prayers that he was finally brought back not only to Christ, but
   into the work of soul-saving, for which he became so eminent.

   He says, "During the period of my infidelity, I saw and believed that
   human nature needed some kind of religion to restrain it from injuring
   society. For this reason I would attend church, read prayers with the
   congregation, to cultivate a moral tone. I reasoned: If there be a God,
   and the Bible proves true, it is best to be fitted for any possible
   emergency that may arise, even if not contemplated by the Bible. If
   there is no God, or only such an one as the deranged condition of
   nature reveals; if we have nothing to hope beyond the grave, not even
   the guarantee of an abstract existence, the uncertainty is terrible."

   In after years, he would say, "Men may talk of annihilation as a
   possible fact, and regard the theory as a light affair; but let them
   stand where I have stood, by the graves of the long forgotten dead, and
   in imagination pass down the vista of coming time, and think: "With all
   my longing for life, I must lie down in the dust and darkness of the
   tomb, and let the rusty centuries fold over my head, till ages have
   passed and gone, and I sleep on still as these have slept, who now lie
   here in a common ruin, forgotten and forever gone! Poor nameless dust,
   who lived, hoped, feared; made as they thought ample provision for life
   in the spirit land; yet all in vain!" and they will cry out, as I have
   cried, "O God, spare me at least a bare existence." No! I would know
   the truth, however unwelcome it may be."

   His study of anatomy, under the tutorship of an eminent physician, was
   continued after his return to faith, and laid the foundation for his
   future practice of medicine. This struggle with unbelief, and the
   various lines of investigation that it led him to undertake, in mental
   and moral philosophy, as well as in the physical sciences, was a
   valuable training for the especial work to which he was called. Every
   phase of unbelief, mental and moral difficulty seems to have been
   reviewed by him, not simply by reading, but by personal investigation,
   until it seemed that no obstacle of that kind could stand before him.
   "Questions of magnetism, clairvoyance, and much of what now passes for
   spiritualism," were carefully studied by him at that early period
   (between 1830 and 1840). The perfect ease and simplicity with which, in
   the days of his power, he would remove the difficulties of doubt and
   solve the problems of conscience, was an astonishment to those who
   listened to him. From the foregoing account may be seen how these
   problems were worked out in the fierce struggles of his own early
   experience.

   Concerning the period in which he was pursuing these studies he says:
   "During this period my former experience in the Christian life was not
   taken into account. It furnished me with no help whatever. And even
   after this struggle was over, and I began to seek my personal salvation
   again, at first it did not occur to me that I had once been a
   Christian. I commenced entirely anew. When I set about it in good
   earnest I purposed to do it among a people that I thought would not
   annoy me about preaching. But here I found myself mistaken again.
   Scarcely had I obtained a little light on experimental religion before
   the minister whose church I attended, met me in the street one day and
   made an appointment with me to meet him at his house at a certain time.
   When the time came, fearing it was the old subject that was coming up,
   I did not go. When I met him again, he expressed his disappointment at
   my failure to come, and set another time for me. When the time came I
   went, and my fears proved true. Said he: "I have little confidence in
   impressions, but I wish to know for my own satisfaction if you have
   ever been called of God to preach. I wish you to give me a direct
   answer." In my soul I cried out, "My God! am I found out here also?' I
   then frankly answered: "I have." But I stated to him that there were
   barriers now in my way, the principal one of which was a promise to
   marry. This barrier I had placed in the way some time before. My object
   was to create an obligation that would prevent me from entering the
   ministry. This proved to be another great mistake of my life. I was
   soon made to know how surely God could confront me, how terribly he
   could chastise me, and how intensely I could be made to suffer."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 7

   The bitter and sorrowful experience occasioned by his rash marriage
   engagement will be related in Mr. Redfield's own words. Speaking of
   this matter, he says:

   "Gladly would I suppress this chapter of my life, were it not for the
   fact that the cause of Christ has suffered from the misrepresentations
   of it that have gone forth to the world. I might have told my story
   long ago and saved myself much misunderstanding, but I wished not to
   appear as the revealer of my family sorrows. If I had spoken, my
   enemies would have made capital of that, as they have made capital of
   my silence. Now at the close of my life I feel free to speak. I shall
   withhold much of the worse, and only state enough to give a specimen of
   what I have suffered. I ask the candid reader to make the case his own,
   and then ask himself if he would have done better. I have not borne all
   this in silence and alone, refusing to accept of that relief, which
   making known the facts would have given me, and making them known now
   in order to gain sympathy. It is too late for that; my only object is
   to correct unjust imputations on the cause for which I have labored. I
   must, as a last act of my life, do this. What I now give to the world
   of this unfortunate affair, is all that it will ever get, unless
   circumstances shall compel me to give more.

   "I married one whom I thought would make me a happy home. I hired me a
   house at the desire and with the approval of my wife, but within three
   weeks was compelled to abandon it. I found she was no more fit than a
   child to take an interest in or care for a home. I saw no other way
   than to board. I could find but one place where I thought it at all
   proper to board, and that was at her own father's home. But he soon
   told me I must take her away for he could no longer endure her. I hired
   another house. To make it at all possible to keep house I was obliged
   to hire housekeepers, but it was only to have them turned away as fast
   as I could hire them. In one week I hired six in succession and all
   were turned away within that time. I next sent for my sister, who came
   and tried to make my home tolerable; but in a few days I was compelled
   to permit her to go elsewhere to board until she could arrange to go
   home.

   "I next tried to get along by doing the housework myself and hide from
   the world my misfortune; but neglecting to keep my doors fastened, I
   was caught doing my own cooking. When asked of the whereabouts of my
   wife, I could not tell, for I did not know. The fact of my being alone
   and doing my own cooking soon reached the ears of her parents, who,
   mortified by their daughter's conduct, attempted to bring about a
   reform. I had kept all this to myself, not even telling them. Her
   father, learning that she often came to his home, and left me to do the
   work in mine, forbade her coming again without me. Of this I was
   ignorant for a long time.

   "Late one night she told me she was going home and I must accompany
   her. I replied: "It is late, and your people will be in bed. I cannot
   go and disturb them, as there is no urgent need." I then locked the
   door, put away the key and went to bed.

   "I was soon aroused by the fall of a window. I immediately arose, and
   saw she was out of the house, and with a light in her hand was passing
   through the back way, going to her father's house. I knew now there was
   fresh trouble for me. So, I staid up awaiting the results. I soon heard
   a heavy knock at the door. I went to it, opened it, and asked who was
   there and what was wanted. It was her father. Said he, "I will see if
   you are going to turn my daughter out of doors." I had no light, and he
   tried to find me in the darkness. I knew by the tone of his voice that
   he was greatly exasperated, and determined to commit violence upon me.
   I ran into the parlor, and he followed. "Be quiet and calm, until can
   explain to you," I said. But he was too excited to hearken to reason,
   and only knew my whereabouts when I spoke. I could hear his footsteps
   and thereby I kept out of his way. Thus I continued to avoid him until
   he so far cooled down as to pass out and go home. I then closed and
   fastened the door, fully resolved that I would never submit to have her
   return until the matter was fully understood and settled. I cooked my
   breakfast when the morning came, and went out to my business.

   "About 10 o'clock she came and asked my forgiveness, and desired me to
   give her the key to the house. I told her she could not have the key
   until the last night's difficulties were settled. "Well," said she, "go
   down home with me and I will confess it all." So down we went to her
   parents' house. We found them in a very unpleasant mood. I spoke to her
   mother, calling her by that title. She said, "Don't you call me mother
   as long as you treat my daughter as you have."

   "I replied, "Let your daughter tell her own story then."

   "I then asked her, "Did I turn you out of doors?"

   "She answered, "No, sir."

   "Did you not leave the house when I was asleep?' "Yes, sir."

   "Did I know you were going?"

   "No, sir."

   "Did you not climb out of the window as still as possible, so as not to
   awaken me?"

   "Yes,"

   "Then," asked her parents, "why did you say to us, that he turned you
   out?"

   "She answered, "Because you told me never to come home again
   unaccompanied by my husband, unless he should turn me out of doors. I
   made up the story so you would let me stay."

   "Now the whole indignation turned against her, until she called upon me
   to protect her. I felt sorry for her father, for if he got the right of
   a matter he had generosity and Christianity enough to induce him to do
   right. I could but feel that through this whole affair he was an
   honorable and right-minded man.

   "I now permitted her to return. But the same state of things continued.

   "Next I was suddenly called upon by a church committee to investigate
   matters that could not be tolerated longer. I said to them "Go on and
   find out all you can, for I am ignorant of the object of your
   investigation."

   "I permitted her to tell her own story uncorrected. They found it
   entirely a matter of misrepresentation. She confessed the whole to be
   false. She had reported that I would not make any provision for her
   wants. That I had starved her by not providing the necessaries of life.
   When the committee found plain bread, meat, and all kinds of provisions
   in abundance, her mother greatly mortified, asked her how long these
   things had been in the house, she answered,

   "I have never been out of them."

   "Then, what could you mean thus to report what is false?"

   "Oh!" said she, "I wanted some oysters, and he said he could not find
   them, and I didn't believe him." The committee knew it was the season
   when there were none in the market.

   "Again, her mother, deeply mortified, upbraided her severely, when she
   turned to me for protection, saying, "I wonder how you can live with
   me?"

   "I was exonerated by the committee of course, and one of them said to
   me, "No one can blame you if you leave that woman, for such conduct is
   past all forbearance."

   "But all I could do was to wait for deliverance in God's time. Nothing
   but the consciousness that I was enduring the result of my own
   disobedience made my case endurable. And my conscientiousness would not
   allow me to take legal steps to get rid of her.

   "I was now taken violently sick, and was brought nigh unto death. It
   was the first of the cholera season, and I was the only one afflicted
   with the disease in that section who survived. I passed into what is
   called the stage of collapse; but I felt, I have not yet done my work,
   and I cannot die. I then felt, I shall not die. Shortly after this I
   was restored to health.

   "Still my family trouble continued. Now and then my wife would have a
   religious streak. One night after making a great disturbance and giving
   me a terrible scolding, she suddenly turned upon me and commanded me to
   pray as her father prayed. To this I replied, "I cannot think of
   mocking God by any mixture of prayer with such wicked and violent
   manifestations of temper." I saw she took it in ill part, but I thought
   it best to drop the matter and go to rest, still keeping a disguised
   but vigilant watch of her. When she supposed me to be asleep, I saw her
   come near enough to me to get a clear view of me and how and where I
   lay. She then took the light and set it back so it would not shine in
   my face. I could see her movements, however, all the better. She then
   went to the fireplace and took up a pair of heavy brass-mounted tongs,
   and taking a good hold of them with both hands, she came softly within
   a few feet of me, and then darted upon me with great fury and began to
   strike with heavy blows at my head. Having seen the whole operation, I
   was prepared for it; and by holding the bedclothes over my face and
   head, I received the blows upon my arms.

   "For some time after, I felt I had reason to fear much more violence
   from her. I kept up a vigilant watch, but unbeknown to any one else. I
   could not inform even her own parents of this, much less others.

   "Several times, by accident or intentionally, she burned up her
   dresses, and then came to me and demanded more. I think her mother must
   have known that she burned them; for once she came to me and asked me
   to furnish her with one or two cheap ones to keep peace. Then when I
   did this the mother made a fuss about it, and went among their
   relatives with a subscription to buy her daughter a more expensive
   suit, declaring that I refused to dress her in a becoming manner.

   "When my friends came to see me she would tell them to leave for they
   could not be harbored there. My troubles had now become so great, and
   having none to whom I could tell them, I cried, "O Lord, my punishment
   is greater than I can bear." I was unfit for business, and in short was
   so broken in spirit that I could not attend to business as it was
   necessary to do, and was obliged to fail. I gave up all I had to the
   last chair and spoon. I had nothing left. I could not hire a room, nor
   would my wife stay if I did.

   There was only one place where I could procure shelter for the night,
   and that was her father's house. What to do or where to turn was more
   than I could tell. I might have found some employment, but no place for
   permanent board, as no one would board my wife. Her father would only
   engage to board her until we could leave town and rid them the
   mortification to which they were subject on her account. I believe they
   felt truly sorry for me when they saw me in this distressed condition.
   They advised me to take up some business with which I could travel and
   hoped that my wife being among strangers might do better. I borrowed
   money enough to get out of town, and went where she was not known, and
   soon procured a place to board; but shortly I saw from the deportment
   of the people that something was amiss. I knew my only way was to keep
   perfectly still and wait for matters to develop. We had staid in this
   place about four weeks when the lady of the house informed me that we
   could not stay longer. I found this had come from misrepresentations of
   me. I had known it was going on, but I had thought it best not to
   attempt to correct it until I was compelled to; for I utterly despised
   the man who would reveal the afflictions to which he was subjected by a
   bad wife. When the truth came out the lady of the house expressed her
   sympathy for me, and said "You are welcome to stay as long as you
   please, but I cannot have my house so disturbed by that woman; you must
   take her away." I secured another place but could stay only one week. I
   then procured a team and took her some thirty or forty miles away among
   strangers again. I found a place in a genteel family. Here we staid
   twelve weeks.

   "I soon saw that something was going wrong, but waited again for
   developments to indicate my course of action. It continually became
   more evident that my time was coming to a close. One day the lady said
   to me: "Such has been the reports by your wife concerning you that I
   have believed you to be a bad man. But I have found out where the
   trouble lies, and though I deeply sympathize with you in your
   affliction, yet, we can endure her no longer." Of course I expected
   this, and I could not blame them for turning me into the street. What
   to do I could not tell; houseless and homeless, and almost without
   money and no place to get board where my wife was known, I must leave
   town to find a place for shelter. So we took stage to a place about
   fifty miles away. Here we got board in a public house; but after only a
   few hours she positively refused to stay a day or a night. Now I did
   not know what to do. Finally I said to myself: I will try one more
   experiment; I will take her to my father's house; her own father will
   not take her, and every boarding house refuses to keep her or bear with
   her. I took the next stage and brought her to my father's. I went on
   some fifty miles farther, and here my funds were exhausted and I was in
   great distress of mind though I managed to hide my sufferings from
   others. I soon found that my good old father and mother could not
   endure her conduct, and they told me I should not live with such a
   woman. I felt this was my last experiment and if this failed the Lord
   knows I don't know what to do next. I saw nothing but agony and the
   poorhouse as the final winding-up of my calamity. My spirit utterly
   sank within me. I was advised to leave her and get a bill of
   divorcement from her; but while I was in this suspense, and wondering
   what to do next, all at once she resolved to go home to her father's
   house and demanded the money to go with. My funds were exhausted, but
   she insisted on going, and actually started on foot for a hundred miles
   through mud and snow. When I found she was fully bent on going I went
   after her, and promised to see if I could send her in any way. So I
   sold my watch to pay for the hire of a horse to carry her home. I took
   care not to go myself. Now I felt a little relief at being free for a
   short time of my trouble. Very soon, however, a letter came from her
   father saying she was very penitent and sorry for having left me, and
   would promise to change her conduct if I would take her back. I wrote
   back that I had suffered enough, and tried experiments enough, and I
   could do no more. I felt that the last bond of attachment had snapped,
   and that if the offense of not living with her should bring me to the
   state's prison I would go there.

   "In the spring I started for the West. I passed through the place where
   her father lived, and where she then was; but I could not bear the
   thought of seeing her. So I passed on about three hundred miles, and
   located in Lockport, N. Y. After I was settled, I wrote to her father,
   to let him know where I was, and to inquire after the wretched woman.
   And now he beset me to take her back, saying he believed she would
   behave herself. I wrote back that I had no confidence in her reform,
   and could on no condition take her back. I was finally overcome by his
   entreaties, however, and thought it might be possible after all that
   she would do better, as she had professed to become religious. So I
   wrote him that he might bring her about half way, and I would meet him
   and her there, and would make one more trial. I went in due time to the
   place and found them there. I took her to my place of residence and to
   make all as favorable as possible for a successful trial we went to a
   first-class hotel to board. We staid one night only when she pointblank
   refused to stay any longer. So off I went and found a private boarding
   house. Before the week ended she was turned out into the street. The
   lady of the house forbade her returning on any terms. She said to me,
   "You are an unfortunate man, and are welcome here as long as you wish
   to stay; but that woman must not come in at all. A lady of the place
   helped us to obtain another boarding place, and we found shelter for
   the night. We had staid here but a few weeks when I was again warned to
   leave. I pleaded to be permitted to stay from day to day until I could
   write to her father and ask what could be done.

   "The lady of the house told me she was a bad woman, for she had seen
   men follow her off into by-places. I could not say anything in her
   defense for I had found her once in the embrace of one of the boarders,
   and another who thought me to be away came in the night to my room. He
   tried to excuse himself as best he could, but I believe him to have
   been none too pure for the commission of great evil. I told her how
   improperly she was acting, in taking such liberties, when she gave me
   to understand that she should do as she pleased without my consent.

   "Not knowing what to do or where to go, I was nearly distracted. I was
   again informed that she must leave the house. Suddenly she said she
   would go home to her father's; and I must take her to the boat, about
   fifteen miles away. I did so, but when we arrived at the place the boat
   was gone and no other would go until the next week. I must take her
   back; but there was no place to stay for a single night, except at a
   public house. I thought I will at least have one more night in which to
   contrive what course next to take. In the morning we started back to
   the place we had left, and she promised to let me take a room and keep
   house, and she would not leave me; but just before we entered the
   village, she suddenly resolved she would not stay, but would go home at
   once, and I must take her that night to Rochester where she could take
   the cars. I knew it was useless to attempt to persuade her to stay even
   for the night. So I borrowed the money and we left that night in the
   stage. When we arrived at Rochester, I gave her the money to pay her
   fare all the way home. As soon as she had gone I felt such a sense of
   relief that I fainted, and could with great difficulty stagger along to
   a place where I could lie down. A high nervous fever set in, and for
   fifteen days I was not able to be moved. A physician, like a good
   Samaritan attended me faithfully, whom I owe a debt of gratitude which
   I can never pay. I sank lower and lower until I was near death. Two
   consulting physicians came to visited me. They told my nurse, I must
   die, and they most make ready to bury me in two days. They told the
   people where I was staying that my sickness must have been caused by
   some deep trouble. I knew not their decision, but I saw them leave me
   to my fate.

   "The old subject of duty now came up, and I inwardly felt, God will not
   permit me to die; I shall live to preach the gospel. At once I began to
   mend. In a few days after they left me to die I walked into the
   doctor's office. They stared at me as though I had come out of the
   grave. They then told me the conclusion of their council."

CHAPTER 8

   No way is so long but that it has an end, and no night is so dark but
   that the dawn of day at last dispels the darkness. Even so the end of
   some of Mr. Redfield's sorrowful experiences was drawing near, and
   better days were soon to dawn upon his pathway, as the sequel, related
   in his own words, will show. Continuing the narrative, he says:

   "When I was able to ride, I returned to the place of my late residence.
   My long absence had induced the people to believe that I had run away,
   and the man with whom I boarded had taken all my possessions, with an
   absconded debtor's writ. When he learned the cause of my prolonged
   absence, however, he returned me all my property without cost. Next I
   was waited upon by a committee from the church to know how my moral
   character stood. I learned that I had been accused of keeping a bad
   woman in town under pretense that she was my wife; that I had never
   been married to her; and that I knew her to be corrupt. But I was able
   to convince the committee that I was indeed unfortunate but not
   criminal; that I was indeed married. I was at once restored to the
   confidence of the church.

   "A lawyer learning the circumstances of my misfortune, came to me and
   offered to procure me a divorce free of expense. But my lacerated,
   timid spirit could not consent to go through all the details of
   litigation.

   "Now that I was free from this great trouble, my former impressions of
   duty came upon me with redoubled force, and I longed for an abode away
   from the busy world of mankind, and resolved to find me a home like a
   hermit in the wilderness, where I might serve God, commune with nature,
   and at last lay my bones to rest in some lonely place unseen and
   unknown by man. I did go into rooms by myself, and but for neglected
   duty, which it seemed to me must now be forever abandoned, I should
   have been comparatively happy; but it seemed to me that my afflictions
   must prove an obstacle in my way. I thought, everybody will find out
   that I have had family trouble and will feel at liberty to make out of
   it what capital they please; and how can I preach when I am thus marked
   with suspicion? I could have set all things right in the eyes of the
   honest and well-meaning, but I could not bear to go over the facts of
   my sufferings for that purpose. No! I must forever abandon the idea of
   preaching. Yet, I must meet God at last and answer for the neglect of
   duty. Night and day, for a number of years, I silently brooded over my
   sad state, and tried all means in my power to banish the scorpion
   stings of a guilty conscience. "You knew your duty but did it not,"
   constantly rang in my ears. A large portion of my time I spent in the
   grove near by weeping before God.

   "I would sometimes go to the church on Sunday, but the sight of a
   gospel minister would make me writhe with agony, and compel me to
   leave. I would then resort to the woods and there weep and pray for
   deliverance. Yet I kept this all buried in my heart. If I saw a
   minister in the street my eyes would follow him as long as I could see
   him, and, choked with emotion, I would sigh over my own unhappy state.

   "I began to be impressed at one time that I should never see my father
   and mother again in the flesh. So strongly did this come that I shrank
   from going to the post office for fear of finding the sad tidings that
   they had passed away. On going and finding no letters at all, it would
   be with a sense of relief. I prayed that I might be permitted to see
   them again. An answer seemed to come, "You shall." The fall came and I
   went to the city of New York to spend the winter. I procured my winter
   quarters and began a course of study in the fine arts. I now felt a
   strong impression to go immediately to my father's home. I had felt
   perfectly at ease as to the health of my parents from the witness I
   received that I should see them again. I promised myself that I would
   take the steamboat the last of the week, and go home. It was about two
   hundred and fifty miles. But I was so urged by my impression to go that
   I decided to start a day earlier than I first intended. Still that did
   not seem to be satisfactory, and finally I resolved to take the first
   boat. I did so and arrived home just one day before my mother died. Her
   last rational word was, in effect, "I could die in peace if my son
   would do his duty." She was then dying of apoplexy. I watched my
   opportunity to go to her dying bed when we could be alone, and tried to
   arouse her, but I got no response. I took hold of her, and said,
   "Mother, do speak to me once more." I wanted to tell her I would obey
   the call of God to preach the gospel; but she was too far gone to
   understand me. Ten days later my dear father fell sick and passed away.

   "I followed them to the tomb, but oh! how my heart did sink on leaving
   them in their last resting place. Memory with a thousand tongues spoke
   of the anguish I had caused that sainted mother. I had so often heard
   her prayers as she pleaded with God to spare her boy and fit him for
   the mission that was awaiting him. I found myself at home after
   father's funeral, by the desolate hearthstone, but so sad at my loss
   that I have never been able to call to mind any of the circumstances.

   "I went almost immediately to visit one of my sisters who lately had
   lost her husband. She was glad to see me, but began at once to urge me
   to promise that I would go and preach the gospel. She said: "You know,
   brother John, that mother has gone to her grave brokenhearted over your
   neglect to obey God. And now this is the last time that I shall ever
   see you on earth, and I want you to promise meet you will do your duty,
   and let me carry that promise to mother."

   "But," said I, "I shall visit you again next week."

   "No," she said, this is the last time we shall meet on earth, so you
   must promise."

   "Her appeals in mother's name broke me down, and to get rid of her
   importunity, I made a promise which she construed to mean all that she
   desired, and then she said: "Come, brother, let us get down and ratify
   it before God." Of course I knelt, and she poured out her soul for me
   in tones and words that stung me to the quick. We arose, and I left her
   house expecting to visit her again the next week; but on going to the
   post office I found a letter calling me to go immediately six hundred
   miles away as an important witness in court. I obeyed the summons, and
   my sister's words proved true. I never saw her again. I learned in
   about a month from the time I saw her last, that she, too had passed
   away to the spirit land.

   "I was very sad because of these repeated desolations in the loss of my
   dearest earthly friends, but conscience bade me be still and know that
   God was dealing with me in mercy in permitting me to live, and that in
   view of the possibility that I might yet do my duty."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 9

   Mr. Redfield soon returned to his bachelor's hall again. It must have
   been a curiosity shop indeed. Shelves covered the walls on all sides.
   These shelves were loaded with geological specimens, freaks of nature
   in wood and stone, Indian relics and mechanism of his own invention.
   Two mice, bound with delicate chains of his own manufacture, which fed
   and sported and slept at their pleasure, were his only companions.

   Here he secluded himself from the world and Christian friends lest some
   of them should mention the subject of preaching the gospel. Neither he
   nor they could let the subject alone. His presence impressed them with
   the subject, and his sore heart kept it upon his own mind whether
   sleeping or waking.

   One day he met the Methodist preacher in the street, who began
   immediately to urge him to consent to go to work in the vineyard of the
   Lord. He tried to avoid it by arguing both himself and the minister to
   another conclusion. He had held an exhorter's license for some time,
   which had been crowded upon him against his will, but he had never used
   it. The minister now asked that he might present his case to the
   leader's meeting for a recommendation for a license to preach. A strong
   and abiding impression seized him that unless he consented he would be
   killed by lightning. It seemed to him utter foolishness to allow
   himself to be swayed by any such thing; especially in a matter of such
   moment. His past experiences of a similar nature helped this impression
   to take the firmer hold upon him. It haunted him day and night for a
   long time. When the terrible thunder storms which frequently passed
   over would arise, and especially in the night, all his peace and rest
   and sleep would be at an end until the storm ceased. He would resort to
   all the precautionary measures that his knowledge of the laws of
   electricity would suggest to him, as opening the windows and giving a
   free circulation of air through the room, setting a chair in glass
   tumblers and sitting in it with the feet upon the rounds, and then pray
   and tremble until the storm was over. The familiar acquaintances of the
   man can fully appreciate this.

   This state of mind lasted for some weeks, when one night his fears
   became so great that he promised most fervently, that if God would
   relieve him, he would present his case himself to the leaders' meeting
   on the first opportunity to do so. In an instant, when the storm was at
   its highest, his request was granted, and he went to rest and sleep, as
   calmly as ever in his life.

   The Friday evening after, the leaders were to meet, and he went to
   redeem his pledge. The meeting was held in the basement of the church.
   When a suitable opportunity came, he arose and stated his feelings. He
   was about to retire as usual in such cases, when he was stopped by one
   of the members and asked how he stood on the question of abolitionism.
   This question was then greatly agitating the Methodist Episcopal
   Church. He answered, "I am an abolitionist of the strongest type."

   "Then I shall oppose the recommendation." said the brother.

   He earnestly hoped they would not grant the recommendation, for that,
   he thought, would release him; and to make it doubly sure, he now said,
   " I wish it distinctly under stood that if I am granted a license to
   preach, and that shall add anything to the influence I now possess, I
   shall certainly use it for God and the slave. So now your eyes are open
   and you know what I am and what to expect."

   Again it was remarked, "We shall contest the matter."

   He retired, and immediately the vote was taken, and the recommendation
   was granted. The meeting adjourned, and before they had hardly reached
   their homes the church was struck with lightning. This made a profound
   impression upon him, and when soon after, the quarterly conference
   convened, he was ready to be examined according to discipline. The
   license was granted, but when it was handed to him, he felt he could
   not use it.

   He was in constant dread of his wife's returning, for he believed he
   could do nothing with her. He was also in constant fear that the tongue
   of slander would break out upon him in regard to his family matters,
   and that the more certainly if he began to preach. He used the license
   for a few times, and was urged to go upon a circuit as a supply. He
   consented to this for a short time, and though pressed to continue, he
   refused. He also refused to accept of any compensation for his
   services. He not only shrank from the responsibilities of the sacred
   office, but also from the very name of a Christian minister, and pay
   for his services implied that. He finally gave up preaching altogether,
   and went to Cleveland, Ohio, for the winter.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 10

   In Cleveland, Mr. Redfield engaged in his chosen profession -- portrait
   painting. He gave in his letter to the church, and was enrolled as a
   local preacher. Now and then, he preached as called upon by the pastor,
   and during the following winter assisted in a protracted meeting. His
   labors were owned of God in the conversion of souls.

   By invitation he supplied the pulpit of the Seaman's Bethel one Sunday
   in the absence of the stated preacher. When the hour came he found the
   house full. He resolved to do his whole duty. While speaking against
   gambling, swearing, horse racing and drunkenness, one cried out from
   the congregation, "Do you mean me? Do you mean me?" He instantly
   replied, "If that is your case, I certainly mean you." When the
   services closed the deacon who had invited him to preach said to him,
   "That was a very sad mistake, and you have done us a great wrong." And
   then, as if to spare his feelings, he excused the matter thus:

   Our minister, I don't think is quite right. He knows they will do these
   things of which you spoke, but he never reproves them, or speaks
   against such conduct, and they are all bound up in him. Sometimes I
   think he does not go far enough, but you went entirely too far. And
   besides this, many of these are rough sailors and they will not bear
   reproof.

   Shocked at this, Mr. Redfield turned away with a thankful heart that he
   was not more closely identified with such a state of things, and
   resolved that what work he did for the Lord should be faithfully done.

   Soon after this his pastor asked him for his views on the slavery
   question. The answer was, "I am an abolitionist from head to foot."
   "Then," asked he, "would you be willing to give us a lecture on the
   subject? Our hands are tied by a vote of the conference which forbids
   the preachers meddling with the question; yet the colonizationists make
   it a point to create all the prejudice against us they can, until some
   people think we are the vilest disorganizers in the land. I am not
   allowed to speak for the poor dumb slave under pain of conference
   penalties. And it does seem that those who dare should be permitted to
   speak the sentiments of the antislavery part of the church. There are a
   number of strong abolitionists in the city who would be glad to stand
   by any one who dares to take a firm stand; but they have not the
   courage to take a stand themselves unless some one takes the lead and
   meets the brunt of the opposition, which is sure to come, when an
   antislavery society is started."

   Mr. Redfield promised the preacher to lecture, feeling glad that he had
   nothing too good to sacrifice in such a cause.

   The appointment for the lecture was made. When the time came, a mob had
   collected, nailed up the doors of the building in which the lecture was
   to be given, and were waiting for the lecturer himself. He felt it was
   no compromise of right or conscience to avoid an infuriated mob, when
   by no possibility could he get a hearing.

   His quiet retirement aroused the better element of society, who were
   not prepared to surrender the right of free speech in a free state to a
   mob. A demand was therefore made that the house be opened, and Mr.
   Redfield given an opportunity to present the views of the
   abolitionists. The plea was made that the colonizationists had free
   opportunity to misrepresent the abolitionists, and it was no more than
   right that the latter have an opportunity to reply. Another appointment
   was then made.

   Before the time came round, Mr. Redfield had the opportunity to prepare
   himself more perfectly for the occasion. The opposition to the first
   meeting created a deeper and wider interest to hear him. It also
   aroused him to see more clearly the terrible sinfulness of the slavery
   feeling in this country, and to make the stronger effort against it.

   Mr. Redfield's lecture gave a synopsis of the slave codes in each
   State; the attempts of humanitarians in these states to ameliorate the
   condition of the slaves; and the facts recited in the preambles of the
   bills presented in the different legislatures for this purpose. These
   referred to the taking of the lives of slaves; robbing female slaves of
   their virtue; and the overworking and starving of field hands. He then
   called attention to the extent and the manner in which these laws were
   disobeyed, and the advantage that masters took of their legal powers.
   He read extracts from Southern papers to illustrate the foregoing, one
   of which was as follows:

   "RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER.

   "My slave, Sally, who, without doubt, is lurking about the plantation
   of Mr._____, in Georgia, as I sold her husband to that gentleman about
   eighteen months ago. She has been very sullen ever since. She will try
   to pass herself off as a white woman, as she is very white and
   beautiful spoken, and very capable of putting on the airs of a white
   lady. Fearing she might run away I took the pains to mark her by
   knocking out two of her front teeth and branding her on the buttocks
   with the letter S. She is likewise much scarred with the whip on her
   neck and shoulders. Her legs are torn by the dogs, done in catching her
   fifteen months ago. Her left thumb has the mark of a rifle ball where I
   shot her before she would surrender."

   This was followed by recitals of cruelty, bloodcurdling to read at the
   present day.

   Mr. Redfield's audience was large and many present were members of the
   mob which gathered at the time of the other appointment. He observed
   before he was through that the opposition began to yield, and the mob
   spirit to quiet down. He had expected that an attack would be made upon
   him before he was through, but all remained quiet.

   He finished the lecture with a picture in which the actors were
   reversed. The scene was in Algeria. The slaves were Americans. The same
   scenes were enacted as read from the Southern advertisements. He then
   appealed to their sense of justice and honor. He finished by
   representing himself as hazarding his reputation and life by pleading
   for those supposed Americans in Algeria, and asking his audience if now
   they thought him worthy of tar and feathers and other maltreatment. He
   waited for the mob to make a demonstration, inviting them to do so if
   they thought it right, but all remained quiet. He then said: "If you
   think the cause is worthy of support, we will form an antislavery
   society." Nearly all present were then enrolled as members. This was
   the first organization of the kind made in the city.

   Soon after the lecture and the organization of the society, he was
   called upon to put his principles in practice. Cleveland was a point on
   the underground railroad where many fugitives from slavery took their
   departure from the United States, where they were unsafe, to the
   Dominion of Canada where they would be safe. It was a criminal act,
   according to the law of the land, to harbor or assist a fugitive slave.

   One Sunday evening he observed in the congregation at church a tall,
   straight, well-built and genteel appearing man, who, with hymnbook in
   hand, took part in the worship. The hue of his skin and the wavy
   ringlets of his hair showed him to be one of the despised race which
   the law of the land and the unwritten creed of some of the churches had
   declared had no rights that white men were bound to respect.

   Shortly after nightfall the same manly form came to Mr. Redfield's
   lodgings, and in great agitation said: "O sir, save me! I am in great
   trouble! Will you help me?"

   "I will, if I can," answered Mr. Redfield, "but tell me first what is
   the matter."

   O sir," said the stranger, "I am a slave. A large reward has been
   offered for me; and I learn that there is a man in the city looking for
   me to take me back into slavery."

   "Come in," said Mr. Redfield, "and you will be perfectly safe. My
   windows are all shut, fastened and blinded, and I will fasten the
   door."

   "But what if they break in?" the fugitive asked.

   "I will do the best I can at all cost to defend you?' replied Mr.
   Redfield; "sit down and tell me your story. Why did you run away? Were
   you badly treated?"

   "Oh, no!" he answered. "In the first place, I belonged to a man who
   died some years ago. His widow married again, and before the legal
   heirs could put in their claim to their portion of the estate my new
   master desired to sell me. Of all this I knew nothing until one day
   while I was working in the tanyard cleaning out a vat ( I had been
   hired out to a tanner, for I was a tanner by trade,) shoveling out the
   old bark and singing a Methodist hymn as I worked, I thought I heard a
   voice saying, "You are sold." I straightened up and looked around, but
   saw no one. I went on with my work again, still singing a favorite
   hymn. The same voice came again, "You are sold." I sprang out of the
   vat and looked for the author of the dreadful sound, but in vain. I
   went to work again, determined to banish my fears. But the same voice
   said again, "You are sold." I looked again, and at a distance I saw my
   master in company with a stranger walking leisurely around the tanyard.
   I knew then that voice was correct. The thought, I will be torn and
   forever separated from my wife and child, now rushed upon me, and with
   it a sense of the wrong about to be perpetrated on us. I instantly
   resolved: "I will die first." I kept an eye out, and went on with my
   work. They gradually drew nearer and nearer until they stood at my
   back. As I lifted a shovelful of bark one of them asked, "Shall I not
   help you lift it out?" Instinctively knew that this meant to tie my
   hands while I was holding them up. Blind to all consequences, and with
   the nerve of a madman, I sprang out of the vat and raised my shovel in
   self-defense. Instantly they both drew pistols, and bade me surrender
   or die. I cared not a fig for death, I was so aroused by the sense of
   the wrong they were doing me. But the thought came, "It is no use to
   contend; they have the law on their side and can do what they please
   with me. I must submit like my Saviour. I must resist not, but endure
   for his sake. It was my conscience and not my fear that subdued me. It
   told me to look to the future and t o God for the settlement of my
   troubles. I then let them tie my hands behind me with a long rope. They
   then gave a loud whistle which was answered by a man coming to us, to
   whom they gave me in charge. He took hold of the rope and commanded me
   to walk on. He took me to a place by the roadside where there were
   about fifty more slaves, tied together, preparatory to being taken down
   the river to be sold again. When we had got away from the two men I
   asked the one who had me in charge to let me go and see my wife and
   child before I was separated from them forever.

   "No," said he, with a terrible oath, you shall not. Your wife would
   make a fuss, and you will feel a great deal worse. You had better make
   up your mind never to see them again."

   "Oh, I was so heavy with grief that my feet seemed to slump into the
   ground at every step. Suddenly, with all my might I gave a wrench to
   the rope, and so loosed my hands, and, being much stronger than he, I
   pulled him right up to me, and then said, "I shall go and see my family
   before we are parted forever." When he saw I had him in my power, with
   another oath, he said, "Well, you may go, but it will be the worse for
   you."

   While thus narrating his story, this noble specimen of man would
   falter, choke, and struggle with the grief which was yet rending his
   heart. Then again he would nerve himself to continue the narration.

   "Finally," said he, "we reached the cabin of my family, and as soon as
   my wife saw me, with a shriek she fell upon the floor, and my poor
   heart seemed to break worse than before. As I was compelled to hasten,
   I picked up a few articles of clothing, tied them up in a bundle, and
   kissed my wife and boy for the last time. Oh! how my brain reeled as I
   turned to leave them, forever. I felt that sense of my feet sinking
   into the earth again, at every step, as I walked away. I was now
   hurried back to the coffle of slaves, and was soon bound by one of my
   wrists to the chain, which ran the whole length of the gang. The driver
   being in a hurry urged us on, to the top of our speed. My rough old
   shoes that I wore in the tannery soon so galled my feet that the blood
   ran out at every step. We reached the river that night and were taken
   into a tavern at the landing. We were all put up in the garret, which
   was made like a jail, with grated windows, for the accommodation of
   slave-traders.

   "Soon the whole gang were asleep. Some cried themselves to sleep, some
   were sullen and apparently careless as to what became of them, for the
   last tie had been broken and the last hope had fled. Others were so
   gross and stupid that they fell asleep from want of energy and life to
   keep them awake; like beasts when out of reach of the lash, they were
   at rest. It was raining hard without, and the patter upon the roof and
   the splashing upon the ground, made it difficult to hear other sounds.
   When I thought all were sound asleep, I walked carefully around the
   room. I put my hand upon a rope, which I found to be a clothes-line,
   for the family used the garret to dry clothes in when not in other use.
   I went to a window, and with an old jack-knife which I had to use about
   the tanyard, I dug out of the wall one end of an iron bar, and that
   made a place just large enough for me to squeeze through. I then
   fastened one end of the clothes line to another bar, threw out my
   little bundle of clothing, carefully climbed out, and ventured my
   weight upon that frail rope. I heard one of the strands break, and
   expected to fall to the ground the next moment; but it held me until I
   reached the end. I had not reached the ground by a number of feet,
   when, as I hung there, I saw a door open and some one passing in. For a
   moment all my fears were aroused, thinking I was discovered. But they
   did not see me in the darkness, and I only saw them by the light of the
   open door. The rain was still pouring down. I now let go my hold and
   dropped to the ground. I carefully felt around until I found my bundle,
   and then made my way to a stream of water near by, and waded it a long
   distance, that the hounds might be unable to follow me. The stream led
   me in the direction from whence I came. I followed it until about
   daybreak, and then hid in the woods until night, when I started again
   for home. The succeeding morning I came in sight of my little home
   again. From fear of frightening my dear wife, and arousing some slaves
   who slept in part of the cabin , I went cautiously to a little window,
   and in a low tone of voice, called:

   "Liza!"

   With a scream she cried out, "O my God! that's my Thomas! O Thomas!
   Thomas! the patrol will kill you!"

   "I said, "Hush! Liza, keep still, and we will manage some way."

   "I went into the cabin and climbed up into the little garret through a
   hole over a door between the two rooms. My wife put up a box on to the
   door casing to hide a part of the hole through which I had passed. When
   it was fairly daylight, the patrol, who had heard of my escape, came to
   the cabin and asked Liza if I had got back. She answered, "No! I have
   not seen him since he left with the slave trader." This was literally
   true, for it was dark when I came.

   "The patrol kept such a close watch that I dared not go out anywhere.
   So I concluded to change my place of concealment, and started in the
   night for my mother's, some four miles away, where she was owned. Lest
   I should startle her, I went to her window, and in a low voice, asked,
   Aunt, is uncle at home?' She knew my voice, and knew I had run away,
   and that the patrol was after me. She cried out, Oh! it is my poor boy,
   Tommy! O Tommy! Tommy! the patrol will kill you!' She let me into the
   cabin, and we took up a board of the floor, and I laid down on the
   ground, and she put the board back again. Here I could stay until the
   patrol would pass on to the next beat, and then I would come out and
   stretch myself.

   "My wife's and mother's cabins were watched closely. I changed my
   hiding place from under the floor to the garret, which was reached by a
   ladder. As my mother could have my boy with her without suspicion, I
   had the mournful consolation of caressing him often.

   "I resolved at last that I would come North as soon as I could with
   safety; but so closely was I watched, that I was compelled to hide
   under the floor and in the garret, at mother's, for thirteen months. By
   this time I was so completely bleached out, and my skin was so fair,
   that after mother got me some women's clothes, I was able boldly to
   take the stage as a white woman and make my escape without detection.
   When I had reached a section where I was not known, I got out and went
   into the woods and put on my men's clothing. I then traveled nights and
   slept daytimes until I reached a free state. I lived on corn, fruits
   and such other things as I could help myself to. After a long time I
   found myself in this state.

   "I now felt so badly about my wife and child that at last I ventured to
   get a white man to write to my master for me, that if he would allow me
   to live with my family I would go back and give him my labors for the
   rest of my life. He wrote me in reply that he would have me any way and
   he would do as he pleased. When this hope failed I resolved to go
   myself and by some means bring my wife and child away. So I turned my
   face toward the land of bondage again. I traveled nights and slept
   daytimes in the woods, until I came in sight once more of my little
   cabin. When I got inside I found my little one was dead and buried. My
   heart was nearly broken again. With my wife I started again for the
   land of freedom. We passed the patrol and entered the woods. It was
   night; but my poor wife had become so nervous and broken by the long
   struggle with her wrongs that the least unusual sound or the breaking
   of a twig would cause her to cry out, The patrol is coming! the patrol
   is coming!' I carried her in my arms until I s aw I must give up the
   effort, as her fears would be our betrayal, and we should both be taken
   back to bondage. I was obliged to let her return, while I turned my
   steps toward the North again. And now they have got track of me, and
   are in the city after me."

   Mr. Redfield had the privilege of learning that this suffering man
   landed safely in Canada, where colored people had equal rights with
   white people. He knew he was making himself liable to church
   proscription by aiding such suffering followers of Jesus, but he told
   the authorities that he should stand for God and humanity. The laws of
   the state would have sent him to the state's prison for ten years, and
   made him pay a fine of five hundred dollars for sheltering and aiding
   that poor man if his offense had been known; but to use his own words,
   "What had I to do with protecting my own freedom and rights when there
   stood my suffering Jesus in the person of this poor outcast. I seemed
   to hear his voice ringing in my ears, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
   one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me." Yes,
   and I would have done it again if I had known that I certainly would
   have had to suffer both the imprisonment and the fine."

   Mr. Redfield lived during the period of the great antislavery conflict
   in this country. All the different phases of it passed before him. The
   Methodist Episcopal Church, of which he was a member, and within whose
   pale he performed nearly all his ministerial labor, and which he loved
   as he loved his life, he saw hesitate and cringe before the slave
   power, and at last become an agent of persecution against such as could
   not refrain from lifting up their voices against the gigantic wrong.
   His sensitive soul listened with horror to the accounts of proscription
   against such men as Orange Scott, Cyrus Prindle, Luther Lee and others
   of its most devoted ministers. He lived to see a combination formed in
   the General conference of that body, in 1860, [1] that prevented the
   redressing of the grievances that resulted in the organization of the
   Free Methodist Church, and that also prevented the change of the
   general rule on slavery until 1864, when there were no more slaves
   within the bounds of the United States.

   He did not live to see that change of the rule. If he had, the act
   coming at such a time, would have appeared so ungracious to him that it
   could have afforded him no pleasure. If he had lived several
   quadrennials longer, he might have been gratified by witnessing the
   adoption of a resolution by the General conference of that body,
   removing a censure passed upon Orange Scott, by the General conference
   of 1836, for taking part in an antislavery meeting in the city of
   Cincinnati, during the session of that conference. Orange Scott had
   passed into the eternal world, however, long before this relief to his
   memory.

   It is hardly possible for the present generation, though little more
   than a quarter of a century has since passed by, to conceive of a state
   of society in this country such as has been illustrated in this
   chapter; but many there are who have outlived the generation in which
   these cruelties were perpetrated, and who, vividly recalling those
   exciting times, will testify that the picture is in no wise overdrawn.

CHAPTER 11

   Mr. Redfield had now passed one winter in active service for God and
   humanity. Many had been converted. An efficient antislavery society had
   been organized, and nearly fifty fugitives from bondage had been
   assisted in their efforts to reach Canada. He now determined to return
   to Lockport, N. Y., the scene of some of his severest conflicts, and
   where he consented to accept a license to preach the gospel. On his
   return, he was urged to take the place of a preacher who had made
   himself unacceptable by his antislavery views. He accepted the
   position, but soon was equally as unacceptable as his predecessor, and
   for the same reason. He gave up the charge and returned to his
   bachelor's quarters. He now despaired of doing his duty acceptably to
   God, and satisfactorily to himself. The summer was spent in studying
   into the works and ways of God as seen in nature. He gave up the idea
   of going into the work as a traveling preacher. He thought to content
   himself with preaching occasionally, but giving his time mainly to
   business. When he did preach he refused to receive pay for his
   services. The hand of disease had fastened upon him, but still he
   endeavored to keep his conscience free from condemnation, by visiting
   and praying with the people, and exhorting sinners to seek Christ. In
   this he saw some success, but so little was he satisfied with his
   labors, that he was in great distress of mind.

   He was under conviction for and began to seek the experience of entire
   sanctification.

   He says: "I thought that experience would empower me to do my duties
   with greater success and satisfaction. In my ignorance of the true way,
   I wept and mourned before God, and wished to meet with some one who
   could instruct me. I finally became desperate, and resolved to make a
   business of seeking it. I began with a day of fasting and prayer. This
   was followed with a watch-night. I resolved never to close my eyes or
   leave my knees until I could claim the blessing; but nature sank under
   the burden, and I fell to the floor and went to sleep. When morning
   came, I awoke to find myself exhausted and on the floor. When I
   remembered the vows and resolutions I had made the night before, and
   how poorly I had kept my promise, I blamed myself for faithlessness,
   and in tears asked God if I must live another day in this condition.
   Can I be no more like thee than this? I could say from the depths of my
   heart:


   "Tis worse than death my God to love,

   And not my God alone."

   "Again I fasted and kept watch-night. I resolved not to move until I
   either died or gained the great pearl; but being still more exhausted,
   I again sank to the floor and went to sleep, and awoke the next morning
   to upbraid myself for my broken vows. All these struggles only proved
   to me how useless were human plans and will-power to gain what I
   afterward learned must be obtained by faith alone. By the Holy Spirit I
   was led to make a thorough search of self and find to what extent my
   will was in harmony with God's will. Now my mind was brought to face
   the great question with me. I said to myself, how can I think of
   preaching after my troubles with that unfortunate being who has blasted
   every hope of my life! I cannot attempt to regulate public opinion by a
   narration of my sorrows! I shall be misunderstood, and my misfortune
   will be the foundation of a large amount of slander, which will hedge
   up my way. "No, Lord," I said, "I cannot go. I might once have gone
   without impediment, but that day has passed forever. I will do the best
   I can in a private way, but to devote myself to the work of the
   ministry is impossible until I have an honorable discharge from the
   woman who has embittered my life."

   "I now resolved to spend my time in active service for the Lord, but in
   a private way. I commenced visiting the sick, praying with them, and
   pointing them to the Lamb of God. I went to see a young man who was
   very sick, and who had been given up by the counseling physicians, who
   had just left him. While at prayer for him an impression came upon me
   that the young man would not die, and I instantly gave utterance to it.
   I then arose, and taking him by the hand, said to him, You will not
   die. Now give your heart to God and live for him." This he promised to
   do, and I left the house. Two or three brethren who were present and
   heard me make this declaration were distressed at it, for fear of the
   consequences in case it should not prove true. I felt the same, nor was
   I relieved until a short time after when I saw the young man walking
   the street in comparatively good health.

   "Soon after this I was asked to visit another man who had been given up
   to die by his physician, who said he could not live through the night.
   The man insisted that I should be called, and declared he would take no
   medicine from any hand but mine, or by my direction. He had heard of
   the case just narrated, and as soon as I approached his bed he said to
   me, "Don't pray for me to get well, I prefer to die." But the
   impression came to me, and I said to him, "I can pray in no other way,
   for you will certainly get well." The sequel justified this prediction,
   for he did get well.

   "I was called upon by a Class Leader to visit a member of his class,
   then apparently dying with the consumption. It was a cold night in
   March. We found the windows and doors open to give her air. The
   physician had just left, after declaring that she was dying. While I
   was praying with her, as in the other cases, the impression came that
   she would recover. It came this time in such power that it was with
   difficulty that I could repress the utterance of it. On leaving the
   house I said to the leader what I thought. To this he answered, "It is
   a good thing you did not say so, for she is certainly dying. If you had
   said what you felt, the cause of religion would have been greatly
   injured." To the astonishment of all she was able to walk the streets
   in a very few weeks, and lived for a long time after.

   "Another instance, but with a different result, occurred soon after.
   One of the Class Leaders was taken sick, and to all appearance the
   sickness was unto death; but the suggestion came to me with great power
   that the prayer of faith would save the sick. The leader was a man of
   great value to the church, and I felt that he could not be spared. I
   shut myself up in my room, determined if possible to prevail with God
   to raise him up to health. I continued in prayer until the same
   impression came with a slight shade of difference, that the leader
   would live, and not die. But that slight difference in the impression
   made me hesitate to declare that the sick man would recover. Soon after
   the man died."

   These instances made a profound impression upon Mr. Redfield, and led
   him to do some very careful thinking upon the general subject. He says,
   "I then saw that none of these cases were restored by faith. In the
   first three the result was intuitively perceived as a coming fact. In
   the last the impression was on the imagination, prompted by strong
   desire. This experience has been of great benefit to me since then, as
   a gauge by which to test the strong impressions, and to distinguish
   between faith, fancy, and intuition."

   It is difficult to account for these peculiar manifestations and
   successes upon any other ground than that the Lord was preparing him
   for future usefulness -- by the study which these facts induced. He was
   still bent on compromising the matter of his call if he could. He
   resolved to pay the preachers more; he denied himself all luxuries of
   the table, and lived for a season on roast potatoes cooked by his own
   hand that he might give more.

   In the midst of this two young men came to his apartments, and the
   three bound themselves together to pray for a revival of religion. One
   night when they were engaged in prayer the village band met in the
   adjoining room for practice. They each prayed that the music might be
   stopped, and held on until each felt that he had received an answer.
   Soon the music stopped, and they heard the members of the band pass
   down the stairs from the room. This encouraged them to ask for greater
   things. They held on until they each received an answer that God would
   revive his work in the place. The next day they learned that several
   members of the band were awakened the evening before and had been
   inquiring the way of salvation. Soon after the minister commenced a
   protracted meeting, and before it closed about two hundred professed
   conversion. Mr. Redfield now had his hands and heart full, in laboring
   in prayer meetings, and in personal effort with souls. He tried to
   think that he would not have to preach if he proved faithful in this
   manner.

   He became much concerned for the gentleman with whom he boarded before
   he went into bachelor's hall. He was an infidel Sabbath breaker. Mr.
   Redfield had often recommended religion to him in a general way, but
   now he felt that he had not been sufficiently in earnest about it. He
   resolved to do his whole duty at all hazards. The man came into Mr.
   Redfield's room one day, and he took him by the hand and said, "I have
   tried to recommend religion to you by my life and gentleness, but I see
   and feel I have never done my duty to you as I ought, and now I will
   never let go of your hand, nor let you go, until you either repulse me
   or give your heart to God." With deep emotion he said, "The last
   obstacle is now removed. I was a disbeliever in religion until I became
   acquainted with you. I have watched you, and could find but one fault
   in you, and that was, if you really felt friendly to me as you seemed
   to, I could not see how you could believe my soul in danger and not
   compel me to seek religion. But this removes that obstacle. Now," said
   he, with tears in his eyes, "take me to some of your prayer meetings."

   "There was another gentleman," says Mr. Redfield, "an acquaintance and
   friend, whom I had often tried to lead to Christ, but who, with his
   wife, still remained impenitent, and whom I now resolved to visit and
   talk and pray with. I sent word to them that I would come at a certain
   time, and that my object was to talk with them on the subject of their
   soul's salvation. When the time arrived I went to their home and found
   it closed against me. To all appearances they were not at home. Again I
   appointed a time, and again I found the house shut against me. After
   this the gentleman came to my apartments one day, and I stepped to the
   door and locked it, and said, "I will never let you leave this room
   until you promise to seek salvation, or utterly refuse me.' To this he
   answered, "I appreciate your motives, but if it has come to this I must
   tell you distinctly, I shall not make you any such promise." "Very
   well, Lyman, an impression comes to me that God will now visit you with
   judgments." Shortly after this I was called to go to his house to see
   his dying wife. The violence of her disease ended in mortification
   while she was yet living, and had now reached its crisis. When I
   reached the house groups of neighbors were standing here and there
   talking in low tones, and whose manner indicated that the subject was
   more than ordinarily distressing. I passed them, approached the door,
   opened it, and in the first room sat others in melancholy mood. They
   were talking in the same manner as those outside. Now and then a cry of
   agony came through the closed doors of the sufferer's room. The door
   opened, and the eyes of the dying woman met mine. Hers flashed with a
   gleam never to be forgotten.

   "She cried out, "Oh! why did you not come before?"

   "I drew near her and replied, "I have tried, but you closed your door
   against me."

   "Well, then pray for me now," she said.

   "I knelt and tried to pray, but it was in vain; I could not get hold.
   She called upon her attendants to remove her to another room. This was
   done by moving the cot on which she lay. When they set her down she
   raised her mortifying arms toward heaven and uttered the mournful cry,
   "O God! for a few hours to get ready for this awful change." Her arms
   fell and she ceased to breathe. I then approached her distracted
   husband, and asked, "Lyman, will you now yield to God?"

   "He answered, "I cannot now as well as I could before."

   "I replied, "Then God will come again."

   "In a very few days one of his children was called to pass away
   suddenly. I was called again to visit the house of mourning. The father
   was convulsed with grief. On being approached and asked, "Has God done
   enough? Will you now yield?' he answered as before. I then said, "Well,
   God will come once more."

   "In a few days I was called to visit Lyman himself. He appeared to be
   rapidly passing into eternity. He now seemed to have given up the
   controversy and professed to have yielded his heart to God. Still a
   doubt hung over the case that eternity alone can clear up."

CHAPTER 12

   Mr. Redfield was now conscious that disease had fastened its grasp upon
   his own frame. To all appearances he was rapidly sinking under that
   fell disease, consumption. All remedies seemed to fail. He had but one
   hope left, and that was to escape the rigors of winter by going to one
   of the Southern states. A few remedies that he still thought of using
   were packed with his clothing and books, and with a limited purse, he
   started for New York city to take a steamer for the South. On arriving
   at the city, and while waiting for the day of the steamer's departure,
   he met an old friend, who insisted upon his stopping with him during
   the winter. It was urged that there would be sudden changes of weather
   in the South that would seriously affect him; that he might have a room
   at the home of this friend, where he could regulate the temperature as
   he pleased, and he need not go out until spring. He finally accepted
   the kind offer, and soon went into most favorable winter quarters.

   Here he wasted fast with hectic and cough. He was soon so weak and
   emaciated, that he was obliged to lie upon the bed most of the time.
   His room was opposite a Methodist Episcopal church, with a public
   cemetery and vault in the rear. Every day, and sometimes twice and
   thrice a day, funeral processions would pass in and leave the bodies of
   departed ones. In his morbid state of feeling these scenes had a
   strange fascination for him, and he would gaze upon them and think,
   "Thus it will be soon with me."

   On bright and pleasant Sunday mornings he would wrap himself and cross
   over to the church and listen to the sermon. He did not give in his
   church letter, for that stated that he was a local preacher, and he
   might be called upon to preach. His disease gained rapidly and soon it
   was doubtful whether he would live to see the coming summer. His
   marvelous imagination would picture to him scenes of decay, as he
   looked upon his colorless and emaciated hands and his conscience goaded
   and upbraided him because of neglected duty. He often would ask
   himself, "What can I do to soften this terrible punishment, or to
   appease this God who has borne with me so long?" His room often
   resounded with his sobs and crying. He appeared to himself to be too
   far gone with disease to be ever able to perform the duty that lay so
   heavily upon him; yet to die, he felt he could not, he dare not. These
   struggles of mind would bring on profuse sweating, and that would be
   followed with chills, and all seemed to aggravate and hasten the work
   of disease. Yet he was powerless to shake off these thoughts and
   feelings.

   One day his mind recurred to the fact that four times he had been
   raised from the borders of the grave, as he thought, that he might
   preach the gospel, and weak as he was, he immediately knelt and pleaded
   with God for his life. Days went by in which he spent much of his time
   in this manner, but all seemed in vain. At last, despairing of help in
   any other way, he vowed again to do the work God had called him to do.
   He spent the most of one night in prayer, weeping, promising and
   pleading. About three o'clock in the morning the answer came, clear and
   distinct, "You may live while you preach, but no longer."

   From that hour, as we shall see, that declaration was the inspiration
   of his life. Many times, when heart and hope had failed, that assurance
   nerved him to go forward in the conflict. He says, "This single
   sentence has kept me moving for more than twenty year at my own expense
   to toil in the face of all opposition, and hold my tongue and let God
   who sent me settle up all in the final day of reckoning."

   On the Friday evening after receiving this answer to his prayer, he was
   able, by carefully wrapping himself, to attend a love-feast in the
   church across the way. He went designing to present his letter. He had
   been seated but a short time when the minister came and spoke to him;
   and, though they were strangers, asked, "Have you a preacher's
   license?"

   Mr. Redfield answered, "I have."

   "Well, you must preach for me in this church next Sunday morning," said
   the pastor.

   "But, sir, you must excuse me;" rejoined Mr. Redfield.

   The minister would not excuse him, and Mr. Redfield found himself in
   trouble again. All his old questionings arose once more. Some of his
   wife's relatives lived in the city, and they might make him trouble.
   Still there was his promise made to God, and the answer, "You may live
   while you preach, but no longer." At last he answered, "I will try."
   Yet he secretly hoped that he might make so bad a failure of it that he
   would never be called upon again. If anything could happen to cause
   this, for which he would not be responsible, and the cause of God not
   be injured by it, he felt he would be thankful. He had yet to learn
   that the callings of God are without repentance.

   Saturday morning came, and with it the thought that he must try and
   preach on the morrow. He was in a tremor accompanied by alternate
   sweats and chills all day. He begged of God to be released. Thus the
   day was passed. The night came on, with no alleviation to his feelings.
   In speaking of it, he says, "I have often thought I could appreciate
   the feelings of a man about to be executed; how the very hours were
   given tongues to distress his spirit with their suggestions. I went to
   bed, but not to sleep. Occasionally I would begin to lose myself, when
   it would seem to be screamed in my ear, "Preach tomorrow," and I would
   spring up in the bed, and the cold sweat would start all over me. Thus
   the long night passed by."

   Daylight brought him no relief. Sunrise succeeded the dawn, and in due
   time the church bells began to ring. He looked out upon the street and
   saw the people gathering in large numbers to the church. All seemed to
   conspire to make him as miserable as possible. The moment came for him
   to walk over to the church. He started, but with his heart crying out,
   "I cannot." Again the Voice said, "Live while you preach." He reached
   the pulpit, in great distraction of mind, and made some mortifying
   blunders. He arose to give out a hymn, but was too weak to hold up the
   book. He clung to the desk to keep from falling, and had to sit while
   the congregation sang. The prayer over, the lesson read, and another
   hymn sung, he arose to announce his text. An unearthly power seemed to
   sustain him; he had volume of voice, readiness of thought, and freedom
   of utterance. He concluded, but was ashamed of himself and his effort,
   and thought, "This will put an end to invitations to preach." To his
   surprise, however, the preacher said to him, You must preach again,
   naming the evening when his services would be expected. Mr. Redfield
   pleaded to be excused, but the minister was unyielding. Said he, "If
   you refuse, I must lay commands upon you." Had it not been for falling
   into the hands of such a man, it is quite probable that the church
   would never have been stirred by the mighty eloquence of Dr. Redfield.

   On Friday evening, he was again at church. The minister said to him,
   "You must preach Sunday night." Again his soul was on the rack.
   Saturday night was spent in prayer. If he must preach, he must have a
   text and subject. About two o'clock Sunday morning the answer came; but
   with it, another of his strange impressions. The substance of it was
   this: "I will be with you in awful power; but you must open the service
   with the declaration that this night there will be such a display of
   divine power as they have never witnessed; and further, that eternity
   will reveal the fact that the probation of one soul in the congregation
   ends this night, so that it is salvation for that person now or never."
   He well knew that no one who would be present could sympathize with him
   in making such a statement; that it would probably shock the church,
   and if it proved a failure, be disastrous to the cause of Christ. He
   prayed to be relieved from such a duty; and was instantly thrown into
   great darkness and distress of mind. His text and subject seemed all
   confusion, as well as his own relation to Christ. This he could not
   endure. He now pleaded with God to show him what he would have him do,
   and promised to yield all his objections to the divine will. Then the
   answer came again as before. Again he shrank from taking a position
   that seemed so full of presumption; but only to be instantly
   overwhelmed in darkness, and distress of soul. He finally promised to
   obey.

   He went to the Sunday morning service. The noted Dr. Luckey preached.
   When the congregation rose to sing the first hymn, the thought came
   home to him with great power, the doom of one soul will be eternally
   fixed tonight. Such was the intensity of his feelings he had to sit
   down, and hold his hand over his mouth to keep from screaming aloud.
   The natural impropriety of making such a declaration as he felt he must
   make to please God, made his entire nature shrink from the purpose of
   doing it. Thus he alternated between the resolve to do so, and drawing
   back from it through the entire day. In the afternoon Dr. P_____
   preached. The work of the evening was to fall upon him. These great
   preachers occupying the same pulpit, both the same day, did not make
   his cross lighter.

   At the appointed hour he walked over to the church. The house, a large
   one, was densely packed with people, gallery, standing-room, vestibule
   and all. At the last moment he made up his mind to venture all, and
   leave the results with God. At the proper time in a firm, clear voice,
   he said, "You may prepare for the greatest display of God's power that
   you have ever witnessed in this church; besides there is one soul here
   whose probation ends tonight, forever. With that soul it is salvation
   this night or never. I may not be able to prove this true, but that
   soul will tell me in the judgment that this Sunday night, in the year
   of our Lord 1841, was the last of its probation." As soon as he had
   uttered these words he was perfectly relieved. The members were
   shocked, and so great were their fears, as they afterwards confessed,
   that they prayed God to overrule his presumption.

   He then gave out his text and began to preach. An awful sense of the
   divine presence pervaded the congregation. To use his own words, "An
   unearthly power so lifted me up that it seemed to me that my feet only
   touched the earth, while my whole head, heart and body were above the
   skies and in heaven. The thrills of heavenly power which I then felt I
   can never describe. It was a power given me for the occasion, and it
   seemed to me that it could move a nation, or shake a world."

   He had not finished his sermon when, without an invitation, the
   congregation arose and many flocked to the altar, screaming for mercy.
   When all the space around and within the altar was crowded with
   seekers, the preacher in charge asked all in the house who desired to
   become Christians to arise, when it was thought that five hundred more
   arose for prayers. The number afterward converted justified that
   estimate. For many years that night was commonly referred to as "the
   great night."

   About a month after this an old Class Leader asked Mr. Redfield if he
   remembered making the statement on "the great night" that the probation
   of one soul would end that night. On being answered in the affirmative,
   he went on to say that a lady converted that night, and who afterwards
   joined his class, had told him that six weeks previous she dreamed
   three times during one night that in just six weeks her probation would
   end. That night the six weeks were ended and she was happily converted.

   Though this incident is given by Mr. Redfield himself in this
   connection, it is not designed to teach that probation ends with
   conversion. He was the furtherest from teaching any such doctrine, as
   his experience herein would show. The account is related because of the
   remarkable coincidence in the events described.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 13

   The great awakening with which the last chapter concluded continued
   without interruption for fourteen months.

   Mr. Redfield was invited to preach in different churches in New York.
   His health rapidly improved, and he conscientiously used it for God's
   glory. Many remarkable incidents occurred during these labors. Great
   manifestations of divine power often attended his ministry. Persons
   under conviction would sometimes fly from the house to avoid yielding
   to Christ, and afterwards be found lying upon the walks, helpless. At
   first, the policemen would take them to the station house, and lay them
   side and side upon the floor, and watch them until they "came to." The
   first night this occurred it created no little excitement. Quite a
   number had thus been gathered in, and a large crowd stood around the
   door wondering what it meant. While they were gazing and commenting,
   and endeavoring to account for the strange phenomena, the head of one
   of the prostrate ones raised, and a shout of "Glory to God!" came from
   his lips. Then, another, and another, and another, did likewise, until
   all of them were at it at once. The station was made to resound with
   unaccustomed noise the praises of God instead of cursing and blasphemy.
   When it was discovered that such persons were neither harmed nor
   harmful, the officers ceased to take them to the station, but watched
   them where they fell, until they "came to" and were able to care for
   themselves.

   Singularly, this timid, shrinking man, who dreaded the responsibilities
   of the Christian ministry so much, was providentially thrown into the
   great metropolis of the nation to commence his work; where the people,
   gathered in such masses, made the responsibility so much the greater.

   In the midst of this great victory, Mr. Redfield was not without
   temptation. His clear perceptions of what was meet and right, sharpened
   by his struggles with unbelief, the rough handlings of providence, and
   the rougher handling of his fellowmen, made him feel intensely his
   weakness and his dependence upon God. Above all, the constant dread of
   his wife making an evil use of the facts of his family life, and of
   evil-disposed persons making a worse use of what they did not
   understand, kept him in the dust at the foot of the cross. Now and then
   he seems to have had a glimpse of the benefit God was making these
   things to him, but generally this fact was hid from his mind. His
   greatest fear was concerning the harm they might work to the cause of
   Christ. He resolved to say nothing about his matters, except when
   asked, and then to be perfectly frank with all who sought for
   information. But he soon learned that a story once out was likely to
   grow into untruthful details. At last he came to the conclusion that
   this was to be his "thorn," and his best way was to bear it in silence
   and alone.

   He now instinctively turned toward the mercy-seat, and asked for
   greater grace to meet his great responsibilities. To fit himself
   especially for the work before him, he once more began to seek the
   experience of holiness. The next chapter relates this experience in his
   own words.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 14

   Mr. Redfield relates his experience in the matter of seeking holiness
   as follows:

   "I now began to see and feel my need of entire sanctification. I had
   perverted views of what constituted that state of grace, and of the way
   to seek it, but I resolved to set about seeking it as best I knew. I
   inquired of a number of persons who professed to know something of the
   experience, what I must do to obtain it. Their instructions did not
   help me in the least; and all I had done to this time furnished me with
   no evidence that I had made any appreciable advance toward it. My
   resolve now was to make a business of seeking it, and to be desperate
   in the effort. Long before this I had earnestly sought for it, by
   fasting and prayer, and watchnights, until I was utterly exhausted by
   the effort. In all this I had failed to see the grand end to be
   secured, which is nothing more or less than perfect submission to, and
   harmony with, the will of God. I had yet to learn that the great
   preparation to receive it was to get the consent and choice of my will
   that God's will should be done, and whatever else I might do a
   deficiency in this would defeat my effort.

   "I had now fairly entered the gospel field. My long neglected and much
   dreaded duty I had now made my life work. I began with singleness of
   purpose to seek this precious pearl. Yet, fearful that one so utterly
   unworthy might be denied so great a boon, I longed to lay my heart open
   to some one who could instruct me; not knowing that this state can no
   more be comprehended before its attainment, than justification can be
   by an infidel. At last I heard that a good old gentleman who had
   enjoyed this blessing for more than forty years was coming to make his
   annual visit to his children with whom I was then boarding. In due time
   he came, and I took him to my room one day, closed the door, and with a
   sense of my own unworthiness, I asked him if God was willing that such
   an unworthy person as myself should possess so great a blessing as
   perfect love. The enemy was all this time suggesting to me that he
   probably would say, No! You are too young and presumptuous to think of
   that great and exalted state yet. But no, with deep and tender emotions
   the good old father answered, "Why, bless your dear heart; why, yes,
   the Lord wants you to be holy." And I felt such gratitude towards the
   old man, because he thought God was willing to indulge me with the gift
   of so great a grace, as I never can describe. From this I took fresh
   courage. I now asked him, "Can you tell me how I can get possession of
   it?' To this he replied, "By faith." But he might as well have answered
   in Hebrew, for I understood not his meaning. I dreaded deception, and I
   could not suppose it possible that a state of grace that I had set so
   high an estimate upon could be secured short of a correspondingly
   valuable price or gift, instead of a single cheap and worthless act of
   believing. [So faith appeared to him then. Editor] If he had told me to
   do some great thing, or to be very faithful, and expect to grow up into
   it by a long and tedious process; I could have thought his instruction
   more rational. I remembered the soul-tearing process which I witnessed
   in a br other who was seeking the blessing at the camp meeting where I
   was converted, and I thought that must be the true way. I had serious
   doubts, however, about my constitution being able to endure the agony
   necessary to obtain the blessing.

   "While conversing with a person upon the subject one day, an elderly
   brother standing near, asked, "Why don't you go across the town to
   R_____ street, where they have meetings every week at Dr. Palmer's?
   They can tell you how to find the blessing."

   "Another elderly brother who stood by, and in whose piety I had great
   confidence, but who, though he believed in that stat of grace and had
   been seeking it for about twenty-six years without success, now said to
   me aside, "You must be very careful about having anything to do with
   Dr. Palmer's people, for they will tell you to believe that you already
   have the blessing, and besides many people do not think them so pious
   as thy pretend to be, after all their sanctimonious airs, uniform dress
   and great pretensions."

   From that moment I so greatly feared them that I would have received
   instruction from them no sooner than from a Mahometan. Indeed, I think
   I would have avoided them at all hazard if about to meet them on the
   street. I now remembered hearing Dr. Fisk answer the questions of my
   mother, as to what and how she should believe, "Believe," said he,
   "that you have it, and you have it." I did not then see the difference
   between "believing that you are receiving it, and that will bring it,"
   and "believing that you have received it, and that will make it a fact
   that you have received it!" Both, alike, were utterly opposed to my
   reason; and I could have as easily endorsed Mahometanism as holiness
   secured by these irrational means. I now began to think I could see
   through the vagaries of these people; that their holiness consisted in
   giving up all concern about the matter, and then by imagining that the
   end was gained, the cessation from the struggle would leave them quiet,
   and this quiet they called the witness of holiness.

   "Of course I had abandoned all hope of attaining the blessing in the
   way I had pursued so long and so unsuccessfully. And now I went to work
   with all determination, hoping if my body could endure the agony
   through which I expected to pass, I might by this desperation gain the
   land of Beulah. Hearing there was to be a campmeeting within the bounds
   of an adjoining conference I determined to go, as a stranger, and thus
   avoid being seen by any of the brethren of the society where I
   belonged. I knew they had confidence in my piety, but I was afraid
   should they see me in great agony seeking the blessing of holiness,
   they might not know what to think of it; and possibly they might
   conclude that I had been committing some grievous sin; and not being
   able to explain all to their satisfaction, they would feel grieved, and
   I thereby would be the occasion of great injury to the cause of Christ.

   "When I reached the campground I found there a number of the brethren I
   desired to avoid. Well, thought I, it is my duty and privilege to be
   holy, to fit me for the great work I have to do; so I shall attend to
   that and leave God to take care of the results. I was called upon to
   preach, but as I had come to seek the blessing of holiness, and to make
   that my business, I declined. When I began in earnest to rein myself up
   to the work, the devil became in earnest also, and induced me to begin
   to inspect the external evidences of other people's piety. It seemed to
   me that I never saw the corrupt state of the church as I saw it then.
   One person's mode of dress was trim, and that to me was evidence of
   pride; another's was careless, and that indicated pride of his fancied
   humility. I felt grieved at these evidences of spiritual decline, and
   my tears flowed in abundance.

   "While walking in the grove alone, and grieving thus I met the good old
   man who had given me such comfort in saying he thought God was willing
   that I should have the blessing of holiness; and I began telling him
   how I had come to the meeting to seek it, but that such evidences of
   decline in the church made me feel so badly that I could not attend to
   it with any hope of success. The old gentleman saw this to be a trick
   of the devil to divert my attention and efforts from the great work,
   and with a few words he set me right.

   "I," said he, "was once troubled as you are now, and I got out of it by
   resolving, if everybody else goes to hell, by the grace of God I am
   going to heaven."

   "This broke the spell of what I then saw was on of the devil's pious
   frauds, to hinder me from gaining the precious prize I was after.

   "I now thought, if ever I gain the blessing, I must call my New York
   brethren into a tent to pray for me, and thus risk every evil coming
   through their possible misapprehensions of my moral state. This I did,
   and when I had stated my object and purpose, I asked them to pray for
   me. I had an idea that they would pray for me with all their might, and
   possibly create a wave, so to speak, on which my little bark could come
   to land. They began to pray at random, for everybody, and everything,
   without touching my case, just as people generally pray when they don't
   expect any thing. I was now compelled to learn that no delegated power
   could reach my case, and I must go to God for myself. I then, while
   still on my knees, concluded to do my own praying and struggling; and
   supposing that the successful mode of prayer must be that which is
   characterized by great vehemence and will power, I watched my
   opportunity to break out in vociferous tones, and then I tried it; but
   I could not have uttered a loud word if it would have saved me, for my
   lips seemed to be sealed. This taught me the meaning of the words, "Not
   by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord."

   "I then turned to look into my heart to see what progress I was making,
   and was overwhelmed to find nothing but what caused loathing and
   abhorrence. It seemed to me that I had lost all my religion in trying
   to get more. The enemy now suggested, "You have lost all in trying to
   get holiness; you might better give up the struggle if such is to be
   the success of your effort," and believing this to be a fact, I arose
   and left the tent to mourn over my last and greatest calamity. As I was
   passing along I met the good old man again, and while telling him what
   a disaster I had met with in trying to get holiness, I asked, "Don't
   you think I have done wrong in aspiring after such an exalted state of
   grace? I know I have lost all I had, for I certainly had the witness of
   the Spirit when I left New York, but now it is gone."

   "Why, bless your dear heart," said this good man, "don't you know the
   Lord is just emptying you?' Then, in a few words he set me right again.
   I had supposed holiness to be given in installments, and when a
   Succession of blessings combined had filled my heart about so full, I
   might call it holiness; first, the pardon of sins, then the joys of
   salvation, and then a succession of indefinite blessings, which in the
   aggregate would make up the sum total of holiness. Now I learned that
   every blessing I ever had must be emptied out, for God would not till a
   vessel with the wine of Canaan while it was half full of manna. I had
   now passed the days for relishing manna, and my Father had enough of
   the old corn and wine and this hereafter was to be my food. I had been
   seeking the last installment to complete the blessing.

   "I now asked him, "What shall I do?

   "Said he, "You must believe for the blessing."

   "I went out into the grove alone, and while waiting upon the Lord and
   trying to believe, I thought I saw Jesus with my inner eye, just as I
   saw him at the time of my conversion. It was the appearance of Jesus as
   crucified. A voice seemed to say to me, "All you can do now is to
   believe in this crucified man, Jesus' (for the time his divinity was
   hidden from me). But the idea of trusting my soul's salvation on a dead
   man, aroused all my old infidel notions: and I dared not risk it. That
   image appeared as distinctly as that of a person to my outward eye. He
   seemed to be in the twilight, and but a few rods distant from me. The
   camp meeting came to a close, and I went away without the great
   blessing.

   "So away I went to another camp meeting which was to be held the next
   week. There again I stirred up myself to a desperate effort to seek for
   holiness, but with no appreciable advance! One day some one told me
   that the Palmers from New York were on the ground, and had a tent for
   the promotion of holiness. This family I feared more than the enemy of
   all righteousness; but as my success in seeking holiness was so poor, I
   finally thought I would find that tent and take a seat in some corner
   where if I saw they were pressing error upon the people I could quietly
   leave them. Strange as it may seem, an impression beset me that they
   might, without, or against my reason, or consent, fasten error upon me;
   so I resolved to be on the alert, and if I saw it coming to avoid it by
   flight. I reached the tent and took my seat as I had determined. I saw
   here a large number of persons, and among them some Presbyterians, and
   some of other denominations. They were all sitting very composedly
   while one was reading from the Bible. I thought, "Can this be the way
   to seek holiness? I wonder that they don't get down and pray with all
   their might!" Still I could not complain of their reading the Bible,
   for that must be right. After the reading a lady arose whom I guessed
   to be the one from New York, whom I most feared, and I thought, I must
   now be on my guard; but the first words she uttered were, "I beseech
   you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your
   bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable, unto God, which is your
   reasonable service." A living sacrifice," she said, "is a perpetual
   sacrifice." Well, thought I, that is Bible, and all right, so far. She
   then went on to state the preliminary steps to be taken: "First, a
   thorough consecration of ourselves to God. "Very well," said I to
   myself, "all this I have done, over and over again." She then made this
   entire consecration to appear as a reasonable demand. She also showed
   the reasonableness of believing that God meant what he said, and that
   he would do w hat he said he would do, and that our faith must rest
   mainly on his promise. "He has said if I will do thus and so, he will
   meet me there and then, and faith consists in taking him at his word."

   "I then saw the way of faith as never before, and I said to myself, "I
   have tried everything else but faith; I will now go out and make an
   experiment." So I went out back of the encampment and stood reviewing
   my consecration to be certain that all was thoroughly devoted to God in
   an everlasting covenant. In a moment there appeared to me that image of
   Christ crucified; but I saw only his humanity. I seemed to be standing
   upon the edge of a fathomless gulf, and Christ stood upon the opposite
   side. The distance seemed too far for me to leap it, yet it was the
   thing for me to do. I must trust that crucified Christ to save me from
   ruin. It seemed to me that if I should make the effort and it prove a
   failure, I must from that moment bid adieu to all hopes of the world of
   blessedness, and abandon the profession of religion forever. I saw that
   everything I hoped, feared and desired was now, with all that I
   expected in the world to come, all, all to be staked on a single act,
   to be lost or won forever. I was intensely aroused by the thought of
   hazarding every hope of heaven like that, and I offered this prayer, "O
   Lord, thou knowest all hearts, and that I want to do thy will. I have
   tried honestly to know all, and to do all I could to get right, and
   thou knowest that I stand ready to do or to suffer anything imposed
   upon me by which to secure the great blessing of perfect love. I have
   tried everything but this single and apparently inefficient and
   hopeless act of faith, which looks to my reason more like presumption
   than like an act that can do me good; and now, O God, seeing no other
   untried way, I will make the venture, and if it fails, on thee must
   rest the responsibility. If I am lost for believing in Christ, I cannot
   help it."

   "I seemed now to open converse with the Holy Ghost, and asked, "How
   shall I believe? with my head or with my heart?"

   "The answer came, "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and
   with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

   "I now made the leap, as distinctly as if it had been in body, and in
   the same moment found myself in the arms of Jesus, who held me safely.
   I felt that I could risk a world in his hands; for I saw that "in him
   dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."

   "Oh, how changed did all things seem in that glorious moment! "
   Surely," said I, this must be heaven, or like it, for it comes up to my
   highest ideal of that place."

   "The next moment the enemy suggested, "This is not the blessing of
   holiness, for you did not lose your strength, nor have you shouted, or
   made any great ado about it; but on the other hand you do not want to
   speak aloud." And it did seem as though a single loud word would mar
   the rich spell which held me captive.

   "I then took my eye of faith off from the Saviour, to examine this
   temptation, and in a moment I was back on the other side of the gulf
   again, and was as empty as ever. "Well," said I, to myself, "I felt all
   right while believing." That emboldened me to try again, and with
   greater daring than before, and with the same happy result.

   "Now the temptation, "You cannot keep it," took my eye off again, and
   again I was back on the other side of the gulf. I then sprang off
   again, when the tempter said, "No one will believe you," and again
   succeeded in robbing me of my witness.

   "And so did I alternate between faith and doubt, joy and sorrow, until
   I learned this fact, that it is not for believing, but while believing
   that the work is done. I hang upon the atonement, and realize the
   response of the Holy Spirit assuring me that the work is done. So I now
   determined to make the leap again, and to keep my eye on Christ. This I
   did; but the enemy asked, "How will it be tomorrow?"

   "I answered, "I don't know, for tomorrow has not yet come.

   "Well, how will it be in five minutes?"

   "I answered, "I don't know nor will I concern myself about it; I
   believe I am saved now." I now saw the philosophy of faith. I breathe
   but one breath of air at a time; that is all I need; when I want
   another, it will be allowed. So I do not need a stock of the joys of
   salvation for future use, but take it, breathe it, by acts of faith
   just as I have need. Continuously acting faith brings a continuous
   supply. Faith to the soul is what breathing is to the body.

   "Now, too, I learned the philosophy of consecration. It is to make room
   by emptying out the heart.

   "Now," said the Holy Spirit, "go and tell brother M_____ what the Lord
   has done for you."

   "I went onto the campground and when I found him, I began: "Brother
   M_____, I believe"--

   "If you tell him," said the tempter, "he'll tell you to be very careful
   about making great professions, for sanctification is a very great
   blessing."

   "Brother M stood gazing at me without saying a word.

   "Then I began again, "Brother M_____, I believe," but fearing he would
   think I was boasting, I began to qualify my statement, but did not
   speak, and finally broke out, "if I don't keep it five minutes, I
   believe that Jesus has sanctified my unworthy heart. Glory to God!"

   "Said Brother M_____, "Go and tell my wife."

   "I had now gathered strength by the testimony I had given, and the
   confidence Brother M_____ seemed to express; and away I went to his
   wife, and said to her, "Sister M_____ Jesus has given me the great
   blessing."

   "She rejoiced, and said, "Now go up on the stand and profess it to all
   the people."

   "I did so, and it seemed to settle and establish me.

   "From this I learned to confess the exact thing done for me, and to
   guard against even hesitation in professing the thing as it is.

   "Dr. Palmer found me, and said, "Mr. Wesley says that one
   sanctification is equal to ten conversions, as it will result in that."

   "I took a cue for my future labors from this, and resolved to make a
   test of it now. I went into a tent and began at once to invite my
   brethren to come now to the cleansing blood. We started a meeting, and
   God began at once to work in awful power. I have always found that
   making the experience of holiness the principal feature in revival
   meetings does not hinder the work of conversions. Here one or two
   penitents came in unasked, and one said, "I was impressed to come to
   this very tent." In a few minutes they were converted. The work in this
   manner increased until the end of the camp meeting.

   "Now I began to learn a distinction between the joys of sanctification
   and those of justification. Formerly, if a camp meeting had been a good
   one, I would feel sad to leave the hallowed spot. The striking of the
   tents was to me like a funeral. Now I found it a matter of joy, for I
   carried a camp meeting with me. In holiness I found all the elements of
   a good meeting. When I reached my room in the city, the thought came,
   "You will sleep off all this as you have other blessings." I retired to
   rest, and the last words from my lips were, "Glory to God!" When I
   awoke in the morning, it was "Glory to God!" still. Thus I found the
   old corn and wine of the Canaan of perfect love was unlike the manna of
   justification, it was hearty, solid and abiding. Sabbath came, and I
   found no more shrinking from doing duty. I went over to the church, and
   in offering the closing prayer I had special liberty, and was sweetly
   blessed.

   "On passing down the aisle a good brother met me and said, "Do you know
   how you prayed? Why you prayed directly to Christ, and you did not even
   mention the name of God, but seemed to pray as if you could get
   anything you asked of Jesus."

   "Well, brother, it did seem to me that "in him dwelt all the fullness
   of the Godhead bodily." And don't you know that Jesus said once,
   "Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name. Ask and receive that your
   joy may be full."

   "I now felt the power of the words, "No man can call Jesus Lord, but by
   the Holy Ghost," as never before. It seemed no risk to hang a world's
   salvation on the merits of Christ. In this light I saw the sin of
   unbelief to be the great soul-destroying sin of the world, and in
   comparison with it murder, robbery, and other sins were of small
   account."

CHAPTER 15

   Mr. Redfield's pastor was a good man, but he did not enjoy the
   experience of entire sanctification. Like a true man, he stood by this
   doctrine of the church. He said, that some years before, while he was
   earnestly seeking it, the blessing began to come upon him in great
   power, and he was tempted to believe that it would take his life, and
   he refused it. From that time he had thought that he must pass through
   life without it as a punishment. Strange as it may seem, many
   intelligent and sound theologians are troubled with just such
   difficulties. While this man could not enter into the work with the
   zest which otherwise might have characterized him, he encouraged others
   in the work.

   With a full heart and strong purpose Mr. Redfield set about inviting
   his brethren and sisters to claim their privilege of enjoying this
   great blessing. He was a Class Leader, and besides attending his own,
   he visited other classes; attended all the prayer meetings, and
   preached often. He appointed one meeting each week for the promotion of
   holiness and in it God wrought in great power. Holiness became the
   theme all through the society, and in the neighborhood; and in a very
   short time there were more than one hundred who could testify in
   love-feast that they were fully saved. These all became workers for
   God, in season and out of season, for the conversion of sinners. The
   latter now began to fill the meetings, and soon to seek the Lord, and
   sanctifications rapidly followed justifications, and the laborers
   increased in the same proportion, and so the work went on.

   One sister who kept a school did her own housework, took care of her
   children, and prepared all the meals for her husband, yet found time to
   bring from six to twelve sinners to Jesus every week. The work of
   conversions at last broke out with great power, and extended rapidly,
   until the membership ran up from five hundred to nine hundred, and the
   society had to be divided, and then again the second time, and
   furnished a large number for a third church. A heavy church debt was
   also rapidly decreasing by the freewill offerings of the people.
   Visitors from other churches, and from the country, some from sixty
   miles away, came to gain a knowledge of full salvation, and then
   returned to spread the holy fire. Speaking of these times, Mr. Redfield
   says:

   "I wish the truth did not require the statement of some facts that show
   that the work at that date met with hindrances. Justice to the cause of
   holiness requires me to do it, that the honest hearted may know that
   the slow progress, and almost final extinction of this blessed
   doctrine, was by no means due to any inherent weakness in itself. It
   began to wane under the combined hostility of a few who would not pay
   the price of getting right with God. Some of them had dances in their
   houses; some said, "We want no more revivals in our church, for it
   dirties up the house, and if sinners desire to get religion let them go
   somewhere else, we have enough members now for one church." Others
   cried out for order, and neatness, and taste, lest their children go
   off to other and more fashionable churches. So they had the church
   newly and fancifully painted on the inside, introduced instrumental
   music for the choir; then sold the seats. Then God quit them, the
   congregations ran down, church debts ran up, and the last end was worse
   than the first. And then the complaint was heard, that "Redfield had
   done more hurt than good." Some who had professed to believe in
   holiness began a determined warfare against it. They would go to some
   who professed to have experienced the blessing, and begin thus: "You
   say you are sanctified, do you?

   "In great modesty they would reply, "I do believe Jesus has wrought
   that great work in my heart."

   "Then these opposers would say, "You must be very careful how you
   profess anything like that, for some people simply get excited and call
   that sanctification. I have been praying for it a good many years, and
   I have not got it yet; nor do I know how long before I shall get it.
   Besides, we think you who have been converted only a short time, do not
   treat us old people with due consideration, even if you do enjoy the
   experience when you step in before us and profess it."

   "I asked one who made this complaint to me, "How long have you been
   seeking the experience?'

   "Twenty-six years," he answered.

   "How much nearer are you to it now than twenty-six years ago?'

   "He hesitated, and finally answered, "I cannot say that I am any nearer
   to it."

   "Well, at this rate, how much longer will it take you to get it?'

   "This stopped his caviling with me, but not his hostility to the work.

   "Such arguments against the possibility of young converts entering into
   the experience so early, caused many of them to give up the doctrine
   and the testimony, and then they lost the witness of it. Then these
   opposers would approach them, and ask, "Do you think you have
   sanctification now?' The answer would be honestly given, "I am not
   clear, I may be mistaken." Then the opposer, in triumph would say, "If
   you had really received it you would not have lost it so easily."

   "I was, of course, deeply grieved and hardly knew what to do. I had
   felt so sure that I had found the secret of how to convert the world,
   and believed that Methodists and Methodist preachers needed only to see
   the practical workings of their own doctrine, and they would at once
   return to it in preaching and practice, and their methods and polity
   would enable them to take the world. I believed, though, that this
   manifestation of opposition was exceptional and that this doctrine of
   the Wesleys, Fletcher, Bramwell, Abbott and Fisk would yet succeed. I
   determined not to abate one jot, but to keep on preaching and pressing
   the doctrine which I knew from the experiment so far, would work wonder
   in saving sinners. I felt to say, "I know this to be right, and if
   everybody fights it, it is of God, and I'll stand by it, if I stand
   alone."

   "I now felt my commission to the world was renewed and extended, and I
   determined that, regardless of difficulties, "I will go as far as I can
   and stop only when I must; if I never get through I will try, and if I
   die, I will die trying, and at my post; and like the old Syracusan,
   when he had discovered the power of the lever, I'll cry, "Eureka!
   Eureka!" I have found it, I have found it. For if some oppose, some
   will embrace the blessed doctrine, and the results will give them
   confidence, and Methodism will fulfill its mission in the world.
   Whether I am countenanced by men or not, I do know, bless the Lord,
   that Jesus approves of me, in my purposes and course; and whatever
   becomes of me, the world shall have it to say, that there is one man
   who will either prove true to God or die trying. If some will pull down
   the work of God, I must work the harder and faster to build it up.

   "I was soon to be put to the test. Not long after this a brother came
   to me one day and said, "You must not go to your class tonight, you
   must attend the official meeting, for there is trouble about to come on
   you. You must not be surprised if your class-book is taken from you,
   and if your meetings for holiness are stopped."

   "What is the matter?" I asked.

   "Some of the official board dislike your talking about holiness very
   much, and they say you have already done more harm than you can do
   good."

   "But, with this wonderful work of God before me, I failed to see the
   evil they claimed I was doing, and believing that God bade me go on, I
   said to him, "I can't go to the official meeting, for God wants me to
   go to the class meeting.

   "Another and another came to me with the same message, and one of them
   said, "If you don't go, I shall." I told them all, "God calls me to my
   class, and he will defend his own cause. If not, I don't want to
   contend for anything he will not stand by."

   "The preacher then came and advised me to go, but I answered, "With all
   deference to you as my pastor, I must decline, for I feel I must go to
   any class and leave consequences with God."

   "When I went into the classroom I found it filled as full as it could
   be, while the passage way was full out to the street. In opening the
   meeting by prayer, I said, "O Lord, if we are engaged in a work that
   pleases thee; if this is thy cause, give us a token in such a blessing
   as we have not known." Instantly fifteen or twenty were struck down by
   the power of God, myself among the number.

   "The commotion was as great outside the classroom as inside. As soon as
   I could speak, I said, "Go on! for you have a greater leader than man
   tonight." Immediately one sister who had recovered her strength arose
   and said, "I have been powerfully tempted this day, from hearing that
   there was going to be an attempt made to stop these meetings, and to
   take Brother Redfield's class-book from him, and I have been praying
   about it all day, and just before night I got the witness that God
   would not allow it to be done."

   "Then arose another, and another, and still another, until some twelve
   or fourteen had testified in like manner as to their temptations, their
   prayers and the answer to their prayers, in regard to the matter. Of
   course they could not know beforehand what the action of the official
   board would be. The meeting closed and the next day I heard from the
   board as follows "A motion was made to arrest the holiness work and put
   a stop to the meetings; but the preacher in charge interposed by
   saying, "While I am in the chair, I shall exercise my prerogatives, by
   not putting any such motion to vote. If you pass them without me, I
   shall act upon my authority, and tell yon that you cannot interfere
   with those meetings, or abridge Brother Redfield's liberties."'

   "All at once one or two of the strongest opposers to the work arose and
   confessed that they felt their opposition to be wrong, and that they
   were contending against God. For awhile the opposition ceased and the
   glorious work went on.

   "One evening I shall never forget. We were in the main audience-room. I
   had been urging the membership to seek holiness, as the best means of
   promoting a revival, and that sinners would be convicted while the
   church was seeking holiness. They came around the altar, filled it, and
   then the large aisles, nearly to the doors. I saw a door open and in
   came a man, who pushed his way through the mass kneeling in the
   passage, until he reached the altar, and then extending his hand to
   mine, said, "As I was passing the church a moment ago, and knew not
   what was going on here, I was suddenly impressed to come in; for what I
   could not tell; but now I know; and I ask, "Is there salvation for me?"
   He then knelt among the seekers."

   Soon after a delegation from another church waited upon Mr. Redfield
   and invited him to come and labor with them, saying, "We believe if you
   will come we will have a revival." Said he, "Brethren, if you desire a
   revival, let your church seek holiness, and God will work among sinners
   at the same time." He finally went and preached as well as he could to
   the church and to sinners, but without any results. He then, one
   evening, appealed to the church again, and urged them to seek holiness;
   and after stating the cost and condition connected with it, invited the
   membership to the altar; at the same time barely saying to the
   unconverted, "If you, desire religion you may come too;" when eleven
   immediately came. He went home and in a week or ten days he was sent
   for again. The committee said, "You must come again, for the revival
   has come to a stop."

   He asked, "But were not the eleven converted?"

   "Oh, yes, they answered "and then it all went down."

   "But, have any of the church members experienced holiness?" he asked.

   "Oh, no, we were so rejoiced to see sinners get religion, that we
   forgot all about that."

   "I thought so," was his reply.

   He was persuaded to go again, but he had no success. At last he said to
   the church, "You know, brethren, what God did when I was here before.
   Now try it over again, and hold on until God saves you. They came
   forward again, and nine sinners followed them to the altar; and the
   meeting went on for some time with great success.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 16

   The annual conference came on, and there was a change of pastors. The
   new pastor was a younger man than his predecessor. He was evidently
   ambitious, and tried hard to please the party opposed to holiness, as
   that was the predominant party in the church. When his first year was
   drawing to a close, and the time for the last quarterly conference was
   at hand, Mr. Redfield was laboring some eight miles up the river above
   the city. A revival of glorious power was in progress, and it seemed to
   be his duty to stay with it. He called on his pastor one day and asked
   him to look after the passing of his character, and the renewing of his
   license. His pastor assured him that this would be done. He went back
   to his work, and soon after learned that his pastor took advantage of
   his absence, to bring in a complaint of heresy against him, and the
   question of the renewal of his license was laid over. But the presiding
   elder sent word to him to go on, and he would sustain him. He labored
   on until the next quarterly conference, and when the time came was
   greatly tempted to let this obstruction settle the question as to his
   continuing in the work; and let those who opposed bear the
   responsibility. Then came again the message, "Live while you preach,
   but no longer." Both sides of the case were vividly presented to his
   mind, the fearful consequences of not going forward, and the
   blessedness of heaven's approval should he diligently pursue the path
   of duty. Yet he suffered much over the thought that those who should
   have made the way smooth for him, were hedging it up. He could but say,
   "If they knew how much of suffering it costs me to follow this path,
   and would ask themselves what motive must it be that governs him, they
   would not do so."

   With great reluctance he attended the quarterly conference. There was a
   full attendance of its membership, numbering forty-five or fifty. At
   the appropriate time he was called upon to answer to the charge of
   heresy. It consisted of two points; first, his views of the nature of
   the millennium; and second, his views of the doctrine of Christian
   perfection. He arose, and invited all to correct him, if he did not
   tell the truth, and to prompt him, if he did not tell all the truth.
   When he had finished his statement of his views, respecting the first,
   the presiding elder said, "Brethren, we must accept of his views, for
   he is with Dr. Clarke. He now asked for the same thoroughness on the
   second complaint. He told them his experience, as much of it as had a
   bearing on the doctrine of specific holiness, of his teaching,
   preaching and belief. When he had finished, the elder again interposed,
   and said, "Brethren, we must accept of that, for he is exactly with Mr.
   Wesley."

   The call was then made for a vote on the renewal of his license, which
   was granted by a vote of forty to five.

   He then told the conference he had a little business for them to do. He
   said, "During the past three months, the report has been kept in
   circulation that my own church would not renew my license, and the
   public know not the cause; and even some preachers to whose charges I
   have been invited, have had to search for these facts to satisfy their
   official boards, before they would consent to allow me to labor among
   them. I now desire you to give me a certificate stating that I have
   been examined on the points of doctrine for which my license was
   suspended, and that I have been exonerated from the charge of heresy,
   and found to be a sound Methodist."

   At this his pastor arose and said, he could not vote Mr. Redfield a
   sound Methodist, because, said he, "We as a church do not believe with
   either Clarke or Wesley on these points, but with Benson."

   One of the official board who was grieved that Mr. Redfield was let off
   so easily, arose and said, "If any man says there is anything in the
   doctrine of sanctification, he's a liar."

   The presiding elder exclaimed, "Stop! stop! Brother Redfield is a
   Methodist and you are not. I did not know that this church would
   tolerate such anti-Methodistic doctrines as this."

   The motion was finally modified to suit the preacher in charge, and
   read, "That the quarterly conference having examined Brother Redfield,
   found nothing against him."

   Of these proceedings Mr. Redfield says, "Oh, how my heart was pained,
   not only to see this unsoundness as to the truth, but such quibbling
   and dodging when it came to the issue. I also saw that among the
   preachers there was an element that was not Methodistic. Still, my
   confidence in the ultimate success of the doctrine of holiness was
   unshaken."

   He soon learned that this hostility was not against himself, but
   against the cause which he represented. He also learned, as many have
   since, that he who declares himself on the side of God, has virtually
   declared war against earth, hell, dead formality, and ambitious
   ministers of the gospel.

   Mr. Redfield says: "A friend of mine, an uncompromising champion for
   God and the truth, was so much feared, that the preachers in his
   conference sought his ruin. Like the accusers of Daniel, they were
   compelled to find the occasion in his religion. They appointed a
   preacher's meeting where each was expected to give a specimen of his
   abilities by reading a sermon or essay, which should then be criticized
   by the rest. They assigned to this brother a sermon on holiness.
   Waiving his scruples against written sermons, he did as he was bidden.
   When the time came the sermon was read, and then the criticisms
   commenced. Said one of the preachers, "I have often heard that this
   brother was antiWesleyan on the doctrine of holiness, and now we have
   heard it from his own lips." He then followed this with a criticism so
   severe that some began to sympathize with the author of the sermon. And
   they said to him when the first critic was through, "You have a right
   to defend yourself. "Never mind," said the brother, "go on and say all
   you wish to." Then another took the sermon to pieces and showed its
   heretical character. Then another, and still another. Finally the
   presiding elder was called upon to make some remarks, but he only said,
   "The anti-Wesleyan character of the sermon is such that I shall have to
   reprove the brother first, privately, according to the Discipline;"
   intimating by this that he would bring charges against him at the
   conference.

   "Well, are you all through?' inquired the brother; and on being
   answered in the affirmative, he said, "Now, all I have to say is, I
   have copied every word of that sermon from John Wesley's, and in my
   manuscript you will find I have given the volume and the page from
   which it is taken. And I ask, Who is Wesleyan, you or I?'

   This was an unexpected turn, and some began to excuse themselves by
   saying they had not refreshed their memories of late by reading Mr.
   Wesley's writings on the subject. Another attempted to parry the stroke
   by complaining of unfairness in the preacher's taking out isolated
   portions of Mr. Wesley' writings and reading them as if they were his
   own productions.

   This circumstance, when it came to Mr. Redfield's knowledge, convinced
   him more strongly that the opposition was not personal, but against the
   cause of holiness itself. At the same time he was impressed that he
   would be made to feel this hostility more keenly still, and perhaps
   would be forced to quit the field. But he resolved to go to the last
   link of the chain, for God and purity, and stop only when he could go
   no farther.

   With a clearer understanding of what it meant, he now more fully than
   ever committed himself to the work of spreading scriptural holiness
   over the land. While aware of the deep-seated opposition to holiness
   now beginning to be manifest, he had the hope that great success, in
   the conversion of sinners, would demonstrate to the preachers that God
   endorsed the doctrine, and at last their opposition would give way. He
   saw, too, that the literature of Methodism and the Discipline were in
   its favor, and he looked to see those who stood out against the
   doctrine brought to account for their criticisms and opposition.

   About this time, also, Rev. L. L. Hamline was elevated to the
   episcopacy in the church, a man whose experience and preaching, and
   holy life, made him one of the brightest examples and witnesses of the
   doctrine in the annals of the church. For many years after this he was
   the confidential adviser of Mr. Redfield, and, to a great extent,
   guided his labors, as to place and time.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 17

   Mr. Redfield was now invited to join the traveling connection of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church. For a season he looked upon this with
   favor.

   While considering this matter he became convinced that from some cause
   many of the conference preachers had lost their experiences, and most
   of them their freedom. He searched for the causes of this. He found
   that most of these desired to be and to do right, but that they were
   timid. Some of them acknowledged that they were afraid of proscription
   in case they should make a specialty of the doctrine and experience of
   holiness. In view of this, and of the fact that he felt more especially
   called to the work of an evangelist, he concluded that his place was in
   the local ranks. Here he would be more free to go where the way opened
   before him.

   At this time there were but few evangelists in the field. It was the
   beginning of a new era of evangelistic effort. James Caughey had just
   commenced his great work, and was going like a flame of fire over
   England and Ireland.

   John Newland Maffit, one of the most eloquent preachers of this
   century, had been laboring as an evangelist throughout the country with
   marked success; but the eclipse of his brilliant career, which by many
   was believed to be the result of his own indiscretion, now produced a
   public sentiment in regard to evangelistic work which was embarrassing
   and unfavorable to others who would enter upon it. Finney and Burchard
   of the Presbyterian Church, and Knapp among the Baptists, were the
   leading men, if not the only ones in this particular department of
   church work, except Mr. Redfield, who represented the Methodist
   Episcopal Church.

   We have seen the terrific struggles through which he passed before he
   would consent to enter the sacred office. Now we see him about to enter
   its most untried and difficult phase of work. His first thought was to
   go where there were no organized churches, and so become a pioneer to
   other local preachers in such fields. But the trusting, "Man proposes,
   but God disposes," has been made a truism by such experiences as we are
   now contemplating.

   At this very time he had been invited to go up the river about twenty
   miles above New York city, and add his efforts to the labors of other
   local preachers who had broken the ground and, as he says, "begun to
   see some hopes of good." He found that formerly the people here had
   heard but two sermons a year, and those on weekday afternoons, and by a
   rank Predestinarian. Mr. Redfield's first visit was on a beautiful
   Sunday; and the first service was in a grove. The people came from
   miles away. The evening meetings were held in private houses, and God
   was present to save. He says the people were simple-hearted and
   natural. They used no fine phrases nor religious cant, for they were
   utterly unused to listening to the relation of Christian experience.

   "At a meeting one day in a private house, a woman with a child in her
   arms sat swaying to and fro with suppressed emotion, when her face
   suddenly whitened out. Another woman seeing the state of things, took
   her child from her, when she arose and said, "I don't know as I have
   got this good religion what I hear you talk about, but I do feel so
   good and warm all along up here," at the same time putting both hands
   on her breast. It required no doctor of divinity to tell that she was
   happily converted to God. Soon forty or fifty were converted and formed
   into a class, and then the people set to work to build a church. In
   eleven months from the time of the first conversion, the house was
   finished, paid for, and I was invited to come and preach the dedicatory
   sermon. It was in the evening. Just before preaching I said to the
   first convert, "Jacob, when I am done preaching, I want you to give an
   exhortation from the altar, and invite the people to come forward to
   seek religion." When I was through he did as I told him, and such
   another exhortation I never heard. Its effects convinced me that God's
   tools are adapted to their work, and far more efficient when selected
   from among the people who are saved, than all the labored and
   scientific productions of those inexperienced in the things of God can
   be.

   "The exhortation ran something like this: Now, sinners, I tell you,
   look a' here; I tell you, you don't know how good this good religion
   is. Oh, I wish you would come up here and kneel down and get it! You
   know I used to drink rum like anything, and swear, and play cards. But,
   oh! how good this good religion!'! Oh, do come, and kneel down and get
   it."

   "To my astonishment stouthearted men as well as others flocked to the
   altar of prayer. When the meeting closed, I said to Jacob, "You and I
   must go all over this place and exhort the people to get religion; and
   we will begin tomorrow morning."

   "In the morning we started on our mission. In the first house we
   visited were two families. In the first room sat an elderly woman
   weeping, who was at the meeting the night before. Jacob left me to talk
   with her, and he went into the other part of the house to talk with
   those there. As soon as he was gone the old woman said to me with deep
   emotion, Oh, that sermon Jacob preached last night made me determine to
   get this good "religion."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 18

   Mr. Redfield was now invited to a church in one of the suburbs of New
   York city. This church was sustained, mostly by the Home Missionary
   Society. He found a small class of humble people, who had been kept
   down by the proselytizing efforts of a worldly church in the same
   community. One of the difficulties had been that the revivals in the
   Methodist Episcopal Church had been of such a superficial character,
   that this proselytizing was possible. Deep and thorough religious
   experiences would not be so easily overcome. As this church was
   fashionable and worldly, he was satisfied that it was from no abundance
   of piety that it so strongly persisted in its attempts to draw away the
   Methodist converts. He clearly saw that the only protection to those
   who would be converted in his meetings, as well as the prosperity of
   the church for which he labored, was to lay the foundations of the
   revival in holiness. This would be so out of harmony with the efforts
   of the other church, as to make it difficult for it to sustain a claim
   to being Christian. At the same time the revival would be seen to be so
   in harmony with the Bible and the will of God, and that would make
   young converts strong to resist proselytizing influences. Again, it
   would require such a deepening of the experiences of those who were
   already members of the church that they would be prepared to lead young
   converts wisely and safely. This church struggle had been of practical
   benefit to the Methodist class, in that it had kept the eyes of the
   membership open to the evils of worldliness in the church, and also the
   evil of mere church zeal. It also made them the more ready to receive
   and stand by the strong truths of the Bible. Here he had an opportunity
   to labor freely, without opposition from within the fold, although
   there was plenty of opposition without. He scarcely had commenced
   operations, before two clergymen of the other church commenced to war
   against him. At first they advised the people to stay away, because the
   Methodists were simply going to have one of their usual times of
   excitement. When the meetings began to get hold of the people, and
   particularly of some of the more choice in the community, one of these
   preachers began to visit them and to coax them to join his church. It
   soon became necessary for Mr. Redfield to defeat these efforts, if
   possible, the immediate occasion of which, Mr. Redfield says, was as
   follows:

   "A man who had been converted and whose wife was a seeker, had been
   strongly urged, and finally had consented, to join this minister's
   church. One evening the man came inside the altar to labor with some of
   the seekers, and I said to him, "I am told that you and your wife
   design to join the other church as soon as she is converted." Yes,"
   said he, that is our design."

   "I said to him, "Don't you do it; for they will press your religion out
   of you, and press final perseverance into you, and you will lose your
   soul by it. You won't join them, will you?'

   "No," said he, "I will not."

   "I went to his wife, who was kneeling at the altar, and asked her, "Why
   is it you do not find what you are after? Do you give up your whole
   will to God?'

   "Oh, yes; I think it is given up."

   "Well, if God wants you to join the Methodist Church, will you do it?'

   "She was startled with the question, and I saw her will was against it;
   and fully believing that for her to join that church would be to
   surround her with influences that would make it almost an impossibility
   for her to be saved, I said to her, "You may rest assured, God will
   never touch your case until you are willing to join the Methodist
   Church."

   "Do you think so?' she asked.

   "Yes," I know it," I replied.

   "Then, I'll be willing," she said.

   "But, will you join the Methodists?' I asked.

   "Again she seemed to draw back, and I saw that here the difficulty lay;
   and I said, "I am satisfied you will never find the Lord until you make
   up your mind to join the Methodists."

   "Well, I will," said she; and instantly shouted, "Glory to God! I have
   got it."

   "Various other plans were adopted to draw our people away from us, but
   without success. All the converts, without an exception, united with
   us, which so strengthened the society that it ceased to need missionary
   help, and began to help others.

   "After the failure of the two preachers either to stop the revival or
   proselyte from us, their own people dismissed them. One of them was so
   displeased at this that he exposed the fact that there was but one
   communicant in the society, the remainder simply sustaining the
   minister as an item of upper-tendom luxury. The other, for drunkenness,
   stealing church funds, horse-racing and night-revelling, was soon after
   silenced." "I have also learned that the great opposition to the
   thorough work of God, is from nominal professors of religion, who have
   never been converted, or who have backslidden from a good experience;
   but the severest of all is from professed ministers of the gospel. I
   also came to know that whatever others might say or do, I must maintain
   God's rights, and will, at all risk and expense. In doing this I found
   I must contend against any and everything that did not bear the mark of
   God's approval, and that nothing short of this will give that character
   to the church that will prevent it from downright formalism. The
   supposition that there are redeeming traits in human nature which only
   need disciplining, rather than a radical change; and the use of
   appliances to polish and adorn, instead of rooting them out, will, if
   allowed to prevail, banish heartfelt religion from the world.

   "I have also learned another important lesson, namely, that God demands
   harmony and purity among his people. One night, at this place, when the
   altar was well filled with seekers, we came nearly to a stand-still. My
   soul for a moment seemed crushed within me. I cried to God to remove
   the hindrance; when I was instantly impressed that there were those
   among us of whom God would say, "Remove from before me the vile, and
   then offer your sacrifice., So strongly did this come, and so plainly
   did it appear to be in the way, that I arose from my knees, and getting
   the attention of the congregation, I stated my impressions, and asked
   that those present who were conscious of wickedness in their hearts,
   and of opposition to the work now going on, to have the goodness to
   leave the house. Three members of the class immediately left; but no
   sooner had they done so than the converting power of God fell upon the
   congregation, and souls that were seeking were soon set at liberty.
   What was more remarkable was the fact that for twelve or fourteen
   successive nights after, we had a like experience until we could
   succeed in getting those very persons to leave. One of those persons
   was afterward expelled for gross immoralities. Another was proverbially
   deficient in the Christian spirit, and the other was hypocritically
   acting the part of a friend to our faces, but behind our backs and with
   infidels talking against the work of God.

   "While we were holding meetings at the church, the colored people held
   meetings in a private house, and the power of God was among them in a
   wonderful manner. One night a young woman who had been under deep
   awakening for some time, suddenly arose and ran toward the door,
   determined to get away from the leadings of the Holy Spirit. Before she
   reached the door she fell to the floor in great agony. She would rise
   on one elbow and cry, "O Lord, have mercy! Lord, have mercy! Lord, have
   mercy!" and then sink back to the floor again, to all appearances,
   senseless. In a few minutes this was repeated, and so continued for
   seven days and eight nights. Some thought she would die, and called me
   to go and see her, which I did. She had then been in this condition
   several days. I tried to offer Christ to her, and also to find out what
   her particular trouble was. Though I persisted in my efforts for some
   time, and called to her in a loud voice to tell me what the matter was,
   she paid no regard to me, and seemed neither to see nor hear anything.
   Still, at regular intervals she would rise as I have described, and
   utter that cry, and then sink back to the floor again. She obeyed no
   call of nature during this time, except once when she swallowed a few
   drops of milk which was put in her mouth. She lay on a bed prepared for
   her on the floor, and there continued during the period stated. Two
   Christian women slept in the room, nights, to watch her. The eighth
   night, when all had retired to rest, and the light put out, the poor
   girl continued to be exercised as before. At last she changed the
   wording of her prayer to, "Here, Lord, I give myself away. "Tis all
   that I can do," and instantly began bounding, and jumping, and praising
   God. As soon as the first gust of glory passed, she sank to the floor
   from weakness caused by her long fasting and want of rest; and they fed
   her by the teaspoonful until she could bear a more hearty meal. When
   she came fully to herself, she said that she had seen the awful state
   of the damned, and it was that which had so distressed her and kept her
   in such agony for so long a time. She proved to be a remarkable
   specimen of the converting power of God."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 19

   The success of the meeting described in the last chapter, deepened Mr.
   Redfield's convictions that the preaching of holiness would conquer the
   world for Jesus, and that it was his duty to follow the same course
   wherever he went, since it had proved successful in every instance
   heretofore. In conscience he could choose no other course.

   In response to a call, he went to a neighboring city. Before he
   commenced work in the church to which he had been invited, he met the
   pastor of another society in the same city, who desired his services
   for a few days first. A meeting had been in progress here for six
   weeks, but not one conversion had occurred. He accepted the invitation,
   and went to work.

   Speaking of his experience here he says, "I tried to preach the class
   of truths which the Holy Ghost led me to preach. I called upon the
   membership as Methodists to seek the blessing of holiness, as the sure
   course to have a revival among sinners. But they would not move." The
   preacher then expressed to them his surprise at this, and urged them to
   come. But they did not respond to his invitation. After the meeting was
   dismissed some of them sharply reproved him for pressing them to take
   such a stand before the world. To save himself he threw the blame on
   Mr. Redfield, and the next day told him plainly that he did not like
   his preaching, and that he believed he was backslidden, and for that
   reason thought everybody else was. Mr. Redfield says, "A few years
   afterward the same minister astonished me with his attentions and
   endorsement, in a place of considerable importance, where the
   dignitaries of the church, because of my success in the place, were
   paying me unusual attentions. here he could not do enough in words and
   affability to show himself friendly. But his course deeply pained me. I
   thought, if I am not right I ask no man to endorse me, and I value no
   man's friendship who cannot do it when I am an object of scorn for
   representing an unpopular truth."

   He returned to the church which first called him. Here he found a
   people and pastor right in theory and effort, and the first night
   fifteen professed to have found the blessing of holiness. The work
   among sinners also broke out in great power; and in a short time about
   three hundred were converted.

   He now felt sure that the church would see that success would follow
   the preaching of holiness, and the effort would become general. But he
   was doomed to disappointment. He says, "I learned little by little that
   there was a deep-seated hostility to holiness, especially among the
   preachers, who evidently leaned towards a worldly policy, and a desire
   to prune Methodism of all that was objectionable to pleasure-loving
   professors. I had heard that one of our preachers had said in urging
   worldly people to become religious, "The time has come when a man
   without a profession of religion cannot find access to genteel
   society." I also had another proof that a worldly policy was gaining
   ground in many places, and that a time-serving spirit swayed the
   councils of the church sometimes. One of the bishops, who has since
   learned that it is hazardous to stand with God against all sin, told me
   of some things that indicated the downward tendency of Methodism to an
   extent that I had not known. He was deeply grieved over it, and feared
   the final results. But he gave me some counsel, advice and
   encouragement, that led me anew to hope for success and to resolve
   undauntedly to pursue the thorough way. I could now say, "I know of one
   bishop and one preacher who will try to stand for God and the right." I
   believe that the most of them were as they thought in favor of a high
   degree of piety; but I was equally sure that they had more confidence
   in their own ideas of propriety and consistency than they had in the
   leadings of the Holy Ghost. But in charity to them I believed that,
   taking a rational standpoint, they did the best they could. I thought
   that with the accession of new preachers who were clear and straight
   (and I knew a goodly number of them that were about to enter the work),
   and with one bishop who could be relied upon, that the work of holiness
   would certainly be revived, and we should again see our Fletchers and
   Bramwells and Abbotts, blessed men, whose influence would be like
   ointment poured forth. Again I was doomed to disappointment, for I
   found not only hostility to the doctrine, but successful efforts were
   put forth to put down these revivals, and when it was accomplished, the
   sneering remark would be made, "It is another of Redfield's revivals,
   and you see what it has come to."

   At times he would be greatly discouraged, and almost give up the
   struggle. Then the words would come, "Live while you preach, but no
   longer," and again he would arouse to greater diligence and
   faithfulness than before. At such times the manifestations of the
   divine favor that he received were beyond even his wonderful powers to
   describe. He would say at such times, "It is worth a life of toil and
   disgrace to feel that God approves, and none can know the sweetness of
   it who has not tasted it."

   He found new fields of labor were opening before him, and calls came on
   every hand; but, usually, they came from mortgaged churches, and nearly
   extinct societies. Here there was but little to lose, and the
   authorities would give him freedom. This was good so far. To succeed in
   such places it was necessary for him to raise the standard of piety to
   where the Bible puts it, and this would greatly shock both pastor and
   people. The piety and even the morals of the membership were generally
   of so low a type, and the contrast between the standard he presented
   and the characters they manifested was so great that it was with
   difficulty sometimes that he could induce the pastor to suspend
   judgment until God could redeem his cause by giving unwonted success.
   In speaking of this he says, "The good results of course would follow,
   as God's Holy Spirit will always work with the truth." When the victory
   came, pastors would say, "I did not think your course would result so
   gloriously. I shall now know what to do at my next station."

   One said to him about this time, "I once saw things in this light, and
   tried to pursue the course you do, and had the same results; but I
   found that influential ministers in the conference began to look upon
   me suspiciously, and to utter murmurings against me, such as "unsafe,"
   "injudicious," "behind the times," "an old fogy," and "not a good
   representative of our church." Besides, I knew what they did to other
   men who took the same course you do; they were proscribed, sent to
   starvation appointments, or were located."

   Mr. Redfield says the ministers would sometimes ask him, "What system
   do you use, that works so successfully? Do you preach a regular course
   of sermons?"

   "My answer would be, sometimes, "Oh, no! I take the rough, unpopular
   Methodist truths that preachers who hope to be bishops and presiding
   elders dare not use. Though I would leave them at such times evidently
   in the best of feeling, thanking the Lord that one more preacher was
   won back to primitive piety, and could now be depended upon to do
   thorough work for Jesus; still, I have been shocked often to find that
   within one year the same preacher had fallen back to the same state of
   cowardice, inefficiency and indifference, and some of them would enter
   their protests against the Redfield revivals."

   In one place to which he went, the preacher was sick and unable to
   attend the meetings. The work broke out in glorious power. Some of the
   members immediately began to seek and obtain the experience of perfect
   love, while others opposed it. "When the former would go to the
   pastor," says Mr. Redfield, "and speak favorably of the meetings, he
   would fall in with them and approve of all. When the latter would
   complain to him of my preaching on dress, etc., he would fall in with
   them and promise to stop me when he could get out. After a little he
   began to circulate slanderous stories about me. These came out after I
   left. I remarked to some one that I would not be surprised if he was
   out of the ministry in less than five years. In a very short time he
   was called to account for a scandalous crime, and deposed from the
   ministry."

   He found in this place some who had once enjoyed perfect love, but who,
   from yielding to persuasion not to testify of it, had lost the
   experience. One of them was a Class Leader. When Mr. Redfield began to
   preach holiness, he was the first to come out and seek it. The baptism
   came upon him in great power. He was employed in a large factory, and
   the next time he went to work he asked permission of the foreman to
   address the other employees on the subject of salvation. This was
   granted, and Catholics and infidels listened to him as, with streaming
   eyes, he told them of Jesus' power to save. Some cold members of the
   church heard of it, and were terribly shocked at his course. But God
   wonderfully blessed the man; so much so that when he got home from his
   work he sat down and shouted aloud the praises of God. One member of
   the church, greatly shocked, came in great haste for Mr. Redfield to go
   and see the brother. From the words and manner of the messenger he
   supposed the brother was in a fit of some kind, and he caught up his
   medicine case and hurried to the house; but on entering he found the
   brother clapping his hands and shouting, "Glory, glory to God!" while
   his face shone with a heavenly radiance. The excited messenger was now
   more shocked to hear Mr. Redfield join the brother in the praises of
   God. Excitedly he exclaimed:

   "I don't like this, at all!"

   "Well, it's none of your business," replied Mr. Redfield; "this brother
   is not your property; he belongs to God, and God has a perfect right to
   bless him all he pleases."

   "But," said the other, "what if he never gets over this? what will
   become of him?"

   "He'll never be fit for another horse-race, as long as he lives," was
   the reply.

   "Well, I wouldn't have that spell on me for five hundred dollars," said
   the frightened man.

   "Make yourself perfectly easy about that matter," said Mr. Redfield,
   "for I assure you, you are in no danger, for God will keep clear of you
   while you are in this mood."

   "About this time," says Mr. Redfield, "I was called to go and visit a
   lady, dying with the consumption. She was reduced to a mere skeleton,
   and to all appearances, might die that night. I tried to point her to
   Jesus as the great physician of souls, and besought her to cast herself
   upon him at once. To encourage her, I told her of a man whom I had
   lately visited, who was sick like her, and without hope, but who was so
   desirous of salvation that he tried to get on his knees, though he was
   so weak that as often as he made the effort he would fall over. But he
   found the Lord, and died in peace. I told her she need not try to get
   on her knees; that the Lord could hear her just as well when she was
   lying down. But as soon as I was gone she insisted upon getting on her
   knees, and with the assistance of a woman who was watching with her,
   she was enabled to do so, and while kneeling by her bedside the Lord
   saved her and healed her in the same moment. One or two Sabbaths after
   that she was in church, giving glory to God, who had healed her soul
   and body.

   "Soon after this, I was called to see a brother who had lately been
   converted, but was now dying with the consumption. I found him
   apparently breathing his last. His wife and sister stood weeping by his
   bedside; and looking on was his only child, just old enough to know
   that his father was sick, and that his mother and aunty were feeling
   badly. The sick man was suffering terribly from suffocation, but his
   face was filled with smiles. I said to him, "Dear brother, if you are
   able to speak again, tell me if you feel Jesus sustains you."

   "With a desperate effort, in monosyllables, he answered, "Oh, -- yes;
   -- I -- am -- so -- hap -- py -- I -- don't -- feel -- it -- and -- if
   -- this -- is -- to -- be -- my -- heaven -- for -- ev -- er, --its --e
   -- nough."

   "I was also invited to go and see a good old sister who, for many
   years, had enjoyed a deep experience in the things of God, but who was
   now passing away to the spirit land. I went in company with her Class
   Leader, and when we entered the stairway leading to her room, the
   counseling physicians in the hall at the head of the stairs had just
   given the opinion that she was then dying. We were invited into the
   room, and her daughter told her that we had come, and then with her ear
   close to the old lady's lips, she was able to get her request for us to
   pray. This we did, and then withdrew but scarcely had we got outside
   the door when her spiritual vision caught a full view of her coming
   Lord, and so great was the strength imparted by it that she raised to a
   sitting posture in the bed, and waving her hand in triumph, declared
   that she saw Jesus; and continued thus to triumph until she passed
   beyond the clouds."

CHAPTER 20

   When the spring came Mr. Redfield went to Long Island to spend the
   summer and recruit. He preached in the villages on Sunday and attended
   prayer and class meetings during the week. Before preaching he would go
   into the woods and plead with God until he received assurances of
   divine help.

   Referring to these times, he says: "While under the Spirit's influence
   and power in preaching, I would often see and proclaim truths that put
   my own experience and piety to the test. I have profited more by trying
   to practice the truths which I have seen at such times, than from the
   preaching of others."

   At a camp meeting in the early fall, his presiding elder requested him
   to supply a vacant pulpit until the season for holding revival
   meetings. This charge had been abandoned by the preacher appointed by
   the conference. Mr. Redfield had no sooner consented to go than he was
   advised by an old preacher not to go, for, said he: "In all my labors
   for twenty six years I have never seen a place so hopeless." But Mr.
   Redfield resolved to make the trial. When he arrived at the place, he
   learned that the society was organized by Jesse Lee, of blessed memory,
   who at the time was sent of God in answer to prayer; that the church
   had once been in a flourishing condition; that four classes had been
   reduced to one; that many of the members had not been in class for
   three years; that one leader had not met his class for a year; that
   some of the members were Universalists; that some were habitual
   drinkers; and that there was an old, unsettled quarrel of twenty years'
   standing between some of the members. This made him very sad. He says:
   "My first visit was to an old man, the principal on one side in that
   quarrel. He asked me if I had come to be their preacher. I told him I
   had. "Well," said he, there is no use, unless you put the people
   through a course of discipline." He then, in a rapid and zealous
   manner, began to bring their sins to light, and to tell me how much he
   had suffered by them. I said, "Hold on a moment."

   "I tell you," said he, "they are not worthy of church fellowship."

   "Wait a moment I interposed.

   "Oh, there's no use of your trying to do anything here amid so much of
   wrong; and everybody knows it."

   "I had to let him go on. When at last he was almost out of breath, I
   managed to make him hear me and got him stopped. I then said: "Now,
   brother, you are much older than I am, and I don't feel myself capable
   of attempting to settle the matter until I have asked God for wisdom."
   At this I knelt, and he knelt with me. I then determined not to rise
   until God melted his heart. I struggled in prayer for some time, when
   at last he began to cry out, "O my God, what have I been about! Lord,
   have mercy upon me! Oh, how wickedly have I sinned against thee!"
   Finally he said, "I want a meeting called, so that I can confess my
   wrong and my sin, for I am the one to blame. A meeting was called and
   the offended members readily received the old man's confession and
   forgave him, and the breach was healed.

   "One of my visits was to old Brother V_____'s, who was one of the first
   members that joined the society. At his house, for many years, the few
   pious ones used to meet to ask God to send them a preacher "after his
   own heart". It was in answer to their prayers that Jesse Lee came and
   organized them into a class. The old brother bad been a very efficient
   leader and exhorter, but now his understanding and memory were in
   ruins. His good wife said to him, "Father, here is the preacher who has
   been sent to us." The old man raised from his stooping position in the
   chimney corner, and, with a vacant, wavering stare, said, "Why-how-is
   your mother? Well? Why you look good." I had heard that pious old
   people, however broken, would sometimes remember well matters of
   religion; and after satisfying myself that he was only able to converse
   in a very incoherent manner, I abruptly inquired, "Father V_____, do
   you know one Jesus of Nazareth?' Instantly his whole demeanor changed,
   and, with an intelligent air, he answered, "Yes, I have known him a
   great many years. He is my Saviour, and he'll not turn me off;" and
   then repeated many passages of Scripture and several hymns, so
   appropriate to the thought he first expressed that I was amazed and
   could hardly assure myself that he had not been trying to play a
   deception upon me.

   "The Sabbath came, and I went to church. A goodly number had come,
   probably from curiosity, to see the new preacher. I had resolved to
   deliver my own soul regardless of persons or conditions, by declaring
   the whole counsel of God. But I saw no favorable indications. After a
   few efforts during the week following to bring about a change, and
   finding it all in vain, I went to sinners and exhorted them to flee
   from the wrath to come. The response from them was, "Go look after your
   ungodly members." Sabbath came again, and I delivered my message in
   view of the judgment. When I was leaving the church, I met the
   principal member of the official board, who accosted me thus, "We don't
   like your preaching here at all, nor the chapters you read from the
   pulpit. Hell is not very popular here."

   "I inquired, "Will you tell me, brother, what I have preached that is
   not Bible truth?'

   "Well," said he, "I believe it is true."

   "Do you want me to preach lies?' I asked.

   "I went home, weeping along the street. I now saw if I was going to
   accomplish anything, I must do it with my might. So Monday morning I
   went to the grove, and knelt before the Lord in prayer. It seemed as
   though the powers of darkness were all about me. The sensations I
   experienced were as if by the hardest effort I was overcoming great
   obstacles and rising higher and higher until my head struck against a
   rock, and I sank back overcome. I arose and sought another place to
   plead with God, and there experienced the same. Thus I continued day
   after day through the week. I would go to the house once in a while and
   get something to eat, and then return to the struggle. Sometimes my
   agony was such that it seemed to me I could rend the heavens with my
   cries for the salvation of sinners. It seemed to me that if I could
   hold on until the victory came I should see them saved. When Saturday
   night came my very brain seemed sore, and the jar of my step gave me
   pain. I felt a kind of bewilderment coming on, but I had received no
   answer I had resolved, in the name of God, to see a break and salvation
   come to the church on the next Sabbath, or an end put to its standing
   as a stench in the nostrils of the Almighty and the world.

   "Sunday morning came, and with eyes sore from weeping, and my brain
   tender from the continual struggle of the week, I walked softly and
   carefully to the church, and into the pulpit. In opening the service, I
   said to the membership: "This day ends my labors in this place. You do
   not want me here, and I do not want to stay, for I am heartily tired of
   pouring water on to rocks. But if God will help me, I will either see a
   break today, or see this ungodly apology for Methodism annihilated. I
   have asked no man's money; I go at my own expense; but I shall go
   straight for God." Nothing seemed to move in the morning. In the
   evening I went into the pulpit again, and announced that I should
   redeem my pledge. Of course this aroused their hate to a high pitch. As
   God helped, I pointed out the track of an acceptable disciple, and the
   only one that could possibly pass the gates of Paradise. At the close
   of the sermon, I asked those, and only those who meant it and would
   take this track, and where needed go to their neighbors and confess to
   them, and pray with them, and who would seek for the blessing of
   holiness until they knew they had it, to rise. I didn't believe I could
   get them to come forward. Two only arose, and they were of the most
   lowly. "Well," said I, "there seem to be but three of us, counting
   myself as one, and God besides; but I think we will try and have a
   prayer meeting." Those two and myself were all that would kneel, I in
   the altar, and they at their seats, about halfway down the church. I
   opened with a short prayer, and began to rise in spirit until I struck
   that rock again. I then asked some one else to pray, but no one
   responded, and I tried again with the same experience and result, and
   the third time, and the fourth, and fifth, until the sixth time, in
   immediate succession. I now felt that this is the last time, and that
   if I did not get the victory, God would say to me, "Let them alone."
   The case was a desperate one, and I knew the world and the devil were
   against me, and the church members who would not kneel; but I said in
   my prayer, "O God, I'll go as far as I can." Again in spirit I began to
   rise, and soon I struck that rock again, and it seemed to shiver to
   atoms. Instantly the house was filled with the divine glory. The two
   who were kneeling with me fell, and their shouts and screams were so
   loud that they alarmed the village. The people came running in to see
   what was the matter, and as they crowded up the aisles and saw the two
   prostrate under the power of God, tears chased each other down their
   faces; and the poor tempted members began one after another to confess
   their hostility, and ask for pardon, and promised to take the track
   pointed out to them. I staid one more week, and forty-five sinners were
   converted. The preacher who had abandoned the work returned, and the
   revival went on in power for some time. Ten or fifteen years afterward,
   I heard from that society, and it still was doing well."

   He was now waited upon by a preacher from a place about seven miles
   away, who said, "I want you to come to our church. We have been holding
   meetings for three weeks, and not one soul is yet converted. And it is
   the request of the Baptist and Presbyterian ministers also, for you to
   come. He went, and without consulting the minister as to what course he
   should pursue, he followed what be believed to be the leadings of the
   Holy Spirit. The first night while he was preaching, some arose and
   went out of the house in great haste, slamming the doors as they went;
   but they soon returned, and did the same thing over again. He learned
   after the meeting was dismissed that they were members of the church
   who took this method to show their disapproval of his preaching. They
   went to the preacher and told him that he must send Mr. Redfield away,
   or he would ruin the church. The Baptist and Presbyterian ministers
   gave him similar advice. The next night the congregation was larger
   than before, though these opposers had prophesied to the contrary. He
   preached as he felt God desired him to. Now none even came to the
   altar, and it was said he had broken up the revival. Two or three who
   had been forward before he came now refused to come. He sent the next
   day to see what the difficulty was, and was informed that they had no
   design of changing their lives at all, but had thought if the
   Methodists praying for them would do them any good, they were willing
   to let them do it. Now they did not care to go any farther. From this
   Mr. Redfield was satisfied that he had not harmed the revival, and
   resolved to keep on in the track on which he had started. Now the
   opposers became very angry, and began to advise the people to stay
   away, for the preacher was not fit to be heard, and was no proper
   representative of Methodism. A prominent infidel met some of them face
   to face, and said, "Let that man alone; he is the only honest man among
   you, for he dares to tell the whole truth. He cuts me up "fore and
   aft," but I shall still go, for I like to see a man who is honest for
   his God." He did keep on, and was converted. Now the war began in dead
   earnest. Ministers of other denominations continued to counsel and
   advise, and their conclusions were that to allow him to stay any longer
   would be the ruin of the Methodist Episcopal Church. This greatly
   emboldened the opposers in the church. The Baptists and Presbyterians
   left their churches and appointed meetings each side of him to keep
   their members away.

   Mr. Redfield went before the Lord with the matter. He says, "I felt to
   say, "O Lord, thou knowest I don't know what to do. Give me thy help
   for this once. Tell me what the message is." A text and subject were
   presented to my mind from which I shrank. I said, "O Lord, that will
   never do; for the people are so much offended now that this will
   produce a perfect tempest and break up the meeting." The instant I
   shrank I was in the dark, and distressed beyond endurance; I now cried
   out, "Lord, show me the way, and I'll follow." Then that text and
   subject came again. Finally I asked the Lord to direct me to some
   appropriate text as corroborative, if that was his will. I opened the
   Bible at random and put my finger down on the words, "Be not afraid,
   but speak, and hold not thy peace, but speak for I am with thee," etc.
   -- Acts xviii. 9, 10. I said, "Lord, I will venture it at all hazards,
   although I am sure that I shall be stopped before I am through." When I
   went to the church I found instead of a small congregation the house
   was so crowded that it was necessary to throw open the unfurnished
   galleries, which had never been used before. The two meetings on either
   side of us, which had been appointed to draw off the people, were
   deserted. But now was to come the tug of war. One thing encouraged me:
   the preacher in charge was a very devoted man. Though he said but
   little, I knew he was ready to identify himself with the right and to
   rise or fall with it. But I expected trouble with the people, and
   especially with the official board. When I went into the pulpit I
   thought, "They will order me out before I can read the first hymn; but
   I will proceed until they stop me." I read for the first hymn the one
   commencing:


   "Shall I for fear of feeble man,

   The Spirit's course in me restrain?

   Or undismayed in deed and word,

   Be a true witness of my Lord?"

   "Such an unction was given that every word fell upon the congregation
   with great power. When I had finished I thought, "Well, I have read my
   hymn, and I have not been ordered out yet;" but the temptation came:
   "If you pray as you feel you will be collared by some of the officials
   and taken out." I resolved to go as far as I could, and just as the
   Holy Ghost should prompt me. When I finished the prayer I thought, "I
   have prayed, and I am not ordered out yet." I read another hymn, and
   after the singing, I announced for my text: "I AM hath sent me unto
   you;" and as the Spirit gave me utterance, I tried to show them, first,
   that my authority was from God; second, that the message was from God;
   third, that the message was unbending in its requirements, and was not
   to be trifled with.

   "I felt an unearthly thrill charging me from head to foot, while the
   place was filled with a sense of the awful presence of God. I soon saw
   that the minds of the congregation were in great commotion; and in a
   few minutes the power of God broke like a thunder clap upon the people,
   and such screaming, falling, shouting, and crying for mercy I had no
   thought of seeing in that place. All denominational lines were
   obliterated in an instant, and Baptists, Presbyterians, and Methodists
   took each other by the hand, and with deep emotion declared this God to
   be their God. After this the work went gloriously. One brother said to
   me that night: "I now see what was the matter with our revival five
   years ago; we did not go deep enough. It was for the want of the strong
   doctrine of holiness that it all fell away, for out of five hundred
   converts we had hardly one left that has not backslidden."

   Mr. Redfield was now invited by a good old brother to come to his help
   in a place about five or six miles away. He had been doing his best to
   start the work without presenting the heart-stirring doctrines of
   holiness. Mr. Redfield felt it his duty to tell the people how
   gloriously the work of holiness would move the work of conversions
   forward, and called upon the church to begin to seek the experience. He
   then asked those who desired to seek pardon to rise to their feet, when
   fifteen immediately responded. The next day the preacher and he visited
   from house to house. At the first house at which they called they found
   the woman rejoicing in the fullness of salvation, while busy at work
   over the wash-tub. She said: "I came from the church last night fully
   resolved to seek for perfect love, and immediately set about it, and
   before morning came God gave me the desire of my heart. It does seem as
   though I never found it so easy to get along before. I tried to sweep
   this morning, and the very broom seemed to move itself. My children
   never seemed so obliging and good as they do this morning. Oh, glory to
   God in the highest!

   His calls to help the preachers were now so numerous that he could
   spend but a short time in each place. He had met with a preacher at a
   camp meeting in the fall who now desired him to come to his assistance.
   It was about ten or fifteen miles distant, in a large and fashionable
   church. There had been a very extensive revival in the church the
   winter before. He went, but with great misgivings about coming under
   the minister's influence, for he seemed to be very superficial in his
   work. They had hardly commenced before he informed Mr. Redfield one day
   that they were invited out to tea. This Mr. Redfield feared was a trick
   of the devil to dissipate his communion with God, and he frankly told
   the minister he dared not go out to afternoon parties of any kind, for
   he had only time and strength to do God's work, and he felt the need of
   being closeted with God every moment when not at church, or traveling
   from place to place. The preacher told him he need not fear any
   irreligious tendencies. Mr. Redfield says: "I was over-persuaded, and
   for once I yielded. When we arrived, I found the parlors filled with
   gay, but intelligent women, some of whom were members of the church. My
   heart sank within me, and I desired to withdraw. But the preacher
   assisted in giving a religious tendency to the gathering; yet this
   forced apology for religion only pained me. Tea was soon passed around,
   and I had paid all the compliments I desired to. As soon as this was
   over I sang a spiritual hymn, and then knelt in prayer, and we
   continued until all the nice and shaped-up order was broken, and God
   came in slaying power. This good beginning was a sample after which we
   patterned, an held social meetings every afternoon in private houses.
   These fitted us for the public services at night in the church, where
   God saved a multitude of sinners. Yet I must say, I think it is
   hazardous to undertake a system of fashionable visiting in connection
   with a revival meeting.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 21

   Mr. Redfield now received a letter from a preacher whom he had met at
   the camp meeting alluded to in a former chapter, and whom he had
   promised to assist during the winter, if possible. At their first
   meeting this preacher was a seeker for perfect love. He had inquired of
   another preacher how he should seek for it, and was referred to Mr.
   Redfield. At first his heart revolted at the idea of going to a local
   preacher for advice; but finally he concluded to do so. "When he came,"
   says Mr. Redfield, "I felt the opposite from what he had felt, and
   shrank from attempting to give him advice. I said to him, "I am but a
   poor unworthy local preacher, and it is asking a great deal of me to
   advise you; but with your leave, I will tell you some part of my
   experience, and then I will ask you a few questions." When I had
   finished my experience, I asked, "Brother, can you say to begin with,
   "The will of the Lord be done?"

   "I ought to," he answered.

   "But do you say, "O God, thy will be done"?' I asked.

   "I do," said he, very emphatically.

   "But hold a moment, brother. Let us see what possibly, may be the will
   of God, and then when you comprehend it, see if you can still say, "Thy
   will be done." God's will is comprehended in two tables -- what you
   must do, and what you must suffer. Now it may be the will of God that
   you should be put down as a very inferior preacher, and be sent out on
   to the frontier, as unfit to represent Methodism in any populous town.
   Now, do you say, "Thy will be done"?'

   "I do," he replied.

   "But stop again. It may be God's will for you to go to Africa, and
   spend your life there; to leave home and society and let your bones
   sleep in the hot sands of that country; now can you say, "Thy will be
   done"?'

   "I do," he again answered promptly.

   "But brother, that may not be your track; for God wants poorhouse
   preachers, and I don't know but that you can in poverty and rags, in
   the poorhouse, show the power of grace to triumph, and that your
   sufferings there will so preach the power of the gospel that some one
   by that means will be pressed to seek religion, who would not by any
   other. Can you now say, "Thy will be done"?'

   "I do," was his prompt reply again.

   "But it may be, brother, that God wants you to testify by the triumphs
   of his grace over pain, and your calling may be to suffer distress of
   body, that the power of grace may so shine out in your case that some
   infidel may be won to Christ, and he become the honored instrument in
   the hands of God of bringing many to Christ, and thus you do more than
   in any other way; now can you say, "Thy will be done"?'

   "And again he said, "I do."

   "Well, brother, you have got just halfway through; and by this you know
   you have the consent of your will to suffer the will of God. Now about
   doing the will of God: you may have duties to do from which your heart
   up to this time has shrunk; the little duties which will put you at
   variance with every one who is not in harmony with God -- "Who is deaf
   as my servant; and blind as he that is perfect," says God -- to take
   sides with God, and never allow yourself to set up a defense of self,
   to be thorough, straight, and honest; to vindicate the rights of God,
   as you would within five minutes of the judgment. You can stand for God
   when protected by men of influence in your conference, but will you be
   as tenacious for all of God's will when all turn against you? Remember
   you will be considered an old fogy, unsafe, imprudent in want of
   charity. You need not abuse men to win a bad name; only be unflinching
   for God, and your name is worth more now than it ever will be again. If
   a man of wealth should pick you up out of the ditch in a starving
   condition, and take you under his care, provide for you, and make you
   one of his heirs, on condition that you keep watch of his interests,
   would you think it right to allow men to come and steal his property,
   for fear you might make some of them your enemies? God has called you
   to be a watchman, and you must on no condition allow, in silence, an
   infringement of his rights. You will meet with ministers who will
   regard it a small thing to be so particular; but no man is too
   particular in matters of sufficient importance for the Almighty to
   notice. The world, a dead church, and time-serving ministers will
   protest against you, and resort to all manner of means, more or less
   dishonorable, to humiliate you. Now can you, do you say, O Lord, I will
   do thy will, if I stand alone? Can God count on you as one who can be
   trusted to do the exact right, when his back is turned, and the church
   and the world conspire to outlaw you for your fidelity?'

   "I do say," he replied, the whole will of God shall be done in me, and
   by me, at every cost."

   "Well, now you are all the Lord's, are you not?'

   "Oh? said he, "it seems to me there is 'something' that I have not yet
   comprehended in this surrender."

   "Well, brother, tell the Lord, when that 'something' is made apparent,
   that you will then give that also."

   "I do," said he.

   "Well, then, you have given all to do and to suffer the will of God,
   have you not?"

   "Oh, yes."

   "Well, then you are the Lord's. Now, brother, who has required all this
   surrender at your hands?'

   "Why, God; has he not?'

   "What, everything?'

   "Yes, has he not?

   "Oh, yes," said I, "now, if he has demanded all, and you have given
   all, do you think he will ever accept it."

   "Oh, yes; if he has required all, and I have given all, he will accept
   it, for he is not trifling with me."

   "Well, if he will accept, when will he do it?'

   "Oh," said he, "I don't feel,"--

   "Well, you are not ready to feel; you are just now ready to believe;
   not that you have the witness, for you have not; but believe on the
   bare promise of God, that having complied with the conditions in giving
   yourself to him, God now finishes the work by accepting you."

   "What, must I believe before I feel?'

   "Brother, do you tell sinners when they are seeking to wait until they
   feel? or do you tell them to take the promise of God for the face of
   it?'

   "Why, I tell them God is to be trusted, and they must credit his word."

   "Is not the promise of God to the sinner, just as good for the
   preacher? or do you want better security, than the sinner has, that God
   will keep his word?'

   "Why, I ought to ask no better security, and I'll try to believe. But,"
   said he, "I don't feel yet!"

   "You have not done all yet. Now, finish the condition "With the heart,"
   not simply the assent or consent of the head, but "with the heart man
   believeth unto righteousness." You finish the work of doing right in
   your compliance with the condition. But, now, it is "with the mouth
   confession is [to be] made unto salvation."

   "What, confess that I feel what I don't feel?'

   "Oh, no; that would be telling a lie; confess what you believe; viz.,
   that God is true to his word, and that, on the bare say-so of God, you
   now believe that he accepts what you have given him."

   "He immediately went to a tent and confessed, not to what he felt, but
   to what he believed; and while in the act of doing so the witness came
   and referring to this experience in a testimony given some six weeks
   afterwards, he said, "it seemed to me that I was like a vessel lost in
   a sea, without bottom or shore; and I was so filled with the divine
   glory and power that I prayed for God to stay his hand."

   "This brother now desired to engage me to come to his charge and assist
   him in a protracted meeting during the coming winter. I told him I
   would, if the Lord permitted, but also told him to go home and persuade
   all the church, as far as possible, to seek the blessing of
   sanctification, and that I would guarantee that, in the meantime, God
   would work upon sinners. He said he would do it, and the following will
   show the results:

   "About two months after this I received a letter from him saying, "I
   wish you to be here next Tuesday to begin a protracted meeting." I took
   a public conveyance, and reached his place on Monday evening. On
   arriving at his house I learned he was gone to a private house to hold
   a holiness meeting. I found the house, and on opening the door, I saw
   the place was filled with people whose faces fairly shone. The
   remainder of the evening was given to testimony, mostly of those who
   had entered into the experience of holiness. These were clear and
   strong. There were a number, also, who testified as seekers of the
   experience. The meeting was one of glorious power. After it closed, as
   the minister and myself were on our way to his home, I asked, "How long
   have you been holding these holiness meetings?'

   "About two months," he answered.

   "How many of the church now enjoy holiness as a distinct blessing?" I
   asked.

   "I think the largest proportion of them are now in the experience, and
   almost all the remainder are pressing after it," was the reply.

   "Do you remember," I asked, "what I told you at the camp meeting? that
   if you and your people would keep at the work of holiness, God would
   work in the awakening of sinners?" I inquired.

   "Yes, I do," said he.

   "Do you know of any cases of awakening?" I further asked.

   "No; I don't -- not one," he replied, and then calling to one of the
   leaders who was walking near us, asked: "Brother H_____, do you know of
   any sinners who are serious?'

   "No," said the brother, "I don't know of any.

   "Well," said I, "this beats me; for I never knew it to fail. I believe
   yet that you will find that God has been doing something."

   "Tuesday afternoon came, and we met at the church, but there was no
   sign of any stir among sinners. It was the same at the evening service;
   also Wednesday afternoon and evening. Thursday afternoon we seemed to
   have come to a halt, and could not stir. As a last resort we called
   upon the church members to come to the altar to renew our
   consecrations, and others to seek the blessing of holiness. In a few
   minutes it seemed as though the powers of darkness were let loose upon
   us. The preacher cried out: Hold on! Steady faith! Steady faith!" and
   all at once the power of God fell upon us, and there was a great crying
   out among sinners; and one or two came to the altar screaming for
   mercy, and soon were hopefully converted to God. From this moment the
   work went on in great power.

   "The next morning one of the Class Leaders came to the preacher and
   said: "Brother O____, my cousin who is an infidel and never goes to
   church, does not seem to be as hard as usual. He goes with his head
   down; and I would not wonder if you might be able to talk to him about
   religion. Will you and Brother R_____ go with me to his house and see
   him?'

   "Down to his house we went and were introduced to his wife, and sat
   down to wait for the leader to go to the man's shop to call him. As
   soon as he came in at the kitchen door and saw us in the other room, he
   waited out, "O God! O God! what shall -- what shall I do? Oh! oh! oh!
   God, what shall I do?' I felt like getting the Bible and directing him
   to a promise to the brokenhearted sinner to read for himself, and asked
   his wife, "Have you a Bible in the house?' She arose and went to a
   cupboard over the fireplace and took one out; he caught sight of it as
   she handed it to me, and broke out, "Oh, that poor neglected Bible!" I
   took it and turned to the words, "Come unto me all ye that labor and
   are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and
   learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest
   unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." I held
   them before him, and said, "Look at that and read it." He brushed his
   long hair from his eyes with his band, and gazed through his tears upon
   the precious words. "Read them for yourself," I said.

   "With emphasis he replied, "I am reading it."

   "Well, I want you to believe it," I continued.

   "I am believing it," he answered, and burst into such a tempest of
   shouts as made the whole house ring.

   "His wife now cried out, "O God, have mercy on me," and commenced to
   wring her hands, walking the floor back and forth, and crying, "What
   shall I do? what shall I do?' The little children, who were too young
   to appreciate the feelings of the parents, began to cry aloud. In a few
   moments the mother was happy in the Lord.

   "As soon as the first gust of glory had passed over, and the man had so
   far recovered from the overpowering effects of his joy that he could
   talk, he said: "Now, I know what all this means; I know what all this
   means." He then said he had not been to a church for two years; but,
   about two months before had felt sadly impressed that some great
   calamity was about to befall him. "I thought," he said, "perhaps, I am
   going to die, or some member of my family is going to be taken away.
   But now I see, it was the Holy Spirit convicting me; and now I have got
   religion."

   "The preacher went down through the main street of the town, calling
   upon the people, and I returned to his house, After awhile he came back
   with the glad tidings that God had indeed broken up the entire place.
   Said he, "As I was passing the first store one of the proprietors
   called me in, and there at one of the counters stood his partner
   weeping, and as I entered, he inquired if I could tell them how to he
   saved. I directed them as well as I could, and started on down the
   street. As I was passing the courthouse the jailor asked me to come in
   and pray for him, for he wanted religion. When I left, and was passing
   a lawyer's office, he accosted me, and asked, Sir, can you tell me how
   to be saved?'

   "I continued laboring with this brother a few weeks, but as the work
   was going well enough without me, I went where I was needed more. In
   one of the meetings, before I left, I counted about forty who testified
   about like this: "Some two months ago, while I was at work At my store
   (or shop, or on the farm, as the case might be), I felt the awakening
   Spirit of God had got hold of me, and I sought and obtained mercy." But
   not one was there of all who professed to be saved while I was there
   who referred to any preaching or any meeting whatever, as the means for
   awakening them."

   He now went at the request of a minister to a small city where the
   Methodist for many years had been robbed by systematic proselytizing of
   all who would be of financial benefit to a church; and this by open
   hostility.

   Mr. Redfield resolved to break it up, by the help of God. He plainly
   saw that people of such a spirit would not properly care for converts,
   and that it would be positively dangerous, in a spiritual sense, for
   them to go into such associations. As soon as he commenced his labors
   they commenced their operations. He made a public statement of the
   case, and told them they must get religion enough to stop such wicked
   work, and go to work and quarry out their own converts, for their
   success in proselytizing was coming to an end. He then warned the
   people against them; saying it would be at the peril of their souls to
   have anything to do with such folks. One minister began to preach
   against the Methodists, and soon after was dismissed by his church.
   Another attempted the same, but his church stopped him after his first
   effort. Some five or six different churches were engaged in the same
   work, but such was the thoroughness of the revival that the young
   converts could see the difference between the true and the false, and
   none of them were lost.

   But a poor drunken Universalist preacher, who had once been a
   Methodist, but after being expelled, turned Episcopalian, and then
   became a Universalist, was not so easy to get along with. He went to
   New York city to find something with which to shake the confidence of
   the people in Mr. Redfield. He was stirred up to this by some of his
   members being converted and leaving his church; and because the new
   church he was building had come to a standstill from lack of interest
   in its completion as one result of the revival. When in New York he
   foolishly laid his plans before some who knew Mr. Redfield, and who
   kindly informed him of them.

   When the Universalist minister returned he reported that Mr. Redfield
   came to the place on a stolen horse, and that he had run away from a
   city about two hundred miles distant in deep disgrace. Mr. Redfield
   concluded to say nothing about it, but leave the man in the hands of
   God, and soon after he died with the delirium tremens.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 22

   Mr. Redfield's extreme and incessant labors now began to tell severely
   upon his naturally frail constitution. For some time each effort to
   preach had greatly exhausted him, and sometimes it had seemed as though
   he would never be able to preach again. Severe attacks of vomiting had
   now set in that indicated cancer of the stomach. He became so weak that
   he was obliged to lie down at the close of his sermons, and let others
   take charge of the altar work. All remedies failed, and, obliged to
   leave the field, he went home, as he supposed, to die. For a long time
   his sufferings were of the most excruciating character. It was six
   months before he entered a church again, and eight months before he
   preached another sermon. During this time his communion with God was
   uninterrupted, and, as the sequel shows, his affliction was to be a
   means of building him up more strongly in the faith. He says:

   "In the midst of the severest pain my soul was so filled that sometimes
   I would cry out, "O Lord, I would not have one pain less." My happiness
   at the thought of having fallen with my armor on, and that I was
   suffering for my zeal for God, and not for wickedness, was
   indescribable.

   "I had found a home with a very kind family who did all for my comfort
   that lay in their power. To all appearances I could live but a short
   time; yet I would not allow any one to sit up with me, and these dear
   friends, without my knowledge, would come into my room in the night to
   look after me. When I found this out, I desired them not to do so. One
   night I locked my door so that they would feel themselves excused from
   watching me. I had scarcely laid down before I felt a peculiar
   sensation like a wave pass over me, from my head to my feet; and with
   it an impression as of a clear voice saying: "This is death." I
   realized my condition, and thought, "They will find my door locked in
   the morning, and after awhile will force it open and find me dead."
   Then I thought, "If this be death, I'll go singing;" so I began the
   song commencing:

   "I am on my way, passing over."

   I sung the first verse and began the second, when my voice failed, and
   I finished it in a whisper. I tried the third verse and my breath
   stopped. I then tried to move a hand, and then a foot, but could not. I
   felt a sensation all through me as though my spirit was about to leave
   the body. My eyes turned upward, and myriads of angelic spirits seemed
   to be hovering over me, as if waiting to bear me home. All my previous
   conceptions of the "innumerable company" were eclipsed by this vision.
   I thought: "How great must be the whole number if the escort for one
   poor man is so without number!"

   "With the same suddenness with which it came on, that wave of death
   passed, and my heavenly visitors were gone.

   "I had often prayed that I might have some testimony that was reliable,
   that the visions that dying Christians so often declare they have, are
   true, and this seemed to be in answer to my prayer.

   "I had seen two sisters, both of them Christians, in quick succession,
   pass away with the consumption. Both of them professed to have found
   the experience of perfect love in one of my meetings. The first one
   gave me a kiss with her dying lips, and declared she saw angels, and
   heard them singing, and that children were mingled with them. She
   called upon her watchers to listen and to look. But one suggested to
   the other that she was out of her mind, to which she responded: "Oh,
   no! now look there! now listen!" But the scene and sound were only for
   herself.

   "Soon after I was called, in company with the attending physician, to
   make the last visit to the other sister. On approaching the sick room,
   she asked:

   "Who has come?'

   "Your physician," was the answer.

   "Well, let him come in. And who is the other?' she asked.

   They told her, and she said: "Let him come in, too."

   "I approached the bed; around it stood her weeping husband and friends.
   Her eyes were already dimmed with the clouds of death. She asked her
   physician: "Doctor, am I not dying? I think I have been all day." But
   the doctor knew not the power of divine grace and dared not answer. The
   more he hesitated the more she urged an answer. "Say, doctor, am I
   dying? You must tell me." He touched her pulse and then her temple, and
   finally said: "Yes, you are now dying." An indescribable smile
   instantly spread over her face; and she said: "Now let everybody come
   in that I may testify to them of the power of salvation in death." She
   then sank into a gentle doze for a moment, and then again aroused
   herself, and with that heavenly smile upon her face she said: "Oh, yes,
   bless the Lord, I am dying." She then reached out her hand, with the
   chill of death upon it, and, taking mine, she asked: "Oh, do you see
   those beautiful stars? I want to testify once more if I can to the
   power of this great salvation. O brother, do continue to preach
   holiness, for, oh, how it saves!"

   "She had been quite offended at first, because I pressed her so
   strongly to give up conformity to the world, but now she seemed eager
   to encourage me to press it on others with all my might, for the
   glorious results were so rich."

   These incidents had made a deep impression upon his mind, and the
   vision described at the opening of this chapter he always thought was
   the fruition of the desire that was created by them.

   While recovering from his sickness, he was invited to preach in one of
   the New York churches. After service he went to Dr. Palmer's to dinner.
   When he had an opportunity to do so, he related some of these incidents
   to Sister P_____ and asked her views in regard to them. She replied, "I
   believe we should have more of them than we do, if we would not make a
   bad use of them;" and then added, "I wish Sister B_____ was here to
   tell you some facts concerning her mother." The door bell that moment
   rang, and in came Sister B_____. Sister Palmer turned to her and said,
   "I wish you would tell Brother Redfield about the remarkable scenes at
   your mother's death-bed." When seated, Sister B_____ related the
   following:

   "My mother enjoyed the blessing of perfect love for more than forty
   years. When she came down with the sickness that ended her life, my
   sister and I watched with her by turns all through it, until the last
   night, when mother said, "Now daughters, you must go to rest, for it
   will disturb me if you do not, for you are so worn. But I said to her,
   "Mother, you do not know how sick you are." But she replied, "I now
   feel quite easy, but I cannot rest and know that you are not resting,
   when you are so weary." My sister left the room, and I fixed me a place
   to lie down out of mother's sight, and hid the light behind the
   fire-board. I had scarcely laid down when the room became as light as
   day. I could see all the furniture plainly, and the texture and
   stitches of the bedding that was spread over me."

   "But were you not dreaming?" asked Mr. Redfield.

   "No," she replied, "that could not be, for I thought of that, and I
   arose, and felt of myself, and tried various expedients to assure
   myself of the truth of the matter. I finally turned and looked at the
   bed where mother was, when I saw a crowd of angels hovering over her,
   with most heavenly faces. They were looking most intently toward where
   I knew mother's face was. I gazed, and wondered that I felt no fear.
   Thus I continued, until I finally thought, "I must have some sleep, and
   will now lie down." But the instant I closed my eyes, my mother called
   me. I sprang up and ran to her side. Daylight had come, and as I
   approached her, she raised her hands and said, "Oh, what a night I have
   had!"

   "Why, mother," I asked, were you in pain? Why did you not call me? I
   did not leave the room."

   "Oh, no! daughter," she said, "I was in no pain, but as soon as you
   left me, the angels came and staid with me all night." The family were
   now called at her request; she gave them her last charge, and then
   passed away."

   Sister Palmer then related a circumstance of interest concerning a
   young lady of deep piety; who, with those around her when she was
   dying, heard most delightful music over their heads; and what was more
   strange, when the funeral procession was on the way to the grave the
   same music attended them, and returned with the family to the house.
   For months afterwards, it was occasionally heard over the place where
   she died.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 23

   As Mr. Redfield's health began to improve, he entered the evangelistic
   field again. He was now more hopeful than ever before that the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, to which he belonged, would have her
   commission renewed "to spread scriptural holiness over these lands."
   His views of the doctrine and the experience, and his methods of
   advancing them, had undergone a new test to him -- a thorough and
   solemn review on the brink of eternity. He now entered the field with
   stronger faith, and courage, and determinations than ever. Several
   ministers of prominence and promise had entered into the experience and
   were clearly and boldly teaching it to their people, and the blessed
   fruit of it, in the conversion of sinners and the sanctification of
   believers, was gloriously manifest. He was now invited by one of these
   ministers to come to his assistance. A protracted meeting had been in
   progress for some time, and a goodly number had been converted. All at
   once the work stopped. Mr. Redfield immediately was in an agony, not
   knowing the cause. He resorted to prayer as usual at such times, and
   one night in church, while thus engaged, his distress was almost
   unendurable. He afterwards thought he ought to have given vent to his
   feelings before the people, but instead of that, he deliberately cast
   it off. As he did so the impression came very strongly to him, "Let
   them alone;" and then he had such a view of their desolation, and being
   forsaken of God, and of their being visited by death, that he could but
   pray it out before the people. He left the place, but meeting with the
   pastor some time afterwards, he was informed that a peculiar disease
   broke out among the people after the meeting closed, and many were
   swept into eternity. The minister also informed him that one cause of
   the revival being checked had come out, and that was the banding
   together of a large number of young men to resist it.

   Again he was invited to a place where he had been before, and was
   assured by the Lord that it was not his will for him to labor there.
   But the correspondence opened the way for him to go to another place
   where Methodism had never succeeded in gaining a footing. Here he
   experienced much opposition from other churches. It was about ten miles
   from G_____ (probably Goshen). There was one church in the place
   occupied by a bigoted old minister who claimed the ground as a sort of
   a parish. He had another flock about three miles east, and still
   another about five miles in another direction, to whom he preached
   about twice a year, besides attending their weddings and funerals. A
   short time before Mr. Redfield's visit, a Methodist man attempted to
   hold a prayer meeting in the village schoolhouse, but so great was the
   opposition that the doors were nailed up so he could not get in. When
   Mr. Redfield arrived he found an Episcopalian lady who knew something
   of the power of salvation, and she invited him to make her house his
   home. Her husband was an infidel, and apparently made so by the unholy
   type of religion he saw about him. The schoolhouse was now open and Mr.
   Redfield gave out an appointment to preach in the evening, and though
   the weather was severe the people came in large numbers. The women kept
   closely veiled, or stood outside and looked in at the windows, and he
   had to do his own singing and praying. He commenced a regular
   visitation of the people from house to house. As an illustration of his
   reception he records the following as having occurred in the house of
   Deacon_____:

   "Good morning, Deacon. How are you prospering in the way to heaven?' I
   inquired.

   "We don't want any of your fanaticism here," was the answer.

   "But I suppose you love God, and his ways?"

   "I tell you, we don't want any elements of discord introduced here."

   "I suppose you have often prayed for the salvation of your children?"

   "Yes, sir; I have."

   "Well, suppose we pray for them now."

   "You are not wanted here, sir; we want none of your disturbance, for we
   are all at peace now."

   "But, Deacon, I think we will pray for your children now."

   "I want you to leave my house."

   "Well, but I think I will pray first."

   "So down on my knees I went, and prayed for the old man and his family;
   and then went on to another deacon's house. I found him alone. His face
   was white with rage. I tried to draw him into religious conversation,
   but he would not answer me. After a long and fruitless effort to get
   him to say something, I at last asked to pray with him before I left.
   "Pray if you have a mind to," was his short and gruff reply. I needed
   no further invitation, and I knelt down and thanked God for the kind
   and Christian deportment of the deacon who was so willing to let me
   pray in his house. The next day the deacon was in the schoolhouse, and
   as soon as there was an opportunity he arose and asked the privilege of
   speaking. I gave him permission, and he proceeded to tell the
   congregation that I was at his house the day before; how mad he was at
   the sight of me; how roughly he treated me; and how I prayed for him
   like a Christian. "But," said he, "after Mr. Redfield was gone I began
   to reflect, and when night came, I went to bed, but not to sleep; for I
   could not. Finally my agony of mind was so great that I got up and
   knelt down before the Lord. It seemed to me I should die before
   morning, and I dared not sleep. I remained all night upon my knees
   praying for my soul, and about daybreak God spoke peace to me, and now
   I have got religion."

   "This testimony took hold upon the congregation with great power."

   Concerning his method of work in this place, Mr. Redfield continues: "I
   did not feel called upon to put any great task or cross upon the
   people, such as coming to any particular place or bench. I could
   discern by their manner those who were sufficiently awakened to make
   the right move. So I asked, simply, that all who desired to be saved to
   stand up. The work soon broke out in great power.

   "An old lady sent for me one day, whose two daughters had been very
   clearly saved, and whose bright testimonies had put the old lady's hope
   in the shade. When I reached the house and was introduced to her, I saw
   her face was the picture of despair. With great emotion she said, "O
   sir, my daughters tell me they know their sins are forgiven, and that
   they know they are the children of God; and I don't know what to think
   of myself." Not to shock her too badly, I thought best to accommodate
   my language to her by the use of the terms in which her church was
   accustomed to speak of religious states of mind. So I replied: "I
   suppose, madam, that you already entertain a hope."

   "Oh, no!" said she with evident horror; "I would not dare to be so
   presumptuous;" and then in a nervous, sententious manner, she said, "I
   -- do -- think -- I -- can -- say -- that -- I -- have -- a -- desire
   -- that -- I -- might -- have -- a -- hope."

   "This is a type of most of what passed for religious experience in this
   place.

   "I found one, however, who knew the power of salvation. She was in the
   last stages of the asthma, and in great suffering from suffocation. Her
   minister had been sent for to visit her, but he did not come. When I
   entered her room I was greatly moved to see her gasping for breath. As
   she could not lie down, she was bolstered up in the bed; her face was
   swollen, her breathing very short and labored, and her voice could be
   heard but a few feet from her. Her sister, with her ear to the sick
   woman's lips, could catch the answers to my questions and repeat them
   to me. I asked her if she found religion a satisfying portion in the
   midst of such great distress.

   "She answered: "I am so filled with comfort and joy that if this agony
   of dying is to be forever I am perfectly content and happy."

   "I went to the afternoon meeting, and there saw the minister, who had
   been persuaded to come and give this poor flock an extra sermon. He was
   about opening the services, so I took my seat and listened. After a
   formal opening, he began his sermon by stating that he was set for the
   defense of the gospel, and while he was upon the walls of Zion he must
   protect his flock from ravening wolves. He then opened his batteries on
   John Wesley and the Methodist Church, and warned his people to keep
   clear of them, and not to forsake the religion of their fathers. He
   then, in substance, told them that he would relate to them what he had
   read in a New York paper. (I had read the same and knew what was
   coming.) "But," said he, "I shall not call names? He then proceeded to
   say: "A man came from New York to a village about thirty miles from
   there, and told the people that they had the devil in them, and they
   must take an emetic which he had prepared for the in, and vomit him up.
   But I am not going to speak his name now. Well, he got some to take it,
   and it was found that they would die, and the constable was after this
   man, but I shall call no names."

   "The meeting closed, and one of the principal men in the place said to
   the minister: "You had better stay to the meeting tonight, Mr. E_____,
   and hear this man preach, and see if you have treated him just right."

   "No," said the minister, "I cannot stay with you?

   "But you have implied some very hard things against Mr. Redfield, and I
   think it no more than right that you should be at some pains to learn
   what you evidently know nothing about."

   "But away he went. One of his members approached me and said: "Mr.
   Redfield, I have hated the very sight of you; and when I saw you
   passing along the street it has been with difficulty that I could
   refrain from whipping you. But I won't see you so abused. And if you
   will build a Methodist Church here I'll give you fifty dollars."
   Another immediately said: "I'll give you a lot." And still another:
   "I'll give fifteen dollars." And so it went on, and in a short time we
   had a church erected and dedicated, and the last I heard from the place
   they had a flourishing Methodist circuit there. The minister's
   opposition laid the foundation for three new churches and built one,
   and made a good appointment for a preacher, and has been regularly
   supplied from conference ever since." (1863.)

   Soon after the close of these labors Mr. Redfield attended a camp
   meeting where he met many of the preachers who had promised him to
   stand by the work of holiness; but he found they had backed down and
   did not know it. They took him one side to counsel with him. They said:
   "Brother Redfield, you know that everywhere you go revivals break out
   in great power, and the people are converted by the hundred and
   sometimes by the thousand."

   "Yes," said he, "I know it, and I know too that it is but the
   legitimate workings of holiness in the hearts of the people."

   "Well, well," said one, "that is all granted; but, Brother Redfield,
   are you willing to take advice?"

   "Most certainly, if it is good."

   "Well, now if you could adopt any way by which thousands would be
   converted where now you see only hundreds,"--

   "Most gladly do I desire to do all I can."

   "Well," said he, and the rest all concurred in it, "if you will not say
   so much about "holiness," "perfect love," and "sanctification," and not
   press any one up to these things, for that makes many people in mad,
   and many of our preachers afraid of you; some say you can never do good
   enough to overbalance the harm you have already done; and you get so
   many prejudiced against yourself, and it must be very uncomfortable for
   you to have to meet so many prejudices,"

   "Well, what would you have me do?" said Mr. Redfield.

   "We would have you cease to use these terms which arouse the prejudices
   of some, and, Brother Redfield, you can preach up Bible religion as
   high as the Bible warrants, but drop the objectionable terms."

   One of the preachers then said: "I am pastor of the church in, where
   the people were so offended at you that they would not let you stay;
   but I have preached the doctrine of holiness up very strong, and have
   done it so cautiously, that no one knew what I was preaching about. And
   they have endorsed it; and now they are willing to have you come back."
   (Mr. Redfield says: "I afterwards went back, and found them worse than
   before.")

   In speaking of this advice, he says: "It is just the thing to take with
   me, I thought. What a Godsend that these brethren have helped me out of
   all my difficulties! I do find, certainly, all the opposition I can
   stand under. I am willing to work without fee or charge, but my nature
   shrinks when called unflinchingly to stand for God, and either in word
   or tacitly tell the time-serving preacher that he is the enemy of God.
   I don't ask any office in the church higher than that of a local
   preacher, but I dare not do otherwise than take that. But now I have
   found an easier way apparently, and a way to accomplish much more for
   God; a way to be for once and forever free from slanders and
   misunderstandings which follow, me all over the land. So out I went as
   soon as the season for protracted meetings began, and attempted to
   preach the best I knew how, and yet avoid the objectionable terms. But
   I found my power with God and man was gone. Two or more weeks resulted
   in but one person being moved, and she so slightly that she did not
   stand a week. Well, thought I, my mission is ended, and God has got
   through with me. So I can now go home and attend to business, and bid
   farewell to this rough, toilsome and heartaching cause. How good it
   will be to feel once more that 1 am not an Ishmaelite, with my hand
   against every man, and every man's hand against me. But before I leave
   the field I'll take counsel of some good man. In casting about for some
   one to give me that counsel, I thought of a pious old colored man who,
   I thought, would be unprejudiced in every way. I went to his home and
   took him out into a grove, and told him all my experience in holiness;
   about my labors; how God had manifested himself in saving souls through
   me, when the doctrine of holiness was preached. I then told him that my
   mission with the great power God had given me was gone and that I
   thought God was done with me.

   "My brother," said the old man, "haint you nebber compermised?'

   "Compromised?' said I, why, no! I would as soon cut off my arm! I dare
   not do that." But recollecting myself, I said: "I have been counseled
   by some good preachers to avoid the use of the terms, perfect love,
   sanctification, holiness, etc., because the people's prejudices were so
   strong against it that they became angry at me and I could not do them
   the good I desired. But I try to preach the Bible truth as high as
   ever."

   "Dat is it. Dare is lust where de trubbel lie. Now what God call
   sanctification, you no bizness to call anysin else. It isn't you de
   people hates; 't is de Lor'."

   "God so let the light shine through this old black diamond that I saw
   there was the very place where I lost my mission and power; and I said:
   "I'll go right back and preach these doctrines right in the notch where
   I used to, and in the meantime seek my power over again." But scarcely
   had I touched the old key before the power came. God had not condemned,
   but dropped me, that I might learn this lesson, that we must follow him
   in all things, great and small."

   He now went to a place where the parish minister not only cautioned his
   people against him, but brought to light an old law which gave him
   authority over the people, even to the use of the rod on minors, and he
   threatened to use it if they did not stay away from the meetings. This
   moved the hearts of the people in the right direction, and a Methodist
   church was built and supplied with preaching as the result.

   He then went to the place where the preacher had won the people over to
   love holiness by preaching it in such a guise that they did not know
   what he was at. But Mr. Redfield found the state of affairs bad enough.
   There again, he had one of his awful burdens. He thought he must be
   fainting away, and went to a window and raised it, and when he found
   the fresh air did not help him, he knew it was a burden. But so intense
   was his agony that he thought he could not endure it, when the
   suggestion came: "Cast thy burden on the Lord." He knelt down, and gave
   vent to his feelings in sobs and groans and tears. The burden passed
   away, and as it did so left him with the feeling that God had withdrawn
   from the place, and his labors there were at an end. This proved to be
   true, and he left.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 24

   Mr. Redfield was next called to visit Middletown Conn., the seat of a
   Methodist university.

   Referring to his call to this field of labor, he says: "My heart
   dreaded the conflict which I knew must follow if I did not lower the
   standard of gospel truth, unless there were those who would take a
   stand for God. But I had promised to go, and I made up my mind to meet
   the worst."

   Rev. B. T. Roberts, now General Superintendent of the Free Methodist
   Church, but who, at the time of Mr. Redfield's labors in Middletown,
   was a student in the university, describes the state of the work there
   at that time as follows:

   "The state of religion in the church was extremely low. Professing
   Christians were chiefly distinguished for their conformity to the
   world. The Methodists had ceased to be persecuted, and were fast
   becoming a proud and fashionable people. In the university,
   intellectual rivalry had well nigh supplanted zeal for the cause of
   God. But a small proportion of the students professed religion, and
   these exhibited but too little of the power of godliness. Dr.
   Redfield's preaching created a profound sensation. His deep-toned
   piety, his fervent, moving appeals to the throne of grace, and his
   unearthly, overpowering eloquence disarmed criticism, even in that
   congregation of critics, and prepared the way for the reception of the
   truths he uttered. Had he lowered the standard to suit the pride and
   prejudices of his hearers, his popularity would have been unbounded. He
   insisted upon the Bible standard of entire conformity to the will of
   God in all things. The church was crowded, and the people seemed
   amazed. Such exhibitions of truth they had never listened to before. It
   was for some time doubtful how the scale would turn. Dr. Olin heard of
   the commotion. He was unwilling to take the representations of any one,
   but arose from a sickbed and went and heard for himself. His majestic
   intellect and deep experience in the things of God could not easily be
   imposed upon; and a candid hearing satisfied him both of the sincerity
   and soundness of the preacher. "This, brethren said he, "is Methodism,
   and you must stand by it." His word was law. The faculty, the official
   members, and the church received and endorsed the truth. Such a work of
   God as followed we never witnessed. Professors in the college, men of
   outwardly blameless lives, saw they were not right with God, frankly
   confessed it, and, laying aside their official dignity, went forward
   for prayers. The city and adjoining country were moved as by the breath
   of the Lord. For some eight or ten weeks the altar was crowded with
   penitents, from fifty to a hundred coming forward at a time. The
   conversions were generally clear and powerful. Dr. Olin seconded the
   effort in the university, and went beyond his strength in exhorting the
   students and praying with them. This great man never seemed so great as
   in prayer. Then he seemed clothed with the


   "Awful majesty of man

   Who talketh often with his God."

   "Nearly all the young men in the college were converted, and of the
   converts a large number became ministers of the gospel. The fruits of
   the revival remain, and have been multiplying ever since."

   More than three hundred were converted at the church. At the same time
   the work was going gloriously forward in the college. The tutors who
   had experienced entire sanctification entered into it heart and soul.
   At first a band of them met together and united in praying for such
   students as they thought were leaders of influence and mischief. At
   these times they would hold on until they thought they had received an
   answer. The first time they met thus, the young man for whom they were
   praying went running and rollicking through the halls as though he was
   possessed by evil spirits. They took this as an indication that the
   Holy Spirit was striving with him and held on. The next night the young
   man was converted at the church. They then informed him of their
   especial season of prayer for him; and asked him to unite with them in
   the same work for others. They selected another, and he soon was
   converted. They then divided into two bands and held meetings in
   separate rooms. A remarkable feature of the work was that the
   conversions took place in the order in which they selected these
   subjects of prayer. Their method and success became known, and had such
   an influence that a student went to one of these praying bands one day
   and asked, "Have you got my name on your list?" On being told that they
   had, he said, "Well, I thought you must have, from my feelings; and I
   may as well give up now." In a few minutes he was converted, and that
   night in the church told what great things the Lord had done for him.

   President Olin took a lively interest in the work, and though in
   ill-health, he undertook to give a ten-minutes' talk to the students in
   a large recitation room one day, but the minutes swelled into hours;
   and the speech was afterward published as one of his great intellectual
   efforts. The result of the revival in the city and at the college, all
   together, was nearly four hundred conversions. Twenty-six of the
   college students became ministers of the gospel. Here the sainted
   William C. Kendall learned the art of soul saving, and went from here
   to preach the same gospel for a short season with great success. His
   was a short but a shining track. He too found himself much opposed, for
   daring to stand for the right.

   Such was the success of this meeting, and the glorious stand taken by
   President Olin and his faculty, that Mr. Redfield began to hope again
   for the cause of holiness in the Methodist Church. He felt sure that
   such an endorsement would silence opposers and give that doctrine the
   right of way through the land.

   Mr. Redfield was now invited to a church in New Jersey to spend a
   Sabbath. He arrived on Saturday night, but did not enter the church
   until Sunday morning. The pastor was to be in New York over Sunday, and
   requested Mr. Redfield to fill the pulpit for him both morning and
   evening. He was careful, also, to request that he would not present the
   subject of holiness that day. When Mr. Redfield entered the church he
   thought he understood the reason why the pastor had made such a
   request. The church was new, and had been ornamented in the highest and
   most costly manner.

   "I felt," says Mr. Redfield, "I must do my duty, no matter what the
   results. But I felt sure the people would not endure it; and in all
   probability I would have to find shelter in a tavern over night. I took
   the money I had from my pocket to assure myself that I had enough to
   pay my fare. When I saw that I had enough, I was at rest, and resolved
   the people should hear holiness for once. I went through regardless of
   consequences, and when the service closed I met some in the aisles who
   grasped my hand and said: "Brother, I believe in holiness, and mean to
   have it."

   He went to a prominent city in the same state to hold meetings. He
   preached on his usual theme, and God responded in power. The people
   often fell from their seats to the floor while he was preaching. But he
   soon found the preacher very much afraid of holiness.

   Here, he again was asked in regard to his family. He told the inquirer
   that it was a matter he disliked to talk about, but that only made the
   matter worse. At last he was obliged to ask that he might meet two of
   the presiding elders, to whom he could tell the whole story. His
   request was granted, and they coincided with his view of the matter,
   that silence in regard to it was his best course. But from this on the
   matter grew worse and worse, until after counsel and advice he put the
   matter in the hands of a lawyer and obtained a divorce. Mr. Redfield
   had not seen nor heard directly from her for over five years, but had
   heard rumors of her death several times.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 25

   Mr. Redfield, about this time, met with opposition from the preacher in
   charge of the society where he held his membership. The issue was made
   on his license, the preacher taking the position that he should belong
   to the society where he labored. This was done on the floor of the
   quarterly conference. Mr. Redfield replied to this that it would be
   very inconvenient for him to do so, as he staid but from four to five
   weeks in a place The preacher was insisting upon it and crowding the
   quarterly conference to refuse the renewal of his license, when the
   presiding elder, Dr. Heman Bangs, came to Mr. Redfield's relief by
   saying: "Brother Redfield is a very useful man, and he must have his
   standing somewhere, and if he wishes it he must have it here. Let his
   license be renewed." It was done, and Mr. Redfield went on his way, but
   with a sore heart. In speaking of it, he says: "If these men only knew
   what it costs me in my feelings to go without home, and face the
   constant apprehension that the misfortune of my family affairs may be
   taken advantage of by my enemies to destroy my influence, while my
   friends are more or less perplexed about it until they understand all,
   it seems to me they would not try to make my way harder than it is."

   He could but observe that the men who were engaged in this opposition
   were not the spiritual men, nor the revivalists, but those who were
   laboring to make the church take rank in culture, splendor and
   influence with other churches. They could but see that the preaching
   and experience of holiness were attended with a renunciation of earthly
   pomp and glory that was fatal to what they were struggling for. They
   also saw that where the doctrine and experience of holiness obtained a
   footing there were marked indications of utter abandonment to what was
   supposed to be the divine will, and demonstrations of great joy at the
   consciousness of the divine approval. This was attended by more or less
   of reproach, and all was fatal to their worldly ambition. It was
   doubtless true that these men were blinded by their own desires and
   prejudices; but this was not strange. It has been the case in all ages
   of the church. Caiaphas was misled in like manner as to what should be
   done with Jesus.

   One marked feature of the holiness revival was that the churches were
   filled with the poor, who gladly listened to truths from which the
   proud turned away. Again, the thorough renunciation of worldliness and
   sin that holiness requires brought such a cloud of reproach upon those
   who preached and professed it as none but the truly consecrated could
   endure. This has in all ages saved the church of God from sinking into
   utter worldliness and degeneracy. Once make Christianity acceptable to
   depraved human nature, and men will embrace and profess it without
   regeneration.

   Mr. Redfield at this time busied himself during the summer in earning
   the means by which he could pay his expenses during the revival season.
   His laboring without fee made it possible for him to get into places
   where otherwise he could not have gained admission.

   About this time he was invited to go to the assistance of Caleb
   Lippincott, a preacher of the primitive stamp, and one of the most
   successful in the church. Mr. Redfield now thought, as he had found a
   preacher who was not afraid of the power of God, they would see a
   glorious work. But he found that the enemy was still upon his track,
   and had more than one way to wage war upon him. The Universalists here
   became the agency to humiliate him. God soon began to pour out his
   Spirit in a remarkable manner, and many had been added to the church.
   Among these were some promising young people from among the Hicksite
   Friends. One night an old lady, whose daughter had just been converted,
   became so enraged that she broke out in the meeting in denunciations of
   all about her. In a loud voice and with violent gestures she said, "I
   don't like this at all. I am mad at you." In the night, at her home,
   she became so distressed in mind that she sent for some of the
   religious women to come and pray with her. She surrendered to the Lord
   and was gloriously saved. Her first utterance after the assurance of
   salvation came was, "Oh, how I love everybody!" The work went on in
   great power for some time. The house was crowded with people and the
   altar with seekers. All at once, Mr. Redfield noticed a falling off of
   the congregation, which continued until the attendance was so small and
   the interest so low that he concluded that his work in that place was
   done. His next appointment was but fourteen miles away, and he procured
   a conveyance and drove to the place. This was on Tuesday. When he
   arrived, the minister with whom he expected to labor told him that the
   meeting was advertised to commence the next Sunday. Mr. Redfield could
   not bear the thought of four days' idleness, so he returned to the
   place he had left. During his absence that day the secret of the
   decline of the meetings came out. A Universalist paper had been
   circulated in the community in which Mr. Redfield had been published as
   a notorious villain, connected with John Newell Maffit, the noted
   evangelist, who was at that time under a cloud of dishonor. Of the
   matter charged in this paper. Mr. Redfield had never heard. It was also
   charged against him that he was making the revival meetings he held a
   matter of gain in money and fame. As soon as he had read the article he
   determined to meet it with a public statement. That evening in the
   pulpit, before preaching, he made a statement of what had been
   published, and said to those present, "When the congregation is large
   enough, I'll tell you something worth two of this." The next night the
   congregation was greatly increased, to which he made a similar
   statement; and again, in like manner, the third evening.

   On the fourth evening the house was crowded, and a great many stood
   outside around the open windows. When he arose, he said, "I will now
   tell you my story." He prefaced it by reading the newspaper item; and
   then proceeded to say, "Of this matter in regard to Mr. Maffit, I can
   say, first, I am able to prove that I could by no possibility have
   known anything of the matter at all; second, I was never alone with Mr.
   Maffit five minutes in my life; and as to being in league with him to
   break up the Methodist Episcopal Church, I never knew until now that he
   was charged with any such thing. As to going about in this manner for
   money and fame, I can say, I have never in any way negotiated with any
   church or persons for one penny for all or any of my traveling
   expenses. I will allow, however, that when I left here last Tuesday
   morning a brother of this church put in my hand two dollars and
   compelled me to take them. Now, it cost me twenty-one shillings to come
   here, and this brother gave me sixteen. So you see I have not made
   anything here, nor did I ask or expect it. As to my laboring for fame;
   these charges are the fame I get. I will sell any man all of it for
   three cents. I am aware that the curious desire to know why I am thus
   going about, and what is the impelling motive for it. I will tell you.
   You yourselves must know, that I am ether a fool, or crazy, or honest.
   If a fool, do not be too hard upon me. If crazy, I need your pity. Now
   no man in his senses will follow the track I am on without a motive;
   and I'll frankly own, though I do not make a practice of dwelling on
   these matters, that I am where I am and doing as I am, because I dare
   not do otherwise. For this I have been brought to the verge of the
   grave, and then let off on the promise that I would go and preach the
   gospel. And the last time, the word came to me, "You may live as long
   as you preach but no longer." I dare not disobey. Now, if the president
   of your Temperance society (he was the one who had circulated the paper
   with the charges in against me) was to be thus treated, because he
   tried to win your drunken husbands and sons back to a virtuous life, do
   you think he would deserve it? While I have been here in your midst
   every day, when the weather was pleasant I have spent the most of my
   time out in yonder grove on my knees, and sometimes on my face, before
   God, pleading with him to spare you and save your husbands, and wives,
   and sons, and daughters. You yourselves will bear me witness that I
   have not tried to persuade any one here to lie, steal, swear, fight or
   get drunk, or to do anything that is wrong. On the contrary I have
   tried to make everybody better, kind, loving, happy and comfortable,
   and to help them to get ready for the world to come -- and this at my
   own expense, and in the face of slander and persecution."

   Here Mr. Redfield's feelings overcame him and through his tears he
   concluded by saying, "I do not think I should receive this kind of
   treatment." The tide of influence turned, and the meetings went on with
   greater power than ever.

   Mr. Redfield says: "This was the only instance where I felt called upon
   to say a word in self-defense."

   Soon after he was invited to go back to the city of New York to hold
   meetings in one of the large churches. He says: "We began on Monday.
   The church immediately commenced to seek the experience of holiness.
   The first night fourteen were converted; the next night, eighteen; the
   next, twenty; amid so the number increased through the week. Sunday the
   house was greatly crowded, and especially so in the evening. During the
   preaching in the evening God was present in great power. When through
   with my sermon, and I was about to invite seekers to the altar, the
   preacher stopped me, saying: "Wait a while; I am going to marry a
   couple before the prayer meeting." I said: "O brother, don't! I am
   afraid you will divert the attention, and destroy the interest of the
   meeting."

   "I can make it very solemn, and besides I have promised to do it," he
   replied.

   "For the Lord's sake, and souls' sake," I pleaded, "don't do it. You
   will crush out this interest."

   "Well," said he, "I shall do it."

   Cannot you take the couple into the basement?' I asked. "Don't break us
   up here."

   "But in spite of my entreaties he arose and commenced the ceremony by a
   brief lecture on the nature and solemnity of marriage. In a few minutes
   I saw our opportunity for getting people saved that night was lost. He
   finished the ridiculous affair, and we tried to have a prayer meeting,
   but the Spirit had been grieved, and the effort was a failure. The
   revival came to an end right there."

   Mr. Redfield went from this to another church where some three hundred
   had professed conversion. He expected to preach but one night. When he
   was through with his sermon the pastor followed with remarks, and asked
   if the meetings should close. The congregation voted, No. He then
   asked: "How many will seek religion if the meetings continue?" About
   five hundred arose. The meetings went on for some time, and the
   conference minutes showed afterwards that about five hundred additional
   ones were taken into the church.

   These successes were very assuring to Mr. Redfield of the wisdom of
   preaching the doctrine of holiness. He was also much encouraged by the
   promptness and thoroughness with which a minister was dealt with in an
   eastern conference for publishing a pamphlet opposed to the Wesleyan
   view of the doctrine. He was required to renounce his pamphlet, and to
   promise not to preach his peculiar opinion. This minister then took a
   transfer to another conference.

   About the same time Jesse T. Peck, afterwards bishop, published a work
   on the subject, entitled, "The Central Idea of Christianity." Quite a
   controversy on this subject had arisen in the church, and the new book
   was written in defense of the true doctrine. Much of it appeared in one
   of the church periodicals first. It was finally published in a
   permanent form, after being enlarged and adapted to popular use. This
   work discussed every feature of the doctrine that now attracted the
   public attention, but not in a controversial manner or spirit. To read
   it now, one would scarcely gather from its pages that the doctrine was
   ever disputed. The work soon became an authority on the subject, and
   has been used in the course of study for preachers in at least one of
   the Methodist bodies of America.

   Some strong men were enlisted on both sides of this controversy. In
   favor of the doctrine as held by the early Methodists were found Nathan
   Bangs, the first historian of American Methodism; the author of "The
   Central Idea"; Joseph Hartwell; and, not the least in the tribes of
   Israel, Phoebe Palmer. On the other side were Hiram Mattison, C. P.
   Bragdon, and others.

   Mr. Redfield now thought the doctrine was safe, and the return of the
   church to her ancient simplicity and power was assured; but he
   subsequently wrote, "I had yet to learn that hostility to right never
   ceases."

   He went to spend the winter in Philadelphia. He labored for a while in
   St. George's Methodist Episcopal church, the oldest church of that
   denomination in the city. It had been the cradle of Methodism. The
   pastor had lately been brought into the experience of perfect love, and
   entered heartily into the methods and labors of Mr. Redfield. God
   greatly poured out his Spirit, and many were saved. In the midst of
   this success, the minister who had been required by his conference to
   renounce his pamphlet and promise not to preach his peculiar views,
   appeared upon the scene amid commenced to oppose the work then in
   progress. But God had given the doctrine of holiness such favor in the
   eyes of the people that the work went on in triumph.

   Mr. Redfield now visited another church by especial request, but was
   permitted to preach but once.

   He then visited another church. Here he found a state of revival. Some
   three hundred had already been converted. The pastor said: "We have had
   a great work. I desire you to preach a few sermons on holiness to help
   us regain the spirituality we have lost in our efforts for others. I
   think it will do us good for you to do so."

   Mr. Redfield had a favorable opinion of the moral state of the church,
   and thought it in a good condition to take hold of the doctrine of
   holiness. But he asked the pastor: "Do you know what you ask? Are you
   prepared to allow the doctrine of holiness to be pressed upon your
   people?"

   "I don't know what I have to fear," he answered.

   "Well, let me tell you," said Mr. Redfield, "my impression is that the
   introduction of that doctrine will be accompanied with results beyond
   your conception as to their magnitude. Why, sir, this work has but just
   begun."

   "Well," said he, "I'll risk it."

   The doctrine of holiness was made the theme of the meetings. In a few
   days it became necessary to close and even lock the doors after the
   church was comfortably filled, in order to work with success. The
   scenes of power were most remarkable. The saved would shout, jump,
   fall, so as to block the aisles. Sinners in the midst of this would
   crowd their way through and sometimes climb over the seats to get to
   the altar, and when that was filled, they would sometimes fill a row of
   seats clear across the church. So great became the press of seekers,
   and the violence of the commotion, that the preacher became alarmed and
   abruptly closed the meetings.

   Mr. Redfield then went to two other churches, but was permitted to
   preach but once in each, and then took the meetings to private houses.
   The work of holiness went on in power. The last afternoon meeting,
   fourteen were sanctified.

   He then visited many places in quick succession, stopping but one or
   two -weeks in each. During this time, he saw many souls saved, but
   afterwards thought he had made a mistake in leaving most places so
   soon.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 26

   Mr. Redfield went now to a place on Long Island where a Methodist
   church had been compelled to contend for a bare existence against the
   opposition of other churches. One minister was very violent in his
   opposition. He warned the people against attending the meetings,
   especially while Mr. Redfield was there. This only aroused their
   curiosity, and the house was full from the beginning. Among those who
   came the first night was an infidel school teacher. The next day he
   said to his scholars: "Tell your parents I have been to the meetings
   and have heard the new preacher. Tell them I say he is the only honest
   preacher in the place, and if what he preaches is religion, it is
   worthy of their fullest confidence. Tell them to come out and hear for
   themselves."

   They did come; God owned the truth, and revivals broke out in different
   places in the vicinity besides, and many souls were saved. The minister
   here was a good man and had been very successful; but he was now nearly
   worn out from excessive labors.

   From this place Mr. Redfield went to the former home of Freeborn
   Garrettson, one of the pioneers of Methodism. Here he found the widow
   of that soldier for Jesus still living, and in readiness waiting for
   her summons to the mansions of the blest. Among the tokens of
   friendship he received here was a set of Benson's Commentaries from
   Mrs. Garrettson. These had belonged to Mr. Garrettson, and had his
   autograph upon a blank leaf. Here some fifty or sixty were saved.

   Mr. Redfield next went to C_____, about fifty miles distant. Here there
   was a powerful work among sinners, resulting from the church entering
   into the experience of holiness.

   On leaving C_____, Mr. Redfield went to labor in the suburbs of New
   York city again. Here there was not much accomplished, as the church
   did not readily embrace the experience, nor welcome the doctrine of
   holiness. It was early in the fall, and the people did not feel
   sufficiently released from business to enter upon a revival campaign;
   so he abandoned the effort.

   While here he was constantly waiting upon God to know where he should
   spend the winter. One day there came before him the peculiar sign that
   had indicated the will of the Lord many times before. He got a map of
   the United States and found the sign to point in the direction of
   Cincinnati. He had before this been invited by Bishop Hamline to visit
   that city, and he now resolved to enter every open door that led in
   that direction. Soon a brother from Philadelphia came and invited him
   to return to that city where he had spent the previous winter. He
   resolved to go because it seemed to lead toward Cincinnati. But that
   night his track was laid out for him in a dream. He must begin at
   Goshen. The next morning an invitation came from Goshen to help in a
   protracted meeting there. He told the minister from Philadelphia that
   he would go to Goshen and write to him from there. His reasons for this
   decision he kept to himself.

   Goshen was a county seat, and had a very bad name. A Methodist bishop
   on passing through the place some years before found that there was no
   Methodist preaching in the place, and at the next meeting of the Home
   Missionary Society presented the matter. A minister was sent, but found
   no place in which to preach. The principal church building in the place
   was an old affair, and the membership of the church led such
   inconsistent lives that it had very little influence for good. The
   place seemed almost given up to skepticism and drunkenness. A new
   church was finally built by the denomination that owned the old one,
   and the latter passed into the possession of a gentleman who allowed
   the Methodists to occupy it. But it was in such a bad condition that
   many considered it unsafe. The Methodist preacher finally raised money
   to build a church, but when he came to purchase a lot, the only one he
   could buy was a frog pond.

   Undaunted by this, he had the pond drained, and built his church. The
   new church was to be the scene of Mr. Redfield's labors. The preacher
   was a gentleman and a Christian, and stood by the evangelist as he
   endeavored to preach the straight, plain truth. Some of the poor
   members were badly frightened, at the thought of losing caste with the
   established church of the place if they should obtain a higher type of
   piety than they now enjoyed. The editor of the local paper was a deacon
   in that church, and he used his paper to bring the meetings into
   disrepute. The rumsellers became violent in spirit, and accused the
   evangelist of proving himself a bad man by destroying their business.
   They complained that they had lost about sixty dollars during the first
   three weeks of the revival; and if the meetings went on, their families
   would soon suffer for the necessaries of life.

   When the other churches found they could not drive the Methodists out
   of the town, they tried to build themselves up by proselytizing. Some
   of their members began to come into the meetings and to sing with the
   young converts, and to make much of them, and at last to lead them
   before their church officers to be received into church fellowship.
   When about sixty had been received into the church to which the village
   editor belonged, his paper changed its tone, and instead of saying
   anything more about the unhealthy excitement of the Methodist meetings,
   it spoke of the gracious revival in the _____ church.

   The infidels, to cast odium on the meetings, got up a mock prayer
   meeting. The wife of the ringleader, at whose house this meeting was
   held, became frightened and left. Her husband went insane before their
   meeting closed. He declared he was lost forever, and in a few hours he
   was dead. The next Sunday this man's funeral sermon was preached in the
   Methodist church by the pastor. This interposition of Providence put a
   stop to all opposition to the revival, and the work of God went
   gloriously forward.

   An attempt was made, soon after, to proselyte the more influential of
   the converts. Mr. Redfield finally announced from the pulpit that he
   was aware of what was going on, and threatened if he found them trying
   to proselyte the colored people or the ragged poor he would expose
   them. One of the converts was a rich old man, who some twenty years
   before was awakened, and went to a deacon, and asked how to find peace.
   The deacon asked him what was the prevailing sin of his life, and, on
   being informed, told the man that he was a reprobate, and there was no
   mercy for him. The man then concluded that he might as well enjoy
   himself as best he could. But eight years before the meeting now being
   described, this man had a dream, in which he was told that he would yet
   see a man who would tell him how to be saved. This made such an
   impression upon his mind that the next morning he told his wife and the
   deacon that he was sure he was not a reprobate. The night of his
   conversion was the first of his attending the meetings, and when he
   returned home he said to his wife: "I have seen the man of whom I
   dreamed eight years ago. He has told me how to be saved, and I have
   found it. Now I shall join the Methodists."

   Another was a wealthy merchant, who had been president of the village
   corporation and was quite influential. The same old deacon who had told
   the other man that he was a reprobate could not bear the thought of
   losing this man; so he came early one morning to talk with him, but
   found Mr. Redfield present. At this he seemed disturbed, and said, "I
   hope I do not intrude." When assured by the man of the house that he
   might feel perfectly free, he inquired:

   "Well, Mr. B_____, how do you feel?"

   "I don't have any evidence of my acceptance yet," the reply.

   "Evidence!" said the deacon. "You know Deacon R_____ He never had any
   evidence; and everybody thought he was a good man. But all the evidence
   he ever had of his conversion was, his heart felt as hard as a stone."

   "But," said Mr. B_____, "if I only knew that God heard my prayers, I
   should take hope."

   "Hear your prayers? said the deacon. "Why, we have been praying for
   more than twenty years for a revival, and you see it has just come."

   Said Mr. B_____, "I am now anxious that Mr. S should go with me."

   "Oh," said the deacon, "you need not trouble yourself about Mr. S_____,
   for if the Spirit begins with him he will have to come

   Mr. Redfield had felt that the man to whom the deacon was talking
   needed, especially, to have a thorough experience. He had been seeking
   earnestly for a number of days, and that night he was at the altar
   again for prayers, when the following conversation took place:

   "Brother," said Mr. Redfield, "what is the reason for your not being
   converted?"

   "I don't know; he answered.

   "Do you make a full surrender to God of all you are and have?"

   "I do."

   "Will you give to God every dollar you own, and let him make a draft
   upon you to any amount, at any time."

   "I will," was his prompt reply.

   "Will you at once begin to pray in your family?"

   "Why, would it be right before I am converted?" he asked.

   "Certainly. God commands all men to pray."

   "I will," said he.

   "Further, my brother, will you go out and exhort sinners to come to
   Jesus?"

   "Would that be right before I get religion?"

   "Surely; for God says to every one that heareth not only to come, but
   "let him say, come.",

   "I will," said he.

   The meeting closed without his finding relief. He went alone to his
   store; the clerks were all gone, and going down upon his knees, he gave
   himself up to God -- person, property, and all. He then went home, and
   set up his family altar. In the morning, early, he went to the home of
   the gentleman he had felt such an interest in, and said: "Mr. S, I have
   come on a strange errand to you this morning. It is to ask you to go
   with me and seek religion."

   In deep emotion, Mr. S replied, "I will. Mr. B_____, pray for me."

   "I have never tried that yet; but if you will kneel down, I will try."

   They knelt, and while Mr. B_____ was praying for his friend, God
   converted his own soul.

   The deacon heard that Mr. B_____ was converted, and went to see him
   again. He now insisted upon Mr. B_____ 's going before the session of
   his church. When he had him there, he pressed him hard to unite with
   that church. Said he:

   "You will not think of joining the Methodist Church; it will surely
   injure your standing if you do."

   "Oh," said Mr. B, "I may be too zealous for your church. I must go
   where I can save my soul alive."

   He finally united with the Methodist Church and became a useful Class
   Leader.

   The doctrine of holiness was made the prominent theme of this revival
   meeting, and the young converts were, many of them, a few days after
   their conversion, in the clear enjoyment of the experience.

   One young lady who had been thus saved, was badly burned by the
   explosion of a fluid lamp she was filling. While her friends were
   endeavoring to extinguish the flames at the pump, she sang the hymn:


   "Am I a soldier of the cross?

   A follower of the Lamb?

   And shall I fear to own his cause,

   Or blush to speak his name?"

   A physician was called, who pronounced her not in danger of death. But
   she declared she was going to die; that her soul was full of glory, and
   that she wanted to be with Christ. On dressing her arms, the flesh fell
   from the bones. She lingered for a few days in great pain, but glorious
   triumph, and then passed away. Thus was demonstrated the genuineness of
   this work of grace, and the soundness of the teaching that was used by
   the Holy Spirit in bringing it about.

   It was estimated that more than four hundred persons were converted in
   this revival. This mission appointment became self-supporting, and an
   aid in the support of other missions.

   Mr. Redfield next went to a place seven miles from Goshen, where the
   Congregationalists had been holding a meeting until it was broken up by
   the roughs. He found the community greatly demoralized, and mostly
   through the scheming of a professor of religion, a member of a church
   which was jealous both of the Congregationalists and the Methodists. He
   and an infidel commenced operations the first night of Mr. Redfield's
   meeting. After the service had closed, Mr. Redfield asked the
   membership:

   "Why do you allow such conduct in your meetings when the law protects
   you?"

   "They always do so when we commence a protracted meeting," was the
   answer. "They have just broken up the Congregationalist meeting."

   "But you must stop it."

   "We dare not meddle with it."

   "Well, I hope you will not put that burden upon me: but one thing is
   certain, if you don't take the matter in hand I shall," said Mr.
   Redfield.

   The next evening the house was greatly crowded, and in the gallery was
   that professor of religion, and his infidel accomplice. They began
   their disturbance by throwing missiles at the ladies who were coming
   in. The congregation was engaged in singing. Mr. Redfield called upon
   them to stop, and pointing to the infidel, said in a loud voice, "I
   hope that young man with the white cravat, will be civil enough to
   cease throwing things at the ladies." The infidel made an insulting
   reply, and Mr. Redfield said, "Sir, we know our rights. A Methodist
   church is not a tavern nor a grogshop, and our rights are respected by
   the law, as well as those of any other church. Upon my honor as a man,
   I promise to see that the ladies who attend these meetings shall be
   protected by law. The legal penalty for disturbing a religious meeting,
   is a fine of twenty-five dollars, or imprisonment in jail until the
   fine is paid. I will meet every person who disturbs these meetings at
   the magistrate's office, and will see that the law is executed. And you
   may tell your friends that they can come to the Methodist church and be
   respected."

   It was very quiet that night, but the next morning one of the rowdies
   with some companions was seen standing in front of the church. He began
   to curse the members and Mr. Redfield, in a loud and very blasphemous
   manner. Suddenly he fell to the ground. His comrades thought he was
   dead. They took him to the tavern, removed his clothing, and put him in
   bed. After a while he came to, and exclaimed, "O God; what have I been
   doing." He confessed his wrong: his companions were frightened, and all
   opposition to the meetings ceased. Within ten days from the time the
   meeting commenced, more than one hundred persons were converted. The
   church that had inspired such opposition now tried to gather the young
   converts into their communion, but they were too clear and strong to be
   easily taken in that manner. After Mr. Redfield was gone, the pastor of
   that church undertook to have a revival. The first night he announced
   that they wanted no shouting, nor singing of the songs used by the
   Methodists, nor any fainting away (as he called the losing of
   strength). But he invited all who desired to become Christians to rise
   to their feet. Only one arose, and that one had been seeking at the
   other meeting. In a few days the meeting came to a close with no
   further result.

   A request now came to Mr. Redfield to return, and make an effort to
   save the respectable part of the community, as the uncouth rabble had
   all been converted, and the probability was that the others would now
   be willing to accept of salvation. He considered that there was but one
   gospel and one salvation, for the rabble and the genteel, and as they
   had refused that, he had no other to offer.

   His next meeting was in P_____ I_____, on Long Island. Here he found a
   state of things similar to that at the last place. He told the preacher
   he must command order, as God had given them the benefit of the law.
   But he replied "The great difficulty is, some of the disturbers are
   children of our own members." Mr. Redfield then determined to do his
   duty. The second evening came, and the rowdy element was very
   boisterous. He tried to quiet them by kind words for a season, but in
   vain. At last he got their attention, and told them to make one more
   demonstration if they dared, and he would see the law enforced the next
   morning. All were hushed immediately. The next night seventeen of the
   rowdies were at the altar, seeking for salvation.

   In this meeting, the afternoons were devoted entirely to the experience
   of holiness. The second afternoon the wife of a sea captain was
   forward, seeking for perfect love. In her consecration she came up
   against the question of giving up her husband. The enemy tempted her to
   think that if she gave him up the Lord would take him away, and she
   would never see him alive again. At last she was enabled to make the
   consecration, and the power of God fell upon her. As soon as she could
   she arose and testified to being saved. The work now opened with great
   power, and many were saved.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 27

   Mr. Redfield was next sent for to spend the winter in Boston. But
   before he started he received a letter from the preacher in Chelsea,
   near Boston, asking him to spend a few days there before commencing in
   Boston. He agreed to this, and went immediately to fill the engagement.
   He found the preacher a courageous, faithful man. His congregation was
   worshipping in a hall, as their church edifice was not yet completed.

   As usual, Mr. Redfield commenced his work by showing the standard of
   religion to be what Wesley and Fletcher and the fathers of Methodism
   had declared it to be. God owned the truth. The hall was crowded
   nightly with a congregation made up from various orthodox churches. He
   had labored but a few days before he was waited upon by a committee
   consisting of several laymen and one Methodist preacher. They told him
   they had come to labor with him, and, if possible, to disabuse his mind
   of some misapprehensions that he evidently entertained.

   He replied, "Brethren, do your whole duty."

   Said the preacher, "By your strong and sweeping declarations against
   all who do not come up to your standard, you reflect upon the
   Unitarians and Universalists. You evidently don't know them. Besides
   you offend some of our members whose friends belong to these
   communions. I regard them as good people, especially the Unitarians;
   and if there is any choice between them and the Methodists, it is in
   their favor."

   Mr. Redfield could hardly repress his astonishment at such a
   declaration from a Methodist preacher; and replied, "Your good
   Unitarians and Universalists have the devil in them."

   He was interrupted by one saying, "You ought to know that such rough
   deportment will not be accepted in a place as refined as the city of
   Chelsea."

   "Well," said he, "if you know the doctrines of Methodism as you ought
   to know them, if you are members of the Methodist Church, as you claim
   to be, I will this night prove to you that what I say is true. As
   Methodists, you know that our doctrine of holiness is love, and nothing
   but love. I think matters are ripe for it, and tonight, I design to
   present the doctrine of perfect love; and if it don't smoke out devils
   I will give up that I am wrong."

   Accordingly, the theme that night was holiness as a state to be
   attained now. While he was preaching, a young man, of a large and
   powerful frame, fell like a dead man to the floor. The people were
   alarmed, supposing he had fallen in a fit. Several went to him and
   carried him out of the hall. As soon as he could speak, he cried out,
   "Glory to God! You need not hold me. God has given me the great
   blessing." He came in again, and walking up the aisle, testified as
   follows: "While Mr. Redfield was preaching, I said, "O Lord, I never
   heard about getting the second blessing. Now if the doctrine is true,
   let me know it by laying me out on the floor." Instantly I fell as if I
   had been shot. Now I know I have got the blessing; and I love God with
   all my heart."

   One of the Class Leaders immediately arose and said, "if that doctrine
   has got in here I am done with the Methodist Church. I am a
   Universalist."

   Then another leader arose and said, "I will have no more to do with
   Methodists for I am a Unitarian."

   But the work went on in great power, and when Mr. Redfiefd's time was
   out about one hundred had been converted.

   He now went to Boston, and presented himself at the parsonage of the
   church in which he had engaged to labor. The minister was an old man,
   and had never met Mr. Redfield. When he found he had come he seemed
   frightened, for he had heard terrible stories of the measures used in
   Chelsea, reported by the preacher of the committee already alluded to
   and the infidel Methodists who had left the church.

   The good old man, to make it as easy as he could, said, "We have had
   some meetings, and I don't think the brethren will be willing to open
   them again." Mr. Redfield saw his embarrassment and dilemma, and as
   quietly as possible withdrew and returned to Chelsea. But the good man
   went over and saw for himself, and, when he returned, persuaded his
   people to let Mr. Redfield come and preach once, that they might know
   him for themselves.

   A goodly number of his congregation were superannuated Methodist
   preachers, engaged about the book-room in the city. Of course they had
   heard all the reports that were in circulation, and were afraid of Mr.
   Redfield. When the time came for the appointment, the meeting was held
   in what was called the small lecture-room of the church. Mr. Redfield
   perceived what this meant, but went straight forward about his work. At
   the close of the meeting several of these old preachers said, "You must
   stay tomorrow night, and we will open the large lecture-room." Mr.
   Redfield did so, and took the strongest stand he could for primitive
   Methodism. God blessed the truth, and in a few days the main
   audience-room was opened, and in a fortnight forty or fifty were
   converted.

   He had now accepted an invitation to a place about two hundred miles
   distant. But the preachers of Boston, who saw how they had been
   deceived by false reports, urged him to remain. The old preachers of
   the congregation had told them that the objectionable things were the
   peculiarities of old Methodism, and that those who had left the church
   of Chelsea were Unitarians in sentiment. About the same time
   Prof._____, of the Wesleyan University, came to Boston and bore
   testimony to Mr. Redfield's soundness as a Methodist. This so broke up
   the opposition that the ministers of the city endeavored to engage him
   for a year. Greatly encouraged by this, Mr. Redfield promised, if it
   was possible, he would return. But the opportunity to do so never came.

   He now went to U_____, as he had promised. Again the doctrine and
   experience of holiness was the theme and the apparent means of arousing
   a great religious interest, and many were converted.

   One night he observed a youngerly man sitting in the front seat who
   appeared to be greatly interested in the work. Others sitting with him
   manifested the same kindness, though none of them took part in the
   altar work. After the meeting Mr. Redfield asked one of the brethren,
   "Who are these persons who seem so pleased when people come forward?"

   "Why, don't you know them? They are _____ists, and _____ists, and
   _____ists."

   "Well, what are they doing here?"

   "Oh, they are watching those who come forward, to see if there are any
   that they want. If any of influence come forward, they will soon be
   after them. They never allow the Methodists to get any one here of
   importance if they can help it. They say they can do better by the
   upper class than we can; and that we are well adapted to help the lower
   classes. They help us financially, for they say we are doing a good
   work, both in filling up their church and ours. One of our preachers
   once asked one of theirs, "If the Methodists should hold all their
   converts what would be the result?' The answer was, "Our growth would
   be comparatively small."

   Mr. Redfield saw one night that these watchers were greatly elated over
   something that had occurred. After the meeting closed he asked one of
   the brethren what it meant.

   "Oh," said he, "the man who knelt at the corner of the altar was one of
   such as they are after."

   The next evening Mr. Redfield heard the bell of one of the churches
   ring, and he asked, "Are they going to commence revival services?"

   "No," was the answer, "they are to have an experience meeting tonight."

   "What is that for?"

   "Don't you remember a man who knelt at one corner of the altar last
   night who attracted much attention?"

   "Yes; I do."

   "Well, they are to open the doors of the church for him tonight."

   "But he was not converted last night!"

   "That makes no difference in this case."

   The man was received, settled down satisfied with what he had done, and
   having been addicted to strong drink, within a year was in the gutter.

   While here Mr. Redfield met a local preacher who was also a school
   teacher, whose wife had opposed his preaching. But if he did not preach
   to a congregation at least twice a week, he would preach in his sleep.
   He would repeat the hymns, call on some one to pray, and then take a
   text and preach in a regular manner, but so loud that it drew the
   attention of the neighbors, who would gather about the house to listen.
   This so humiliated the wife that she gladly yielded to his preaching
   regularly.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 28

   Mr. Redfield visited Newburgh just before the camp meeting held near
   there that year. He endeavored, as usual, to present the truths of real
   Methodism. Some Episcopalians who had united with the church, entered
   into the experience of holiness, and shouted in their newfound liberty;
   while some Methodists who had never belonged to any other church,
   became angry and opposed the work. The pastor was displeased, but the
   old presiding elder stood by the doctrine, the experience, and the
   work.

   In its early history Newburgh was completely under the control of
   infidels, who intimidated Christians and those who desired to be
   Christians. They were very violent and blasphemous, but nearly all of
   them died violent deaths, and their passing away left impressions that
   went far to contract the influence of their lives. Mr. Redfield spent
   but a few days here, as the camp meeting soon commenced.

   At the camp meeting he did not feel much liberty for a day or two.
   There was evidently an effort on the part of the preachers to get along
   without him. On Thursday afternoon, one of the preachers, after
   exhausting his skill in trying to make things go, turned and said:
   "Brother Redfield, can't you do something?" He answered in a loud
   voice, "No! but I know of one that can. The Lord Jesus Christ will take
   the whole matter into his own hands, and no man can stay it, if you
   begin at the right end by getting holiness." He was permitted to take
   the meeting, and in his peculiar way he set forth the conditions of
   full salvation, and called upon all who would meet these conditions to
   kneel at the mourner's bench. They were in a large prayer-meeting tent.
   Many immediately knelt, evidently understanding what they were about.
   But scarcely had they engaged in prayer before the slaying power fell
   upon them, and sinners, without an invitation rushed forward to find a
   place to kneel as seekers. The tent was eighty feet long with a row of
   seats running the whole length through the center. During the remainder
   of the camp meeting, without cessation, that bench was filled with
   seekers, and sometimes two and three rows on each side, the men on one
   side, and the women on the other. As soon as any were converted, they
   would be taken away to make room for others, and there seemed to be
   some one waiting to take the vacant place at all times. No one had to
   exhort, or to persuade penitents to come. God was there in awful power.
   One remarkable thing was that many, in relating their experiences,
   testified that they were convicted at their homes two and three miles
   away, and on coming to the campground, were drawn to this tent. Nothing
   was said at any time on the subject of dress, yet fashionable ladies,
   with their bonnets filled with artificial flowers, would struggle and
   weep and cry, and when all else failed, would put up both hands and
   tear the flowers out, and in a few moments, smiling through their
   tears, they would make the woods ring with their shouts of joy.

   Such was the crowd of penitents that it was necessary to open another,
   though a smaller tent, for those seeking holiness; and these two tents
   became great centers of spiritual power.

   The first night after starting the meeting in the second tent, when ten
   o'clock came, the hour for closing all services according to the rules,
   the meeting in this tent was going on in greater power than at any time
   before. The Committee of Order sent one of their number to close the
   meeting. When he came several remonstrated with him against his action,
   but he persisted in it. While engaged in his effort, he was suddenly
   stricken to the ground; and the Spirit seemed to be poured out in
   greater power still. The increased noise showed the other members of
   the committee that their man had not succeeded, and they dispatched a
   more resolute one to his assistance. He had not more than reached the
   tent before he was also smitten to the ground. Again the shouts of
   praise and the cries for help from the Lord rose higher and stronger
   than before. A third man was then sent with orders to bring the meeting
   to a close, at all hazards. When he arrived and saw the other two
   committeemen prostrate, he beat a hasty retreat, and informed the
   remaining members of the condition of the first two, and that if they
   desired the meeting closed they must do it, for he would have nothing
   to do with it. The meeting was no more interfered with, and ran on
   until after daylight the next morning. It was estimated that more than
   one hundred were converted in the other tent during the night. When we
   consider that this wonderful work commenced immediately after Mr.
   Redfield took hold of the meeting in the circumstances of the afternoon
   previous, we cannot but conclude that it was a demonstration of the
   correctness of his method.

   This incident gives a clue to his wondrous power to break through to
   victory on occasions like that; and also illustrates the close alliance
   of the two phases of revival work, -- sanctification and pardon.

   The afternoon following, Mr. Redfield was leading a meeting for
   holiness, and while pointing out the details of perfect submission to
   the will of God, an old minister present, exclaimed, "You lay too many
   burdens on the people;" but when Mr. Redfield came to speak of the
   final act of faith, he cried out, "You make it too easy." When Mr.
   Redfield finished speaking, the same old minister said to him, "If I
   could see this course accompanied with demonstrations of power, I would
   think more favorably of it." Just then a call came for Mr. Redfield to
   go to another tent where several persons were anxiously seeking, and he
   invited the old minister to go with him, saying, "Perhaps the Lord will
   give you the demonstration you desire." When they arrived at the tent
   they found a large number of persons present, all seated, but some of
   them in deep struggles of soul.

   In his own account of this matter, he says, "Among them was a large,
   strong woman, whom none would call nervous, but who was wringing her
   hands, swaying back and forth, and audibly praying, "O Lord, I must
   have it; I shall die without it. I can't live any longer in this
   manner." I perceived that her consecration was complete, but she was
   making the mistake of trying to obtain the experience by will power.
   All present seemed to expect me to get down and by vociferous praying
   to heighten her emotions, and by this tempest to help them all. But
   instead of that I sat down by her side and endeavored to get her
   attention. This was quite difficult to do, but I finally succeeded, and
   then I inquired:

   "What do you want?'

   "Oh," said some, "I want to be entirely sanctified."

   "How much do you want it?'

   "Oh, I would give all I have."

   "Are you sure of that? Are you willing I should turn your heart inside
   out, and let all your desires be seen just as they are?'

   "Yes, I am," she replied.

   "Well, I can't do that, but I asked it for your own benefit. You now
   know you are honest. This is the starting point, honesty. Don't let the
   devil drive you from that point. Now, with that honesty, can you, will
   you say, The will of the Lord be done?"

   "I do," was her prompt reply.

   "Will you say this, and let God take you at your word in a moment?'

   "I will," she answered, very emphatically.

   "I then described to her a possible example of suffering, and remarked:
   "Remember, God may take you at your word. Now, in view of anything he
   may ask, do you yet say, "Thy will be done?'

   "Again she answered, "Yes."

   "I then described to her an example of duty, of going from house to
   house in the city of New York, where she lived, and asked: "Will you do
   this if God wills it?"

   "She answered: "I will do that when I have the grace to do it with."

   "But, sister, is God at fault, that you have not the grace of perfect
   love up to this time?'

   "Oh, no! God is not at fault."

   "Well, can you, will you, say, blessing or no blessing, if visiting and
   exhorting from house to house would be my duty if I had the blessing, I
   will not let my disobedience in the past be an excuse for disobedience
   in the future; I will go and do that duty?"

   "Yes, I will," she replied.

   "Well, sister, who has required all this of you?"

   "Enquiringly she looked up and said, "Jesus; has he not?"

   "Oh, yes!" I replied; "and now I ask, sister, if Jesus has required all
   this and you have surrendered, do you believe he will ever accept of
   it?'

   "Most certainly," said she, "for he is not trifling with me. He will,
   won't he?"

   "Oh, I don't doubt it," said I. "But the only question now is sister,
   when do you think he will accept of what you have just surrendered?'

   "She stopped as if a new thought had struck her; her face changed, and
   the next moment she shrieked out, "NOW!" and fell to the ground, where
   she lay and made the woods ring with her hallelujahs.

   "But I do not think the old minister was satisfied with this
   exhibition, for he shortly after was making complaints of some who fell
   while they were repeating the doxology, though several were converted
   and a number sanctified.

   "The sister who came out so brightly, went home from the camp meeting,
   lived a faithful life, and died triumphantly a few years after."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 29

   Immediately after the camp meeting described in the last chapter, Mr.
   Redfield went to a small village a few miles away to spend the Sabbath.
   A number of retired business men, residing in the village, had built a
   commodious church and had presented it to the Methodists. The preacher
   appointed had staid away from the camp meeting to prepare a
   controversial sermon on baptism, which Mr. Redfield was destined to
   hear the following Sunday. Of course the appointment was out for this
   special sermon, and the door for the evangelist was closed for the
   morning. The minister was careful to keep it closed in the evening,
   also. An invitation to conclude the service gave an opportunity for a
   brief exhortation, in which Mr. Redfield set forth the type of religion
   that would save. The minister was very restless, but did not interfere.
   At the close of the service one of the men who had built the church
   came to the minister and asked who the stranger was who had spoken. The
   preacher thinking he was about to be reprimanded for allowing Mr.
   Redfield to speak, began to apologize, and said, "He is a local
   preacher from New York city."

   "Well," said the inquirer, "if that is Methodist doctrine, why do you
   trifle with us as you have, by giving us bosh? Why not like an honest
   man tell us the truth?"

   The poor preacher for the time was humbled.

   Mr. Redfield began to observe many such instances of unfaithfulness,
   while men of less talent and learning but more zeal and faith, and
   consequently more efficient, were either kept out of the conferences,
   or crowded out on to the frontiers. He also found that some of these,
   both in the ministry and the laity, like the one just described, seemed
   to conspire against genuine Methodism. He saw that Asbury, Bramwell,
   Abbott and Nelson would not be tolerated by such ministers. He saw the
   lives of these worthies on sale at the book rooms, and sometimes
   peddled among the membership of the church by these ministers who took
   pains to hold up to ridicule those who strove to walk the same way.
   This caused him seasons of great depression of spirits. At these times
   he would be greatly tempted to give up the battle. Sometimes, he would
   conclude that he had looked on the dark side so much, that he might be
   deceived as to the real state of things.

   Just at this time Sister Phoebe Palmer informed him of a brother in
   Western New York who felt the same as he did, and was engaged in the
   same kind of work. He determined to find this brother and by his aid
   settle the question that troubled him. It was also made known to him
   that this strange brother desired his attendance at a camp meeting
   about to be held, and he needed no urging to accept the invitation, and
   in due time was on his way to the place.

   Speaking of his visit to the camp meeting and of his introduction to
   the man he wished to meet, Mr. Redfield says:

   "I was full of conjectures as to the appearance and spirit of the man I
   was about to meet. I knew some Congregationalists and Presbyterians who
   were welcoming the doctrine and experience of holiness as it had been
   taught by the early Methodists; but to see a living Methodist who saw,
   felt, and labored, as I saw, felt and labored, was to be to me a treat
   indeed. On reaching the campground, Sister Palmer introduced him to me.
   He was very cautious, but courteous and hearty in his deportment. The
   next moment he was gone, I knew not where. I soon heard a voice leading
   a holiness meeting, to which I drew near and listened for some time,
   and finally said to myself, "I am not alone in my peculiar views of
   holiness." I drew nearer, where I could see as well as hear, and found
   the speaker to be the very man whom I had come so far to see -- Fay H.
   Purdy.

   Referring to this meeting, Mr. Redfield continues: "I went into the
   stand one day between services, and found my friend in conversation
   with a pale, sickly-appearing man, who was confessing to him, with deep
   emotion, that he had wronged him. The sick man said: "I expect to die;
   I want to die in peace with all men. I have tried to injure your
   influence, and now I ask your pardon." This was readily granted; and
   soon after I took my friend aside and said to him: "My brother, that
   confession is worth something, but I think you should never let it be
   known; let it die with you." But how greatly was I shocked to see in
   the public prints a short time after, a more severe criticism on my
   friend from this same man than he had ever given before.

   "This man included Sister Palmer and myself in these criticisms. I made
   no attempt to reply to him, and he soon dropped me. But Sister Palmer,
   or some one for her, returned the fire, and a newspaper war upon the
   subject of holiness here began, which to my knowledge was a prime cause
   of awful backsliding. I found places in my labors where confessions
   were made of this stamp:

   "So many years ago I enjoyed the blessing of holiness; but when I saw
   in one of our Methodist papers articles against the doctrine of
   holiness, I first was shocked, and then began to reason: if ministers,
   who ought to know more than I do, say the doctrine is untrue, it may be
   I am mistaken. And giving up the doctrine, I soon lost the experience."
   One of these owned up that it brought him to the gutter.

   "Some of the preachers who encouraged the sickly man I have described,
   a few years after were glad to get rid of him."

   From this camp meeting Mr. Redfield went to another, and there found
   that the sickly minister, whose confession he had heard, had so
   cautioned the presiding elder, who was in charge, against him, that he
   was not allowed to labor much.

   From here he went to Peekskill, where forty or fifty were converted in
   a few days.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 30

   From Peekskill Mr. Redfield went, on invitation of the chaplain, to
   visit the Marine Hospital of New York city. Not knowing his
   congregation, he committed himself to the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
   He was led to treat them with all the kindness he could command. The
   main drift of his preaching was to offer hope, and they would break
   down and cry like whipped children. Many were clearly converted, and
   some of them died soon after in the triumphs of the Christian faith. He
   staid but a short time, and after he was gone, some of them entreated
   the matron to send for him, "for," they said, "nobody understands us as
   he does. The ministers who come here think we are a hard set and preach
   to us of hell; and that don't do us any good, for we are used to that;
   but when one preaches to us kindly, that breaks us all down."

   When Mr. Redfield heard this he made inquiries in regard to these
   brokenhearted mariners who had come here to die, and found that many of
   them had served terms in the state's prison; and, when discharged had
   changed their names and enlisted in the United States service. This
   made a deep impression upon him, and taught him that these men were not
   hypocrites; that the terrors of the law do such no good for they are
   already in a hopeless state of mind. Hope only can reach them.

   He went from here to the Sing Sing state's prison by invitation of the
   chaplain of that institution. Here he followed what he believed were
   the leadings of the Holy Spirit, and preached to the prisoners in the
   same manner that he did to the sailors in the hospital. He says: "I
   could not see that they were different from the mass of mankind. These
   had been caught, the others had not. I felt drawn to address their
   better nature; if possible to arouse it to respond to the truth and the
   call of God. I told them God condemned men when the decision is made to
   commit sin; while man condemned for the action only. I tried to show
   them that each had redeeming traits, and that they might, if they
   would, by the grace of God, rise to a life that would be acceptable in
   the world to come. That though men might look upon them as degraded and
   lost, yet they were capable of bearing the image of God. To men they
   might appear criminal., but with God all men are criminals. What if men
   do brand you with names of dishonor and disgrace, and chisel those
   names in the monuments of human remembrance; and what if you die
   unhonored and are buried in yonder prison graveyard, and no stone to
   mark the spot? if you will avail yourselves of the means God has
   provided, your names shall be written in the Lamb's book of life, and
   angels shall keep watch over your sleeping dust, and in the morning of
   the resurrection you shall come forth to be honored by the King of
   kings.

   "I did not attempt to apologize for their sin, or to soften the color
   of their crimes, but tried to refer the question of the difference
   between them and the rest of mankind to the judgment day, the proper
   place for the settlement of the question. I told them that it was
   honoring themselves to say to the Almighty, "Against thee and thee only
   have I sinned."

   "The magical effect of kind words addressed to their hopes was
   wonderful to behold: the dropping tear, the anxious look, with now and
   then a flash of gratitude, as they gazed upon a poor mortal like
   themselves, who instead of upbraiding them was endeavoring to induce
   them to try once more to rise to true manhood, and to aspire to the
   society of heaven.

   "The next day as I passed through the prison, I thought I experienced
   some of the emotions of the Angel of Mercy. I was allowed to converse
   with some of the prisoners, and found some of them penitent, and quite
   a number of them genuinely converted to God. I was astonished to see
   the depravity and entire alienation from God of some. Some awakened
   ones desired me to step one side that they might talk freely to me. One
   among them, who had been sentenced for ten years, who had already
   served out five, and had given his heart to Christ, now with tears
   running down his cheeks, confessed that his sentence was just; and that
   God in mercy had allowed him to come to that place for his own good. He
   said he had not a relative or a friend to come to him in his disgrace,
   and yet he was so happy and so contented that he could not bear the
   thought of leaving the place lest the snares of the world should entrap
   him again. He said, "When I go to my cell and sit down on my bunk,
   Jesus comes and sits with me, and we have such sweet communion that I
   would rather stay here than lose it."

   "The warden told me that there were some prisoners so violent that they
   had to be kept with a ball and chain fastened to their ankles. They had
   once taken a stand in one of the cells, in defiance of the authority of
   the prison, refusing to obey orders.

   "I asked if I might see them. The warden answered, "I don't know
   whether it is safe." I pleaded, "Just give me permission to go to
   them." This was finally granted, and I went in and sat down among them
   without any manifestation of fear, and trusted myself to them. In the
   spirit of kindness I conversed with them. They claimed they had been
   greatly abused. But I appealed to their sense of right and wrong; that
   it was their duty to do right whether others did or not. My kindness of
   manner and speech, and my treating them as though they were reasonable
   beings touched them, and soon they consented to change their course and
   submit to the discipline of the prison.

   "I found one man, a foreigner, who from not understanding our laws, had
   committed an offense in an effort to show kindness to one apparently in
   distress, and had received a sentence of five years at hard labor. The
   warden was greatly interested in his case, and was desirous that some
   one should make an effort to obtain a pardon for him. I undertook it
   with the assistance of another gentleman. It was necessary to get at
   all the facts in his case so as to lay them before the governor of the
   state. In order to have access to the man for this purpose, I was
   obliged to hire him of the state; and to meet the expenses, it was
   necessary to furnish him with employment. The only employment at hand
   that the man was fitted for required a second man, and one more skilled
   than he. The second man was a genius in his way. He was serving out his
   fifth sentence. He was very ambitious to excel, and loved to be
   appreciated, and withal very affable and agreeable. But he seemed to
   have a passion for stealing. The first man told me I must be on my
   guard or he would pick my pockets. He also told me that the man kept an
   old bag in a by-place in which he hid bits of coal and bits of cloth
   clipped from prison garments brought to him to be mended. In regard to
   the first of the two men, the effort to obtain a pardon succeeded, and
   he went forth a free man.

   "While engaged in the effort to procure this pardon, I saw several
   instances of the fidelity of woman's love in the face of disgrace
   brought upon the family. Wives came to visit their husbands who were
   prisoners, but though there were several married women in the prison,
   there was not a single instance of a husband coming to visit his wife
   during all the time I was there."

   During his stay at Sing Sing he held a series of meetings in the town.
   As usual, the doctrine and experience of holiness was made a prominent
   feature. There was much opposition, but victory was won for God and his
   truth, and many were saved.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 31

   About this time the preacher from Bridgeport, Connecticut, came to Mr.
   Redfield and invited him to assist him in revival services at that
   place. He said:

   "We must have a revival or lose our church. Our people have been robbed
   for years of the fruit of their labors by the proselytizing system of
   other churches; and they at last came to the conclusion to build a
   church which would overtop all others, and thus gain a position in the
   community which would command respect. But now we must lose it, for we
   are owing twelve thousand dollars, and we cannot raise that amount. You
   must come and help us."

   Mr. Redfield replied, "I am sorry your people have been trying to win a
   name by worldly policy. I dread to meet the spirit which such a state
   of things is sure to foster. My experience has taught me that such a
   state of things is against the faithful preaching of the doctrine and
   experience of holiness."

   The preacher acknowledged the mistake of the people, but said, "We have
   it and can't afford to throw it away. What can we do? Must we give it
   up and let Methodism be driven out of the place? Or shall we try to
   save it?"

   Mr. Redfield finally said, "I will go;" but it was with a heavy heart.
   He knew God would hold him responsible for the faithful presentation of
   the truth and thorough dealing with men. He was almost certain that he
   would meet with great opposition. Referring to the state of things at
   this place, he says:

   "When I arrived I saw a stately edifice, eclipsing all others in
   exterior splendor. Two great towers, one bearing a bell and the other a
   clock, reared their massive proportions in front; the whole of antique
   architecture and "loud" appearance. My heart ached in view of the
   prospect. I thought, "This course will destroy the last vestige of real
   Methodism, unless God come to the rescue." I could see none among the
   ministry who dared to risk their chances of preferment by attempting to
   stem the tide. But somebody must fearlessly take sides with God, and he
   will possibly be crushed for his pains. I thought I comprehended the
   situation; I realized my own weakness; but I resolved in the name of
   God and pure religion to do my duty. When I had done so, I felt a
   strengthening of my soul, and the sweet assurance that God approved of
   the vow."

   In his preaching, from the commencement, he endeavored to arraign the
   conscience before God. At the close of the first service the pastor, on
   the way home, asked if a less objectionable class of truths could not
   be used. Mr. Redfield replied: "Do you think Jesus would mutilate the
   truth, and tacitly give men to think that he had preached the whole?
   and this when he had not touched the real evil of the case?"

   "Well," said he, "I am afraid your course will ruin us."

   "Brother," said Mr. Redfield, "what time does the next train leave
   here?"

   "Why, you must not leave?"

   "O my brother," said Mr. Redfield, "I certainly shall leave if I cannot
   go the Bible track. I will allow you to call me to account at any time
   when you find me outside the Bible and the Methodist discipline, but I
   insist be free to preach the whole truth."

   "Well," said he, "you must stay, and we must have a revival or lose our
   church."

   "I feel no interest in your saving your church in the present condition
   of things. It would be no calamity to religion to lose it, unless it
   can better represent Methodism than it does at present."

   Said the preacher, "You must stay; and do be as easy with us as you
   can."

   Mr. Redfield replied, "I'll be as easy as God will let me, but no more
   so; and I wonder that any one can ask me to lower the standard of the
   only religion that can save!"

   Mr. Redfield went on with his work in the name of God and truth. In one
   of the afternoon meetings Fay H. Purdy, who was assisting him, fell to
   the floor while Mr. Redfield was praying. This was something new to the
   congregation, and unexpected to the minister. [2] The husband of one of
   the members, a man who paid well, but was without salvation, arose,
   apparently in great anger, and left the house. At this the preacher
   became alarmed. After a little, one sister arose and began to confess
   to dancing, playing cards, novel reading, and conformity to the world.
   The preacher became very uneasy, and finally arose and cautioned the
   people against looking on the dark side, and referred them to the old
   prophet who complained that he only was left to serve God; and how God
   corrected him with the assurance that there were seven thousand in the
   land who had not bowed the knee to Baal.

   Mr. Redfield saw the tendency of this was bad, and arising, said: "That
   is all true in the case of the old prophet; but I insist that if these
   members have been dancing, card-playing, novel-reading, and behaving in
   general as the followers of the meek and lowly Jesus ought not, it is
   due to him and the truth and the world that they confess their sins as
   publicly as they have committed them. It is only thus they can restore
   themselves to the confidence of the world as the representatives of the
   religion of Jesus. The cause of Jesus has been slandered by their
   conduct; and is in disrepute because of it. Common honesty demands that
   the wrong should be charged where it belongs. If Jesus has not
   disgraced his own cause, do not compel him to bear the odium that now
   rests upon it. If they have done this thing, it is the honorable way
   for them to say to the world that neither Jesus nor his gospel is at
   fault."

   The Lord soon began to manifest himself in great power in the
   conviction, conversion, and sanctification of souls. When victory began
   to seem certain, the other churches began to accuse Mr. Redfield of
   bigotry, because he had not invited them to participate in the
   meetings. His experience in other places enabled him to perceive the
   motive that underlay this, and that was their desire to gather the
   converts into their own churches. He also saw that it would not do
   arbitrarily to rule them out, and that it would be for the good of all
   concerned if they, like the Methodists, should become as thoroughly
   reformed. He then gave them an invitation to unite in the work, but at
   the same time insisted that they should humble themselves before the
   Lord, and that as many of them as had been addicted to dancing, and
   card playing, etc., should make the same confessions the Methodists
   had. He told them they would have to do this if they ever regained the
   confidence of the community, and were in a condition to assist in the
   work. This had a salutary effect. It removed the objection which had
   been made, and put the responsibility of their non-affiliation where it
   belonged.

   One of the ministers still stood out upon the technical objection that
   he had not been invited in writing. But his motive was so apparent that
   his attitude was no hindrance to the work. He was the one above all
   others who had despised the Methodists, and yet had labored the hardest
   to gather their converts into his church.

   The skeptical portion of the community now put forth an effort to check
   the work by disturbing the services, and the strong arm of the law had
   to be invoked to stop their proceedings. The same persons then
   attempted to accomplish their purpose by petty annoyances beneath the
   notice of the law. To meet this, one Sunday evening at the opening of
   the service, Mr. Redfield told the Christians present not to fear the
   opposition, for victory was as certain as that God was the author of
   the gospel. God might allow these annoyances and persecutions for a
   while, but if they were likely seriously to hinder the work, he would
   take life if necessary to stop them. He then related a number of
   instances of this character which had come under his own observation.
   The next day, at dinner, in a house opposite the church, a daughter of
   the family residing there, aroused the company by relating what Mr.
   Redfield said, and characterized it as an attempt to frighten the
   people, and said, "I would like to know who will be the first to be
   knocked down in this place for ridiculing religion. Let us try it!" She
   then began clapping her hands, and shouting, "Glory, glory, glory," and
   instantly fell to the floor in great agony. Word went out that she was
   dead, and was smitten down while ridiculing religion. An eyewitness of
   the scene related it in a large boarding house, where were a number who
   had been engaged in a similar manner, and who were now greatly shocked
   at what they heard. All opposition of this kind now ceased and the
   revival went forward with increased power. In a few weeks over five
   hundred were converted.

   The young girl who was so suddenly stricken down lay four or five days
   in that condition, and then was restored, but with a permanently
   impaired mind.

   As Mr. Redfield was about to go to another place, the minister in
   B_____ said, "Before you go you must take the converts into the
   church." It was arranged for this to be done the following Sunday. At
   the close of the sermon in the morning, Mr. Redfield requested all who
   desired to unite with the church, to come forward and be seated in the
   front pews. A large number came, when he addressed them as follows:

   "It is your duty to unite with some church. You need to be under its
   watch-care. I do not ask you to join the Methodists, nor do we want you
   unless you are in every essential point a Methodist. I do not know as
   one here desires to join the Methodists, but if there should be, I will
   tell you what we shall expect of you. We desire no one to come among us
   who will engage in proselytizing from other churches. We shall expect
   you to live up to our rules. (Here he read the General Rules of the
   Discipline, commenting on them as he passed along.) You perceive from
   these, there can be on your part no more dancing, nor card-playing, nor
   novel-reading, nor pleasure parties, nor wearing of jewelry, nor
   worldly conformity. This may seem hard to you, but there are other
   churches that are not so strict as this, where you will be welcome. You
   will only be a curse to us by your example and influence if you do not
   conform to our rules. Some of you know how faithfully we have had to
   deal with some here during these meetings, who have lived contrary to
   these rules. And I would say, if there are any still among us who are
   not in sympathy with our rules, and have not determined to obey them,
   you had better do so immediately, or take your letters and go where
   things are more to your mind." (Here the preacher became very uneasy,
   and Mr. Redfield expected to be called to order, but he was allowed to
   proceed.)

   "I have now told you only what you cannot do and be a Methodist. I will
   now tell you what you must do to be a Methodist. We shall expect of you
   a faithful attendance upon all the means of grace; class and prayer
   meetings, the preaching services, and family religion. We shall expect
   you to be active in seeking the conversion of sinners, by personal
   labor for them and with them. You will be expected to make religion the
   first business of your lives. All worldly matters are to be considered
   but the small chores of life. If you cannot make this pledge to us,
   that you will conform to these rules, you had better go where it will
   not be required of you. If you go elsewhere to have the privilege of a
   life of inactivity in the cause of Christ, and of doing as you please
   in loving the world and conforming to it, you will come, by and by, to
   death, how soon none can tell; it may be a year; a month; a week; and
   you will open your eyes to see that you have exerted an influence,
   which is still in operation, that turns immortal souls out of the way
   to heaven and into the way to ruin. Now pass on to the judgment and see
   how it will appear there. Behold the souls over which your influence
   preponderated, like the grain of sand which turns the scale, and fixed
   their destiny forever among the lost. On the other hand, if you choose
   to join where all these things are required of you, which you perceive
   are in harmony with the word of God, your influence will be felt, and
   will tell on the side of salvation. If your probation in this life
   should be long or short, in death you may pillow your head on the bosom
   of Jesus, and leave behind you an influence in the Christian activity
   of those whom you helped to decide aright, that shall work on through
   the ages while you are sleeping in the dust; and in the great day of
   God there shall stand among the redeemed the blessed fruit of your
   decision, to rejoice with you forever."

   Both the church and the preacher, if Mr. Redfield rightly interpreted
   the indications, were in great fear as to the results of this address.
   But when he asked those who wished to do so, to give their names to the
   church, more than one hundred responded; and in a few days some four
   hundred more did the same. And what was peculiar, not a single one
   united with any other denomination. Soon after this, the debt that hung
   over their church property was paid, and a second church had to be
   built to accommodate the congregation. This demonstrated that faithful
   work makes good Methodists.

   About this time Mr. Redfield met with the following anecdote which gave
   him much encouragement:

   "When Elijah Hedding who afterwards became bishop, was stationed in or
   near Boston, a servant girl of the celebrated Hancock family, was a
   member of his church. One Sunday she took home from the church library
   a volume of Wesley's sermons. Soon after the lady of the house picked
   it up and after reading in it for some time, called the girl and asked
   where the book came from. The girl informed her, and added, "Our
   minister preaches just like that every Sunday." The lady inquired his
   name, his street and number, and then ordered her carriage and drove to
   his house. Mr. Hedding himself answered the bell, and she asked, "Is
   this the house of Rev. Mr. Hedding?'

   "That is my name," he replied, and invited her in. When they were
   seated, she said,

   "I have come to talk with you about joining your church."

   "Mr. Hedding looked at her in surprise, at her attire, at her carriage
   before the door, and concluded there must be some mistake in the
   matter. He asked: "To what circumstance am I indebted for this call?'

   "She then related to him the incident of the volume of sermons, and the
   remark of the servant girl, and then added: "Those so fully accord with
   my views of what a Christian life should be that I hasten to identify
   myself with the people who hold to those views."

   "But, madam,". said Mr. Hedding, "do you know our discipline, and can
   you conform to our rules?'

   "He then opened the book and read them to her, and repeated the
   question.

   "She replied promptly: "I can, and will."

   "Still desirous of dealing faithfully with her, and to get rid of her
   if she was not willing to be a Methodist indeed, he said: "Madam, you
   are a stranger to me, but as we are to have a love-feast next Sunday
   morning, you had better come to that; and in the meantime I will
   consult with my official brethren, and, if there is no objection, I
   will receive you on probation."

   "She came to the love-feast, was received into the church, and became a
   worthy Methodist."

CHAPTER 32

   Towards the close of the meetings at Bridgeport, several Methodists
   from New Haven visited the services, and were desirous that Mr.
   Redfield should come to their place. But little did they know of the
   conflict which preceded the victory they had witnessed. Soon an
   invitation came for him to spend a season there. As usual with Mr.
   Redfield, he underwent a season of great spiritual suffering before he
   gave his answer. The first question for him to settle was, always: "Is
   it God's will?" Then came his natural shrinking from the conflict that
   awaited him. He had heard enough of the state of the church in that
   place to know that the struggle would be a hard one. Past experience
   had taught him that his spiritual conflicts would be great, and
   attended with great suffering. He knew, too, if the opposition
   prevailed, the attempt would work against him in the future. The tide
   of worldliness had now set in so strongly, and had become so general,
   that wherever he went the battle must first be fought out in the
   church. And it was no light matter to attempt to bring a dead church
   into that spiritual state where it would be a successful working power
   for God and souls. He had learned that the tendency of worldly policy
   in the church was to benumb the conscience and blind the perceptions of
   the membership and ministry to the spiritual truths touching
   consecration and holy living, and that it would take a greater degree
   of divine power to awaken them than to awaken the ungodly. He had also
   learned that the carnal reasonings and fears of a worldly church and
   ministry were more serious obstacles to scriptural awakening than the
   combined opposition of all forces outside the church. It was because of
   this that he suffered so in spirit. Yet he reasoned: "Somebody must do
   the work. Whoever enters upon it, must lay every interest upon the
   altar of God -- reputation, the good opinions of friends, all outlook
   for the future; and with a single eye to the truth and the glory of
   God, stand for the exact right, and take whatever comes as best he can.
   It may as well be me as any one. If I go down in the conflict, my
   calamity may draw the attention of some honest and daring one who,
   following God fully, may finally triumph."

   Reader, would you call this cowardice? True bravery does not shut its
   eyes to the dangers that surround it, and then go forward blindly. He
   is the bravest man who is most conscious of the danger and still goes
   forward. Some natures less finely strung than Mr. Redfield's would have
   gone forward easily and readily, but their work would have been more
   crudely and less thoroughly done.

   After a full consideration of the matter, Mr. Redfield consented to go,
   and informed the messenger who had come for his final answer, that he
   would be in New Haven the next Thursday night.

   New Haven was the seat of Yale College. The influence of this
   institution was hostile to Methodism, and had been from the beginning.
   It was a city of many churches, and these likewise all hostile to
   Methodism. At this particular time there was no manifestation of
   opposition, for Methodism had ceased to be a power in the city. The
   membership had cowered before the lofty claims to superiority of these
   churches, and had contentedly settled down in a subordinate position
   and almost ceased to have an independent life.

   The time came for Mr. Redfield to take the cars, but it was with the
   feeling of a soldier going into battle, and not that of one who has
   gained the victory. He went with the determination to do his full duty
   if he was not allowed to hold more than one service. When he arrived he
   found a number of brethren waiting at the depot for him with a carriage
   to take him to his boarding place. He felt grateful for this, yet he
   saw that it would make the cross heavier to do his duty to them when
   the time came for it. He found that a great effort had been made to
   advertise the meetings, and by the manner in which this had been done,
   much curiosity had been excited to see and hear him.

   When he entered the church he found a large congregation present. At
   the proper time the pastor arose and said: "Brother Redfield has
   finally come, and will preach tonight, tomorrow and next-day night,"
   and then sat down. Mr. Redfield arose, and addressed them somewhat as
   follows:

   "It may be so, and it may not. You may not desire me to stay after
   tonight. But, by the help of God, I mean so to preach that if I am
   called to the judgment within five minutes after I am through, I shall
   be ready. And it makes no difference to me whether I stay one day or
   six weeks, I shall certainly preach the straight judgment truth of God,
   the same truth we must die by, and be judged by, -- if it takes the
   last brick from the foundations of this church."

   With his usual unction and power, he endeavored to define the type of
   religion which was necessary to enable a soul to enter the kingdom of
   God.

   The mass of the membership was frightened, and with it the pastor. But
   one good old man, who knew what primitive Methodism was, came and took
   him by the hand, and bade him Godspeed.

   One of the leaders came and said: "You have altogether mistaken this
   people. That kind of preaching will not take in this place. You have
   tacitly reflected upon the other denominations in this city, and we
   believe they are pious people."

   An ex-mayor of the city somewhat relieved the feelings of the pastor by
   saying to him: "That is the kind of preaching we need in this city. We
   have not a minister here who dares to risk his reputation to preach
   like that. That is the reason why the churches have been so inefficient
   for the last twenty-five years. Here, give him that, as a token of my
   approval," and handed him a twenty dollar gold piece.

   Before the pastor got away from the church a lawyer met him, and said:
   "That is the kind of truth we want here."

   Soon after, several more of the influential men gave their sanction to
   the truths Mr. Redfield presented, which greatly allayed the minister's
   fears.

   In a few days the rabble began to serenade Mr. Redfield with doggerel
   [trivial] songs, to send him ball tickets through the post office, to
   hoot and shout after him in the street, to hold mock prayer-meetings
   and to mimic his voice and manner. The careful were greatly distressed
   at this, and came to him with the matter, but he rejoiced, as he saw in
   it the evidence that Satan was being disturbed. He told them, "The
   devil will soon exhaust his resources, and we'll see many of these made
   happy in God."

   For seven or eight weeks he preached wholly to the church. At last he
   was waited upon by several members of the official board, who told him
   that his course would ruin the church, if not soon changed. They also
   informed him that they knew of more than fifty persons who were waiting
   for an opportunity to present themselves as seekers, and they were
   afraid this perpetual labor for the church would soon become stale and
   offensive to them. One of them said, "There are many of us, and I am
   one of them, who will never get out clear until we get to laboring for
   sinners."

   Mr. Redfield replied: "I know of many who desire to become Christians,
   but I tell them we are not ready for them yet. Now, brother, the
   trouble with you is, you desire to get on the wrong side of the altar.
   You can't warm up by the exercise and call that a revival."

   "But what will become of sinners if we spend all our time praying for
   ourselves?" he asked.

   Mr. Redfield replied by asking, "What will your prayer be worth for
   them if they do yourself no good? It would be better to ask the
   penitents to pray for the church."

   He saw, however, that nothing but a failure would convince them, and
   the next evening he gave an invitation for penitents to come to the
   altar. Before they were through singing the first verse of an
   invitation hymn, the altar was filled. He then invited the brethren
   forward to pray for them. A large number of them came. The first
   brother who prayed asked for the blessing of God on the missionary and
   the Bible cause, and almost everything else but the seekers at the
   altar. Others followed in like manner.

   Mr. Redfield then arose, and said: "It is time to close, but if any of
   these penitents have been blessed, let them confess it to the people."
   He tried to encourage them to do so, but it was in vain. He then said
   to the congregation: "I will never again while I am here ask penitents
   to come to the altar for the benefit of such dead, meaningless and
   formal prayers. We will keep to work at ourselves until we get so we
   can pray."

   The next night the very ones who had been so anxious to warm up by
   praying for others, began in good earnest to pray for themselves. One
   or two received such a view of their own hearts and lives that they
   appeared to be in despair. He now appointed two meetings to be held
   about an hour before preaching, in two of the classrooms, for the
   benefit of those who desired to seek perfect love.

   In a few days God gave a few witnesses to the experience. The number of
   witnesses then began to increase faster and faster, until soon their
   aggregate power moved the entire city. Frequently there were more than
   one hundred at the altar at one time seeking for pardon. Other churches
   now availed themselves of the opportunity, and reaped great benefit
   from the general awakening. In one of these churches it was reported
   there were received above four hundred persons. The revival got into
   Yale College, and many of the students were converted. All hostility in
   other denominations, for the time being ceased, except the
   proselytizing to gain members.

   A good deacon came to Mr. Redfield, and told him that one minister was
   preaching to his congregation that it made no difference how people
   lived, or conformed to the world in dress and manners, if only the
   heart was kept right. Mr. Redfield felt it his duty to say publicly in
   regard to this, that God's requirements were unbending; that his word
   commanded them to "love not the world," and to "be not conformed to the
   world." He warned the congregation against ministers who taught the
   contrary. He urged that all men must settle these questions with God
   alone, and the Bible was to be their guide. As a result of his faithful
   dealing, one woman laid aside several hundred dollars worth of jewelry,
   and went from house to house confessing the wrong of her fashionable
   life. She then tried to undo the bad influence of her worldly life upon
   her own family, and in two weeks had the pleasure of seeing each member
   of it converted to God.

   Another woman saw her husband, who was considered a model Christian, in
   such agony over his own state, that his cries aroused the whole block
   in which he lived. She then cried out, "If my husband sees himself in
   such a light, O Lord, where am I?" She sought the Lord now in the most
   earnest manner, and when she found him, so great was the blessing of
   God that she could not rise from her bed, and remained thus for more
   than one week. When Christian people came to see her, with her face all
   radiant with the glory of God, and with great power she declared, that
   she saw the church did not believe the Bible.

   Such experiences had a powerful influence in the community, and in a
   few weeks from the time that the work broke out more than fifteen
   hundred had been gathered into the kingdom of God. The Methodist church
   in which this meeting was held, was so filled with members that more
   than thirty families were unable to find seats, and another church had
   to be built in another part of the city. Yet, strange to say, the
   pastor afterward became an opposer of Mr. Redfield and spoke
   disparagingly of this revival.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 33

   While work was moving in great power in New Haven, a deputation from
   Stamford waited upon Mr. Redfield and invited him to that city. He
   accepted the invitation, and, immediately after closing his work at New
   Haven, repaired to that place. On being introduced to the pastor, the
   following conversation took place:

   "How many inhabitants have you here?"

   "About eighteen thousand."

   "How many churches?"

   "Eight or ten. Our own people have three, but one is closed."

   "What is the prevailing tone of religion?"

   "Unitarianism."

   "How long since the Methodists had anything like a revival?"

   "About thirty years. But we have become quite respectable. The time was
   when we could not get a spot in the place on which to build a church,
   and we had to build some miles outside the town. A great change has
   come over Doctor O_____, who so bitterly opposed us then, and now he
   says we ought to have the same privileges the other churches have. Now
   we have this fine edifice in, an eligible part of the city."

   Mr. Redfield said nothing, but he feared that this respectability had
   been gained by abandoning real Methodism.

   In due time he proceeded to the church for the first service. The
   message was to the church; the theme -- the New Testament standard of
   religion, and the unlawfulness of all others. The meeting closed, and
   he returned with the pastor to the parsonage. As soon as they were
   seated, Mr. Redfield was asked:

   "Is that the course you design to pursue?

   "Yes, sir."

   "I do not think it will do here. I think I can give you some valuable
   advice if you are willing to receive it."

   "Very good; good advice is always acceptable. Tell me just what you
   think."

   "Well, I think our conference preachers have done admirably here for
   many years. Brother_____, who was here years ago was a perfect
   gentleman, and the people all loved him. Brother_____, who followed
   him, took the same course; and so all of them down to the present time.
   These men won their way into the affections of the people, and have
   gained for us the position we occupy now."

   "Then you think that is the course for me to pursue?"

   "I do."

   "Will you tell me what time the next train leaves?"

   "You do not think of leaving, do you? We have sent for you to hold
   these meetings, and we want a revival."

   "Brother," said Mr. Redfield, "God has made me a rough man, and given
   me a rough gospel for rough hearts. I shall leave; for if you think a
   little more of the same stuff which you have had is necessary, and
   which you acknowledge has been a failure for thirty years, you have all
   the tools necessary, and have no need of me. I will go where the people
   will allow me to use God's only tools for saving men."

   After some moments of silence, he replied: "Well, my time is nearly
   out, as this is near the close of my last year; and I will allow you to
   go on."

   Two days after, in an afternoon meeting, an old man, a member of the
   church, arose and said: "I went home from meeting last night, and went
   to bed, but I could not sleep. I thought I was sick, and would die
   before morning, and I dared not sleep. I arose and knelt down and tried
   to pray. I struggled the remainder of the night, but about the break of
   day God spoke peace to my soul." And then raising his voice very loud
   he cried: "My brethren, this is the same kind we used to have thirty
   years ago." Then arose a sister, who said: "Brethren, when I heard what
   a great revival was in progress in New Haven, where Brother Redfield
   was laboring, I thought, "If he will only come here, what a good time
   we would have." But when he came, and began to preach, I said: "O Lord,
   I can't have it come this way." I thought he would put it on to the
   sinners, but when he preached so sharp to us, I thought "I never can
   endure it." But last night, when I went home I could not go to bed, so
   I sat up all night and prayed God to have mercy on my soul. And early
   this morning he came in power to me. Oh, this is the same kind we used
   to have years ago!" and she fell, as though dead, to the floor.

   Another and another arose, and gave in substantially the same
   testimony. Dr. O_____, who had come to the meeting, evidently out of
   curiosity, by this time had become quite angry, and now arose and left
   the house. As he passed out he said to one: "Such things ought not to
   be tolerated; and Mr. Redfield ought to be shut up at once."

   The meetings went on in great power for several weeks, and many were
   saved.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 34

   After his labors in Stamford, Mr. Redfield visited the camp meeting at
   _____, and there saw such an illustration of the power of divine grace
   to save as he had never witnessed before. It was the case of a man who
   had become so abandoned that several times he had been a candidate for
   the penitentiary. To all appearance, his mind was but a wreck. He was a
   fish peddler, but when he could find any one who would gamble with him,
   he would leave his fish to decay in his cart. So wretched and vile had
   he become that some thought it was useless to pray for him. Some months
   after this, Mr. Redfield saw him again, and the change in him seemed
   like that in the demoniac of Gadara, when Jesus had cast out the evil
   spirit. His body was still a ruin; his mind, stupid; his person,
   filthy; and his whole external appearance, very repulsive; yet when he
   spoke of his experience there was such a charm in his artless testimony
   as gave a most vivid illustration of the power of grace to overcome the
   devil.

   At this same camp meeting he met with an Indian preacher whose
   religious experience was very marked. In relating it he said:

   "I was powerfully awakened. I sought to get help from the white man. I
   heard of a camp meeting and thought, "I'll get help there;" I went to
   the place, but seemed to get no help. I was uneasy and wandered from
   place to place about the grounds. I went from tent to tent, looked into
   them, and seeing nothing to help me, turned away. I was most wretched.
   Finally the meeting closed; the last tent was struck; the last wagon
   driven from the ground, and I was yet unsaved. Night came on. I walked
   into a little ravine, the bed of which was dry, and laid down on the
   grass, determined never to rise until I found peace. During the night
   it began to rain, and after awhile the water began to run down the
   ravine. It came up around my sides, and then ran over me. I raised my
   head so I would not drown. At last, when it seemed as though I would
   drown if I staid there longer, God blessed me, and I crawled out of the
   water and went on my way.

   While at this meeting he also became acquainted with another Indian,
   the son of a chief, who told of the great concern he felt for his
   people, and how God had used him in bringing his relatives to God. He
   related the following story:

   "I procured a Testament printed in the Chippewa language. Having found
   Jesus myself, I wanted to see my red brother enjoying the same. I asked
   him to go out into the woods with me. We took our seats on a log. I
   then read to him about the death of Jesus. I read on and on, when at
   last he laid his hand on me and said, "Just stop there." I stopped, and
   he started to leave me. I knew from his looks what he meant, and
   neither spoke nor followed him, but remained sitting on the log. He
   went over a little knoll and began to pray in good earnest. He
   continued to cry for mercy until the sun was going down, when suddenly
   he bounded to his feet like a deer. God had saved him. He now started
   for his father's wigwam, and going in, knelt down and began to pray.
   Soon his mother came and knelt by his side, and then a sister, and then
   another; and finally his father came and knelt down. By the morning all
   were converted. His father was so happy over his new religion, and so
   anxious to spread it, that he started for the store of the white man
   who sold fire-water (whisky) to the tribe. When he got there, he said
   to the white man:

   "We have lived together here for a long time. We have been good
   friends, and never had a quarrel."

   "That is true," said the white man.

   "Now, I want you to do me one good thing as a friend. You know I never
   asked you for anything before."

   "Well, I'll grant you the favor if I can; what is it?" asked the white
   man.

   "Then," said the Indian, "Don't sell any more fire-water to the
   Indians. You know many of them have come here and bought the
   fire-water, and some of them when drunk have tried to cross the river
   and have been drowned; and some of them have fallen in the snow and
   have frozen to death. And our people have been made wretched by
   drinking the fire-water."

   "The white man made the promise, and the old Indian returned home to
   pray for him. The next morning he went near enough to see that the
   store was closed, and then went back to pray for the white man more;
   and to let him have time to think it over. The next morning he went
   again to see, and found the store still closed. The third morning he
   found the store was still closed; but he went now to see how the white
   man got along. He found him in despair. He tried to comfort him, but he
   said: "No! no! it is true; I've been the means of the deaths of those
   who were drowned, and of those who were frozen, and there can be no
   mercy for me."

   "The old Indian tried to think of something that would give the poor
   man hope, and finally said: "There must be hope for you, for the Lord
   had mercy on me. If he can save an Indian, he can save a white man."

   "The poor man laid hold on this, and was saved. He then went among the
   Indians and became a successful missionary among them."

   At another camp meeting during this season, Mr. Redfield met a
   converted Jew in whom he became greatly interested. He was a son of a
   rabbi. He told Mr. Redfield the following story of his father's death,
   as an illustration of how Christ comes to some of his people in the
   dying hour. When his father was drawing near to death, and while
   uttering the usual cry of his people at such times, "he called for me,"
   said the son, "and said to me, "O my son, I have tried to live in good
   conscience all my life. I have tried honestly to serve the God of my
   fathers; but now in my great extremity I do not feel prepared to die. I
   have done everything I can think of to prepare me to meet God, except
   to have a sacrifice offered for me. But that is impossible; we have no
   temple and no high priest." Some of our Jewish friends came as usual at
   such times, and exhorted him, as a last act of fidelity to God, to
   curse Christ, and thus deny all fellowship with idolatry. But he broke
   out saying: "God forbid that I should deny my only hope of salvation."

   "This," said the young man, "is of frequent occurrence among the more
   devoted Jews."

   This incident afforded Mr. Redfield much comfort, for the thought of
   missionary work among the Jews, and how to do it, had been much upon
   his mind.

   During the summer, while visiting in Stamford, as he passed a house one
   day a lady called him in to see her husband who was in despair over the
   doctrine of election. He had, in childhood, been taught the Calvinistic
   faith, and although he had been a Methodist for years, he could not
   shake off entirely that teaching.

   Mr. Redfield asked him, "How long have you been in this state of mind?"

   "For twenty years," he replied. His wife said he would sometimes shut
   himself up in a room and pray and groan for hours together without any
   relief.

   Mr. Redfield said to him, "Tell me as near as you can all about it."

   "Oh," said he, "I am afraid that I am a reprobate; that Christ never
   died for me. Sometimes I feel my heart a little softened, so I can weep
   a little; and then I take comfort and hope that I am not lost. But the
   hardness returns, and then I am in distress again."

   "Well said Mr. Redfield, "I am not going to use any arguments against
   that false doctrine; but I want you in your heart to say, I believe
   Jesus died for me."

   "Oh," said he, "I would not dare to do so wicked a thing, for if he did
   not die for me, I should then be believing a lie."

   "Never mind that," said Mr. Redfield, "for if Christ did not die for
   you, according to this miserable doctrine, you are lost any way, and to
   believe one more lie cannot make your case a great deal worse; you had
   better risk it."

   The old man repeated aloud, in measured tones, "I believe that Jesus
   died for ME. Oh, glory to God! I've got it! I've got it! I've got it."

   Here Mr. Redfield saw demonstrated that one act of faith would do what
   twenty years of praying had failed to do.

   In another place, that season, he attended a holiness meeting held in a
   private house, where a room overhead was occupied by a gentleman
   boarder, whose strange conduct is recorded below. God graciously
   manifested himself in the meeting and several were sanctified, and a
   number more converted. In the midst of it, the man overhead began to
   rave like a madman. He came down into the hall, and began to howl and
   bark and growl like a dog, and that so rapidly and violently that it
   sounded as though a number of dogs were fighting there. He then burst
   in the door, and when he saw Mr. Redfield, his eyes flashed, and he
   moved towards him as if to do him harm, and yet harmed him not. At last
   he left the room. The next day the man of the house asked him why he
   could disturb a religious meeting like that.

   "Sir," said he, "I do not wish to do such things, but I cannot help it.
   I know that I am forever lost; I have known this for years. Ever since
   the time when I was forsaken of God, I cannot endure the sound of
   prayer or of religious song. It completely unmans me."

CHAPTER 35

   As winter approached Mr. Redfield was invited to return to Stamford to
   one of the forsaken churches in that place. The condition of Methodism
   in the vicinity may be seen from the following facts. Three miles away
   was a church which had not been occupied for three years; one and
   a-half miles away was one to be closed the following spring; two miles
   in another direction was one that had been unoccupied for many years.

   The pastor who had invited Mr. Redfield was a devoted man, but poorly
   adapted to resurrect a dead church. Under the strong truths preached by
   Mr. Redfield a general awakening was coining on, when other Methodist
   societies in the vicinity opposed to the resuscitation of this one,
   forced the meetings to close. The African Methodists then opened their
   doors, and the revival went to them. Here God wrought mightily, and
   some of the most wealthy and influential people of the city came to the
   altar and were saved; some of them that the deadness which had reigned
   in the churches had well nigh made infidels. Among themselves they
   started a subscription to build a new church, and desired Mr. Redfield
   to become their pastor. He consulted his presiding elder, who advised
   against it, and the matter was dropped.

   He was now having all the calls he could fill; and to have accepted
   that proposition would have turned him aside from his peculiar mission.
   He had many friends among the more spiritual of the ministry, who would
   have called in question the propriety of such a step; and the step once
   taken, might have involved him in circumstances such as would have
   rendered it impossible to retrace it.

   Before leaving Stamford, he went with the pastor to hold one more
   service in the old church that had been closed so long. During the
   service he observed a young man in the congregation who seemed deeply
   interested and who closely watched everything that was said and done.
   When the invitation was given for seekers of sanctification, he came
   forward boldly. He was a Methodist preacher, and after the service
   closed he invited Mr. Redfield to go to his charge five miles away to
   labor with him for a season. He said the church was not inclined to
   receive him when he was appointed the spring previous; but after
   pleading with them for some time, they yielded, and let him stay. He
   now desired Mr. Redfield to go with him to assist in a revival meeting.
   The following conversation then passed between them.

   "Now will you go?" said the young preacher.

   "Do you believe in the doctrine of sanctification as held by the
   Methodists?" inquired Mr. Redfield.

   "I do," was the ready answer.

   "Do you enjoy it?" asked Mr. Redfield.

   "I do not," the preacher answered.

   "Will you seek it with all your heart until you find it?" further
   inquired Mr. Redfield.

   "I will," was the immediate reply.

   "But let me tell you what may be the consequences of your taking this
   stand," said Mr. Redfield. "If you obtain this experience and preach
   it, you will have a living, active church, and sinners will be
   converted in great numbers. They will be converted so they will know it
   in power. Then perhaps when conference comes, some one else will be
   appointed to the charge. And the membership and converts may
   injudiciously speak in great love of yourself as their former pastor;
   and if the new preacher has not the grace to endure it, he may become
   jealous, and will speak lightly of you to the other preachers; and by
   impressing the conference that you are an unsafe man, and poorly
   calculated to keep up the dignity of Methodism, as a result you may
   find yourself crowded out of the best paying appointments, and on to
   frontier work. Now, if you thus lose caste and standing among the
   preachers, and have to go on alone, unappreciated, will you seek for
   this experience, and preach it to your people? Can you afford to wait
   for the great day of judgment to adjust all these matters?"

   With great emphasis, the young preacher replied, "I will accept the
   conditions."

   "Very good," said Mr. Redfield, "I will go to your place: and further,
   if ever you get into a hard spot, because you take the honorable course
   for God, just let me know, and I will come to your help."

   Mr. Redfield went to the aid of this young preacher, and found the
   utmost freedom "to go the straight way for God and the exact right." At
   the close of the first sermon, the young minister took his stand as he
   had promised. He said:

   "It may seem strange to my congregation that I have never preached this
   doctrine to you. But as an honest man I could not preach to you what I
   did not enjoy as an experience. When I joined the conference, I told
   the bishop and the preachers that I believed in this doctrine, and
   would seek it. And now, ask you to forgive me for not having done it
   before; and I also ask you to come forward and pray for me."

   He then knelt at the altar, and the members of his church around him.
   The power of God fell upon them in a wonderful manner. The work of God
   began with unusual power, and soon the entire community was deeply
   moved. Skeptics, who had not entered a church for twenty years, were
   convicted, until unable to leave their homes.

   The place of worship stood on a corner where five streets came
   together, and was the scene of glorious things. Sometimes the saved, as
   they returned to their homes, made the night air ring with their
   shouts.

   This young minister, soon after, thought it best to take a transfer to
   a Western conference. We will not consider his case further at present,
   but shall hear from him again.

   Mr. Redfield was now called to go to the aid of a conference preacher
   who had made himself offensive by his plainness. He had been appointed
   to a village that could boast of, a tavern, two churches, one
   blacksmith shop, and four or five painted houses. But the people
   rebelled at the "imposition," as they called it, of having a preacher
   appointed to them, who was so far behind the times as to be opposed to
   worldly amusements. Mr. Redfield staid but a few days, as he could not
   discern that he would have any especial help from God in the work.

   A short time after he went to a camp meeting in Central New York. There
   he found strong opposition to the doctrine of holiness among the
   preachers. This was very painful to him, and aroused his fears for the
   future of the doctrine and the church. One preacher, in a sermon,
   opposed the doctrine as taught by the early Methodists. In the midst of
   his argument against it, one of the preachers in the stand quoted two
   or three passages from the Bible that upheld the doctrine, but was told
   by the presiding elder to "stop"; yet, this elder had no rebuke for the
   man who was antagonizing Wesley, Clarke, Watson, and other standard
   authors in the church. This sermon threw the people into great
   confusion, and many of them left the congregation, thinking to strike
   their tents and go home. Mr. Redfield and others went to them and
   endeavored to dissuade them from this, while the elder, seeing the
   disaster the sermon was bringing upon the meeting, required the
   minister to stop. Rev. Hiram Mattison, who at this time was the leader
   of this opposition to the doctrine of holiness, was present, and
   attempted to allay the excitement by speaking somewhat as follows:

   "The doctrine of sanctification is true and good. There are various
   opinions in regard to some of the details of it. I can best express
   mine by using an illustration: On an orange tree you will find blossoms
   and green fruit and ripe fruit. My experience is similar to that. When
   I was converted I was partially sanctified. When I joined the church I
   was a little more sanctified. When I took a license to preach I was
   still a little more sanctified. And so you see we are more and more
   sanctified as we pass along; and the way to become sanctified is to
   progress in the divine life."

   He said much more, but this was the substance of it all. This made the
   matter no better with the dissatisfied brethren. Brother Purdy was
   present, and in his inimitable manner tried his hand upon the storm. He
   prepared a place for a prayer meeting in an unoccupied part of the
   ground and called the people together. He then said: "I think it will
   be well to take the testimony of the people upon this question. Now,
   how many of this company know, by a heartfelt experience, that entire
   sanctification is distinct from justification and regeneration, and
   that it is received instantaneously by faith? Arise and stand upon your
   feet." About three hundred arose. "Now," said he, "let all those who
   know they have experienced it, but received it gradually, and not
   instantaneously." Not one arose.

   This was thought by the opposition to be a very unfair proceeding; and
   yet they saw nothing wrong in staying in the church and openly opposing
   one of its fundamental doctrines.

   The following are some of Mr. Redfield's reflections in regard to the
   matter:

   I could but think, when a preacher, in a place like this, will be
   allowed to attack one of the fundamental doctrines of the church, and
   receive encouragement from the presiding elder, we are in a very bad
   state. Methodism must come to an end, or another people be raised up to
   carry on the work. But I shall probably be numbered with the dead when
   that day arrives. God helping, I will do all I can to save what
   spirituality remains, to check the waning of its power, and to keep it
   as efficient as possible while I live."

   These circumstances led him to see the necessity of a greater degree of
   spiritual power than he had ever known, that he might be more efficient
   in the Master's service.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 36

   At the close of the camp meeting mentioned in the last chapter, Mr.
   Redfield went to Syracuse, N. Y., in company with a Brother Hicks and
   wife. While tarrying there for a few days, he attended a prayer meeting
   with them at the church where they belonged. On leaving the church
   there came to him his old sign which had always tokened to him a great
   outpouring of the Spirit. He said to Brother Hicks, "I tell you God is
   going to visit this city in awful and glorious power."

   "Yes," said Brother Hicks, "I believe it. A goodly number of us have
   been praying for it, and we feel that he has answered our prayers; and
   now we are looking for it."

   These friends were desirous that Mr. Redfield should come and lead a
   revival meeting, but were fearful that their pastor would be unwilling,
   as he had not manifested any sympathy with the doctrine of holiness.
   Mr. Redfield had never before received this peculiar token of a revival
   except when he was to be an active laborer in it; and as yet there was
   no indication that he would be connected with this. So without waiting
   further he started for his home in New York city. But before a great
   while he received a letter from a preacher stationed at Salina, now a
   suburb of Syracuse, requesting his services. He accepted the call as a
   possible step towards Syracuse.

   On his way while traveling up the Hudson river on a night boat, he
   began to have a wonderful manifestation. The especial impression was of
   the presence of the heavenly host; and its effect was to comfort, cheer
   and strengthen him. This lasted all through the journey. He seemed rapt
   in a contemplation of God, and the work of God, such as no words could
   express.

   As he approached Syracuse, there came to him again the same token of
   the coming revival. He reached the city, and went to the house of
   Brother Hicks. Here he took courage again, for this man could
   appreciate the strongest type of salvation. His house was like the
   temple of God, where the altar fires were constantly burning. It was a
   sanctuary for the oppressed and the persecuted. For years one could not
   enter it often without finding there some one who had made it a refuge.
   Seasons of prayer there often lasted all night, and sometimes
   complaints of this were made to the magistrates.

   Brother Hicks took Mr. Redfield to the home of the minister he was to
   assist; and on crossing the bridge that lies between the two towns, the
   old token appeared again, but this time, it stood over the place to
   which he was going. When he reached the minister's house, he found him
   in very poor health. The state of religion was such, that because of a
   small amount of indebtedness on the church property it was about to be
   sold. The society had about concluded to dismiss their preacher,
   because of the lack of funds to pay him. There could be no possible
   objections to Mr. Redfield's labors in such a place. For some time he
   had found that ministers were perfectly willing that he should work in
   such places, and that with the greatest freedom, for he could not
   possibly make things any worse.

   He also found that this place had been overrun with mesmerism,
   spiritism, and finally unionism; that is, the discarding of all
   denominational distinctions. The next step was to Unitarianism.

   There was a fear upon the part of good people that if a revival should
   take on the old-fashioned type that characterized early Methodism, it
   would be called spiritism, or mesmerism, or something else besides real
   religion. His reply to them was, "I believe that the old gospel has as
   much power today as it ever had, and that God will come to our rescue;
   and if men try to imitate the work, as in the days of Moses, the rod of
   Jehovah will swallow up their rods, and they will be obliged to confess
   the true God."

   The revival had not been in progress long before a good woman from
   another town felt constrained to come to see Mr. Redfield. She came to
   the house where he was stopping, was introduced, and when about to
   shake hands, she gave two piercing screams, so sudden as to startle
   him. He had never heard anything like them before, and knew not what to
   make of them. He thought it best to wait until he had an opportunity to
   investigate them before he allowed himself to be disturbed with them.
   When meeting time came he started for the church, and this woman with
   some friends followed. Occasionally he would hear her give the same two
   peculiar screams as they came along the walk. When he had reached the
   pulpit and turned about, he saw her coming in at the door, holding her
   hands over her mouth. She came up near the pulpit, and as she turned to
   enter a pew she gave the same two screams again, so loud as to shock
   all in the house, and then clapped her hands over her face and appeared
   greatly mortified; but, evidently, could not control her voice.

   In a subsequent conversation with her upon the subject, she told him
   the history of this strange phenomenon. She said, "Once while
   conversing with an honorable gentleman, a member of the Methodist
   Church, he complimented me upon the quiet and unostentatious character
   of my piety. I replied, "It is a source of gratification to me that I
   am not as demonstrative as some." Instantly a power seized me that I
   could not resist, and I uttered those two screams. Since then I have
   found it in vain to resist when that power is upon me."

   As soon as Mr. Redfield could get the attention of the congregation, he
   began the service. But often during the evening she gave those two
   peculiar screams. The curiosity of the people was aroused to know what
   it could mean; yet when the invitation was given for seekers of
   holiness, the altar was crowded with them. The prayer meeting began,
   and in a few minutes a seeker at the altar screamed in like manner; and
   then another, and another. Finally, one woman's scream was entirely
   different from the rest. It sounded as you would imagine a woman would
   scream if a knife was suddenly and unexpectedly thrust through her
   heart. A sister of hers came, took hold of her, and shook her,
   commanding her to stop; but it was all in vain. Some six or eight were
   exercised in that manner during the altar service.

   In the midst of this, Mr. Purdy, who was assisting in the meeting,
   asked, -

   "Don't you think you had better check it?"

   "I do not yet. If God makes the duty plain I will; but not till then."

   "Well, what do you make of it?"

   "I don't know. But I shall not wonder if God is preparing to meet and
   overcome the magicians in this town. You perceive no one can possibly
   make such a sound of themselves. Besides, there is no fear of
   hypocrites attempting it, for it is too humiliating."

   The service closed, and Mr. Redfield returned to his boarding place.

   The sister of the lady of the house was stopping there also, and she
   was one of those who had been so strangely exercised. Mr. Redfield now
   thought he would have a good opportunity to study the phenomena. This
   woman was about thirty years of age, and married. She, as well as all
   the rest of those so exercised, was of good report and good standing in
   society. Before retiring for the night the entire company knelt in
   prayer. She commenced those screams again, and continued them for about
   five minutes with a rapidity that he believed no one could imitate.
   After rising from prayer, all retired for the night. In the morning Mr.
   Redfield had an opportunity to talk with her in regard to the exercises
   of the evening before. She appeared very solemn when she came into the
   room, and immediately, in a subdued tone of voice, and in humbleness of
   manner, asked him:

   "Can you tell me what this means? When I went to bed last night it all
   stopped, but commenced again when I arose this morning. You know what a
   spell I had at family prayer last night. Well, I thought I saw my dead
   sister who passed away triumphantly a few years ago. I also seemed to
   see my father's house, and my mother very sick; and that they want me
   to come home."

   Her sister, the lady of the house, then came into the room, and asked,
   "What do you make of this?"

   He replied: "I cannot tell; and yet my opinion is, that it is something
   God has sent, or permitted, to put cavilers to silence."

   "Do you think it would be right for me to pray the Lord to stop it?"
   she asked.

   "I do not, sister. My impression is, that you should not court it, nor
   fight it. Let it alone; seek only to be right with God, and if it is
   allowed to come, then there is an object it will serve. Let it come, or
   go, upon you."

   "Oh, I would not have it come upon me for ten thousand worlds."

   With a scream, her sister replied, "It will come upon you."'

   At that she began to tremble, and sat down. She was holding a wash bowl
   and pitcher in her hands, and so violently was she shaken that Mr.
   Redfield feared they would be broken, and he took them from her. At
   this, with a shriek louder than any he had yet heard, she was thrown
   upon the floor, and then, as if seized by a giant power, she was lifted
   up and taken into another room. This was attended with those screams,
   or rather those movements attended the screams, for the screams came
   first. After a little she was able to converse.

   "Well, what do you think now?" asked Mr. Redfield.

   "Oh," said she, "I would not have the in taken from me for ten thousand
   worlds."

   "Are you in pain when you scream?"

   "I was at first, but soon it was the joy that filled me. It was beyond
   anything I ever dreamed could be this side of heaven."

   "Is it because you feel such joy that you put forth an effort to
   scream; that is, is the scream the result of your effort?"

   "Oh, no! I put forth no effort at all. But a power seems to take hold
   of me, and I am compelled to scream. I cannot resist it."

   Of all the other cases which he examined, and there were a large number
   of them, some of screaming, some of jumping, and others of a kind of
   dancing, in every case they testified the same; that is, it was
   produced by an unseen power, unexplainable by them, that took hold of
   them, and over which they had no control. In one case, the woman prayed
   that it might leave, and it did leave; but she was instantly in an
   agony of despair, and found no rest until she prayed for its return.
   Another had a similar experience.

   In the case of the first one he examined, who seemed to have the vision
   of her father's house and the sickness of her mother, in a few hours
   after her statement to Mr. Redfield, she received a letter by mail, in
   which the foregoing was corroborated.

   Whatever the reader may think of these incidents, if candid, he must
   admit the wisdom of Mr. Redfield's advice: "They are not to be courted,
   or fought." Since that day there has been much of such demonstrations.
   Some of the best of Christians, persons of clear understanding, and of
   pure lives, have had them. It is also true, that many of inconsistent,
   and in some cases of impure lives, have had them.

   Usually where there has been extreme encouragement of them, it has
   resulted in mischief. The same may be said where there has been
   determined opposition to them. Those who have neither courted nor
   fought them have got along with them the best. It has been
   demonstrated, -- beyond all doubt, in the minds of the observing, --
   that they are not infallible marks of piety. Another thing is also
   true, -- as yet mankind knows but little of mental science, and
   probably many of the strange phenomena of mental operation are yet to
   be explained.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 37

   When Mr. Redfield began his work at Salina, as usual he tried the best
   he was able to set forth the standard of holiness in view of having
   "something to work up to," as he expressed it. He pressed the people to
   seek this experience. Many came forward for that purpose, but were
   unsuccessful in seeking it. He then made the discovery, after careful
   examination, that the mass of them were backslidden from God. So he
   publicly confessed his mistake in preaching holiness to them, when they
   needed justification. He then attempted to impress the truths related
   to that phase of religious experience. But again they were brought to a
   stand. More thorough searching, and humbling themselves before God, and
   it was discovered that the mass of the people in the religious
   confusion that had reigned, had fallen below even morality. So he
   confessed his mistake again, and began preaching to them the first
   principles of the kingdom of God.

   He now began to have some of his own peculiar experiences again, that
   had often attended his most successful efforts. He began to be
   "burdened" for the work. He had often had these struggles, and
   sometimes with a severity that threw him upon his bed as if with a fit
   of sickness, and held him there until victory came. One night in the
   church he was filled with unspeakable agony for souls. If h could have
   howled like the old prophets, it would have relieved him; but this he
   could not do. He thought he could not endure it. He attempted to go out
   of the church, but was checked by the Holy Spirit. He then said, "Lord,
   I'll try to hold on." He then began to cry out, "O my God, this people
   must be saved." At this he was instantly relieved. The whole church was
   now in commotion. Screams for mercy mingled with shouts of rejoicing
   were heard on every side. At this time commenced the strange
   demonstrations described in the preceding chapter.

   When the revival was fully under motion, and these demonstrations were
   becoming common, then the curious began to come to witness the strange
   sights. One night several came near the altar and asked permission to
   observe them closely. It was given them, and soon they began to make
   remarks as follows:

   "It is nothing but hysterics."

   "Do you understand physiology?" asked Mr. Redfield.

   "Yes, well enough to know this is nothing but hysterics."

   "Are people usually happy when they have hysterics?"

   They did not answer.

   Another said: "It's nothing but psychology."

   Another said: "It's spiritualism."

   Another said: "It is easy enough to produce it all."

   Mr. Redfield was afterwards told that some of these men held meetings
   in which they tried to imitate these phenomena, but failed. They then
   declared it to be supernatural. Many of these men were soon after
   converted to God.

   The experience of a Unitarian woman well illustrates the thoroughness
   of Mr. Redfield's methods. She was of high standing in the community
   because of her wealth and benevolence. In years past she had been an
   active member of an orthodox church, and none had been more deeply
   engaged in revival work than she. Of late she had pretended not to
   believe in anything of that kind. God now got hold of her by his truth.
   When she came forward some of the more worldly of the Methodists seemed
   much elated. The expression on their faces seemed to say, "Now, she
   will give our church character, and we'll be thought something of." Mr.
   Redfield thought he detected this, and resolved that she should go
   through it if it was possible. He knelt near her and asked her loud
   enough for all to hear it, "Madam, what is your wish in coming to the
   altar?"

   "I want religion."

   "Then pray right out loud for salvation."

   "Oh," said she, "I cannot pray for myself."

   "Well, then, I cannot pray for you."

   "Why, I have said I would go to hell before I'd ever pray in such a
   place as this."

   Raising his voice, he repeated her words, and then said, "Madam, you
   will either take that back, or you will go to hell. You need not think
   of succeeding in your rebellion against God."

   "Do you think there is any mercy for me?" she inquired.

   "I don't know," he replied, "your case is a hard one, and it maybe you
   have already passed beyond the limits of mercy; but I would try to
   pray."

   "Well, I'll try."

   "But will you pray in your family?"

   "Oh," said she, "I have said I'd sooner be damned than pray before my
   husband."

   "Well," said he, "you'll take that back, or be lost forever."

   "Well, I will," she replied.

   "But you have exerted an influence against God and Christ among the
   Unitarians; now will you go to them and confess this, and cut your
   acquaintance with them, and tell them why you do it?"

   This was a hard task, but after being shown that her course had been
   one of hostility to God and the right, and if she desired to make clean
   work, she must now do this, at last, she said,

   "I will do it."

   "One thing more. Will you exhort them to seek Jesus, and then pray with
   them before you leave them?"

   Some may think this was carrying the matter too far, and she felt it
   was a hard thing for her to do. But Mr. Redfield thought it a wicked
   thing for a woman in high position to use her influence against Jesus
   of Nazareth, so he insisted upon her making the thing right with God
   and man.

   "Well, I will," said she, at last.

   She then turned and asked one to pray for her, of whom she had said, "I
   never want him to pray for me." The moment she made this request she
   fell helpless to the floor. She was truly saved, and did her duty
   faithfully, and God was with her in power.

   One of the Unitarian ministers came to him one day for a talk. After a
   formal introduction, he said:

   "I am happy to make your acquaintance. I have attended some of your
   meetings, and I desire to say to you, that I extend to you the right
   hand of fellowship. But I think you might adopt one suggestion I will
   make, and that to your advantage."

   "What is that, sir?" inquired Mr. Redfield.

   "Let us win our way to the hearts of sinners by showing Christian love
   among ourselves. Just let them see how our religion unites us all
   together, and this will recommend the benign religion of our Saviour."

   "But how far would you have me go with this?" asked Mr. Redfield.

   "All who even take the name of Christian, are entitled to our charity
   and brotherly love."

   "But suppose a man tells me there is no more virtue in the blood of
   Jesus than in the blood of a hog?" (This had been preached in this
   man's pulpit, unrebuked.)

   "Well, it will do no good to hold a man off and deny him your charity
   for opinion's sake."

   "Further" said Mr. Redfield, "suppose he tells me he does not believe
   in God, nor heaven, nor hell, nor Christ, nor a future state

   "Well, it is a free country, and any one has a right to believe what he
   pleases; and we can do no good to a man by prescribing what he shall
   believe as a condition to his receiving our charity."

   At this Mr. Redfield said: "Let us pray," and kneeling down, prayed for
   his visitor as a poor, deluded man.

   At the afternoon service this man was present. After a time he arose
   and said:

   "I desire to say here, to this church, that I feel a great interest in
   these meetings. They meet with my hearty approval."

   When he sat down, Mr. Redfield arose, and said: "I want this
   congregation to understand that, as a church, we have no fellowship
   with infidels or atheists. And I know this man to be such from
   conversation with him today. God calls upon us and angels, to worship
   Christ, -- to worship Jesus."

   Instantly the power of God seemed to fill the whole house.

   These services continued a short time longer. The church edifice was
   saved, the debt paid off, the minister received back for another year,
   and well provided for; there was a large addition to the membership, a
   good parsonage built, a second church built near by to accommodate the
   congregation, and that all paid for, and the whole within a few months,
   as the fruit of this revival meeting.

CHAPTER 38

   Mr. Redfield now went back to the city of Syracuse to see if he could
   find an opportunity to labor there. He went to the house of Brother
   Hicks, and sent for the preacher in charge. When he arrived, Mr.
   Redfield immediately stated his reasons for sending for him.

   He said: "For the first time in my experience, I ask for an opportunity
   to come here and hold a revival meeting. I am a Methodist; and I have
   had a wonderful experience with regard to this matter; and I am sure
   God has designs of great mercy for this city; and from my feelings, I
   think he designs that I shall be identified with it. Now, I desire to
   know if you will allow me to hold a meeting in your church?"

   "Oh," said he, "if God designs you to hold a meeting in this place he
   will open the way for you."

   "But will you allow me to hold a meeting in your church?"

   "It will cost too much for expenses."

   "I have anticipated that objection, and I have brought money enough
   with me to pay expenses for a few months; and I will labor free of
   charge if you will allow me to come into your church and hold a
   meeting."

   "Well, you cannot be allowed to come into my church."

   "Then, brother, you will not feel afflicted if a way should open in
   some other denomination for me to labor here."

   "Of course not," he replied, with an expression on his face that
   indicated his doubts of that ever coming to pass.

   The next mail brought to Mr. Redfield a request to come to Palmyra, the
   home of his friend, Fay H. Purdy, to hold a meeting. In response to
   this, he took the cars for that place. As he drew near, his old sign of
   coming victory made its appearance again. He had no knowledge of the
   place, not even its exact location. When he arrived at the station
   where he was to leave the cars, he found himself about nine miles away,
   and that the public conveyance was a stage. While waiting, a gentleman
   approached him with the question: "Will a ride in a private conveyance,
   at the same price, be agreeable?"

   "Yes, sir; and much preferable," Mr. Redfield replied.

   As soon as he was seated, and on the way, the following conversation
   took place:

   "Do you live in Palmyra?" asked Mr. Redfield.

   "Yes, sir."

   "Do you know a man by the name of Purdy?"

   "Yes, sir."

   "What of him? I hear a great many things about him. What is he?"

   "Oh, the man is in bad repute among the people where "he is best
   known."

   "He is a Methodist, and labors in revival meetings I believe?" remarked
   Mr. Redfield.

   "Yes; but the people here have no confidence in him."

   "He is, probably, a man who swears?" said Mr. Redfield, inquiringly.

   "Oh, no; I don't think anybody would accuse him of that,"

   "Well, he probably lies?" Mr. Redfield continued.

   "Oh, no; not that either."

   "Well, he must be a great cheat, -- a dishonest man said Mr. Redfield,
   in the same inquiring tone.

   "Oh, no."

   "Well, what is it?" he then asked.

   "I will tell you," said the man. "I am a Methodist, but it is the
   world's people who find fault with him."

   "Well, what is it they have against him?"

   "The world says, "If he is so zealous for religion, why doesn't he stay
   at home where his work is needed?"

   "You have a new preacher since conference, I believe?"

   "Yes, sir."

   "Well, how do you like him?"

   Oh, not at all."

   "What is the matter with him?"

   "Why, he is too old, and he does not keep himself tidy. He is no honor
   to Methodism."

   Said Mr. Redfield, sternly, "I know what the trouble is with you; you
   are all backslidden from God. I am going to the house of Brother
   Purdy."

   When he arrived and had a proper opportunity, he asked Brother Purdy,
   "What is the matter with your new preacher?"

   "Well, I will tell you. He is a good man, but our church is backslidden
   and formal, and they think he is not up with the times. We have not had
   a revival in sixteen years. In spirituality the Congregationalists have
   far outstripped us. They have revivals, but we do not. Our church has
   been mortgaged, and the mortgage foreclosed, and it is to be sold in a
   short time. Spiritual worship "has been turned out of doors, and an
   organ has been put into the gallery to make up the deficiency, and to
   pander to the tastes of the world. The preacher was not received, and
   the elder has been denounced as a "pope," because he will not remove
   him. The dandy preacher who was here before him, wore his gold
   spectacles, and carried a gold-headed cane, and acted the fop, and now
   the contrast is too great for them to abide. They have not paid the new
   preacher a cent, and say they will not. So I have given him a shelter,
   and am supplying his wants."

   Mr. Redfield now understood the state of affairs, and looked to God for
   direction and help.

   He was now taken to the house that was to be his home during his stay.
   He had scarcely got to the room assigned him, when a Brother B_____ was
   brought in and introduced to him. Mr. Redfield found him to be a good
   man, who lived some seven miles away, and had come to spend the Sabbath
   in the meetings.

   The next morning Mr. Redfield arose early, and went down the stairs.
   Soon he heard Brother B_____ groaning loudly in the room adjoining, and
   a glance through the window revealed a large number of people standing
   on the walk who had been attracted by the noise. Mr. Redfield asked the
   family, "What does this all mean?"

   "Oh," said one, "it is Brother B_____ at his devotions."

   "What kind of a man and Christian is he?"

   "Oh, he is one of the very best of men. Everybody knows Brother B_____
   to be an excellent Christian."

   The preacher in charge was to preach that morning, and Mr. Redfield did
   not go to the church until time for the sermon. As he entered the
   church he heard quite a commotion in the basement; and on reaching the
   pulpit, the old minister said: "We have been having awful times down
   stairs this morning!"

   "What is the matter?" asked Mr. Redfield.

   "Oh, Brother B_____ fell to the floor, and made so much fuss that he
   scared the people till they ran out of the house. My wife is very angry
   about it. Hark! hear Brother B_____"

   And there came up from the basement a cry of anguish, and the words: "O
   God! I shall die if this church is not saved!"

   Said the preacher: "I think I had better go and lock him in a
   class-room."

   "Brother," said Mr. Redfield, "let him alone. The Spirit that would
   interfere with him, would drag Christ from the Garden of Gethsemane."

   "But I am afraid he will come upstairs!"

   "Well, let him come."

   "But he makes such an awful noise!"

   "Well, you need an awful noise. If you get salvation enough, you'll get
   where you will be able to hear a hallelujah without fainting away."

   "There he comes" said the preacher.

   "Well, let him come."

   And sure enough he did come, and crying out in great agony as he came.
   As he reached the altar he fell to the floor, and Mr. Purdy cried out,
   "Amen!" at the top of his voice. One of the old members who sat near by
   asked in an angry voice, "What did you say amen for?"

   "Because I'm glad to see God get one more chance to breathe in this
   church."

   "Well," said the preacher, "I will go and put him into a pew."

   He did so, but soon Brother B_____ rolled off onto the floor, and made
   more noise than ever.

   The old minister tried to preach, but the struggles and cries of
   Brother B_____ made it almost impossible for him to do so. When the
   sermon was ended, Mr. Redfield took occasion to endorse Brother B_____;
   and seeing the preacher was in great distress of mind over it, he
   thought it best to go home with him. When they arrived at the house
   they found one of the lady members almost in hysterics over the matter.
   The preacher tried to soothe her, but Mr. Redfield said to him, "Don't
   smooth over the matter; she is fighting against God." After a little
   she began to confess that she was not right. The preacher now declared
   his intention to send Brother B_____ home the next day.

   "Well, said Mr. Redfield, "then I'll go, too."

   "Oh, you must not go. We must have a revival or lose our church."

   "I don't care about your church. It would be no calamity to lose it,"
   replied Mr. Redfield. "They have managed to keep God out for sixteen
   years, and it is now ruled by the spirit of the world. The members are
   on the road to hell, and will get there if they don't repent."

   "But they will not pay me a cent of my claim, and want to drive me off;
   and I am dependent on Brother Purdy for shelter and for the necessaries
   of life; and the church is to be sold in a few weeks."

   "Let it go; it's a curse in its present condition."

   "Well, don't leave us, and I'll let him stay."

   "But, brother, there is another item I want in the conditions, and that
   is, if you believe that brother to be a good man, you must give him the
   right hand of fellowship. If you do not, you'll have two parties in
   your church over this very matter. The people saw this morning that you
   were greatly tried with the good brother, and unless you settle the
   matter at once you will have sympathizers with you. Now, by prompt
   action on your part you can stop all that."

   "Well," said he, "don't leave, and I'll do it."

   "Very well; do it tonight when I am through preaching."

   When the time came he stood tip in the altar and confessed to the
   congregation, and to Brother B_____, how he had been tried, and turning
   to Brother B_____, said, "Brother B_____, I give you the right hand of
   fellowship, come into the altar;" and instantly he dropped to the
   floor. As soon as he could command himself, he said, "If I had given
   way to my feelings I should have made a great deal more noise than
   Brother B_____ did this morning. I have not had such a blessing in
   twenty-three years."

   Now began the war. One infidel, a merchant, who paid ten dollars a year
   for a seat in the church, and did the same thing for a seat in another
   church, in great wrath arose and left the church. His wife pulled out
   the cushion and started after him; both declaring they would never have
   anything more to do with the Methodist Church. But this only created
   the more stir, and curiosity brought the people out from near and from
   far. The house became so crowded that it was necessary to have services
   both in the basement and in the upper room at the same time. One night
   there were thirty conversions, and more than five hundred were
   converted in a few weeks. The preacher was taken into favor and
   provided for, the liabilities against the property paid; and Methodism
   took hold anew in that community.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 39

   Mr. Redfield now received a letter from the Congregational society of
   Syracuse, inviting him to hold a revival meeting in their church. He
   obeyed the call at once. When he arrived at Syracuse he went
   immediately to one of the deacons of the society to talk over the
   matter. He asked:

   "Is it true that your church wishes me, a Methodist, to hold a
   protracted meeting?"

   "Yes, sir," said the deacon, "we passed such a resolution."

   He then took Mr. Redfield to see one of the other deacons, who
   corroborated the statement of the first.

   "Well, deacon, how long since you had a revival in this city?"

   "Oh, we had a kind of a stir about fifteen years ago, but nothing to
   amount to much in twenty-five years."

   "Have you put forth any effort?"

   "Oh, yes; we have had Finney, and Lovering and Knapp, but nothing
   scarcely was accomplished. There are now five churches in the city
   without pastors, and the place is given over to the Unitarians."

   "Well, deacon, had you not better put that question to vote over again,
   that you may do this thing with your eyes open? I am sure the old
   gospel is as potent as ever. I can do nothing, but that can. You must
   prepare yourselves for a great conflict, and many things that will
   shock all your ideas of order and propriety. I will tell you what I'll
   do: if any fighting or setting the church on fire takes place, I will
   do all I can to regulate that; but if God comes, -- and that he will in
   awful power, -- and the people shout or lose their strength, or
   anything else that God owns by working in the midst of it, you must not
   interfere."

   One deacon said, "I have taken my stand, and I have no back tracks to
   make."

   The other said, "The devil has had full swing for fifteen years,
   without let or hindrance, and I think it no more than right that God
   should be allowed to have one chance more."

   "Very good," said Mr. Red field, "I will go forward.

   He then went to see a Methodist preacher who lived not far away, and
   asked him to assist in the work, but he declined on account of poor
   health; but he felt there was no use of asking the one who had refused
   to allow him to work in his church, and who had so sneeringly said he
   had no objections to Mr. Redfield laboring in the city with other
   denominations. Yet this minister was soon active in circulating the
   report that Mr. Redfield was making war on Methodism.

   Mr. Redfield had preached but a few times, when in one of the afternoon
   meetings, one deacon arose and vehemently protested against the
   Congregational church being used to make the people confess.

   Mr. Redfield replied, that he had been invited with the understanding
   that he should not be trammeled in his measures; that he labored for
   nothing, and other churches were calling for him, and that he had no
   time to spend in contention. He then said, "I want to know if I am to
   be allowed to go forward or not." A vote was taken which resulted in
   his favor, and the deacon was quieted. The meetings went on a few days
   more, and the deacon could endure it no longer; and he became very
   bitter and violent in his remarks. Again the vote was taken and again
   the deacon was voted down. In a few days more he arose in a meeting all
   broken in spirit, and made a most startling confession to the church
   and congregation.

   The Spirit was now being poured out in great power. Two Presbyterian
   elders fell under the power one night. While they lay there a deacon
   approached Mr. Redfield and said, "You Methodists get greatly excited."

   Mr. Redfield replied, "Do you know that man crying over there?" "No!"
   "Well, that is a Presbyterian elder."

   "What! can that be possible?" he asked.

   "Yes, sir;" said Mr. Redfield, "and you all have Methodist hearts, and
   if you would give God a chance at you, he would do the same things with
   you."

   Among the confessions made was one by a young lady, who said, "I have
   been a member of the Methodist Church for ten years, but have been
   deceived all this time. I never knew until now what religion was. But I
   know it now."

   A Unitarian lady, who came to the meetings, she said, to prevent a
   friend of hers from going forward, when returning home the same night,
   fell while passing the Unitarian church, and cried out in great agony
   for mercy. Several persons who heard her, guided to her through the
   darkness by her voice, went to her assistance. The first words she
   spoke to them were, "Can any of you pray?" They took her to her own
   home, and one of them who had a religious friend, went for that friend
   to come and pray, but the friend was backslidden from God, and was
   obliged to become a seeker first, before he could aid her; and both
   were saved that night.

   So great was the religious interest, and the danger to the Unitarians,
   that they sent to Boston for Theodore Parker to preach in their church
   for a season. He came, and flaming handbills were posted through the
   city announcing his arrival, and the themes of his discourses. But a
   violent storm which swept over the city a few days after he came so
   damaged their church that he returned to Boston.

   Some of the fruit of this revival still remains. In after years, in the
   West, Mr. Redfield was welcomed and cheered by the faithful ones who in
   this revival were brought into the light. Rev. M. V. Clute, of the
   Illinois Conference of the Free Methodist Church, has given me the
   following incident: "I was a lay member of the Congregationalist Church
   in a neighboring town. During the time of Mr. Redfield's labor in
   Syracuse I visited my brother in that city. While at supper the first
   evening, I was asked to go and hear him. When we arrived at the church
   we found the seats near the door occupied, and were obliged to take one
   near the pulpit. In a very short time the house was crowded; those who
   filled the aisles stood, while those between the seats and the pulpit
   sat on the floor. He had been preaching but a few minutes when the
   heavy breathing of a person attracted my attention. For some time I
   could not make out who it was, when at last a man sitting on the floor
   threw up his hands, and exclaimed in a loud voice, "O God!" The next
   moment he sprang to his feet, and with arms extended, started down one
   of the aisles toward the door, groaning as he went. The people made way
   for him, and he crossed behind the body seats and returned up the other
   aisle. As he reached the pulpit, he screamed and fell to the floor.
   During the time Mr. Redfield, in perfect silence, stood leaning on the
   pulpit watching him with great interest. For a few moments after he
   fell there was perfect quiet throughout the room, when suddenly from
   eighteen to twenty persons sprang to their feet and ran, praying, to
   the altar."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 40

   Mr. Redfield was now invited to Albion, N. Y., by Rev. W. C. Kendall,
   of blessed memory. Mr. Kendall was a minister of more than ordinary
   ability, and of deepest piety. He was noted for his faithfulness as a
   pastor and preacher. He had been well received in Albion at first, but
   when it was found impossible to get him to moderate his zeal, to lower
   the standard of piety, or to cease insisting upon the membership living
   up to the rules of the church, some of the most influential members
   turned against him. He commenced revival meetings amid great
   opposition, and finally sent for Mr. Redfield.

   Mr. Redfield was well received at first, and soon conviction became
   general. At last the power of God began to come, and one night two or
   three fell. One was a Baptist. This frightened the people, and many
   hurried out of the house. Some ran for water to resuscitate the
   prostrate ones, while others broke window-lights to let in fresh air.
   Now some cried out that Mr. Redfield had mesmerized these people, until
   many in the church became alarmed and others angry. Then persons began
   to lose their strength at home, and some even miles away. It was well
   for the revival that Mr. Kendall was preacher in charge, for he was in
   full sympathy with Mr. Redfield, and gave him complete control of the
   services. In meeting and breaking through opposition, he was one of the
   most successful of evangelists. If permitted to act freely he scarcely
   ever failed to succeed. He now had the utmost freedom, and soon the
   tide of conviction rose above all opposition. The scenes of power in
   the services and in the homes of the people were marvelous. In the
   midst of this the following incident took place.

   Rev. J. M. F, a former pastor of the church, was overheard to make the
   remark, in the Methodist Book Room, in Buffalo, that "Kendall has got
   Redfield to help him in a revival at Albion, and I must go down and
   attend to matters there." The word was brought to Albion by Rev.
   Brother T, who heard J. M. F say it. This brother related the matter at
   Mr. Kendall's tea-table. With a look of serious alarm, not easily
   forgotten, Mr. Redfield turned to Mr. Kendall, and said: "It is my
   request that you do not ask Mr. F into the pulpit, if he attends the
   services. It is obvious that his errand here is to guard his friends
   against my peculiar teachings, and for him to sit with me in the pulpit
   is to pretend to be my friend. God cannot endorse such a two-faced act;
   and my soul abhors such hypocrisy. If you wart God to help me to preach
   tonight, see that you do not ask that man to take any part in the
   service."

   Mr. Kendall, after a few moments thought, replied, "I do not think I
   could ask him, no matter what the consequences may be." [3]

   Mr. Redfield's description of his feelings and motives will give a view
   of his character, and a clue to his wondrous power.

   "This man (J. M. F.) came into one of the afternoon meetings, and
   knowing what his object was in coming to Albion, I was overcome with
   grief. I went up into the pulpit, and got down out of sight and prayed,
   "O my God, why hast thou sent me out at the loss and cost of all
   things, and then allowed such men to make my way so hard? He lives on
   the fat of the land; is pampered with a large salary, while I go
   unpaid, meet the brunt of battle, and have to fight the devil, the
   world, and a dead church, and preachers besides." I felt as though my
   case was too hard. My bursting heart was so full that I put both hands
   upon m mouth to keep from bellowing aloud. And I said, "O, Lord, I can
   go no further!" Then the old voice rang again in my ears, "You may live
   while you preach and no longer." Oh, how I wished these ambitious,
   wicked men could have seen how God had to push and crowd me out against
   their opposition. But as usual, I had at last to come to the point
   where I could say, "I have not yet resisted unto blood striving against
   sin. It will not be long before I will be called away, and I'll let God
   settle all this." I saw somebody must stand up for God and the right,
   and it may as well be me as any one."

   In the evening, as the congregation were seated after singing the
   second hymn, the house being very crowded, this man entered and made
   his way down to the altar. He looked up into the pulpit, and, as he was
   not invited to enter that, he seemed embarrassed, his face reddened, a
   pew door opened, and he was provided with a seat. That night Mr.
   Redfield preached one of his most awful sermons, from the text: "And
   for this cause shall God send them strong delusions, that they should
   believe a lie that they all might be damned, who believe not the truth,
   but have pleasure in unrighteousness." -- 2 Thess. 2: 11, 12. Those
   only who have heard him can imagine the pictures he drew of those who
   had lived in the church for years without saving grace; who had sat
   under the most searching gospel ministry; had seen the truth
   exemplified in the lives of some around them; and yet closed their eyes
   and ears to it all, rather than pay the price and humble themselves by
   repentance and confession, and take the way of self-denial and the
   cross of Christ. He then outlined the track of those minister's who
   have managed for years to preach without the Spirit, and have learned
   to lie to the people by telling them the way was not so narrow after
   all. They had become such adepts in lying that they preached and seemed
   to believe that we have "peace in Christ, and joy in the world," in
   common with all men (a doctrine this very man had preached). They lived
   for money, and had found that some churches would pay the best to the
   man who would preach to them such stuff. And no wonder they were in
   trouble, when a man came along who would preach the whole truth, and
   plainly point out that the wrath of Almighty God was upon sin and
   sinners in the church.

   The effect of this sermon was electric. The Holy Ghost so attended it,
   that members of other churches were shaken as by a whirlwind. Some
   cried out, some fell prostrate before they could get to the altar, and
   others fell at the altar. That night and the night following, the
   prostrated ones lay in some places upon one another, until the aisles
   were closed for hours and the congregation literally hemmed in.

   The minister referred to, fled as if in consternation, as soon as he
   could make his escape. Before he left the place, by the circulation of
   slanders against Mr. Redfield, he alienated many of the members of the
   church, who finally withdrew from the meetings, and at last became
   bitter opposers of the work. Among those whom he attempted to influence
   was an ex-senator. This brother came to Mr. Kendall to labor with him,
   when the following conversation took place:

   "I feel very much grieved and tried with you. You preach to us that we
   should treat each other with Christian courtesy, yet you have not
   invited Brother F_____ to preach since he has been here, and he feels
   very much hurt over it."

   "Well, Brother H_____," replied Mr. Kendall, "I can now say to you what
   I could not have said before in regard to that: and I'll ask you, How
   could I invite him to preach or take part in the meetings when I knew
   he had come here to put a stop to them?"

   "What do you mean?" asked Brother H_____.

   "I mean just what I say."

   "How do you know that he came here for that purpose?"

   "Brother T_____ came to me and informed me that he heard Mr. F_____
   say, before he came here, Kendall is holding revival meetings at
   Albion, and has Redfield to assist him, and I must go down and stop
   him.' "

   "Is that so?" asked Mr. H_____.

   "It is even so," replied Mr. Kendall.

   Mr. H_____ went home and found Mr. F_____ there; and said to him, "I am
   greatly astonished to learn that your business here at this time was to
   stop this revival; and more, that you should claim to feel grieved
   because you were not invited to preach!"

   "It is all a lie," said Mr. F, "let who will say so. I never intimated
   any purpose of that kind."

   "It is true, sir," said the minister who brought the report, and who
   happened to be present. "I heard you say it before you left Buffalo."

   In this instance this opposer's efforts were a failure. If the same
   could be said of all his efforts to oppose the work of holiness,
   different results would have occurred in many instances. Mr. Redfield
   told the congregation, that observation for some years, had taught him
   that any person who passed through a genuine revival without yielding
   to the truth of God, became from that time a standing committee to
   fight God and holiness. This proved true of many in the place. They
   became the persecutors of those who undertook to follow God fully. The
   minister who came to Albion to oppose the meetings became a bitter
   persecutor of holiness teachers in the ministry, and has claimed the
   doubtful honor of producing the state of things which caused the rise
   of the Free Methodist Church, an organization which resulted from this
   same persecution. [4] This man entered the army after the breaking out
   of the rebellion of 1861, was subsequently accused of defrauding the
   government, was indicted for the offense, but for some reason was never
   tried. At the time of this writing, December, 1887, an effort is being
   made in Albion, where he attempted to stop the revival described in
   this chapter, to raise money to relieve him from severe destitution.

   An incident occurred during this meeting worthy of note, and which
   illustrates the thoroughness of Mr. Redfield's work.

   He labored to bring all to the gospel level by noticing the poor, and
   especially the colored poor. We have already seen him identified with
   the antislavery struggle. In the Albion church there were some who set
   themselves against the colored people strongly. Mr. Redfield told them
   several times that he never saw a revival that was complete until all
   such feelings gave way.

   One night a colored woman, who was a model of neatness and
   unobtrusiveness, arose and testified to having found salvation. Mr.
   Redfield, noticing that some received her testimony with disdain, made
   his way through the crowd until he reached her, and taking her by the
   hand, began to sing an inspiring salvation song. The colored sister
   became very happy, and jumped and shouted aloud. The Spirit of God very
   evidently endorsed the action of Mr. Redfield, for the power of God
   came upon the people in a remarkable manner. One family refused
   afterward to kneel at the altar with such trash, but a score of
   families from among the poor came and found salvation.

   The following letter, from the pen of Mr. Kendall, written at this
   time, will give something of an idea of the work and the circumstances:

   "Albion, February 3, 1855.

   "Dear Brother P_____; I was glad to hear from you and of your
   prosperity in the narrow way. I rejoice with Brother Tinkham and the
   pilgrims in Taylorville, that salvation descends there.

   "That man of God, Dr. Redfield, is with us. We have hard battles. The
   Doctor came a little more than a week since. His shots are finding a
   lodgment in the hearts of the King's enemies. He says that "many here
   are stuck down in the slough of I won't." Our official members are
   great hindrances. Entire holiness is gloriously prevailing; young
   converts and little ones are pressing into the possession of it, and
   their influence is being felt.

   "We have good congregations -- very attentive. Brother Redfield is much
   thought of, and I have no doubt will be the means of great good.

   "The pilgrims are having a fight of afflictions in this region, such a
   they never saw. You may know something of it when I say that I have
   received five letters of remonstrance lately; i. e., before Brother
   Redfield came. They have called us 'stumbling blocks," and frequently
   "fanatics." They have said: the devil was speaking, through me; that my
   course was "unhallowed," "unchristian," 'self-sufficient," "impudent,"
   etc. One local preacher has said about town, of Dr. Redfield, "That old
   fanatic! he don't know anything about preaching!" But glory to God! he
   "rules the whirlwind and directs the storm." It is breaking; and at the
   same time we hear talk that the trustees are going to close the house
   against us. We have no fears. It is one of the devil's scarecrows. Such
   times were never before in Albion. I wish you were here.

   "Our house was crammed Sunday night from top to bottom; but salvation
   came. Last night, also. Two lost their strength -- a thing never known
   in Albion until this winter. The people are filled with wonder and
   dismay. Officials, thus far for the devil, begin to cower. There is
   great danger that Jesus will become popular. Dr. Redfield says it will
   take the devil six months to repair the damage done to his kingdom
   already. "My voice is still for war," is his watchword. We look for a
   mighty shaking. Glory to God for salvation!

   "Your pilgrim brother,

   "W. C. KENDALL."

   From the following letter it would seem that Mr. Redfield was having
   more calls than he could fill. The letter gives us a glimpse of his
   inner life, of his deep concern for the Kingdom of God.

   "Albion, January 31, 1855.

   "Dear Brother Hicks: -- Your letter was received yesterday and my heart
   was deeply pained for the pilgrims at Syracuse. If I could cut off and
   send my feet one way, and my arms another, and then the stumps of this
   old body another, I would do it. I want to go twenty ways at once, and
   would, if possible. My spirit feels oppressed and bowed down by one
   little body, and it seems sometimes more than I have patience to bear.
   I see so much to be done, so little to do it, and so few that dare do
   the right thing for God, I feel addressed and ask, O God, must all this
   work be left undone ? I cannot bear the thought, and yet what can I do
   My spirit struggles and gasps to be free, and go free all over the
   world, like the lightning on telegraph wires. But I cannot. What shall
   I do? Only snail it through the world? But I must have grace to bear
   it.

   "I cannot leave here for a few days yet. God is coming, and promises to
   come in more awful power.

   "My love to all the pilgrims.

   "Yours forever,

   "J. W. Redfield."

CHAPTER 41

   At the close of his labors in Albion, Mr. Redfield went directly to
   Bridgeport, Conn., for the last protracted meeting of the season. Here
   he found a pastor with a clear head, a pious heart, and unflinching
   integrity. But the meeting had scarcely commenced before he felt one of
   his old burdens coming on. At first, as usual, he misread the feeling,
   and concluded it was preparatory to an attack of apoplexy. H attempted
   to leave the meeting, but failed. He then turned to his medicine case,
   and took a remedy he thought would leave him; but with no good effect.
   He then began to see that it was a "burden," -- the spirit of prayer.
   His agony for souls became very great. The sensation was as if mighty
   hand took hold upon his brain, drew it up, and then thrust it back with
   a painful shock. This occurred several times. Every time he would cry
   out, "I will hold on until salvation comes." When suddenly he was
   relieved, and the power of God fell upon the people in a wonderful
   manner.

   A Baptist deacon arose from the altar, and went reeling and tottering
   about, his face all radiant with the joy that filled his soul, and
   professed to have experienced the great blessing of perfect love. This
   was a surprise to his people, for they thought him eminent for piety,
   and in their opposition to the doctrine of holiness, they had been
   known to say: "But there is Deacon O_____, and he never says anything
   about holiness." But, now, after the deacon had professed to have
   experienced it, they said: "Well, we have always been a little
   suspicious of him."

   So great was the ingathering of souls during this meeting that it was
   necessary to build a new church to accommodate them.

   The following are some of the incidents of the work:

   A lady member of one of the city churches came and was convinced that
   she was without the saving grace of God. This brought her into great
   distress of mind. Her mother came to Mr. Redfield and made a statement
   of the case. She said: "My daughter is in despair. She has been a
   member of the church for ten years. Her minister has been to see her,
   and has tried to persuade her not to give up her hope. But she told him
   that she had been deceived for ten years, and had just found it out.
   She then requested him to let her alone, and not to deceive her again.
   The deacons of the church came to see her, also, but she tells them the
   same story, and refuses to be comforted. Now, what shall I do? Shall I
   try to comfort her?"

   "No, madam," said Mr. Redfield, "by no means; unless you desire to
   deceive her again. When she yields up her will to God she probably will
   find relief."

   "But I fear she'll become deranged," replied the mother.

   "Better be deranged and die so, in trying to be honest and to get
   right, than to go on as a deceived person, and die in that condition."

   "But she has eaten nothing for three days."

   "Well, some spirits have to be starved out."

   "Well, what shall I do?"

   "You can pray for her; deal faithfully with her, in pressing her to
   yield to God. But for her soul's sake, don't speak peace; let God do
   that."

   About 12 o'clock the next night God spoke peace to her soul. Mr.
   Redfield was greatly encouraged when she related her experience the
   next afternoon. She told the congregation, that at first she was very
   angry at Mr. Redfield for disturbing her peace of mind, and then with a
   radiant face, she exclaimed, "But, oh, how glad I am that he dealt
   faithfully with me"; and turning toward him, said, "Do let me exhort
   you to be faithful wherever you go."

   For a day or two during the meeting, Mr. Redfield had missed a brother
   who had taken a very strong stand for holiness, when one day he and his
   wife called. He seemed in great distress of mind. He said: "When I went
   from meeting a few days ago, I was fully determined to follow the
   leadings of the Holy Spirit. When I got home the Spirit said, "Lie down
   on the floor and prophesy that you will now die."

   "But you did not die?" interrupted Mr. Redfield.

   "Oh, no!" said he; "then the Spirit told me to prophesy that the man in
   the house opposite would die before morning,"

   "Did he die?"

   "No! Then the Spirit told me to go into the streets and sing, "Pink and
   senna"; and to go singing it into the drug store, and call for a large
   amount of it. Then I was to make a decoction of it, and give it to my
   children, to guard them against sickness. I did so, all but giving it
   to the children. Next the Spirit told me that as I had once loved a
   lady before I married my present wife, that, therefore, I was guilty of
   adultery with her; and I must go and confess it to her. But I knew I
   was innocent of such a crime. The Spirit then told me I must now part
   with my wife. Now what shall I do?"

   "Were you all this time led by this spirit?;

   "Oh, no!"

   "Let me ask you further, when this spirit was upon you, did you not
   feel wretched?"

   "I did! and it seemed I would die, my agony of mind was so great."

   "Well, brother, when any such influence comes upon you, no matter how
   like conviction of duty it may appear, if it brings distress of mind
   instead of filling you with love and peace, resist it as you would the
   devil, for it is the devil. God's Spirit never distresses one except
   those burdened with guilt. He leads by light, and love, and peace."

   In connection with this incident Mr. Redfield penned these thoughts
   upon the subject:

   "I have occasionally met with similar cases. To my sorrow, I have known
   some of the best of people to get frightened, and thinking insanity was
   being caused by the meetings, have insisted upon their being closed. I
   saw, I thought, that in "following the track of Jesus, we must pass
   these temptations also; and if the church did not have the discernment
   to distinguish between temptation and insanity, we would be liable to
   do irreparable injury to the work of Christ."

   From Bridgeport Mr. Redfield went to the scenes of his childhood. There
   he attempted to do his duty in the fear of God. He preached the same
   gospel that he had heard in the same pulpit from the lips of Wilbur
   Fisk, A. D. Merrill and John Lindsay, all of precious memory. God
   responded to his truth with power, but in the midst of it, the
   unspiritual pastor arrested the work by bringing the meetings to a
   close. Full of sadness, Mr. Redfield visited the graves of his mother
   and other saints who, in former days, had worshipped God in the church
   near by. Here he wept over the desolations of Zion, and consecrated
   himself anew to the work of spreading holiness over the land.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 42

   In November, 1852, Mr. Redfield was invited to Henrietta, Monroe
   county, N. Y. The preacher was J. K. Tinkham, known for many years
   through Western New York for his powerful singing, and who passed to
   his reward in 1885. On his way to Henrietta, Mr. Redfield called on the
   presiding elder, who asked him where he was going.

   "To Henrietta, to assist Brother Tinkham," Mr. Redfield replied.

   "Well, I am glad you are going there, for there you can do no hurt,"
   was the elder's reply.

   But Mr. Redfield was becoming somewhat accustomed to such thrusts. On
   his arrival at Henrietta he found, truly, there was no danger of making
   matters worse. A once flourishing society was now reduced to eighteen
   members, and these were cold and formal.

   Mr. Tinkham proved to be a pleasant pastor to labor with. He feared not
   the truth nor its effects. In a few days came the tug of war. Men saw
   they must resist strongly or yield; indifferent they could not be. The
   Holy Spirit pressed home the truth until men began to confess their
   delinquencies. One night, an official member of the church confessed
   that although he had tried to keep up the forms of religion, yet he had
   been unsaved. His two boys who had grown up infidels were present in
   the congregation. He went to one of them and asked his forgiveness for
   living before him as he had. The young man was much mortified, and
   tried to quiet him. The father then went to the other, and confessed
   and asked his forgiveness; and with the same result. He then returned
   to the altar, and falling on his knees, cried out in agony for their
   salvation. There was no appearance of the answer before the meeting
   closed. But during the night the oldest son arose from his bed, came
   down the stairs into his parents' room, and begged of them to rise and
   pray for him. They did so, and soon he began to pray for his brother.
   The father went to look for him, and found him on his knees crying for
   mercy. He was brought down stairs, and their prayers continued until
   nearly morning, and both were gloriously converted. They came to the
   afternoon meeting the next day, with shining faces, ready to work for
   God. Such was the earnestness with which they went at it, that in some
   instances sinners left the house to get away from them. One of these
   fell outside the door, and another sprang over the fence near by, and
   fell there. They cried for mercy, were converted, and returned to the
   house before the close of the service to testify of what Jesus had done
   for them.

   The work now went on in great power, and awoke the opposition of the
   minister in another church. He tried first to proselyte the converts,
   but this failed, because of the thoroughness of their conversion. He
   then began to cry out against the work. Mr. Redfield now felt it his
   duty to speak plainly against a type of religion that would allow its
   possessors so to do. The opposition of the minister ceased and soon he
   was also saved, so that he would get happy in his pulpit, and shout,
   declaring he now knew what made the Methodists happy.

   The man who had the charge of the church in which this revival was
   held, has told the writer within a few years, that such was his own
   indifference to religious things, under the wretched influence of the
   church, that for some time after this revival commenced, he would light
   the house and return to his home and wait for the congregation to
   disperse, and then go and close the house for the night. But he heard
   so much about the manner of Mr. Redfield and the truths he preached,
   and his unsparing denunciations of sin, that he ventured to hear him
   one night, for himself.

   He says, "I thought I never heard it on this wise before. At first I
   rather enjoyed seeing others get it, but at last the lash came to my
   own back. Conviction set in, and soon I was at the altar fairly howling
   for mercy."

   Some of those who were saved in this revival are still living, and are
   illustrations of the thoroughness of the work that was there done.

   Mr. Purdy was present part of the time, and assisted in this meeting,
   with his usual liberty and power.

   While laboring at this place, Mr. Redfield wrote the following
   interesting letter to Brother Hicks, of Syracuse, N. Y.:

   "Henrietta, N. Y., Nov. 11, 1852.

   "Dear Brother Hicks & Co.


   "Some time has passed away

   Since I began to pray,

   I love the Lord today;

   Bless his name; bless his name.

   "Brother P_____ as usual ran away soon after my arrival. Oh, what a
   pity that such talents cannot be controlled and kept at work. But it
   cannot be helped. I suppose we ought to be more thankful for as much as
   we can get out of him, rather than to mourn because we can have no
   more. I will not yet abandon all hope that he will see his error.

   "Brother Woodruff is here. He is a man of God, and full of the Holy
   Ghost. Brother Tinkham and he are shoulder to shoulder pressing the
   battle, and resolved to have the victory. You may well judge that it
   will take a large degree of redemption power to raise from the dead the
   church in this place. But it begins to move some. About twenty have
   been converted, which in my judgment is equal to one hundred in
   Syracuse.

   "Brother W_____ and myself go next Saturday, or the following Tuesday,
   to Painted Post, where we hope Zenas, the lawyer will meet or follow
   us, and not run again. leaving us right in the cramps. From that place
   we expect to go to Buffalo.

   "Brother P_____ has not yet decided about getting the tent and going to
   Syracuse. Yet he seems full of faith that that is a move, which if
   carried out, promises much good to the old line. I think if such an
   arrangement could be entered into, and sanctioned and sustained by men
   of the right stamp, that there are many ministers who would willingly
   join the flying artillery, and that great and glorious results would
   follow. I wish that Dr. Bowen, or some one of his standing, would form
   a plan and lay it before one of our bishops for approval, and then I
   think that H_____ Mattison would find his guns spiked before he could
   do much damage. If the plan works, as I have no doubt it will, I think
   that at the next conference there will go out such a voice from that
   body as will make our way easy, and plain, and successful.

   Could you not draft a plan and send it to Dr. Bowen, and get him to
   enlist others whose influence will at once protect and give character
   to the movement? It seems to me that such is the condition of the
   churches, that some unusual effort must be made to check the progress
   of approaching ruin, and extend the borders of Zion to fields as yet
   unoccupied.

   "How are you all getting along? Are you at anchor? or drifting down
   stream? or rowing up? Don't get discouraged; God will yet give you
   victory; for if you cannot carry the opposition and turn them to the
   Lord, you can use them as polishing brushes to make you shine the
   brighter. I tell you heaven is in view.

   "I desire you would remember me to Sisters A_____ and A_____, Brothers
   B_____ and G_____, and all the disciples of Jesus. O Brother Hicks,
   encourage them to hold on and to fight manfully. I much desire to see
   you all, but at present I cannot see it possible.

   "Brother Hicks, would you like to take a little stock in heaven's
   savings bank? I will tell you how. You pilgrims just spend a little
   time every day in secret prayer that God may be with us who are
   laboring for souls at Henrietta, Painted Post, and Buffalo.

   "I would like to select my homestead near yours on heaven's public
   lands. If you assist me by your prayers we shall doubtless settle in
   the same neighborhood on the prairies of the New Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
   Amen!

   "J. W. REDFIELD."

   From Henrietta, at the request of a presiding elder, Mr. Redfield went
   to another place, where matters were in an equally bad state, though
   there were more members in the church. On his arrival, he found he must
   commence in the presiding elder's family, and he sternly rebuked the
   wife and some others for their bad example in wearing jewelry. They
   were much offended, of course. He found that the preacher in charge had
   no religious influence, because of his trifling manner among the
   people. But there was an old minister, who was without an appointment,
   but who had been on the straight track for thirty years, and who saw
   matters in the same light in which Mr. Redfield saw them. This was to
   him a source of great comfort and encouragement. He had often known
   ministers, in the heat of successful revivals, to take a stand for the
   right, but when they arrived at conference, and saw it did not meet
   with the approval of those in power, to look at their families, and
   almost empty pocketbooks, and then draw back. But here was a man who
   had stood; who had dared to do his duty, to follow the truth, and risk
   the consequences.

   The work had scarce begun before it became apparent that there were
   serious things in the way. Mr. Redfield consecrated himself anew to do
   faithful work. He said to himself, "I will only stop when I must. By
   the grace of God I will not swerve from the right. If I go down with
   the truth, I know Jesus will go down with me; and he will have a
   resurrection. I will be as honest with the people as though I was going
   immediately to the judgment. I know I am already in bad odor with the
   worldly and pleasure. seeking, in the church, and, probably, faithful
   work here will not improve my reputation: but I will leave all that to
   be adjusted at the judgment."

   He saw that representatives of Jesus must do something to restore
   themselves to the confidence of those outside the church. He urged the
   membership to make clean and thorough work in confessing their true
   moral state, so that the world would have the true standard of
   religion.

   When he had finished a sermon on this subject, an old local preacher
   arose and said, "This Redfield has insulted us. This church will never
   disgrace itself by making any such confessions as he urges. He need not
   come here to accuse us of having no religion. I know I've got religion;
   and, Oh! brethren, what a glorious time it will be when we all get up
   there."

   "If you ever get there," suggested Mr. Redfield.

   Next a son of this old man arose, who was also a local preacher, and
   with great vehemence denounced Mr. Redfield. The meeting closed, and
   one of the equally dead members of the church approached the old local
   preacher, and said, "I know the reason why you are so bitter upon the
   preacher because of this confessing business. You know you are guilty
   of crimes that would make a decent man blush." Not knowing that his
   life was so well known, the old man tried to deny it, and asked for the
   proof. The other called up a man who was present, and asked him, "Don't
   you know that this man is guilty of_____?" naming the crime.

   "Yes, sir, I do," said the witness. And then another, and another, was
   called on to testify, who witnessed to the same. The old man left the
   house not to return again.

   Mr. Redfield then took an expression of the congregation, sinners and
   all, whether the truth that will do to die by was what they wanted. A
   large number, by the uplifted hand, declared in the affirmative.

   The next night Mr. Redfield plainly saw that they had come to a point
   where somebody must act; and said: "I have gone to my utmost extent in
   preaching the word of God to you, and it all fails. I will now try one
   more thing; not to appeal to your conscience, for you have none. Bible
   truth seems to have nothing sacred in your esteem. You may possibly
   have some sense of honor; I will appeal to that. Now, when you joined
   the church you either did, or did not, know its rules. If you did not,
   here they are [holding out a copy of the Discipline]. They forbid doing
   harm, and command to do good. They forbid conformity to the world. Yet,
   in all that you are deficient. Now, make up your mind; can you, will
   you, conform to these rules? If not, then do have the honor to go to
   your preacher and tell that you can't live up to the rules and ask him
   to drop your name.

   Afterward Mr. Redfield learned that one of the principal members did
   so, and then said, "There, I have withdrawn from the church, for I am
   resolved to live and die an honest man." He also said to Mr. Redfield:
   "I have been kept in the church because I was reputed to be wealthy,
   and that, too, when it was known that I would swear."

   But to return; this looked severe to many, but the sequel showed that
   God was in it. This course raised a tempest. Immediately one of the
   leading members arose and said, "We have borne this abuse long enough."

   Mr. Redfield asked, "Will you show me what I have preached that is not
   truth?"

   "We believe it is truth," he answered, "but we won't stand it."

   The service broke up in a tumult. A large number came around Mr.
   Redfield and vehemently accused him of causing the disorder, -- five to
   ten speaking at once until he could not be heard. He went to his
   stopping place, at the presiding elder's, and fell upon his face before
   the Lord. He cried out, "O Lord, thou knowest I have not swerved from
   the right. I have gone as far as I can. I must now stop. I give the
   matter into thy hands." He then retired to rest with the rich
   consciousness of the divine approval. Soon the word came that two of
   the most faithful men in the society had fallen to the floor in the
   church, both burdened for the membership, and especially for the man
   who had talked so to Mr. Redfield. About two o'clock in the morning, he
   was awakened by a rap at his door, and was informed that the wife of
   the pastor was almost in despair, and desired him to pray for her. She
   had also requested them to bring Brother F_____, one of the brethren
   who was prostrate in the church, and he had been brought to her house,
   but he was perfectly stiff, and had to be carried. When Mr. Redfield
   arrived, the pastor's wife confessed that she had slyly counseled the
   sisters of the church to keep on their jewelry. She was now in great
   distress. They had not prayed long, when a messenger came and said,
   "Several members of the church are in a house near here, and they
   desire, all who can, to come and pray with them. And they especially
   desire Brother F_____ shall come." Several men picked him up and
   carried him there. After a little, a messenger came there with the word
   that a number of sinners were congregated in a house near by, and
   desired Christians to come and pray with them. Before daylight it
   became evident that the whole place was under awakening; and the result
   was a glorious ingathering of souls.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 43

   From the scene of the labors described in the last chapter, Mr.
   Redfield went to a place only a few miles distant. The preacher in
   charge was present the first Sunday morning. He said to Mr. Redfield,
   "We are expecting you to begin today. Now, do you object to a melodeon
   in the gallery? If you do, we won't have it used."

   "Don't let it sound a note," replied Mr. Redfield.

   "What about the choir?" asked the pastor.

   "Bring it down to the front seats, and let the whole congregation sing,
   in Methodist style," was the reply.

   Again, he began at the foundation. Holiness, inward and outward, was
   urged upon the people. When the truth was beginning to take a deep hold
   upon the congregation, he was waited on by a committee one day, who
   announced their business as follows:

   "Brother, are you willing to be faithfully dealt with, and, if
   possible, to remove all hindrances that are in the way of a revival?"

   "Most certainly I am," he replied.

   "Well, we have heard some reports in regard to you which are greatly in
   the way of the cause of God."

   "What are they?" he inquired.

   "We have heard that you are worth three hundred thousand dollars; that
   you own a most splendid mansion in New York; that it is furnished and
   decorated from top to bottom in the most costly manner; that your
   servants dress in livery; that you carry a costly gold watch, and that
   you come out here and pounce upon us for our paltry two and sixpenny
   gold rings; and we think this ought to be corrected."

   Said he, "I don't hold myself responsible for all the lies told about
   me, nor feel that I am required to correct everything that is
   circulated about me. If I did, I would have my hands full, and no time
   to work for God." Pulling out his plain silver watch, he continued,
   "That is all the watch I have. About the mansion: the report is true,
   except they have located it in the wrong place. As to the three hundred
   thousand dollars, I would not sell it for that sum. Indeed, I do not
   think I should be blamed for its possession, for it was willed to me by
   my elder brother, when he died. As to my describing it to please the
   fastidious, I shall not do it. This much I will say, it is fenced round
   with walls made of diamonds, amethysts, and other precious stones, and
   the walks are paved with gold. You may judge what the mansion must be."

   The committee bowed themselves out, and he heard no more of the matter.

   The revival was deep and extensive. It was estimated that nearly five
   hundred were converted. Some of the converts became remarkable for
   their piety, their activity, and their success as workers for Jesus.

   One young girl, about sixteen years of age, came to the altar one
   evening, and, turning to the congregation, said: "Farewell to you all;
   I am going to seek religion; and I will have it." Dropping upon her
   knees, she prayed most determinedly for salvation. She soon arose, and
   clapping her hands, gave glory to God. Then, turning to a faithful old
   preacher, and calling him by name, she said: "O brother, this is good.
   Oh, how I wish Jane had it"; and running to her sister Jane, she
   brought her to the altar. "Now," said she, "I want Mary "; and she went
   and brought her. "Now I must have Susan," but Susan ran out of the
   house. She then went for another, but that one refused; and the young
   convert fell upon her knees for a moment, and then led this one to the
   altar also. This girl had not been converted more then ten minutes,
   before she began to work for others, and in less than an hour she had
   led eleven persons to the altar; a work far beyond that of many in the
   church in a lifetime.

   God seemed to have, on this night, complete possession of the place.
   One sister arose and said, "Oh, what shall we do for some one to lead
   us on when Brother Redfield is gone?" And turning to the preacher ma
   charge said: "O brother, you must get the blessing of holiness, so you
   can lead us on."

   The preacher arose, and instead of being offended, said, "I will have
   it; and I desire you all to pray for me." He did get it, and afterwards
   said to Mr. Redfield, "I had it once before, and I preached it; and I
   had just such revivals as this. But I saw how some in the conference
   treated Brother Purdy, who is with you, and I was afraid I should get
   into bad repute among my brethren, as he has, -- so I lowered the
   standard, and lost the power out of my soul; and I have been thinking
   about locating. But now I shall take my old track, and risk the
   consequences."

   But, like many others, he afterwards failed to keep his promise. The
   next year the conference sent a minister to the place who was opposed
   to preaching and teaching holiness. This caused Mr. Redfield much pain,
   but he was comforted by hearing that one of the members had died in
   glorious triumph, having kept her experience until the end.

   Having closed his labors in this place, Mr. Redfield next went to labor
   in Bath, Steuben county, N. Y. Here he again raised the standard of
   holiness. Soon the work broke out in power. Here again the devil
   undertook to hinder the work by subjecting a woman, who experienced the
   blessing of holiness, to severe temptation. In her earnestness she
   promised the Lord she would follow the Spirit wherever it might lead.
   One afternoon, the impression came to her to go to the church to the
   meeting, and she arose and started. When about halfway there, the
   impression came to return home. She did this; and then it came to
   return again to the church, and when there to kneel in the end of the
   seat, so that the people who passed would have to step over her, and
   thus illustrate to them what stumbling blocks they were; and she obeyed
   it. Then the impression came, "This church is very proud, leap through
   the aisles like a frog to humble them"; and she did so. Then the
   impression came to call an old lady who sat near her, a hypocrite; and
   this she did. Then, following the same leading, she went after her
   daughter, who was in the house, and the daughter fled to avoid her. By
   this time the confusion became so great that the service was brought to
   an end. She went home, and the impression came to test her faith by
   sitting between a very hot stove and a wall near by. While at this, her
   husband, who was a physician, came home, and was informed of all that
   had occurred. Very much frightened, he hastened to the parsonage to see
   Mr. Redfield and the pastor. He declared his wife to be raving crazy,
   and that the meetings must stop, both for her good and the credit of
   Methodism. But Mr. Redfield thought he saw that it was another effort
   to dishonor the work; that these temptations sooner or later came to
   every one who was fully determined to follow Jesus. He then said to the
   doctor, "Don't you know that the determining symptoms are not insanity?
   This is only temptation. She will come out of it all right."

   "Well, what shall I do?" said the doctor.

   "Be quiet, and pray for her. Let her entirely alone, and she, will come
   out of it, and tell you it is all of the devil."

   The doctor was finally persuaded to drop the matter, and not interfere
   with the meetings. The next morning she came out of it all right, and
   the glory and power of God wonderfully rested upon her. She afterwards
   said she saw clearly that the strange influences she experienced were
   all of the devil.

   But the report went far and near that the woman went crazy. Those who
   circulated it were careful not to say she was all over it the next day.
   This was also charged to Mr. Redfield's labors, and the people were
   cautioned not to employ him.

   The work in Bath went on in great power, and soon a jeweler was saved,
   and his conscience refused to let him buy or sell or mend jewelry, and
   it was reported that he had gone crazy.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 44

   After closing his labors in Bath Mr. Redfield went to the city of
   Buffalo, where he held a series of meetings in the Niagara Street
   Methodist Episcopal church. Rev. Benjamin T. Roberts, now senior
   General Superintendent of the Free Methodist Church, was the pastor of
   the Niagara Street society.

   On inquiry of an old minister, Mr. Redfield was informed that he had
   nothing to fear from the pastor, and "that the truth would be given the
   utmost freedom. When he arrived, he was informed by Mr. Roberts, and
   also by a leading man in the church, that Methodism was in a very low
   state in the city, and that it had been quite difficult to sustain
   prayer meetings in this church for a year or two.

   In due time the work began to move; Soon, among others, came to the
   altar a poor drunken local preacher, whom Mr. Roberts had found in the
   delirium tremens but a short time before, and God saved him. Then
   another one came who had been attending horse races in Canada, and he
   was saved. One woman of high standing made the confession that she had
   been wronging her own sister out of her portion of their father's
   estate, and had to restore it to find peace. This created great
   excitement and opposition. But the work went forward with power in the
   reforming, converting and sanctifying of souls. Many of the people
   began to take a strong stand for Bible holiness and Methodism. A sister
   B_____, one of the most fashionable members of that church, and who
   wore a very large amount of jewelry, laid it all aside, and went from
   house to house among her fashionable friends in the church, and upon
   her knees confessed to them the wrong she had done them in setting such
   an example, and came out into the light as a true and steadfast
   disciple of Jesus. In the midst of this revival the meetings of the
   General Missionary Society came on, and one service was appointed to be
   held in the Niagara Street church. Mr. Redfield called on the bishop
   and had a talk with him in respect to the decay of primitive Methodism,
   and asked him to say something during this gathering that would
   encourage the effort to build up the work. He related to him the cases
   of the two local preachers, among others, as illustrations and proofs
   of the genuineness of the work in progress. But the bishop turned upon
   him, and said, very abruptly: "I don't believe a word of it."

   Mr. Redfield saw he must now prepare himself for trouble. When the
   bishop preached he seemed to take especial pains to impress the
   congregation that he did not approve of Mr. Redfield's work. Dr.
   A_____. S_____, editor of the Christian Advocate, in an address went
   out of his way to declare that Christianity was not opposed to the
   luxuries and elegances of life, and indulgence in them was not
   inconsistent for Christians.

   At this time there was a sharp conflict in the Genesee Conference in
   Western New York, over the question whether the modern innovations upon
   Methodism should prevail. Mr. Roberts, Mr. Kendall, Eleazar Thomas, who
   years afterwards was massacred by the Modocs, and quite a number of
   others, were standing for the Wesleyan doctrine and experience of
   holiness, and the simplicity of Methodism. Now there crowded into the
   Niagara Street church the leading opposers of all this, and mingling
   among the membership, who were being graciously moved by the revival in
   progress, they circulated scandalous reports that had a tendency to
   stop the work. After they were gone, a lawyer V_____ came into one of
   the afternoon meetings to carry out the wishes of the opposition. He
   arose, and said, in substance, "We have been annoyed and disgusted long
   enough with this man Redfield, and now it shall come to an end. These
   meetings shall no longer be endured."

   Mr. Redfield was kept perfectly calm and sweet amid it all. When the
   lawyer was through speaking, Mr. Redfield asked him to state what had
   been preached that was contrary to the Bible and the Discipline. He
   sharply retorted: It's all true enough, but we won't stand it here
   anyway." Mr. Redfield was obliged to cease his labors there and go
   elsewhere.

   The Niagara Street Methodist church was then heavily in debt. Mr.
   Roberts offered to become responsible for lifting the indebtedness, if
   the trustees would make the seats free. His proposal was not accepted.
   The church was afterward sold for its indebtedness. It has since been
   used as a Jewish synagogue, until, within the last year, when it was
   purchased by the Free Masons for the purpose of erecting a Masonic
   temple on its site.

   During this time Mr. Redfield wrote the following letter:

   "Buffalo, N. Y., January 4,1853.

   Dear Bro. Hicks and Company -- I received your letter before I left
   Bath, which was last Friday. Since I last wrote you we have had hard
   battles, and some triumphant victories. Oh! how my heart ached when I
   learned how God's house of prayer has been turned into a den of
   thieves. But what can be done? I don't know! I don't know! May God help
   you to hold on a little while longer. There's a crown for you; hold on!
   hold on!! Hold on! !! Oh, how I want to see you! All your struggles and
   contests and toils make you all dear to me; and I know you are dear to
   him, "who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself."
   Think, dearly beloved, when you are writhing under persecution, God's
   word hath said, "He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye."
   Jesus has also said, "If they have persecuted me they will also
   persecute you." And, again, "It were better that a millstone were
   hanged about his [your enemy's] neck, and he cast into the depths of
   the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones which
   believe in me." Fight on, fight ever! Live on, and live forever. Amen!
   Hallelujah! Glory to God!

   "I want to hear from Mother A_____, particularly. I meant to have
   written her before this time, but do not remember her given name. Give
   my love to Sister A_____, and Brother and Sister B_____, and especially
   Brother S_____; in fact, all who love the Lord Jesus.

   "Brother W_____ is here, running the old line straight for God. I wish
   he could be preacher of the Brick church for two years. But it is
   useless to hope; the powers and members are all on the side of the
   opposition. It will not always be so. Jesus will by-and-by come and
   straighten all these matters. O my God, my heart feels almost ready to
   burst with anguish when I look at the desolations! What can I do? I
   don't know. What I mean to do, I know. I mean, unless I backslide, to
   throw myself into the hottest battles. They may ride over me, fight me,
   spit on me; but in the name of God, when I see them stabbing at Jesus,
   they shall sheathe their swords in me first, if I can get between them
   and him. If I cannot conquer for Jesus, I can die for him I have tried
   to make a bulwark of my reputation, and of all I hold clear on earth.
   Let them batter me, I'll go singing, "I'll stand the storm, it won't be
   long." But how much I need of salvation's power, of humility, meekness,
   gentleness, goodness.

   "It encourages me as I go from place to place to think of the precious
   few who are holding on. Yet when I see some coming out into the light
   and shining with the blessing of perfect love, I ask: Who knows what
   their next preacher will do? Likely enough he will try to undo the
   whole work. But I think of the little band at Syracuse and other
   places, and I am again encouraged to hold on, and I sing again, "I'll
   stand the storm."

   "God bless you all.

   "J. W. REDFIELD.

   From Buffalo Mr. Redfield went to Townsendville to the help of his
   especial friend, Rev. J. K. Tinkham. A glorious revival occurred, and
   man were converted.

   From Townsendville Mr. Redfield went to P_____ B_____ (probably Port
   Byron), to assist Brother P_____ (probably Purdy), in a church which
   once belonged to the Presbyterians, but had been sold to pay the
   preacher's salary. What were the results of this meting cannot now be
   told, but the need of a revival is seen from the circumstance just
   related.

   He now went again to Syracuse to visit the brethren. After a few
   services had been held, it was determined to build a church. A cheap
   building of rough hemlock boards, and plastered with one coat, was
   erected and dedicated to God. An engraving of it, that heads a letter
   written from this place to Rev. W. C. Kendall, shows it to have been
   the extreme of plainness and simplicity. From the beginning of the
   effort their meetings were attended with great manifestations of power
   and success. The opposition manifested by Methodist preachers during
   the great revival in the Congregational church, a short time before,
   broke out anew. But the presiding elder favored the new movement, and
   those engaged in the work were organized into the Third church. The
   course of the elder changed the controversy to the question of the
   wisdom and legality of his administration. But the conference was
   willing to accept of the new society, without regard to the question of
   legality, and sent them a preacher. The society soon found, however,
   that the preachers appointed by the conference were opposed to the
   spiritual freedom enjoyed by the membership.

   After some years an effort was made by the preachers to disband the
   society; but God had raised up a layman of deep experience and
   determined spirit, who could not be coaxed or driven from what he
   thought was right. This was Charles T. Hicks, to whom the letter in
   this chapter is addressed. He was a man of fine business abilities,
   which kept him in the recorder's office of the county, either as head
   officer or deputy, for more than forty years. It is said that in his
   work of recording, during all this time, there is not a mistake or an
   erasure to be found. In his religious life he seemed to follow the Lord
   in like manner. Radical upon every question in which morals, or the
   rights of God or man were at issue, pronounced in the expression of his
   opinions, and filled with the loving tenderness of the Christian, he
   was well fitted to stand in the front and take the blows and rebuffs
   that came in the path of duty. It was often his duty to pronounce the
   oath for witnesses in the courtroom, and it is said of him, that men
   who were expected by their employers to swear falsely, were sometimes
   frightened into testifying to the truth by his manner.

   The new society lived and flourished, more or less, at times; had its
   revivals and declensions, became at one time an independent church,
   and, finally, when the Free Methodist Church was organized, became
   attached to that body.

   How long Mr. Redfield remained at Syracuse after the organization of
   the Third church, or where and how he spent his time after leaving
   there cannot now be told, but the next trace of him is found in 1855,
   where, in Burlington, Vermont, he was engaged in one of his most
   successful meetings.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 45

   In February, 1855, Mr. Redfield was invited to visit Burlington,
   Vermont, and assist in a protracted meeting. Mr. Purdy had preceded him
   two weeks, and in his characteristically thorough manner had prepared
   the way for Mr. Redfield's coming. There had not been a revival in the
   place for twenty-one years. The pastor was favorable to old-fashioned
   Methodism, and stood by the work like a man of God. Opposition from
   other churches set in, as was often the case in those days, but God
   gave the victory. Many remarkable conversions took place, and the
   revival spread through the town and the community round about, until
   more than one thousand persons had been converted to God. So many were
   the accessions to the Methodist Episcopal Church that there was strong
   talk of organizing a second church, and erecting another place of
   worship. This met with great opposition from some of the conference
   ministers who thought that Methodism had become numerically so strong
   that one society and a stately edifice which would vie with those of
   the other denominations, was the better policy. Mr. Redfield advised
   against this, as those who were in favor of it among the membership
   were such as were of no assistance in revival work, and such a policy
   would bring them to the front and endanger the spirituality of the
   whole. Besides this, he feared the bringing in of a spirit to outdo
   other churches, which would undoubtedly grieve the Holy Spirit.

   The next pastor, who came soon after the revival, endeavored to carry
   out the policy advocated by the preachers at conference, but failed,
   and the new organization was effected. An effort was now made to
   counteract Mr. Redfield's influence and build a fashionable church. To
   do this, slanderous stories were circulated about him, in regard to his
   wife, who had deserted him nineteen years before. But the second church
   was built, much according to his advice, and the society became a power
   for good.

   In The Congregationalist, of Boston, Mass., for February 11, 1886, I
   find the following with respect to this revival. The writer, Rev. R. B.
   Howard, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in a sketch of Rev. C. L.
   Goodell, D.D., of St. Louis, who had lately died, says:

   "Toward the close of young Goodell's last college year, 1855, a
   remarkable work of grace, beginning in the Methodist church, in the
   village below, under the labors of a Doctor Redfield, a popular,
   eloquent, and successful revivalist, gradually spread up to the
   college. Goodell, meantime, with several other college students, had
   become greatly interested in Doctor Redfield and his meetings, not so
   much on religious grounds as on the score of his eloquence, and the
   marvelous sweetness of his singing. The writer will never forget seeing
   Goodell and another gifted classmate, by the name of Robinson, night
   after night elbowing their way to the front, and sitting flat on the
   carpet before the pulpit -- the house being too full for them to obtain
   seats -- for the sake of listening to the wonderful oratorical flights
   of that now long since departed, but gifted evangelist; little
   dreaming, meanwhile, that he was himself so soon successfully to engage
   in the same glorious work of calling sinners to repentance."

   In a letter to the California Christian Advocate, by the same writer,
   about the same time, I find the following:

   "It so happened that Dr. Goodell and the writer were converted in the
   same revival at the University of Vermont, in connection with the
   labors of an eloquent and successful revivalist named Redfield. The
   revival proper was conducted at the Methodist church, but the good work
   extended to the University, where, in a few weeks, twenty-five or
   thirty young men were converted, many, if not most of whom, became
   ministers."

   A letter written to Rev. W. C. Kendall, at this time, reveals the
   spirit that actuated the man:

   "Burlington, VT., February 24, 1855.

   "Dear Brother and Sister Kendall, and the church of pilgrims who visit
   your house: -- "Your very welcome letter, postmarked the 21st, has this
   day arrived, and, oh! how my heart sunk within me, as I read that your
   church is wading through seas of conflict, and especially that your
   principal foes are among those from whom you have a right to expect
   better things. Your duty is plainly laid out before you. You must not,
   cannot, and I know you will not, sell out the interests of Jesus though
   all men forsake and persecute him in the persons of his disciples.
   Thank the Lord, there are some who will drink his cup and be baptized
   with his baptism. They can well afford to give all for God, for their
   record is on high. It does seem worth infinitely more than the cost to
   feel the blessed assurance that they are trying to be faithful
   representatives of Christ, and that he will say of them, as he did of
   Job, "They can be trusted." Yes, they will pass through the crucible
   and triumphantly shout, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him."
   Oh, how I want to bless you all! My heart, reputation, and life, are at
   the service of Jesus and the pilgrims. How it does encourage me to
   labor on, when I think there are a few faithful ones who dare to die
   for the blessed cause of the great salvation. I want you to greet all
   the blessed ones in my behalf. Tell Brother Seth [Woodruff, a layman of
   great religious activity and power in prayer], I will let him know when
   I go back to Syracuse, and I shall expect him to go with me. Remember
   me especially to Brother Roberts -- God bless him -- and your father,
   and Sister S_____. I hope when I return to Syracuse that she and
   yourself will come down and visit the Syracusans.

   "Brother Purdy left here on Monday last. As usual, he left his mark
   here. Many of the church have been quickened, and a goodly number of
   sinners converted. He received forty on probation the Saturday night
   before he left. He is now at Palmyra, but is to begin a meeting in Troy
   next week. He says he has no more work in Western New York, and of
   course I cannot expect him to go with me to Syracuse. If I go there I
   shall depend on Brothers Woodruff, Tinkham, Kendall, Wallace, and
   Roberts, and others to come to our help. I shall probably stay here two
   weeks longer.

   "Yours, etc.,
   "J. W. Redfield."

   He now, as the following letter will show, was connected with another
   physician in starting a medical infirmary at Syracuse, with a branch at
   Burlington, Vt.:

   "April 25, 185.

   "Dear Brother and Sister Kendall: -- "Ye troublers of Israel; the Lord
   bless you forever and ever. I returned to this place yesterday
   afternoon, and sat down to answer yours of the 16th, but I was so
   exhausted that I was compelled to defer it until this morning. It is
   refreshing, my dear troublers, to know that there are those who dare
   "hazard all for God at a clap," and then take the consequences. Let
   history, common sense, and religion answer the question of what would
   become of vital godliness in the churches in ten years if there were
   none to stand up for the truth. The ashes of the martyrs have been, and
   must be, the seed of the church. I think that neither you nor Sister
   K_____ are too good for such a fate. Jesus made himself of no
   reputation, and got killed for it. It is enough for the servant to be
   as his master. I thank God that some of us are counted worthy of shame
   for the name of Jesus. Oh, how it nerves me for the conflict when I
   remember that others with me are enduring cruel mockings. Amen!
   Hallelujah!! Go on, on, on, on. I want to see you very much, and I
   greet you in the name of the Lord. If Sister K_____ and others can come
   to Syracuse we can accommodate them now. I'm boarding with Doctor
   Wager, who is making arrangements to accommodate a number of invalids.
   I inclose a card which will direct to the house and office. The house
   is pleasantly situated, and abundantly large to accommodate a goodly
   number of pilgrims. The Lord willing, we mean to make it a pilgrims'
   rest.

   "I would like to go to your camp meeting, and will if I can make it
   convenient to do so. Give my love to everybody that loves Jesus.
   Business pressure compels me to be short this time.

   "Yours forever and ever,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   "P. S. -- We design to keep an infirmary.

   "R."

   On May 7, he wrote from the same place as follows:

   "Dear Brother Kendall: -- Your. favor of the 3rd has just come to hand,
   and glad indeed am I to hear from you, and most of all, from the tone
   of your letter, that you have not been bought, coaxed, nor frightened
   from your stand for God and the truth. Oh, how my heart takes courage
   at the sound of the war whoop from the few daring servants of God, who
   are big enough to be little, who know enough to be simple, and who have
   courage enough to dare to stand up and out, straight for the right! Our
   cause is right; it will triumph. We shall conquer. Go ahead, dear
   brother, and when your reputation is all exhausted in the war, you are
   at liberty to draw upon me for what fragments of a broken-down
   reputation I may have left.

   "We had great times at Burlington. Brother Purdy as usual, under God,
   put thing in their right places, and laid a foundation to build upon.
   How many were converted, as a result of his labors, I cannot tell, and
   probably it cannot be known this side of eternity. But if we may reckon
   on the reflex influence, as manifest in the many extensive revivals
   round about, that grew out of his labors here, I shall not go wide of
   the mark when I say that the number is about 2,000. Revivals sprang up
   in almost every quarter, from ten to one hundred miles away, as the
   result of Brother Purdy's labors. God bless him. You can form something
   of an opinion of it, when I tell you that at Burlington we had from
   sixty to eighty at the altar, and anxious seats each night in the main
   audience-room, besides a large number at the same time in the
   lecture-room; and that a new second church is now being erected, and
   the work is still going on; that in one place, fifty miles away, about
   fifty are at the altar each night, at another place twenty-five, and
   still another twenty, and in many other places from ten to twenty. One
   preacher, who came more than fifty miles to the meeting in B_____, said
   that our meeting was shaking almost the entire state of Vermont.

   "Well, dear brother, let them kill you if they can, and knock you all
   to pieces; Jesus will gather up every fragment at the last.

   "I feel a great desire to be at one of your preachers' meetings, and
   especially at the camp meeting. But I must go back to Burlington for a
   season to take charge of a department in a large infirmary. I spend
   only part of my time here, and I may be compelled to be there at the
   time of your camp meeting. I wish I was able to devote all my time to
   the work, but I am compelled to use part of it for the meat that
   perisheth.

   "Our terms, for board, washing and treatment, are $10.00 per week. This
   includes nursing, hydropathic and homeopathic treatment, and everything
   else pertaining to the good and comfort of the patient. But until we
   can get ready the great establishment we have in contemplation, we
   shall charge but $7.50. Our large establishment will cost from fifteen
   to twenty thousand dollars.

   "Yours as ever,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   Several important things may be learned from these letters:
    1. The absence in him of anything like rivalry, or vainglory. The
       letters of Rev. Mr. Howard show that Mr. Redfield was the principal
       figure in that great revival, but he gives the honor to his friend,
       Purdy.
    2. The fact that he did not make a gain of his work as an evangelist.
       The fifty or one hundred dollars per week charged by some modern
       evangelists would have enabled him to devote all his time to God's
       work, as he desired.
    3. The peculiar work in which he engaged now and then to replenish his
       purse.
    4. His hearty sympathy for all who were suffering for Jesus' sake. And
       there were many of these at that time.

CHAPTER 46

   While Mr. Redfield was engaged in the work of a physician at this time,
   he began seriously to consider the question of marriage. Nineteen years
   had gone by since his wife deserted him, and fourteen since the courts
   had given him a legal separation from her. Several years had also gone
   by since he, by two ministers of the church, heard that she was dead;
   and nothing to the contrary had ever come to his knowledge. A careful
   consideration of all the facts and of the law in the case, convinced
   him that there were no legal nor moral barriers in the way; and he
   determined to marry, if a suitable opportunity presented itself.

   One of the causes that led him to this decision was, that his enemies
   were continually taking advantage of his single condition to fabricate
   and circulate slanderous stories about him. He thought the presence of
   a wife with him wherever he went would put a stop to this; but, to his
   sorrow, he found this was not so.

   Among the many who came to the infirmary for treatment was a lady of
   more than ordinary intelligence, and who had had some experience in
   city mission work. She, like himself, had been unfortunate in her
   married life, and was now separated from her husband. Mr. Redfield
   finally proposed marriage to her, and his offer was accepted.
   Immediately after closing a revival effort at Keesville, N. Y., he was
   quietly married to this lady by a Methodist minister in the presence of
   a few witnesses.

   Instead of this hushing the tongues of his detractors, it only gave
   them a double opportunity to harass him. Because of this occasion for
   offense, as some judged it to be, some of his warmest friends were
   greatly afflicted. This hedged up his way in many places, and destroyed
   his influence. His was doubtless one of those peculiar instances spoken
   of by St. Paul, in which the lawful is not expedient. Since his death
   it has been remarked, and supposed to be true, that he regretted this
   step; but in a review of his life, written by himself, he has recorded
   this:

   "I went to Keesville, to hold a meeting, and about the close I saw fit
   to be married to one whom I then believed, and now know, to be in every
   respect a helpmeet to me in the gospel field."

   Mrs. Redfield, after a few days, went on a visit to her father's, while
   he went to fill an engagement to hold a meeting. The name of the place
   of this meeting he does not give, and the writer has no means of
   learning it. Of the effort put forth at this place he makes this brief
   record: "I again saw the power of God displayed."

   A few days' visit among his own people with his wife, and then they
   were away to Lima, N. Y., where he had been expected for some time.

   In a letter to Samuel Huntington, dated April 9th, 1856, two weeks
   after he left Lima, he wrote:

   "I found that two years before the church door was locked against the
   preacher (probably Purdy) and the people by one of the college
   professors. The principal teacher in the seminary was dismissed, and a
   woman, who made no profession of religion, elected in her place.
   Subordinate teachers were employed, who taught the Methodist girls of
   the seminary to dance.

   "Well, enough of this. We began the fight in the name of the Lord, and
   the opposition started. Then came out a large number of students --
   some of them confessed their opposition to the work when Brother Purdy
   was here -- and soon came into the enjoyment of justification, and then
   of sanctification; and then they confessed that the college influence
   had killed them. Soon the Lord had the quorum, and the opposition was
   compelled to stack arms. This continued until one or two fell in the
   street, and lay in an agony of prayer for the cause and the church. A
   goodly number of the young men are going out to preach full salvation,
   and some of them, if faithful, will make workers like Brother Purdy in
   zeal and firmness."

   Mr. Redfield's criticisms on the doings of the church, and the
   influence of the college and seminary on the young Christians sent
   there, finally occasioned his leaving before his work was done.

   A card from Rev. Woodruff Post, of the Genesee Conference, Methodist
   Episcopal Church, contributes the following:

   "A Mrs. Wilbur Hoag, though a professed Christian and a member of the
   church, had for a long time mourned, unreconciled, the death of her
   husband, -- to use her own words, "even to worshipping a spire of grass
   that grew upon his grave," -- was gloriously saved, so that she was
   enabled to triumph in the Lord, and with joy to say, "I give up all for
   Jesus." The rest of soul which she then experienced enabled her
   afterwards to triumph under the loss of her only child Julia, whom she
   had educated for a useful life."

   At this time a severe conflict was raging in the Methodist Episcopal
   Church, in the Genesee Conference, between those who were preaching and
   professing perfect love, and those who were opposed to the same.
   Charges were being brought against Mr. Kendall, Mr. Roberts, Mr.
   McCreery, and others among the ministry, while many among the laity
   were also passing through severe persecution from the worldly element
   in the church.

   For several years a laymen's camp meeting had been held annually near
   Bergen, Genesee, Co. New York, for the promotion of holiness. This had
   been under the charge of laymen, to keep it from being controlled by
   church officials, who were opposed to its object. This meeting was
   attended by such men as Seymour Coleman, B. W. Gorham, then editor of
   the Guide to Holiness, George Wells, Benjamin Pomeroy, Henry Belden,
   Fay H. Purdy, and many others, all mighty men of God, and noted for
   being advocates of the doctrine and experience of perfect love. This
   camp meeting was largely attended, and extensive in its influence.
   Wonderful were the manifestations of divine power that here took place.
   Multitudes were converted and sanctified, and many ministers received
   the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and went to their homes in distant parts
   of the country to kindle similar fires for God and souls. The grove in
   which these camp meetings were held was a magnificent one, held by a
   corporation, in trust, for religions purposes. When at last the
   administration of the church began to expel both ministers and laymen
   who were identified with this work, an attempt was made, and finally
   succeeded, to get control of this camp ground, to put an end to the
   meeting. Advantage was taken of a technicality in the articles of
   incorporation, in which the name of the Methodist Episcopal Church was
   used, and those who had contributed towards the purchase of the
   property, had it wrested from them under the forms of law. While the
   question of title was in litigation, those who were trying to get
   control of the same went, one winter, and cut down the entire grove and
   destroyed it for camp meeting purposes.

   It was at such a time as this, and in such circumstances, Mr. Redfield
   was now laboring. Every mistake of his was magnified into a crime, and
   many of his former friends, through fear and misapprehension, turned
   away from him. Those who knew him best, who had been brought into the
   closest fellowship with him, now drew closer to him than ever. Their
   private fellowship became intensely spiritual, and many were the
   special manifestations of the divine presence and favor they received,
   as they communed together, of their trials and conflicts, and
   prospects.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 47

   From Lima Mr. Redfield went to Rochester, N. Y. For several years he
   had felt that he had a work to do in that city, and now for the first
   time the way had opened for him to go there. The meeting was held in
   the First Methodist Episcopal church. The pastor, Rev. Jonathan Watts,
   was one of the corresponding editors of the Northern Independent, a
   brave man who dared to stand alone where principle was involved. Mr.
   Redfield thought he had reason to believe him prejudiced against him,
   personally, yet he acted like a nobleman. The presiding elder seemed to
   have been of another type, for knowing the revival meeting to be in
   progress, he appointed a special meeting to be held in the same house
   and at the same hour it was being occupied. The pastor, knowing his own
   rights, refused him the church. The other city preachers began to utter
   their protests against the work. One of them said to his flock, "If you
   don't keep away from the First church, I will vacate this pulpit." Some
   answered, "Then give us something to eat." When such efforts failed,
   the preachers collected together and discussed the propriety of
   allowing Mr. Redfield to stay any longer. In the midst of this, when
   the pressure was so great that he could hardly endure it, a man came to
   him one day and said, "We have $3,000 pledged towards building a church
   if you will stay and be the pastor." But he saw the result of this
   would be such a storm about him as he had never experienced before; and
   he replied that he could not accept of the offer.

   Just at this time he received a letter from Rev. David Sherman, of St.
   Charles, Illinois, inviting him to come there and hold a meeting. In
   the next chapter we shall see the beginning of his work in the West.

   During the time of his labors in Rochester, Rev. Charles G. Finney, the
   evangelist, was also holding meetings in the city, and occasionally
   came to the afternoon meetings conducted by Mr. Redfield. He, a
   Congregationalist, could endure and endorse what the Methodist
   preachers of the city could not. The two men seemed to enjoy each
   others' society, and to bid each other Godspeed in their mission of
   calling souls to Christ.

   Among the results of this meeting, quite a number of persons entered
   into the enjoyment of perfect love. Some of these have gone to their
   eternal reward, while others still hold on their way. Among those who
   experienced this great blessing was the wife of the world-renowned
   florist, James Vick, who has now, for more than thirty years, held up
   the light of a full salvation.

   Mr. Redfield was reluctant to leave the field and the little band who
   had been led into the light and who were beginning to walk with God.
   But the thought that perhaps he might find a field in the West, where
   the truth would be given free course, where the regular ministry were
   more humble and had more of the self-sacrificing spirit of the Master,
   helped him to a willingness to go.

   Before leaving here he wrote to Samuel Huntington, a full outline of
   his life, giving all the details of his family troubles, and the
   circumstances that led to his last marriage. It is not necessary to go
   over these again, as there is so much of it in these pages now. Suffice
   it to say, this was Mr. Redfield's first attempt at anything like a
   vindication of himself. The letter now before me is in his own
   handwriting, and corroborates the narrative of his sorrowful life
   contained in former chapters of this book. In this letter he authorizes
   Mr. Huntington to use the facts put in his hands in any way he sees
   fit. He also authorizes him to say, to those who are maliciously
   following him, that the matter has reached point where he feels that
   the cause of Christ demands that he shall hold them accountable to a
   bar of justice if they do not cease. The date of the letter discloses
   the fact that this correspondence was going on during a revival meeting
   of extraordinary power, in which were some marvelous manifestations of
   the divine presence. The whole gives us a view of a wonderful man, in
   many phases of his character; for no ordinary man could have done such
   work in such circumstances.

   April 9,1856, he wrote to the same brother as follows:

   "Dear Blessed Brother Sammy: -- "Your last came to hand, and no one can
   know but those who have been compelled to endure a living cancer, and
   smother it, and yet have the very misfortune made the occasion of
   persecution; I say none else can know how heart cheering it is to feel
   that there is here and there one to whom these trouble can be
   unbosomed, and who can appreciate them and offer consolation. But after
   writing you what I did, I felt some misgivings for troubling you; and
   on maturely weighing the whole matter, I thought I would trouble you no
   more with my woes. A main reason for telling you what I have, was to
   furnish you with reliable facts, to meet the preachers and people who
   defame me, and defend, not me, but the straight salvation; for I know
   that that is the true cause of all this opposition. I can give, if
   called upon, a justifiable reason for every act of my life, and good
   names and testimony of all matters connected with my whole misfortune.
   I have been so rasped and harrowed that I have thought I must give up
   and retire to private life. Finally, while conversing with Brother
   Burdick (a conference preacher), I made up my mind to make one more
   move, and take upon myself the responsibility to be myself, and cut off
   any further occasion for such slanders as were afloat in Burlington.
   And as there was no moral or legal impediment in the way, I have taken
   to myself a wife, one that is pious and well fitted to cooperate with
   me in labor meant to have seen you and laid the whole matter before
   you, but could not get the opportunity. And I further thought I was
   under no obligation to ask or inform the gossipers about the matter.
   You can find out all you wish to know of Brother Burdick.

   "I mean, if I can, to be at your dedication; but of that I must
   determine when I get West. When I see you, if you can bear with me, I
   will tell you frankly all the rest of my sorrows, if any good end can
   be secured by it.

   "I go from here to St. Charles, Kane county, Illinois, next Monday, for
   my last protracted effort. Brother Purdy left here this morning, I
   think rather discouraged as to any great results. If I can open his way
   satisfactorily, I think he will go West this summer. I shall try hard
   for it.

   "I have been in Rochester two weeks last Monday. The church will not
   get right, but the pilgrims from all churches come in. The altar is
   frequently filled, and we have some strong conversions. The house is
   very large, but will not hold the people. I never saw a greater chance
   for a great work in any place. But as soon as we get to a boiling
   point, the moderators put the fires out, and we have to start anew. My
   only hope is to strengthen the pilgrims, and get them to work for a
   salvation church. Many begin to see no other way than to go at it as
   you did in Burlington, and have a church where they can practice
   religion. But my ever blessed brother, happy day! God helping me, I
   will go the strong salvation to the last link of my chain.

   "Yours as ever, and forever,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   The sainted William C. Kendall was still laboring at Albion, only
   thirty-five miles away, and Mr. Redfield could not think of leaving the
   East without a brief visit with that blessed man. The visit was made,
   and again blessed in prayer, with and for each other, they parted in
   the early morning the next day, never to meet again on earth.

   At this time persecution was raging fiercely against many of Mr.
   Redfield's friends in Western New York. The Christian Advocate, a
   semi-official paper, published in Buffalo, was made the organ of those
   opposed to the doctrine and experience of holiness and the revival of
   the usages of Methodism. The columns of this paper were open to rumors,
   slanders, and ridicule of these devoted men. And even ex-Bishop Hamline
   was not spared, evidently, because of his identification with that
   doctrine.

   The only opportunity there was for defense was through the Northern
   Independent, a Methodist paper, published at Auburn, N. Y., edited by
   Rev. William Hosmer, a man noted for his piety and integrity. He had
   been editor of the Northern Christian Advocate, the official organ of
   several conferences in central, northern and western New York, but
   because of his radical and outspoken views on the question of slavery,
   which was then agitating both church and state, the preceding General
   Conference had elected a conservative man in his stead, against the
   wishes of the patronizing conferences. This led to the founding of the
   Northern Independent, with Mr. Hosmer as editor. Several prominent
   ministers were appointed corresponding editors, among whom was Mr.
   Redfield's, friend, Rev. B. T. Roberts. Over his own signature about
   this time, he attempted to show the character of this opposition to
   holiness, in two papers, entitled, "Old School Methodism" and "New
   School Methodism." For writing those articles, he was arraigned before
   his conference at its next session, on the charge of unchristian
   conduct. There was no attempt to deny the truthfulness of those
   articles, neither was Mr. Roberts allowed to prove his statements. Yet
   he was declared guilty, and sentenced to be reprimanded by the bishop.
   From this, he appealed to the General Conference. The following year
   Mr. Roberts was expelled on a charge of contumacy, for publishing an
   account of his trial the year before, and republishing in tract form,
   the articles on "Old School" and "New School Methodism"; though he
   proved by the real publisher that he had nothing to do with it, and the
   only evidence against him was that of one minister, who testified that
   Mr. Roberts handed him a package of the tracts for distribution; and
   the character of that minister, as a witness, was impeached.

   Mr. Roberts joined the church again on probation, immediately after his
   expulsion, and the following year, the minister who received him into
   the church, and several more who allowed Mr. Roberts to speak in their
   churches, were expelled for so doing.

   These historical matters will help to explain some things in Mr.
   Redfield's letters that otherwise would not be understood.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 48

   When Mr. Redfield received the letter from Mr. Sherman requesting him
   to come to St. Charles, according to his custom, he refused to go,
   unless he was also invited by the official board of the charge.
   Accordingly a meeting of the board was called, and a resolution
   inviting him to come was unanimously adopted, and immediately forwarded
   to him. As we have already seen, he accepted of the invitation, and
   soon was on his way to the place.

   On his arrival he found Mr. Sherman to be the young minister to whom he
   made the promise, when laboring with him in New England, that if he
   ever got into a place where he needed help, to send for him, and he
   would come to his assistance. He had been transferred to the West a few
   years before, and in the fall of 1855 was appointed to St. Charles and
   Geneva, in Kane county, Illinois. Mr. Sherman was one of that class of
   ministers who, in the absence of pulpit talent and commanding
   personality, was endowed with a copious fountain of tears; where he
   could not command, nor persuade, by forceful thought or well-put words,
   he could succeed by his tears. But for some reason he had failed to
   make much of an impression upon either the church or the world at St.
   Charles, and in his extremity he sent for Mr. Redfield. Mr. Redfield
   had preached but a short time before the various elements in the
   society were thoroughly aroused. The few who were endeavoring to serve
   the Lord drank in his teachings of the doctrine and experience of
   perfect love with avidity and delight. Some of these really understood
   him and appreciated his efforts. A brother and sister Osborne who had
   known something of his work in Western New York., promptly responded in
   approbation. Then there was Sister Snow, afterwards known as "Mother
   Foot," a Methodist of many years, well read in the theology, history
   and biography of the church, and who, because of her intelligence and
   force of character, had been a Class Leader for a number of years. Her
   watchful eye ever on the alert for any departure from "sound words,"
   perceived that the doctrine, the experience, and the methods of Mr.
   Redfield were Methodistic, and she gave her hearty approval of them.
   Father and Mother Garton, who had listened to the preaching of Finley,
   and Strange, and Christie, and Bascom, and many others of like
   character, were now made to think of olden times, and the old man would
   sing his old-time songs and hymns with new unction and relish. And with
   these was Sister Emily Laughlin, daughter of Father and Mother Garton,
   a woman endowed with remarkable good sense, deep insight into
   character, and an excellent faculty of saying the right thing in the
   right time and the right place. And there were others who had not
   forgotten God, who listened and took fresh courage, buckled the harness
   a little closer, and went into the conflict again.

   Some forty of the membership entered into the experience of perfect
   love. Some held back and refused to walk in the light. Several old
   church quarrels were stirred up, and the dirty sediment that by its
   settling to the bottom had deceived many with the idea that all was
   well, now rose to the surface in all its loathsomeness. Some became
   angry, some were frightened, and some "cared for none of these things,"
   and the meetings were forced to a close.

   But there were some glorious cases of conversion and sanctification.
   Among these was that of Charles Elliott Harroun, now and from that time
   a preacher of the gospel. At this time he was a member of the church
   and choir. One night he arose and spoke as follows: "Brethren I think
   if this is religion I never knew anything about it. And yet I've been a
   member of this church for more than three years." He soon afterwards
   was gloriously saved. He had been forward for several nights, and
   seemed to be struggling hard to find peace. At last, one night, he
   arose, and after a perfect silence for a few moments, and the
   congregation waiting breathlessly to hear what he had to say; he
   suddenly screamed at the top of his voice, "I'VE GOT IT!"

   Enough entered into the experience of perfect love, in addition to
   those who already enjoyed it, to make "the St. Charles Pilgrims," as
   they began to be called, noted through all that region for their power
   in prayer, the clearness of their testimonies, and the joyfulness of
   their lives. Their prayer meetings became seasons of glorious power,
   and the church was often made to ring with the praises of God.

   April 30,1856, Mr. Redfield wrote to Samuel Huntington again as
   follows:

   "ST. Charles, Kane Co., ILL.

   "My dear blessed Brother Sammy: -- I did not leave Rochester at the
   time I expected to, for the people would not let me off, and of course
   I did not receive your letters directed to this place, until I arrived
   here last Thursday.

   "I had felt for years a strong drawing to Rochester, but the way did
   not open until this spring. But such a clinch and contest I never had
   before. Brother Purdy came and staid a few days, but the opposition was
   so strong that he left, and I fear that he blamed me for not leaving
   also. But I did not feel at liberty to do so while so many of the
   pilgrim stamp were urging me to stay.

   "We opened meetings in the First church, and soon we were so crowded
   that large numbers could not find a place to stand in the church or its
   vestibule. In our congregation were the workers of all the Methodist
   churches and Presbyterians and Baptists, numbers of whom procured
   letters from their own churches and came and joined ours. Then the war
   began in earnest. Some of the Methodist preachers threatened to leave
   their charges if the members did not stay at home; and the answer they
   received was, "Give us something to eat, or we will continue to go."
   This brought the ecclesiastical batteries to bear on me. The presiding
   elder came down upon us, and appointed a business meeting in our
   audience-room, but the preacher-in-charge would not let him have it,
   and the elder behaved so badly that he brought himself under great
   odium. Then the preachers began to preach against us as croakers; but
   that did not take; and then they held an indignation meeting, and
   threatened the pastor with a conference castigation, and to publish me
   as an irresponsible ranter, a heretic, a divider of churches, a maker
   of the people crazy, etc.

   "Then the men of the world took it up, and I was informed that about
   five hundred in number proposed to build me a church where the great
   salvation could be preached without hindrance. You may rely upon it
   that we began to have pretty hot work by that time; and wonderful to
   tell, amid all this, God came in power and some of the most hopeless
   cases in the city were saved.

   "But I thought it best amid such a clatter, to break away and come
   West. It was hard parting with the multitude who followed us to the
   train; numbers of whom followed us for twenty miles on the cars, and
   who gave us their blessing and one hundred dollars in cash to help us
   on our way. They also insisted that we should come back next winter,
   and if the fight against us is too hot, to take the city hall until a
   salvation church can be built.

   "But I don't know about the propriety of such a move. My heart sank
   within me, and I asked, "Who and what am I, and what have I done, to
   merit such opposition?' I must say, I could but appreciate the great
   kindness of the true pilgrims who came long distances to meet us at
   Albion, our first stopping place, on our way to the West. Not
   withstanding all we passed through in Rochester, I feel confident, dear
   Brother Sammy, that the good Lord has made a mark in that place that
   will not soon be wiped out.

   "We arrived here on Thursday last. We found the people in waiting, and
   a goodly number of whom had been praying for our coming. This is very
   hard soil, but I do not expect much opposition, yet for a while, from
   the preachers; for they are, in many instances, too much engaged in
   speculation, some of whom make their thousands yearly. One presiding
   elder keeps a real estate office, and does business up to the last
   moment on Saturday, before going to his quarterly meetings, and then
   returns immediately Monday morning. This is a great field, and must be
   cultivated for Immanuel. Night before last we had a powerful
   demonstration in this place. I believe, if we can get down under the
   crust, we shall see salvation power of the right stamp.

   "This is a great place for backsliders who have come here from the
   East.

   "I have done as you requested, and have written a note to the paper
   where my wife used to live, and from where our certificate dates her
   residence. I told you one of my reasons for not publishing the fact of
   our marriage at Burlington. I knew I was doing nothing morally or
   legally wrong. I knew I would be a subject of suspicion; and I did
   design to make it known, believing that good people would appreciate
   it, and others would be quiet after the first blast was blown. But my
   wife had suffered so much from surmises and stories, that she was
   unwilling to have anything more said for the gossipers and scandal
   mongers to use. Her cancerous affection is such that any great
   disturbance of the mind aggravates her most agonizing symptoms. In one
   instance, after one of these disturbances, I had to watch over her
   night and day for ten days, before I could subdue her agony. Even your
   kind letter, which we found in waiting here, so overcame her, that I
   was fearful of the results for three days and two nights. There was
   evidently a transfer to the brain. She became almost wild. I feared,
   that in spite of all I could do, she would lose her mind. Her great
   trouble was the fear that our marriage would injure my influence. Under
   this, her distress became so great that I feared her cancer would break
   out, and then there would be no hope; and she must endure the most
   painful of deaths.

   "But, thank God, your last letter set all things right. O Sammy, how I
   did love you when I got that last letter! We both knelt down, and gave
   thanks to God for that blessed letter. I did think that my kind
   heavenly Father put it into your mind to write us that letter. May he
   bless you a thousand times.

   "But your first letter led me to a deep heart-searching of the whole
   transaction, and I fail yet to see but that I have done just right. I
   did believe that God led me to make the selection I did. I had learned
   about the gossip concerning her, and I went to the proper source and
   found that it was all false. I have since seen a number of the most
   precious saints I ever knew, who had been acquainted with her for
   years, and they, with one voice, pronounced her one of the most blessed
   Christians of their acquaintance. And I believe her to be one of the
   best Christians I ever knew. In each place where we have been, God has
   given her seals of her mission. Her very large correspondence, reaching
   all over the country, even to England, with those who have been helped
   in their religious experiences by her personal efforts, is to me a
   consoling proof that God owns her, and that she is the very one to go
   with me and labor as she does from house to house, as well as at
   church. She is a praying, devoted woman. How I have wished that her
   enemies could happen in upon her devotions and listen to the ardent
   prayers she offers for them.

   "I regretted that it was against her wishes for me to be open and to
   state what I had done, and what I meant to do; but when I saw how it
   affected her, I knew it was best to do as I did. In this I deceived
   nobody, for I was under no obligations to publish my moves and doings,
   as long as I did no wrong. I thought then, and I still think, that I
   was led by my heavenly Father to make the choice I did, and especially
   so after I found that she had been led to devote her life to religious
   work, visiting poorhouses and prisons, the sick and the suffering,
   distributing tracts and praying with the people.

   "If I had time to tell you the many strange providences which conspired
   to bring us together, and to show you the fruit of her labors, and how
   happy we are amid all our conflicts, and the protection she is to me
   many times when opposers who neither fear God, nor man, nor the devil,
   but who show a little deference to a woman, I think you would come to
   the conclusion that our union is of the Lord.

   "Yours in great affection,

   "J. W. Redfield."

CHAPTER 49

   While at St. Charles, Mr. Redfield wrote the following interesting
   letter to Mr. and Mrs. Kendall, which was evidently designed to
   minister encouragement in the midst of those degenerate times:

   "June 2, 1856.

   "Our very dear Brother and Sister Kendall: -- How greatly did we
   rejoice this day in getting a few lines from you; and though we
   sympathize with you, yet with you we rejoice that your ties are
   accumulating in heaven. This may startle you, but I think I have good
   reason to believe that it is not essential to breathe the outer air to
   secure a sentient immortality. We often look at your very life like
   pictures, and I never see them without a spring of joy, and a kind of
   sweet assurance that the originals have written on their every motive,
   Fidelity to God'. God bless you. We do love you; we can't help it; and
   we don't want to.

   "St. Charles has never been truly broken up; and the standard of a
   genuine, living, active, aggressive Christianity has never been
   preached here until Brother Sherman came. Much yet remains to be done,
   but I do think it looks somewhat hopeful, when pilgrims dare to pass
   through the streets, giving glory to God with a loud voice.

   "We would rejoice to be with you at your camp meeting, but we must be
   in Green Bay city, Wisconsin, and at a camp meeting near there about
   the 15th of June.

   "I thank the Lord that you still hold on, and press towards the
   narrowest of the narrow way. You will see great good, but it will be
   limited. You will be able to gather but little wheat among the many
   tares. Be content to be in the minority, for you will never triumph;
   but if unflinchingly faithful, the wheat you gather will be pure wheat.
   The wrong always has been, and always will be, in the ascendency. "Many
   will say Lord, Lord." Christ alone will end the contest, gather the
   little wheat, and burn the many tares. But, oh, my heart says, Go on;
   go straight: the salt of the earth, the seed of the church, are the
   martyrs. God will -- he does -- bless you; I know it, I feel it when I
   pray for you.

   "I think the pilgrims will yet have to organize a new church, and yet
   that will fail, if they do not guard every part of the Discipline
   against hard feelings against their oppressors . . . The opponents of
   holiness will conquer the pilgrims as long as they remain in the
   church, as slavery will certainly conquer in the legislation of the
   church. There is no hope but in getting away from so great a mass of
   corruption.

   "We must maintain the right though in the minority. It is better that
   few be really saved than that many be only half saved, and be lost at
   last. Your opponents may be silent, but not dead. They will bide their
   time, mature their plans, and make you at last feel their power.

   "Your presiding elder, _____ _____, is fairly in for it, and must now
   stand fire. I pray God that he may stand firm for the right. If he
   keeps to the right, God will see him out in the end, but not now. Now
   he must suffer, but the next generation will see him righted. Above
   all, God will approve him at the last.

   "Yours as ever,

   "J W. Redfield."

   After this meeting closed, Mr. Redfield spent a few days in Aurora, a
   young and flourishing city twelve miles south. Some of the St. Charles
   pilgrims went with him, and were a great help in the services. Here
   quite a number, also, entered into the experience of perfect love.

   The next trace we have of Mr. and Mrs. Redfield is at Mackinaw Island,
   recruiting their strength for the next season's campaign.

   While at Mackinaw, Mr. Redfield writes the subjoined letter to Mr. and
   Mrs. Kendall, which, to many, will be of special interest because of
   the views it expresses concerning the division of the church which he
   believed would result from the opposition the revival of primitive
   Methodism was destined to bring with it:

   "Mackinaw, Mich., July 27, 1856.

   "Dear Brother and Sister Kendall: -- Your letter of June 23 reached us
   day before yesterday. While we most deeply sympathize with you in your
   affliction, we thank God and take courage for the assurance we have
   that your faces are still toward Mt. Zion. The pamphlet you sent us is
   a rich and rare omen for good. It was read by the preacher at St.
   Charles before he forwarded it to us, and from his report I believe it
   has greatly strengthened him to hold on unflinchingly to the right.

   "Now I am no prophet, but I think we will never succeed in cleansing
   the church. God and truth have always been in the minority. Men act out
   the impulses of their moral state, they always have, and always will.
   You may, if you can, overwhelm and check their schemes, by gaining
   numbers to the cause of truth, but the devil never was known to
   surrender the wrong and to contend for the right. This will always be
   so as long as a single person is left unsaved.

   "Some ministers have never been converted; and others have backslidden.
   None of them can be brought to appreciate what we know to be right,
   until they are saved. God himself cannot make them love and sustain a
   cause at which their nature revolts. There are two distinct and totally
   opposite elements in the church, which can never harmonize until one
   gives way to the other. There seems no possibility of this. As God
   lives there is no rational hope but in separation; and yet I would by
   no means hoist the banner of separation, for you cannot then keep out
   the spirit of carnal warfare, and that will be death to spirituality.
   If our daring brethren will persistently hold on to their plan of
   resuscitating Methodist usages, and keep the central idea of Jesus and
   a full salvation before the people, they will yet see the day when the
   masses will be saved and go with them, and formalists will compel the
   separation. You have the right men for your leaders, and you have more
   sympathizers than many of you are aware of. Some of these have not the
   daring to stand alone, or even with a few in a cause which though right
   is unpopular. May the Lord bless the faithful ones.

   "We are getting recruited for the fall campaign. We have invitations to
   go into Illinois and Wisconsin, which, the Lord willing, we will
   respond to about the first or the middle of September.

   "Remember us to Sister S_____. If it is the Lord's will we would be
   glad to welcome Sister Kendall and her to this place. I don't know what
   success she will meet with in her application to Dr. Durbin [missionary
   secretary at that time, for a field of labor on missionary ground. I
   have my fears that she will not succeed, but hope for the best.
   However, the will of God be done. If I had a bank, and knew it was the
   will of God, I would open up a field in the West where she might begin
   to work for God at once.

   "My dear wife says, "Send her my love, with all my heart"; so you see
   you'll have to come here to bring it back.

   "Yours as ever,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   Early in September they left Mackinaw, for Wisconsin. After a short
   visit with an old friend, they went to Fond du Lac, where a glorious
   work began. Here he was greatly annoyed by the jealousy of the pastor.
   After vainly attempting to array the members of the church against Mr.
   Redfield, he wrote to the East to find what he could to injure his
   influence. One of the parties to whom he wrote informed Mr. Redfield of
   this. Some one communicated to this pastor some rumors of Mr.
   Redfield's old family trouble, of which the most was made. Mr. Redfield
   went to him about it, but found him in a warlike mood, and concluded to
   let it go.

   Under great temptation to give up the struggle, Mr. Redfield left this
   place with the thought of looking up a home, and engaging again in his
   profession. But his way in that direction was providentially closed up,
   and he turned again to the work of the Lord. He was engaged for a short
   time in A_____ (probably Auroraville), where he found kind friends, and
   where God came to his help in old-time power, and many were saved.

   From here he went to New London, where he found a good, kind preacher,
   but a small society, and only one, a Quakeress, to pray at the altar.
   Because of this, Mr. Redfield was led to invite forward only those who
   would do their own praying. They did come, and God blessed them with
   great power.

   From New London Mr. Redfield went to Jefferson, Wisconsin, at the
   invitation of a preacher whom he had known in the East, Rev. G. H. Fox.
   Here the Spirit of God had free course, and blessed were the results.

   While here he received the news of the grievous fall of one who had
   been a strong advocate of holiness. Several allusions in some of his
   letters which follow are explained by this.

   In a letter to the Kendall family, dated at this place, he writes:

   "Jefferson, Wisconsin, December 20, 1856.

   "My very dear Brother and Sister Kendall -- Your letter came to hand
   yesterday, confirming what I would not entertain for a moment before.
   Well, God would not let the Israelites have the body of Moses to
   worship, and, as you say, we must learn that we cannot trust in any one
   but Jesus. But oh, how I feel for _____. I cannot but believe if all
   the circumstances of the case were known, sympathy and sorrow would be
   our prevailing feelings towards him. I wrote part of a letter to him
   this morning, but after reading it over, I burned it. I will try again.
   But enough of this.

   "I am glad to hear such good news of Johnny, as to both physical and
   spiritual things. My thoughts often turn to the poor pilgrims. My heart
   almost sinks when I hear that the tried and true are being driven from
   the field, and weakening the little band who stand for the right. Shall
   the enemy yet triumph? I am more and more confirmed in the opinion I
   expressed long ago that amputation alone will save vital piety. It has
   come to this, a candidate for the presidency of the United States, in
   order to election, must guarantee the people that he will do his best
   to crush out the humanitarian spirit that inspires the abolitionists,
   and offer premiums to its opposite; and in some of our conferences
   candidates to be received into the ministry, instead of being required
   to pledge themselves to uphold the doctrines and spirit of Methodism,
   are required, virtually, to oppose them.

   "Just take a commonsense view of the facts. In contending for the
   right, some will weary of the conflict, and for the sake of peace will
   leave the field. Every instance of this will give fresh courage to the
   opponents of spiritual religion. Others will become dispirited and call
   for a cessation of the struggle, and when the little band is reduced
   small enough, they will be surrounded, and made an easy prey. To be in
   a minority is to be rebellious, while to be in the majority is to be
   loyal. You think that some already fear that you are too fond of war.
   But I ask: Have you any selfish motive in this matter? Is it to have
   your own way? Is it not because you see the cause of Christ suffering,
   and men perishing? You answer: "Yes." Well, should you not contend
   against everything that wars against Christ? Whenever the church ceases
   to be aggressive, ceases to be a conquering power, -- she loses in
   spiritual life. No! no! dear brother and sister, "contend earnestly for
   the faith once delivered to the saints." Contend, at least, until you
   are equal in zeal, faith, fidelity, and purity with the early saints;
   then if the Lord intimates that you may slack your pace, or ease up in
   your thoroughness, you will be at liberty to do so. But if you contend,
   not for an improvement, but for the right, you will have battles, and
   all manner of evil will be spoken against you. Remember, it is of small
   concern what men may think of you. The judgment day will adjust all
   wrongs. How cheering the anticipations of the words from our Father,
   "My child, you have done right." Oh, that is enough! Let us fight on.

   "This great West is famishing for the bread of life. It is all hurry
   and bustle, hastening to be rich. You can scarcely turn without running
   against a backslider. I went out early to build a fire in the church
   last evening, and in came an old backslidden Class Leader from
   Scottsville, N. Y., all broken down, and said, "Sir, this is the first
   time I have been in a church in seven years. Myself and wife, and
   children, are all backslidden. But if there is any hope for me, I want
   to get back to the Lord."

   "There is an awful spell on the whole place. Brother Fox went into a
   store the other day, and as soon as he spoke to the first man, he broke
   down and wept, and soon all in the store were affected in like manner.

   "We expect to go to Appleton about the first or the fifteenth of
   January.

   "You don't know how I want to see your faces in the flesh once more,
   and with you have another season of salvation and power. My wife is
   being greatly blessed. She is trying to do her duty. She spoke to a man
   the other day, -- one who is very prominent in the church, and had more
   piety than all the rest, -- but he became offended because of her close
   questions, and went to Brother Fox, and requested him to send us away.
   But a few nights after he was gloriously blest, and confessed clear
   down to the bottom, and now is being used mightily to break down
   others. He has forgiven Mattie.

   "The Lord knows I love you. Remember us to all the pilgrims.

   "J. W. Redfield."

   On leaving Jeffersonville, Mr. Redfield went to Waukesha, where he
   found another old friend in charge of the work, and who was willing to
   let the truth and the Holy Spirit have free course. God came in
   glorious power, and many were saved.

   Mr. Redfield now made his contemplated visit to Appleton, Wis., the
   seat of Lawrence University. This was a Methodist institution, and with
   the church, made the place a strong Methodist community. Rev. William
   McDonald, now editor of the Christian Witness of Boston, and also
   president of the National Holiness Association, was pastor of the
   church. Then, as now, he was an earnest advocate of the experience of
   entire sanctification, and boldly stood by Mr. Redfield's work. Among
   the professors in the university, was Rev. N. E Cobleigh, who
   afterwards as known as a strong man in the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   and Professor F. O. Blair, who was a student in Middletown,
   Connecticut, at the time of Mr. Redfield's great meeting there. Mrs.
   Blair was preceptress in the university, and with her husband entered
   heartily into the work of saving souls. For a long time, there had been
   a strong infidel influence in the community, and in the university an
   infidel club had been organized by some of the students. Regular
   meetings were held, and the members of the club were active in
   propagating their opinions. Christianity was unmercifully ridiculed,
   and professors of religion were subject to sneers and scoffs. Just
   before the revival opened, the faculty had forbidden the meetings of
   the club; and about the same time, Dr. Cobleigh preached a sermon in
   which he declared that personal experience was the true test, to each
   individual, of the truth and reality of the Christian religion, and
   proposed to these skeptics to make an honest test of the matter by
   believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. An invitation was then given them,
   to come forward to the altar, and several of the most prominent came.
   Of course they experienced no benefit, and they went away boasting that
   they had tested the matter, and found there was nothing to it.

   The most aggressive of these skeptics was a young South Carolinian. He
   was very intelligent and an excellent scholar. Aside from his infidel
   sentiments, he was a model young man.

   A daily prayer meeting was started in the college at the commencement
   of the revival meetings, for the benefit of the students. In one of
   these this young man arose and declared that there was not, nor could
   be such a thing as experimental religion, and that the idea was a
   delusion and a snare. Before he was fairly seated, Professor Blair
   arose and related the story of Gallileo and the priests who condemned
   him for teaching that the world moved. He described the scene: Gallileo
   recanting on his knees, but as he rises, whispering aside to a friend:
   "But it does move." He then remarked, that the truth of the gospel did
   not depend on the belief of any man or of the world of mankind. The
   meeting then went on without any further interruption.

   The revival had such an effect upon the students that from that time
   Christianity was so in the ascendency that the skeptical felt the
   atmosphere too uncongenial, and one after another dropped out from the
   college ranks and went away. Not one of that infidel club ever
   graduated from that institution.

   The young Carolinian already described was the last to go. He was a
   member of a class in mental philosophy with Professor Blair as
   instructor. One day he was called upon to recite a lesson wherein the
   author makes the statement, and lays it down as a principle, that no
   one can have any knowledge of a sensation, emotion, or feeling which he
   has never experienced. He presented the author's views clearly and
   distinctly. The professor then asked him: "Do you think that principle
   correct?"

   He answered promptly, "I do."

   "Then you think that a person who has never enjoyed religion can have
   no knowledge of that experience?"

   The infidel paused; for he saw the dilemma this placed him in, and
   remembered his words spoken in the prayer meeting. A deep crimson blush
   rushed upward from his collar over his neck and face till lost in his
   abundant hair; and then he gasped out, "I suppose not." He never
   recovered his assurance, and at the close of the term departed never to
   return. [5]

   When the summer came (1857), Mr. Redfield made his way to St. Charles,
   Illinois, again. He came in time to attend a camp meeting, held in
   June, near that place. The presiding elder, Rev. E. H. Gaunnon, was a
   good man, and stood nobly by the work. He gave Mr. Redfield the utmost
   liberty. On Friday evening he preached. A storm had driven the people
   into the tents. This was before the day of large tabernacles and rented
   tents. Each family had their own tent of their own construction; except
   when several families, or a whole society, united and occupied a very
   large one. In such a society tent, Mr. Redfield preached on perfect
   love.

   Toward the close of the sermon he used the following illustration of
   the reason so many fail to obtain it. He said: "An old lady once, on
   reading the eleventh of St. Mark before retiring for the night, said:
   "There, that is just what I want to have done. Here is this great hill
   between me and my neighbor's house. I'll just ask the Lord to take it
   away. So down upon her knees she went, and prayed accordingly. In the
   morning, as soon as it was light, she hurried to the window, and there
   stood the hill where it did before she prayed. "Well," said she, "I
   thought it would be just so." "So," said Mr. Redfield, "many pray, and
   when the answer does not come, they feel, "I thought it would be just
   so."

   The meeting closed, and most of the preachers retired to the tent
   provided for them, and went to bed. Soon one of them asked the
   question: "What do you think of the doctor's sermon?"

   "It was all right," answered another.

   "If he is right, we are all wrong," said still another.

   "If we are wrong, we had better get right," said still another.

   "I'll go at it now, if you will," said still another.

   In a few minutes they were up and dressed and on their knees in prayer.
   Soon the people from the tents were kneeling round the preachers' tent,
   on the outside, engaged in prayer; some of them for their pastors, and
   some for themselves. On past midnight this impromptu service ran. One
   after another of the preachers entered into the experience, until
   fifteen were rejoicing in its possession.

   This was the beginning of better days for the people of God in this
   section of the country. In the following winter -- 1857 -- 1858 --
   memorable as that of the great revival, these preachers, all aflame,
   entered into the work with a zeal born of the Holy Ghost, and in any
   were the victories for Christ, strong and permanent. The work in what
   was called the "Fox River region" took on a type of thoroughness and
   clearness that made the converts marked and distinct wherever they
   went. Some were called Redfieldites who had never seen or heard of Mr.
   Redfield.

CHAPTER 50

   On July 4, 1857, Mr. Redfield wrote the following letter, which
   indicates that hostility to vital godliness was becoming more intense
   and general throughout the church, and that his own long-deferred hope
   of reformation without separation was rapidly giving way:

   "My very dear Brother and Sister Kendall -- God and my own soul only
   know what drawings I feel towards you, and how it rejoices my heart to
   hear from you once more. How gladly would I go almost any distance to
   see you! Your fame has spread even to Wisconsin, and among the
   preachers you are regarded as the offscouring of the earth. Praise the
   Lord! The Buffalo and Western Advocates have put their mark upon you.
   Bless the Lord! I have shown the Medina paper, you sent me, to some of
   the preachers, and I think some of them are getting their eyes open. It
   is with much tribulation we must enter the kingdom. With my whole heart
   I can say, I believe you and those who stand with you are the
   representatives of primitive Christianity and early Methodism. My soul
   says, The Lord bless and keep you to the end. Bonds and afflictions
   await you, and every one who dares to merge every interest in God's
   will. I often inquire, Will the pilgrims hold out? or will they be
   disheartened, and finally give up the contest, and be content with
   saving themselves, and let others go to perdition? I am sure that they
   who have arrayed themselves against you will never cease their
   hostility till they put you down. If they succeed, where is the hope of
   the church? God only knows how sorrow fills my soul when I look at the
   gloomy prospect. "By whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small." Will
   Brothers McCreery, and Roberts, and Kendall, and others grow weary, and
   say, What is the use of the unequal contest? I am more than ever
   convinced that it is duty to prepare for a separate organization,
   which, if judiciously pursued, will build up a church, in the midst of
   severe persecutions, perhaps, yet a church that will bless the world,
   and compel the opponents of vital godliness to feel their deficiencies
   as now they cannot. But, of course, you know your own duty. My prayer
   is, that God may direct you.

   "It sometimes seems strange that God does not come to your rescue, if
   you are in the right; and in some unmistakable manner demonstrate that.
   But I remember that God must protect the free agency of man, and then
   hold him responsible for results. He permitted his ancient prophets to
   be slain. He permitted the papacy to clothe the church in sackcloth for
   1200 years. So it has been from the beginning, and probably will be
   until the end of time.

   "But may not great good come to them who endure, though painful it may
   be? It hurts the penitent sinner to humble down and confess his sins,
   and then accept the humble Nazarene. It hurts the convert to sacrifice
   all, and become a whole burnt offering on the altar of God, before he
   can be sanctified. It hurts to have those, who have been your friends,
   drop off one by one, because they cannot risk their reputations to
   defend you. Here we must often stand alone, with none but Jesus who
   dares to own us. We may have to stand with the Marys, and see Jesus
   wounded in the house of his friends, and be unable to help him. A word,
   or a tear, or a groan in his favor, may cause them to strike him the
   harder and deeper. They may strike you down until you seek a place of
   solitude where you may weep out your sorrow alone; but to see them
   strike your Lord, who can endure it?

   "May I say, I see all this in the distance as your cup? What if
   McCreery, and Roberts, and Hard should shrink from the bootless task,
   and strong hands should be laid on you to put you out of the
   conference? Will you and your dear wife stand for God, and trust
   Elijah's ravens for your supplies? Oh, my heart is full! May the
   suffering Jesus be with you.

   "Yours,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   The following letter, written by a personal friend, will further show
   what influences were at work in opposition to a revival of primitive
   Christianity, and will also be of interest as showing the personal
   character of the man himself.

   Mr. Kendall was serving the Chili, N. Y., circuit at this time, a
   strong country charge, and one where he had brave friends to stand by
   him.

   "CHILI, Aug. 21, 1857.

   "Dear Brother Phelps: -- Since I saw you I have been at two camp
   meetings -- on Niagara District and at Wyoming. At the former, the
   doctrine that we are entirely sanctified at conversion was boldly
   proclaimed. Brother Wm. Cooley requested me to exhort in his place, and
   set the matter right. I occupied forty-five minutes in trying to do so,
   while the Regency preachers prayed God to have mercy upon me. I felt a
   good conscience all through.

   "At Wyoming camp meeting I preached on the same subject. Brother Abell
   arose, as soon as I was through, and backed what I said. The presiding
   elder and two preachers then exhorted against me, after which Brother
   B. W. Gorham, of the Guide to Holiness, stood by me and the truth
   nobly, for which the presiding elder, as soon as the service closed,
   took him off into the woods. Some of the preachers roar against me
   "like the bulls of Bashan." I know not but they will gore me, tear the
   ground, or something, at the conference. I do not expect to remain at
   Chili. I go to conference, not knowing what will befall me there; nor
   do I trouble myself at all. Naught can harm me while I abide in Christ.

   "Your militant brother,

   "W. C. KENDALL."

   But the conspirators were already at work, plotting and planning
   against these men. When conference came, Kendall, talented, successful,
   and beloved by the humble and spiritual, was confronted by a bill of
   charges,. and only escaped trial for lack of time; then was sent to
   West Falls circuit, "the whipping post" of the conference.

   B. T. Roberts was tried on a charge of unchristian conduct, and, not
   being allowed to defend himself with testimony, was declared guilty,
   sentenced to be reprimanded by the bishop, and then sent from Albion, a
   strong station, to a country village,

   Joseph McCreery was treated in like manner.

   When the bishop concluded the reading of the appointments, for a moment
   the pilgrims hung their heads in sorrow at this manifestation of the
   bitter spirit of their persecutors. The bishop called for a verse of
   song, and Kendall, with a full and steady voice led off with:--


   "Come, on my partners in distress,

   My comrades through this wilderness,

   Who still your bodies feel;

   Awhile forget your griefs and fears,

   And look beyond this vale of tears,

   To that celestial hill."

   The bishop was about to pray, but Kendall sang on,


   "Beyond the bounds of time and space,

   Look forward to that heavenly place,

   The saints' secure abode.

   On faith's strong eagle pinions rise,

   And force your passage to the skies,

   And scale the mount of God."

   Again the bishop was about to kneel for prayer, but Brother Kendall
   continued to sing:--


   "Who suffer with our Master here,

   We shall before his face appear,

   And by his side sit down.

   To patient faith the prize is sure;

   And all that to the end endure

   The cross, shall wear the crown."

   By this time every head of the persecuted band was up, and as they sang
   they believed, and hope grew strong. Some fell to the floor; some
   shouted aloud, while Brother Kendall's voice continued still to make
   the auditorium ring with heavenly melody, as he sang:--


   "Thrice blessed bliss-inspiring hope,

   It lifts the fainting spirits up,

   It brings to life the dead.

   Our conflicts here shall soon be past,

   And you and I ascend at last,

   Triumphant with our Head.

   "That great mysterious deity,

   We soon with open face shall see

   The beatific sight,

   Shall fill the heavenly courts with praise,

   And wide diffuse the golden blaze,

   Of everlasting light."

   The bishop then prayed, the doxology was sung, the benediction
   pronounced, and the pilgrim preachers went to their appointments
   without a sigh.

   In the following letter, Mr. Kendall describes his new circuit.

   "West Falls, Erie Co., N. Y.

   "Sept. 16, 1857.

   "Dear Brother Roberts: -- I find myself on my new field. Four or five
   appointments -- no parsonage -- one prayer meeting -- some fifty or
   sixty members; and they have been giving their preacher two hundred and
   fifty dollars to live upon. The starvation system is in full blast in
   my case. I shall have a good year, however, if I have any year. One
   appointment is within ten miles of Buffalo; and I have serious thoughts
   of establishing one within the heart of the city its self. God may have
   designed, by my appointment, to pour out a vial of wrath or mercy on
   the seat of the beast. I intend to watch the openings of providence,
   and to enter them in the name of the Lord.

   "I think of you often, and fear lest you will be discouraged in view of
   the state of things. The Regency pressed you hard in LeRoy; but it was
   not you they were after, but the blessed Jesus. I never realized the
   corrupt state of our conference as when we were voting on your case.
   Such combination to crush a brother I did not suppose could be with us.
   As you said on the conference floor, "Some of us will die hard." Don't
   be discouraged, brother; we have not suffered much yet. As you said to
   me on the night of your sentence and execution, "It is an honor to be
   denounced by those men." Such bribery as they practiced is a disgrace
   to any set of men who make no pretense to religion. But I must stop, or
   my head will be off next.

   "I spent the Sabbath after conference in LeRoy. Brother _____ asked me
   to preach, after consultation with A. P. R., and to preach the first
   sermon. I had a very good time. The Lord blessed me. I have no doubt
   that he willed that I should spend that day in LeRoy. McE_____. invited
   Mrs. K. and myself home to dinner with him, and treated me as
   respectfully as he knew how. Brother Shepard, a Class Leader, said in
   class that he did not know the brother who preached; but if that was
   Nazaritism, he was a Nazarite. R_____. cautioned the people to "beware
   of troublers." Brother Colton was very friendly. Brother Anderson, just
   as McE_____ was about to pronounce the benediction, cried out, "Brother
   Kendall will preach in the Congregational church at five o'clock, the
   Lord willing." The house was well filled, and we had another good time,
   and followed the sermon with a sort of love-feast. The N_____s are
   becoming popular in LeRoy.

   "I expect you, Brother McC_____. and Brother Cooley will see to the
   pilgrims in that northern region. Brother Colton said, on Monday
   morning, as I was about to leave, that he thought Brother Roberts and
   myself ought to go through the conference holding meetings. Indeed, I
   was almost persuaded, as they did not locate me, to locate myself, and
   be free to go everywhere, preaching Jesus. We must circulate, as much
   as possible, among the people. God will give us this land yet. I give
   the Regency fair warning, the Lord helping, I will do my duty to them
   this year. My address is as above. Write if you have a mind.

   "Yours, through the war,

   "W. C. KENDALL."

   On Nov. 5, Mr. Kendall also wrote in another letter as follows:

   "Dear Brother Phelps: -- You speak of our being scattered, and exhort
   me to keep up courage. I have no doubt that it is as I told some of my
   people; I was sent here to be whipped and starved, but I don't expect
   to receive either. I have five appointments, and preach three times
   each Sabbath. There is no pastor of any denomination -- living within
   the bounds of my parish. I preach in four comfortable meeting houses --
   two of them Methodist, one Union; the fourth is owned by twelve
   sinners. Abundance of work -- scarcely any religion, only one choir to
   bother. No revival has been here for years. My health is good -- my
   courage, also.

   "We have just had our first quarterly meeting -- a very good season.
   One soul soundly converted -- a little of the first fruits. A few were
   a little displeased on finding the door closed, they being late to
   love-feast. The love-feast was a blessed season. Many saw the benefit
   of the Methodist rule.

   "Your brother to the end of the war,

   "W. C. KENDALL."

   This was Mr. Kendall's last appointment. In the midst of a glorious
   revival, he sickened and died. His death was one of the most
   triumphant. A short time before his departure, he said: "I've been
   swimming for two days in the waters of death, and they are like sweet
   incense all over me." Waving his hands in holy triumph, he repeated the
   lines:-


   "Bright angels are from glory come;

   They're round my bed,

   they're in my room;

   They wait to waft my spirit home-

   All is well,"

   and passed away to that better land, where "the wicked cease from
   troubling and the weary are at rest."

   The day of his funeral the pilgrim preachers gathered around his
   remains, and clasping hands above them, vowed fidelity to God.

   It is said of this blessed man, that he was one of nature's noblemen in
   every way. A large, strong body, a frank and noble face -- the radiance
   of which has smitten sinners with conviction -- broad and
   well-cultivated mind, and a large heart. To know him was to love him;
   to be with him, was to be rebuked for sin, and to be moved towards
   Christ. Joyous, buoyant, faithful, untiring in zeal, he wrought amid
   fierce persecutions which followed him to the grave. His friends were
   of the choicest, purest, the most devoted. His enemies were the
   worldly, the carnal, the time-serving, and the untrue. His bitterest
   enemies fought him while he lived, and eulogized him after he was dead.

   The venerable Father Coleman once said to the writer: "I knew him; and
   such a face as his I never saw before. I think he was the sweetest,
   faithful man I ever knew."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 51

   In December, 1857, we find Mr. Redfield in St. Charles, Illinois,
   again, endeavoring to break through the crust of which he spoke in a
   former letter; but for some reason, never explained, he was unable to
   reach the signal victory here, which he experienced in other places. A
   few were saved, the pilgrims strengthened, while those in the church
   who resisted the light, settled into a deeper hostility to the doctrine
   and experience of holiness.

   On the 21st of December, he wrote a letter to Brother and Sister
   Kendall, of which the following is a copy:

   "St. Charles, Ill.

   "My dear Brother and Sister Kendall: -- We received your very welcome
   letter before we started for this place. How glad we were once more to
   hear from you! We had heard from you and many of the pilgrims through
   Brother J. D. R_____., a few weeks ago; and now and then we get a
   little information through Eastern papers, which give us a little clue
   of what is going on. But we want to see you, if the Lord permit.

   "We are now on our way to a southern clime -- Texas, probably -- where
   we wish if possible to find a place for a colony, where we can
   establish a type of salvation which will live. We think that not less
   than one hundred and fifty to two hundred will go between this spring
   and next fall. Among them will be a number of preachers, and most of
   the remainder will be Methodists. We shall only invite those who have a
   living religion. I go to select, if I can, from ten to fifty thousand
   acres of land, in a body in some eligible location, this to be
   distributed among the colonists. A prominent object is to get a
   location where invalids like Mattie will be likely to gain health, more
   surely than in northern latitudes. What information I have with respect
   to Texas is, the climate is most delightful, fully equal to the best
   portions of California.

   "We have been holding meetings here, and have seen some as powerful
   conversions as I ever knew. But our plow has run into some old roots,
   of from five to twenty years old. We tugged, and ground, put on more
   team, and cut our way through, until some thought we had got through
   all. But I think there is more yet, and may be worse than any we have
   yet seen. Whether we can force our way clear through is more than I can
   tell. Mattie is afraid to have me press it through, but I have no fears
   for myself, and would sooner run under than leave the work half done.
   How we shall succeed remains to be seen.

   "We expect to leave here by the middle of January, and I wish to hear
   from you once more before then.

   "Yours in love,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   An appendix to this letter, written by Mrs. Redfield, says they had
   been in St. Charles three weeks. God had been with them in power. Quite
   a number had been converted. She refers to the troubles, and thinks the
   preacher in charge ought to take hold of them, and not leave so much
   for Mr. Redfield.

   This preacher in charge was Rev. Charles French, a good man, who loved
   God and the truth, and was in hearty sympathy with an earnest
   salvation. He remained a firm friend to Mr. Redfield for years.

   How soon the visionary scheme, described by him in the last letter was
   given up, there is nothing to show; but this is the first and the last
   trace of it to be found.

   About the first of January he went to Elgin, Illinois. The pastor was
   Rev. C. M. Woodward, who knew many of the ministers in the Genesee
   Conference, of which he had been a member. He knew much of Mr.
   Redfield's work in the East, and was prepared to receive him here. The
   notion that it was best to keep the control of the services in his own
   hands, as preacher in charge, was somewhat in Mr. Redfield's way, as
   the latter's experience in revival work enabled him to surmount
   difficulties, where others knew not what to do. In this meeting Mr.
   Redfield did the preaching and invited seekers to the altar, but Mr.
   Woodward managed the prayer service. Mr. Redfield's success was due
   largely to his skillful management of seekers at the altar.

   The work moved slowly at first, but after a little, it began to take
   hold of the membership. Quite a number of them entered into the
   experience of perfect love. But there was no general break among
   sinners.

   While engaged at Elgin, Mr. Redfield was visited by Mr. M. L. Hart, of
   Marengo, a village twenty-five miles away, at the instance of the
   official board of the Methodist Church, to request him to assist in a
   revival at that place. Mr. and Mrs. Hart had been somewhat acquainted
   with Mr. Redfield's labors in the East, and when they heard of his
   being in Elgin, they recommended him to the Marengo church. He
   consented to go, on condition that the official board would allow him
   the liberty to preach according to the Bible and the Methodist
   Discipline. On Mr. Hart's return, a meeting of the board was called,
   and a motion to invite Mr. Redfield on his own conditions was
   unanimously adopted. Mr. Redfield on learning of this determined to go
   as soon as he could leave Elgin. In the midst of this he received a
   telegram as he entered the church one Saturday evening, that his
   friend, William C. Kendall, was lying at the point of death. After the
   service Sunday night he wrote the following letter:

   "ELGIN, Ill., 12:30, Sunday Night.

   "My dear Brother and Sister Kendall: -- I received your dispatch while
   going into church last night. And as there was no mail or train until
   Monday afternoon, it afforded me time to think and pray over the
   matter. Brother Woodward had already left for Marengo, to fill my
   appointment there until I came, that I might stay here over the
   Sabbath. I laid the matter before the Lord last night, and in great
   distress of mind, I asked: "What shall I do?" When I thought of the
   work of God, and of your sickness, I said: "We cannot spare Brother
   Kendall." Then I said: "Lord, tell me which way I shall go"; and a
   sweet, blessed influence came over me, which seemed to say: "You attend
   to God's business, and he will attend to Brother Kendall better than
   you can." And I feel at perfect rest when I trust Brother Kendall in
   his hands.

   "Elgin has about 3,000 people, and it is said they have never known
   such power as we have in our meetings. And there is a fear that if I
   leave it will go down. This night we have had one of the most awful and
   glorious times. The straight way of holiness has most signally
   triumphed. Tomorrow I must go to Marengo, about twenty-five miles from
   here. The preacher there is used up, can preach no more, and must have
   help. Here they are pressing me to stay. There they say I may go the
   straight way. There are also two other places awaiting me; one twenty
   miles south, and the other at Galena, a city of 10,000 or 12,000
   people. Amid these calls and promises to let God have a fair chance,
   together with what we now have, you may well judge of the rack on which
   my mind was cast by your dispatch.

   "All I can get from the Lord is: "Keep at work, and I'll take care of
   Brother Kendall." I fear to get out of God's order, and it seems to me
   to be his order that I confine my labors at present to Marengo and
   Elgin. I feel at rest about you, some way. You know I had got started
   for the South, but as this door opened, I felt I must risk Mattie's
   health, and she is now better. This, to me, is another evidence that I
   am in the right field for the present.

   "You did not state what is the matter with Brother Kendall. Write to me
   at Marengo.

   "I feel wonderfully at rest in regard to Brother Kendall. It doesn't
   seem as though the Lord would take him to glory yet. I could die for
   him, and nothing but the strong impression of duty keeps me here. If it
   were not for that, I would take the first train to come to you.

   "Glory to God, all is well. Hallelujah!

   J. W. Redfield."

   When Mr. Redfield arrived at Marengo, he had an opportunity to listen
   to the religious testimonies of some of the membership, and saw that it
   would take very thorough work to give the stamp of piety that was
   needed in that place. It was also evident that a large portion of those
   who had professed to be converted knew but little about religious
   experience. In his first sermon he endeavored to show that it was the
   privilege of Christians to live in the land of Beulah constantly. This
   so shocked some of the membership that they could scarcely endure him
   from that time. One member of the official board has informed the
   writer, that if it had not been for the pledge that they would let Mr.
   Redfield go straight on the Bible and Discipline, it would have been
   difficult to have gained their consent to let him continue. They never
   had heard the truth presented in that way before.

   General Superintendent E. P. Hart, of the Free Methodist Church, son of
   the M. L. Hart who bore the request to Mr. Redfield to come to Marengo,
   says:

   "I had professed religion during the meetings that had been held
   previous to the Doctor's coming, but I knew scarcely anything of real
   religion. I had heard father and mother speak of the Doctor in such
   strong terms, and such wonderful reports had come to us of the meetings
   at Elgin, that I was full of expectation of listening to marvelous
   eloquence. I went to a friend and relative of mine, a lawyer by the
   name of Rogers, and invited him to go with me and listen to the
   wonderful man. I became very anxious that Rogers should be favorably
   impressed, and remarked as we approached the church, "He may be a
   little embarrassed to night, as he is a total stranger, and may not do
   as well as when he becomes better acquainted." When we got inside the
   church, I found it very difficult to get Rogers a seat, and was obliged
   to take one of the pulpit steps for myself. As soon as the Doctor
   commenced, I forgot all about Rogers. My hopes of heaven were all swept
   away by the truth, and from that time I could not conscientiously
   profess religion. The Doctor had taken tea at our house, and now went
   home with us to tarry for the night. As soon as we had got seated
   around the stove, after our return, he asked me how I enjoyed the
   meeting. I replied, "Oh, very well; I am not used to quite so much
   noise."

   "My brother," said he, "has the Lord made you ear inspector of this
   community?'

   "This settled me, as far as that was concerned, but I did not get out
   into a good experience until long after the protracted meeting closed."

   This revival swept the town and the surrounding country. People came
   from five to twenty miles in their own conveyances, and often the house
   would be well filled an hour and a half before the time for service.
   Many were converted in their wagons on their way home. The number
   converted has been estimated at from four to five hundred. Every
   whiskey shop in the place was closed, and many of the worst of people
   were converted. Large numbers were entirely sanctified, and a light was
   kindled that has never gone out. Many have died, who were saved in that
   meeting, who honored God while they lived, and who triumphed gloriously
   in their last moments.

   Among the many trophies of divine grace was that of the village
   drayman, a man by the name of Boyington. He was very wicked and
   blasphemous. When he was saved he became more remarkable for his piety.
   Endowed with remarkable good sense, and with a quaintness of expression
   peculiarly his own, he was always interesting, whether in private
   conversation, or in public testimony. He lived for about twenty-five
   years, a monument of mercy, and then fell asleep in Jesus.

   A physician by the name of Richardson entered into the experience of
   perfect love, and though rejected by the conference, when he applied
   for work, was taken to Minnesota, by a visiting presiding elder, [6]
   and given employment. He became very successful, and was made a great
   blessing to the church and the world.

   As at St. Charles, so here, there were a number of deeply experienced
   Christians, who quickly recognized the work of God, and who rallied
   around Mr. Redfield, and gave great aid to the work. One of these was
   "Mother Cobb," who for many years was the only living witness to the
   experience of perfect love in all those parts. She had then walked in
   the steady light of it for more than forty years. She lived for nearly
   twenty more in the light of that experience, when God took her home.
   Another was, "Mother Combs," a woman of deep piety, clear
   understanding, and consistent life. Another was, the mother of
   Superintendent Hart. She had been led into the experience by Rev. James
   Caughey.

   The pastor of the church was no help to the work, and providentially
   kept away. Soon after the close of the meeting he was arraigned before
   the presiding elder on a charge of drunkenness. He soon after went to
   one of the frontier states and engaged in the practice of law.

   One of the results of this meeting was the starting of a Monday evening
   holiness meeting at the home of a brother Bishop, several miles out in
   the country, that was sustained through summer and winter for several
   years. It was nothing unusual for people to come from six to nine miles
   to that meeting, and return the same night. Many were converted and
   many were sanctified in those meetings.

   During this revival meeting, the news came of the death of Mr. Kendall.
   The following is Mr. R_____ 's letter of condolence to Mrs. Kendall:

   "Marengo, Ill., Feb. 22, 1858.

   "My dear Sister Kendall -- I cannot realize that our dear fellow
   laborer is really reaping his reward in heaven. I could not make it
   seem possible, that one so faithful, and so honored of God, could be
   spared. I did not feel that God would take him so soon. But there must
   have been the best of reasons why our heavenly Father took him up to
   the society of the glorified. He is now associated with the sainted
   Fletcher, whom he much resembled. Brother Kendall's face came up before
   me in a remarkable manner two or three hours before I received your
   dispatch, and during the evening after. I deeply mourn with you over
   your loss. I am persuaded that angels are rejoicing over his arrival
   among them. I pray that his mantle may fall on me. From Sister S_____'s
   letter, I judge that he was past help when I received your first
   dispatch; or, at least, would have been before I could have reached
   him.

   "Like Mrs. Fletcher, you may tarry behind to do much for God. You now
   realize, as never before, the power of religion. Yours is a hot
   furnace, but remember the white robed throng came up out of great
   tribulation. I try to make your case my own, and often fear, should I
   be called to see my best earthly friend laid in the cold grave, that I
   could never smile again. God and my own heart only know what a jewel I
   have, and I fear I have not religion enough to sustain me in such a
   calamity. But I may go first. I do not allow myself to think of it, but
   keep to work, and trust that he who has called me, if I am faithful,
   will sustain me in that awful hour, whether she or I go first. If you
   could only be with us here, God would make you a great blessing, and I
   am sure that he and your sainted husband would be pleased with your
   labors. Be as cheerful as you can; you will have friends below as well
   as above.

   "Yours affectionately,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   In another letter to Sister Kendall, written about the same time, after
   discussing the idea of the departed being ministering spirits to their
   friends here, the idea of which he somewhat favored, he wrote thus of
   Brother Kendall:

   "I always felt, and do now, a kind of inspiration to say: "Blessed,
   persecuted, faithful man!" While he lived, God had one man that would
   not swerve a hair's breadth from the exact right. Yes, God had one man
   in the old Genesee Conference that could be trusted in any place; who
   in the darkest night of discouragement was at his post. Yes, blessed
   saint! Glory be to God, that I ever saw him! I feel the inspiration of
   his faithful spirit. I never felt so strong in God, and so firm to
   stand up for the exact right as I have since he, like an Elijah, has
   gone on before. It seems to me he is commissioned to infuse his own
   daring, faithful spirit into those who are ready to halt. I praise God
   that he ever lived. I sometimes relate his experiences, persecutions,
   and triumphs, to my congregations, and always with good effect. He is
   now above the reach of flattery, and I can say what is in my heart,
   "Well done, good and faithful servant." I may yet drink of his bitter
   cup, but shall I ever be with him and see his glory? In imagination I
   can see him, on the occasion of which you wrote, when he was so grieved
   to think he stood so alone for God; and in my inner heart I say: "Well
   done, blessed man."

   "J. W. Redfield:"

   Mr. Redfield was pained at one thing in connection with his work in
   Marengo -- the want of care with respect to the results of the meeting.
   He says: "Could the Methodist Church have been persuaded to take care
   of the work, rather than to contend against it, it might have spread
   farther, and a more glorious harvest have been reaped." The presiding
   elder could but endorse the character of the work, but thought in the
   end it would work harm, as it would be impossible to supply it with
   preachers who would be acceptable to the people -- that is, it was
   unfortunate to have such a revival, because there were so few preachers
   in the conference who were in sympathy with it.

CHAPTER 52

   From Marengo, Mr. Redfield went to Woodstock, the county seat, twelve
   miles distant. Here he found the Methodist society weak, and
   worshipping in a hired hall. Quite a number of the newly saved, from
   various places, gathered here to assist in the meetings.

   Among them was C. E. Harroun, spoken of in the account of the St.
   Charles meeting. Mr. Redfield's manner and matter in preaching were new
   to the people, and as usual drew large crowds to hear him. The
   curiosity of the masses, the cold indifference of the church, and the
   hesitating, doubtful policy of the pastor, for a time made the effort
   for a revival very hard. One brother, from Marengo, who had experienced
   the holy baptism, while engaged in prayer at the altar, suddenly was
   without voice or thoughts. Having never had such an experience before,
   he was filled with surprise, and looked about him in amazement. With
   Mr. Redfield this was no new thing, and fully aware of the feelings of
   the brother, he shouted a word of encouragement, and soon all was
   right. Inquiry showed that all the rest of the praying ones had a
   similar experience at the same time. It was but one of those onsets of
   the powers of darkness often met by those engaged in evangelistic work.
   The writer remembers an instance of the kind, during Mr. Redfield's
   labors in Elgin. A sudden hush came upon the meeting. Every voice at
   the altar was silenced, and soon the congregation was boisterous with
   merriment. Mr. Redfield, standing in front of the pulpit, suddenly
   stamped his right foot, and at the top of his voice cried out, "Lord,
   smite the devil." In an instant, the merriment in the congregation
   ceased, and every praying one broke out in loud supplication, which
   lasted for some moments, when the praying was turned to praising, and
   the noise of the latter equaled that of the former. For such
   emergencies Mr. Redfield seemed especially endowed. At Woodstock,
   determined opposition set in against the work. At first the Baptist and
   the Presbyterian ministers appointed a union prayer meeting and invited
   both the Universalist preacher and Mr. Redfield to attend it. Mr.
   Redfield saw that it was an attempt to crowd him into a position where
   he would be misunderstood by the people; that is, where he would be
   obliged to refuse to attend the meeting because of the liberty given
   the Universalist minister. They well knew this from what they had heard
   and observed of his preaching. But if he refused to accept of their
   invitation, they would charge him with uncharitableness, and that with
   apparent grounds for it. But he met it squarely, by answering, "No! I
   have no fellowship with infidels." He then spoke plainly of what he
   considered the design of the thing.

   Then an eminent minister, living at a distance, was sent for, to preach
   in one of the churches, and that failed. Then a prominent member was
   found standing at the entrance of the hall one night, asking persons if
   they were not ashamed to be seen at a Methodist meeting; and that
   failed. Then threatening letters were sent to Mr. Redfield, and that
   failed. Then a band of roughs congregated together, and pledged
   themselves to each other to mob Mr. Redfield, and he was guarded to and
   from the hall a number of nights. A dentist, an old Methodist
   backslider, by the name of Murphy, a man of great physical strength and
   daring, was his principal escort. But one night nearly every one of
   this gang was at the altar crying for mercy; and so that scheme failed.
   Then reports began to be circulated that Mr. Redfield was a gambler,
   and a drinking man. Some men went so far as to say that they had seen
   him engaged in both; but that failed. The Universalist preacher was
   annoyed by so many of his flock attending the meetings at the hall, and
   asked them: "Why do you go there?"

   "To hear Redfield preach holiness," was their answer.

   "Well, if that is your reason, I can preach holiness," he replied; and
   he attempted to do so.

   But all this failed to stop the work.

   One night, after an ineffectual effort to preach, Mr. Redfield said to
   the congregation: "I have been trying for two weeks to preach to you
   the truth. For some reason it does not do its work as it should." He
   then turned to the pastor, who sat in the pulpit with him, and asked:

   "How long is it since you joined the conference in full connection?"

   "Fourteen years," was the answer.

   "Did you not say then you were earnestly groaning for full redemption?"

   "I did."

   "Are you any nearer to it tonight than you were then?"

   "No, sir."

   "Don't you see that something is wrong?"

   "I do."

   "Will you get right?"

   "I will."

   "Will you go forward right here, and now, and on the seekers' side of
   the altar, and seek it?"

   "I will," said the now deeply-moved pastor, and immediately left the
   pulpit and knelt on the outside of the altar.

   With a scream, a woman, a member of the church, some distance, back
   from the altar, sprang to her feet, and came running, and knelt by her
   pastor's side, and in a loud voice said, "O Brother B_____, you said I
   need not take off this jewelry; that it was no matter if my heart was
   only right. O Brother B_____, you have stood right in my way." At this,
   a number more ran to the altar.

   That night the work broke. The revival swept the town and the
   surrounding country. Every county officer, including the sheriff and
   the judge, nearly every lawyer, and many other prominent men, were
   converted. One lawyer became a traveling preacher in the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, and the sheriff became a useful local preacher. The
   next fall, the conference sent Rev. Joseph Hartwell, a sound Methodist,
   and one who enjoyed and preached holiness, to supply the pulpit, and
   the weak society became strong and vigorous.

   Before leaving Woodstock, Mr. Redfield had one of his old signs again;
   and he said to his wife one day, "Mattie, we'll have to spend the
   winter in St. Louis." For more than twenty years he had felt he had a
   work to do in that region, although the precise place was not made
   known to him until now. The more he considered the matter, the more he
   became satisfied that duty led him there, and he planned his work
   accordingly. He did not go to St. Louis immediately, but made his visit
   there at a later date, as we shall hereafter see.

   His successes at Marengo and Woodstock, and encouraging reports from
   Western New York, cheered his heart, and gave him courage to drive the
   battle on.

   From Woodstock, Mr. Redfield went to a country church, on Queen Anne
   prairie, a few miles away. Here God poured out his Spirit also, and
   many were raised up to testify to the power of the cleansing blood.
   Some of these have gone to their reward, while others are still
   contending for the faith.

   When in June, the St. Charles camp meeting came on, there was a host of
   witnesses to perfect love, from Aurora, St. Charles, Elgin, Marengo,
   Woodstock, Queen Anne, and other places, reached indirectly by Mr.
   Redfield's labors. What power there was in the services! with what
   unction the witnesses spoke and prayed! It was the writer's first camp
   meeting, and all its scenes and events are still vivid to his memory.

   Again, Elder Gammon gave Mr. Redfield great liberty, and entire
   sanctification was the theme of the meeting. But the last day the Rev.
   C. P. Bragdon, the minister alluded to in another chapter, who preached
   the sermon, when Purdy saved the day so gloriously; this man preached
   the same sermon here. His text was:

   "Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost."

   The first part of the sermon was anti-rum; the second part was
   anti-tobacco; and the third part was anti-holiness. In the last he set
   forth the idea that all the experience a believer had after his
   conversion, is growth in grace. The experience of entire sanctification
   as a second experience, was ridiculed and denied. This was the first
   manifestation of hostility to the doctrine and experience among the
   Methodists of Fox River valley; but it was only the beginning of what
   proved afterward the occasion of division in the church.

   Elder Gammon desired Mr. Redfield to preach in the afternoon after Mr.
   B_____'s strange discourse. But he replied: "I shall have to meet the
   false doctrine of this forenoon, if I do."

   "But," said the elder, "it would hardly do to have any controversy on
   the campground."

   So Mr. Redfield did not preach.

CHAPTER 53

   Soon after the St. Charles camp meeting, Mr. Redfield made a visit to
   Western New York. At Pekin, in Niagara County, he found a general
   quarterly meeting, the first of the kind he had ever attended. Here he
   met with preachers and laymen from afar, who had gathered to wait upon
   God for baptisms of power for the Lord's work. His heart was cheered
   with their boldness and freedom, and unction. He remembered his hours
   of sadness and lamentation over the thought that so much of his work
   had been destroyed, by the opposition to primitive Methodism in the
   church. But here he looked upon and heard many who had been brought
   into the light through his labors in various parts of the country. He
   found that the work had been kept alive in some places, by the
   organization of bands, made up of those who enjoyed perfect love and
   were contending earnestly for real Methodism. He told them of his
   labors in the West, where, and when, and with what results; of the
   oppositions and the encouragements he had met. He thought he saw that
   these brethren were sure of one of two things: either they would win
   the people to Methodism in such numbers that those in power in the
   church would not dare to molest them; or they would be finally excluded
   from the church That very fall, but a few months after this, the work
   of expulsion commenced. Mr. Roberts and Mr. McCreery were expelled from
   the conference and the church.

   Soon after this meeting, Mr. Redfield returned to Illinois, and, August
   25, he wrote to Mrs. Kendall as follows:

   "My dear Sister Kendall: -- I have much to say and little time in which
   to say it. Salvation is our only theme. The strife against it has
   begun, but the pilgrims in these parts hold on as yet, and seem
   resolved to maintain their stand.

   B_____ has made himself very busy in opposing it, but has lost caste
   with many for his trouble. I hear that the people where he was last
   year refuse to have him returned. I keep scattering the tracts and
   pamphlets. The more the pilgrims here learn of the pilgrims there, the
   more they love them. I am accused of 'splitting churches." I confess
   that is my object to split them off from the world. But many good
   people, and some of the preachers here, are very much prejudiced
   against you. Brother Woodward (formerly of the Genesee Conference) says
   he cannot believe all is right among the pilgrims when such men as
   Fillmore, and Church and De Puy, and Bowman, represent them as they do.
   I learn that De Puy and Bowman [7] are to emigrate to this country this
   year. May the Lord have mercy on us if they do.

   "Mattie's health has been very poor of late, and we think of going to
   Missouri and Kansas about the 20th of September. I wish you could go
   with us.

   "How goes the great work at West Falls? and how among the pilgrims? I
   shall look with great interest to the coming session of the Genesee
   Conference. Don't fail to inform me of all that occurs. Mattie reads
   your letters to the pilgrims here, wherever we go, and they set them
   all on fire for the work.

   "That was a remarkable scene you described, when those two preachers
   thought they saw the sainted Kendall. Oh, how my heart leaps when I
   think of his fidelity, purity, and zeal! I know he was right. How the
   breaking of the last seal will let a flood of light upon his
   adversaries! Then will they confess: "O William, you were right, and we
   were wrong." My heart continually asks: Who will take up his burden and
   testimony, where he laid them down? Blessed man! Redeemed saint! I am
   sure he now dwells forever above the strife of tongues.

   "Remember me to Brother and Sister Roberts, and all the pilgrims.

   "J. W. Redfield."

   About this time was held the last quarterly meeting for the Elgin
   charge, and in the quarterly conference, of which the writer was a
   member and present at the time, the license of Mr. Redfield as a local
   preacher was renewed without any opposition. He was also given a
   written recommendation as a revivalist. Mr. Redfield was not present
   when this was done.

   About the same time he attended a camp meeting at Coral, near Marengo,
   where he labored with great power. This meeting was under the
   management of Rev. Hooper Crews, presiding elder of Rockford district.
   Mr. Crews was an excellent preacher, of sweet spirit, and manifestly
   very sincere; but, at the same time, little calculated for leadership
   against tumultuous opposition. He had already expressed his fears as to
   being able to furnish preachers who would be acceptable to societies
   where Mr. Redfield had successfully labored. On Sunday morning of this
   camp meeting, in his sermon, he made this allusion to his experience:

   "If I ever experienced entire sanctification, it was when 1 was
   converted, for I have been happy ever since."

   So strong was the influence of the doctrine and experience of holiness
   at this camp meeting, that every minister was compelled to recognize it
   in his sermons and testimonies. Here were the fruits of Mr. Redfield's
   labors in the great meetings he had held at the places heretofore
   described; and any minister not in sympathy with the doctrine of
   holiness was in a very embarrassing position.

   Mr. Redfield preached in the afternoon of Sunday with great power, and
   multitudes were at the altar seeking. So great was the interest that he
   held a second altar service about five o'clock, when perhaps one
   hundred were forward seeking. This meeting was led in his
   characteristic way. After opening with singing and prayer, he gave a
   half-hour's talk on the way of salvation. In this he pointed out
   clearly and distinctly the successive steps each seeker must take to
   find salvation. While dwelling upon this, he explained the seeming
   confusion of many in regard to the experience of entire sanctification
   being a second work, and then remarked, "That is what ails your
   presiding elder."

   Brother Crews sat immediately behind him, and was deeply moved by the
   remark.

   When the invitation was given for seekers, there was a rush. They
   commenced praying aloud, and all at once, and in about fifteen minutes
   the prayer meeting was ended. Nearly all had entered into the
   experience. This service was a revelation to a large number of
   ministers present, as they never had seen anything on that wise before.
   Immediately after the service the presiding elder took Mr. Redfield
   aside for a plain, close conversation on the subject of sanctification.
   That conversation resulted in the presiding elder's entering into the
   experience, a few weeks afterward in a prayer meeting in Rockford. But,
   from not confessing it fully, he soon after lost it. He found and lost
   it three times during the following year; and finally at a camp meeting
   held in the northern part of his district the following year, he went
   to the altar like a little boy, was labored with by the laymen and the
   sisters of his district, and while looking at one of the promises of
   God, in an open Bible, held before him by an eccentric minister by the
   name of Irving, and asked if he believed it, with a scream of joy he
   sprang to his feet, and seeing his wife at a distance, he ran speedily
   to her, caught her in his arms, and ran about the camp ground like a
   deer, shouting, "Hallelujah!" at every bound. From that time Hooper
   Crews preached, and enjoyed and lived be blessed experience.

   Soon after this camp meeting Mr. Redfield began to get ready to go to
   St. Louis. At the same time he became greatly tempted about going. For
   several days this lasted, during which Mrs. Redfield advised against
   going, and finally determined she would not go. But during a season of
   prayer at the house of a friend, they both obtained the victory, and
   went forward cheerfully to their work.

   On their way to St. Louis they stopped for a few days at St. Charles.
   While here, an effort was made by his friends to have him hold a few
   meetings. The official board of the church was called together, and a
   petition, signed by a large number of the membership, asking that Mr.
   Redfield be invited to hold revival services, was laid before it. The
   preacher was a new man, and for some reason was unwilling to work with
   Mr. Redfield. When the vote was taken on granting the petition, nine
   were in favor of it, and five opposed. But such was the opposition of
   the five that the majority offered to leave the matter to the pastor,
   and he decided against it.

   While waiting here, he wrote the following letter:

   "St. Charles, Ill., October 7, 1858.

   "Dear Sister Kendall: -- We cannot tell you in words how highly we
   prize your very welcome letters, giving the details of the events
   taking place in Western N. Y. We are with you heart and soul, and the
   evidence you give us of your resolve to keep the narrow, steep, thorny,
   and disgraced way, fires us with new resolves to urge, press, and fight
   for the same. Mattie reads and rereads your letters to the weeping
   pilgrims who sympathize with the pilgrims of the East, and who vow anew
   to go on in the narrowest of the narrow way. How it moved our hearts
   when she read of that camp meeting, where your husband's brother
   accepted his mantle and his cross. How the scenes of the past, when
   that sainted man, the personification of fidelity, walked forth to lead
   the battle on, regardless of foes, or the odds against him. One motive,
   one thought, alone consumed him, and that was to battle for the right.
   When I think of him, my heart vows anew to go the same despised way.
   How like vapor appear the opinions of all men! What a death was his!
   Shall I die like him? Will Jesus say to me "Well done?' Oh, this
   salvation that saves is the only thing that will bear the test at last!

   "Mattie has written to you of the camp meeting. Oh, how soul cheering
   it was to see the multitudes who were saved last winter still battling
   manfully for God!

   "We expect by week after next to be on our way to St. Louis, where if
   the Lord permits, we mean to press the gospel which divides households,
   and splits dead churches off from the world. We need the baptism of
   fire for our work, and expect it, too. Bless the Lord!

   "The fire is spreading in this region rapidly, but the fight will yet
   come, and the pilgrims here, who read with avidity the history and
   doings of the pilgrims there, and who deeply sympathize with you, will
   have need that others sympathize with them. Many pretty good Christians
   who have not been through the hottest furnaces must remain too gross to
   appreciate that blessed freedom and faith which dare to let God's
   Spirit impel them to act out heaven's simplicity. We will bear with
   them, but let no one beguile us of the precious freedom to act out, as
   well as shout out, glory. I know it shocks their sense of propriety.
   But, thank God, I feel that heaven's propriety is full as rational as
   ours. Could men see that the unknown glory which cannot find outlet in
   words must have other avenues of egress to reach the gross heart of the
   dumb world; could they but realize that heaven's blessedness is
   designed for man's every pleasurable emotion, and that the
   manifestations of these emotions are the only means by which it can be
   understood, they would see the profoundest philosophy in tears, smiles,
   shouting, screams, and jumping.

   "My dear sister, Jesus has made you free. You may be a gazing stock to
   men, but remember you are also to the innumerable company. Your name
   may be cast out as evil, but they cannot reach high enough to tarnish
   it on the pillars of heaven. Of course you will be called foolish,
   crazy, nervous; but I am persuaded that you long ago passed those
   chained lions. Some people will not believe, some will feel a pious
   concern for the cause of religion; but if God desires to make you one
   end of salvation's telegraph line, to make known what is going on in
   the London of Paradise, let him have his way. From the depths of my
   soul I say go on in the name of the Lord.

   J. W. Redfield."

   October 31, he wrote again as follows:

   "St. Charles, Ill.

   "My dear Sister Kendall: -- We have been watching the mails daily
   hoping to hear from you again. We last night received information of
   the doings of the Genesee Conference -- at least enough -- for us to
   see what disposition was made of Brothers Roberts and McCreery. I must
   confess I did not expect all that. I knew well enough what some of the
   preachers desired, but I thought they feared the people too much to go
   to such an extreme. It looks now as though Brother Kendall had been
   taken from the evil that was to come. I have been sorely tempted and
   tried over such conduct in the conference preachers.

   "We had a little gathering at the house where we are now stopping, and
   Mattie read to us your letter describing the Bergen camp meeting, and
   we all had a weeping and rejoicing time, and renewed our vows to keep
   the narrow way.

   "The people here have been negotiating for us to stay and hold another
   meeting before we go south, but I have no hope that it will be
   permitted. There are four fighters in this church of one hundred and
   sixty members, and I will not make another attempt, unless they will
   stop the "fiddle", and pledge themselves to go the straight religion
   necessary to meet the judgment. Some are discouraged, and say "Let us
   start a salvation church." But that will not work, for all opposers
   will then feel themselves at liberty to manufacture what testimony they
   please to put us down.

   "What will the people do in your region about the expulsion of Brothers
   Roberts and McCreery. I expect under the excitement of the hour some
   strong resolutions will be passed, and many sharp things will be said;
   but will the pilgrims move forward in the good work, in a proper
   spirit? or will they be frightened at the usage of these two men? Like
   your sainted husband, I sing,

   "I belong to this band, Hallelujah!"

   "I only wish I was worthy to suffer with them.

   "The friends of the Eastern pilgrims are increasing here in the West.
   We must make the most of our opportunities now to spread Methodism over
   the vast fields about us.

   "If the church here does not take the stand for the straight way, we
   shall leave soon for our southern tour. We expected to have been off
   before this time, but Mattie's health and some unfinished business have
   hitherto prevented. But we hope by the 10th or 15th of next month, at
   most, to be on our way.

   "I suppose there are many items of interest in the proceedings of the
   Genesee Conference, that we shall not receive unless you or some one
   shall give them to us. I did not get a copy of the charges against
   them, but I suppose they refer to the quarterly and camp meetings. But
   God still lives; salvation is free; and heaven is our home. The great
   reckoning day will set all things right.

   "May God still keep you.

   "J. W. AND MATTIE

   the writer was informed by a minister who was present, confessed that
   his course in the Genesee Conference difficulties was wrong.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 54

   Just before the time came to start for St. Louis, a few of Mr.
   Redfield's friends came together for a season of prayer. And those St.
   Charles pilgrims were mighty in prayer in those days. During this
   prayer meeting Mr. Redfield was greatly impressed with the saying of
   St. Paul, "I go bound in the Spirit . . . not knowing what may befall
   me, save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth, that in every city bonds and
   afflictions await me." He was afflicted to think he could not adopt the
   remainder of the passage, and say, "but none of these things move me."
   Referring to this experience he says, "If I had dared to turn back, I
   would have done so. I was confident that God had called me to St.
   Louis, but I knew no one there, and besides I had not money enough to
   run any hazard."

   They stopped at Princeton, in Bureau Co., Illinois, about one hundred
   miles on the way, to visit Rev. Charles French, with whom he had
   labored in St. Charles, the winter before. While here, a friend said to
   him, unasked, "I have some money for you," and handed him enough to
   take him to his destination and a little more. While waiting at
   Princeton, he penned another letter to Mrs. Kendall, of which the
   following is a copy:

   "Princeton, Bureau Co., Ill., Nov. 18, 1858.

   "My dear Sister Kendall: -- We received your letter dated the 11th
   instant, and with deep emotion, read the filling out of what was
   lacking in the reports we had received of the doings of the Genesee
   Conference. This gave us a clear view of the spirit as well as to
   doings of the Regency. [8] I confess that my anxieties for the future
   are most intense. I am continually asking myself, "Will the pilgrims
   hold on amid this furnace of affliction? or will they tire out from the
   discouragements of this evil time, and abandon the work God has given
   them to do?' You have nothing more to lose. You will never regain the
   forfeited favor of those deluded men if you forsake the work, and if
   you fail, who will dare to repeat the experiment? And yet your work
   must be done, if vital godliness is ever reinstated in the church.
   Remember the years of toil, and, apparently almost profitless, which it
   cost to lay the cornerstone of Christianity in Burma! Think of the many
   martyrs who fell before Africa received the gospel! And think of the
   self-sacrifice, toil, weeping, and groaning before God, amid slander
   and reproach, of a Luther and a Wesley! What if they had fainted? What
   would have become of the reformations which they led? Great moral
   reforms have always had their victims. Reformers must be content to let
   their reputations lie over, at least, for one generation.

   "But I'll stop this strain. I hardly know why I should be led out like
   this. But let me say, there are many hearts in these regions who pray
   for you, and who are with you heart and hand, and stand ready to enlist
   in any feasible project that bids fair to reestablish the primitive
   life, power, and simplicity of Methodism. And their number is
   increasing. I am glad the scribes, Pharisees, and Oddfellows were led
   to overt acts which have done more to open the eyes of the honest to
   see the necessity of some decisive plan of operations in returning to
   the "old paths."

   "You speak of severe mental conflicts, in which your reason seems to
   suffer. May I ask, is it like unto a bit of my own experience? While
   struggling to fulfill my obligations to God, enduring to my utmost
   power of endurance, groaning and weeping before God, my labors were
   questioned, my motives impugned, my character slandered, -- and that by
   a Methodist preacher, who all the time flattered me to my face. I cared
   not for myself, but when I found that the cause of Christ was suffering
   because of this, I was almost wild with grief, and was on the point of
   abandoning the field. Oh, what agony I experienced! The world never
   looked so desolate to me before. My bleeding heart would ask, why does
   the Lord suffer this? Why don't he remove the woe, and let me spend my
   days in quiet? I knew not what the Lord was doing with me. But I
   learned a lesson that I could have learned in no other way. I found two
   things in me that needed correction: One was, that I had taken more
   care upon me for God's cause than I could well endure, and had come to
   think that I was somewhat essential to its welfare. I forgot that God
   had to carry me and the cause also. The second thing was, that God held
   me responsible for fidelity, and not for success. How I then saw I was
   groaning over a few wrongs, while Jesus carried, endured, and wept over
   the wickedness and backslidings of the whole world. By this light I saw
   that God holds me responsible for duty, whether men hear or forbear. I
   now saw that my bewilderment arose from an attempt to settle these
   matters by my own reason. Then this simple track was presented to me:
   Look only to Jesus when he commands; stop when he bids you; do the
   exact right; leave no duty undone, and let God manage the results. This
   saves from all policy working even to outwit the devil. It saves from
   all planning, and all fear for results. It is resting wholly in Christ,
   and in the use of God's word and plan for the redemption of the world.

   "Down deep in my soul I feel God is with you and will lead you, if you
   give him a fair chance. You will be led to duties that will test your
   views of propriety. Our views of propriety are usually from our
   reasoning, which needs this discipline. This disturbance of our
   reasoning is due to the conflict between our sense of propriety and
   that unadorned simplicity which the Spirit of God would institute. Let
   God move you in harmony with his word and the history of the past, and
   all will be well.

   J. W. Redfield."

   The next day after receiving the money from his friend, they took the
   train for Burlington, Iowa, where they expected to take a steamer for
   St. Louis. Here they had to wait a week, as it was late in the season,
   and many of the boats had stopped running. Mr. Redfield's state of mind
   was anything but pleasant. It seemed to him that he was going to meet
   with trouble.

   On reaching St. Louis they put up at a hotel, at great expense. In a
   few days he began to look for cheaper quarters. For awhile matters
   looked as though they would have to leave the city, but at last he
   found a place where they could board at $12.50 per week, and this to be
   paid in advance. As soon as they could get settled he went in search of
   a Methodist church. There were plenty of southern Methodist churches,
   but he desired a northern church, as he did not feel free to become
   identified with a slaveholding people. It was difficult to find any who
   knew of such a church as he desired. He had letters of introduction to
   Rev. Dr. Williams, but no one seemed to know his residence. Sunday
   morning came, and he found the Ebenezer church and Dr. Williams its
   pastor. At the close of the morning sermon, he handed the pastor his
   letters of introduction, also their church letters. The 5th of
   December, he preached for the first time, at the invitation of the
   pastor. After this, in one of the official meetings a motion was made
   to invite him to assist the pastor in revival meetings. But the pastor
   refused to put the question, saying, "I propose to hold the reins of
   this pulpit in my own hands, and only invite to assist me whom I
   please. If you are dissatisfied with me, and desire this man, I can
   pack my carpetbag and leave." Mr. Redfield was not present, and knew
   nothing of the proposition to invite him until some time after.

   During this time he had been in search of a still cheaper boarding
   house, and finding one that was more reasonable, he was about to
   remove, when his landlady refused to let him take his trunks unless he
   would pay another week's board. He went to a bank to get a draft
   cashed, and found it imperfect, and that it must be sent back to
   northern Illinois to be corrected before he could draw the money on it.
   To get out of his difficulty he had to pawn his watch. Before the draft
   returned, a Jew, learning of the circumstances, unsolicited, went and
   redeemed his watch and returned it to him.

   But now the news came to him of what took place in the official board.
   He said nothing to any one but his wife, but he felt that jealousy was
   at the bottom of the trouble, and that he had better leave. But his
   wife said, "No. God has sent us here, and we must stay." They then
   concluded that if there was to be trouble in the church, their mission
   would be to the people in house to house visitation. They made some
   visits, and God began a glorious work, in which quite a number were
   blessedly saved. But this was called sowing dissension.

   About this time he was invited to preach in a colored people's church,
   and when he consented to do so, advised that the white people be not
   informed of it, lest they come to the meeting, and he be accused of
   drawing off the congregation from Ebenezer church. The first night God
   blessed the truth, and nearly every sinner in the house was at the
   altar for prayer. This could not be kept secret, and soon white people
   from Ebenezer church began to come. Occasionally he was allowed to
   preach in Ebenezer, and his congregations, when it was known
   beforehand, were large. The doctrine of holiness, as he presented it,
   attracted much attention, and the membership, not only of this church,
   but of other churches, became much interested in it; and a general
   revival was manifestly coming on.

   He says "I was in the company of the pastor one day, and was desirous
   of convincing him of my honesty and sincerity; and this especially as I
   had heard that he and other preachers had branded me as a fanatic, and
   an impostor, and that instead of being a Methodist, I was a
   Campbellite, etc. Without adverting to this, I said, "Doctor, I am so
   burdened for St. Louis, it seems as though I must see salvation come,
   or I cannot endure it."

   "Oh," said he, "I never allow myself to get such burdens. If they do
   come, I go to bed and sleep them of."

   "I saw I could awaken no chord of sympathy in him on that line, and I
   said:

   "I am a Methodist, and you, yourself, cannot find any thing in my
   preaching at variance with John Wesley."

   "But," said he, "there are many of us Methodist preachers who do not
   believe with John Wesley."

   "And so every effort to bring myself into communion with him failed.

   "Soon after this, the quarterly conference met, and a vote was taken on
   inviting me to hold meetings in the church, from one to three weeks;
   and only one man voted against it. When the pastor saw the unanimity of
   the vote, he remarked, "Well, give us a good collection next Sunday,
   and after next Tuesday he can preach."

   "I was not present, but this was reported to me by one who was. When
   the time came for me to begin, I felt a presentiment that I would meet
   with trouble of some kind, and so I went in good season. But when I
   arrived at the church, a presiding elder, who was known to be an
   opposer of the doctrine of holiness, was in the pulpit, and had
   commenced the service. After the singing and prayer, Doctor W_____ said
   to me, "Come forward and preach." I went into the pulpit and commenced.
   I had felt impressed to take a copy of the Discipline, and also a copy
   of Rev. Joseph Hartwell's tract, giving quotations from Wesley's views
   on sanctification, with me. In the midst of my discourse, I thought it
   best to say to the congregation that the official board had invited me
   to stay and preach from one to three weeks; but if I do, it is due to
   you to know what I am. I then said, "I am a Methodist," and drawing the
   Discipline from my pocket, I repeated the rules to which I had
   subscribed, and which I tried to live to. "You may want to know also
   what are my views on the doctrine of holiness"; and then drawing from
   my pocket the extracts from Wesley, I said, "Here are my views,
   straight out of Wesley's works." These I read, giving page and section.
   I then said, "If I stay, I must preach the same class of truths to
   which you have listened from me since I have been here. And I think it
   is due that I make this frank statement, that if I stay, I must so
   preach the whole law that I can meet it again. And I think it is due to
   me to know whether you want it, and will abide by it. So I will ask
   all, saints and sinners, to say, by vote, whether you--

   "I was going to say, will do so or not." But I was interrupted by Dr.
   W_____, ho caught me by the arm and said, "Stop, sir; I am responsible
   for this pulpit."

   "I felt perfectly calm, and turning to him, said, "Doctor, I was not
   going to transcend the proprieties of the pulpit, but"--

   "Stop, sir"; said he. "I am responsible for this pulpit."

   "I tried again and again to make an explanation, but he forbade it, and
   then commanded me to go on with my sermon.

   "Afterwards, this was reported to have been an effort on my part to
   take a vote of the congregation whether I or he should occupy the
   pulpit.

   "While this was taking place in the pulpit, my soul was talking with
   God. An unearthly power rested upon me. God seemed to be all around me.
   He seemed to say, "I want you to preach the straight truth for once;
   will you?'

   "My heart said, "I will."

   "But if you do, you may be stopped."

   "Well," said I, "I will go on till I am stopped."

   "You, probably, never will be permitted to preach again."

   "I will go the straight way for this once, if it is the end of my
   preaching."

   C. H. Underwood, at that time a business man in St. Louis, but who was
   afterward converted and became a minister of the gospel, once told the
   writer, that Mr. Redfield's sermon that night was awful, in its
   arraignment of the unsaved and particularly the unsaved of the church,
   before the bar of God.

   In the pulpit and around it, were seated, two presiding elders, one
   church editor, and several city pastors. While the sermon was in
   progress, these men seemed to listen in breathless amazement. Many were
   smitten by conviction that night, among whom was Mr. Underwood.

   The next night, as Mr. Redfield was walking down the aisle to the
   pulpit, Doctor Williams met him, and said:

   "I have received a strange letter from the official board. Let us go
   into the parsonage and read it."

   When Mr. Redfield opened it he found it to read as follows:

   "St. Louis, Jan. 20, 1859.

   "To Rev. Dr. Williams:

   "Dear Brother: -- The undersigned members of the official board of
   Ebenezer charge have witnessed with regret the unprecedented conduct of
   Dr. Redfield since the commencement of his labors, and more especially
   on last night. Shocked at his proceedings, and believing that his
   labors are calculated to do more harm than good, by creating schism and
   dissension in the church, and feeling an abiding interest in the
   welfare of the church, and prosperity of the cause, earnestly request
   that you quietly tell Dr. Redfield that he cannot occupy the pulpit any
   more.

   "Yours respectfully,

   "J. W. HEATH,

   "D. CAUGHLIN,

   "J. W. Hathaway,

   "Wm. Schureman:"

   Mr. Redfield was greatly shocked, to see that so few could reverse the
   action of the quarterly conference; that this could take place in so
   short a time; and that part of the complaints were of matters that
   occurred before the action of the quarterly conference that invited him
   to hold the meetings; and he said to Dr. Williams:

   "Can you tell me why there are so few names to this letter?"

   "This is from the board of trustees, and the trustees can control me
   and the pulpit.. I am sorry", said he, "but I cannot help it; you and I
   are good friends."

   "Well," said Mr. Redfield, "what shall I do? Should I go into the
   church tonight?"

   "I think," said he, "you had better not."

   Mr. Redfield sent some one in to call out his wife, and while waiting
   for her to come out, he was approached by one who said, "Is anything
   amiss?"

   "No," answered he, only the board of trustees have requested the doctor
   to shut me out of the pulpit."

   Another said, "That is one of Williams' tricks."

   "No," said Mr. Redfield, "that cannot be, for I read the letter and saw
   the names of those who signed it."

   It was soon whispered through the church, that Mr. Redfield was shut
   out of the pulpit, and a large proportion of the congregation arose and
   left the house.

CHAPTER 55

   The next morning Mr. Redfield called on Dr. William, and secured a copy
   of the letter from the official board, and asked for his own and his
   wife's church letters. Referring to this, he says:

   "I incidentally remarked that I should either go into a free state or
   join one of the other Northern Methodist churches in the city. And I
   took a copy of the letter from the trustees in order to refute the
   charge that Dr. Williams was its author. On my way home I met one who
   thus charged him, and I said, "Here is a copy of that letter, and it
   shows that you are mistaken." He read it, and then replied, "Only one
   of those men is a trustee; and now I know that Williams is at the
   bottom of this affair."

   "Here, then, were the names of four persons who attempted to rule the
   whole congregation, and one trustee to rule a whole quarterly
   conference.

   "From this brother I now learned that seventy-two members of the church
   had held a meeting the night before and sent the following declaration
   to the official board:

   "To the members of the Official Board of the Ebenezer charge of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church:

   "Brethren: -- Whereas, by the uncalled-for exercise of official power
   of a few individuals of Ebenezer charge in the city of St. Louis, which
   has lately taken place, whereby a large proportion of the members of
   said church have been deprived of their rights and privileges
   guaranteed to them, as we believe by the word of God, and the
   Discipline of the church; and, whereas we deem it our duty to state the
   causes which have induced us to separate ourselves from said church, as
   well as to assure our brethren from whom we have thus separated, that
   in so doing we have no other motive than the promotion of the cause of
   the Lord Jesus Christ, and the exercise of those privileges which we
   have lately been deprived of by the unlawful exercise of a power never
   intended to be invested in these four men holding official position in
   said church; and, whereas, we do not believe in the "one-man power,"
   nor the unlawful exercise of an authority of four men, never conferred
   upon them, and that for the accomplishment of an unholy purpose, such
   as has lately occurred, which we deem oppressive and unjust, before God
   and man; therefore,

   "Resolved, that we ask the privilege, as we claim the right, of
   adhering to, and continuing in, the Methodist Episcopal Church, both
   from principle, and from a firm belief in the doctrines of said church.

   "Resolved, 2. That we have the utmost confidence in the Christian
   character and the holiness of purpose of Rev. Dr. Redfield, a minister
   of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and that his close-pointed preaching
   of the gospel is in accordance with the usage of the primitive church
   in bringing sinners to a saving knowledge of the truth as it is in
   Jesus Christ.

   "Resolved, 3. That we hold the mandate issued by the four officials in
   Ebenezer charge, excluding Dr. Redfield from the pulpit, thereby
   denying him the privilege of preaching to a congregation assembled for
   that purpose, as unjustifiable, unauthorized by the Discipline, and
   ruinous to the church.

   "Resolved, 4. That this unjustifiable and high-handed breach of trust,
   by the said four officials, deprives us of the social and religious
   privileges we have heretofore enjoyed in said church; and being thus
   deprived by the arbitrary act of said officials from the privileges
   aforesaid, we feel we have no other alternative than to separate
   ourselves from said Ebenezer charge, which we have now done in the fear
   of God, who will judge our action in the great day of account.

   "Resolved, 5. That we do hereby solemnly protest in the name of the
   great I Am, against the course pursued by these officials in Ebenezer
   charge toward Rev. Dr. Redfield, and also against the known wishes of a
   large majority of the said church and congregation.

   "Resolved, 6. That a committee of three of our number be appointed to
   attend the next official meeting of Ebenezer charge, to lay before it
   this preamble and these resolutions, and ask that they be spread upon
   the records of the board."

   When this paper was presented there were attached to it the signatures
   of ninety members of the church.

   These members began now to call for their church letters. At first, Dr.
   Williams endeavored to dissuade them from their purpose, and after
   granting the request of twenty, he then refused to give any more. When
   at last he saw the blame thrown upon those four men, he acknowledged
   himself to be the author of that letter. Thus the whole thing proved to
   be a fraud perpetrated by himself.

   There is in this document, addressed to the official board, an evidence
   of haste. Probably a delay of a few days would have made a great
   difference in the character of that paper. But there was strife in the
   air that affected this movement, which was not clearly apprehended by
   some of the actors. The following letter to the Northern Independent,
   written about this time, will make this plain:

   "GREAT SECESSION IN ST. LOUIS.

   "Mr. Editor: -- I see from the Central Advocate, published in the city
   of St. Louis, that there has been a terrible thunderstorm, a great
   moral earthquake -- a large secession from one of the Methodist
   Episcopal churches in that city. But let it not be forgotten that this
   secession has taken place in slaveholding territory -- in one of the
   "border conferences." It has taken place, too, in a city where there
   are but two copies of the Northern Independent taken, and they are sent
   to editors in exchange. Yet, strange as it may appear, Brother Brooks
   charges that secession on the Northern Independent. What a powerful
   influence the Independent exerts! From the predictions of our church
   papers, I had supposed that secessions were to take place in Central
   New York. But lo and behold, it commences in "border territory."

   "From the braggadocio and insulting style of the editor, I should think
   him a relative of "Bully Brooks," of Washington notoriety. His
   editorial is unworthy of a Christian minister. But something must be
   done to put down Hosmer, Mattison, and company. Just hear him: "It is
   high time that decisive steps were taken for the protection of the
   church. We seriously question the temporizing policy which has been
   adopted by our eastern brethren."

   "Why, bless your dear soul, Brother Brooks, the power of episcopacy and
   of the conservative press, has been in full operation for the last two
   years to put down our beloved Independent and its friends, but without
   success. This "crushing out policy" don't and will not succeed.

   "But Mr. Brooks is frank enough to acknowledge that J. W. Redfield, an
   itinerant local preacher, has been the main instrument in bringing
   about the above-named secession. Now we desire to state distinctly for
   the benefit of Brother Brooks, that Mr. Redfield is in no wise
   connected with the Northern Independent, nor, so far as I know, in
   sympathy with it, for he does not take it. Moreover, Mr. Brooks must
   know that the Independent is not in sympathy with that peculiar
   doctrine advocated by Mr. Redfield. But the editor must have something
   to rant about. I hope, after this awful vomiting of bile, Brother
   Brooks will himself be greatly relieved. Missouri is said to be very
   bilious to old conservatives. If the editor would take a good use of
   common sense, he would be greatly relieved; otherwise, I fear his
   disease will prove fatal.

   "But after all the rant and cant about secession, Brother Brooks says:
   "We have not directed attention to this subject, because we have any
   apprehension that the Methodist Episcopal Church is in any danger."
   Good. You think just as many do in this region, Brother Brooks. No, my
   good brother, the Independent will not injure the church, so shed no
   more crocodile tears.

   "Allow me, Brother Hosmer, to thank Mr. Brooks for bringing the
   Independent to the notice of his readers in slave territory.

   "April 20, 1859.

   "The Spy."

   This letter indicates that an effort was made by Mr. Brooks, editor of
   the Central Christian Advocate, to connect the disturbance in Ebenezer
   church with the Independent. We have already noticed the origin and
   character of that paper. William Hosmer, its editor, was a strong
   believer in the doctrine of holiness, and much in sympathy with the
   pilgrims in Western New York, and the columns of his paper often rang
   with warnings to the officials of the church against the high-handed
   usurpations of power on the part of subordinates in the church, aimed
   at the crushing out of the holiness revival.

   For years a hot discussion had been going on in the church papers over
   the doctrine of holiness itself. Nathan Bangs, Jesse T. Peck, Joseph
   Hartwell, and others, had written in defense of it. They held to the
   doctrine as taught by the Wesleys. Hiram Mattison, C. P. Bragdon, and
   many others, had written against it. The writings of Mattison had
   slowly, but surely, poisoned the theology of many of the ministry, who
   stood ready, by one means and another, to hinder and crush out the
   teaching of Wesleyan views.

   The cringing attitude of the church on the slavery question bad
   developed a policy of administration, and even of preaching along the
   border of Mason and Dixon's line, that was destructive to independence
   of character except in opposition to every form of radicalism. This
   policy-spirit had undermined the spiritual life, and the conscience of
   the church, until such things as have been recorded in this chapter
   were possible with both the ministry and the laity.

   When men got their eyes open to the real character of this spirit, they
   were filled with horror and distrust of those who still were actuated
   by it. Mr. Redfield's preaching left no middle ground. He poured such
   floods of light upon the motives of men that they could but see
   themselves in their true character. Some repented, and, full of
   gratitude for being saved from such an abyss of moral corruption,
   perhaps unwisely, would speak in strong approval of the faithfulness of
   Mr. Redfield's labors. This roused the jealousy of time-serving
   ministers, and the hatred of men who would not walk in the light. His
   friends were of the most spiritual in the church, his enemies of the
   worldly. The friendship of his friends was strong as death, while the
   enmity of his enemies was bitter to the extreme. Thus the gulf of
   separation was deeper than the width of this church action would
   indicate. Spiritual men, on the ground, would be convinced of its
   impassableness, when those at a distance would see but little worthy of
   notice. Of the actors in this conflict we shall see more by-and-by.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 56

   A committee now waited on Mr. Redfield, and asked him to become the
   pastor of the new organization. But he answered, "I cannot do that
   unless you are regularly organized and recognized by the presiding
   elder."

   They went to see him, and he told them he was glad to know of their
   taking this course, and he would recognize them. They returned and drew
   up a formal petition to that effect, which was signed by the members
   interested, and then presented to the elder again. He now had changed
   his mind, and declined doing it.

   In the meantime, many of those who had withdrawn from Ebenezer were
   demanding an organization; and if that was not done, they declared
   their intention to join some other of the city churches; but were
   unanimous in a determination not to return to the Ebenezer church.

   Dr. Williams came to Mr. Redfield soon after, and commanded him to
   bring back the people he had taken away, or he would expel him, and
   then publish him to the world.

   Mr. Redfield replied, "I cannot do that. I never took them away, and I
   can never bring them back."

   "You have split my church all to pieces," said he.

   "You know better than that," was Mr. Redfield's reply.

   Soon after this, Mr. Redfield received the following letter:

   "ST. Louis, January 26, 1859.

   "To Rev. Dr. Redfield:

   "Dear Sir and Brother: -- We are pained with the disruption of our
   church which has occurred recently in this city. With the present light
   upon the subject, we are persuaded that the responsibility rests
   chiefly with you. That a more perfect understanding may be reached, and
   the schism, if possible, be healed, we respectfully ask an interview
   with you this afternoon at three o'clock, at the office of the Central
   Christian Advocate, 7 N. Fourth street.

   "We trust you may not fail to meet us.

   "Signed,

   "Thomas WILLIAMS,

   Pastor of the Ebenezer Church.

   "WINTER R. Davis",

   Pastor of Hedding Church.

   "JOSEPH BROOKS,

   Editor of the C. C. Advocate."

   In a note at the foot of this letter, the time was changed to 10 a.m.
   of the next day.

   Mr. Redfield says: "I did not feel willing to meet these men,
   especially Dr. Williams, who was capable of that fraudulent letter; and
   Mr. Brooks, whom I too well knew, from report and otherwise, and trust
   myself with them. So instead of going to meet them I thought it best to
   answer the call by the following letter:

   "ST. Louis, January 26, 1859. 11:30 p. m.

   "To Rev. Dr. Williams, Rev. J. Brooks, and Professor Davis:

   "Dear Brethren --Your note of today, received after church, greatly
   surprises and grieves me. I know Brother Brooks intimated to me last
   night that I was the principal cause of the disaffection complained of,
   but I could not make myself believe that the sober second thought,
   after a fair investigation, would at all warrant such a conclusion. I
   claim to be a North Methodist, and have tried to build up the cause of
   Wesleyan Methodism, and am confident that all my teachings in this city
   will bear a comparison in their orthodoxy with our standard authors. I
   have acted conscientiously and trust your charity will award to me an
   approval consistent with this statement. I cannot see that I am
   blameworthy if others show an attachment, as Methodists, for Methodist
   doctrines. It is thought I can heal, by correcting all the causes of
   the state of affairs complained of. I honestly believe I am not the
   cause, and I feel just as sure that I cannot heal what I have not
   wounded. I am willing to do, and will do, anything consistent with
   right, which you may prescribe, to reach such an end. When I took my
   letter I did design, quietly, to change my relation, either to another
   Northern Methodist church, or to go to a free state, hoping to get away
   from so troublesome a state of things. I knew not that another person
   besides myself and wife had any design to take letters; neither did I
   state to any one that I had done so, till I learned that others had
   done the same, fearing that it would be construed into hostility to
   Ebenezer church. I designedly refrained from expressing opinions, and
   likewise from attending preliminary meetings, having in view steps of
   separation. But when it was announced that a new organization was a
   fact, and the papers were duly made out to petition the elder to
   perfect the organization, and there was a unanimous desire that I
   should preach for them until the proper officers should make provisions
   to supply them, I accepted their invitation, believing I was violating
   no obligations in so doing, as a loyal member of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church. If others think I have, and will convince me of the
   same, I will correct my mistake if it is in my power to do so.

   "Now if you can find one person who has taken a letter, and who will
   state that I, by word or act, directly or indirectly, have incited them
   to do so, I will quietly retire out of your midst, into a free state.
   Or if you can find a majority of two-thirds, or one-quarter, even, who
   will state that if I were gone out of the city they would go back and
   return their letters to Ebenezer, I will then leave.

   "But will you permit me to ask you, brethren, if your united wisdom
   cannot devise some plan by which the cause of Methodism may be so
   extended that we all can work without this, to me, very unpleasant
   state of things? I am ready to serve the church free of charge, and I
   ask, will you not try some plan to meet the increasing demands of this
   great city? Will you not try in your wisdom to husband the present tide
   of religious influence? Are we not brethren? and shall we not harmonize
   in the great battle for the right? I will do anything that is right at
   your suggestion to reach so happy an end. God knows I desire to see St.
   Louis saved, and a fair proportion of the people gathered into our
   beloved North church. I trust you will weigh my motives in an even
   balance, when I state to you that I have no personal interest to serve
   in the part I act in trying to promote this end.

   "I have chosen to write what I have to say to you, that I might say it
   more deliberately, and that you might review at any time what I have
   said, in making up your minds.

   "Yours, most respectfully,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   The next day he received the following reply:

   "ST. Louis, January 27, 1859.

   "To Dr. Redfield:

   "Dear Brother: -- As you have declined to meet with the pastors of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church of this city, this morning, according to our
   request, to endeavor to heal the unfortunate disruption that has taken
   place since you came to this city, we feel compelled by a stern sense
   of duty, in the fear of God, as pastors of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church, to seek an adjustment of this painful affair in another form,
   so far as your responsibilities are involved in the matter. Therefore,
   at the request of these pastors, it becomes my painful duty to request,
   in accordance with the Discipline of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   that you deposit your letter without delay in one of the charges of
   this city, and have your name enrolled in a class-book.

   "Yours respectfully,

   "THOMAS WILLIAMS."

   Mr. Redfield says:

   "I had a warning not three hours before, and I believe from the Spirit
   of God, that trouble was ahead, and said to my wife, "Something is
   coming, and I feel impressed to send our church letters away at once."
   So I had a letter written, and our church letters inclosed in it, and
   sent to the post office, and then went to church. At the close of the
   service I received Dr. Williams' reply. He came to me soon after, and
   said, he should now go war to the knife.' [9] Others said, a plan was
   being laid to compel me to leave the city; and that a course was to be
   pursued that would shut me out from all Methodist churches of the land.
   Another friend came to me with the word that he had reason to believe
   that the preachers would raise a mob against me, by the cry that I was
   an Abolitionist. Then Dr. Williams came to me one Saturday, and said,
   "If you will go to our church once tomorrow, I will let you off"; and I
   promised him I would. When my friends found this out, they stoutly
   resisted it, as they felt sure there was a plot of some kind in it. But
   I thought I would risk it and keep my word; but I was taken suddenly
   sick, and was unable to get out for three weeks. I suffered much from
   fear and grief. Every noise at night seemed to me like the noise of a
   mob, and I expected to see the windows burst in at any moment. I was
   grieved to think that ministers in my beloved church would resort to
   such means to accomplish wicked ends. I became so sick that I despaired
   of life, and said to my wife, "You'll have to leave my bones in St.
   Louis." At the end of this time I was taken to the church one Sunday
   morning, in a close carriage, and as I entered, the singers sang, as a
   voluntary,


   "Jesus look with pitying eye,

   Saviour help me or I die."

   Oh, how I felt the meaning of every word! On attempting to read a hymn,
   I found that my eyesight had failed, and from that time I had to wear
   glasses.

   "I was soon able to resume the charge of the society, and we thought it
   best that we should form ourselves into a Methodist church on the
   Congregational plan, but adding a rule against slavery. In the meantime
   I thought best to prepare to let the annual conference adjust our
   difficulties. Some said there was no use, but I thought there was. But
   sure enough, when the time came, the conference refused to look into
   the matter. At last we settled down to look after our work. New
   appointments sprang up, and calls began to come for me to labor.
   Visitors came from Richmond, Virginia, New Orleans, Natchez, Baltimore,
   Chicago, and other places; who had heard so much about us. They came to
   see for themselves, and said, "This is what we need at our place." So
   the good work went on."

   The conflict continued to rage hotly in St. Louis for considerable
   time, as the sequel shows. During this time Mr. Redfield wrote the
   following letters, which are of interest by way of throwing light upon
   the character of events then occurring, and also by way of revealing
   the true character of the man himself:

   "ST. Louis, Mo., Dec. 25, 1858.

   "My dear Sister Kendall -- We received a letter from Brother Hicks last
   evening, from which we learned the results of the Laymen's Convention
   at Albion, but not all the particulars.

   "We are now settled for the present in this wicked city, and are trying
   to clear away the rubbish so as to get down to the foundation rock. The
   novelty of the doctrine of holiness, and the measures we use, as well
   as the little power sometimes manifested, is startling to them here.
   One man lost his strength night before last, and fell hack on the
   floor. Some say such a thing never took place in Ebenezer church
   before. Some few profess to have received the blessing of perfect love,
   but the stamp does not come quite up to my wishes. Most of the people
   seem sincere, but timid and halting. Among the reclaimed backsliders is
   the son of Father Wait, of Albion. He has been backslidden for fifteen
   years. He is one of the city justices, has a great deal of energy, and
   uses it among his associates, lawyers and others, and deals as plainly
   with the church as Brother Purdy used to, is just about as impulsive,
   and feels he has a duty to do, and I am of the same impression. We have
   a few here who know what salvation is, and they stand up in defense of
   the definite work. How it will finally turn I cannot say, but hope and
   pray that before the fight comes on, which surely will come, that God
   may have one victory which will establish a gospel standard.

   "Our church is quite central, but small and old, while the South church
   has its full supply of large commanding churches, proud, fashionable,
   and world-loving. They frown upon the North church, call us intruders,
   and set us down with Negroes (bless the Lord!). But the strong gospel
   doctrines are taking hold of the honest-hearted sinners, and I hope
   they will have one chance to show what they can do.

   "I can see that Brother Kendall's triumphant translation has done for
   the pilgrims what nothing else could have done. That solemn vow of the
   preachers over his coffin has told upon that little band, and nerved
   them to acts which are felt for God. He died well. The pilgrims saw the
   divine approval of his course. Those who waited to see how he would
   fare have been thrown upon their own resources. The gospel did not
   succeed so well until after our Lord ascension.

   I am strongly impressed that God designs in this movement, to fit the
   pilgrim preachers for their work. How could they better learn to guard
   the entrance to the Christian ministry than by their sufferings from
   bad men in the ranks?

   The experience they are obtaining will help them, when the time comes,
   to frame a discipline that will put the devil to many years of hard
   toil to get it tangled up again. I am sure the movement must end in
   division and a new church at last; and yet I hope they will hold on
   until pushed from the last plank.

   "Firm in the Lord and in the power of his might,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   "ST. Louis, Mo., Jan. 13, 1859.

   "Dear Brother and Sister Foot: -- We have long contemplated writing to
   you, but the great number of our correspondents, and the fact that we
   had written to some in St. Charles, has caused this delay. We greatly
   desire to hear from you, and are particularly desirous to know how
   matters have turned in that region.

   "We have reason to believe God sent us to this city. The contest is
   very severe. Presiding elders and other preachers, who have advised the
   members to conform to the world, are greatly stirred. But God is
   raising up witnesses to testify to the fullness of salvation. Members
   of other churches are taking a bold stand for the truth. Some have
   expressed a great interest in the doctrine of holiness. One
   Congregationalist has experienced it, and now blazes with the fullness.
   A goodly number of Methodists now rejoice in a complete salvation. But
   the jeweled saints fight with a zeal worthy of a better cause.

   "Some ask me to go into other churches and preach this blessed fullness
   there. Some ask me to set up a new church, and many outsiders and
   Presbyterians and Congregationalists are ready to sustain it.

   "The powers of our church permitted me to preach a few times, and as
   the people received it the slaying power came, and then they stopped
   me. They tried to get along alone a few nights, but they could not make
   it move; and then they called for me again, and again the work moved
   with power. Then there was shouting, and that was stopped, and I was
   stopped again. Again they tried to make the work go their way, but it
   would not move. I am now holding off, and shall continue to do so until
   they pledge themselves that Bible religion shall be sustained. The
   outside pressure upon them, to have me preach, is getting very strong,
   and the contest waxes hotter and hotter. I am calmly waiting, standing
   still to see the salvation of God.

   "You would not wonder at this, if you could see the jewels, flummeries,
   feathers, and the whole wardrobe of perdition, passing on the backs of
   Methodists, like loaded camels. And further to hear some backsliders
   confess their wrong, and then declare that preachers had told them to
   "Dress up; put on all you can get on; and shine in the world." And
   further, that they need not attend class, etc. You cannot wonder that
   such kind of stuff and Bible religion will strike fire when they come
   together. How matters will turn I don't know. One thing I do know. God
   helping me I will stand for truth or die trying. I know you pray for
   us. I do not ask you to pray that we may be released from the burden,
   the labor or the reproach, but that our faith and fidelity fail not.

   "Yours affectionately,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   "ST. Louis, Jan. 30, 1859.

   "Dear Brother and Sister Foot: -- Your letter was duly received. Glad
   we were, indeed, to hear from you. Yet we are sorry that salvation
   cannot have a fair chance in St. Charles, to save and bless the people
   with a full salvation.

   "We are now convinced that God sent us to St. Louis. But such a battle
   we never had before. Our pastor blew up the official board for
   introducing a resolution to invite me to conduct the meetings. I was
   called upon, however, to preach, and the Bible salvation took most
   wonderfully. The people came out in great numbers, and then the
   preacher stopped me. The people urged, and now and then he would permit
   me to preach, and when the house would fill up he would stop me again.
   The church murmured, and he threatened to leave. On the 20th, I went
   into the church to preach, when he took me into the parsonage, and
   showed me a letter from the official board forbidding me to preach
   again. The people found it out, and seventy-two members demanded their
   letters. I asked how it happened that the leaders' names were not on
   the letters; and he said it came from the trustees. Then it came out
   that only one of the four names was that of a trustee. When the people
   repudiated the dictatorship of the four men, the preacher owned up that
   he was the author of the letter. The people then formed a new church at
   once, with the promise of 150 members. The preacher lays the separation
   to me, and has demanded my letter, and threatens to expel me, and cut
   off all that left. He has got the presiding elder, the editor, and all
   the conference preachers on his side against us, but the outsiders, and
   the members of other churches, sympathized with us, and opened a fine
   church for our use. This made our enemies more angry than before. God
   came in power, and sinners have been saved. The people and the Lord
   seemed to leave them, and then they threatened us with war to the
   knife. It so happened that I expressed no opinion about dividing, nor
   counseled it directly or indirectly, but I have to bear the blame. Our
   friends have drawn up a writing, stating positively that I did nothing
   in any way to promote the separation, which they have all signed. This
   has been published. Then came a charge that I split the St. Charles'
   church; but a man from there happened along here, who gave the facts,
   and that story was spoiled.

   I am waiting now to have the organization perfected, when I expect
   again to enter the field. We need your prayers, that God may defend the
   cause of righteousness. Holiness is our theme. God comes in power.
   Mattie says, such a class meeting as she attended today she never
   attended before. There were ten seekers of religion.

   "Many honest-hearted sinners desire that we build a new church of our
   own, and are ready to help.

   "Yours in love,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   In a letter to Mrs. Kendall dated February 17, after recounting the
   history of the work in St. Louis down to that date, almost exactly as
   in the foregoing letter, he says:

   "Now the question comes up: Where shall we attach ourselves? We have
   offered ourselves to the Methodist Episcopal Church, and they spurn us.
   We cannot go to the Methodist Church South on account of slavery. We
   are Methodists, and cannot be anything else. I said to them, "Perhaps
   the pilgrims of Western New York will receive you, and look after you."

   "So they have organized congregationally until they can open up
   negotiations with the East. We have written to Brother Roberts to come
   on and take charge. There are a number of other places where matters
   are somewhat as they are here.

   "I must go up to Quincy, Illinois, next week, if it is at all possible,
   to hold another meeting this season. That is about 130 miles north, on
   the river.

   "The opposition have sent for Bishop Janes to come and help them out of
   their difficulty. He is expected today. But it is too late. The new
   church voted night before last, to make no further attempt at
   reconciliation.

   "I have for years seen that we must come to this; but never once
   supposed that it would be done in my day. But we are forced into it.

   "I think I never suffered more in so short a time in my life, than
   while I have been here. The trouble laid me up, sick-a-bed for a
   fortnight, but I dared not run. It cheers my heart to think that the
   pilgrims are praying for me.

   "Yours,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   On March 2, 1859, he wrote again to Brother and Sister Foot of St.
   Charles, Illinois, as follows:

   "My dear Brother and Sister Foot: -- Your welcome and cheering letter
   of February 27, was received last night. I answer thus early, and your
   questions in particular, that you may be able to form a just opinion of
   all matters pertaining to the division here.

   "The Ebenezer charge, when the division of the church on the question
   of slavery occurred, eleven years ago, had more members and better
   prospects than at the time of our arrival here last fall. At the last
   conference there were reported 140 members. Those who have left to form
   the new church are all the spiritual members of the flock, with a few
   exceptions. Over one hundred of them left. Seven of them are local
   preachers. There are a few spiritual ones left, but their hearts are
   with us. Before deciding to form a new church, several joined the South
   church, and a large portion of the remainder were determined to go to
   some other church if we did not organize. To save them to the church
   North, it was necessary to form a new society. Just at the time when we
   were discussing the question, Where can we hold meetings? and a
   committee was seeking a place, a gentleman, the owner of a large
   church, offered it to us on such terms that we accepted it. It is in
   the heart of the city, large and commodious. It was formerly occupied
   by the Baptists, but about this time the society broke up.

   "If the new society was to dissolve today, it is not likely that ten of
   the members would return to the Ebenezer church. They have organized
   under a congregational form of government, and will wait until
   conference to see what is best to be done. If at conference they cannot
   get a pledge to be supplied with Methodist preachers, at least
   religiously inclined, they will then unite with the pilgrims of Western
   New York. The pilgrims here have not as much of the laboring power as
   they need, but they are seeking it. And yet they are comparatively free
   to what they were before they left. There, if any got to shouting or
   exhorting, the preacher would stop them, and in private call them
   "grannies."

   "Already we have a large, growing Sunday School, and are looking for
   one or two more places in which to hold meetings, with the hope of
   establishing new societies.

   "The people say we must not leave St. Louis, but I see they are leaning
   upon us. I dare not tell them, but I always feel like running away when
   I see symptoms of that nature. The most of those left in the old
   church, you may set down as like Brothers_____, _____, and Sister
   _____, except the few I spoke of, who, like Nicodemus, are disciples,
   but secretly for fear of the Jews. The piety, the talent, and the
   working force, are in the new organization.

   "God is with us, and the number is daily increasing. Our church on
   Sundays is crowded to its utmost capacity, and many are obliged to go
   away for lack of accommodations.

   "Dr. Williams and the few who stand by him, have been trying every
   possible way to upset and destroy us, but so far have signally failed.
   They sent for Bishop Janes, but since he has gone, they have lowered
   the tone of their opposition and their threatenings have ceased. It is
   surmised that the bishop has advised this.

   "Wife and I expect to go to Quincy for a short time. The people here
   say we must return, and stay; but I very much need rest, and I feel I
   must have it. I would gladly go to St. Charles and spend a short time.

   "Our fight here has been the most severe I have ever known. I don't
   wonder that Satan contends sharply to hold his own in this Vanity Fair.
   Theaters, masquerade halls, rum holes, with Sabbath breaking, abound.
   The churches have so far kept in the good graces of his Satanic
   Majesty, that but little damage has been done to his kingdom since the
   city has had a being. Somebody has got to get a broken back for
   disturbing this state of things, and it may as well be I as anybody.
   The thing must be done, or St. Louis is lost. I have suffered so much
   that it seems as though I could never go into another such conflict. It
   laid me on my back for two weeks. I am hardly able to do anything of
   moment now. Yet God keeps my head above water, and the people are very
   kind and sympathizing. My whole heart goes out in prayer that God may
   remember them, for they have not been ashamed of my chain. I tell you
   this strong salvation makes strong friends and hot enemies.

   "I don't feel equal in giving you advice in relation to your meetings.
   Yet I must say, dear sister, I cannot see how you can be true to God
   and truth, without throwing your whole weight into the scale of right.
   Will not some of the Marys, "last at the cross, and earliest at the
   grave," stand in the way and lift up the voice like a trumpet? God's
   cause must not go down! But who will hazard all, and die a moral martyr
   for Christ?

   "The Lord bless you all.

   "J. W. Redfield."

   Mr. Redfield, during the time of these troubles and afterward, passed
   through severe mental conflicts in regard to the course he had taken.
   His naturally sensitive and shrinking nature drew back from everything
   like severity and cruelty. Anything like mental or physical pain in
   others would cause him the most intense anguish. The accidental injury
   of a bird, or beast, or even a fly, would cause him to weep. Such a
   nature felt intensely all the attacks made upon his character, the
   questioning of his motives, the withdrawal of friendship, and the open
   hostility of his enemies. Naturally he was a coward; religiously, the
   bravest and most faithful of men. In the pulpit or in the social
   circle, when he felt he stood forth in the name of Jehovah, his hearers
   would be impressed with his bravery and fidelity; but when merely
   himself, they would think him a marvel of human weakness. He relates
   this incident in his experience at the time of the troubles in St.
   Louis.

   "I was now beset by enemies who tried to annoy me in every possible
   way; and I felt heartbroken to think that after being so pressed in
   spirit and crowded by the Lord to go this thorough way, I must meet
   with such opposition from ministers of the gospel. It seemed more than
   I could endure. And I could but examine my whole course and motives,
   and then ask the Lord, "If I am right, why are these things permitted?"
   I was talking like this to Sister M_____, one day, when she related to
   me the following:

   "When we moved here from Cincinnati three years ago, I told my husband
   I could not join the Southern church for I was an Abolitionist. I went
   to the Ebenezer church, but it was so dead that I could not think of
   joining that. I saw so little of spiritual life in the city, that it
   seemed as though I could not stay here. So I went to the Lord about it
   in prayer, and he told me to hold on, and he would send a man to preach
   the true gospel. About the time you came, I began to feel that the man
   had come, but I had heard nothing about you. I said to my husband one
   Sunday morning, "I must go to Ebenezer church, for I feel the man has
   come the Lord promised me he would send." But he said, "Your health is
   so poor, it will not do for you to go; and your doctor will be
   displeased." But I felt I must go, though the church was two miles away
   from us. I finally persuaded husband to go along, and when we entered
   the door and saw you in the pulpit, I said, "That is the man the Lord
   promised me." The Lord had let me see you, and I knew you."

   "This was of great encouragement to me, and allayed all toy fears for
   the time being."

   church where Mr. R_____ was then laboring.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 57

   Information now came to Mr. Redfield that Mr. Roberts, who had been
   expelled from the Genesee Conference, was laboring under the auspices
   of a Laymen's Convention held in Albion, N. Y., during the first part
   of the winter. This convention after remonstrating against the course
   of the conference, in expelling Mr. Roberts and Mr. McCreery, passed a
   resolution, asking Mr. Roberts to go through the country and discuss
   the action of the conference, guaranteeing him his support while so
   engaged. When Mr. Roberts was called in, and the resolution read to
   him, he declined the request, but offered to spend his time for a year
   in evangelistic work if they desired it. The resolution was then
   reconsidered and changed to harmonize with that proposition. Mr.
   Roberts and Mr. McCreery had appealed to the General Conference which
   would be held in May, 1860, and both had united with the church again,
   on probation, according to Discipline. They did this that they might
   legally labor in spreading the gospel, while their appeals were
   pending. As Mr. Roberts' relation to the Methodist Episcopal Church, at
   this time was similar to that of their own, the new Society in St.
   Louis now sent for him to come and take Mr. Redfield's place for a
   season. This would leave Mr. Redfield free to go to Quincy, Illinois,
   where a field had awaited him for some time.

   Mr. Roberts went, helped to perfect the organization, and to make a
   rule against slavery that could not be evaded. One of the members,
   Joseph Wickersham, who for conscience' sake, when seeking perfect love,
   a few years before, had set at liberty $30,000 worth of slaves, was one
   of the most eager for such a rule. Thus on slave territory, these men
   and women who had gone into this new society, dared squarely to meet
   the question of slavery, when the Methodist Episcopal Church, as a
   body, through its conferences, annual and general, were cringing and
   dodging in regard to it. This circumstance shows that the difficulty
   was not with the laity, but with the ministry; and that all their pleas
   of toleration for slavery were baseless. Many of these persons were
   practical business men, and who knew the power of prejudice, and social
   ostracism, yet fearlessly they adopted this rule on slavery in a
   slaveholding city. Their action shows a conscientious boldness that
   will honor their names in time and in eternity.

   The Laymen's Convention under whose auspices Mr. Roberts was now
   laboring, had passed a resolution, based upon Dr. Abel Stevens'
   declaration of the reserved power of the laity to correct the
   mal-administration of the ministry, viz.: the right to withhold
   supplies. This resolution read as follows:

   "Resolved, That we will not aid in the support of any member of the
   Genesee Conference who assisted, either by his vote, or his influence,
   in the expulsion of Brothers Roberts and McCreery from the conference
   and the church, until they are reinstated to their former position; and
   that we do recommend all those who believe that these brethren have
   been unjustly expelled from the conference and the church, to take the
   same course."

   The resolution to employ Mr. Roberts and Mr. McCreery reads:

   "Resolved, That we recommend Rev. B. T. Roberts and Rev. J. McCreery to
   travel at large, and to labor, as opportunity presents, for the
   promoting of the work of God and the salvation of souls."

   The salary of each was fixed, and a committee of fifteen was appointed
   to collect the same.

   The policy was soon adopted by their enemies, of reading out of the
   church as withdrawn, all who acted upon these resolutions. In some
   places the numbers so cut off were so large that temporary
   organizations had to be effected to provide places of worship and to
   appoint officers to take the oversight of the work. This made work for
   the two men, and Mr. Roberts' visit to St. Louis was for the same
   object.

   The convention had also adopted the following resolution, that
   expressed its attitude toward the church:

   "Resolved, That the farcical cry of disunion and secession is the
   artful production of designing men to frighten the feeble and timid
   into their plans of operation and proscription. We wish it distinctly
   understood that we have not, and never had, the slightest intention of
   leaving the church of our choice, and that we heartily approve of the
   course of Brothers Roberts and McCreery in rejoining the church at
   their first opportunity; and we hope that the oppressive and
   unMethodistic administration indicated in the pastoral address (adopted
   by the Genesee Conference) as the current policy of the majority of the
   conference, will not drive any of our brethren from the church.
   Methodists have a better right in the Methodist Episcopal Church than
   anybody else, and by God's grace, in it we intend to remain."

   Mr. Redfield says of the state of affairs at this time in St. Louis:
   "We now expected our conference to set our matters right, and then to
   take us into conference; but if that failed, we had one hope left, and
   that was that the General Conference, to sit in about one year, would
   begin a system of correction which would eventually reach us. If that
   failed, we would be compelled to set up permanently for ourselves."

   This expresses the state of things in February, 1859. But little did
   these laymen or ministers know what awaited them in the future. There
   was a deceptive quiet, politically throughout the nation, that proved
   to be the precursor of a terrible storm of civil war. The slumbering
   feelings that found expression in that war, awed, and almost
   frightened, men from their steadfastness for the truth. Men, otherwise
   staunch and firm, proved unfaithful and untrue.

   The society in St. Louis soon felt it necessary for the protection of
   Mr. Redfield to publish the following resolutions, which were adopted,
   and ordered to be published without his knowledge:

   "Resolved, 1. That we deem it due to our worthy brother, Rev. Dr.
   Redfield, to state that amid all the difficulties, as well as the
   causes, which have resulted in the division of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church, at Ebenezer, in this city, he has stood aloof, neither advising
   nor counseling us as to what course to pursue in relation to said
   division; but like a man of God, full of love for the salvation of
   souls and the prosperity of our common Zion, he wept over the apparent
   calamities brought upon us by the unwise conduct of those assuming to
   have authority over us.

   "Resolved, 2. That as our brother is about to leave us, we commend him
   to all the churches in our beloved land, and pray that the great Head
   of the church may shield and protect him and his devoted wife, from the
   persecutions of their enemies, as well as the slanders the ungodly may
   send after them.

   "Resolved, 3. That the Central Christian, the Northwestern, and the
   Western Advocates, and the Christian Advocate and Journal, and those
   journals favorable to the cause of religion, be requested to publish
   these resolutions.

   "St. Louis, February 28, 1859."

   These resolutions were signed by ninety-four members of the society,
   and taken to the Central Christian Advocate for publication. But the
   editor, Rev. Joseph Brooks, said, "Don't ask us to publish that, but
   drop all matters, and be still, and we will be still. You publish
   nothing, and we will publish nothing."

   Dr. Williams came to Mr. Redfield, and asked him to use his influence
   to prevent the publication of it, and promised that they would publish
   nothing. Mr. Redfield promised to do so, but in a few days the
   following was published in the Central Christian Advocate:

   "Special Request

   "Early in the past winter, a Mr. J. W. Redfield, a local preacher,
   claiming to be directly from Northern Illinois or Michigan, and more
   remotely from New York or New England, came to this city. Being
   properly endorsed by the authority of the church, he was invited to aid
   in a series of religious services in Ebenezer church. During the time,
   he succeeded (as I am informed) in sowing dissensions among the
   members, and at length publicly proposed to take a vote of the
   congregation, as to whether he should occupy the pulpit. He was kindly
   invited to desist from further occupancy of the pulpit. This he did;
   and under a promise of uniting with one of the other city charges, or
   of going to Illinois, he asked and obtained from the pastor of Ebenezer
   a certificate of his membership and official standing, giving
   assurance, at the same time, that he would in no case have anything to
   do with separate services. In forty-eight hours, I am informed, he was
   publicly preaching to a company of the members of Ebenezer church, whom
   he had headed and led off, organizing and establishing separate
   services in another place, while the protracted services were still in
   progress in Ebenezer church.

   "Three several times has he been officially required to deposit his
   certificate in some one of the city charges, that he might be held to
   answer grave charges which are pending against him (and are now in my
   possession), involving his ecclesiastical and Christian character. He
   has constantly refused to comply with this requisition, treating the
   demand with contempt. Various statements have been made by himself and
   friends as to where he has deposited his certificate of membership. At
   one time it is said to have been sent to Illinois; at another to be
   deposited with some church of another denomination. Thus the case
   stands.

   "With many years experience in the church, I have never before known a
   case involving so much evasion, unmitigated duplicity, and contempt of
   the authority, order, and Discipline of the church.

   "This note is to request that any minister or member of the M. E.
   Church having knowledge of where he holds his membership, and is
   ecclesiastically amenable, will give me information at once.

   "SAMUEL HUFFMAN, P. E.,

   "St. Louis District, Missouri Conference."

   This was copied in many, if not in all, the church papers. And, strange
   to say, the minister who had given the church letter which Mr. Redfield
   presented, and which was publicly read in the Ebenezer church, knew of
   this published request, and yet never came to his relief with a
   statement of the facts.

   A few days after the publication of that paper, a committee appointed
   by the new church prepared a reply and took it to the Central Advocate,
   but the editor refused to publish it. It was then taken to the St.
   Louis Christian Advocate, the organ of the Methodist Episcopal Church
   South, where it was published in the following form:

   "OUR NORTHERN BRETHREN.

   "For several weeks past, as we have been informed, our Northern
   brethren in this city have not been in the most pleasant state of
   feeling among themselves. Some difficulty occurred in the Ebenezer
   church -- their principal church in the city -- which soon resulted in
   the withdrawal, in form or in fact, of one-half, or more than one-half,
   of the entire membership. These 'seceders' (we use that word in no
   offensive sense) organized themselves elsewhere, and have kept up
   separate services, which are reported to have been interesting and
   profitable; but the gap between them and the old church' (Ebenezer)
   seems, from what we hear, to be constantly widening. Below, we give
   place to a communication and explanations, which communication was
   intended for another paper, but not allowed a place in its columns. We
   publish it at the earnest solicitation of several persons who are
   personally friendly to us, and subscribers to our paper, although they
   never have belonged to the Southern church, and perhaps never will. It
   seems but just that they should have some medium through which to reply
   to what they consider unfair and unjust accusations.

   "It is not our purpose to meddle with their difficulties, and all we
   now state is upon information received from others. We have not from
   the first been any nearer the seat of war' than our own legitimate
   business has called us, but, if reports may be relied on, some strange
   things have occurred among them. -- ED. Advocate.

   "Editor St. Louis C. Advocate:

   "Dear Sir -The following was sent to the editor of the Central
   Advocate, with a request that it should be inserted, as a simple act of
   justice to Dr. Redfield, whom we believe to be an injured man. For
   reasons of his own, the editor of the Central refused to give it a
   place in his columns. We have, therefore, respectfully to ask that you
   will do us the favor to give it a place in your paper, as, at present,
   we have no other available means of reaching that portion of the public
   whom we most desire should see this, our honest statement of facts.

   "The paper was signed by five of those whose names are now appended, as
   a committee appointed for that purpose. When the editor of the Central
   refused to insert it, it was then reported back to the church by whom
   the committee had been appointed, and the following resolution was
   adopted unanimously:

   "Resolved, That as the following has been rejected by the Central
   Advocate, it be forwarded to the editor of the St. Louis Christian
   Advocate, with a request that it be published in that paper, and that
   it, also, be signed by those holding official position in Ebenezer
   church, when the separation took place.

   "For the Central Christian Advocate. "
   [Special Request].

   "Mr. Editor: -- An article bearing the above title, signed Samuel
   Huffman, P. E., published in your issue of the 16th, contains so many
   false statements of an injurious character, that we beg permission to
   correct the most important.

   "Mr. Huffman charges the Rev. J. W. Redfield with being unwilling, when
   he came to this city, to tell definitely where he was from, "claiming,"
   he says, "to be directly from Northern Illinois, or Michigan."

   "The tendency of this is, to excite suspicion that there must be
   something wrong about him, or he would be able and willing to state
   "whence he came."

   "This charge is utterly false. Dr. Redfield brought official letters
   from the church, which were read publicly in Ebenezer church, stating
   that he was "directly" from Elgin, Illinois.

   "Mr. Huffman next charges, on "information," Dr. Redfield, with 'sowing
   dissensions among the members' of Ebenezer church. That Dr. Redfield
   preached the gospel with great plainness and power, we readily admit;
   and many "came out from the world" and gave themselves anew to Christ.
   But for other influences than those excited by Dr. Redfield, we believe
   no "dissensions" among the members would have taken place.

   "Mr. Huffman charges Dr. Redfield with "publicly proposing to take a
   vote of the congregation, as to whether he should occupy the pulpit."
   Dr. Redfield never proposed any such thing. He had been invited by
   official members, the pastor concurring, to occupy the pulpit, and hold
   a series of meetings for three weeks. During the first sermon he
   preached after this invitation was given, Dr. Redfield proposed to take
   an expression of the congregation, as to whether they would like to
   have this searching class of truth presented. The pastor interrupted,
   and the next night forbade him the further occupancy of the pulpit.

   "Again, Mr. Huffman charges him with obtaining, under false pretenses,
   from the pastor of Ebenezer "a certificate of his membership and
   official standing."

   "We should like to know what right any "pastor' has to exact a promise
   before he will give a certificate of membership?

   "The certificate relates to present standing, and not to future
   conduct. But, as we understand it, the doctor made no "promise." He did
   not buy a "certificate." He simply expressed his intention. That
   intention, expressed honestly at the time, he had a perfect right to
   change.

   "Mr. Huffman charges Dr. Redfield with "heading and leading off a
   company of the members of Ebenezer church." This, also, is utterly
   untrue. Dr. Redfield never encouraged or advised, so far as we could
   learn, any one to leave Ebenezer church.

   "Those who left, did so of their own accord, and, as they believe, for
   sufficient reasons.

   "With organizing and establishing separate services," he had nothing to
   do. He even refused to attend their first meetings.

   "At the request of those who organized themselves into a separate
   society, he has preached for them, and, we trust, will continue to do
   so as his health will permit.

   "The Rev. Mr. Huffman, P. B., expresses great anxiety to have the Rev.
   Dr. Redfield placed in his power. He exhibits an eagerness, totally
   unbecoming a minister of the gospel, to see his anticipated victim
   writhing under the tortures of the modern inquisition.

   "We trust that he may find himself disappointed.

   "For the withdrawal from Ebenezer of the large numbers of members that
   have left, we do not consider that Dr. Redfield is in the least
   responsible. We have our own views as to where the blame rests, but, at
   present, accuse no one.

   "There is room enough in this large and wicked city for both the old
   and new organizations to live and labor for the salvation of souls.
   Crimination and recriminations can do no good. Let us employ our
   strength in peace and harmony, in building up the Redeemer's kingdom.

   "From our intercourse with Dr. Redfield, we are satisfied that he is a
   holy man, devoted entirely to the service of Christ. He preaches with
   apostolic zeal, eloquence and power, and we most cordially commend him
   to the confidence and sympathy of the Christian public, wherever he may
   bestow his evangelical labors.

   Committee:

   "H. Wickersham, Leader,

   "L. H. Cordry, L. P.,

   "Henry Stephens, L. P.,

   "Liberty Waite, Steward,

   "A. W. Harrison.

   "Ad. C. Caughlan, Steward,

   "Johnson Brooks, Leader,

   "Richard Thornton, L. D.,

   "and one hundred members."

   Before Mr. Redfield started for Quincy, a friend handed him a copy of
   the paper with the article his energies had published. This induced him
   to leave his wife, for the present, in St. Louis, as he did not know
   the reception he might receive in that place. With a heavy heart he
   started on his journey. The tempter beset him with questioning as to
   his course. He soliloquized thus: "What am I about? If I am right, why
   don't God stop this great wrong? Well, I don't know; I cannot see! I am
   an offense. I cannot help it. I am like a poor hunted animal, lodging
   the blows of it enemies. But still I'll try to work for God as well as
   I can."

   The next morning, after leaving St. Louis, he arrived at Quincy, and
   found the paper with that special request had preceded him. He was
   immediately waited upon, and asked if he would deposit his letter, and
   come to trial. He replied, "I am not willing to let my case be acted
   upon by such as know of the fraudulent letter, and connived at it. I
   can show you papers which will attest the truth of the whole matter.
   Now you can do as you please, but I do not feel it my duty to suffer
   all I have for these men, and then to begin a series of meetings here
   after having been tried for a crime which they have committed."

   But the president of the Methodist college, and the agent of the same,
   said, "We will go to St. Louis and find out all the facts."

   They returned in a few days, and said to Mr. Redfield, "We saw only the
   men who are pursuing you, and we knew from their own mouths that the
   whole matter of the disturbance is with, and caused by, them. So you
   have our confidence, and can go to work."

   While Mr. Redfield was waiting for their return, the lady with whom he
   boarded related to him the following experience:

   "Brother, I have lived here seventeen years. I have felt it to he my
   duty to work for God. I have seen one church, among the Germans, built
   up, and become a Bethel for souls. And we have two American Methodist
   churches. About five years ago, I got to feeling so bad over the low
   state of religion, that one night, after meeting, I took a by street to
   go home, so I could cry aloud, and ask God what was to be done. That
   night he showed you to me in a dream, and told me you would come and
   preach the gospel in its power. And as soon as I saw you I knew you,
   and remembered my dream."

   Mr. Redfield remarks in connection with this account, "All this was
   very consoling to my wounded heart. But for these occasional instances
   of revelation to God's people, I think I should have given up the
   struggle."

   He now went to work, and God came in glorious power in the salvation of
   souls. A Baptist clergyman, an honest, earnest seeker after what he
   called "the higher life," soon entered into the experience. One day,
   when Mr. Redfield was out visiting, he was sent for by a sister of the
   church, who was in great distress of mind. Several were with her, and
   were engaged in prayer, when he arrived. She would walk the floor,
   throw herself flat upon it, wring her hands, and cry, and whenever the
   praying would cease, she would scream out, "Oh, do, do pray every
   moment, for I cannot live." The friends prayed until they were
   exhausted. Mr. Redfield had been quietly watching her in the meanwhile,
   and at last said,

   "Sister, hold on a moment."

   But she cried out, "Why don't you pray?"

   He said to her, "You are not ready for prayer. Now, do you say, if the
   Lord will bless you, any way?"

   "Oh;" said she, "that is the difficulty. I am not willing to be
   singular."

   "Well, if God will save you, do you say, any way, Lord?"

   Soon she broke out, with, "Any way, Lord."

   He said, "Say it louder"; and she repeated it at the top of her voice.
   In a few minutes she was so filled with joy that her shouts of praise
   aroused the people of the entire block.

   In the following letter, written at this time, Mr. Redfield opens his
   heart and mind to our gaze:

   "Quincy, Ill., March 30, 1859.

   "Dear Brother and Sister Foot --Your letter came to hand this
   afternoon, re-mailed from St. Louis.

   "I have been here two weeks next Saturday. Mattie will come up tomorrow
   or next day. I send you a paper, the St. Louis Christian Advocate, a
   Southern paper, which will set that matter of the Central Advocate
   right. I have likewise papers, signed by about one hundred persons,
   stating the facts concerning the church difficulties. The depths of
   corruption which have come to light by the acts of the few men who have
   tried to father on to me the fruits of their own wrong, will put them
   in a very unenviable light at the next conference. The city of St.
   Louis, churches and outsiders, seeing the wrong and the persecutions of
   these men, have offered and are now preparing to build a church at a
   cost of about $20,000 -- lot and all. A brother was up here yesterday
   to negotiate for the brick.

   "They are still having salvation power in the new church. Mattie
   reports, that Sunday before last, six were converted in a single class
   meeting, and a number sanctified. They have now six classes, and a
   Sunday School of more than two hundred, and very flourishing. More or
   less are joining, at almost every meeting. They say salvation was never
   in the city before in power like this.

   "The first week after the publishing of that article in the Central
   more than fifty of the subscribers stopped taking it. The city carriers
   have refused to take it, as, they say, so many refuse to take it
   longer. That shows what the people in St. Louis think. Two of the first
   ministers of this conference (the Illinois) have been down to St.
   Louis, and took the reports from the men who published that article,
   and they say those men are condemned out of their own mouths; and
   assure me that I have their confidence and sympathy, and shall have
   their support. So I feel that I have nothing more to do with the
   matter. I shall keep on serving God and doing all the good I can amid
   this persecution. It is hard enough to be without home, and away from
   friends, and to meet the powers of darkness, of the world, and
   infidels; but if my track lies amid perils by sea and by land, and
   false brethren, yet God will not excuse me.


   "The way may be rough,

   But it will not be long.

   "We are having conflicts here, but glorious victories also.

   "A goodly number have entered into the rest of perfect love. Two
   Baptist preachers have attended some of the meetings and are earnestly
   seeking holiness. They came to my boarding house to talk with me and
   pray over the matter today. They said they would pay the cost. One
   said, "By faith I can see men as trees walking, and I never knew
   anything like this before." The other says he will not yield until he
   knows the fullness for himself; and then he will preach it if he is
   turned away from Quincy. Bless the Lord! The work is spreading all over
   the place, and into nearly all the churches. Hallelujah to the Branch!

   "The dear, good sister where I stay, is a pilgrim indeed, She has stood
   nearly alone for fourteen years, weeping and praying over this wicked
   city. Five years ago, she says, God showed her the man whom he would
   send here to work; and she says, "When I first saw you, I remembered
   the dream in which I saw you." Oh, how this did comfort me amid my
   fight "with the beasts of Ephesus." Right, or not, such things do
   encourage me.

   "The people in St. Louis insisted upon it, that we must not leave them
   this summer. They think, if the work keeps moving as it now does, they
   will have at least three churches of a salvation stamp, in two or three
   years. Next Sabbath they are to have their first general quarterly
   meeting, after the manner of such meetings in Western New York. One of
   the preachers from the East is with them now, and they expect another
   to take his place soon.

   "The society goes in strong for Northern Methodism, and organized on
   the Discipline of 1842. It is said that one of the bishops has said,
   the society will be recognized, although those men who have fought us
   say they will leave the conference it that is done. But we shall see.

   "I was never more sure that God sent us to that city of sin. It did
   seem that it would crush me for awhile, and I was laid up sick for two
   weeks with the burden and trouble. "But having obtained help of God, I
   continue to his day," preaching the same gospel, and having the same
   Jesus to help me. My dear Mattie has stood by me like an angel of
   mercy; and when I felt like fainting, she seemed to possess the courage
   of a hero, and insisted upon it that we should not quit the field, but
   have victory or die in our tracks. God has given the victory. If
   Mattie's health permits we shall visit St. Charles this season, the
   Lord permitting. Then we can give you all the interesting details,
   which are too tedious to write.

   "The people here are urgent that we shall make this place our home this
   summer, but I don't know. We have two more new places open, as soon as
   we get through here, where the ministers knew me East, and know all
   about the St. Louis troubles. They are very urgent that we carry the
   same word of salvation into their places.

   "Oh, how I want to see you all at St. Charles. Please give my love to
   all; tell them to pray for us. If ever we needed prayers it is now. We
   are kicked on one side, and patted on the other. We need humility to
   bear the one, and courage to meet the other, -- especially when we get
   into the unfortunate fix of the poor fellow who went down from
   Jerusalem to Jericho. We have had the worst squall that we ever got
   into. But thank the Lord, salvation has got into St. Louis, and I think
   it will take years for the devil to get out; and in that time a goodly
   host will pass safely over,

   "Love to all.

   "J. W. Redfield
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 58

   Subsequent events proved the wisdom of Mr. Redfield's refusal to submit
   to trial by the Ebenezer quarterly conference. The trial of a number of
   local preachers took place, which developed the policy of the
   administration. The trials of two were postponed from time to time,
   until the sickness of one and the business of the other prevented them
   from attending, and then they were published as having refused to
   appear. Another was tried, and cleared, and when his character was
   "passed," he asked for his letter, and united with the new society.
   Another local preacher, whose drunkenness had been a great scandal to
   the church, had his license renewed after signing the temperance
   pledge.

   Mr. Redfield had now taken his letter again, and for the time being put
   it in the keeping of a minister in the church South, thinking the
   mutual jealousies of the two churches would make that a safe asylum for
   the time being. But Dr. Williams was constantly on the search for it,
   finally discovered it, and immediately published Mr. Redfield as having
   compromised his antislavery principles. This drew letters in large
   numbers from all parts of the country, asking for explanations. But
   what was painful to him was that some staunch friends for this cause
   now forsook him. Among these was ex-Bishop Hamline. Down to this time
   their friendship had been close. and Mr. Redfield had received much
   encouragement from the good man. Often, fields of labor had opened to
   him through the bishop's influence. For some reason, probably from the
   evil reports then in circulation, their fellowship was broken. But a
   few years elapsed before they both had passed away, and doubtless in
   heaven mutual explanations have been made, and t hey have entered into
   a fellowship to be no more broken. During the Summer following, Mr.
   Redfield went East, on a visit, and met with handbills, stating that he
   and the new society in St. Louis were slaveholders, and belonged to the
   Southern Methodist church. From this time he found his way in the
   Methodist Episcopal Church almost entirely closed.

   In the autumn of 1858, Rev. Seymour Coleman, a superannuated preacher
   of the Troy Conference, settled in Aurora, Illinois. For many years he
   had been noted for the advocacy of the doctrine and experience of
   holiness. This was his theme, and his preaching was in great simplicity
   and power. He has the honor of being the first Methodist preacher who
   invited seekers of holiness to the altar for prayer. At his next
   conference his character was arrested by his presiding elder, for so
   doing.

   Mr. Coleman had attended most of the laymen's camp meetings in Western
   New York, and knew the "pilgrims" well.

   In the spring of 1859, a vacancy occurred in the pulpit or the First
   church, in Aurora, and he was employed to fill it until the ensuing
   conference. Almost immediately the Spirit of God began to be poured out
   upon the Aurora church, and large numbers of the membership entered
   into the experience of perfect love, and a general awakening among the
   unconverted soon became apparent. His first more public appearance was
   at the district camp meeting held near Sycamore in De Kalb Co. At this
   camp meeting were large numbers from Marengo, Woodstock, Elgin and St.
   Charles, who had been brought into the experience of perfect love
   through Mr. Redfield's labors. There were visitors also from long
   distances, who were full of holy fire, and ready for work. Mr. Coleman
   was invited to preach the opening sermon. In this he pitched the
   keynote for the entire meeting. Full salvation was the theme, and all
   the full salvation folks walked out in glorious liberty. Mr. Coleman
   preached again Friday afternoon, on the Vine and the Branches. In this
   sermon he handled the timid and the unsound theologians in the church
   "without gloves." During the sermon he gave expression to the
   following:

   "I understand there are preachers in this country, who are afraid of
   the Bible terms, sanctification, holiness, perfect love clean heart,
   and talk about "a little more religion," "a deeper work of grace," etc.
   The Lord pity the poor things. Jesus has said, "Whosoever shall be
   ashamed of me, and my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation,
   of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of
   the Father with the holy angels." Presiding Elder H_____, gently pulled
   Father Coleman's coat, as a check to such severity, but the old man,
   with a dignity and almost majesty of manner, that thrilled all who
   observed it, turned and laid his hand upon the elder's head, and said,
   "It will not hurt you, elder." At the close of the sermon, Father
   Coleman was about to sit down, when the elder told him to go on. He
   then turned back to the congregation, and asked to have the whole altar
   cleared. The altar was one of the old-fashioned kind, with a railing
   around to keep off the crowd from the seekers and laborers. In a
   moment, almost, the whole altar was cleared. He then asked for seekers
   for holiness; and, about as quick, the place was filled again, until
   only two persons could get in to labor with the seekers. More than 150
   were on their knees consecrating all to Christ.

   Many of the ministers present were astonished at the power of the truth
   of a full salvation to move and bless the people. The evidence of the
   divine approval of preaching the doctrine was apparent to all.

   While a group of Christians were talking together of the wondrous scene
   a little while after, a gentleman approached, and said, "I saw the old
   man this forenoon far out in the grove stretched flat on the ground,
   with his coat and vest off, struggling in prayer; and again, since
   dinner, I went out, and he still was there engaged in prayer." This
   explained it all.

   The next morning the love-feast started off in glorious power. Many
   were the testimonies to entire sanctification. Some would say, "Thank
   God, three years ago," or "two years ago," or "one year ago," "I saw
   the light." This meant when Mr. Redfield came into this section. These
   testimonies seemed to disturb the presiding elder much. At last,
   apparently in great indignation, he arose, and said:

   "Brethren, you are doing us preachers a great wrong. You talk as though
   this was a new thing. But we have been preaching it all these years. I
   thank God that three weeks after my conversion I was led to the altar
   by my mother, though I was only nine years old, and there and then I
   consecrated myself wholly to God. It has cost me many a struggle to
   keep all on the altar, but by the grace of God I have been enabled to
   do so."

   A sister Irvine, the wife of one of the conference preachers, a
   contributor to the Ladies' Repository, and an advocate of holiness, was
   present, and her swift pencil took down the elder's testimony, and the
   next week it appeared in the Northwestern Christian Advocate.

   But there were on the camp ground, a brother Bishop and his
   brother-in-law, Fairchild, the latter a local preacher, who were
   differently moved by the testimony than most others who heard it. At
   noon, when they came together in their tent, the following conversation
   took place:

   "What do you think of the elder's testimony?"

   "I don't know what to make of it."

   "When he came to our first quarterly meeting in Woodstock, last fall,"
   said the local preacher, "I asked him at the close of his Saturday
   afternoon sermon, if he enjoyed the blessing of holiness, and he
   answered, "No; but I am seeking it; and I want the friends to pray for
   me." "

   "But," said Father Bishop, "at our last quarterly meeting at
   Franklinville, on Sunday-morning, he preached against the use of the
   technical terms, sanctification, etc. Monday morning I felt so badly
   about it, I went to the parsonage to talk with him about it. He then
   told me he had "been reading Mattison on the subject, and had grown
   skeptical."

   In the minds of these brethren and those who listened to them, there
   was great confusion as to what the elder meant by that testimony.

   In the city of Aurora, the work of holiness went forward with great
   power under the labors of Father Coleman. Here were strong men who
   stood by the doctrine and experience; and whose hearts were loyal to
   God. Some of these had entered into the experience and others had not.

   In August, a camp meeting was held near Aurora, which was largely
   attended by the lovers and advocates of holiness. Benjamin Pomeroy was
   there from New York state, but for some reason did not get free, and
   failed to make much impression. Father Coleman was at his best. How he
   preached, and how he prayed! Dr. T. M. Eddy, editor of the Northwestern
   Christian Advocate, preached Sunday morning. The only minister who felt
   free to follow him in the afternoon was Father Coleman, who preached
   from "Tarry ye at Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on
   high." It was a characteristic discourse. There was no comfort in it
   for an unfaithful and cowardly ministry; there was much that gave
   offense to the fastidious and time-serving; but God was glorified.

   About five o'clock two prayer meetings were started, one in a large
   Aurora tent, led by Father Coleman, and the other in a St. Charles
   tent, led by a boy preacher. God came in great power, and many were
   saved. Among the rest who attended this meeting was the Hon. Benjamin
   Hackney, of Aurora. He had been converted but a short time, and under
   the preaching of Father Coleman, had come to see the doctrine of
   holiness clearly, but had not yet entered into the experience. Sunday
   evening, just before the preaching service, he was walking back and
   forth across the grounds in meditation, when he met Father Coleman, and
   said, "Father Coleman, I've got everything upon the altar; what shall I
   do next?"

   "Oh, just leave it there," said the old veteran, and passed on.

   Mr. Hackney resumed his walk, and his meditations. But to himself he
   said, "Well; that is a strange way to treat a man! Why did he not try
   to help me? Perhaps that is the way to do. Well; I'll do that." He
   continued his walk, thinking and praying, and waiting upon the Lord.
   Little by little his faith took hold, and little by little came the
   peace of believing. The assurance began to spring up in his heart, and
   at last he was enabled to say:


   "Tis done, thou dost this moment save,

   With full salvation bless.

   Redemption through thy blood I have,

   And spotless love and peace."

   The next day was a busy one with him up town in his office, and on the
   campground, looking after his own tent, and a number of others he had
   provided for those who could not provide for themselves, and he had no
   opportunity to testify in public. It was the same on Tuesday, until the
   meeting broke up. In the afternoon while quite a company was waiting
   for a train, and he was superintending the removal of the tents under
   his care, an impromptu service was held in the altar. After awhile Mr.
   Hackney arose and testified. He said:

   "I have dealt in railroad stocks, and canal stocks, and bank stocks,
   and state stocks, and in all kinds of stocks, but I never got hold of
   anything that yields such dividends as the stock I have in Jesus."

   In a few days another camp meeting commenced on the old ground near
   Coral. Here the holiness people were out in force. Elder Crews again
   had charge, and Mr. Redfield was present to preach and help on the
   battle. A wonderful spirit of prayer prevailed. At almost every hour of
   the day, the woods were vocal with the sound of prayer. A Rev. N. P.
   H_____ preached the Sunday morning sermon. It was a strained effort to
   do a great thing. In the afternoon Mr. Redfield preached, in his
   characteristic manner. While touching upon the subject of dress, the
   Rev. H_____ was evidently disturbed, and pointing towards Mr.
   Redfield's back, said, "But he wears buttons on the back of his coat."

   These three camp meetings greatly strengthened the holiness people, and
   as greatly exasperated their enemies. In the city of Aurora lived Rev.
   A_____d, the presiding elder of Chicago District, who held to the
   development theory of sanctification. He became greatly stirred over
   the growth of the holiness sentiment, and the spread of the work. The
   First church desired Father Coleman to supply them another year; but
   Elder A_____, though it was not within his jurisdiction, said, "He
   shall not supply a pulpit in Aurora, if it shuts every church, store
   and shop in the city."

   Elder Crews, of the Rockford District, took to the conference the
   recommendations of Edward P. Hart and I. H. Richardson, both from the
   Marengo Quarterly Conference. Elder H_____, of the St. Charles
   District, opposed both of them, because, as he said, they were tainted
   with Redfieldism. In his speech against their reception, he said:
   "Redfieldism has nearly driven me from my district during the year." He
   was the presiding elder whose testimony created such a sensation at the
   Sycamore camp meeting in June.

   One fact should be borne in mind, namely, that in all these conflicts,
   East and West, the opposition to these holiness workers came from men
   who did not hold clearly to the doctrine of entire sanctification as a
   distinct experience.

   But to return to the session of the Illinois Conference. It was argued
   by some, that as Mr. Hart was a young man, he might be cured of his
   Redfieldism, but Mr. Richardson was too old for that. Mr. Hart was
   admitted, and Mr. Richardson was rejected.

   Rev. D. D. Buck, a presiding elder of the Minnesota Conference, had
   been present, listening to all that was said, pro and con, against Mr.
   Richardson, and after the adjournment for the day, went to him, and
   putting his arm around him, invited him to come to Minnesota to his
   district, for he had a place for him. Mr. Richardson went to Minnesota,
   and became a useful and successful minister of the gospel.

   They were greatly mistaken in Mr. Hart, for they were unable to cure
   him of Redfieldism, and he is still tainted with it, and spreads it
   wherever he goes, as one of the general superintendents of the Free
   Methodist Church.

CHAPTER 59

   During the following August, the writer, then a local preacher, was
   invited by the local preachers of Mt. Pleasant circuit, to assist them
   in revival meetings. The invitation was accepted, and immediately after
   the Coral camp meeting I went to that place. I found the preacher
   appointed by the conference, had been obliged to resign because of ill
   health, and the work was being supplied by the local help. The meeting
   was held in a large country church, in a thickly-settled farming
   community. From the first the interest was strong, and the meeting
   increased constantly in power. At the end of the second week the
   newly-appointed preacher came on, but refused to take part in the
   meetings until he was moved and settled. Being in poor health and in
   need of help, and knowing Mr. Redfield, I was requested to write for
   him to come. A letter was at once forwarded to a friend, inquiring for
   Mr. Redfield's address. The letter was taken to Mr. Redfield at St.
   Charles, where he was awaiting the result of an effort to get him an
   opportunity to hold a meeting in that place. He answered at once,
   saying he would come on the following conditions:
    1. "That the preacher in charge of the circuit requests it."
    2. "That I can go straight on the Bible and the Discipline."
    3. "That the preacher in charge will take hold of said work with me."

   When his letter was received at Mt. Pleasant, it was taken immediately
   to the preacher in charge, who replied, "I want him to come; I want him
   to be Dr. Redfield; I will take hold with him and do the best I can." A
   letter was now written to Mr. Redfield to come, indorsing the words of
   the preacher in charge. He arrived on Wednesday.

   That night he preached and the preacher in charge sat back in the
   congregation near the door. The text was, "For he that will save his
   life shall lose it, but he that will lose his life for my sake, and the
   gospel's, the same shall save it."

   The congregation was large, and very attentive. Many had complained of
   my preaching, but now they heard what they never had heard before. The
   truth came with such vividness and strength, and was attended with such
   an unction of the Holy One, that Christians were compelled to look over
   their hopes, and sinners were in amazement.

   About thirty had been converted, and fifteen had entered the experience
   of perfect love. One of the latter, then a Class Leader, but since a
   traveling preacher, was put on such a searching of heart that for eight
   days he dared not profess to be a Christian.

   At the close of the sermon Mr. Redfield sat down, and turned the
   meeting over to me. I arose, and asked for seekers; but none came.
   There had been fifteen the night before. Then the church members were
   asked to come forward for a prayer meeting; but not a person came.
   Opportunity was then given for any to speak; but none embraced it.
   After offering prayer, I dismissed the meeting. Immediately I was
   surrounded by members of the church, who asked, "Is this going right?"
   I replied, "Yes; you look to the Lord."

   The next night Mr. Redfield preached more strongly still. The interest
   was intense. The pure truth in its searching power came upon the mind
   and heart with marvelous clearness. There was no playing upon the
   sympathies or passions of the people, but the most honest dealing with
   the understanding and the conscience. Toward the close of the discourse
   the feeling of the audience may be described as awful. When he had
   finished, he said, "While I sing two short-meter verses, if any one
   will forsake the world and come out on the Lord's side, come." He sang
   to the tune "Shawmut," the words,


   "And can I yet delay,

   My little all to give?

   To tear myself from earth away,

   For Jesus to receive?"

   At first the congregation attempted to sing with him, but he desired
   them to think. To bring this about, he varied the tune and the words,
   and repeated both, until every voice but his own was hushed. He then
   sang the second verse with great sweetness and power:


   "Nay, but I yield, I yield,

   I will hold out no more;

   I sink by dying love compelled,

   And own Thee conqueror.

   Not a person had moved. He then said, "Perhaps some one has a
   confession to make." No one responded to this. He then pronounced the
   benediction, and the congregation dispersed in great quietness.

   Many came to me and asked, "Is this going right?" to whom I answered,
   "Yes; you look to the Lord."

   The next night the truth seemed to come with still greater power than
   the night before. The house was packed to its utmost capacity. Every
   eye was fixed intensely upon the speaker. The minds of the people were
   led to the judgment scene, and made to look over the acts of the life
   and the feelings of the heart under the light of God. The people began
   to lean toward the speaker; here and there one rose to his feet. A
   deathly pallor spread over every face. But all was still, save the
   preacher's voice, which, in measured tones, with great clearness and
   distinctness, pronounced the truth that arraigned all at the bar of
   God. At the close of the sermon, more than twenty were standing on
   their feet, while the very hush of the congregation was painful. He
   closed, and gave the invitation. The congregation arose, and before a
   word could be sung, there was a simultaneous rush from all parts of the
   house toward the altar, with wailing and lamentations, and scream for
   mercy. There could be no orderly praying, but every one broke out for
   himself. Christians, and backsliders, and sinners, were mingled. More
   than eighty had come as penitents. One of the most fastidious of ladies
   came screaming most disagreeable hallelujahs; and continued them after
   she reached the altar. It awakened my curiosity, and I watched her with
   much interest. At last she screamed out, "There; I've said I'd go to
   hell before I'd shout." In an instant the power of God fell upon her.
   Her hallelujahs were changed to the sweetest tones. She rose to her
   feet, and flew about the house, shouting "Hallelujah" as she went.

   So great was the feeling among the seekers that it was about impossible
   to instruct them, or even to gain their attention. Now and then, with
   shining face, one would spring to his feet to tell what Christ had done
   for him; but the screaming for mercy by those still seeking, drowned
   their voices. Thus the meeting went on until a late hour. Finally the
   seekers, from sheer exhaustion, quieted down, and the service was
   closed.

   Up to this time there had been no opportunity even to introduce the two
   preachers. Each night the preacher in charge had seated himself in the
   rear of the congregation, and when the service closed, would
   immediately leave the house. But now, after the service closed, he came
   forward and was introduced. It is quite possible that if Mr. Redfield's
   effort had been a failure, he would not have come forward at all. He
   said, "I have taken no part in these meetings heretofore, but now I
   will be on hand every night to assist." Turning to me, he said, "I will
   take charge of the prayer meeting, before preaching tomorrow night, and
   you take charge of it after the preaching. Hereafter we will alternate
   in that manner."

   On the way to our lodgings, I remarked to Mr. Redfield. "Doctor, that
   was glorious."

   "Oh, but we must go forty feet deeper yet!" he exclaimed.

   The next night, Saturday, the preacher in charge was on hand, and in a
   very systematic manner took charge of the prayer meeting before
   preaching.

   The scene during the remainder of the evening, the matter and manner of
   the discourse, and the results, were similar to those of the evening
   before. It seemed as though the forty feet deeper stratum was reached.
   On the way home, I again remarked, "Well, that was glorious!"

   "We must go ten feet deeper yet," said Mr. Redfield, in a very
   impulsive manner.

   Sunday morning came. A testimony meeting for an hour before preaching
   gave an opportunity for any to speak freely. Some very humiliating
   confessions were made, and some very clear experiences related. The
   sermon was in the same line of those which had preceded it. An altar
   service lasted until two o'clock. Many were converted, and many entered
   into the experience of perfect love; among them the invalid preacher of
   the year before.

   In the evening the house was filled, and many could not get in. A
   deathly stillness pervaded the congregation while Mr. Red field
   preached. There was the same rush to the altar as on the preceding
   nights. The preacher in charge stepped forward to take the management
   of the prayer meeting. But when he wanted them to pray, somebody wanted
   to speak, and when he wanted them to speak, somebody wanted to pray. He
   became greatly excited, hurried from one end of the altar to the other,
   and at last turned to me and inquired, "How do you do it? How shall I
   manage it?"

   "Let it manage itself," I replied.

   "Is that the way?" he asked.

   He quietly dropped out, and took no active part in the meetings after
   that.

   On Monday night, Mr. Redfield preached on the Way of Faith. But he saw
   before the service closed, that the subject was premature. He went
   groaning all the way home. He remarked as we entered the house, "We
   must go sixty feet deeper yet. In such meetings, you must go down,
   down, down, until all is broken up; then the work will go of itself if
   there is not a preacher within forty miles."

   The next night, the plow of truth went in deeper than at any time
   before. How the power of God came with it! A doctor of medicine by the
   name of Roe, had been listening to the truth night after night but had
   made no move. He was a member of the church, but wholly backslidden.
   During the altar service he was heard screaming for mercy with all his
   might; and was found rolling upon the floor in great agony. He was a
   large man, with a powerful voice, which soon drowned all others. He at
   last began to confess that he had been called to preach the gospel, but
   had run away from duty. Late in the evening he found peace.

   One night, Mr. Redfield preached a discourse of marvelous eloquence.
   His subject was, the Final Catastrophe of Earth. He drew a vivid
   picture of the earth with its inhabitants; the various elements of the
   earth subject to their Maker, performing their offices, men engaged in
   their various avocations, when, in an instant, at the bidding of
   Jehovah, the falling rain became drops of fire, the rivers, and the
   lakes and the oceans, all liquid flame, etc., etc. A student, who was
   preparing for the law, who sat on the front seat, said afterwards, he
   found himself looking upward to see the drops fall; and many in the
   congregation thought the time had come.

   Another passage in the sermon was as follows:

   "Suppose, that in the judgment, your soul and your body should be
   remanded to the grave, there to be confined forever, with no want, from
   cold, or heat, or hunger, or thirst, but only this, "I want to get
   out." And when age after age has gone by, and the confinement has
   become almost unendurable, you cry out in your anguish, "How long, O
   Lord, must I lie here?' and back should come the answer, "Eternity!
   eternity!" And age after age again goes by, and you cry out, "How long,
   O Lord, how long?' and the answer comes, "Eternity! eternity!" You
   would jump into a hell of liquid fire to be free."

   Mr. Redfield was with us two weeks and then returned to St. Charles.
   During this time he had won a permanent place in the affections of
   every fully consecrated man and woman, and every young convert. With
   weeping eyes they bade him good-by the last night.

   The meeting continued for three weeks longer, ending in a quarterly
   meeting. The presiding elder took great pains to explain to the saints
   when they should say amen, and when they should shout, but his motive
   was so apparent, and his instructions so void of spiritual wisdom, that
   they failed to make any permanent impression.

   We now began to note the permanent fruit of the meeting. More than one
   hundred had been converted, and about seventy-five had experienced
   perfect love.

   The Sunday night after Mr. Redfield left, Mr. F_____, the preacher in
   charge, preached with unusual liberty for him. When the invitation was
   being given for seekers, a lady who had lately been converted, and then
   sanctified a few days after, went to him and asked him to go forward as
   a seeker; but he repulsed her. With a scream she fell to the floor in
   great agony. A large number came forward, and the prayer meeting
   commenced. When the service had closed, as I turned to prepare for
   leaving the house, the lady referred to, who was still prostrate on the
   floor, cried out to me, "He says you set me at him." This arrested the
   attention of the congregation, the greater part of which remained to
   see what it meant. In the pulpit, on the floor, reclined Mr. F and the
   invalid preacher in consultation about something. In answer to my
   inquiry as to what the difficulty was, the latter replied, "Brother
   F_____ is in an awful state if he did but know it." Aware that my name
   had been mentioned in connection with the case, I refrained from saying
   anything further. In a few moments Mr. F_____ arose, stepped forward to
   the desk, and began an explanation. The lady, who was still prostrate
   on the floor, evidently in burden for him, cried out, "You have a
   confession to make." He then said, "I have been very angry since these
   meetings have been in progress. One night when passing out of the
   house, I said in the hearing of several persons, "It makes me mad to
   see how these preachers act; and a sinner near me said, "If that is so,
   you had better go forward for prayers."

   "You have not confessed all," said the burdened sister.

   The preacher continued, "I have been in the habit of writing for mere
   literary papers to piece out my salary; and my articles have not been
   of a character consistent with my call to the Christian ministry. I see
   now I have done wrong in this; I must stop it; I will."

   "There, that will do," said the burdened sister.

   It was now eleven o'clock, and the entire congregation was still
   waiting to see the end. He now went down into the altar, and asked the
   prayers of the congregation.

   Some of the membership who had stood aloof from the work, and whose
   character for consistent piety was not the best, now gathered around
   him, and began to pray for, and to talk to him. I finally interfered,
   and said, "You had better keep still, and let Sister B_____ lead him.
   She can do more for him than any of us."

   Twelve o'clock came, and still his friends and the congregation were
   waiting for him. He now began to talk out his thoughts and feelings.
   "It is plain to me," he said, "that if I do not consent to take the
   track Dr. Redfield does, God will leave me." Some time elapsed, and his
   ministerial friend asked, "Brother F_____ what are you thinking about?"
   He replied, "I am thinking of what occupation I shall take up?"

   About two o'clock in the morning, he suddenly arose, and said to his
   wife, "Let us go." Sister B_____ and her husband went with them to
   their place of stopping, and as soon as he came from his room in the
   morning, she renewed her labors with him. He finally refused to go any
   further and in a short time became an opposer of the work. A few years
   after he left the Methodist Episcopal Church, and united with an
   unorthodox denomination.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 60

   On returning to St. Charles, Mr. Redfield found that the preacher in
   charge had taken a decided stand against his holding a revival meeting
   there. Among his reasons for so doing he said, "I have been sent here
   to guard the pulpit against Redfield and Coleman."

   "What have you against them?" was inquired.

   "Nothing," said he; "I believe them both to be good men; and they are
   doing good; but they must be sacrificed for the good of the church."

   When it became known that he had refused the pulpit to Mr. Redfield,
   some of the Baptist people suggested that he could have their pulpit,
   as their preacher was away. Accordingly, arrangements were made for Mr.
   Redfield to preach in their church for one Sunday, which he did morning
   and evening, to the delight of the pilgrims, and many outside the
   churches. Mr. Redfield was also invited to preach the following Sunday,
   to which he consented, and arrangements were made for it; but on
   Saturday, when too late to take up the appointment, his friends were
   informed that he could not have the pulpit. Mr. Howard, the Methodist
   pastor, had been to the officers of the church, and had presented the
   matter in such a light, that they withdrew their invitation. A trustee
   of the Universalist church, which was unoccupied at the time, overheard
   the conversation in regard to the Baptist pulpit, and immediately
   offered theirs. As it was too late to circulate the action of the
   Baptist people, this offer was accepted, and Mr. Redfield preached
   morning and evening in the Universalist church. As he would not leave
   the place for a few days, he also preached there Monday evening. Monday
   Mr. Howard went to Chicago to counsel with Bishop Simpson, who
   instructed him to call a meeting of the official board, and decide
   whether in its judgment the members who went to hear Mr. Redfield
   preach had withdrawn from the church, and if decided in the
   affirmative, he should read them out as having so withdrawn. He
   returned, and called together such of the official board as would
   follow his leadership, and they declared these members withdrawn. A
   majority of the official board, who were not present, nor knew of the
   meeting, were declared withdrawn, as well as five out of nine of the
   trustees of the church. Fourteen persons were thus declared withdrawn,
   though one of them, a brother's wife, was not a member of the church.

   Wednesday evening these persons, with no knowledge of what had
   occurred, went to the church prayer meeting as usual. But Mr. Howard,
   contrary to the usual custom in that church, announced that he would
   call on those he desired to have pray, and the old workers in the
   church were all left out. Sister Foot, a woman above sixty years of
   age, and more than ordinarily intelligent and cultivated, when she
   perceived the object of Mr. Howard, groaned aloud. He sprang to his
   feet and in a loud voice commanded her to be silent. Thinking she would
   be unable to control her sorrow, she arose and left the house; when
   outside the door, her feelings gave way and she cried aloud for God to
   have mercy.

   At the close of the prayer meeting, Mr. Howard read them out of the
   church. On Sunday morning this was repeated, and when the quarterly
   meeting came some time after, they were read out as withdrawn the third
   time.

   Under the laws of the state of Illinois, the office of a trustee of a
   religious corporation becomes vacant only by expiration, death, or
   resignation. Five of the persons read out were trustees, a majority of
   the board. Their places had to be declared vacant by resignation, as
   they were all alive, and their term of office had not expired. These
   men, none of them, resigned; therefore somebody had to make an
   affidavit before a magistrate, that they had resigned. But such was the
   heat of opposition to Mr. Redfield and his friends, that this was done.

   I returned to my home near Elgin that same week, and hearing that Mr.
   Redfield was holding meetings in St. Charles, I went there on Saturday.
   On the train I found a lay brother from Marengo on the same errand. We
   got off at Wayne Station, and walked across the fields to the house of
   John M. Laughlin; and who should open the door at our knock, but Mr.
   Redfield himself. As soon as be recognized us, he asked, "Are you ready
   to lose your heads?" We were seated and the matter was explained, as
   related in this chapter.

   A prayer meeting had been appointed at the house of Elisha Foote, a man
   seventy-five years of age, a Methodist for nearly fifty years, and a
   brother-in-law of Rev. John Clark, noted in Methodist history, as a
   missionary among the Indians. A wagon load of pilgrims from Mr.
   Laughlin's went to that prayer meeting. When we arrived the old man was
   offering the opening prayer. In it he compared the circumstances of the
   company to those of the children of Israel at the Red Sea, with the
   mountain on either hand, the sea before them, and the enemy behind; and
   he pleaded for divine guidance and help. The crying of the company
   could be heard out into the street. When he ceased, we opened the door,
   and to our astonishment, instead of fourteen, there were more than
   sixty present. This was more than half the membership of the church.

   The prayer meeting went on. Some time was spent in testimony, and save
   one exception, that in the old man's prayer, was the only allusion to
   the trouble, in the entire meeting. In the evening another prayer
   meeting was held in the same room. The company was larger than in the
   morning. Some more of the society, and some from the Baptist and
   Congregational churches, met with us. The same blessed spirit
   prevailed. This time there was not an allusion to the trouble. The
   bliss of a present salvation made them blessedly forgetful of it all.

   While Mr. Redfield was waiting here, he wrote the following letters
   which will explain themselves:

   "WAYNE STATION, October 20, 1859.

   "Dear Brother Rogers: -- We had a visit from Brother Coleman and wife
   yesterday. The conference refused to grant the petition of the First
   church of Aurora, to supply the pulpit with Brother Coleman. Presiding
   Elder A_____d said he should not go back, if it shut every store, and
   bank, and church in the city. Presiding Elder H_____k also said, "This
   stuff has got to be put down." But the people in Aurora say they will
   get a hall, or build a church; and Brother C_____ says if they do,
   he'll preach for them.

   "We have just heard from the Genesee Conference They have expelled at
   least three more, and probably will expel others before the conference
   closes. Well, bless the Lord! We expect Brother Roberts out here in a
   few days, and shall learn more of the particulars about the doings
   there.

   "The pilgrims here are anxious to have us hold a meeting, here this
   fall. But whether the preacher will allow it or not I cannot tell. I
   shall not ask him if the way opens.* [This was based upon a hope that
   the Baptists would invite him to hold a meeting] I shall obey God
   rather than man. We have good news from St. Louis. God is favoring Zion
   in the Sixth Street church. We shall stay here without doubt two weeks
   longer.

   "We learn that without doubt the Methodist preachers generally are
   going to follow the Genesee Conference, if they cannot in any other way
   put down this heresy, as they call it. But while Illinois is a free
   state for white men, I think I shall obey God rather than men; and keep
   going on as long as I can.

   "Give the pilgrims our love.

   "J. W. Redfield."

   "ST. CHARLES, Kane county, Ill.

   October 24, 1859.

   "My dear Sister Kendall: -- We have long wondered why the mails did not
   bring another of your very welcome letters, all of which we preserve
   with great care, and read over and over again to the precious pilgrims
   in this western world. But we have learned from Brother Roberts that
   you have been quite sick.

   "We have also learned of the infatuated conduct of the Genesee
   Conference toward those precious men, whose record of fidelity to God
   is recorded in the Book of Life. How my heart takes courage to breast
   the storm when I learn that men are found in this nineteenth century
   who, like Luther, can suffer, but cannot yield God's rights. These
   facts are green spots in the Sahara of formalism. A chord has been
   touched that vibrates to this far West, in many an honest pilgrim's
   heart. Yes, they feel the blow that struck Roberts and McCreery, and
   now has fallen on the heads of Stiles, Cooley Wells, and Burlingham.
   And you may confidently believe that hundreds in this region are in
   sympathy with these men of God. Already quite a number of prominent
   laymen have taken the stand of the Albion convention, that they will
   withhold supplies from ministers who oppose vital godliness. Some say
   they will use their money to help these proscribed men of God.

   "I am not surprised at the developments in the Genesee Conference. But
   they came sooner than I expected. I think our good and hopeful brethren
   will soon learn that the Methodist Episcopal Church will never wholly
   reform. The struggle has at last come. May God help us in love,
   kindness, and firmness to stand for the right.

   "We have just come from a most glorious revival, about sixty miles west
   of here. We witnessed old Bergen power beyond anything I have seen in
   the West before. Doors are opening all around, but there are many
   adversaries. The presiding elder on this district says this work must,
   and shall be, put down. Father Coleman, whom you know, took work in
   Aurora last year, as a supply, and, God was with him. The church sent a
   petition to conference to have him returned, but it was refused. Such
   is the spirit manifested by the authorities of the conference, that the
   people are thinking of getting a hall for him. The conference granted a
   similar petition from worldly men of a Universalist stamp for the
   return of Lyon, the little dandy from Buffalo, against the wishes of
   many in the society.

   "If Mattie's health will permit, we expect to go into one or two more
   battles in this section before we go South. The motto given Sister
   Roberts, "Go thorough, but hurry," I have adopted. I shall do all I can
   for Jesus until I am stopped. We shall look for you and Sister Hardy to
   visit the people in this region before long.

   "We desire more full details of the conference proceedings, and Brother
   Purdy's camp meeting. I learn, in a roundabout way, that they have
   cracked the whip in Brother Purdy's face. I am glad of it, for nothing
   but that will open his eyes to the fact that he has nothing to hope on
   the fence. I think, now, he will be likely to herd with the pilgrims,
   fight their battles, and share their persecutions.

   "The Lord bless you forever.

   "J. W. REDFIELD."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 61

   In a short time Mr. Redfield returned to St. Louis. The evening before
   he started was spent in company with the writer. No one else was
   present, Mrs. Redfield and the family with whom they were stopping
   being away at a prayer meeting. Mr. Redfield gave the entire evening to
   a review of his life work. It was more in the form of soliloquy, or
   thinking aloud, than a narrative. He dwelt much on the gloomy side. He
   spoke of place after place where he had labored, places where Methodism
   was nearly extinct, or struggling for an existence, where by the
   blessing of God he had been instrumental in increasing the membership
   until the societies were strong enough to support the other class of
   ministers, who would then go to work deliberately to destroy their
   peculiarly Methodistic character. After spending some time in this
   manner, during which for several minutes at a time the large tears
   would run down his face, he at last began to look on the brighter side.
   In Burlington, Vermont, he could name a few who were holding out firm
   and strong. In Syracuse, Rochester, and Albion, in New York state; in
   Appleton and Beaver Dam, Wisconsin; in Marengo, Woodstock, Elgin, Mount
   Pleasant, St. Charles, and Quincy, in Illinois; and St. Louis,
   Missouri, there were some tried and true. As he talked of them and the
   probability of their getting through to the skies, he became joyous in
   the extreme. This singular evening was concluded with prayer, in which
   he prayed for many of these pilgrims by name, with evidently a keen
   perception of their peculiarities and difficulties. Could those favored
   ones have been within hearing of that remarkable prayer, it would have
   been to them a matter of almost priceless value. It is not every one
   who has such a friend, or a friend in such communion and power with
   God.

   On their arrival at St. Louis, he found that disaster had overtaken the
   new society, and its membership reduced from two hundred and
   seventy-five to about one hundred. After he left them in the spring,
   they employed a man by the name of Dunbar to preach for them. He was
   the reputed author of the Sunday School hymn, titled, "A light in the
   window for thee." He came, and for a season his sensational style drew
   large crowds. He insisted upon the society going into larger quarters,
   at an expense of $1200.00 per year, and their paying him nearly as
   much; besides which he rented a theater for a Sunday afternoon
   appointment. Altogether, the financial burden became so great, that
   soon murmurs began to arise. Brother Wickersham, a careful, successful
   financier, in his own business, remonstrated. He thereby got in the way
   of this lofty man, and was crowded by him until he could endure it no
   longer, and he withdrew from the church. This caused others to do the
   same. The enthusiasm was checked; the revival spirit was lost. The
   society now refused to be led by this hair brained fellow; and then he
   left them, taking what would go with him to the Mariners' Bethel. In a
   few months he fled the city, and three or four years after he was
   arrested and tried on a charge of bigamy, and sent to the penitentiary
   in Minnesota.

   When Mr. Redfield saw the desolation this man had caused, he was nearly
   heartbroken. It so wrought upon his mind as to induce a slight stroke
   of paralysis. He was now obliged to cease entirely from all public
   labor for a season, and put himself under medical treatment. By spring
   he had so far recovered as to be able to preach again, but the society
   had lost its prestige, though those who had followed Dunbar returned.

   But the work in other parts was prospering.

   Three miles south of Elgin, on Fox River, was a village of about
   fifteen hundred inhabitants, then known as Clintonville. Years before,
   it had been a Methodist appointment, but long since had been abandoned.
   There were a few faithful Methodists living in and round about the
   place. Two local preachers, C. E. Harroun, the one saved in Mr.
   Redfield's first meeting in St. Charles, and D. F. Shephardson, went
   into the place and commenced a meeting. Soon the Spirit began to be
   poured out in great power and many were converted.

   The little band in St. Charles, which had been read out of the church,
   within a fortnight found their number to be about sixty, and that
   something must be done to provide for them. They rented some rooms on
   the ground floor of an unoccupied hotel, and by taking out some
   partitions, prepared and seated a place for worship, which would seat
   about two hundred people. The first Sunday in which they occupied it,
   the writer and another local preacher were present, and were invited to
   preach. At the close of the morning service, the writer was invited by
   this band to preach for them, and accepted the invitation. By the
   following March, they numbered one hundred and twelve.

   Rev. I. H. Fairchild, a local preacher belonging in Woodstock, invited
   the family of his brother-in-law, L. H. Bishop, to assist him in
   holding a protracted meeting at a country schoolhouse, where there had
   been no preaching for about fifteen years. He was no singer, while
   they, five in number, were all good singers, and could be of great help
   to him in the work. In a few weeks about forty had been converted, many
   of them heads of families.

   The question now arose at each one of these places, "What shall we do
   with the converts?" and Mr. Redfield was sought for advice. What the
   advice was and his reasons for it, can be best given in his own words.
   He says, "I well knew that we must now show our hand, if we meant the
   Methodist Church to see the need of permitting Methodists to enjoy
   Methodism. So I wrote to them for the first to keep every one, and
   organize under the Discipline as we had in St. Louis. This was being
   done in the East also, and I thought that it might lead the General
   Conference to meet in May of the next year, to correct the abuses from
   which we had suffered, reinstate the members and ministers who had been
   excluded, and give us guarantees that the preaching of living Methodism
   would be sustained."

   This advice was accepted, and three societies were organized; and
   waited the action of the General Conference in May.

   But there were some encouragements to Mr. Redfield amid all that he was
   called to suffer. Some good fruit remained, and some of the saints who
   had gone through the fire with him were passing away to their reward in
   clouds of glory that showed that the narrow way he had chosen led to
   joys immortal.

   The following account of the life and death of Mary Ferguson, of St.
   Louis, furnished by Mrs. T. S. La Due, formerly Mrs. Kendall, relates
   to one of these. She says:

   "Mary Ferguson was a favorite everywhere, welcomed alike by young and
   old in the church. No church party or sociable was considered complete
   without her wit and beauty. Pastors and presiding elders made her
   welcome to then families, the more as she was the only daughter of a
   widowed mother, and refined and very intelligent as a companion. Not
   one of them, she told me had ever treated her otherwise than as a
   perfect-creature ready for heaven at any hour.

   "Her beauty was uncommon, and her brothers and friends were anxious to
   see it set off in ornaments and gay apparel as the world judges of
   beauty. She needed none. Her graceful form, intellectual head, large,
   lustrious black eyes, with tender drooping lashes, glossy raven hair,
   parted smoothly back from a high, white forehead, delicately molded
   features, which usually wore a very thoughtful expression, needed no
   setting by human arts. "No minister or Class Leader had ever intimated
   to her that the ornaments she wore were not in keeping with her
   profession -- their own families wore them.

   "She had been taken into the church without a change of heart, or even
   conviction, which to all real Methodists means a putting off the old
   man so completely that by the power of the Holy Ghost the new man is
   put on, and as an evidence that Christ is within the fruits are seen.
   Up to the time she heard Dr. Redfield's searching sermons on the new
   birth, the crucifixion of self, the strait gate and the narrow way,
   Mary never had dreamed of such experiences as the right of the believer
   in Jesus. With other formalists, she gaily looked on, full of caviling
   and doubt.

   "She ventured in one day, however, to a social meeting with other
   church members. She was drawn by a love for the honesty and earnestness
   of the doctor's appeals. That day he was lead very clearly, he said, to
   pray for her as one who was stabbing Jesus to the heart, by giving the
   lie to her profession -- living, dressing, acting like a child of the
   devil, while solemnly pretending to be a child of God.

   "She was shocked, mortified, outraged that a minister should so dare to
   insult her before such a company. She declared she would never be found
   in his presence again; and when, after a few evenings, she was
   persuaded to hear him once more in the Sixth street church, near her
   mother's house, she was still so indignant that as he arose in the
   pulpit, she resolutely turned her back to the end of the pew that she
   might not see his face.

   "He had not proceeded far, however, when the truth came with such power
   that she said she was seized as by an invisible hand and wrenched
   around in her seat till she found herself gazing into his face, and
   felt the tears rolling down her cheeks, with neither power nor
   disposition to turn away. That night she was converted -- born again --
   and, for the first time in her life, tasted rest and everlasting joy.
   Oh, how she praised God that one minister had dared to deal faithfully
   with her soul. That prayer, which had roused all the slumbering
   rebellion in her heart had revealed her real condition and constrained
   her to fly to Christ and be saved. She hastened home, and told her
   mother. Stepping to the glass, she caught a glimpse of the long, white
   plume upon her hat. "Slowly and solemnly," her mother told me, she laid
   aside the hat, took off the plume, stripped the heavy gold rings from
   her fingers, unfastened the brooch at her throat, and the glittering
   pendants from her ears; then stepping to the grate, where a bright live
   was burning, laid the costly plume upon the glowing coals, and stood
   and watched it burn with evident satisfaction, saying to her mother,
   "Oh, how light I feel! The world is gone!"

   "Her mother, for a moment, feared she did not realize all she was
   doing, but was very soon reassured by her account of what the Holy
   Spirit had that evening written upon her heart.

   "She talked with members and ministers of her former inconsistent
   course of life, living like a mere butterfly of fashion, going the
   round of pleasure, sociable, party, ride, concert, etc., like a very
   child of the world, an utter stranger to the joys of everlasting life.

   "She told me she wrote very plain letters to those ministers who had
   been foremost in leading her into these gay scenes, expostulating with
   them for their lack of faithfulness, and warning them that unless they
   repented as she had, they must expect to wake up in the world of woe!
   These letters were never answered. One by one, old friends and
   flatterers forsook her, even ministers and presiding elders that ought
   to have rejoiced with her.

   "She had turned her back upon the world, and the world turned its back
   upon her. This gave her a fresh evidence that she was a child of God,
   and all alone in her chamber she settled it with the Lord, again, and
   again, that she would endure unto the end. As her consecration was
   tested and she did not waver, immortal joys were poured into her heart,
   such as she had never dreamed a mortal could know!

   "But consumption brought her to an early grave. Yet oh! the glory that
   was let down into that sick-chamber! I used to love to sit by her
   bedside and hear her tell of the visits from Jesus she was permitted to
   enjoy, in the long night watches. As pain increased and she was
   confined to her room, and only now and then one came in, to whom she
   could confide the joys and conflicts of her heart, Satan pressed her
   sore to complain, but she looked to Jesus, and power came to rejoice!
   There were times she said, when heavenly music was given to quiet her
   restless nerves. I think it was even so, for at times such an unearthly
   beauty would gather on her fair face, and the eyes glow with such
   spiritual depth and beauty as we talked of the things of God, and she
   tried to describe to me the strains of melody that floated down into
   her soul from the upper choir, that I felt like one entranced, such was
   the heavenly hush of sacred awe!

   "She said to Dr. Redfield one day, as he was leaving the city for a
   short time, and he was telling her of the many temptations he had to
   discouragement, on account of the murderous spirit that was roused in
   the M. B. Church, ministers and presiding elders publishing and
   threatening to arrest him, official members declaring if they could
   meet him on the street anywhere they would horsewhip him, etc., etc.
   "Doctor, you ought to praise God that you ever came to St. Louis, if
   only my soul is saved! I mean to endure to the end, and I may go soon
   -- I think I shall, and I want you to preach my funeral sermon. Tell
   them what I was saved from; and remember if I go first, and I am
   permitted, I will stand on the battlements of glory and be the first to
   hail you as you come up!" The Doctor promised to remember her request,
   and wept for joy to see such fidelity to God in one so young and so
   lately separated from all the world calls promising.

   "A few weeks after this, she fell asleep in Jesus, witnessing to the
   last, that she had no regrets in leaving the world. Jesus' image was so
   reflected, from her very countenance lit up with glory, and her calm,
   joyful messages to the brothers away, that no one ever doubted for a
   moment, but that she was ready, when Jesus called her to the mansions
   above.

   "She gave directions to her mother for the funeral, requesting as a
   favor, that there be no display beyond the presence of her Bible class
   as pall-bearers.

   "She desired to be laid out in a simple white mull, without flowers,
   except in her hand; and as was the custom for young people, in a plain
   white velvet coffin. Dr. Redfield was in the city, and preached as she
   had desired, dwelling much on the rich reward of those who are to "come
   up through great tribulation, having washed their robes and made them
   white in the blood of the Lamb."

   "To me it was the most glorious funeral I ever attended! Sorrow seemed
   to flee away, as the white coffin was borne down the aisle of the
   church to the front, and those twelve young ladies dressed in pure
   white, were seated around it, bearing a faint resemblance to the purity
   of her who had gone, and to the home where she was now safely housed
   forever and ever!

   "A large concourse of people were present. The brothers from a distance
   were there, who had been very proud of their sister while she was gay,
   and when they heard the account of her glorious conversion and happy
   death, and messages to them, trembled like stricken men, and were
   forced to acknowledge there was a reality in the religion of Jesus
   Christ. The Doctor was deeply affected as he gave the closing scenes of
   her life, and her last exhortation to him, to praise God if only she
   was saved as fruit of all his toil and suffering in spirit in St.
   Louis. Perhaps he remembered the counsels of his own sister Mary, who
   had so often encouraged him to endure unto the end! As the saints were
   singing at the close the favorite hymns of the pilgrims in those days,
   "We're going home to die no more," and the "Beautiful world," when they
   came to the chorus, "Palms of victory, crowns of glory, we shall wear
   in that beautiful world on high," the glory of God filled the place,
   and many who had been saved in the Sunday School were greatly blessed.
   The relatives kindly furnished a number of carriages, so that several
   of us could accompany the remains to their resting place in the
   cemetery six miles south of the city of St. Louis.

   "We gathered about her after she was tenderly laid away, and sang as a
   band of pilgrims traveling to the same home, that song again, over her
   grave, "Beautiful world"; and as often as we came to the refrain,
   "Palms of victory, crowns of glory, we shall wear in that beautiful
   world on high," waves of joy rolled over us as we thought that one more
   was added to "the innumerable company," "redeemed through the blood of
   the Lamb!" As we returned to the city, some of us were so blessed as we
   sang on our way, that several lost their strength in the carriages, and
   shouted loud hallelujahs! Never have I known of such a glorious funeral
   as that was, the first fruits unto God of Dr. Redfield's labors in the
   city of St. Louis. By several, it was thought to be a remarkable
   coincidence, that when Dr. Redfield received his final stroke of
   paralysis, that those in the room with him as he breathed his last,
   felt a strong and clear impression that Mary's spirit was indeed
   hovering near. Who knows but that she did come to the battlements, and
   looking over, send a salute down to hail the one who had dared to tear
   off the bandage from her eyes when closed by sin, and cause her so to
   see herself that she flew to the foot of the cross, gave up all
   forever, and was saved!"

   On February 14, 1860, Mr. Redfield wrote the following letter referring
   to events then occurring in various quarters:

   "Dear Brother and Sister Foot: -- "So greatly does my large
   correspondence press me that I am compelled to make one letter do for a
   place, or I should have written to you before. I learn by way of
   Brother Tyler of your prosperity. I am learning from various quarters
   where they have heard of the stand you have taken that the same thing
   for the same cause is contemplated. I feel deeply burdened at the
   melancholy sight of the Methodist Episcopal Church in arms against
   effective Methodism; and putting fidelity to Methodism down as a
   capital offense, and rending the church in an effort to rid it of
   soul-saving piety. I have long seen the tendency to this, and trembled
   at the threatening division, which must come if one party or the other
   would not abandon its position. But I saw clearly that if the pilgrim
   party compromised God's rights, and lowered the standard of piety at
   the demand of the other, all efficiency for soul-saving would be at an
   end, and our church would sink into a powerless formalism.

   "February 27.

   "You see by my dates that I have been interrupted. The fact is, we have
   been passing through a squall. Our preacher here proved to be well
   calculated to stir up strife, by going from one to another and
   retailing the stuff that our enemies invented. Both he and one of our
   leading men have been, and still are, trying to rend us in pieces. That
   man is bent on ruling or ruining us. But God is still with us, and
   though they have left and taken as many as they could persuade to go
   with them, trusting in God, we expect to live and enlarge our borders.
   We have a good and reliable membership, who are now engaged in planning
   for a new church. We expect that our late preacher will soon run his
   race and leave the city.

   "I have just received a call from Mt. Vernon, Iowa, to come, or send
   some one to preach the salvation that saves. The writer, a stranger to
   me, saw the report given of my connection with your affairs at St.
   Charles, and wrote to me for explanations. I answered, giving a full
   account of the matter. I have now received another letter stating that
   the same opposition had developed there, and for the same cause; and
   the faithful are now threatened with expulsion if they persist in
   praying for and exhorting the church. The spirit of the letter seems to
   be right, and as well as I can judge from its tone, and the manner of
   reporting the facts, that it is not a faultfinding spirit, but an
   honest desire to see the cause of God prosper.

   "I write this much to prepare the way to ask if Brother T_____ cannot
   go to their relief. At all events I wish he would write and learn the
   state of things, and get what items of information as may be needed to
   form an opinion as to what is best to be done. Please communicate with
   Brother T_____ about it.

   "Has Brother Cooley come yet? Brother Roberts wrote me that he would
   hasten him on, although he was greatly needed there. But they are
   careful to do nothing, more than they can help, to prejudice their case
   before the coming General Conference. After that, if nothing is done to
   make things right, a conference will be organized, and then your place
   will be provided for regularly.

   "Love to all.

   "J. W. Redfield."

   On March 26th, he wrote to Brother Rogers as follows;

   "I long to hear from you, and learn of the state of religion among you.
   We have been having a trying time here, but the Lord has conquered for
   us. We expect to go to work to build a new church at once.

   "This mighty work is rapidly spreading, and my calls are far more than
   I can accept. I expect from present appearances, that after the General
   Conference, we shall have another conference organized, which will
   carry the battle to the gates, and we shall see a great and glorious
   revival of genuine Methodism, carried on by local preachers. If the
   conference preachers will not go the way, in the name of the Lord, the
   local preachers will.

   "J. W. Redfield."

   April 6th, 1860, he writes again to Brother and Sister Foot, as
   follows:

   "Your welcome letter was duly received; but my large correspondence
   prevented me from answering until now. Every sentiment of my heart is
   enlisted in your behalf God is raising up a great people, and you in
   St. Charles have the honor and disgrace of standing foremost. I have
   written Brother Roberts to hold on, and not send a preacher to you
   until after the General Conference. It begins to look as though we will
   have to organize immediately after that, in a permanent form. I am
   greatly rejoiced that God has raised up a preacher for you. Please send
   a statement of your wants and condition to Brother Roberts.

   "I send you a number of circulars, and desire that all the pilgrims
   will give us at least ten cents each towards building a church here.
   The lot will cost $10,000. We want to build two more to meet the wants
   of this great city. But we are poor, and need help.

   "Yours,

   "J. W. Redfield."

CHAPTER 62

   A Laymen's Convention was called to meet in Olean, February 1 and 2,
   1860. As the principal members of the church in that place were in
   sympathy with the convention, it was designed to hold it in the
   Methodist church; but upon an application by a member of the church,
   Judge Green granted an injunction upon the trustees restraining them
   from, and forbidding them to, open the edifice for that purpose. With
   commendable liberality, the trustees of the Presbyterian church
   tendered the use of their house, which was accepted.

   At 10:00 o'clock, on Wednesday morning, Abner I. Wood, president of the
   convention held at Albion, December and 2, 1858, called the convention
   to order, and S. K. J. Chesbro, secretary, assumed the duties of his
   office. After prayer, the call for the convention was read. The first
   action of the convention was to provide for the administration of the
   Lord's Supper, by requesting Rev. Loren Stiles to officiate in the
   evening.

   When the names of delegates were handed in, it was found that every
   charge in the Genesee Conference was represented.

   A "Free Methodist Church" had been organized, and a delegate from that
   organization was invited to a seat in the convention.

   The following petition to the General Conference was adopted, and a
   committee of five was appointed to circulate it through the conference
   for signatures.

   "To the Bishops and Members of the General Conference of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, to be held in Buffalo, N. Y., May 1, 1860.

   "Reverend Fathers and Brethren: -- We, the undersigned, members of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, in the bounds of the Genesee Conference,
   respectfully represent to your reverend body, that a very unpleasant
   state of things prevails in the church throughout this conference. This
   difficulty has grown out of the action of the conference. Many honestly
   believe this action to have been wrong and oppressive. We, therefore,
   ask your reverend body to give to the judicial action of the Genesee
   Conference, by which six of the ministers, to wit: B. T. Roberts, J.
   McCreery, J. A. Wells, William Cooley, L. Stiles, and C. D. Burlingham,
   have been expelled from the conference and the church, a full and
   careful investigation, trusting you will come to such decision as
   righteousness demands. We also ask your reverend body so to amend the
   judicial law of the church, as to secure to the ministers and members
   the right of trial by an impartial committee."

   A petition to the General Conference asking for the insertion of an
   antislavery chapter in the Discipline was also adopted by the
   convention. The following is a copy of that petition:

   "Reverend Fathers and Brethren: -- Inasmuch as there are now known to
   be, in the slave states, many members of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church, who hold their fellow beings, and even then brethren in Christ,
   as slaves, contrary to natural justice and the gospel of Christ; and
   whereas, we believe the buying, selling, or holding of a human being as
   property, is a sin against God, and should in no wise be tolerated in
   the church of Christ: therefore,

   "We, the undersigned, members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the
   charge, Genesee Conference, would earnestly petition your reverend body
   to place a chapter in the Discipline of the M. E. Church, that will
   exclude all persons from the M. E. Church or her communion, who shall
   be guilty of holding, buying, or selling, or in any way using a human
   being as a slave."

   With the new year, Mr. Roberts had commenced to publish a monthly
   magazine, called the Earnest Christian, which called forth the
   following resolution, which was adopted by the convention:

   "Resolved, That we are highly pleased with the appearance of the
   Earnest Christian. The articles, thus far, prove it to be just what is
   needed at this time, when a conforming and superficial Christianity is
   prevailing everywhere. We hail it with delight among us; and we pledge
   ourselves to use our exertions to extend its circulation."

   The committee on resolutions reported as follows:

   "God deals with us as individuals. No man or body of men can take the
   responsibility of our actions. It is a Bible doctrine, very clearly
   taught, that "every one must give account of himself to God."

   "Ministers cannot take into their hands the keeping of our consciences.
   The right of private judgment lies at the foundation of the great
   Protestant Reformation. It forms the basis of all true religion. No
   person who does not act and think for himself can enjoy either the
   sanctifying or justifying grace of God. When John Wesley was told that
   he could not continue in the Church of England, because he could not in
   principle submit to her determinations," he replied: "If that were
   necessary, I could not be a member of any church under heaven; for I
   must still insist upon the right of private judgment. I cannot yield
   either implicit faith or obedience to any man or number of men under
   heaven."

   "This is equally true of every honest man. In our church, the
   government is vested exclusively in the ministry; the bishops
   appointing the preachers to whatever charge they please, and thus
   having the power to influence them to a great extent, if not absolutely
   to control them, by the hope of obtaining preferment, if they are
   submissive, and the fear of being placed in an obscure position if they
   do not carry out the will of their superiors. They are elected by the
   ministers, and are responsible alone to the men who are thus completely
   dependent upon them for their position in the church. The General
   Conference, possessing all the power to make laws for the churches, is
   composed exclusively of ministers, elected by ministers. The annual
   conference, which says who shall preach and who shall not, is made up
   of ministers. The book agents, wielding a mighty pecuniary influence,
   are ministers. The official editors, controlling the public sentiment
   of the church, are ministers. The same principle is carried out in the
   administration upon our circuits and stations. The preacher sent on --
   it may be in opposition to the wishes of a large majority of the
   members -- appoints all the leaders, nominates the stewards, and
   licenses the exhorters. If he wishes to expel a member, he selects the
   committee, and presides over the trial as judge. He goes out with them,
   and sees that they make up their verdict as he desires.

   "The only check to this immense clerical power -- without a parallel,
   unless it is in the Church of Rome -- consists in the right of the
   laity to refuse to support those ministers who abuse their trust, and
   show themselves unworthy of confidence. This only remedy in our power
   against clerical oppression we have felt bound to apply.

   "The course of those members of the Genesee Conference, known as the
   "Regency party, in screening one another when lying under the
   imputation of gross and flagrant immoralities; and in expelling from
   the conference and the church devoted ministers of the gospel, whose
   only crime consisted in the ability and success with which they taught
   and enforced the doctrine of holiness, and the fidelity with which they
   labored to secure the exclusion of slave holders from the church --
   this course, so contrary to the spirit of the gospel, as honest men
   going to judgment, we felt called upon to discountenance. We dare not
   give these ministers God speed in their bloody work, lest we be
   partakers in their evil deeds. We accordingly voted, in our
   conventions, that we could not sustain these preachers who were putting
   down the work of God.

   "These efforts of ours to correct great evils have been met by
   persecutions worthy of the priests of Rome in her darkest days. Men of
   approved piety, of long standing, whose prayers and efforts and money
   have been freely given to promote the interests of the church, have
   been expelled from the communion of their choice for having dared to
   act according to their convictions. Therefore,

   "Resolved, 1. That we heartily endorse the sentiments contained in the
   preambles and resolutions passed at the Albion conventions (December,
   1858 and November, 1859). The position then taken we this day
   unhesitatingly affirm, in our estimation, to be right. Convinced more
   than ever, that we need to act as one body in this matter, we hereby
   pledge ourselves unflinchingly and uncompromisingly to stand by the
   principles then laid down; and to sustain by our sympathy and our aid
   our brethren in the ministry who have been the subjects of a heartless
   and wicked proscription.

   "Resolved, 2. That we heartily condemn the practice pursued by many of
   the Regency preachers, in reading out members as withdrawn from the
   church without even the form of a trial, or without laboring with them.
   We deem it an act of outrage upon our rights as members of the church,
   contrary to the Discipline, and in direct opposition to the Spirit of
   Christ. We truly extend to our brethren and sisters who have thus been
   illegally read out from our beloved Zion, the right hand of fellowship.
   We rejoice that the Lamb's Book of Life is beyond the reach of human
   hands. And while they continue faithful followers of Jesus, whether in
   or out of the church, we hail them as members of the body of Christ."

   The report of the committee, after remarks made by several persons, all
   on the affirmative, was unanimously adopted. The following resolution,
   concerning the adherence to the M. E. Church, was also adopted:

   "Resolved, That we reiterate our unfaltering attachment to the
   Methodist Episcopal Church; while we protest against and repudiate its
   abuses and iniquitous administration, by which we have been aggrieved
   and the church scandalized. Our controversy is in favor of the
   doctrines and discipline of the church, and against temporary
   mal-administration. And we exhort our brethren everywhere not to
   secede, or withdraw from the church, or be persuaded into any other
   ecclesiastical organization; but to form themselves into bands, after
   the example of early Methodism, and remain in the church until
   expelled."

   On this resolution the following remarks were made:

   Rev. J. McCreery said: -- "Four years ago when we commenced this war,
   we sought to bring back Methodism to its pristine purity, and throw out
   these innovations which had crept in. We can spare all the preachers if
   the Lord and the people will be with us. We intend to stick to the
   church. We are where we stood years ago, and intend to stay there. We
   must stand on the Discipline, which is the constitution of the church.
   We are not secessionists, and they cannot drive us out, unless they
   expel us. We purpose to stay in the church. I am in favor of that
   resolution."

   T. B. Catton said -"We can organize bands and still be in the church,
   as it is in the Discipline. I am opposed to secession always. We have
   organized bands in Wyoming, and have met with good success, for the
   Lord has been with us."

   William Hart contended that the constitution of the church
   discountenanced slavery. He argued that the Discipline granted every
   member a fair trial. But all those who had been expelled had been
   denied that privilege. We have no need to secede, but to keep right on
   for God, and not be persuaded into any other ecclesiastical
   organization. Four were read out in my section on mere suspicion. He
   was in favor of the resolution.

   B. T. Roberts contended that bands were no new things, but were being
   organized all over the country, and in Europe, for the salvation of
   souls; and said that Orville Gardner was the leader of one in New York.
   He hoped these bands would be organized everywhere. If the ministers
   will help, all right; if not, go right on without them.

   S. K. J. Chesbro said, that the bands in his place had been prosperous,
   and many had been converted. He gave a history of their organization,
   which started with only ten members, but now it had thirty. He was
   strongly in favor of bands, and urged the brethren to do likewise.

   J. McCreery did not want to follow the plan of Orville Gardner's band,
   but the plan contained in the Methodist Discipline. The resolution
   defines itself. The members of the band in this section had not yet
   been turned out, and the authorities will not dare to do it.

   J. W. Reddy said, that the Regency preachers held the opinion that
   these bands were unconstitutional; but he denied it, and argued that we
   have as good a right to do so as they have to join the OddFellows or
   Masons. He believed in standing by the church, but contended for the
   right of religious liberty. He hoped the brethren would go to work with
   energy and organize these bands.

   These are characteristic remarks, and show the temper of the
   convention. The resolution was unanimously adopted.

   Several other resolutions, were adopted, committees, etc., were
   appointed, and the convention adjourned sine die.

   Mr. Redfield was watching these proceedings from St. Louis with deep
   interest. His letters and his labors in the West, including the
   proscription used by the church authorities there, show that the work
   East and West was one.

   The following letter will show another phase that was beginning to be
   manifested, and was destined to become a prominent feature of
   evangelistic work. It will also show a philosophical vein in his
   thinking upon a subject that gets but little attention.

   "ST. Louis, Feb. 1, 1860.

   "My very dear Sister Roberts: -- Your very interesting letter came to
   hand last night. I most deeply sympathize with you in your trying
   circumstances, and feel refreshed by the recital of your daring to obey
   God when I am so full of haltings in view of public opinion. I have
   long seen that our church must come to the exact state we now occupy,
   and that some one must take the stand and meet the conflict. I have
   shrunk and run from all responsibility I could, and yet preserve
   anything like peace with God. But I see God has thrust you out into the
   front rank, and I feel deeply ashamed that I have been so tardy in my
   labors for the cause of Jesus. Could I see you I could open my mind
   freely, and tell you my views relating to the matters of which you
   inquire.

   "I will say, however, I am more than ever convinced that God is about
   to perform a work in this land which is to tell in the salvation of
   myriads, and to stimulate sister churches to a higher tone of religion.
   And I am equally sure that God will open this era by means and
   instrumentalities quite out of the old stereotyped forms. Among these
   instrumentalities I believe woman is to take a very prominent part. But
   aside from all theorizing, I shall ask but two questions: d) Does God
   bless them? (2) Are souls converted and sanctified under their labors?
   If these questions are answered in the affirmative, no man can say nay.

   "As to the polish of rhetoric and philosophy to embellish the cross of
   Jesus, we have enough of it. As to great learning, to give the pedigree
   of Christianity and to illumine the dark sayings of the fathers in
   theology, we have it in abundance. But the world is not saved. Science,
   metaphysics, eloquence, and divinity have marched in solemn grandeur
   over Christendom, and yet the world is not saved. What we want, what we
   must have, is a type of religion that will bring God back to the world;
   that is, God in the moral phase of his character. And how can this be
   done except through the emotions of mankind? Men are bound too much by
   conventional rules, and strive to recommend the moral nature of God by
   his mental qualities or physical powers. We need to have manifested the
   love, justice, and purity of God, and this in the out-gushings of a
   heart that dares to be moved as God moves it. Man fears to betray such
   "weakness." Women are more willing to let God bless them, and this
   seems to be their calling.

   "Had any one told me six months before I came to St. Louis that
   ministers in the Methodist Episcopal Church (North) would abet the vile
   system of slavery, and not only that, but oppose the doctrines of
   Methodism, I should have regarded it as a slander. But I am compelled
   to own the humiliating fact, and that if some one is not raised up to
   reestablish the broken foundations of Methodism, she has run her race,
   and must soon be reckoned among the things that were. But whoever
   undertakes the task must tasks the consequences of his effort.

   "J. W. Redfield."

CHAPTER 63

   The venerable Elias Bowen, D.D., in his history of the Origin of the
   Free Methodist Church, says:

   "The General Conference -- upon which so many anxious eyes were turned,
   on account of the Genesee difficulties, in the hope that all there
   would be made right -- commenced its session May 1st, 1860, in the city
   of Buffalo, and continued its deliberations during the entire month. It
   was soon apparent, however, that the spirit of early Methodism had
   departed from that venerable body, and another spirit than that of the
   fathers -- the spirit of a worldly, ambitious, temporizing policy --
   ruled the hour. The delegates belonging to secret societies, and those
   of a proslavery type, making common cause of it, refused by a majority
   vote which they contrived to command, to entertain Mr. Roberts' appeal,
   though in barefaced opposition to one of our strictest rules; and, of
   course, this ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ, in accordance with
   the action of the Genesee Conference in his case, stood expelled from
   the church."

   Rev. William Hosmer, editor of the Northern Independent, in that paper,
   said:

   "Methodism has taught us to live in the presence of God, and to shape
   all our acts under the inspection of his eye. Whatsoever cannot abide
   this test, must be discarded and abhorred, because it will surely be
   condemned in the eternal judgment' to which we are hastening. That the
   Court of Appeals, constituted by the last General Conference, did not
   do its work so as to secure either divine or human respect, is a
   conclusion forced upon us from every view we have been able to take of
   the subject. Gladly would we pass by these judicial proceedings without
   further notice if it were allowable. But they are of too serious a
   character, and will be found too far-reaching in their consequences, to
   admit of silent acquiescence. Ecclesiastical courts are not famous for
   liberality and justice; but we believe the courts of Methodism have not
   generally sunk to the level indicated by the trial of these appeals.

   "First in order was the case of Rev. C. D. Burlingham. He was expelled
   from the Genesee Conference and the Methodist Episcopal Church for
   doing three things:

   "1st. Admitting B. T. Roberts into the church on trial.

   "2nd. Licensing him to exhort.

   "3rd. Officiating with expelled preachers at a general quarterly
   meeting held in a Wesleyan church, at the same time that his presiding
   elder was holding a regular quarterly meeting in the same charge, about
   three miles distant.

   "Mr. Burlingham admitted the facts, but pleaded in justification:

   "1st. That he received B. T. Roberts, and licensed him to exhort, on
   the unanimous recommendation of the society meeting of the church with
   which Mr. Roberts had last labored. In this action he believed he was
   covered by Bishop Baker, who says, in his work on the Discipline, page
   159, "If, however, the society become convinced of the innocence of the
   expelled member, he may again be received on trial, without
   confession."

   "2nd. That when engaged to attend the general quarterly meeting, he
   supposed that Mr. Roberts had a right as an exhorter to hold meetings.

   "3rd. That he did not know that the Methodist Episcopal Church had a
   society, or an appointment in the place where the general quarterly
   meeting was held. He supposed the ground was occupied exclusively by
   the Wesleyans.

   "These were the only offenses with which Mr. Burlingham was charged.

   "After his expulsion he waited patiently for the General Conference. He
   did not preach, nor lecture, nor exhorted -- did not attend meetings
   held by expelled preacher -- but did not penance up to the session of
   the General Conference. He should have been restored on the ground of
   having expiated his guilt, if he was guilty of any ordinary offense. if
   on no other. When his appeal came up, Mr. Fuller, [10] who had been
   chief prosecutor in all those trials, challenged several of the
   committee who had manifested a desire to have Genesee Conference
   matters fairly investigated. Though the General Conference, in
   constituting the committee, or Court of Appeals, had given to parties
   the right to challenge for cause, yet Mr. Fuller, after the first
   instance, was not required to give cause, but challenged as many as he
   chose, and they were set aside. He simply said of the challenged, "he
   considered them prejudiced."

   "Mr. Olin, of the Oneida Conference, managed the case for Mr.
   Burlingham with consummate tact and great ability. His plea was a
   masterly effort, and carried conviction to the minds, we believe, of
   all who heard it, except the committee. They sent the case back to the
   conference for a new trial. This we regard as a remarkable decision.
   Neither party asked for it. We never heard before of a case being
   remanded for a new trial, unless there was some alleged informality in
   the court below, or defect in the record, or unless one or the other of
   the parties claimed to have new testimony which could not be introduced
   into the first trial. But nothing of the kind was intimated in this
   case. There can be no new testimony, for Mr. Burlingham admitted all
   the facts with which he was charged.

   "Do these facts, mentioned above, constitute a crime, for which an able
   minister, of spotless reputation, who has served the church for over
   twenty years, devoting the vigor of his manhood's prime in
   self-sacrificing efforts to promote her interests, should be expelled?
   Then let the General Conference say so, that all who henceforth enter
   the Methodist ministry may understand that they are expected to lay
   their manhood in the dust, part with the right of private judgment, and
   yield a servile, unquestioning obedience to all behests of their
   ecclesiastical superiors.

   "Was Mr. Burlingham, through party malignity, treated unjustly? Was he
   wrongfully deposed from the ministry, and excluded from the church?
   Then the General Conference should have restored him. This was due to
   him; it was due to outraged justice; it was due to the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, whose Discipline -- confessedly more susceptible of
   abuse than any other church in this country has been used for the
   purpose of inflicting ecclesiastical oppression without a parallel in
   the nineteenth century.

   "But the General Conference, through its committee, or Court of
   Appeals, after gravely listening to the testimony and pleadings, sent
   the case back for a new trial, without a motion to that effect from
   either party. What, we ask, is there to try? There can be no issue on
   the facts -- these are admitted.

   "But Mr. Burlingham contends that these facts do not constitute a crime
   for which he should be deposed from the church.

   "The Genesee Conference has said they do. Here is the issue -- who
   shall decide? The Discipline vests the power in the General Conference
   -- the body to try appeals. The case was properly brought before them;
   they have sent it back for the Genesee Conference to decide over again.
   What an absurd decision! What an insult to Mr. Burlingham, and to
   common sense! Suppose the views of law and justice entertained by the
   Genesee Conference remain unchanged, and the same sentence be again
   pronounced against Mr. Burlingham, and he again appeals. After waiting
   four years for another General Conference, if he still survive, there
   will not only be the same reason for sending the case back for a new
   trial as now, but the additional one of precedent. Thus, this mockery
   of justice may continue ad infinitum.

   "This looks more like the tiger playing with the victim he intends to
   devour, than like a body of Christian ministers bound by every
   consideration that can influence to right action, to judge righteous
   judgment.

   "Another fact is worthy of especial notice. Though the decision in the
   case was not asked for in court by either party, yet it is precisely
   what partisans of the Regency party of the Genesee Conference have been
   endeavoring for months to persuade Mr. Burlingham to consent to. These
   efforts were continued up to the morning of the day on which the appeal
   was heard. Yet neither in their pleadings, nor at any time while the
   appeal was being heard, did the counsel for the conference signify
   their wish that the case might be remanded for a new trial. At whose
   suggestion was it done? When was the suggestion made? Was there any
   collusion in the matter? It is impossible for us to answer these
   questions. View it in whatever light you may, the whole case has a dark
   and suspicious aspect.

   "Perhaps some clue to an explanation of the strange proceedings in
   relation to the Genesee Conference appeal cases may be found in the
   action had upon the slavery question.

   "The Genesee Conference has heretofore been one of the strongest
   antislavery conferences in the connection. The proscribed party have
   been from the first uncompromising in their hostility to slavery in the
   church and in the state.

   "The Genesee delegates were once regarded as antislavery; what they are
   now their votes will show. We asserted last fall that the conference
   had become proslavery, and gave as proof the fact that while it
   condemned this paper, it refused to take any action against slavery.
   The truth of our inference was denied by some; but the recent course of
   their delegates has made our words good. When the important question
   was decided in the General Conference upon a change of the
   constitution, so as to prohibit slave-holding in the church, the
   delegates of the Genesee conference voted against a change, and their
   vote turned the scale. And when the Genesee Conference matters came up,
   the border proslavery delegates voted solid with the representatives of
   the majority of the Genesee Conference. This may be all fair. It may be
   that men who, four years ago, took the stump to keep slavery out of the
   territories, have suddenly become convinced that it should be nestled
   and fostered in the bosom of the church! We should like to know by what
   arguments they were converted, and when it was done! Was this a part of
   a scheme to keep slaveholders in the church? Did the border delegates
   understand that if they voted as desired by the Genesee delegates, they
   would reciprocate the favor and assist them in their extremity? Or did
   this strange coincidence come about by chance?" [11]

   There were exciting scenes in the West about this time. In March, of
   this same year, after a three-months' continuous meeting in St.
   Charles, the writer went to visit those converted the fall before. On
   arriving at the place he learned that the church trustees, by a
   majority vote, had adopted a resolution that neither Mr. Redfield nor
   himself should preach in the church again. Some of these men were also
   school trustees, and they had adopted a similar resolution as to
   preaching in the schoolhouse.

   But few knew of this action of the trustees until we met in church the
   next morning. A large number of the young converts came together in the
   afternoon, at a private house, for prayer and testimony.

   While we were singing the hymn,

   "Jesus, lover of my soul,"

   the power of God came upon us in a wonderful manner. But so great and
   so intense was the opposition here where we had formerly experienced
   such a signal victory that our enemies went from this meeting and
   reported that Mr. T_____ had the young converts get on their knees and
   swear that they would follow Mr. Redfield and himself.

   At the close of the meeting the writer was asked when he would preach
   to them; and it was then that it became known that the trustees both of
   the church and schoolhouse had taken the action already referred to. J.
   W. Dake, now a Free Methodist preacher in Iowa (1888), and who was
   present, said, "I know of a schoolhouse where he can preach"; and
   agreement was made to have service in the one alluded to about two
   miles distant on Monday evening. This was announced at the church that
   evening in a private way. The next evening a large congregation
   gathered, and the power of the Lord was present to heal. Indications of
   a revival were so strong that we could not hold back from announcing a
   service for the next night. This was the occasion of the setting in of
   a severe persecution. Young people were forbidden to attend the
   meetings. Falsehood and slander began to do their best. The timid were
   frightened from their steadfastness, and the brave rapidly developed as
   soldiers for Jesus.

   The second Sunday morning, the pastor of the church, instead of the
   usual Scripture lesson, read a long original paper, in which he accused
   the writer of being in league with Mr. Redfield to divide the church;
   and concluded with the proposition that, if he would confess the wrong,
   and promise to do so no more, they (the church at Mt. Pleasant) would
   take him to their hearts and to the church. Three weeks later he handed
   in his church letter, and was immediately given a regular appointment
   to preach in that church.

   The meeting in the Union schoolhouse, as it was called, lasted but a
   fortnight, but quite a number were converted, some of whom became noted
   for piety and triumphant death.

   At the close of this meeting the writer visited Marengo, in McHenry
   county, the scene of one of Mr. Redfield's greatest victories. Here it
   was learned that the Bishop family, in whose country home the noted
   Monday-night holiness meeting had been held so long, were now cited to
   trial on a charge of disobedience to the order and Discipline of the
   church. The first specification was, non-attendance of public worship
   in the church where they belonged. The second was, non-attendance of
   class.

   The facts were they had spent the most of the winter in a revival in a
   country schoolhouse, six miles from home -- at great inconvenience to
   themselves -- where more than forty persons had been converted. What
   had made it more easy for them to do this was the fact that they could
   neither attend preaching or class meeting without being made a target
   for sharp speeches, both by the pastor and the members of the church.
   It was also a fact that there were members of the church who not only
   did not attend worship, but they did not profess to be Christians at
   all. And more, there were more than one-half of the membership who
   never attended class. It was evident from these facts that the trial
   was persecution, and not a sincere attempt to bring the church to
   discipline. The family of five -- father, mother, two sons, and a
   daughter -- were all expelled. In his hot haste the pastor had
   forgotten that he had given a letter to the oldest son who was a
   Garrett Biblical Institute student.

   A large company had gathered, as witnesses for the accused, many of
   them the fruits of the revival described, while some, like the writer,
   had come from sympathy. The minister at first ordered us all out of the
   church, but as it was a severe March day, this was impracticable, and
   while we were deliberating what to do, he adjourned the trial to his
   dwelling, and left us in peaceable possession of the church. An
   impromptu love-feast was inaugurated, and for several hours the time
   was fully occupied. During this time there was but one allusion to the
   trouble, save that, it was forgotten in the enjoyment of the hour.

   Sunday the writer visited the young converts at the Brick schoolhouse,
   where the Bishop family had spent their winter, and found them giants
   in experience. Many of them were heads of families.

   Monday evening there was a great gathering at Father Bishop's for the
   holiness meeting. Father Coleman was present, and led the meeting. His
   was the only allusion to the trouble. He said, "Don't pound your
   troubles; if you do, they'll pound you, and you will get the worst of
   it. If they turn me out of the fold, I'll go bleating around until they
   take me back in again?"

   The General Conference came and went, but there was no redress of the
   grievances complained of. Mr. Roberts' case was left as the Genesee
   Conference left it. Nearly every law-point, under which these wrongs
   had been perpetrated, was decided against the presiding bishops.

   The conference declared that the interpretations of law by a bishop in
   the interim of conference did not have the force of law; that is, they
   were authoritative only when the bishop was presiding in a judicial
   capacity. This was aimed at Bishop Simpson's interpretation of the law,
   that with the consent of the official board a preacher might declare a
   member withdrawn who did not attend the service of his own church. On
   this opinion, many had been excluded from the church in that summary
   way. But though it is, and was, a maxim of Methodism, that a member
   shall not suffer from the mal-administration of a preacher in charge,
   there was not a single instance, so far as is known, where there was an
   attempt to reinstate a member who had thus been excluded.

   In view of taking such action as might be necessary after the General
   Conference, a Laymen's Convention had been called to meet July 1, 1860,
   in connection with a camp meeting to be held on the grounds of J. M.
   Laughlin, near St. Charles, Illinois. A similar convention had been
   called in Western New York. The object of both was the same.

   Mr. Redfield had charge of the religious services at St. Charles,
   assisted by Revs. B. T. Roberts, Seymour Coleman, G. H. Fox, and E. P.
   Hart, besides a large number of local preachers from various parts of
   the Northwest. St. Louis, Mo., Southern Iowa, and Wisconsin, and
   Marengo, Woodstock, Queen Anne, Garden Prairie, Brick Schoolhouse,
   Elgin, Coral, Clintonville, Geneva, Aurora, Wheaton, and Mt. Pleasant,
   within the state of Illinois, were represented by laymen. The camp
   meeting was one of great power. God was there, and many were saved.

   The following are the minutes of the Laymen's Convention:

   "After devotional exercises, B. T. Roberts was chosen president, and C.
   E. McCollister, secretary.

   "Members of the convention:

   "St. Louis: -- Richard Thornton, local elder; Daniel Lloyd, Ad. C.
   Coughlin, Charles R. Townsend (local preacher) J. W. Redfield (local
   preacher), C. E. McCollister, L. E. Benedict.

   "St. Charles: -- Elisha Foote, Warren Tyler, John Laughlin.

   "Clintonville: -- Joseph Corron, Benjamin Peaslee, C. E. Harroun (local
   preacher).

   "Coral: -- J. M. White.

   "Union: -- Joseph Deitz, L. H. Bishop, Wm. D. Bishop (local preacher),
   I. H. Fairchild (local deacon).

   "Woodstock -- S. Wilson, Warren Stanard, William Wright, M. Best.

   "Queen Anne: -- G. N. Fairchild.

   "Mt. Pleasant: -- Melville Beach, J. W. Dake, U. C. Rowe, J. G. Terrill
   (local preacher).

   "A camp meeting was ordered to be held at Coral, McHenry county, Ill.,
   commencing September 5, and holding one week.

   "It was also ordered to hold another on the same grounds about the same
   time next year.

   "President Roberts wrote and presented the following resolution, which
   was unanimously adopted:

   "Resolved, That our attachment to the doctrines, usages, spirit, and
   discipline of Methodism, is hearty and sincere. It is with the most
   profound grief that we have witnessed the departure of many of the
   ministers from the God-honored usages of Methodism. We feel bound to
   adhere to them, and to labor all we can, and to the best possible
   advantage, to promote the life and power of godliness. We recommend
   that those in sympathy with the doctrine of holiness, as taught by
   Wesley, should labor in harmony with the respective churches to which
   they belong. But when this cannot be done, without continual strife and
   contention, we recommend the formation of Free Methodist churches, as
   contemplated by the convention held in the Genesee Conference, in New
   York."

   "I. H. Fairchild was recommended to take work in the itineracy of the
   convention.

   "U. C. Rowe was licensed to preach.

   "C. E. McCollister was appointed to missionary work in Michigan.

   "A committee of five was appointed as a standing stationing committee,
   consisting of three ministers and two laymen, to hold their position
   until the next convention. I. H. Fairchild, C. E. Harroun, J. W.
   Redfield, E. Foote, and O. Joslyn, were made said committee.

   "J. W. Redfield's character was passed, and he was appointed
   superintendent of the Western work.

   "President Roberts and J. W. Redfield were requested to appoint a
   preacher for St. Louis.

   "The committee on stationing preachers was instructed to employ all
   local preachers under their charge.

   "A motion was passed to recognize the ordinations of those ministers
   who have come among us.

   "A. B. Burdick, a local preacher of St. Louis, was made a member of the
   convention.

   "B. T. Roberts was unanimously elected general superintendent of the
   work.

   "The stationing committee made the following appointments:

   The broken style of these minutes indicate that these men were new to
   the work of such assemblies, and that their action was unpremeditated.
   The General Conference was just over. In almost all of these places to
   which ministers were appointed there were members of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church who had either been read out, or expelled, or were
   suffering from some form of proscription. Some of these local preachers
   were still members of that church.

   In the month of August a general convention was held in Pekin, N. Y.,
   in connection with a. camp meeting. Isaac M. Chesbrough, of Pekin, was
   chairman, and A. A. Phelps secretary. This was a delegated body, and
   was composed of sixty members -- fifteen preachers, and forty-five
   laymen. The deliberations of the convention resulted in the
   organization of the Free Methodist Church, and the formation of their
   Discipline.

   In September a convention was held on a campground at Aurora, Illinois,
   by which the new Discipline was adopted. The preachers who had taken
   work in June now went forth to organize Free Methodist churches
   wherever opportunity could be found.

   The writer has thought it best to give this history of the rise and
   organization of the Free Methodist Church, first, because Mr. Redfield
   was so closely identified with it; and, secondly, to vindicate his
   course. It seems clear that he could do no other way. Necessity was
   laid upon him, as it was also upon others who were identified with the
   movement.

CHAPTER 64

   After the Pekin Convention, Mr. Redfield returned to the West, and
   commenced his labors for the winter with great zeal and encouragement.
   He undertook the visitation of all the points where societies had
   already been organized, and where there was a desire to organize.

   Rev. B. P. Hart, about this time, withdrew from the Methodist Episcopal
   Church, and took work under Mr. Redfield; and an opening occurring in
   Belvidere, Illinois, he went there and labored with great success. A
   society had been organized in Aurora, Illinois. Calls were coming from
   every direction, and about twenty laborers were already in the field.
   Mr. Redfield in his visits reached Aurora the first of November. He
   preached for the new society on Sunday, met the official board Monday
   night, and while sitting in the rooms of a friend, Tuesday morning, was
   suddenly smitten to the floor with paralysis. He was taken to the house
   of Rev. Judah Mead, a local preacher, where he lay for weeks in
   terrible physical and mental anguish. The latter arose from his
   inability to understand this peculiar providence. He knew he had
   overtaxed himself. He knew that the severe mental strain through which
   he had gone during the troubles in St. Louis, and his care and anxiety
   for the new organization, had induced this. But he had been of the
   opinion that, if one was honestly seeking the divine glory, and doing
   his best to advance the kingdom of God in the earth, that God would not
   allow him to fail. This notion now afforded the ground for severe
   mental conflicts. Again, his physical pain was such, and so intense was
   every sense of sight, of hearing, of smelling, of tasting, and feeling,
   and so excruciating was the pain inflicted by the simplest offenses to
   the organs of these senses, that it was almost unendurable. Then
   temptation would assault him in regard to his conduct during these
   seasons of distress, that he had behaved like anything but a Christian.

   Brother Osgood Joslyn, who had been converted under his ministry, was
   impressed while praying at home, that Mr. Redfield was in great
   trouble, and that he must go to his assistance. He immediately went to
   Aurora, and found him in the condition described above. From this time
   for three years this brother, with all the fidelity and sympathy of a
   son for a father, nursed, and traveled with, and cared for, this
   afflicted man of God, until he saw his remains laid away in the tomb.

   As spring approached, Mr. Redfield was so much better that he was
   removed from Aurora, and finally became able to travel quite
   extensively. He visited the East, and held meetings a few weeks in
   Buffalo, in the Free Methodist Church. From there he wrote the
   following letter to Samuel Huntington, of Burlington, Vt., which
   describes his health, his feelings, and, to some extent, his financial
   circumstances:

   "Buffalo, N. Y., April 17, 1861.

   "Dear Brother Huntington: -- Your letter, dated the 12th, was received
   last evening. My health is gradually improving. I can walk about the
   house a little by using a cane, but I still have to be lifted in and
   out of a carriage. We are now holding meetings in the Second Free
   Methodist church, in this city. I have been able to preach three or
   four times a week. At the rate I am improving, I hope to be able to get
   in and out of a carriage during the summer.

   "I wish you could see it in your way to come to our camp meeting at St.
   Charles, Illinois, on the 12th of June. We shall probably have a good
   representation at that time. If you have the time to spare, you could
   go by the way of the lakes, from Buffalo to Chicago, for from six to
   nine dollars. From Chicago to the camp ground, by rail, it is only
   about thirty miles.

   "I would like to have you get acquainted with our Western pilgrims. A
   more noble, wholehearted and red-hot set of pilgrims you never saw. The
   work of salvation in the West is spreading rapidly. So large is the
   demand that we can hardly find men enough to man the walls of our Zion.

   "I hope you will not permit the true interests of the cause to suffer
   for want of independence in yourself, even to stand alone if need be.
   If the conference does not send you the right kind of a man, "go it on
   your own hook," and if the worst comes, I think we could find a
   preacher among the Free Methodists that would suit you.

   "I hardly know what to say about Dr. W_____'s proposal. I fear I cannot
   make an offer that will seem to him perfectly right. I took this view
   of the matter: first, that I am in need of what he owes me; second, I
   cannot think it wrong for me to ask him to return to me what he is
   unable to pay for. Yet if I felt able to lose it, I would say nothing.
   But in thinking the matter over, I do not see what he will be able to
   do for a library and medicines if I take mine back.

   "If he can pay ten dollars a month, and not fail, I will try and get
   along with that. But I would like to have things so secure that no one
   else can take them away from him.

   "If he does not wish to do this I will take the books, if in as good
   order as when I let him have them, at the same price I charged him; and
   the same with the medicine chest.

   "I do not want him to think that I would distress him.

   "Love to Dr. W_____ and all good pilgrims.

   "Yours affectionately,

   "J. W. Redfield."

   He returned to Illinois, and the last of May came to Ogle Station, now
   Ashton, near Mt. Pleasant, to attend a quarterly meeting on my new
   circuit. This had been organized in part out of the fruits of the great
   revival at Mt. Pleasant which has already been described.

   On Sunday morning he preached from the text, "It is finished." His wife
   was obliged to sit by his side, and prop him up by holding her hands
   under his left elbow, while he held on to the pulpit with his right
   hand. During the opening prayer, he seemed to talk face to face with
   God. I was impressed with the thought, we shall see wondrous things
   today. While attempting to read the second hymn his emotions overcame
   him, and he requested us to sing without further reading.

   The outline of his sermon was somewhat as follows:
    1. Man's condition before the fall.
    2. His condition after the fall.
    3. None among men or angels who are qualified to redeem him.
    4. The finding of "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
    5. Man redeemed.

   After the first few introductory remarks, probably not one-half dozen
   of the large congregation had a thought outside of the theme of the
   sermon. One could read the separate divisions of the discourse upon the
   countenances of his listeners. While portraying in the most graphic
   manner, his conception of man's physical, mental and spiritual state
   before the fall, every face seemed beaming with admiration. When he
   introduced the Tempter amid this scene of loveliness, consternation
   seemed to take the place; and when at last the sin was finished, and
   all the dire results were ushered in, an expression of indignation
   spread over every face. When he portrayed the disabilities of sin, and
   the helplessness of humanity, Christians, for the time, forgot they
   were Christians, and both they and sinners simultaneously wailed out
   their anguish, and every face took on a look of fearful despair. When
   he at last found a ransom in the person of the Son of God, and, in a
   few sentences, made plain the reasonableness of the atonement of
   Christ, sinners forgot they were sinners and joined in the rejoicings
   of the saints. Before he was through with his last point, the benefits
   of redemption, more than twenty persons were on their feet, with eyes
   closed, clasped hands, and streaming faces, gazing by faith upon the
   wonderful provisions of grace. For some moments I expected to see a
   group of very wicked men back by the door on their feet, uniting in
   this demonstration of joy.

   Several times, I now recollect, I was lost with the rest. But at this
   point there came to my mind, with great dearness and power, William
   Wirt's story of "The Blind Preacher," which I had read in my boyhood.
   Mr. Wirt, after describing the man, the circumstances, the occasion,
   and the wonderful eloquence of the preacher, and its effect upon his
   congregation, spoke of his fears, that when the congregation came to
   realize where they were, and what they were, that the mental shock
   would destroy the good effect of the discourse. And I now found myself
   wondering in like manner. But while I wondered, Mr. Redfield began to
   let them down so gradually and perfectly that the good effects were
   saved. He said:

   "When the great Erie Canal was completed, a line of cannon was
   stationed along its banks its entire length. When the water was let in
   at Buffalo, cannon number one was fired, and cannon number two took up
   the report, and passed it on to number three, and number three to
   number four, and so on, until the report reached Albany; and whoever
   heard the report of the cannon understood it to mean, it is finished.
   And so when God had prepared the way and let in the tide of salvation
   on which man was to come back to his Maker, the first report was heard
   in the song of the angels "Glory to God in the highest; on earth peace,
   good will to men"; and the last dying echoes of it came from the cross
   in the words of the text, "It is finished."

   He then let go of the desk and allowed himself to fall back upon the
   pulpit sofa.

   The next day the writer accompanied him and his wife to St. Charles,
   and in a few days to a general quarterly meeting at Crystal Lake, and
   the next week to Belvidere, and at last to the camp meeting at St.
   Charles. At all these places we had meetings of great power and
   success.

   The St. Charles camp meeting was largely attended. It was led by
   Superintendent Roberts. Mr. Redfield did not attempt to preach but
   once, and that was spoiled by a fanatical Congregationalist who was
   determined to have him healed on the spot.

   Soon after this Mr. Redfield began to entertain hopes that God would
   restore him. His knowledge of his case, as a physician, gave him no
   hope from the arts or skill of men. He knew none but God could do the
   work. His mental conflicts were most severe. He saw so much to do, so
   few to do it, and himself willing to do his best, and he wondered why
   God did not set him free. For twenty-six years he had longed for the
   time to come when he could work untrammeled. Now the time had come, and
   he was mysteriously laid by. He would ask the feeblest saints to
   account for it, and would listen to them with the profoundest
   attention. It was pitiful at times to see him, when some unwise
   believer would publicly condemn him with the philosophy that if he was
   right he would not be thus afflicted. At such times he would receive
   their idle vaporings as the most solemn truth, because it coincided
   with his oppressive temptations on the subject. At times he would rise
   above it all, and would triumph gloriously.

   He visited the quarterly and camp meetings, gave advice, counseled with
   the young preachers, and did what he could in the public services. He
   sometimes tried to preach, but his thinking powers seemed paralyzed;
   and at last he gave up trying altogether.

   The following letter will show his state of mind at this time. Some of
   it evidently tokens the breaking down of his magnificent mind.

   "Marengo, Ill., Feb. 10, 1862.

   "My dear Sister Roberts: -- I have felt drawn to write to you and have
   begun and then abandoned it for the time, and thought it best to wait
   till I had something of more importance to write. I have been learning
   lessons through my whole affliction that nothing but this very severe
   stroke could teach me. Astronomers, who wish to gaze at the heavens in
   daylight, go into deep wells, and from those dark places can see what
   they cannot see above ground. I, too, have been making this dark valley
   my observatory for about fifteen months, and some of the views I have
   had, and still have, are not lawful to describe. I see a deep meaning
   in my case that must have a bearing upon the cause of Free Methodism,
   all over the land. I had been learning fact after fact till a few weeks
   ago in St. Charles, when I saw the wonderful cure of Sister M_____ from
   a state of disease which under the best of treatment must have taken
   weeks if not months, and yet it was done instantly. I saw great light,
   and was rejoicing in it, and my heart was deeply agitated, when I asked
   the Lord, "Why may I not also receive the healing touch?' I began a
   thorough search to find out where there might be any deficiency in my
   moral state, and the first thing I ran against was, my undue care and
   anxiety for the Free Methodist Church, and preachers. While I was
   giving up the church it seemed that it would almost take my life. After
   the church came the preachers, and I had to give them all up. I had not
   once suspected that it was wrong to love the dear boys, or to feel an
   interest in them; but I found that unsuspectingly I was assuming the
   place of the Lord, and I was regarding them above all other gospel
   ministers. I now learned that I must not value the Free Methodist
   Church or its preachers, above any other Universal charity was the
   lesson I was here taught. Next came the most gentle and sweet
   intimations that I must soon go to Syracuse. I gave way to reasoning
   about the propriety of this, when I was seized with strangling spasms,
   and it seemed I must yield to go or die. Four or five were present who
   were in a great struggle, of prayer for me. But as soon as I gave up to
   go, reason or no reason, I was instantly at perfect peace and rest. I
   had no idea that I would be made to suffer so intensely for simply a
   conscientious hesitancy about going until I felt clear that it was the
   voice of the Lord.

   "Today I had another down spell, little dreaming that anything was
   affecting me except the usual depression which affects me on account of
   my feeble condition; when the most mild and gentle influence turned my
   eye back to about ten years ago when God gave me a commission to preach
   redemption, [12] and the question came, "Will you go back to that?'
   When I said, "I will," I was all light again. I am now holding myself
   in readiness for marching orders. I may not be mustered out for some
   time to come; but I say, "Anytime and anywhere."

   "I have much to say that I cannot put on paper. I have learned much I
   never could have known had I not been afflicted.

   "I am now writing my life, and shall bring it with me, to see about
   getting it published.

   "My love to Brother Roberts.

   "J. W. Redfield."

   During this summer Mr. Redfield gathered together what means he had,
   and purchased forty acres of unimproved land near Geneva, the county
   seat of Kane county, and about three miles from St. Charles. A letter
   before me in which he ordered small fruits from a nurseryman, is a
   curiosity. When asked what he intended to do with his land, he divulged
   a plan to make it a pilgrims' home. His house and outbuildings would
   have cost many thousands of dollars. When asked where the income of the
   home was to come from, he did not know.

   In the fall of 1862 he attended a camp meeting in Ogle county,
   Illinois. Here an incident occurred that drew him out, and for a few
   moments he seemed himself again. At half-past ten o'clock Monday
   morning Mr. Roberts commenced a sacramental service. A table was spread
   with the bread and wine, in front of the desk; the love-feast had
   closed, and Mr. Roberts gave out the hymn commencing,

   "What! never speak one idle word?"

   when one of the preachers interrupted him with the question, "Is that
   hymn a just test of entire sanctification?"

   "It is," was the answer.

   "Then I have not got it," replied the questioner. "Nor I," "nor I,"
   said several. Immediately commenced a spirit of confession, of being
   without the experience, first on the part of many who had lost it; then
   others threw away their confidence as they listened to those
   confessions, until it resulted in a panic. Mr. Roberts was unable to
   preach because of it until ten o'clock at night. There was scarcely any
   partaking of food, and no cessation of the meeting during the day. The
   scene was indescribable. The gloom of despair seemed to settle upon
   almost all. About four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Redfield arose,
   and, after considerable effort, secured the attention of the despairing
   ones, and when all was quiet, he asked, in his inimitable manner, "Is
   there not a short way out of the woods?" and then proceeded to clear
   away the confusion of thought which prevailed. In a very short time,
   those who had unnecessarily cast away their confidence began to take it
   back, at first tremblingly, and at last joyously. Then those who had
   need to confess their backslidings and to seek for salvation, did so,
   and a glorious victory was the result.

   During the winter of 62 and 63, a visit was made to Buffalo, and then
   to Syracuse, where were pilgrims of mighty faith, and he hoped for
   restoration in answer to their prayers. Here he began to show evidences
   of the breaking down of his mind; which led many of his friends to
   distrust his personal convictions of duty. This caused him great pain.
   At last he turned his face toward the West again, weeping as he went.
   He said but little now in public gatherings. He attended the annual
   session of the Illinois Conference. The love-feast Sunday morning was
   truly blessed, and none enjoyed it more than Mr. Redfield. When the
   bread and water were passed, he tried several times to drink from the
   cup, such were his overflowing tears, and the convulsive joy of his
   heart. Little did some of us think that it was the last we should see
   him alive. He returned to the home of Brother Joslyn, who had so long
   cared for him. The last letter he ever wrote was the following. It
   shows the ruling spirit of his life. It was to a Wesleyan minister.

   "Marengo, Ill., Oct. 29, 1863.

   "Dear Brother F_____: -- Your kind favor of the 17th came duly to hand.
   We have often wondered why you left here so soon, and why you did not
   write. We see by your letter that the devil is neither dead nor
   converted, and that you are beginning to learn that to take sides with
   God is equivalent to a declaration of war against the world of
   formalism. But while we were sympathizing with you in your conflicts
   for God and truth, our hearts were made glad last week, at our
   conference, to see an old man, a postmaster, who had come about eighty
   miles to see the Free Methodists, and to learn the way of holiness. He
   said he saw a report in the American Wesleyan from a Brother F_____,
   giving an account of his experience, and now he wanted to know how to
   get what Brother F_____ had got. He began in good earnest, and soon was
   hopping and shouting in a glorious manner, and went to his home to show
   what great things the Lord had done for him.

   "I think if you could have seen him, you would have taken courage to
   stand for God and the truth. We will pray God to make you a power in
   the earth; and I think he will look to you to spread holiness in your
   church. God will stand by you. Shall the Almighty find in you one who
   dares to stand for the right? Some one must assert the rights of God,
   and stand in defense of the gospel. The mission is to you; will you
   honor the call, or let God's cause go by default? True, you will be
   often misunderstood, often slandered, and will pass a stormy life, and
   possibly die in obscurity. Your epitaph from mouth to mouth may be,
   "Poor, mistaken man;" he might have passed through the world like a
   comet, leaving a luminous path behind; but he disregarded the judgment
   and opinions of men, and died unhonored by the masses." Can you stand
   thus to be unappreciated, and even depreciated for God and truth's
   sake? Oh, take courage, brother. Don't make it necessary for God to
   scrape the truth in pronouncing on you, "Well done, good and faithful
   servant." The great battle has begun. God and the devil are in combat.
   War, war, is everywhere. The spirit land is in commotion. The world has
   caught the spirit conflict. Armageddon has sounded the war cry, and the
   closing struggle is upon us. As a sentinel for the truth you, yes you,
   Brother F_____, must stand. God has ratified your authority by your
   success, and he now demands, and will hold you responsible for,
   fidelity. God help you, is my prayer.

   "Yours in Jesus,

   "J. W. Redfield.

   The delay in answering the letter was caused by his attending the
   conference.

   November 1st, the next day after writing this letter, another stroke of
   paralysis came, and he was laid upon his bed in an apparently
   unconscious state. Friends watched over him with more than filial
   solicitude; but his eyes were darkened, and his eloquent lips were
   hushed. A few minutes before eight o'clock, November 2, 1863, his right
   leg drew up and straightened out again in the same manner in which he
   was accustomed to stamp at the turning point of his great spiritual
   battles.

   A hush came upon all in the room. The place seemed filled with the
   hosts of God, and John Wesley Redfield was at rest.

   Two days later his funeral was held in the Free Methodist church in
   Marengo, Illinois, conducted by his friend and beloved brother in the
   Lord, Rev. B. T. Roberts. Six young ministers, who loved him as their
   lives, bore him to his last resting place in the beautiful cemetery
   near by. Above his grave stands a small marble shaft, and inscribed
   upon it is this fitting tribute:

   "HE WAS TRUE To His Motto, -- Fidelity To GOD."

  THE CONQUEROR CROWNED.


   "Servant of God, well done!

   Thy glorious warfare's past;

   The battle's fought, the race is won

   And thou art crowned at last;--

   "Of all thy heart's desire

   Triumphantly possessed;

   Lodged by the ministerial choir

   In thy Redeemer's breast.

   "In condescending love,

   Thy ceaseless prayer he heard,

   And bade thee suddenly remove,

   To thy complete reward.

   "With saints enthroned on high,

   Thou dost thy Lord proclaim,

   And still to God salvation cry, --

   Salvation to the Lamb!

   "O happy, happy soul!

   In ecstasies of praise,

   Long as eternal ages roll,

   Thou seest thy Saviour's face.

   "Redeemed from earth and pain,

   Ah! when shall we ascend,

   And all in Jesus' presence reign

   With our translated friend?"
