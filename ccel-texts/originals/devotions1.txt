ORIGINAL PREFACE

   THE following Translation of the Greek Devotions of Bishop Andrewes is
   made from the Edition of 1675, and has already appeared in a
   publication of the day. It is reprinted in its present form in
   compliance with the suggestion of many persons, who naturally wished to
   possess it simply as a devotional work, apart from its controversial
   bearings. A few alterations have been made in the arrangement of its
   separate parts, as they occur in the present text of the original, but
   only with a view to its answering more fully the purpose for which it
   seems to have been composed, of furnishing a manual of devotion for
   every day of the week. Accordingly, such portions of the work, as were
   obviously without or out of place, have been inserted, where they were
   wanted, in the course of the prayers; or collected together at the end;
   or, if repetitions, omitted. No alterations have been made in the text
   itself; and all transpositions are noted at the foot of the page as
   they occur.

INTRODUCTION.

  BY H. B. SWETE, D.D., F.B.A.

   LANCELOT ANDREWES was born in 1555; in the parish of All Hallows,
   Barking. His early education was received at Cooper's Free School in
   Stepney, and subsequently at Merchant Taylors' School; at the age of
   sixteen he went up to Cambridge, where he became successively scholar,
   fellow, and (1589?1605) master of Pembroke Hall. Ordained in 1580, he
   rose rapidly in his calling, becoming chaplain to Queen Elizabeth in or
   about 1586, canon of St. Paul's in 1589, canon of Westminster in 1597,
   and dean of the Abbey in 1601. Consecrated bishop of Chichester in
   1605, Andrewes was translated to Ely in 1609, and to Winchester in
   1619. From 1616 he was a member of the Privy Council, and from 1618
   dean of the Chapel Royal. His death took place in 1626; his body lies
   on the south side of the high altar at St. Saviour's, Southwark.

   Andrewes lived through the reigns of Elizabeth and James I, and this
   bare chronicle of his life is enough to shew how large a part he took
   in the affairs of both Church and State in those difficult times. By
   temperament and early habit he was a student; he never loved or used
   any games;' if he needed recreation, it' was found in the study of
   Nature. Such a man might gladly have spent his days in the learned
   leisure of College rooms. But circumstances called him to the larger
   life of public service, and he threw himself into it without reserve.
   At St. Paul's he revived the office of penitentiary canon, attending in
   the aisles of the Cathedral during Lent to give spiritual counsel to
   any who sought it. At Westminster the boys of the school were not
   overlooked by the scholarly Dean, who associated himself with them both
   in their studies and their hours of recreation. Under James I he
   attended the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, and took part in the
   preparation of the Authorized Version of 1611. At court he was
   frequently in attendance on the King, and for many years preached
   before him on the great festivals. It was Andrewes who was chosen to
   answer Bellarmine's attack upon the King and the English Church. His
   name appears on Royal Commissions, and on more than one occasion he was
   called to advise the King on perplexing questions of policy. Nor was
   the work of his own dioceses neglected. As Bishop he was munificent in
   his benefactions and untiring in his efforts to raise the standard of
   clerical life, and to secure decency in ritual and conformity to the
   doctrines and order of the Church.

   It was a full life that Andrewes led from boyhood to his death. As
   scholar, courtier, preacher, controversialist, bishop, he could have
   had little leisure, and must often have been harassed by the anxieties
   and wearied by the burdens of his high position and manifold labours.
   But, as his contemporaries witness, nothing seemed, to disturb his
   serenity; the same grave, calm gentleness of manner marked him under
   all conditions. The secret of his victory over outward circumstances is
   disclosed in this book, which admits us to see the Bishop at his
   private prayers: Like the Confessions of St. Augustine, like many of
   the Psalms, the Preces privatae unlock the doors of a sanctuary where a
   saint kneels in fellowship with God.

   The private prayers of Bishop Andrewes were not written for
   publication. They grew up under the hands of the author in hours of
   solitude, perhaps when he was on his knees. That they are written in
   Greek, Hebrew, and Latin confirms this view of their origin; for others
   he would have used the English tongue; to Andrewes himself the three
   learned languages were as familiar and more expressive than English.
   There are other indications that we have here the genuine outpourings
   of the saint's heart. Personal recollections are numerous: the writer
   prays for his schools and college, for the parishes he had served; for
   St. Paul's and. Westminster, for the three dioceses which had been
   entrusted to him, for the men he had educated or ordained; he calls to
   mind that he was born, on a Thursday, and thanks God for the church in
   which he was baptized. Lastly, the original MS., as we learn from one
   who had seen it, bore marks of long and constant use: it was slubbered
   with his pious hands, and watered with his penitential tears.' On his
   deathbed Andrewes gave a copy to his friend William Laud, then Bishop
   of Bath and Wells. But there is no reason to suppose that this book was
   entrusted to Laud for publication, nor. was it in fact published by
   him, or as a whole and in the original until long after Laud's death.
   Some of the devotions appeared in an English translation as early as
   1630, and portions of the original in 1668, but the first edition which
   approached completeness issued from the Oxford Press in 1675.

   But private and personal as the Preces were in their intention and
   original use, they have proved to be eminently fitted for adoption by
   Church people in general. Experience has shewn that Bishop Andrewes'
   private devotions are such as every devout member of the Church of
   England, and, it may almost be added, every good Christian would desire
   to make his own. What is personal is usually limited by the
   circumstances, the outlook, the mentality of the individual; it
   interests us by its individuality, but the field over which it ranges
   is necessarily narrow and may be one with which we ourselves have
   little in common. But the personal devotions of Bishop Andrewes are
   singularly free from this disadvantage. He has poured into them all the
   wealth of a rich nature; he has spent upon them all the resources of a
   mind stored with manifold knowledge, and an experience as wide as his
   learning. There is no pedantry in his prayers; perhaps there is no
   conscious use in them of his great store of materials. Yet the Preces
   privatae embody recollections from most of the great fathers ;of the
   Church--Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian, the Gregories, Chrysostom,
   Jerome, Augustine; from medievil writers such as Alcuin, Anselm, St.
   Bernard, Peter Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, Bradwardine, Gerson; from
   sixteenth?century writers such as Fisher and Erasmus; even the
   classical writers of Greece and Rome occasionally supply a
   phrase--Eutipides, Aristophanes, Horace, Seneca have left their mark.
   Of ancient liturgical books free use is made: we recognize portions of
   the great Horology and Euchology, of the liturgies of St. James and St.
   Basil; the Western Hours, Missal and Manual, several of the Primers,
   the Book of Common Prayer, and Knox's Book of Common Order' are all
   laid under contribution. One of the first scholars of his day, the
   friend of Casaubon and Francis Bacon, at home both in patristic and
   classical lore, and in the newly?opened fields of Nature?study,
   Andrewes poured all the treasures of his wide reading and observation
   into his devotions; yet so utterly free is he from self?consciousness
   or love of display that they may be used by the unlearned without a
   suspicion that they are reaping the fruits of long years of laborious
   study.

   Even more remarkable is the Bishop's singular mastery, over the words
   and thoughts of Holy Scripture. It does not lie in the ready stringing
   together of conventional Scriptural phrases, which neither assists
   devotion nor evinces, any real knowledge of the Bible Rather it is the
   art of the Christian scribe who, like an, experienced householders
   brings forth out of leis treasure things new and old. So steeped is the
   mind of this: great student and preacher of the Word with, Scripture
   that he weaves into the texture of his prayers history, psalm, and
   prophecy, gospel, epistle, and apocalypse, often without regard to the
   literary history or historical order of the books, yet with such
   fitness and success that, they blend Band harmonize and gain fresh
   beauty from contact, as gold and silver and silks of divers colours
   worked into a glorious whole by the deft hands of a cunning artificer.
   It is a use of Holy Scripture which is widely remote from the critical
   and historical methods of our time, but which has its own value as an
   aid to devotion; nor does it often happen that this habit leads
   Andrewes into an interpretation which modern knowledge has shewn to be
   untenable.

   Of the quaintnesses and eccentricities which would render the Bishop's
   sermons, notwithstanding their great merits, inappropriate in the
   modern pulpit, there is scarcely a trace in his devotions. There are a
   few verbal tricks or doubtful positions: a fondness for alliteration,
   as when he twice connects Gethsemane, Gabbatha, Golgotha,' and often
   brings together orthotomein and orthopodein: a tendency to combine
   alternative and inconsistent interpretations, as when he explains
   sanctorum communionem in the Apostles' Creed as the fellowship of holy
   persons in holy things: the too ready acceptance of such traditions as
   that the Angels were created on the second day, and that it was on a
   Friday that man fell; and the first promise of Redemption was made. But
   these defects, if they are such, are easily removed in the use of the
   prayers. More perplexing perhaps to the majority of readers are the
   occasional references to the events and conditions of Andrewes' own
   time:--allusions to the earthquake of 1580, and to those in galleys'
   (the slaves in Barbary corsairs), to the foes of our most holy faith'
   (the Turks); or the use of the technical language of theology, as when
   the incarnation is called the Dispensation,' and the Incarnate is
   described as the Coal of double nature,' and the divine Being as the
   Superessential Essence, or again where penitence after baptism is
   called a second plank.' The book, in fact, to impart its bull measure
   of benefit, should be studied before it is used; the prayers are those
   of a scholar, and they assume a scholar's knowledge and interest in
   history and letters. But they are also the prayers of a saint, and all
   who aim at the saintly life will find in them, notwithstanding
   occasional obscurities, one of their best helps in attaining their end.

   The Private Prayers begin, like the Book of Common Prayer, with forms
   for daily Morning and Evening Prayer, and to these are added separate
   forms for, Morning Prayer on each day of the week. Each of these forms
   embraces certain chief elements of devotion, such as commemoration,
   petition, intercession; acts. of penitence, faith, hope; offering of
   praise and thanksgiving. Beside these forms in which the elements are
   combined, there are separate offices of penitence, faith, thanksgiving,
   and petition which occupy nearly half the book.

   Nothing is more surprising in Andrewes' treatment of these great
   factors of private prayer than the infinite variety of detail which he
   is able to introduce into the constantly recurring sections of his
   work. One would expect to find in fifty pages devoted to penitential
   devotions much wearisome and unedifying repetition; but every page has
   its own presentation of the evil of sin, and the justice and mercy of
   God; its own confessions, petitions, deprecations, hopes. The writer
   gathers up from Scripture every confession uttered by patriarch or
   prophet or psalmist or apostle, and makes it his own; he collects from
   the experiences of life all that aggravates human sin, that exposes its
   depths of ingratitude, its intricacies of self?deceit; every
   consideration drawn from the mercies and the judgments of God which can
   enhance its guilt. Yet the spirit of bondage again to fear' is wholly
   absent from these devotions; the sorrow they express is the sorrow
   after a godly sort' which works a repentance that brings no regret,'
   and not the sorrow of the world, which works death. Members of the
   Church who in the exercise of their discretion abstain from using the
   ministry of private confession and absolution will find no better
   substitute than these acts of penitence, with their intimate revelation
   of personal sinfulness, and their firm trust in God's mercy through
   Christ.

   There is the same breadth of outlook and minuteness of detail in
   Andrewes' intercessions. As Dean Church has written: [1] There is no
   class of men, no condition, no relation of life, no necessity or
   emergency of it, which does not at one time or another rise up before
   his memory, and claim his intercession; infants, children, the young,
   grown men, the middle?aged, the old, prisoners, foreigners, unburied,
   the living and the dead: All estates are remembered: farmers and
   graziers, fleet and fishers, tradesmen and mechanics, down to the
   meanest workmen.' The Church is especially present to Andrewes' mind:
   the Church ecumenical, Eastern, Western, our own'; and for our own
   Church that what is wanting in it may be supplied; what is unsound,
   corrected.'

   In praise and thanksgiving Andrewes is not less helpful than in
   intercession. He teaches us how without loss of reverence to descend
   into the smallest particulars of the mercies personally received.
   Nothing in his life from infancy onwards is forgotten: he thanks God
   for house, kinsfolk; neighbours, friends; for health; good repute
   sufficiency; for parents, honest and good, teachers gentle, colleagues
   like?minded, retainers faithful; for all who have stood me in good
   stead by their writings.' He rises to has highest level when he is
   praising God for all that He is in Himself and has done for man.

   The Bishop's theological position calls for a few words. He was a
   devoted son of the Church of England as she emerged from the troubles
   of the first half of the sixteenth century. But,' to quote Dean Church
   again, [2] in Andrewes; as in Hooker, we come on a wide divergence from
   the language of the early theologians of Elizabeth . . . in Bishop
   Andrewes we see the awakening in the Church of wider knowledge, of
   freedom and independence of thought, of calmer and steadier, judgment.'
   Of his loyalty to the English Reformation there can be no question; but
   he realizes more fully than could have been done in the earlier days of
   the movement the Catholic heritage of the Church, its relations to East
   and West, and not only to the undivided Church of the first few
   centuries. He is conscious of the defects and needs of the Reformed
   Church; he adheres to ancient terms and traditions of which the
   Reformers had been not unnaturally shy. Thus he speaks of St. Mary as
   ever?virgin' and Mother of God.' He is supplied with good hopes,
   touching the remission of sins through penitence and the works thereof,
   by the power of the thrice holy keys and sacraments that are in the
   Church' of God. He prays repeatedly for the faithful departed and asks
   for them rest and light.' The Eucharistic teaching of the short office
   for use before and at the Liturgy implies a full acceptance of the
   patristic doctrine: the Mysteries are immaculate, awful, quickening,
   saving; they are unto remission of sins, healing of the sicknesses of
   the soul, provision for the journey of ghostly life, a pledge of
   renunciation.' But of Roman assertions there is no trace. Nowhere in
   the devotions are the saints invoked; they are commemorated before God,
   and He is thanked for them, but there is no ora pro nobis, not even, a
   prayer that God will hear their intercessions for us. Nowhere is there
   any approach to the scholastic doctrine of Transubstantiation; there is
   no cult of the Blessed Sacrament, no desire for access' to it, apart
   from communion. The whole tone of the Preces privatae is akin to that
   of the Greek liturgies. It is interesting to note, by the way, that
   Andrewes seems, with some early Greek forms, to have attributed the
   consecration of the Bread and Wine to the Son rather than to the Holy
   Spirit: Thou,' he says, addressing our Lord, art with us invisibly to
   hallow the gifts that are set forth, and those for whom they are
   brought.'

   But the theology of the Preces privatae does not largely concern itself
   with controversial questions. It is for the most part an interpretation
   of the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds read in the light of the experience
   of life. The Incarnation and Atonement, the Resurrection and Ascension,
   the Coming of the Spirit and His work in the Catholic Church, the
   heavenly life and the future Coming of our Lord, devotionally handled,
   supply abundant materials, for prayer and praise. The connexion of
   these great doctrines one with another, the relation in which they all
   stand to the spiritual life of men, are continually recalled to the
   mind. No place is left for the spurious growth of devotions founded on
   baseless theory which disfigure many modern manuals, not for the false
   sentiment and conventional phrases of an opposite school. In his
   private prayers Bishop Andrewes left the Church a legacy which, come
   what may, will always be one of her chief treasures; an heirloom,
   second only in value to the Book of Common Prayer, the spirit of which
   it carries on from the Church to the closet.' [3]

   The translation of the Greek devotions reprinted in this volume is due
   to John Henry Newman; it was made in his Anglican days for Tracts For
   the Times, where it first appeared as Tract lxxviii (1840). That of the
   Latin prayers which form the accompanying volume is from the pen of
   John Mason Neale, who published it in 1844 as a continuation of
   Newman's. Newman's version was made from the Clarendon Press text of
   1675.

CONFESSION

   Essence beyond essence,
   Nature increate,
   Framer of the world,
   I set Thee, Lord, before my face,
   and I lift up my soul unto Thee.
   I worship Thee on my knees,
   and humble myself under Thy mighty hand.
   I stretch forth my hands unto Thee,
   my soul gaspeth unto Thee as a thirsty land.
   I smite on my breast
   and say with the Publican,
   God be merciful to me a sinner,
   the chief of sinners;
   to the sinner above the Publican,
   be merciful as to the Publican.
   Father of mercies,
   I beseech Thy fatherly affection;
   despise me not,
   an unclean worm, a dead dog,
   a putrid corpse,
   despise not Thou the work of Thine own hands,
   despise not Thine own image
   though branded by sin.
   Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean;
   Lord, only say the word, and I shall be cleansed.
   And Thou, my Saviour Christ,
   Christ my Saviour,
   Saviour of sinners, of whom I am chief,
   despise me not,
   despise me not, O Lord,
   despise not the cost of Thy blood,
   who am called by Thy Name;
   but look on me with those eyes
   with which Thou didst look upon
   Magdalene at the feast,
   Peter in the hall,
   the thief on the wood;--
   that with the thief I may entreat Thee humbly,
   Remember me, Lord, in Thy kingdom;
   that with Peter I may bitterly weep and say,
   O that mine eyes were a fountain of tears
   that I might weep day and night;
   that with Magdalene, I may hear Thee say,
   Thy sins be forgiven thee,
   and with her may love much,
   for many sins yea manifold
   have been forgiven me.
   And Thou, All?holy, Good, and
   Life?giving Spirit,
   despise me not, Thy breath,
   despise not Thine own holy things;
   but turn Thee again, O Lord,
   at the last,
   and be gracious unto Thy servant.
     __________________________________________________________________

COMMENDATION

   Blessed art Thou, O Lord;
   Our God,
   the God of our Fathers;
   who turnest the shadow of death into
   the morning;
   and lightenest the face of the earth;
   who separatest darkness from the face
   of the light;
   and banishest night and bringest back
   the day;
   who lightenest mine eyes,
   that I sleep not in death;
   who deliverest me from the terror by
   night,
   from the pestilence that walketh in
   darkness;
   who drivest sleep from mine eyes,
   and slumber from mine eyelids;
   who makest the outgoings of the
   morning and evening
   to praise Thee;
   because I laid me down and slept and
   rose up again,
   for the Lord sustained me;
   because I waked and beheld,
   and my sleep was sweet unto me.
   Blot out as a thick cloud
   my transgressions,
   and as a cloud my sins;
   grant me to be a child of light,
   a child of the day,
   to walk soberly, holily, honestly,
   as in the day;
   vouchsafe to keep, me this day
   without sin.
   Thou who upholdest the falling and .
   liftest the fallen,
   let me not harden my heart
   in provocation, or temptation,
   or deceitfulness of any sin.
   Moreover, deliver me to?day
   from the snare of the hunter
   and from the noisome pestilence;
   from the arrow that flieth by day,
   from the sickness that destroyeth in
   the noon day.
   Defend this day against my evil,
   against the evil of this day
   defend Thou me.
   Let not my days be spent in vanity,
   nor my years in sorrow.
   One day telleth another,
   and one night certifieth another.
   O let me hear Thy loving?kindness
   betimes in the morning,
   for in Thee is my trust;
   shew Thou me the way that I should
   walk in,
   for I lift up my soul unto Thee.
   Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies,
   for I flee unto Thee.
   Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth
   Thee,
   for Thou art my God;
   Let Thy loving Spirit lead me forth
   into the land of righteousness.
   Quicken me, O Lord,
   for Thy Name's sake,
   and for Thy righteousness' sake
   bring my soul out of trouble;
   remove from me foolish imaginations,
   inspire those which are good
   and pleasing in Thy sight.
   Turn away mine eyes
   lest they behold vanity;
   let mine eyes look right on,
   and let mine eyelids look straight
   before me.
   Hedge up mine ears with thorns
   lest they incline to undisciplined words.
   Give me early the ear to hear,
   and open mine ears to the instruction
   of Thy oracles.
   Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth,
   and keep the door of my lips.
   Let my, word be seasoned with salt,
   that it may minister grace to the hearers.
   Let no deed be grief unto me
   nor offence of heart.
   Let me do, some work
   for which Thou wilt remember me, Lord,
   for good,
   and spare me according to the greatness
   of Thy mercy.
   Into Thine hands I commend
   my spirit, soul, and body,
   which Thou hast created, redeemed,
   regenerated,
   O Lord, Thou God of truth;
   and together with me
   all mine and all that belongs to me.
   Thou hast vouchsafed them to me,
   Lord, in Thy goodness.
   Guard us from all evil,
   guard our souls,
   I beseech Thee, O Lord.
   Guard us without falling,
   and place us immaculate
   in the presence of Thy glory
   in that day.
   Guard my going out and my coming in
   henceforth and for ever.
   Prosper, I pray Thee, Thy servant this
   day,
   and, grant him mercy
   in the sight of those who meet him.
   O God, make speed to save me,
   O Lord, make haste to help me.
   O turn Thee then unto me,
   and have mercy upon me;
   give Thy strength unto Thy servant,
   and help the son of Thine handmaid.
   Shew some token upon me for good,
   that they who hate me may see it and
   be ashamed,
   because Thou, Lord, hast holpen me
   and comforted me.

                          ORDER OF EVENING PRAYER [6]
     __________________________________________________________________

MEDITATION

   THE day is gone;
   and I give Thee thanks, O Lord.
   Evening is at hand,
   make it bright unto us.
   As day has its evening
   so also has life;
   the even of life is age;
   age has overtaken me,
   make it bright unto us.
   Cast me not away in the time of age;
   forsake me not when my strength
   faileth me.
   Even to my old age be Thou He,
   and even to hoar hairs carry me;
   do Thou make, do Thou bear,
   do Thou carry and deliver me.
   Abide with me, Lord,
   for it is toward evening,
   and the day is far spent
   of this fretful life.
   Let Thy strength be made perfect
   in my weakness.

   Day is fled and gone,
   life too is going,
   this lifeless life.
   Night cometh,
   and cometh death,
   the deathless death.
   Near as is the end of day,
   so too the end of life:
   We then, also remembering it,
   beseech of Thee
   for the close of our life,
   that Thou wouldest direct it in
   peace,
   Christian, acceptable,
   sinless, shameless,
   and, if it please Thee, painless,
   Lord, O Lord,
   gathering us together
   under the feet of thine Elect,
   when Thou wilt, and as Thou wilt,
   only without shame and sins.
   Remember we the days of darkness,
   for they shall be many,
   lest we be cast into outer darkness.
   Remember we to outstrip the night
   doing some good thing.
   Near is judgment;--
   a good and acceptable answer
   at the dreadful and fearful judgment?seat
   of Jesus Christ,
   vouchsafe to us, O Lord.
   By night I lift up my hands in the
   sanctuary,
   and praise the Lord.
   The Lord hath granted
   His loving?kindness in the day time;
   and in the night season did I sing of
   Him,
   and made my prayer unto the God of
   my life.
   As long as I live will I magnify Thee on
   this manner,
   and lift up my hands, in Thy Name.
   Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight
   as the incense,
   and let the lifting up of my hands
   be an evening sacrifice.
   Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,
   the God of our fathers,
   who hast created the changes of days and
   nights,
   who givest songs in the night,
   who hast delivered us from the evil of
   this day,
   who hast not cut off like a weaver my
   life,
   nor from day even to night made an
   end of me.
     __________________________________________________________________

CONFESSION

   Lord,
   as we add day to day
   so sin to sin.
   The just falleth seven times a day;
   and I, an exceeding sinner,
   seventy times seven;
   wonderful, a horrible thing, O Lord.
   But I turn with groans
   from my evil ways,
   and I return into my heart,
   and with all my. heart I turn to Thee,
   O God of penitents and Saviour of
   sinners;
   and evening by evening I will return
   in the innermost marrow of my soul;
   and my soul out of the deep
   crieth unto Thee.
   I have sinned, O Lord, against Thee,
   heavily against Thee;
   alas, alas, woe is me! for my misery.
   I repent, O me! I repent, spare me,
   O Lord,
   I repent, O me, I repent,
   help Thou my impenitence.
   Be appeased, spare me, O Lord;
   be appeased, have mercy on me;
   I said, Lord, have mercy upon me,
   heal my soul, for I have sinned against
   Thee.

   Have mercy upon me, O Lord,
   after Thy great goodness,
   according to the multitude of Thy mercies
   do away mine offences.
   Remit the guilt,
   heap the wound,
   blot out the stains,
   clear away the shame,
   rescue from the tyranny,
   and make me not a public example.
   O bring Thou me out of my trouble,
   cleanse Thou me from secret fault,
   keep back Thy servant also from
   presumptuous sins.
   My wanderings of mind
   and idle talking
   lay not to my charge.
   Remove the dark and muddy flood
   of foul and wicked thoughts.
   O Lord,
   I have destroyed myself;
   whatever I have done amiss,
   pardon mercifully.
   Deal not with us after our sins,
   neither reward us after our iniquities.
   Look mercifully upon our infirmities;
   and for the glory of Thy All?holy Name,
   turn from us all those ills and miseries,
   which by our sins, and by us through
   them,
   are most righteously and worthily
   deserved.
     __________________________________________________________________

COMMENDATION

   To my weariness, O Lord,
   vouchsafe Thou rest,
   to my exhaustion
   renew Thou strength.
   Lighten mine eyes that I sleep not in
   death.
   Deliver me from the terror by night,
   the pestilence that walketh in darkness.
   Supply me with healthy sleep,
   and to pass through this night without
   fear.
   O keeper of Israel,
   who neither slumberest nor sleepest,
   guard me this night from all evil,
   guard my soul, O Lord.
   Visit me with the visitation of Thine own,
   reveal to me wisdom in the visions of
   the night.
   If not, for I am not worthy, not worthy;
   at least, O loving Lord,
   let sleep be to me a breathing time
   as from toil, so from sin.
   Yea, O Lord,
   nor let me in my dreams imagine
   what may anger Thee,
   what may defile me.
   Let not my loins be, filled with illusions,
   yea, let my reins chasten me in the night
   season,
   yet without grievous terror.
   Preserve me from the black sleep of sin;
   all earthly and evil thoughts
   put to sleep within me.
   Grant to me light sleep,
   rid of all imaginations
   fleshly and satanical.
   Lord, Thou knowest
   how sleepless are mine unseen foes,
   and how feeble my wretched flesh,
   who madest me;
   shelter me with, the wing of Thy pity;
   awaken me at the fitting time,
   the time of prayer;
   and give me to seek Thee early,
   for Thy glory, and for Thy service.

   Here use the form of Intercession, No. 3.

   Into Thy hands, O Lord, I commend
   myself,
   my spirit, soul, and body:
   Thou didst make, and didst redeem
   them;
   and together with me, all my friends
   and all that belongs to me.
   Thou hast vouchsafed them to me, Lord,
   in Thy goodness.
   Guard my lying down and my rising up,
   from henceforth and for ever.
   Let me remember Thee on my bed,
   and search out my spirit;
   let me wake up and be present with
   Thee;
   let me lay me down in peace,
   and take my rest:
   for it is Thou, Lord, only
   that makest me dwell in safety.

                                  FOR THE WEEK
     __________________________________________________________________

THE FIRST DAY
     __________________________________________________________________

  INTRODUCTION

   THROUGH the tender mercies of
   our God
   the day?spring from on high hath
   visited us.
   Glory be to Thee, O Lord, glory to Thee.
   Creator of the light,
   and Enlightener of the world,--
   of the visible light,
   The Sun's ray, a flame of fire,
   day and night,
   evening and morning,--
   of the light invisible,
   the revelation of God,
   writings of the Law,
   oracles of Prophets,
   music of Psalms,
   instruction of Proverbs,
   experience of Histories,--
   light which never sets.
   God is the Lord who hath shewed us
   light;
   bind the sacrifice with cords,
   yea even unto the horns of the altar.

   O by Thy resurrection raise us up
   unto newness of life,
   supplying to us frames of repentance.
   The God of peace,
   who did bring again from the dead
   the great Shepherd of the sheep,
   through the blood of the everlasting
   covenant,
   our Lord Jesus Christ,
   perfect us in every good work,
   to do His will,
   working in us what is acceptable before
   Him,
   through Jesus Christ,
   to whom be glory for ever.

   Thou who didst send down on Thy
   disciples on this day
   Thy Thrice?holy Spirit,
   withdraw not Thou the gift, O Lord,
   from us,
   but renew it in its, day by day,
   who ask Thee for it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CONFESSION

   Merciful and pitiful Lord,
   Long?suffering and full of pity,
   I have sinned, Lord,
   I have sinned against Thee;
   O me, wretched that I am,
   I have sinned, Lord, against Thee
   much and grievously,
   in attending on vanities and lies.
   I conceal nothing:
   I make no excuses.
   I give Thee glory, O Lord, this day,
   I denounce against myself my sins;
   Truly I have sinned before the Lord,
   and thus and thus have I done.
   I have sinned and perverted
   that which was right,
   and it profited me not.
   And what shall I now say?
   or with what shall I open my mouth?
   What shall I answer;
   seeing I have done it?
   Without plea, without defence,
   self?condemned, am I.
   I have destroyed myself.
   Unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth
   righteousness,
   but unto me confusion of face,
   because Thou art just in all that is come
   upon me,
   for Thou hast done right,
   but I have done wickedly.
   And now, Lord, what is my hope?
   Truly my hope is even in Thee,
   if hope of salvation remain to me,
   if Thy loving?kindness cover
   the multitude of my iniquities.
   O remember, what my substance is,
   the work of Thine hands,
   the likeness of Thy countenance,
   the cost of Thy blood,
   a name from Thy Name,
   a sheep of Thy pasture,
   a son of the covenant.
   Despise not Thou the work of Thine
   own hands.
   Hast Thou made for nought
   Thine own image and likeness?
   for nought, if Thou destroy it.
   And what profit is there in my blood?
   Thine enemies will rejoice.
   May they never rejoice, O Lord!
   Grant not to them my destruction.
   Look upon the face of Thine Anointed,
   and in the Blood of Thy covenant,
   the propitiation for the sins of the whole
   world,
   Lord, be propitious unto me; a sinner;
   even unto me, O Lord, of sinners
   chief, chiefest and greatest;
   For Thy Name's sake be merciful unto
   my sin,
   for it is great: it exceeds.
   For Thy Name's sake, that Name,
   beside which, none other under heaven
   is given among men,
   whereby we must be saved,
   the Spirit Himself helping our infirmities,
   and making intercession for us;
   with plaints unutterable.
   For the tender yearnings of the Father,
   the bloody wounds of the Son,
   the unutterable plaints of the Spirit,
   give ear, O Lord, have mercy; O Lord,
   O Lord, hearken and do;
   defer not, for Thine own sake,
   O my God.
   For me, I forget not my sins,
   they are ever before me;
   I remember them in the bitterness of my
   soul;
   I am anxious about them;
   I turn away and groan,
   I have indignation and revenge
   and wrath against myself.
   I despise and bruise my own self,
   that my penitence, Lord, O Lord
   is not deeper, is not fuller;
   help Thou mine impenitence.
   And more, and still more,
   pierce Thou, rend, crush my heart;
   and remit, forgive, pardon
   what things are grief to me,
   and offence of heart.
   Cleanse Thou me from secret faults,
   and keep Thy servant also from
   presumptuous sins.
   Magnify Thy mercies towards the
   wretched sinner
   and in season, Lord, say to me,
   Be of good cheer;
   thy sins are forgiven thee;
   My grace is sufficient for thee.
   Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
   Why art thou so heavy, O my soul?
   and why art thou so disquieted
   within thee?
   Return unto thy rest, O my soul,
   for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
   O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine
   indignation,
   neither chasten me in Thy displeasure.
   I said, I will confess my sins unto the
   Lord,
   and so Thou forgavest the wickedness
   of my sin.
   Lord, thou knowest all my desire,
   and my groaning is not hid from
   Thee.
   Have mercy upon me, O God,
   after Thy great goodness,
   according to the multitude of Thy
   mercies
   do away mine offences.
   Thou shalt arise, and have mercy on me,
   O Lord,
   for it is time that Thou have mercy
   upon me,
   yea, the time is come.
   If Thou, O Lord, shouldest mark
   iniquities,
   O Lord, who shall stand?
   Enter not into judgment with Thy servant,
   O Lord,
   for in Thy sight shall no man living be
   justified.

   10. to be desirous not to lust,
   not to lust passionately,
   not to go after lusts.

   Hold Thou me in with bit and bridle,
   lest I fall from Thee.
   O Lord compel me to come in to Thee.

  PROFESSION

   I believe, O Lord,
   in Thee, Father, Word, Spirit, One God;
   that by Thy fatherly love and power
   all things were created;--
   that by Thy goodness and love to man
   all things have been begun anew
   in Thy Word,--
   Who for us men and for our salvation,
   was made flesh,
   was conceived and born,
   suffered and was crucified,
   died and was buried,
   descended and rose again,
   ascended and sat down,
   will return and will repay;--
   that by the shining?forth and working
   of Thy Holy Spirit,
   hath been called, out of the whole
   world
   a peculiar people into a polity,
   in belief of the truth
   and sanctity of living:--
   that in it we are partakers
   of the communion of saints
   and forgiveness of sins
   in this world;--
   that in it we are waiting
   for resurrection of the flesh
   and life everlasting
   in the world to come.--
   This most holy faith
   which was once delivered to the saints
   I believe, O Lord;
   help Thou mine unbelief,
   and vouchsafe to me
   to love the Father for His fatherly love,
   to reverence the Almighty for His
   power,
   as a faithful Creator, to commit my
   soul to Him in well doing;
   vouchsafe to me to partake
   from Jesus of salvation,
   from Christ of anointing,
   from the Only?begotten of adoption;
   to worship the Lord
   for His conception in faith,
   for His birth in humility,
   for His sufferings in patience and hatred
   of sin;
   for His Cross to crucify beginnings,
   for His death to mortify the flesh,
   for His burial to bury evil thoughts in
   good works, for His descent to meditate upon hell,
   for His resurrection upon newness of life,
   for His ascension; to mind things above,
   for His sitting on high, to mind the good
   things on His right,
   for His return, to fear His second
   appearance,
   for judgment, to judge myself ere I be
   judged.
   From the Spirit
   vouchsafe me the breath of salutary
   grace.
   In the Holy Catholic Church
   to have my own calling, and holiness,
   and portion,
   and a fellowship
   of her sacred rites, and prayers,
   fastings and groans,
   vigils, tears, and sufferings,
   for assurance of remission of sins,
   for hope of resurrection and translation
   to eternal life.

   bless our children among us,
   to advance in wisdom as in stature,
   and in favour with Thee and with
   men.
   Thou who wouldest have us provide for
   our own,

   to the flesh,
   grant me to speak peace concerning
   them,
   and to seek their good.
   Thou who willest us to make return
   to our benefactors,
   remember; Lord, for good,
   all from whom I have received good;
   keep them alive that they may be blessed
   upon earth,
   and deliver them not
   into the will of their enemies.
   Thou who hast noted
   the man who neglects his own, as worse
   than an infidel,
   remember in Thy good pleasure
   all those in my household.
   Peace be to my house,
   the Son of peace upon all in it.
   Thou who wouldest that our
   righteousness exceed
   the righteousness of sinners,
   grant me, Lord,
   to love those who love me;

   Thou who wouldest that we overcome

   who remember me in their, prayers,
   or whom I have promised to remember
   in mine.
   Thou who acceptest diligence in every
   good work,
   remember, Lord,
   as if they prayed to Thee,
   those who for any good reason
   give not time to prayer.
   Arise, and have mercy
   on those who are in the last necessity,
   for it is time that thou hast mercy
   upon them,
   yea the time is come.
   Have mercy on them, O Lord,
   as on me also, when in extremities.
   Remember, Lord,
   infants, children, the grown, the young,
   the middle?aged, the old,
   hungry, thirsty, naked, sick,
   prisoners, foreigners, friendless,
   unburied,
   all in extreme age and weakness,
   possessed with devils,
   and tempted to suicide,
   troubled by unclean spirits,
   the hopeless, the sick in soul or body,
   the weak?hearted,
   all in prison and chains,
   all under sentence of death;
   orphans, widows, foreigners, travellers,
   voyagers,
   women with child, women who give
   suck,
   all in bitter servitude, or mines, or
   galleys,
   or in loneliness.
   Thou, Lord, shalt save both man
   and beast,
   how excellent is Thy mercy,
   O God!
   And the children of men shall put
   their trust
   under the shadow of Thy wings.
   The Lord bless us, and keep us,
   and show the light of His countenance
   upon us,
   And be merciful unto us,
   The Lord lift up His countenance
   upon us,
   And give us peace!
   I commend to Thee, O Lord,
   my soul, and my body,
   my mind, and my thoughts,
   my prayers, and my vows,
   my senses, and my limbs,
   my words, and my works, [7]
   my life, and my death;
   my brothers, and my sisters,
   and their children;
   my friends, my benefactors,
   my well-wishers,
   those who have a claim on me;
   my kindred, and my neighbours,
   my country, and all Christendom.
   I commend to Thee, Lord,
   my impulses, and my startings,
   my intentions, and my attempts,
   my going out, and my coming in,
   my sitting down, and my rising up.

  PRAISE

   Up with our hearts;
   we lift them to the Lord.
   O how very meet, and right, and fitting,
   and due,
   in all, and for all,
   at all times, places, manners,
   in every season, every spot,
   everywhere, always, altogether,
   to remember Thee, to worship Thee,
   to confess to Thee, to praise Thee,
   to bless Thee, to hymn Thee,
   to give thanks to Thee,
   Maker, nourisher, guardian, governor,
   preserver, worker, perfecter of all,
   Lord and Father,
   King and God,
   fountain of life and immortality,
   treasure of everlasting goods.
   Whom the heavens hymn,
   and the heaven of heavens,
   the Angels and all the heavenly powers,
   one to other crying continually,--
   and we the while, weak and unworthy,
   under their feet,--
   Holy, Holy, Holy
   Lord the God of Hosts;
   full is the whole heaven,
   and the whole earth,
   of the majesty of Thy glory.
   Blessed be the glory of the Lord
   out of His place,
   For His Godhead, His mysteriousness,
   His height, His sovereignty,
   His almightiness,
   His eternity, His providence.
   The Lord is my strength, my stony rock,
   and my defence,
   my deliverer, my succour, my buckler,
   the horn also of my salvation
   and my refuge.

THE SECOND DAY
     __________________________________________________________________

  INTRODUCTION

   MY voice shalt Thou hear betimes,
   O Lord,
   early in the morning
   will I direct my payer unto Thee,
   and will look up.
   Blessed art Thou., O Lord,
   who didst create the firmament of heaven,
   the heavens and the heaven of heavens,
   the heavenly powers,
   Angels, Archangels,
   Cherubim, Seraphim,
   waters above the heavens,
   mists and exhalations,
   for showers, dew, hail, snow as wool,
   hoar frost as ashes, ice as morsels,
   clouds from the ends of the earth,
   lightnings, thunders, winds out of Thy
   treasures, storms;
   waters beneath the heavens,
   for drinking and for bathing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CONFESSION

   I will confess my sins,
   and the sins of my fathers,
   for I have transgressed ?\and neglected
   Thee, O Lord,
   and walked perversely before Thee.
   Set not, O Lord, set not my misdeeds
   before Thee,
   nor my life in the light of Thy
   countenance,
   But pardon the iniquity of Thy servant,
   according to Thy great mercy;
   as Thou hast been merciful to him from
   a child,
   even so now.
   I have sinned, what shall I do unto
   Thee,
   O Thou preserver of men?
   Why hast Thou set me as a mark
   against Thee,
   so that I am a burden to myself?
   O pardon my transgression,
   and take away mine iniquity.
   Deliver me from going down to the pit,
   for Thou hast found a ransom.
   Have mercy on me, Son of David,
   Lord, help me.
   Yea, Lord, even the dogs eat of the
   crumbs
   which fall from their masters' table.
   Have patience with me, Lord,
   yet I have not wherewith to pay,
   I confess to Thee;
   forgive me the whole debt,
   I beseech Thee.
   How long wilt Thou forget me, O Lord?
   for ever?
   How long wilt Thou hide Thy face
   from me?
   How long shall I seek counsel in my soul,
   and be vexed in my heart day and night?
   How long shall mine enemies triumph
   over me?
   Consider and hear me, O Lord my God,
   lighten mine eyes that I sleep not
   in death,
   lest mine enemy say I have prevailed
   against him,
   for if I be cast down, they that trouble
   me will rejoice at it;
   but my trust is in Thy mercy.

THE THIRD DAY
     __________________________________________________________________

  INTRODUCTION

   O GOD, Thou art my God,
   early will I seek Thee.
   Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
   who gatheredst the water into the sea,
   and broughtest to sight the earth,
   and madest to sprout
   herb and fruit?tree.
   There are the depths and the sea
   as on an heap,
   lakes, rivers, springs;
   earth, continent, and isles,
   mountains, hills, and valleys;
   glebe, meadows, glades,
   green pasture, corn, and hay;
   herbs and flowers
   for food, enjoyment, medicine;
   fruit?trees bearing
   wine, oil, and spices,
   and trees for wood;
   and things beneath the earth,
   stones, metals, minerals, coal,
   blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CONFESSION

   Who can understand his errors
   Cleanse Thou me from secret faults.
   Keep back Thy servant also from
   presumptuous sins,
   lest they have the dominion over me.
   For Thy Name's sake,
   be merciful unto my sin,
   for it is great.
   My iniquities have taken such hold
   upon me
   that I am not able to look up,
   yea, they are more in number than the
   hairs of my head,
   and my heart hath failed me,
   Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me,
   Make haste, O Lord, to help me.
   Magnify Thy mercies upon me,
   O Thou who savest them that trust in
   Thee.
   I said, Lord, have mercy upon me,
   heal my soul,
   for I have dinned against Thee;
   I have sinned, but I am confounded,
   and I turn from my evil ways,
   and I turn unto mine own heart,
   and with my whole heart I turn unto
   Thee;
   and I seek Thy face,
   and I beseech Thee, saying,
   I have sinned,
   I have committed iniquity,
   I have done unjustly.
   I know, O Lord, the plague of my heart,
   and lo, I turn to Thee with all my heart,
   and with all my strength.
   And Thou, O Lord, now from Thy
   dwelling?place,
   and from the glorious throne of Thy
   kingdom in heaven,
   O hear the prayer
   and the supplication of Thy servant;
   and be propitious towards Thy servant
   and heal his soul.
   O God, be merciful to me a sinner,
   be merciful to me the chief of sinners.
   Father, I have sinned against heaven,
   and before Thee,
   and am no more worthy to be called Thy
   son,
   make me one of Thy hired servants;
   Make me one, or even the last,
   or the least among all.
   What profit is there in my blood,
   when I go down to the pit?
   shall the dust give thanks unto Thee?
   or shall it declare Thy truth?
   Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me;
   Lord, be Thou my helper;
   Turn my heaviness into joy,
   my dreamings into earnestness,
   my falls into clearings of myself,
   my guilt, my offence into indignation,
   my sin into fear,
   my transgression into vehement desire,
   my unrighteousness into strictness,
   my pollution into revenge.

  PRAYER FOR GRACE

   Hosanna in the highest. [9]
   Remember me, O Lord,
   with the favour that Thou bearest unto
   Thy people,

   that I may see the felicity of Thy chosen,
   and rejoice in the gladness of Thy people,
   and give thanks with Thine inheritance.
   There is glory which shall be revealed;
   for when the judge cometh
   some shall see Thy face cheerful,
   and shall be placed on the right,
   and shall hear those most welcome
   words,
   "Come, ye blessed."
   They shall be caught up in clouds
   to meet the Lord;
   they shall enter into gladness,
   they shall enjoy the sight of Him,
   they shall be ever with Him.
   'These alone, only these are blessed
   among the sons of men.
   O to me the meanest grant the meanest
   place,
   there under their feet;
   under the feet of Thine elect,
   the meanest among them.
   And that this may be;
   let me find grace in Thy sight
   to have grace; (Heb. xii. 28)
   so as to serve Thee acceptably
   with reverence and godly fear.
   Let me find that second grace,
   not to receive in vain (2 Cor. vi. 1)
   the first grace,
   not to came short of it; (Heb. xii. 15)
   yea, not to neglect it, (1Tim. iv. 14)
   so as to fall from it, (Gal. v. 4.)
   but to stir it up, (2 Tim. i. 6)
   so as to increase in it, (2 Pet. iii. 18)
   yea, to abide in it
   till the end of my life.
   And O, perfect for me what is lacking
   of faith, of hopeof Thy gifts,
   help Thou mine unbelief,
   establish my trembling hope,
   of lovekindle its smoking flax.
   Shed abroad Thy love in my heart,
   so that I may love Thee,
   my friend in Thee, my enemy for Thee.
   O Thou who givest grace to the humble?minded,
   also give me?grace to be humble?minded.
   O Thou who never failest those who fear
   Thee,
   my Fear and my Hope,
   let me fear one thing only,
   the fearing ought more than Thee.
   As I would that men should do to me
   so may I do to them;
   not to have thoughts beyond what I
   should think,
   but to have thoughts unto sobriety.
   Shine on those who sit in darkness,
   and the shadow of death;
   guide our feet into the way of peace,
   that we may have the same thoughts
   one with another,
   rightly to divide, rightly to walk,
   to edify,
   with one accord, with one mouth
   to glorify God;
   and if ought otherwise,
   to walk in the same rule
   as far as we have attained;
   to maintain order,
   decency and stedfastness.

  PRAISE

   Thou. [11] O Lord, art praised in Sion,
   and unto Thee shall the vow be
   performed in Jerusalem.
   Thou art worthy, O Lord our God,
   the Holy One,
   to receive glory, and honour, and power.
   Thou that hearest the prayer,
   unto Thee shall all flesh come,
   my flesh shall come.
   My misdeeds prevail against me,
   O be Thou merciful unto our sins;
   that I may come and give thanks
   with all Thy works,
   and bless Thee with Thy holy ones.
   O Lord, open Thou my lips,
   and my mouth shall shew forth Thy
   praise.
   My soul doth praise the Lord,
   for the goodness He hath done
   to the whole creation,
   and to the whole race of men;
   for Thy mercies towards myself,
   soul, body, and estate,
   gifts of grace, nature, and fortune;
   for all benefits received,
   for all successes, now or heretofore,
   for any good thing done;
   for health, credit, competency,
   safety, gentle estate, quiet.
   Thou hast not cut off as a weaver my life,
   nor from day even to night made an end
   of me.
   He hath vouchsafed me life and breath
   until this hour,
   from childhood, youth, and hitherto
   even unto age.
   He holdeth our soul in life
   and suffereth not our feet to slip;
   rescuing me from perils, sicknesses,
   poverty, bondage,
   public shame, evil chances;
   keeping me from perishing in my sins,
   fully waiting my conversion,
   leaving in me return into my heart,
   remembrance of my latter end,
   shame, horror, grief,
   for my past sins;
   fuller and larger, larger and fuller,
   more and still more, O my Lord,
   storing me with good hope
   of their remission,
   through repentance and its works,
   in the power of the thrice?holy Keys,
   and the mysteries in Thy Church.
   Wherefore day by day
   for these Thy benefits towards me,
   which I remember,--
   wherefore also for others very many
   which I have let slip
   from their number,
   from my forgetfulness,--
   for those which I wished, knew
   and asked,
   and those l asked not, knew not,
   wished not,--
   I confess and give thanks to Thee,
   I bless and praise Thee, as, is fit,
   and every day,
   And I pray with my whole soul,
   and with my whole mind I pray.
   Glory be to Thee, O Lord, glory to
   Thee;
   glory to Thee,
   and glory to Thine All-holy Name,
   for all Thy Divine perfections in them;
   for Thine incomprehensible and
   unimaginable goodness,
   and Thy pity towards sinners
   and unworthy men,
   and towards me of all sinners
   far the most unworthy.
   Yea, O Lord,
   for this, and for the rest,
   Glory to Thee,
   and praise, and blessing,
   and thanksgiving,
   with the voices and concert of voices
   of Angels and of men,
   of all Thy saints in heaven,
   and all Thy creatures in heaven or earth,
   and of me, beneath their feet,
   unworthy and wretched sinner,
   Thy abject creature,
   now, in this day and hour,
   and every day till my last breath,
   and till the end of the world,
   and for ages upon ages.

THE FOURTH DAY
     __________________________________________________________________

  INTRODUCTION

   I HAVE thought upon Thee, O Lord,
   when I was waking,
   for Thou hast been my helper.
   Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
   who madest the two Lights,
   Sun and Moon,
   greater and lesser,
   and the stars
   for light, for signs, for seasons,
   spring, summer, autumn, winter,
   days, weeks, months, years,
   to rule over day and night.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CONFESSION

   Behold, Thou art angry,
   for we have sinned.
   We are all as an unclean thing,
   and all our righteousnesses
   as filthy rags.
   We all do fade as a leaf,
   and our iniquities, like the wind,
   have taken us away.
   But now, O Lord, Thou art our Father,
   we are clay, all Thy handiwork.
   Be not wroth very sore,
   nor remember iniquity for ever,
   behold, see, we beseech Thee,
   we are all Thy people.
   O Lord, though our iniquities testify
   against us,
   do Thou it for Thy Name's sake;
   for our backslidings are many,
   we have sinned against Thee.
   Yet Thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us,
   and we are called by Thy Name,
   leave us, not.
   O Hope of Israel,
   The Saviour thereof in time of trouble,
   why shouldest Thou be as a stranger in
   the land,
   and as a wayfaring man that turneth
   aside to tarry for a night?
   why shouldest Thou be as a man
   astonished,
   as a mighty man that cannot save?
   Be merciful to our unrighteousnesses,
   and our iniquities remember no more.
   Lord, I am carnal,
   sold under sin;
   there dwelleth in me, that is, in my flesh,
   no good thing;
   for the good that I would, I do not,
   but the evil which I would not, that I do.
   I consent unto the law that it is good,
   I delight in it after the inner man;
   But I see another law in my members,
   warring against the law of my mind,
   and enslaving me to the law of sin.
   Wretched man that I am,
   who shall deliver me from the body of
   this death?
   I thank God through Jesus Christ,
   that where sin abounded,
   grace hath much more?abounded.
   O Lord, Thy goodness leadeth me to
   repentance:
   O give me sometime repentance
   to recover me from the snare of the devil,
   who am taken captive by him, at his will.
   Sufficient for me the past time of my life
   to have done the will of lusts,
   walking in lasciviousness, revelling,
   drunkenness,
   and in other excess of profligacy.
   O Lamb without blemish and without
   spot,
   who hast redeemed me with Thy
   precious Blood,
   in that very Blood pity me and save me;
   in that Blood, and in that very Name,
   besides which is none other under heaven
   given among men,
   by which we must be saved.
   O God, Thou knowest my foolishness,
   and my sins are not hid from Thee.
   Lord, Thou knowest all my desire,
   and my groaning is not hid from Thee.
   Let not them that trust in Thee,
   O Lord God of hosts,
   be ashamed for my cause;
   let not those that seek Thee be
   confounded through me,
   O Lord God of Israel.
   Take me out of the mire that I sink not;
   O let me, be delivered from them
   that hate me
   and out of the deep waters;
   Let not the water flood drown me,
   neither let the deep swallow me up,
   and let not the pit shut her mouth
   upon me.

  PRAYER FOR GRACE

   [Defend me from]
   [against seven deadly sins]
   Pride                 Amorite.
   envy                  Hittite.
   wrath                 Perizzite.

   [Give me]
   Humility, pitifulness, patience,
   sobriety, purity, contentment, ready zeal.

   One thing have I desired of the Lord
   which I will require, [12]
   that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
   all the days of my life,
   to behold the fair beauty of the Lord,
   and to visit His temple.
   Two things have I required of Thee,
   O Lord,
   deny Thou me not before I die;
   remove far from me vanity and lies;
   give me neither poverty nor riches,
   feed me with food convenient for me;
   lest I be full and deny Thee
   and say, Who is the Lord?
   or lest I be poor and steal,
   and take the Name of my God in vain.
   Let me learn to abound,
   let me learn to suffer need,
   in whatsoever state I am,
   therewith to be content.
   For nothing earthly, temporal, mortal,
   to long nor to wait.
   Grant me a happy life
   in piety, gravity, purity,
   in all things good and fair,
   in cheerfulness, in health, in credit,
   in competency, in safety, in gentle estate,
   in quiet;
   a happy death,
   a deathless happiness.

  INTERCESSION

   And I have hoped in Thy mercy
   from?everlasting to everlasting.
   How excellent is Thy mercy, O Lord;
   If I have hope, it is in Thy mercy,
   O let me not be disappointed of my hope.
   Moreover we beseech Thee,
   remember all, Lord, for good;
   have pity upon all; O Sovereign Lord,
   be reconciled with us all.
   Give peace to the multitudes of Thy
   people;
   scatter offences;
   abolish wars;

   Thy peace and love
   vouchsafe to us, O God our Saviour,
   the Hope of all the ends of the
   earth.
   Remember to crown the year
   with Thy goodness;
   for the eyes of all wait upon Thee,
   and Thou givest them their meat in due
   season.
   Thou openest Thy hand,
   and fillest all things living
   with plenteousness.
   Remember Thy Holy Church;.
   from one end of the earth to the other;
   and give her peace,
   whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy
   precious blood;
   and establish her
   unto the end of the world.
   Remember those who bear fruit,
   and act nobly,
   in Thy holy Churches,
   and who remember the poor and needy;
   recompense to them
   Thy rich and heavenly gifts;
   vouchsafe to them,
   for things earthly, heavenly,
   for corruptible, incorruptible,
   for temporal, eternal.
   Remember those who are in virginity;
   and purity and ascetic life;
   also those who live in honourable
   marriage,

   deliverance to the captives.
   Remember religious and faithful kings,

   our divinely?guarded king;

   for Thy Church, and all Thy
   people.
   Vouchsafe to him deep and undisturbed
   peace,
   that in his serenity
   we may lead a quiet and peaceable life
   with all godliness and honesty.
   Remember, Lord, all power
   and authority,
   our brethren in the court,
   those who are chief in council
   and judgment,
   and all by land and sea
   waging Thy wars for us.
   Moreover, Lord, remember graciously
   our holy Fathers,

   and all the Clergy,
   rightly dividing the Word of Truth,
   and rightly walking in it.
   Remember, Lord, our brethren
   around us,

   in galleys,
   in whatever affliction, necessity,
   and emergence,
   remember, O God;
   and all who need Thy great mercy;
   and those who love us,
   and those who hate;
   and those who have desired us unworthy
   to make mention of them in our prayers;
   and all Thy people remember, O Lord,
   our God,
   and upon all pour out Thy rich pity,
   to all performing their requests
   for salvation;
   and those of whom we have not made
   mention,
   through ignorance, forgetfulness,
   or number of names,
   do Thou Thyself remember, O God,
   who knowest the stature and appellation
   of each,
   who knowest every one from his mother's
   womb.
   For Thou art, O Lord, the Succour of the
   succourless,
   the Hope of the hopeless,
   The Saviour of the tempest?tost,
   the Harbour of the voyager,
   the Physician of the sick,
   do Thou Thyself become all things

   petition,
   each house, and its need,
   deliver, O Lord, this city,
   and all the country in which we sojourn,
   from plague, famine, earthquake, flood,
   fire, sword, hostile invasion,
   and civil war.
   End the schisms of the Churches,
   quench the haughty cries of the nations,
   and receive us all into Thy kingdom,
   acknowledging us, as sons of light;
   and Thy peace and love
   vouchsafe to us, O Lord, our God.
   Remember O Lord, our God,
   all spirits and all flesh
   which we have remembered, and which
   we have not.
   And the close of our life,
   Lord, Lord, direct in peace,
   Christianly, acceptably, and, should it
   please Thee, painlessly,
   gathering us together under the feet
   of Thine elect,
   when Thou wilt and how Thou wilt,
   only without shame and sins.
   The brightness of the Lord our God be
   upon us,
   prosper Thou the work of our hands
   upon us,
   O prosper Thou our handiwork.
   Be, Lord,
   within me to strengthen me,
   without me to guard me,
   over me to shelter me,
   beneath me to stablish me,
   before me to guide me,
   after me to forward me,
   round about me to secure me.

  PRAISE

   Blessed art Thou, Lord, God of Israel,
   our Father,
   from everlasting to everlasting.
   Thine, O Lord,
   is the greatness and the power,
   the triumph and the victory,
   the praise and the strength,
   for Thou rulest over all
   in heaven and on earth.
   At Thy face every king is troubled,
   and every nation.
   Thine, O Lord, is the kingdom
   and the supremacy over all,
   and over all rule.
   With Thee is wealth, and glory is from
   Thy countenance;
   Thou rulest over all, O Lord;
   the Ruler of all rule;
   and in Thine hand is strength
   and power,
   and in Thine hand to give to all things
   greatness and strength.
   And now; Lord, we confess to Thee
   and we praise Thy glorious Name.

THE FIFTH DAY
     __________________________________________________________________

  INTRODUCTION

   We are satisfied with Thy mercy,
   O Lord,
   in the morning.
   Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
   who broughtest forth from the water
   creeping things of life,
   and whales,
   and winged fowl.

   Be Thou exalted, O God,
   above the heavens,
   and Thy glory above all the earth.
   By Thy Ascension, O Lord,
   draw us too after Thee,
   that we savour of what is above,
   not of things on the earth.

   By the marvellous mystery
   of the Holy Body and precious Blood,
   on the evening of this day,
   Lord, have mercy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CONFESSION

   Thou who hast said,
   "As I live, saith the Lord,
   I will not the death of a sinner,
   but that the ungodly return from his way
   and live;
   turn ye, turn ye from your wicked way,
   for why will ye die, O house of
   Israel?"
   turn us, O Lord, to Thee,
   and so shall we be turned.
   Turn us from all our ungodlinesses,
   and let them not be to us
   for punishments.
   I have sinned, I have committed iniquity,
   I have done wickedly,
   from Thy precepts, and Thy judgments.
   To Thee, O Lord, righteousness,
   and to me confusion of face,
   as at this day,
   in our dispicableness,
   wherewith Thou hast despised us.
   Lord, to us confusion of face,
   and to our rulers
   who have sinned against Thee.
   Lord, in all things is Thy righteousness,
   unto all Thy righteousness;
   let then Thine anger and Thy fury be
   turned away,
   and cause Thy face to shine
   upon Thy servant.
   O my God, incline Thine ear and hear,
   open Thine eyes and see my
   desolation.
   O Lord, hear, O Lord forgive,
   O Lord hearken and do;
   defer not for Thine own sake,
   O my God,
   for Thy servant is called by Thy Name.
   In many things we offend all;
   Lord, let Thy mercy rejoice, against Thy
   judgment in my sins.
   If I say I have no sin, I deceive myself,
   and the truth is not in me;
   but I confess my sins many and grievous,
   and Thou, O Lord, art faithful and just,
   to forgive me my sins when I confess
   them.
   Yea, for this too
   I have an Advocate with Thee to Thee,
   Thy Only?begotten Son, the Righteous.
   May He be the propitiation for my sins,
   who is also for the whole world.
   Will the Lord cast off for ever?
   and will He be no more intreated?
   Is His mercy clean gone for ever?
   and is His promise come utterly to an end
   for evermore?
   Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
   and will He shut up His loving kindness
   in displeasure?
   And I said, It is mine own infirmity;
   but I will remember the years of the
   right hand of the most Highest.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PRAYER FOR GRACE

   [Give me grace]
   to put aside every weight,
   and the sin that doth so easily beset us;
   all filthiness
   and superfluity of naughtiness,
   lust?of the flesh, of the eyes,
   pride of life,
   every motion, of flesh and spirit
   alienated from the will of Thy sanctity:
   to be poor in spirit,
   that I have a portion in the kingdom of
   heaven;
   to mourn, that I be comforted;
   to be meek, that I inherit the earth;
   to hunger and thirst for righteousness,
   that I be filled;
   to be pitiful, that I be pitied;
   to be pure in heart, that I see God;
   to be a peace?maker that I be called the
   son of God;
   to be prepared for persecutions and
   revilings for righteousness' sake,
   that my reward be in heaven,--
   all this, grant to me, O Lord.

   that He is Christ, the Son of the Living
   God,
   that He is truly the Saviour of the world,
   that He came into the world to save
   sinners,
   of whom I am chief.
   Through the grace of Jesus Christ
   we believe that we shall be saved
   like as our fathers.
   I know that my skin shall rise up upon
   the earth,
   which undergoeth these things.
   I believe, to see the goodness of the Lord
   in the land of the living.
   Our heart shall rejoice in Him,
   because we have hoped in His holy
   Name,
   in the Name of the Father,
   of the Saviour, Mediator, Intercessor,
   Redeemer,
   of the two?fold Comforter,
   under the figures of the Lamb and the
   Dove.
   Let Thy merciful kindness, O Lord,
   be upon us,
   like as we do put our trust in Thee.

THE SIXTH DAY
     __________________________________________________________________

  INTRODUCTION

   EARLY shall my prayer come before
   Thee.
   Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
   who broughtest forth of the earth,
   wild beasts, cattle,
   and all the reptiles,
   for food, clothing, help;
   and madest man after Thine image,
   to rule the earth,
   and blessedst him,
   The fore?counsel, fashioning hand,
   breath of life, image of God,
   appointment over the works,
   charge to the Angels concerning him,
   paradise.--
   Heart, reins, eyes, ears, tongue, hands,
   feet,
   life, sense, reason, spirit, free will,
   memory, conscience,
   the revelation of God, writing of the
   law,
   oracles of prophets, music of psalms,
   instruction of proverbs,
   experience of histories,
   worship of sacrifices.

   Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
   for Thy great and precious promise
   on this day,
   concerning the Life?giving Seed,
   and for its fulfilment in fulness of
   the times
   on this day.

   Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
   for the holy Passion
   of this day.
   O by Thy salutary sufferings
   on this day,
   save us, O Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CONFESSION

   I have withstood Thee, Lord,
   but I return to Thee;
   for I have fallen by mine iniquity.
   But I take with me words,
   and I return unto Thee and say,
   take away all iniquity and receive us
   graciously,
   so will we render the calves of our lips.
   Spare us, Lord, spare,
   and give not Thine heritage to reproach,
   to Thine enemies.

   Lord, Lord, be propitious,
   cease, I beseech Thee,
   by whom shall Jacob arise?
   for he is small.
   Repent, O Lord, for this,
   and this shall not be.

   While observing lying vanities
   I forsook my own mercy,
   and am cast out of Thy sight.
   When my soul fainted within me,
   I remembered the Lord;
   yet will I look again toward Thy Holy
   Temple;
   Thou hast brought up my life from
   corruption.

   Who is a God like unto Thee,
   that pardoneth iniquity
   to the remnant of His heritage?
   He retaineth not His anger forever,
   because He delighteth in mercy.
   Turn again and have compassion
   upon us, O Lord,
   subdue our iniquities,
   and cast all our sins into the depths
   of the sea,
   according to Thy truth,
   and according to Thy mercy.

   O Lord, I have heard Thy speech
   and was afraid,
   in wrath remember mercy.
   Behold me, Lord, clothed in filthy
   garments;
   behold Satan standing at my right hand;
   yet, O Lord,
   by the blood of Thy covenant,
   by the fountain opened for sin and for
   uncleanness,
   Take away my iniquity,
   and cleanse me from my sin.
   Save me as a brand
   plucked out of the fire.
   Father, forgive me, for I knew not,
   truly I knew not, what I did
   in sinning against Thee.
   Lord, remember me
   when Thou comest in Thy kingdom.
   Lord, lay not mine enemies' sins to
   their charge,
   Lord, lay not my own to mine.
   By Thy sweat bloody and clotted,
   Thy soul in agony,
   Thy head crowned with thorns,
   bruised with staves,
   Thine eyes swimming with tears,
   Thine ears full of insults,
   Thy mouth moistened with vinegar
   and gall,
   Thy face dishonourably stained with
   spitting,
   Thy neck weighed down with the burden
   Thy back ploughed with the wheals
   and gashes of the scourge,
   Thy hands and feet stabbed through,
   Thy strong cry, Eli, Eli,
   Thy heart pierced with the spear,
   the water and blood thence flowing,
   Thy body broken,
   Thy blood poured out,
   Lord, forgive the offence of Thy servant,
   and cover all his sins.
   Turn away all Thy displeasure,
   and turn Thyself from Thy wrathful
   indignation.
   Turn me then, O God our Saviour,
   and let Thine anger cease from us.
   Wilt Thou be displeased at us for ever,
   and stretch out Thy wrath from one
   generation to another?
   Wilt Thou not turn again
   and quicken us,
   that Thy people may rejoice in Thee?
   Shew us Thy mercy, O Lord,
   and grant us Thy salvation

  PRAISE

   Thou who, on man's transgressing Thy
   command, and falling,
   didst not pass him by, nor leave him,
   God of goodness;
   but didst visit in ways manifold,
   as a tender Father,
   supplying him with Thy great and
   precious promise,
   concerning the Life?giving Seed,
   opening to him the door of faith,
   and of repentance unto life,
   and in fulness of the times,
   sending Thy Christ Himself
   to take on Him the seed of Abraham;
   and, in the oblation of His life,
   to fulfil the Law's obedience;
   and, in the sacrifice of His death,
   to take off the Law's curse;
   and, in His death,
   to redeem the world;
   and, in His resurrection,
   to quicken it:--
   O Thou, who doest all things,
   whereby to bring again our race to Thee,
   that it may be partaker
   of Thy divine nature and eternal glory;
   who hast borne witness
   to the truth of Thy gospel
   by many and various wonders,
   in the ever-memorable converse of Thy
   saints,
   in their supernatural endurance
   of torments;
   in the overwhelming conversion
   of all lands
   to the obedience of faith,
   without might, or persuasion; or
   compulsion:--
   Blessed be Thy Name,
   and praised and celebrated,
   and magnified, and high exalted,

THE SEVENTH DAY
     __________________________________________________________________

  INTRODUCTION

   O LORD, be gracious unto us,
   we have waited for Thee;
   be Thou our arm every morning,
   our salvation also in the time of trouble.
   Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
   who restedst on the seventh day
   from all Thy works,
   and blessedst and sanctifiedst it:
   [concerning the Sabbath,
   concerning the Christian rest instead
   of it,
   concerning the burial of Christ,
   and the resting from sin,
   concerning those who are already gone
   to rest.]
     __________________________________________________________________

  CONFESSION

   I am ashamed; and blush, O my God,
   to lift up my face to Thee,
   for mine iniquities are increased
   over my head,
   and my trespass is grown up unto the
   heavens;
   since the days of youth
   have I been in a great trespass
   unto this day;
   I cannot stand before Thee because
   of this.
   My sins are more in number than the
   sand of the sea,
   my iniquities are multiplied,
   and I not worthy to look up
   and see the height of heaven,
   from the number of my
   unrighteousnesses;
   and I have no relief,
   because I have provoked Thine anger,
   and done evil in Thy sight;
   not doing Thy will,
   not keeping Thy commandments.
   And now my heart kneels to Thee,
   beseeching Thy goodness.
   I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned,
   and I know mine iniquities;
   and I ask and beseech,
   remit to me, O Lord, remit to me,
   and destroy me not in mine iniquities;
   nor be Thou angry for ever,
   nor reserve evil for me;
   nor condemn me
   in the lowest parts of the earth.
   Because Thou art God,
   the God of penitents,
   and Thou shalt shew in me all Thy
   loving kindness;
   for Thou shalt save me unworthy,
   according to Thy much pity,
   and I will praise Thee alway.
   Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst cleanse
   me;
   Lord, only say the word, and I shall be
   healed.
   Lord, save me;
   Carest Thou not that we perish?
   Say to me, Be of good cheer, thy sins
   are remitted to thee.
   Jesu, Master, have mercy on me;
   Thou Son of David, Jesu, have mercy
   on me;
   Jesu, Son of David, Son of David.
   Lord, say to me, Ephphatha.
   Lord, I have no man (John v. 7);
   Lord, say to me, Be loosed from thine
   infirmity.
   Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
   Say unto me, My grace is sufficient
   for thee.
   Lord, how long wilt Thou be angry?
   shall Thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
   O, remember not our old sins;
   but have mercy on us and that soon,
   for we are come to great misery;
   Help us, O God of our salvation;
   for the glory of Thy Name.
   O deliver us and be merciful unto
   our sins,
   for Thy Name's sake.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PRAYER FOR GRACE

   all my failings, shortcomings, falls,
   offences, trespasses, scandals,

   The guilt of them,
   be gracious unto,   pardon;
   remit,              forgive;
   be propitious unto, spare;
   impute not,         charge not, remember not.
   The stain,
   pass by,            pass over;
   disregard,          overlook;
   hide,               wash away;
   blot out,           cleanse.

   The hurt,
   remit,    heal,   remedy;
   take off, remove, away with;
   abolish,  annul,  disperse, annihilate;
   that they be not found, that they exist not.

   Supply
   to faith,          virtue;
   to virtue,         knowledge
   to knowledge,      continence;
   to continence,     patience;
   to patience,       godliness;
   to godliness,      brotherly love;
   to brotherly love, charity.

   That I forget not my cleansing from my
   former sins,
   but give diligence to make my calling
   and election sure
   through good works.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PROFESSION

   I believe in Thee the Father;
   Behold then, if Thou art a Father and
   we sons,
   as a father pitieth sons,
   be Thou of tender?mercy towards us,
   O Lord.
   I believe in Thee, the Lord;
   behold then, if Thou art Lord and we
   servants,
   our eyes are upon Thee our Lord,
   until Thou have mercy upon us.
   I believe that though we be neither sons
   nor servants,
   but dogs only,
   yet we have leave to eat of the crumbs
   that fall from Thy Table.
   I believe that Christ is the Lamb of
   God;
   O Lamb of God that takest away the
   sins of the world,
   take Thou away mine.
   I believe that Jesus Christ came into
   the world
   to save sinners;
   Thou who camest to save sinners
   save Thou me, of sinners
   chief and greatest,
   I believe that Christ came to save what
   was lost;
   Thou who camest to save the lost,
   never suffer, O Lord, that to be lost
   which Thou hast saved.
   I believe that the Spirit is the Lord and
   Giver of life;
   Thou who gavest me a living soul,
   give me that I receive not my soul
   in vain.
   I believe that the Spirit gives grace
   in His sacred things;
   give me that I receive not His grace
   in vain,
   nor hope of His sacred things.
   I believe that the Spirit intercedes for us
   with plaints unutterable
   grant me of His intercession and those
   plaints
   to partake, O Lord.
   Our fathers hoped in Thee,
   they trusted in Thee, and Thou didst
   deliver them.
   They called upon Thee and were holpen,
   they put their trust in Thee, and were not
   confounded.
   As Thou didst our fathers
   in the generations of old,
   so also deliver us, O Lord,
   who trust in Thee.

   and God Himself shall be with them,
   and shall wipe away all tears from
   their eyes.
   And there shall be no more death;
   neither crying, neither pain any more,
   for the former things are passed away.

   LORD, Thou knowest, and canst,

   the good, of my soul.
   Miserable man am I;

   and, among Thy people, Thy servant,
   who is redeemed with Thy precious
   blood;
   and be not angry with us for ever.
   Be merciful; be merciful; spare us, Lord,
   and be not angry with us for ever.
   Be merciful; be merciful;
   have pity on us, Lord,
   and be not angry with us to the full.
   Deal not, O Lord,
   deal not with me after mine inquities .
   neither recompense me according to my
   sins;
   but after Thy great pity,
   deal with me;
   and according to the multitude of Thy
   mercies,
   recompense me;
   after that so great pity,
   and that multitude of mercies,
   as Thou didst to our fathers
   in the times of old;--
   by all that is dear unto Thee.
   From all evil and adversity,
   in all time of need;
   from this evil and this adversity,
   in this time;
   raise me, rescue me, save me,
   O Lord.
   Deliver me, O Lord,
   and destroy me not.
   On the bed of sickness;
   in the hour of death;
   in the day of judgment,
   in that dreadful and fearful day;
   rescue me, Lord, and save me;--
   from seeing the judge's face overcast,
   from being placed on the left,
   from hearing the dreadful word,
   Depart from Me,
   from being bound in chains of darkness,
   from being, east into the outer darkness,
   from being tormented in the pit of fire
   and brimstone,
   where the smoke of the torments
   ascendeth for ever.
   Be merciful, be merciful,
   spare us, pity us,
   O Lord:
   and destroy us not for ever,
   deliver and save us.
   Let it not be, O Lord; and that it
   be not,
   take away from me, O Lord,
   hardness of heart,
   desperateness after sinning,
   blindness of heart,
   contempt of Thy threats,
   a cauterized conscience,
   a reprobate mind,
   the sin against the Holy Ghost,
   the sin unto death,
   the four crying sins; [16]
   the six which forerun [17]
   the sin against, the Holy Ghost.
   Deliver me
   from all ills and abominations of this
   world,
   from plague, famine, and war;
   earthquake, flood, and fire,
   the stroke of immoderate rain and
   drought;
   blast and blight;
   thunder, lightning and tempest;
   epidemic sickness, acute and malignant,
   unexpected death;
   from ills and difficulties in the Church,
   from private interpretation,
   from innovation in things sacred,
   from heterodox teaching;
   from unhealthy enquiries and
   interminable disputes,
   from heresies, schisms; scandals,
   public and private,
   from making gods of kings,
   from flattering of the people,
   from the indifference of Saul,
   from tie scorn of Michal,
   from the greediness of Hophni,
   from the plunder of Athaliah;
   from the priesthood of Micah,
   from the brotherhood of Simon and
   Judas,
   from the doctrine of men unlearned
   and unestablished,
   from the pride of novices,
   from the people resisting
   the priest:--
   from ills and difficulties in the
   state, from anarchy, many rulers, tyranny,
   from Asher, Jeroboam, Rehoboam,
   Gallio, Haman,
   the profligacy of Ahithophel,
   the foolishness of Zoan (Isa. xix.),
   the statutes of Omri,
   the justice of Jezebel,

   governors;

   in sin, shame, tortures,
   desperateness, defilement, violence,
   treachery;
   from death unexpected,
   from death eternal.

     __________________________________________________________________

ON CHRISTIAN DUTY

   WHAT shall I do that I may inherit eternal life

   Keep the commandments. (Mark x. 17.)

   What shall we do?

   Repent and be baptized every one of you (Acts ii, 37, 38)

   What must I do to be saved?

   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. (Acts xvi. 31.)

   What shall we do then?

   [To the multitude]

   He who hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none.

   He that hath meat let him do likewise.

   [To the publicans]

   Exact no more than is appointed you.

   [To soldiers.]

   Do violence to no man; neither accuse any falsely; be content with your
   wages. (Luke iii. 10-14.)

   The knowledge and faith
   of [God's] justice [God's] mercy,
   [leads] unto
   fear,              hope,
   abasement,         consolation,
   repentance,        thanksgiving,
   fasting,           almsgiving,
   prayers,           hymns,
   patience,          obedience,
   a sacrifice.       an oblation.
     __________________________________________________________________

ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT

   Father Unoriginate, Only?begotten Son,
   Life?giving Spirit,.
   merciful, pitiful, long?suffering,
   full of pity, full of kind yearnings,
   who lowest the just and pitiest the
   sinful,
   who passest by sins and grantest
   petitions,
   God of penitents,
   Saviour of sinners,
   I have sinned before Thee; O Lord,
   and thus and thus have I done.
   Alas, alas! woe, woe.
   How was I enticed by my own
   lust!
   How I hated instruction!
   Nor felt I fear nor shame
   at Thy incomprehensible glory,
   Thy awful presence,
   Thy fearful power,
   Thy exact justice,
   Thy winning goodness.
   I will call if there be any that will
   answer me;
   to which of the saints shall I turn?
   O wretched man that I am,
   who shall deliver me from the body of
   this death
   how fearful is Thy judgment,
   O Lord?
   when the thrones are set
   and Angels stand around,
   aid men are brought in,
   the books opened,
   the works enquired into,
   the thoughts examined,
   and the hidden things of darkness.
   What judgment shall be upon me?
   who shall quench my flame?
   who shall lighten my darkness,
   if Thou pity me not?
   Lord, as Thou art loving,
   give me tears,
   give me floods, give me to?day.
   For then will be the incorruptible Judge,
   the horrible judgment?seat,
   the answer without excuses,
   the inevitable charges,
   the shameful punishment,
   the endless Gehenna,
   the pitiless Angels,
   the yawning hell,
   the roaring stream of fire,
   the unquenchable flame,
   the dark prison,
   the rayless darkness,
   the bed of live coals,
   the unwearied worm,
   the indissoluble chains,
   the bottomless chaos,
   the impassable wall;
   the inconsolable cry,
   none to stand by me,
   none to plead for me,
   none to snatch me out.
   But I repent, Lord, O Lord,
   I repent,
   help Thou mine impenitence,
   and more, and still more,
   pierce, rend, crush my heart.
   Behold, O Lord, that I am
   indignant with myself,
   for my senseless; profitless,
   hurtful, perilous passions;
   that I loathe myself,
   for these inordinate, unseemly,
   deformed, insincere,
   shameful, disgraceful
   passions,
   that my confusion is daily before me,
   and the shame of my face hath covered
   me.
   Alas! woe, woe--
   O me, how long?
   Behold, Lord, that I sentence myself
   to punishment everlasting,
   yea, and all miseries of this world.
   Behold me, Lord, self?condemned;
   Behold, Lord, and enter not into
   judgment
   with Thy servant.
   And now, Lord,
   I humble myself under Thy mighty hand,
   I bend to Thee, O Lord, my knees,
   I fall on my face to the earth.
   Let this cup pass from me!
   I stretch forth my hands unto Thee;
   I smite my breast, I smite on my thigh.
   Out of the deep my soul crieth unto
   Thee,
   as a thirsty land;
   and all my bones,
   and all that is within me.
   Lord; hear my voice.
     __________________________________________________________________

ON HUMAN FRAILNESS

   Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am weak;
   remember, Lord, how short my time is;
   remember that I am but flesh,
   a wind that passeth away, and cometh
   not again.
   My days are as grass, as a flower of the
   field;
   for the wind goeth over me, and I am
   gone,
   and my place shall knave me no more.
   I am dust and ashes,
   earth and grass,
   flesh and breath,
   corruption and the worm,
   a stranger upon the earth,
   dwelling in a house of clay,
   few and evil my days,
   to?day, and not to?morrow,
   in the morning, yet not until night,
   in a body of sin,
   in a world of corruption,
   of few days, and full of trouble,
   coming up, and cut down like a flower,
   and as a shadow, having no stay.
   Remember this, O Lord, and suffer,
   remit;
   what profit is there in my blood,
   when I go down to the pit?
   By the multitude of Thy mercies,
   by the riches and excessive redundance
   of Thy pity;
   by all that is dear to Thee,
   all that we should plead,
   and before and beyond all things, by
   Thyself,
   by Thyself; O Lord, and by Thy Christ.
   Lord, have mercy upon me, the chief of
   sinners.
   O my Lord, let Thy mercy rejoice
   against Thy judgment in my sin.
   O Lord, hear, O Lord, forgive,
   O Lord, hearken,
   O Lord, hearken and do,
   do and defer not for Thine own sake,
   defer not; O Lord my God.

                               FOR HOLY COMMUNION

   O LORD, I am not worthy, I am not
   fit,
   that Thou shouldest come under the roof
   of my soul;
   for it is all desolate and ruined;
   nor hast Thou in me fitting place
   to lay Thy head.
   But, as Thou didst vouchsafe
   to lie in the cavern and manger of brute
   cattle,
   as Thou didst not disdain
   to be entertained in the house of Simon
   the leper;
   as Thou didst not disdain
   that harlot, like me, who was a
   sinner,
   coming to Thee: and touching Thee;
   as Thou abhorredst not
   her polluted and loathsome mouth;
   nor the thief upon the cross
   confessing Thee:
   So me too the ruined, wretched,
   and excessive sinner,
   deign to receive to the touch and
   partaking
   of the immaculate, supernatural,
   lifegiving,
   and saving mysteries
   of Thy all?holy Body
   and Thy precious Blood.
   Listen, O Lord, our God,
   from Thy holy habitation,
   and from the glorious throne of Thy
   kingdom,
   and come to sanctify us.
   O Thou who sittest on high with the
   Father,
   and art present with us here invisibly;
   come Thou to sanctify the gifts which
   lie before Thee,
   and those in whose behalf, and by
   whom,
   and the things for which,
   they are brought near Thee.
   And grant to us communion,
   unto faith, without shame,
   love without: dissimulation,
   fulfilment of Thy commandments,
   alacrity for every spiritual fruit;
   hindrance of all adversity,
   healing of soul and body;
   that we too, with all Saints,
   who have been well?pleasing to Thee
   from the beginning,
   may become partakers
   of Thy incorrupt and everlasting goods,
   which Thou hast prepared, O Lord, for
   them that love Thee;
   in whom Thou art glorified
   for ever and ever.
   Lamb of God,
   that takest away the sin of the world,
   take away the sin of me,
   the utter sinner.

   We then remembering, O sovereign
   Lord,
   in the presence of Thy holy mysteries,
   the salutary passion of Thy Christ,
   His life?giving cross,
   most precious death,
   three days' sepulture,
   resurrection from the dead,
   ascent into heaven,
   session at the right hand of Thee,
   the Father,
   His fearful and glorious coming;
   we beseech Thee, O Lord,
   that we, receiving in the pure testimony
   of our conscience,
   our portion of Thy sacred things,
   may be made one with the holy Body
   and Blood
   of Thy Christ;
   and receiving them not unworthily,
   we may hold Christ indwelling in our
   hearts,
   and may become a temple
   of Thy Holy Spirit.
   Yea, O our God,
   nor make any of us guilty
   of Thy dreadful and heavenly mysteries,
   nor infirm in soul or body
   from partaking of them unworthily.
   But grant us
   until our last and closing breath
   worthily to receive a hope of Thy holy
   things,
   for sanctification, enlightening,
   strengthening,
   a relief of the weight of my many sins,
   a preservative against all satanic
   working,
   a riddance and hindrance of my evil
   conscience,
   a mortification of my passions,
   an appropriation of Thy commandments,
   an increase of Thy divine grace;
   and a securing of Thy kingdom.

   * * * * *

   It is finished and done,
   so far as in our power,
   Christ our God,
   the mystery of Thy dispensation.
   For we have held remembrance of Thy
   death,
   we have seen the figure of Thy
   resurrection,
   we have been filled with Thy endless
   life,
   we have enjoyed Thy uncloying dainties,
   which graciously vouchsafe all of us,
   in the world to come.
   Lord, the good God,
   pardon every soul,
   that purifieth his heart to seek God,
   the Lord God of His fathers,
   though he be not cleansed
   according to the purification of the
   sanctuary.
