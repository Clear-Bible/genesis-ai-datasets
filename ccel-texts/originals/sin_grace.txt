   A treatise

   of

   the dominion of sin and grace;

   wherein sin's reign is discovered, in whom it is, and in whom it is
   not; how the law supports it; how grace delivers from it, by setting up
   its dominion in the heart.

Prefatory note.

   It appears that the following treatise was published by the widow of
   Owen, five years after his death; and we learn, from the preface which
   Isaac Chauncy prefixed to it, that the author had left it ready for the
   press. The most important part of it relates to the evidence by which
   we ascertain whether or not sin holds dominion over the heart. In the
   description and sifting of this evidence, the author manifests all his
   singular powers of spiritual analysis and discrimination.

   We have had access to a manuscript which belonged to Dr Owen's friend,
   Sir John Hartopp, and which contains a large portion of this treatise.
   It serves to show how many obscure passages in the writings of Owen
   might have been elucidated and rendered perfectly clear, if the same
   advantage had been enjoyed in the preparation of his other works for
   this edition. The following are some instances of important corrections
   made on the text, as it stood in all previous editions, by the aid of
   this manuscript. On its authority we have altered "disavow" into
   "avow;" "it is that act by which the mind loads itself," into "it is
   that art by which the mind leads itself;" "mind" into "wind;" "sin hath
   not the dominion," into "sin hath the dominion," the sense of the
   passage, as is evident from the context, having been spoiled by the
   insertion of the negative; "invisible" into "irresistible;" "affairs"
   into "affections," etc.

  Analysis.

   The treatise is founded on Rom. vi. 14, and three facts are presupposed
   in the discussion that follows:-- that sin dwells in believers; seeks
   to renew its dominion over them; and endeavours to accomplish this
   object by deceit and force, chap. i.

   Three leading inquiries are proposed:-- I. Into the nature of this
   dominion; II. The evidence by which we ascertain whether it exists in
   us; and III. The reason or ground of the assurance that it shall not
   have dominion over believers.

   I. As to the nature of this dominion, -- 1. It is evil and perverse,
   (1.) as usurped, and (2.) as exercised to evil ends. 2. It implies no
   force contrary to the human will. 3. It implies that the soul is not
   under the influence of grace to any extent; and, 4. that it is sensible
   of the power of sin, ii.

   II. As to the evidence of this dominion, -- 1. Some features of
   character are specified which, though seemingly, are not really
   inconsistent with the dominion of sin. 2. Certain things are mentioned
   which leave the case doubtful; as when sin takes hold of the
   imagination, when it prevails in the affections, when there is a
   neglect of the means by which it is mortified, when a reservation is
   made in favour of any known sin, and when hardness of heart is
   manifested, iii. Hardness of heart is specially considered, and
   distinguished into natural, judicial, and partial or comparative; under
   the head of partial hardness, there are mentioned, -- (1.) Symptoms
   which, however evil in themselves, are not inconsistent with the
   existence of grace in the heart; and (2.) Symptoms which are hardly
   compatible with the reign of grace. And, 3. Incontestable evidences
   that sin has dominion over the soul are briefly mentioned, iv.

   III. The reason of the assurance that sin shall have no more dominion
   over believers is, that they are "not under the law, but under grace;"
   because, -- whereas, 1. the law gives no strength against sin, 2.
   confers no spiritual liberty, and, 3. supplies no motives to destroy
   the power of sin, and, 4. whereas Christ is not in the law, -- grace
   imparts these blessings, and thus enables us to subdue sin, v. Two
   practical observations are enforced, -- 1. The privilege of deliverance
   from the dominion of sin; and, 2. The importance of securing ourselves
   against the dominion of sin, and not suffering it to remain long
   doubtful whether or not we are under it, vi. -- Ed.

To the serious reader.

   One of the great gospel inquiries that a Christian ought to be most
   critical and curious in resolving to himself, upon the most impartial
   examination of his own heart, concerning his spiritual state and
   standing in grace, is, whether he be in the faith or no: which doubt
   can be resolved but two ways; -- either by faith itself closing with
   its true objects as offered in the gospel in its direct act (and so it
   evidenceth itself, being the evidence of things not seen, as all the
   natural senses evidence themselves by their own acts upon their proper
   objects, -- for he that sees the sun hath argument enough to himself
   that he is not blind, but hath a seeing eye, and faith, therefore, is
   frequently represented to us by seeing, as John vi. 40, and elsewhere;
   -- which evidence is according to the degrees of faith, weaker or
   stronger, and hence carries lesser or greater assurances with it; but
   such as are of the highest and best nature, giving the greatest glory
   to the grace and truth of God, and the firmest stay to the soul in the
   greatest storms of temptation, being as an anchor fastened within the
   veil, sure and steadfast), or else additionally, that our joy may be
   full, and for farther confirmation, especially in such cases wherein
   our faith seems to fail us, and we are like Thomas, God hath, out of
   his abundant grace in the gospel, provided arguments for us to raise
   from spiritual sense to judge of our state and standing by. But this
   requires the teachings of the Spirit, and thence a spirit of
   discerning, experience of, and insight into, our own hearts and ways,
   with senses exercised by reason of use, that these grounds and
   arguments may be matter of comfort and establishment unto us.

   I call these latter evidences subordinate ones, and additional to that
   of faith, [and they are] of great use by way of establishment and
   confirmation unto believers, provided they be not abused to sole
   resting and reliance upon them, to the great prejudice of our life of
   faith: for we live by faith (so must all repenting sinners when they
   have attained to the highest pitch of holiness in this life), and not
   by sense, no, not even spiritual sense; it is a good handmaid to faith,
   but no good mistress to it.

   Moreover, trials of this nature are often of a marvellous awakening and
   convincing nature unto poor secure sinners, formal and hypocritical
   professors, for many of them hold true with great demonstration in the
   negative: 1 John iii. 14, "He that loveth not his brother abideth in
   death;" and verse 10, "In this the children of God are manifest, and
   the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of
   God, neither he that loveth not his brother." Now, these tests come
   upon an unregenerate man as clear and strong convictions of his undone
   estate, when, by gospel light shining into his dark heart, it evidently
   appears that there is a total absence of such eminent graces as are
   inseparable from a child of God. But when a poor, broken-hearted,
   self-condemning sinner comes to try himself by these tests, especially
   under great temptation, he chargeth all that he finds in himself for
   hypocrisy, formality, and sin, sits altogether in darkness in respect
   of these sparks of internal light, and is fain at last, when he hath
   broken all his flints and worn out all his steel in compassing himself
   about with sparks of his own kindling, to turn unto Christ by faith,
   "as a prisoner of hope," believing in hope against hope, and from him
   to fetch, by a direct act of faith, as from the Sun of righteousness,
   all his light of life and comfort; and then he will be able to light
   all his small tapers, yea, all inferior arguments of his good estate
   will flow in with much enlargement and increase of consolation, as
   streams of living water flowing forth of the fountain set open for sin
   and for uncleanness into the belly of the true believing sinner,
   receiving by faith of the fulness of Christ through the Spirit,
   abundantly supplying him with rivers of true, substantial, living
   graces and consolations, being filled with the fruits of righteousness,
   to the praise and glory of Christ.

   Now, among disquisitions of this latter nature and use this is none of
   the least, whether we are under the dominion of sin or no. Either we
   are or are not. If we are, our state is most certainly dangerous, for
   such are under the law, and the law hath concluded all under wrath. If
   we are not under sin's dominion, we are in a blessed and happy estate,
   being under grace. For these two dominions divide the world, and every
   son and daughter of Adam is under one or the other, and none can be
   under both at the same time. Now, our being under grace can be no way
   better evidenced than by our being in Christ by faith: for he that is
   so "is a new creature, is passed from death unto life," will still be
   mortifying sin, the strong man in sin's dominion being cast out; and
   therefore faith is said to be our "victory," through the supply of all
   grace received from Jesus Christ. Indeed it calls for no small
   spiritual skill and understanding to pass a right judgment in these
   matters. Undoubtedly many are deceived in taking wrong measures to
   search out these deep things of God, taking them to belong to the mere
   faculties and endowments of a natural man, not considering that they
   are of the Spirit's revelation only. And hence it is that many poor
   creatures in a bondage state under the law, and therefore under sin's
   dominion, do work like slaves in the dunghill of their own hearts to
   find out some natural religion or moral goodness in themselves to
   recommend them unto God. But such recommendation must be under the law,
   it cannot be under grace; and therefore such are under the dominion of
   sin infallibly, as the Israelites were, which "followed after the law
   of righteousness, but attained not to the law of righteousness.
   Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the
   works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling-stone," Rom. ix.
   31, 32. And it is greatly to be bewailed that many professors that sit
   under the means of grace are so tender of their secure and palliated
   consciences, that they cannot endure that the rays of true gospel light
   should shine directly into their hearts, being contented with a name
   only that they do live. They are loath to come to any narrow search or
   trial, lest they should be found out, and appear to themselves in their
   ugly shapes, whilst they are willing that all the world should have a
   good opinion of them; under which they cannot admit of any inward
   disturbances, but desire to sleep in a whole skin.

   Others there are, sincere, broken-hearted believers, [who,] scared at
   the rock of presumption on which they see so many professors wrecked
   daily, are apt to fall upon the other extreme, and too wrongfully, to
   free grace, condemn themselves as being under the dominion of sin; and
   therefore censure themselves to be under the law and wrath,
   notwithstanding all their seeming faith and holiness, calling that
   presumption, and this hypocrisy. Hence, returning to a kind of "spirit
   of bondage again to fear," their faith is shaken by prevailing
   unbelief, their peace is broken, and all gospel ordinances rendered
   ineffectual, as to their true ends, of profit, edification, and
   comfort. Hence, though they are truly under grace, they do not know, or
   rather, through temptation, will not acknowledge it; but "go mourning
   all the day long, because of the oppression of the enemy." But I
   beseech such a poor soul to consider a little, and not to "receive the
   grace of God in vain." Dost thou groan under the usurpation and
   oppression of remaining sin? And is this the dominion of it? is there
   no difference between sin's dominion and sin's tyranny and usurpation?
   Dominion is upon account of right of conquest or subjection. There is
   upon both that sin reigns in carnal and unregenerate men, who "yield
   their members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin;" but you
   reckon yourselves "dead unto sin," having no joy in its prevalency, but
   grief, being planted in this respect "in the likeness of Christ's
   death," who "died unto sin once, but dieth no more." Sin shall have no
   more dominion over him; "likewise reckon ye also yourselves dead indeed
   unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord;" -- that
   is, to be under grace, to put yourself freely and joyfully under the
   conduct and dominion of Jesus Christ, and to keep up a continual fight
   and opposition against the prevailing power of sin. Indeed, sin will
   often: as an outlying watchful enemy, make its assaults and incursions
   on the best of God's children, as it did on David, Hezekiah, Peter; and
   though it may make breaches upon them, it shall not have a dominion and
   set up a throne of iniquity in their hearts. Grace will beat out sin's
   throne; for indeed the words of this text, -- that is, the subject of
   the ensuing treatise, -- carry the force of a promise to the saints, to
   animate and encourage them to fight against sin under the banner of our
   Lord Jesus, the captain of our salvation, made perfect through
   sufferings: "For sin shall not have dominion," etc.

   In treating of which text, this late learned and reverend author hath
   acted the part of a good workman that rightly divided the word of God
   (as in all his other writings of the like nature), giving every one
   their portion as it belongs to them, with so much perspicuity and
   demonstration, that if, Christian reader, thou wilt afford a little
   time and pains to read, meditate, dilate, and digest well, the truths
   here laid before thee, through the blessing of the God of all grace,
   thou wilt find much satisfaction and real spiritual advantage unto thy
   soul, either to awaken and recover thee from under the dominion of sin
   (the dangerous and palpable symptoms thereof being here plainly made
   manifest), or else to discover thy happy estate in being taken from
   "under the law," and brought under the dominion of "grace," whereby
   thou mayst assume great encouragement to thyself to proceed more
   cheerfully in "running the race set before thee."

   It is enough to say that the author hath left his encomium firmly
   rooted in the minds of all pious and learned men that are acquainted
   with his writings, polemic or practical; yea, his renown will always be
   great in after generations among the churches of Christ, and all true
   lovers of the great truths of the gospel. And that he is the author of
   this small tract is sufficient to recommend it to thy most serious
   perusal; taking this assurance, that it was left (among other writings
   of great value) thus perfected for the press by his own hand, and is
   now by his worthy relict published for the benefit of others besides
   herself. I doubt not but thou wilt say that it will answer the several
   lines that have been drawn in thy heart by sin or grace, "as in water
   face answereth to face;" and that this may be the effect of thy perusal
   thereof, in order to thy spiritual and eternal welfare, is the hearty
   desire and prayer of thy unfeigned well-wisher,

   A treatise

   of

   the dominion of sin and grace.

   For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law,
   but under grace." Rom. vi. 14.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter I.

   What sin is consistent with the state of grace, and what not -- Sin's
   great design in all to obtain dominion: it hath it in unbelievers, and
   contends for it in believers -- The ways by which it acts.

   The psalmist, treating with God in prayer about sin, acknowledgeth that
   there are in all men unsearchable errors of life, beyond all human
   understanding or comprehension, with such daily sins of infirmity as
   stand in need of continual cleansing and pardon: Ps. xix. 12, "Who can
   understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults." But yet he
   supposeth that these things are consistent with a state of grace and
   acceptation with God. He had no thought of any absolute perfection in
   this life, of any such condition as should not stand in need of
   continual cleansing and pardon. Wherefore, there are or may be such
   sins in believers, yea, many of them, which yet, under a due
   application unto God for purifying and pardoning grace, shall neither
   deprive us of peace here nor endanger our salvation hereafter.

   But he speaks immediately of another sort of sins, which, partly from
   their nature, or what they are in themselves, and partly from their
   operation and power, will certainly prove destructive unto the souls of
   men wherever they are: Verse 13, "Keep back thy servant also from
   presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be
   upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression."

   This is the hinge whereon the whole cause and state of my soul doth
   turn: Although I am subject to many sins of various sorts, yet under
   them all I can and do maintain my integrity, and covenant uprightness
   in walking with God; and where I fail, am kept within the reach of
   cleansing and pardoning mercy, continually administered unto my soul by
   Jesus Christ: but there is a state of life in this world wherein sin
   hath dominion over the soul acting itself presumptuously, wherewith
   integrity and freedom from condemning guilt are inconsistent.

   This state, therefore, which alone is eternally ruinous unto the souls
   of men, he deprecates with all earnestness, praying to be kept and
   preserved from it.

   What he there so earnestly prays for, the apostle in the words of the
   text promiseth unto all believers, by virtue of the grace of Christ
   Jesus administered in the gospel. Both the prayer of the prophet for
   himself, and the promise of the apostle in the name of God unto us, do
   manifest of how great importance this matter is, as we shall declare it
   to be immediately.

   There are some things supposed or included in these words of the
   apostle. These we must first a little inquire into, without which we
   cannot well understand the truth itself proposed in them; as, --

   1. It is supposed that sin doth still abide in and dwell with
   believers; for so is the meaning of the words: "That sin which is in
   you shall not have dominion over you;" that is, none of them who are
   not sensible of it, who groan not to be delivered from it, as the
   apostle doth, Rom. vii. 24. Those who are otherwise minded know neither
   themselves, nor what sin is, nor wherein the grace of the gospel doth
   consist. There is the "flesh" remaining in every one, which "lusteth
   against the Spirit," Gal. v. 17; and it adheres unto all the faculties
   of our souls, whence it is called the "old man," Rom. vi. 6, in
   opposition unto the renovation of our minds and all the faculties of
   them, called the "new man," Eph. iv. 24, or "new creature" in us; and
   there is pronoia tes sarkos eis epithumias, Rom. xiii. 14, -- a
   continual working and provision to fulfil its own lusts: so that it
   abides in us in the way of a dying, decaying habit, weakened and
   impaired; but acting itself in inclinations, motions, and desires,
   suitable unto its nature.

   As Scripture and experience concur herein, so a supposition of it is
   the only ground of the whole doctrine of evangelical mortification.
   That this is a duty, a duty incumbent on believers all the days of
   their lives, such a duty as without which they can never perform any
   other in a due manner, will not be denied by any, but either such as
   are wholly under the power of atheistical blindness, or such as by the
   fever of spiritual pride have lost the understanding of their own
   miserable condition, and so lie dreaming about absolute perfection.
   With neither sort are we at present concerned. Now, the first proper
   object of this mortification is this sin that dwells in us. It is the
   "flesh" which is to be "mortified," the "old man" which is to be
   "crucified," the "lusts of the flesh," with all their corrupt
   inclinations, actings, and motions, that are to be destroyed, Col. iii.
   5; Rom. vi. 6; Gal. v. 24. Unless this be well fixed in the mind, we
   cannot understand the greatness of the grace and privilege here
   expressed.

   2. It is supposed that this sin, which, in the remainders of it, so
   abides in believers in various degrees, may put forth its power in them
   to obtain victory and dominion over them. It is first supposed that it
   hath this dominion in some, that it doth bear rule over all
   unbelievers, all that are under the law; and then that it will strive
   to do the same in them that believe and are under grace: for, affirming
   that it shall not have dominion over us, he grants that it may or doth
   contend for it, only it shall not have success, it shall not prevail.
   Hence it is said to fight and war in us, Rom. vii. 23, and to war
   against our souls, 1 Pet. ii. 11. Now, it thus fights, and wars, and
   contends in us for dominion, for that is the end of all war; whatever
   fights, it doth it for power and rule.

   This, therefore, is the general design of sin in all its actings. These
   actings are various, according to the variety of lusts in the minds of
   men; but its general design in them all is dominion. Where any one is
   tempted and seduced of his own lusts, as the apostle James speaks, be
   it in a matter never so small or so unusual, the temptation whereunto
   may never occur again, the design of sin lies not in the particular
   temptation, but to make it a means to obtain dominion over the soul.
   And the consideration hereof should keep believers always on their
   guard against all the motions of sin, though the matter of them seem
   but small, and the occasions of them such as are not like to return;
   for the aim and tendency of every one of them is dominion and death,
   which they will compass if not stopped in their progress, as the
   apostle there declares, James i. 14, 15. Believe not its flatteries:--
   "Is it not a little one?" "This is the first or shall be the last
   time;" "It requires only a little place in the mind and affections;"
   "It shall go no farther." Give not place to its urgency and
   solicitations; admit of none of its excuses or promises; it is power
   over your souls unto their ruin that it aims at in all.

   3. There are two ways whereby, in general, sin acts its power and aims
   at the obtaining this dominion, and they are the two only ways whereby
   any may design or attain an unjust dominion, and they are deceit and
   force, both of which I have fully described in another discourse; [2]
   with respect whereunto it is promised that the Lord Christ shall
   "deliver the souls of the poor that cry unto him from deceit and
   violence," Ps. lxxii. 12-14.

   These are the two only ways of obtaining an unjust dominion; and where
   they are in conjunction they must have a mighty prevalency, and such as
   will render the contest hazardous. There are few believers but have
   found it so, at least in their own apprehensions. They have been ready
   to say, at one time or another, "We shall one day fall by the hand of
   this enemy;" and have been forced to cry out unto Jesus Christ for help
   and succour, with no less vehemency than the disciples did at sea when
   the ship was covered with waves, "Lord, save us; we perish," Matt.
   viii. 24-26. And so they would do did he not come in seasonably to
   their succour, Heb. ii. 18. And herein the soul hath frequently no less
   experience of the power of Christ in his grace than the disciples on
   their outcry had of his sovereign authority, when "he rebuked the winds
   and the sea, and there was a great calm."

   This dominion of sin is that which we have here security given us
   against. Though it will abide in us, though it will contend for rule by
   deceit and force, yet it shall not prevail, it shall not have the
   dominion.

   And this is a case of the highest importance unto us. Our souls are,
   and must be, under the rule of some principle or law; and from this
   rule our state is determined and denominated. We are either "servants
   of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness," Rom. vi. 16.
   This is the substance of the discourse of the apostle in that whole
   chapter, -- namely, that the state of the soul, as unto life and death
   eternal, follows the conduct and rule that we are under. If sin have
   the dominion, we are lost forever; if it be dethroned, we are safe. It
   may tempt, seduce, and entice; it may fight, war, perplex, and
   disquiet; it may surprise into actual sin: yet if it have not the
   dominion in us, we are in a state of grace and acceptation with God.

Chapter II.

   The inquiries for understanding the text proposed -- The first spoken
   to, namely, What is the dominion of sin, which we are freed from and
   discharged of by grace.

   We shall inquire into three things from the words of this text:-- I.
   What is that dominion of sin which we are freed from and discharged of
   by grace. II. How we may know whether sin hath the dominion in us or
   not. III. What is the reason and evidence of the assurance here given
   us that sin shall not have dominion over us, -- namely, because we are
   "not under the law, but under grace."

   I. As unto the first of these, I shall only recount some such
   properties of it as will discover its nature in general; the
   particulars wherein it doth consist will be considered afterward.

   First, The dominion of sin is perverse and evil, and that on both the
   accounts which render any rule or dominion so to be; for, --

   1. It is usurped. Sin hath no right to rule in the souls of men. Men
   have no power to give sin a right to rule over them. They may
   voluntarily enslave themselves unto it; but this gives sin no right or
   title. All men have originally another lord, unto whom they owe all
   obedience, nor can any thing discharge them from their allegiance
   thereunto; and this is the law of God. The apostle saith, indeed, that
   "to whom men yield themselves servants to obey, his servants they are
   to whom they obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto
   righteousness," Rom. vi. 16. And so it is. Men are thereby the proper
   servants of sin; they become so by their own voluntary subjection unto
   it. But this gives sin no title against the law of God, whose right
   alone it is to bear sway in the souls of men; for all that give up
   themselves to the service of sin do live in actual rebellion against
   their natural liege Lord: Hence sundry things do follow:--

   (1.) The great aggravation of the evil of a state of sin. Men who live
   therein do voluntarily wrest themselves, what lieth in them, from under
   the rule of the law of God, and give up themselves to be slaves unto
   this tyrant. Could it lay any claim to this dominion, had it any title
   to plead, it were some alleviation of guilt in them that give up
   themselves unto it. But men "yield themselves" to the slavery of sin,
   as the apostle speaks; they reject the rule of God's law, and choose
   this foreign yoke; which cannot but be an aggravation of their sin and
   misery. Yet so it is, that the greatest part of men do visibly and
   openly profess themselves the servants and slaves of sin. They wear its
   livery and do all its drudgery; yea, they boast themselves in their
   bondage, and never think themselves so brave and gallant as when, by
   profane swearing, drunkenness, uncleanness, covetousness, and scoffing
   at religion, they openly avow the lord whom they serve, the master to
   whom they do belong. But their "damnation slumbereth not," whatever
   they may dream in the meantime.

   (2.) Hence it follows that ordinarily all men have a right in
   themselves to cast off the rule of sin, and to vindicate themselves
   into liberty. They may, when they will, plead the right and title of
   the law of God unto the rule of their souls, to the utter exclusion of
   all pleas and pretences of sin for its power. They have right to say
   unto it, "Get thee hence; what have I to do any more with idols?"

   All men, I say, have this right in themselves, because of the natural
   allegiance they owe to the law of God; but they have not power of
   themselves to execute this right, and actually to cast off the yoke of
   sin: but this is the work of grace. Sin's dominion is broken only by
   grace.

   But you will say then, "Unto what end serves this right, if they have
   not power in themselves to put it in execution? and how can it be
   charged as an aggravation of their sin that they do not use the right
   which they have, seeing they have no power so to do? Will you blame a
   man that hath a right to an estate if he do not recover it, when he
   hath no means so to do?"

   I answer briefly three things:--

   [1.] No man living neglects the use of this right to cast off the yoke
   and dominion of sin because he cannot of himself make use of it, but
   merely because he will not. He doth voluntarily choose to continue
   under the power of sin, and looks on every thing as his enemy that
   would deliver him: "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is
   not subject unto the law of God, neither indeed can be," Rom. viii. 7.
   When the law comes at any time to claim its right and rule over the
   soul, a man under the power of sin looks on it as his enemy, that comes
   to disturb his peace, and fortifies his mind against it; and when the
   gospel comes and tenders the way and means for the soul's delivery,
   offering its aid and assistance unto that end, this also is looked on
   as an enemy, and is rejected, and all its offers unto that end. See
   Prov. i. 24-31; John iii. 19. This, then, is the condition of every one
   that abides under the dominion of sin: he chooses so to do; he
   continues in that state by an act of his own will; he avows an enmity
   unto every thing which would give him deliverance; -- which will be a
   sore aggravation of his condemnation at the last day.

   [2.] God may justly require that of any which it is in the power of the
   grace of the gospel to enable them to perform and comply withal; for
   this is tendered unto them in the preaching of it every day. And
   although we know not the ways and means of the effectual communication
   of grace unto the souls of men, yet this is certain, that grace is so
   tendered in the preaching of the gospel, that none go without it, none
   are destitute of its aids and assistances, but those alone who, by a
   free act of their own wills, do refuse and reject it. This is that
   which the whole cause depends on, "Ye will not come to me that ye might
   have life;" and this all unbelievers have, or may have, experience of
   in themselves. They may know, on a due examination of themselves, that
   they do voluntarily refuse the assistance of grace which is offered for
   their deliverance: therefore is their destruction of themselves. But,
   --

   [3.] There is a time when men lose even the right also. He who gave up
   himself to have his ear bored lost all his claim unto future liberty;
   he was not to go out at the year of jubilee: so there is a time when
   God judicially gives up men to the rule of sin, to abide under it
   forever, so as that they lose all right unto liberty. So he dealt with
   many of the idolatrous Gentiles of old, Rom. i. 24, 26, 28, and so he
   continues to deal with the like profligate sinners; so he acts towards
   the generality of the antichristian world, 2 Thess. ii. 11, 12, and
   with many despisers of the gospel, Isa. vi. 9, 10. When it is come to
   this, men are cast at law, and have lost all right and title unto
   liberty from the dominion of sin. They may repine sometimes at the
   service of sin, or the consequence of it, in shame and pain, in the
   shameful distempers that will pursue many in their uncleanness; yet God
   having given them up judicially unto sin, they have not so much as a
   right to put up one prayer or petition for deliverance, nor will they
   do so, but are bound in the fetters of cursed presumption or despair.
   See their work and wages, Rom. ii. 5, 6. This is the most woful state
   and condition of sinners in this world, -- an unavoidable entrance into
   the chambers of death. You that have lived long under the power of sin,
   beware lest that come upon you which is spoken of in these scriptures!
   You have as yet a right unto deliverance from that bondage and
   servitude wherein you are, if you put in your claim in the court of
   heaven. You know not how soon you may be deprived of this also, by
   God's giving you up judicially unto sin and Satan. Then all complaints
   will be too late, and all springs of endeavours for relief be utterly
   dried up. All your reserves for a future repentance shall be cut off,
   and all your cries shall be despised, Prov. i. 24-31. Whilst it is yet
   called To-day, harden not your hearts, lest God swear in his wrath that
   you shall never enter into his rest.

   That you may be warned, take notice that the signs or symptoms of the
   approach of such a season, of such an irrecoverable condition, are, --
   (1.) A long continuance in the practice of any known sin. There are
   bounds to divine patience. The long-suffering of God for a time waits
   for repentance, 1 Pet. iii. 20; 2 Pet. iii. 9: but there is a time when
   it doth only "endure vessels of wrath fitted to destruction," Rom. ix.
   22, which is commonly after a long continuance in known sin. (2.) When
   convictions have been digested, and warnings despised. God doth not
   usually deal thus with men until they have rejected the means of their
   deliverance. There is a generation, indeed, who, from their youth up,
   do live in a contempt of God. Such are those proud sinners whom the
   psalmist describes, Ps. x. 2-7, etc. There are seldom any tokens of the
   going forth of the decree against this sort of men. The appearing
   evidences of it are their "adding drunkenness to thirst," one kind of
   sin unto another, making a visible progress in sinning, adding boasting
   and a profane contempt of all things sacred unto their course in sin.
   But, ordinarily, those that are in danger of this judicial hardness
   have had warnings and convictions, which made some impression on them;
   but are now left without any calls and rebukes, or at least any sense
   of them. (3.) When men contract the guilt of such sins as seem to
   intrench on the unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost; such as proud,
   contemptuous, malicious reproaches of the ways of God, of holiness, of
   the Spirit of Christ and his gospel. This sort of persons are
   frequently marked in the Scripture as those who at least are nigh unto
   a final and fatal rejection. (4.) A voluntary relinquishment of the
   means of grace and of conversion unto God which men have enjoyed; and
   this is commonly accompanied with a hatred of the word and those by
   whom it is dispensed. Such persons God frequently, and that visibly,
   gives up in an irrecoverable way unto the dominion of sin; he declares
   that he will have no more to do with them. (5.) The resolved choice of
   wicked, profane, unclean, scoffing society. It is very rare that any
   are recovered from that snare. And many other signs there are of the
   near approach of such a hardening judgment as shall give up men
   everlastingly to the service of sin. O that poor sinners would awake
   before it be too late!

   2. This dominion of sin is evil and perverse, not only because it is
   unjust and usurped, but because it is always used and exercised unto
   ill ends, unto the hurt and ruin of them over whom it is. A tyrant, a
   usurper, may make use of his power and rule for good ends, for the good
   of them over whom he rules; but all the ends of the dominion of sin are
   evil unto sinners. Sin in its rule will pretend fair, offer sundry
   advantages and satisfactions unto their minds. They shall have wages
   for their work, pleasure and profit shall come in by it; yea, on divers
   pretences, it will promise them eternal rest at the close of all, at
   least, that they shall not fail of it by any thing they do in its
   service. And by such means it keeps them in security. But the whole
   real design of it, that which in all its power it operates towards, is
   the eternal ruin of their souls; and this sinners will understand when
   it is too late, Jer. ii. 13, 19.

   Secondly, This dominion of sin is not a mere force against the will and
   endeavours of them that are under it. Where all the power and interest
   of sin consist in putting a force on the mind and soul by its
   temptations, there it hath no dominion. It may perplex them, it doth
   not rule over them. Where it hath dominion, it hath the force and power
   of a law in the wills and minds of them in whom it is. Hereby it
   requires obedience of them, and they "yield themselves servants to obey
   it," Rom. vi. 16.

   Wherefore, unto this dominion of sin there is required a consent of the
   will in some measure and degree. The constant reluctancy and conquering
   prevalency of the will against it defeats its title unto rule and
   dominion, as the apostle declares at large in the next chapter. The
   will is the sovereign faculty and power of the soul; whatever principle
   acts in it and determines it, that hath the rule. Notwithstanding light
   and conviction, the determination of the whole, as unto duty and sin,
   is in the power of the will. If the will of sinning be taken away, sin
   cannot have dominion. Here is wisdom: he that can distinguish between
   the impressions of sin upon him and the rule of sin in him is in the
   way of peace. But this ofttimes, -- as we shall farther see, with the
   reason of it, -- is not easily to be attained unto. Convictions, on the
   one hand, will make a great pretence and appearance of an opposition in
   the will unto sin, by their unavoidable impressions on it, when it is
   not so; and disturbed affections, under temptations, will plead that
   the will itself is given up unto the choice and service of sin, when it
   is not so. The will in this matter is like the Thebans' shield; whilst
   that was safe, they conceited themselves victorious even in death.
   However, this case is determined by the light of Scripture and
   experience, and it is here proposed unto a determination.

   Thirdly, It is required unto this dominion of sin that the soul be not
   under any other supreme conduct, -- that is, of the Spirit of God and
   of his grace, -- by the law. This is that which really hath the
   sovereign rule in all believers. They are led by the Spirit, guided by
   the Spirit, acted and ruled by him, and are thereby under the
   government of God and Christ, and no other. With this the rule of sin
   is absolutely inconsistent. No man can at once serve these two masters.
   Grace and sin may be in the same soul at the same time, but they cannot
   bear rule in the same soul at the same time. The throne is singular,
   and will admit but of one ruler. Every evidence we have of being under
   the rule of grace is so that we are not under the dominion of sin.

   This, therefore, is the principal way and means which we have to secure
   our peace and comfort against the pretences of sin unto the
   disquietment of our consciences. Let us endeavour to preserve an
   experience of the rule of grace in our hearts, Col. iii. 15. Under a
   conduct and rule, whence our state is denominated, we are and must be.
   This is either of sin or grace. There is no composition nor
   copartnership between them as to rule: as to residence there is, but
   not as unto rule. If we can assure ourselves of the one, we secure
   ourselves from the other. It is therefore our wisdom, and lies at the
   foundation of all our comforts, that we get evidences and experience of
   our being under the rule of grace; and it will evidence itself, if we
   are not wanting unto a due observation of its acting and operation in
   us. And it will do it, among others, these two ways:--

   1. By keeping up a constancy of design in living to God and after
   conformity unto Christ, notwithstanding the interposition of surprisals
   by temptations and the most urgent solicitations of sin. This is called
   "cleaving unto God with purpose of heart," Acts xi. 23. This will be
   wherever grace hath the rule. As a man that goeth to sea designs some
   certain place and port, whither he guides his course; in his way he
   meets, it may be, with storms and cross winds that drive him out of his
   course, and sometimes directly backward towards the place whence he set
   forth; but his design still holds, and in the pursuit thereof he
   applies his skill and industry to retrieve and recover all his losses
   and back-drivings by cross winds and storms. So is it with a soul under
   the conduct of grace. Its fixed design is to live unto God, but in its
   course it meets with storms and cross winds of temptations, and various
   artifices of sin. These disturb him, disorder him, drive him backwards
   sometimes, as if it would take a contrary course, and return unto the
   coast of sin from whence it set out. But where grace hath the rule and
   conduct, it will weather all these oppositions and obstructions; it
   will "restore the soul," bring it again into order, recover it from the
   confusions and evil frames that it was drawn into. It will give a fresh
   predominancy unto its prevalent design of living unto God in all
   things. It will do this constantly, as often as the soul meets with
   such ruffles from the power of sin. When there is a radical firmitude
   and strength in a cause or design, it will work itself out through all
   changes and variations; but when the strength of any cause is but
   occasion, the first opposition and disorder will ruin us. So if men's
   purpose of living unto God be only occasional, from present
   convictions, the first vigorous opposition or temptation will disorder
   it and overthrow it; but where this is the radical design of the soul,
   from the power of grace, it will break through all such oppositions,
   and recover its prevalency in the mind and affections, Hereby doth it
   evidence its rule, and that the whole interest of sin in the soul is by
   rebellion, and not by virtue of dominion.

   2. It doth so by keeping up a constant exercise of grace in all
   religious duties, or at least a sincere endeavour that so it may be.
   Where sin hath the dominion, it can allow the soul to perform religious
   duties, yea, in some cases to abound in them; but it will take care
   that divine grace be not exercised in them. Whatever there may be of
   delight in duties, or other motions of affection, which light, and
   gifts, and afflictions, and superstition, will occasion, there is no
   exercise of faith and love in them; this belongs essentially and
   inseparably unto the rule of grace. Wherever that bears away, the soul
   will endeavour the constant exercise of grace in all its duties, and
   never be satisfied in the work done without some sense of it. Where it
   fails therein, it will judge itself, and watch against the like
   surprisals; yea, unless it be in case of some great temptation, the
   present sense of the guilt of sin, which is the highest obstruction
   against that spiritual boldness which is required unto the due exercise
   of grace, -- that is, of faith and love in holy duties, -- shall not
   hinder the soul from endeavouring after it or the use of it.

   If by these means, and the like inseparable operations of grace, we can
   have an assuring experience that we are under the rule and conduct of
   it, we may be free in our minds from disturbing apprehensions of the
   dominion of sin; for both cannot bear sway in the same soul.

   Fourthly, It is required hereunto that sin make the soul sensible of
   its power and rule, at least do that which may do so, unless conscience
   be utterly seared and hardened, and so "past feeling." There is no rule
   or dominion but they are or may be sensible of it who are subject
   thereunto. And there are two ways whereby sin in its dominion will make
   them sensible of it in whom it rules:--

   1. In repressing and overcoming the efficacy of the convictions of the
   mind. Those who are under the dominion of sin (as we shall see more
   immediately) may have light into and conviction of their duty in many
   things, and this light and conviction they may follow ordinarily,
   notwithstanding the dominion of sin. As a tyrant will permit his slaves
   and subjects ordinarily to follow their own occasions, but if what they
   would do come, either in matter or manner, to interfere with or oppose
   his interest, he will make them sensible of his power: so sin, where it
   hath the dominion, if men have light and conviction, will allow them
   ordinarily and in many things to comply therewithal; it will allow them
   to pray, to hear the word, to abstain from sundry sins, to perform many
   duties, as is expressly affirmed in the Scripture of many that were
   under the power of sin, and we see it in experience. How much work do
   we see about religion and religious duties, what constant observation
   of the times and seasons of them, how many duties performed morally
   good in themselves and useful, by them who on many other accounts do
   proclaim themselves to be under the dominion of sin! But if the light
   and conviction of this sort of persons do rise up in opposition unto
   the principal interest of sin in those lusts and ways wherein it
   exerciseth its rule, it will make them in whom they are sensible of its
   power. They that stifle, or shut their eyes against, or cast out of
   mind, or go directly contrary unto, their convictions, light in such
   cases will first repine, and then relieve itself with resolutions for
   other times and seasons; but sin will carry the cause by virtue of its
   dominion.

   Hence two things do follow:--

   (1.) A constant repugnancy against sin, from light in the mind and
   conviction in the conscience, doth not prove that those in whom it is
   are not under the dominion of sin; for until blindness and hardness do
   come on men to the uttermost, there will be in them a judging of what
   is good and evil, with a self-judging with respect thereunto, as the
   apostle declares, Rom. ii. 15. And herein many do satisfy themselves.
   When their light condemns sin, they suppose they hate it; but they do
   not: when convictions call for duties, they suppose they love them; but
   they do not. That which they look on as the rule of light in them, in
   opposition unto sin, is but the rebellion of a natural enlightened
   conscience against the dominion of it in the heart. In brief, light may
   condemn every known sin, keep from many, press for every known duty,
   lead to the performance of many, yet sin have a full dominion in the
   soul; and this it will evidence when it comes to the trial in those
   instances where it exercises its ruling power.

   (2.) That miserable is their condition whose minds are ground
   continually between the conduct of their light with the urgency of
   conviction on the one hand, and the rule or dominion of sin on the
   other. Wherever light is, it is its due to have the rule and conduct.
   It is that art whereby the mind leads itself. For men to be forced, by
   the power of their lusts, to act for the most part against their light,
   as they do where sin hath the dominion, it is a sad and deplorable
   condition. Such persons are said to "rebel against the light," Job
   xxiv. 13, because of its right to rule in them, where it is deposed by
   sin. This makes most men but a "troubled sea, that cannot rest, whose
   waters cast up mire and dirt."

   2. Sin will make those in whom it hath dominion sensible of its power,
   by its continual solicitation of the mind and affections with respect
   unto that sin or those sins wherein it principally exerciseth its rule.
   Having possessed the will and inclinations of the mind with the
   affections, -- as it doth wherever its dominion is absolute, -- it
   continually disposeth, inclineth, and stirreth up the mind towards
   those sins. It will level the bent of the whole soul towards such sins,
   or the circumstances of them. Nor is there a more pregnant discovery of
   the rule of sin in any than this, that it habitually engageth the mind
   and affections unto a constant exercise of themselves about this or
   that, some sin and evil way or other.

   But yet we must add, that notwithstanding these indications of the
   ruling power of sin, they are but few in whom it hath this dominion
   that are convinced of their state and condition. Many are so under the
   power of darkness, of supine sloth and negligence, and are so
   desperately wicked, as that they have no sense of this rule of sin.
   Such are those described by the apostle, Eph. iv. 18, 19. And whereas
   they are the vilest slaves that live on the earth, they judge none to
   be free but themselves; they look on others as in bondage to foolish
   and superstitious fears, whilst they are at liberty to drink, swear,
   scoff at religion, whore, and defile themselves without control. This
   is their liberty, and they may have that which is as good in hell, -- a
   liberty to curse and blaspheme God, and to fly with revengeful thoughts
   on themselves and the whole creation. The light in such persons is
   darkness itself, so be that they have nothing to rise up in opposition
   unto the rule of sin, whence alone a sense of its power doth arise.
   Others, as we observed before, living in some compliance with their
   light and convictions, abstaining from many sins and performing many
   duties, though they live in some known sin or other, and allow
   themselves in it, yet will not allow that sin hath the dominion in
   them.

   Wherefore, there are two things hard and difficult in this case:--

   1. To convince those in whom sin evidently hath the dominion that such
   indeed is their state and condition. They will with their utmost
   endeavour keep off the conviction hereof. Some justify themselves, some
   excuse themselves, and some will make no inquiry into this matter. It
   is a rare thing, especially of late, to have any brought under this
   conviction by the preaching of the word, though it be the case of
   multitudes that attend unto it.

   2. To satisfy some that sin hath not the dominion over them,
   notwithstanding its restless acting itself in them and warring against
   their souls; yet unless this can be done, it is impossible they should
   enjoy solid peace and comfort in this life. And the concernment of the
   best of believers, whilst they are in this world, doth lie herein; for
   as they grow in light, spirituality, experience, freedom of mind and
   humility, the more they love to know of the deceit, activity, and power
   of the remainders of sin. And although it works not at all, at least
   not sensibly, in them, towards those sins wherein it reigneth and
   rageth in others, yet they are able to discern its more subtile,
   inward, and spiritual actings in the mind and heart, to the weakening
   of grace, the obstructing of its effectual operations in holy duties,
   with many indispositions unto stability in the life of God; which fills
   them with trouble.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter III.

   The second inquiry spoken to, Whether sin hath dominion in us or not --
   In answer to which it is showed that some wear sin's livery, and they
   are the professed servants thereof -- There are many in which the case
   is dubious, where sin's service is not so discernible -- Several
   exceptions are put in against its dominion where it seems to prevail --
   Some certain signs of its dominion -- Graces and duties to be exercised
   for its mortification.

   II. These things being thus premised in general concerning the nature
   of the dominion of sin, we shall now proceed unto our principal
   inquiry, -- namely, Whether sin have dominion in us or no, whereby we
   may know whether we are under the law or under grace, or what is the
   state of our souls towards God. An inquiry this is which is very
   necessary for some to make, and for all to have rightly determined in
   their minds, from Scripture and experience; for on that determination
   depends all our solid peace. Sin will be in us; it will lust, fight,
   and entice us; -- but the great question, as unto our peace and
   comfort, is, whether it hath dominion over us or no.

   First, We do not inquire concerning them in whom the reign of sin is
   absolute and easily discernible, if not to themselves yet to others.
   Such there are who visibly "yield their members instruments of
   unrighteousness unto sin," Rom. vi. 13. "Sin reigns in their mortal
   bodies," and they openly "obey it in the lusts thereof," verse 12. They
   are avowedly "servants of sin unto death," verse 16, and are not
   ashamed of it. "The show of their countenance doth witness against
   them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not," Isa. iii.
   9. Such are those described Eph. iv. 18, 19, and such the world is
   filled withal; such as, being under the power of darkness and enmity
   against God, do act them in opposition to all serious godliness and in
   the service of various lusts. There is no question concerning their
   state; they cannot themselves deny that it is so with them. I speak not
   for the liberty of censuring, but for the easiness of judging. Those
   who openly wear sin's livery may well be esteemed to be sin's servants;
   and they shall not fail to receive sin's wages. Let them at present
   bear it never so high, and despise all manner of convictions, they will
   find it, bitterness in the latter end, Isa. l. 11; Eccles. xi. 9.

   Secondly, But there are many in whom the case is dubious and not easily
   to be determined; for, on the one hand, they may have sundry things in
   them which may seem repugnant unto the reign of sin, but indeed are not
   inconsistent with it. All arguments and pleas from them in their
   vindication may fail them on a trial. And, on the other hand, there may
   be some in whom the effectual working of sin may be so great and
   perplexing as to argue that it hath the dominion, when indeed it hath
   not, but is only a stubborn rebel.

   The things of the first sort, which seem destructive of and
   inconsistent with the dominion of sin, but indeed are not, may be
   referred to five heads:--

   1. Illumination in knowledge and spiritual gifts, with convictions of
   good and evil, of all known duties and sins. This is that which some
   men live in a perpetual rebellion against, in one instance or another.

   2. A change in the affections, giving a temporary delight in religious
   duties, with some constancy in their observation. This also is found in
   many who are yet evidently under the power of sin and spiritual
   darkness.

   3. A performance of many duties, both moral and evangelical, for the
   substance of them, and an abstinence, out of conscience, from many
   sins. So was it with the young man in the Gospel, who yet wanted what
   was necessary to free him from the dominion of sin, Matt. xix. 20-23.

   4. Repentance for sin committed. This is that which most secure
   themselves by; and a blessed security it is when it is gracious,
   evangelical, a fruit of faith, comprising the return of the whole soul
   to God. But there is that which is legal, partial, respecting
   particular sins only, which is not pleadable in this case. Ahab was no
   less under the dominion of sin when he had repented him than he was
   before; and Judas repented him before he hanged himself.

   5. Promises and resolutions against sin for the future. But the
   goodness of many in these things is "as a morning cloud, and as the
   early dew it goeth away," as it is in the prophet, Hosea vi. 4.

   Where there is a concurrence of these things in any, they have good
   hopes, at least, that they are not under the dominion of sin, nor is it
   easy to convince them that they are; and they may so behave themselves
   herein as that it is not consistent with Christian charity to pronounce
   them to be so. Howbeit, the fallacy that is in these things hath been
   detected by many; and much more is by all required to evidence the
   sincerity of faith and holiness. No man, therefore, can be acquitted by
   pleas taken from them, as unto his subjection to the reign of sin.

   The things of the second sort, whence arguments may be taken to prove
   the dominion of sin in any person, which yet will not certainly do it,
   are those which we shall now examine. And we must observe, --

   1. That where sin hath the dominion, it doth indeed rule in the whole
   soul and all the faculties of it. It is a vicious habit in all of them,
   corrupting them, in their several natures and powers, with that
   corruption whereof they are capable:-- So in the mind, of darkness and
   vanity; the will, of spiritual deceit and perverseness; the heart, of
   stubbornness and sensuality. Sin in its power reaches unto and affects
   them all. But, --

   2. It doth evidence its dominion and is to be tried by its acting in
   the distinct faculties of the mind, in the frame of the heart, and in
   the course of the life.

   These are those which we shall examine:-- first, those which render the
   case dubious; and then those that clearly determine it on the part of
   sin. I shall not, therefore, at present, give positive evidences of
   men's freedom from the dominion of sin, but only consider the arguments
   that lie against them, and examine how far they are conclusive, or how
   they may be defeated. And, --

   1. When sin hath in any instance possessed the imagination, and thereby
   engaged the cogitative faculty in its service, it is a dangerous
   symptom of its rule or dominion. Sin may exercise its rule in the mind,
   fancy, and imagination, where bodily strength or opportunity gives no
   advantage for its outward perpetration. In them the desires of sin may
   be enlarged as hell, and the satisfaction of lust taken in with
   greediness. Pride, and covetousness, and sensuality, may reign and rage
   in the mind by corrupt imaginations, when their outward exercise is
   shut up by circumstances of life.

   The first way whereby sin acts itself, or coins its motions and
   inclinations into acts, is by the imagination, Gen. vi. 5. The
   continual evil figments of the heart are as the bubbling of corrupt
   waters from a corrupted fountain.

   The imaginations intended are the fixing of the mind on the objects of
   sin or sinful objects, by continual thoughts, with delight and
   complacency. They are the mind's purveying for the satisfaction of the
   flesh in the lusts thereof, Rom. xiii. 14, whereby evil thoughts come
   to lodge, to abide, to dwell in the heart, Jer. iv. 14.

   This is the first and proper effect of that vanity of mind whereby the
   soul is alienated from the life of God. The mind being turned off from
   its proper object, with a dislike of it, applies itself by its thoughts
   and imaginations unto the pleasures and advantages of sin, seeking in
   vain to recover the rest and satisfaction which they have forsaken in
   God himself: "They follow after lying vanities, and forsake their own
   mercies," Jonah ii. 8. And when they give themselves up unto a constant
   internal converse with the desires of the flesh, the pleasures and
   advantages of sin, with delight and approbation, sin may reign
   triumphantly in them, though no appearance be made of it in their
   outward conversation. Such are they who have "a form of godliness, but
   deny the power thereof;" their hearts being filled with a litter of
   ungodly lusts, as the apostle declares, 2 Tim. iii. 5.

   And there are three evils with respect whereunto sin doth exercise its
   reigning power in the imagination in an especial manner:--

   (1.) Pride, self-elation, desire of power and greatness. It is affirmed
   of the prince of Tyrus, that he said "he was a god, and sat in the seat
   of God," Ezek. xxviii. 2; and the like foolish thoughts are ascribed
   unto the king of Babylon, Isa. xiv. 13, 14. None of the children of men
   can attain so great glory, power, and dominion in this world, but that
   in their imaginations and desires they can infinitely exceed what they
   do enjoy, like him who wept that he had not another world to conquer.
   They have no bounds but to be as God, yea, to be God; which was the
   first design of sin in the world: and there is none so poor and low but
   by his imaginations he can lift up and exalt himself almost into the
   place of God. This vanity and madness God reproves in his discourse
   with Job xl. 9-14; and there is nothing more germane and proper unto
   the original depravation and corruption of our natures than this
   self-exaltation in foolish thoughts and imaginations, because it first
   came upon us through a desire of being as God. Herein, therefore, may
   sin exercise its dominion in the minds of men; yea, in the empty wind
   and vanity of these imaginations, with those that follow, consists the
   principal part of the deceitful ways of sin. The ways of men cannot
   satisfy themselves with what sins they can actually commit; but in
   these imaginations they rove endlessly, finding satisfaction in their
   renovation and variety, Isa. lvii. 10.

   (2.) Sensuality and uncleanness of life. It is said of some that they
   have "eyes full of adultery," and that they "cannot cease from sin," 2
   Pet. ii. 14; that is, their imaginations are continually working about
   the objects of their unclean lusts. These they think of night and day,
   immiring themselves in all filth continually. Jude calls them "filthy
   dreamers, defiling the flesh," verse 8. They live as in a constant
   pleasing dream by their vile imaginations, even when they cannot
   accomplish their lustful desires; for such imaginations cannot be
   better expressed than by dreams, wherein men satisfy themselves with a
   supposed acting of what they do not. Hereby do many wallow in the mire
   of uncleanness all their days, and for the most part are never wanting
   unto the effects of it when they have opportunity and advantage; and by
   this means the most cloistered recluses may live in constant
   adulteries, whereby multitudes of them become actually the sinks of
   uncleanness. This is that which, in the root of it, is severely
   condemned by our Saviour, Matt. v. 28.

   (3.) Unbelief, distrust, and hard thoughts of God, are of the same
   kind. These will sometimes so possess the imaginations of men as to
   keep them off from all delight in God, to put them on contrivances of
   fleeing from him; which is a peculiar case, not here to be spoken unto.

   In these and the like ways may sin exercise its dominion in the soul by
   the mind and its imagination. It may do so when no demonstration is
   made of it in the outward conversation; for by this means the minds of
   men are defiled, and then nothing is clean, all things are impure unto
   them, Tit. i. 15. Their minds being thus defiled, do defile all things
   to them, -- their enjoyments, their duties, all they have, and all that
   they do.

   But yet all failing and sin in this kind doth not prove absolutely that
   sin hath the dominion in the mind that it had before. Something of this
   vice and evil may be found in them that are freed from the reign of
   sin; and there will be so until the vanity of our minds is perfectly
   cured and taken away, which will not be in this world. Wherefore I
   shall name the exceptions that may be put in against the title of sin
   unto dominion in the soul, notwithstanding the continuance in some
   measure of this work of the imagination in coining evil figments in the
   heart. And, --

   (1.) This is no evidence of the dominion of sin, where it is
   occasional, arising from the prevalency of some present temptation.
   Take an instance in the case of David. I no way doubt but that in his
   temptation with Bathsheba, his mind was possessed with defiling
   imaginations. Wherefore, on his repentance, he not only prays for the
   forgiveness of his sin, but cries out with all fervency that God would
   "create a clean heart in him," Ps. li. 10. He was sensible not only of
   the defilement of his person by his actual adultery, but of his heart
   by impure imaginations. So it may be in the case of other temptations.
   Whilst men are entangled with any temptation, of what sort soever it
   be, it will multiply thoughts about it in the mind; yea, its whole
   power consists in a multiplication of evil imaginations. By them it
   blinds the mind, draws it off from the consideration of its duty, and
   enticeth it unto a full conception of sin, James i. 14, 15. Wherefore,
   in this case of a prevalent temptation, which may befall a true
   believer, the corrupt working of the imagination doth not prove the
   dominion of sin.

   If it be inquired how the mind may be freed and cleared of these
   perplexing, defiling imaginations, which arise from the urgency of some
   present temptation, -- suppose about earthly affairs, or the like, -- I
   say it will never be done by the most strict watch and resolution
   against them, nor by the most resolute rejection of them. They will
   return with new violence and new presences, though the soul hath
   promised itself a thousand times that so they should not do. There is
   but one way for the cure of this distemper, and this is a thorough
   mortification of the lust that feeds them and is fed by them. It is to
   no purpose to shake off the fruit in this case unless we dig up the
   root. Every temptation designs the satisfaction of some lust of the
   flesh or of the mind. These evil thoughts and imaginations are the
   working of the temptation in the mind. There is no riddance of them, no
   conquest to be obtained over them, but by subduing the temptation; and
   no subduing the temptation but by the mortification of the lust whose
   satisfaction it is designed unto. This course the apostle directs unto,
   Col. iii. 3, 5. That which he enjoins is, that we would not set our
   minds on the things of the earth, in opposition unto the things above;
   that is, that we would not fill our imaginations, and thereby our
   affections, with them. But what is the way whereby we may be enabled so
   to do? -- that is, saith he, the universal mortification of sin, verse
   5.

   For want of the wisdom and knowledge hereof, or for want of its
   practice, through a secret unwillingness to come up unto a full
   mortification of sin, some are galled and perplexed, yea, and defiled,
   with foolish and vain imaginations all their days; and although they
   prove not the dominion of sin, yet they will deprive the soul of that
   peace and comfort which otherwise it might enjoy.

   But yet there is much spiritual skill and diligence required to
   discover what is the true root and spring of the foolish imaginations
   that may at any time possess the mind; for they lie deep in the heart,
   that heart which is deep and deceitful, and so are not easily
   discoverable. There are many other pretences of them. They do not
   directly bespeak that pride or those unclean lusts which they proceed
   from, but they make many other pretences and feign other ends; but the
   soul that is watchful and diligent may trace them to their original.
   And if such thoughts are strictly examined at any time, what is their
   design, whose work they do, what makes them so busy in the mind, they
   will confess the truth, both whence they came and what it is they aim
   at. Then is the mind guided unto its duty; which is the extermination
   of the lust which they would make provision for.

   (2.) Such imaginations are no evidence of the dominion of sin, in what
   degree soever they are, where they are afflictive, where they are a
   burden unto the soul, which it groans under and would be delivered
   from. There is a full account given by the apostle of the conflict
   between indwelling sin and grace, Rom. vii. And the things which he
   ascribes unto sin are not the first rising or involuntary motions of
   it, nor merely its inclinations and disposition; for the things
   ascribed unto it, as that it fights, rebels, wars, leads captive, acts
   as a law, cannot belong unto them. Nor doth he intend the outward
   acting or perpetration of sin, the doing, or accomplishing, or
   finishing of it; for that cannot befall believers, as the apostle
   declares, 1 John iii. 9. But it is the working of sin by these
   imaginations in the mind, and the engagement of the affections thereon,
   that he doth intend. Now, this he declares to be the great burden of
   the souls of believers, that which makes them think their condition
   wretched and miserable in some sort, and which they earnestly cry out
   for deliverance from, Rom. vii. 24. This is the present case. These
   figments of the heart, these imaginations, will arise in the minds of
   men. They will do so sometimes to a high degree. They will impose them
   on us with deceit and violence, leading captive unto the law of them.
   Where they are rejected, condemned, defied, they will return again
   while there is any vanity remaining in the mind or corruption in the
   affections. But if the soul be sensible of them, if it labour under
   them, if it look on them as those that fight against its purity,
   holiness, and peace, if it pray for deliverance from them, they are no
   argument of the dominion of sin; yea, a great evidence unto the
   contrary may be taken from that firm opposition unto them which the
   mind is constantly engaged in.

   (3.) They are not proofs of the dominion of sin when there is a
   prevalent detestation of the lust from whence they proceed, and whose
   promotion they design, maintained in the heart and mind. I confess,
   sometimes this cannot be discovered. And all such various imaginations
   are but mere effects of the incurable vanity and instability of our
   minds, for these administer continual occasion unto random thoughts;
   but, for the most part (as we observed before), they are employed in
   the service of some lust, and tend unto the satisfaction of it. They
   are that which is prohibited by the apostle: Rom. xiii. 14, "Make not
   provision for the flesh." And this may be discovered on strict
   examination. Now, when the mind is fixed in a constant detestation of
   that sin whereunto they lead, as it is sin against God, with a firm
   resolution against it, in all circumstances that may occur, no proof
   can be thence taken for the dominion of sin.

   (4.) Sometimes evil thoughts are the immediate injections of Satan, and
   they are on many accounts most terrible unto the soul. Usually, for the
   matter of them, they are dreadful, and ofttimes blasphemous; and as
   unto the manner of their entrance into the mind, it is, for the most
   part, surprising, furious, and irresistible. From such thoughts many
   have concluded themselves to be absolutely under the power of sin and
   Satan. But they are by certain rules and infallible signs discoverable
   from whence they do proceed; and on that discovery all pretences unto
   the dominion of sin in them must disappear.

   And this is the first case, which renders the question dubious whether
   sin have the dominion in us or no.

   2. It is a sign of the dominion of sin, when, in any instance, it hath
   a prevalency in our affections; yea, they are the throne of sin, where
   it acts its power. But this case of the affections I have handled so at
   large in my discourse of Spiritual-mindedness, [3] as I shall here very
   briefly speak unto it, so as to give one rule only to make a judgment
   by concerning the dominion of sin in them.

   This is certain, that where sin hath the prevalency and predominancy in
   our affections, there it hath the dominion in the whole soul. The rule
   is given us unto this purpose, 1 John ii. 15. We are obliged to "love
   the Lord our God with all our heart and with all our soul;" and
   therefore if there be in us a predominant love to any thing else,
   whereby it is preferred unto God, it must be from the prevalency of a
   principle of sin in us. And so it is with respect unto all other
   affections. If we love any thing more than God, as we do if we will not
   part with it for his sake, be it as a right eye or as a right hand unto
   us; if we take more satisfaction and complacency in it, and cleave more
   unto it in our thoughts and minds than unto God, as men commonly do in
   their lusts, interests, enjoyments, and relations; if we trust more to
   it, as unto a supply of our wants, than unto God, as most do to the
   world; if our desires are enlarged and our diligence heightened in
   seeking after and attaining other things, more than towards the love
   and favour of God; if we fear the loss of other things or danger from
   them more than we fear God, -- we are not under the rule of God or his
   grace, but we are under the dominion of sin, which reigns in our
   affections.

   It were endless to give instances of this power of sin in and over the
   affections of men. Self-love, love of the world, delight in things
   sensual, an over-valuation of relations and enjoyments, with sundry
   other things of an alike nature, will easily evidence it. And to
   resolve the case under consideration, we may observe, --

   (1.) That the prevalency of sin in the affections, so far as to be a
   symptom of its dominion, is discernible unto the least beam of
   spiritual light, with a diligent searching into and judgment of
   ourselves. If it be so with any that they know it not, nor will be
   convinced of it (as it is with many), I know not what can free them
   from being under the reign of sin. And we see it so every day. Men all
   whose ways and actions proclaim that they are acted in all things by an
   inordinate love of the world and self, yet find nothing amiss in
   themselves, nothing that they do not approve of, unless it be that
   their desires are not satisfied according to their expectations. All
   the commands we have in the Scripture for self-searching, trial, and
   examination; all the rules that are given us unto that end; all the
   warnings we have of the deceitfulness of sin and of our own hearts, --
   are given us to prevent this evil of shutting our eyes against the
   prevalent corruption and disorder of our affections. And the issue of
   all our endeavours in this kind is in the appeal of David to God
   himself, Ps. cxxxix. 23, 24.

   (2.) When men have convictions of the irregularity and disorder of
   their affections, yet are resolved to continue in the state wherein
   they are without the correction and amendment of them, because of some
   advantage and satisfaction which they receive in their present state,
   they seem to be under the dominion of sin. So is it with those
   mentioned, Isa. lvii. 10. Upon the account of the present satisfaction,
   delight, and pleasure, that their corrupt affections do take in
   cleaving inordinately unto their objects, they will not endeavour their
   change and alteration.

   This, then, is the sole safe rule in this case: Whatever hold sin may
   have got on our affections, whatever prevalency it may have in them,
   however it may entangle and defile them, if we endeavour sincerely the
   discovery of this evil, and thereon set ourselves constantly unto the
   mortification of our corrupt affections by all due means, there is not
   in their disorder any argument to prove the dominion of sin in us. Our
   affections, as they are corrupt, are the proper objects of the great
   duty of mortification; which the apostle therefore calls our "members
   which are upon the earth," Col. iii. 5. This is a safe anchor for the
   soul in this storm. If it live in a sincere endeavour after the
   mortification of every discoverable corruption and disorder in the
   affections, it is secure from the dominion of sin. But as for such as
   are negligent in searching after the state of their souls, as unto the
   inclination and engagement of their affections, who approve of
   themselves in their greatest irregularities, resolvedly indulge
   themselves in any way of sin to gratify their corrupt affections, they
   must provide themselves of pleas for their vindication; I know them
   not. But the meaning of our present rule will be farther manifest in
   what ensues.

   3. It is a dangerous sign of the dominion of sin, when, after a
   conviction of their necessity, it prevaileth unto a neglect of those
   ways and duties which are peculiarly suited, directed, and ordained,
   unto its mortification and destruction. This may be cleared in some
   particulars:--

   (1.) Mortification of sin is the constant duty of all believers, of all
   who would not have sin have dominion over them. Where mortification is
   sincere, there is no dominion of sin; and where there is no
   mortification, there sin doth reign.

   (2.) There are some graces and duties that are peculiarly suited and
   ordained unto this end, that by them and their agency the work of
   mortification may be carried on constantly in our souls. What they are,
   or some of them, we shall see immediately.

   (3.) When sin puts forth its power in any especial lust, or in a strong
   inclination unto any actual sin, then it is the duty of the soul to
   make diligent application of those graces and duties which are
   specifical and proper unto its mortification.

   (4.) When men have had a conviction of these duties, and have attended
   unto them according to that conviction, if sin prevail in them to a
   neglect or relinquishment of those duties as unto their performance, or
   as unto their application unto the mortification of sin, it is a
   dangerous sign that sin hath dominion in them. And I distinguish
   between these things, -- namely, a neglect of such duties as unto their
   performance, and a neglect of the application of them unto the
   mortification of sin; for men may on other accounts continue the
   observance of them, or some of them, and yet not apply them unto this
   especial end. And so all external duties may be observed when sin
   reigneth in triumph, 2 Tim. iii. 5.

   The meaning of the assertion being stated, I shall now name some of
   those graces and duties upon whose omission and neglect sin may
   prevail, as unto an application of them unto the mortification of any
   sin:--

   The first is, the daily exercise of faith on Christ as crucified. This
   is the great fundamental means of the mortification of sin in general,
   and which we ought to apply unto every particular instance of it. This
   the apostle discourseth at large, Rom. vi. 6-13. "Our old man," saith
   he, "is crucified with Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed,
   that henceforth we should not serve sin." Our "old man," or the body of
   sin, is the power and reign of sin in us. These are to be destroyed;
   that is, so mortified that "henceforth we should not serve sin," that
   we should be delivered from the power and rule of it. This, saith the
   apostle, is done in Christ: "Crucified with him." It is so
   meritoriously, in his actual dying or being crucified for us; it is so
   virtually, because of the certain provision that is made therein for
   the mortification of all sin; but it is so actually, by the exercise of
   faith on him as crucified, dead, and buried, which is the means of the
   actual communication of the virtue of his death unto us for that end.
   Herein are we said to be dead and buried with him; whereof baptism is
   the pledge. So by the cross of Christ the world is crucified unto us,
   and we are so to the world, Gal. vi. 14; which is the substance of the
   mortification of all sin. There are several ways whereby the exercise
   of faith on Christ crucified is effectual unto this end:--

   [1.] Looking unto him as such will beget holy mourning in us: Zech.
   xii. 10, "They shall look on me whom they have pierced, and mourn." It
   is a promise of gospel times and gospel grace. A view of Christ as
   pierced will cause mourning in them that have received the promise of
   the Spirit of grace and supplication there mentioned. And this mourning
   is the foundation of mortification. It is that "godly sorrow which
   worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of," 2 Cor. vii. 10.
   And mortification of sin is of the essence of repentance. The more
   believers are exercised in this view of Christ, the more humble they
   are, the more they are kept in that mourning frame which is universally
   opposite unto all the interests of sin, and which keeps the soul
   watchful against all its attempts. Sin never reigned in an humble,
   mourning soul.

   [2.] It is effectual unto the same end by the way of a powerful motive,
   as that which calls and leads unto conformity to him. This is pressed
   by the apostle, Rom. vi. 8-11. Our conformity unto Christ as crucified
   and dead consists in our being dead unto sin, and thereby overthrowing
   the reign of it in our mortal bodies. This conformity, saith he, we
   ought to reckon on as our duty: "Reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed
   unto sin;" that is, that you ought so to be, in that conformity which
   you ought to aim at unto Christ crucified. Can any spiritual eye behold
   Christ dying for sin, and continue to live in sin? Shall we keep that
   alive in us which he died for, that it might not eternally destroy us?
   Can we behold him bleeding for our sins, and not endeavour to give them
   their death-wound? The efficacy of the exercise of faith herein unto
   the mortification of sin is known unto all believers by experience.

   [3.] Faith herein gives us communion with him in his death, and unites
   the soul unto it in its efficacy. Hence we are said to be "buried with
   him into death," and to be "planted together in the likeness of his
   death," Rom. vi. 4, 5. Our "old man is crucified with him," verse 6. We
   have by faith communion with him in his death, unto the death of sin.

   This, therefore, is the first grace and duty which we ought to attend
   unto for the mortification of sin. But where sin hath that interest and
   power in the mind as to take it off from this exercise of faith, to
   prevent or obstruct it, as it will do, so as that it shall not dare to
   think or meditate on Christ crucified, because of the inconsistency of
   such thoughts with an indulgence unto any lust, it is to be feared that
   sin is in the throne.

   If it be thus with any; if they have not yet made use of this way and
   means for the mortification of sin; or if, being convinced of it, they
   have been for any season driven or withheld from the exercise of faith
   herein, -- I have nothing to offer to free them from this evidence of
   the reign of sin, but only that they would speedily and carefully
   address themselves unto their duty herein; and if they prevail on
   themselves unto it, it will bring in its own evidence of their freedom.

   Some, it may be, will say that indeed they are "unskilful" in this
   "word of righteousness," as some are, Heb. v. 13. They know not how to
   make use of Christ crucified unto this end, nor how to set themselves
   about it. Other ways of mortification they can understand. The
   discipline and penances assigned by the Papists unto this end are
   sensible; so are our own vows and resolutions, with other duties that
   are prescribed; but as for this way of deriving virtue from the death
   of Christ unto the death of sin, they can understand nothing of it.

   I easily believe that some may say so, yea, ought to say so, if they
   would speak their minds; for the spiritual wisdom of faith is required
   hereunto, but "all men have not faith." On the loss of this wisdom, the
   Papists have invented another way to supply the whole exercise of faith
   herein. They will make crucifixes, -- images of Christ crucified, then
   they will adore, embrace, mourn over, and expect great virtue from
   them. Without these images they know no way of addressing unto Christ
   for the communication of any virtue from his death or life. Others may
   be at the same loss; but they may do well to consider the cause of it:
   for, is it not from ignorance of the mystery of the gospel, and of the
   communication of supplies of spiritual things from Christ thereby, --
   of the efficacy of his life and death unto our sanctification and
   mortification of sin? Or is it not because indeed they have never been
   thoroughly distressed in their minds and consciences by the power of
   sin, and so have never in good earnest looked for relief? Light,
   general convictions, either of the guilt or power of sin, will drive
   none to Christ. When their consciences are reduced unto real straits,
   and they know not what to do, they will learn better how to "look unto
   Him whom they have pierced." Their condition, whoever they are, is
   dangerous, who find not a necessity every day of applying themselves by
   faith unto Christ for help and succour. Or is it not because they have
   other reliefs to betake themselves unto? Such are their own promises
   and resolutions; which, for the most part, serve only to cheat and
   quiet conscience for an hour or a day, and then vanish into nothing.
   But whatever be the cause of this neglect, those in whom it is will
   pine away in their sins; for nothing but the death of Christ for us
   will be the death of sin in us.

   Secondly, Another duty necessary unto this end is continual prayer, and
   this is to be considered as unto its application to the prevalency of
   any particular lust wherein sin doth in a peculiar manner exert its
   power. This is the great ordinance of God for its mortification; for,
   --

   [1.] Hereby we obtain spiritual aids and supplies of strength against
   it. We are not more necessarily and fervently to pray that sin may be
   pardoned as to its guilt, than we are that it may be subdued as to its
   power. He who is negligent in the latter is never in good earnest in
   the former. The pressures and troubles which we receive from the power
   of sin are as pungent on the mind as those from its guilt are on the
   conscience. Mere pardon of sin will never give peace unto a soul,
   though it can have none without it. It must be mortified also, or we
   can have no spiritual rest. Now, this is the work of prayer, -- namely,
   to seek and obtain such supplies of mortifying, sanctifying grace, as
   whereby the power of sin may be broken, its strength abated, its root
   withered, its life destroyed, and so the whole old man crucified. That
   which was the apostle's request for the Thessalonians is the daily
   prayer of all believers for themselves, 1 Thess. v. 23.

   [2.] A constant attendance unto this duty in a due manner will preserve
   the soul in such a frame as wherein sin cannot habitually prevail in
   it. He that can live in sin and abide in the ordinary duties of prayer
   doth never once pray as he ought. Formality, or some secret reserve or
   other, vitiates the whole. A truly gracious, praying frame (wherein we
   pray always) is utterly inconsistent with the love of or reserve for
   any sin. To pray well is to pray always, -- that is, to keep the heart
   always in that frame which is required in prayer; and where this is,
   sin can have no rule, no, nor quiet harbour, in the soul.

   [3.] It is the soul's immediate conflict against the power of sin. Sin
   in it is formally considered as the soul's enemy, which fights against
   it. In prayer the soul sets itself to grapple with it, to wound, kill,
   and destroy. It is that whereby it applies all its spiritual engines
   unto its utter ruin; herein it exerciseth a gracious abhorrency of it,
   a clear self-condemnation on the account of it; and engageth faith on
   all the promises of God for its conquest and destruction.

   It is hence evident that if sin hath prevailed in the mind unto a
   negligence of this duty, either in general or as unto the effectual
   application of it unto any especial case where it exerts its power, it
   is an ill symptom of the dominion of sin in the soul.

   It is certain that unmortified sin, sin indulged unto, will gradually
   work out all due regard unto this duty of prayer, and alienate the mind
   from it, either as unto the matter or manner of its performance. We see
   this exemplified every day in apostate professors. They have had a gift
   of prayer, and were constant in the exercise of it; but the love of sin
   and living in it hath devoured their gift, and wholly taken off their
   minds from the duty itself: which is the proper character of hypocrites
   "Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon
   God?" Job xxvii. 10. He may do so for a season, but, falling under the
   power of sin, he will not continue so to do.

   Now, because sin useth great deceit herein, in a gradual progress for
   attaining its end, and thereby securing its dominion, we may, in a way
   of warning or caution, take notice of some of its steps, that the
   entrance of it may be opposed: for as the "entrance of God's word
   giveth light," Ps. cxix. 130, -- the first putting forth of its power
   on the soul gives spiritual light unto the mind, which is to be
   improved, -- so the entrance of sin, the first actings of it on the
   mind, towards the neglect of this duty, brings a deceiving darkness
   with them, which is to be opposed:--

   1st. It will produce in the mind an unreadiness unto this duty in its
   proper seasons. The heart should always rejoice in the approach of such
   seasons, because of the delight in God which it hath in them. To
   rejoice and be glad in all our approaches unto God is every way
   required of us; and therefore, with the thoughts of and on the approach
   of such seasons, we ought to groan in ourselves for such a preparedness
   of mind as may render us meet for that converse with God which we are
   called unto. But where sin begins to prevail, all things will be
   unready and out of order. Strange tergiversations will rise in the
   mind, either as unto the duty itself or as unto the manner of its
   performance. Customariness and formality are the principles which act
   themselves in this case. The body seems to carry the mind to the duty
   whether it will or no, rather than the mind to lead the body in its
   part of it; and it will employ itself in any thing rather than in the
   work and duty that lies before it.

   Herein, then, lies a great part of our wisdom in obviating the power of
   sin in us: Let us keep our hearts continually in a gracious disposition
   and readiness for this duty, in all its proper seasons. If you lose
   this ground, you will yet go more backwards continually. Know,
   therefore, that there is no more effectual preservative of the soul
   from the power of sin than a gracious readiness for and disposition
   unto this duty in private and public, according to its proper seasons.

   2dly. In its progress, unto unreadiness it will add unwillingness; for
   the mind prepossessed by sin finds it directly contrary unto its
   present interest, disposition, and inclination. There is nothing in it
   but what troubles and disquiets them; as he said of the prophet who was
   not willing to hear him any more, it speaks not good but evil of them
   continually. Hence a secret unwillingness prevails in the mind, and an
   aversation from a serious engagement in it; and the attendance of such
   persons to it is as if they were under a force, in a compliance with
   custom and convictions.

   3dly. Sin will at length prevail unto a total neglect of this duty.
   This is an observation confirmed by long experience: If prayer do not
   constantly endeavour the ruin of sin, sin will ruin prayer, and utterly
   alienate the soul from it. This is the way of backsliders in heart; as
   they grow in sin they decay in prayer, until they are weary of it and
   utterly relinquish it. So they speak, Mal. i. 13, "Behold, what a
   weariness is it!" and, "Ye have snuffed at it." They look on it as a
   task, as a burden, and are weary in attending unto it.

   Now, when I place this as an effect of the prevalency of sin, --
   namely, a relinquishment of the duty of prayer, -- I do not intend that
   persons do wholly and absolutely, or as to all ways of it, public and
   private, and all seasons or occasions of it, give it over utterly. Few
   rise to that profligacy in sin, unto such desperate resolution against
   God. It may be they will still attend unto the stated seasons of prayer
   in families or public assemblies, at least drawing near to God with
   their lips; and they will, on surprisals and dangers, personally cry
   unto God, as the Scripture everywhere testifieth of them. But this only
   I intend, -- namely, that they will no more sincerely, immediately, and
   directly, apply prayer to the mortification and ruin of that lust or
   corruption wherein sin puts forth its power and rule in them; and where
   it is so, it seems to have the dominion. Of such an one saith the
   psalmist, "He hath left off to be wise, and to do good. He setteth
   himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil," Ps. xxxvi.
   3, 4.

   But such a relinquishment of this duty, as unto the end mentioned, as
   is habitual, and renders the soul secure under it, is intended; for
   there may, through the power of temptation, be a prevalency of this
   evil in believers for a season. So God complains of his people, Isa.
   xliii. 22, "Thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
   weary of me, O Israel;" that is, comparatively, as unto the fervency
   and sincerity of the duty required of them. Now, when it is thus with
   believers for a season, through the power of sin and temptation, --
   (1st.) They do not approve of themselves therein. They will ever and
   anon call things to consideration, and say, "It is not with us as it
   should be, or as it was in former days. This thing is not good that we
   do, nor will it be peace in the latter end." (2dly.) They will have
   secret resolutions of shaking themselves out of the dust of this evil
   state. They say in themselves, "We will go and return unto our first
   husband, for then was it better with us than now;" as the church did,
   Hosea ii. 7. (3dly.) Every thing that peculiarly befalls them, in a way
   of mercy or affliction, they look on as calls from God to deliver and
   recover them from their backsliding frame. (4thly.) They will receive
   in the warnings which are given them by the word preached, especially
   if their particular case be touched on or laid open. (5thly.) They will
   have no quiet, rest, or self-approbation, until they come thoroughly
   off unto a healing and recovery, such as that described, Hosea xiv.
   1-4.

   Thus it may be with some over whom sin hath not the dominion; yet ought
   the first entrance of it to be diligently watched against, as that
   which tends unto the danger and ruin of the soul.

   Thirdly, Constant self-abasement, condemnation, and abhorrency, is
   another duty that is directly opposed unto the interest and rule of sin
   in the soul. No frame of mind is a better antidote against the poison
   of sin. "He that walketh humbly walketh surely." [4] God hath a
   continual regard unto mourners, those that are of a "broken heart and a
   contrite spirit." It is the soil where all grace will thrive and
   flourish. A constant due sense of sin as sin, of our interest therein
   by nature and in the course of our lives, with a continual afflictive
   remembrance of some such instances of it as have had peculiar
   aggravations, issuing in a gracious self-abasement, is the soul's best
   posture in watching against all the deceits and incursions of sin. And
   this is a duty which we ought with all diligence to attend unto. To
   keep our souls in a constant frame of mourning and self-abasement is
   the most necessary part of our wisdom with reference unto all the ends
   of the life of God; and it is so far from having any inconsistency with
   those consolations and joys which the gospel tenders unto us in
   believing, as that it is the only way to let them into the soul in a
   due manner. It is such mourners, and those alone, unto whom evangelical
   comforts are administered, Isa. lvii. 18.

   One of the first things that sin doth when it aims at dominion is the
   destruction of this frame of mind; and when it actually hath the rule,
   it will not suffer it to enter. It makes men careless and regardless of
   this matter, yea, bold, presumptuous, and fearless; it will obstruct
   all the entrance into the mind of such self-reflections and
   considerations as lead unto this frame; it will represent them either
   as needless or unseasonable, or make the mind afraid of them, as things
   which tend unto its disquietment and disturbance without any advantage.
   If it prevail herein, it makes way for the security of its own
   dominion. Nothing is more watched against than a proud, regardless,
   senseless, secure frame of heart, by them who are under the rule of
   grace.

   4. A reserve for any one known sin, against the light and efficacy of
   convictions, is an argument of the dominion of sin. So was it in the
   case of Naaman. He would do all other things, but put in an exception
   for that whereon his honour and profit did depend. Where there is
   sincerity in conviction, it extends itself unto all sins; for it is of
   sin as sin, and so of every known sin equally, that hath the nature of
   sin in it. And to be true to convictions is the life of sincerity. If
   men can make a choice of what they will except and reserve,
   notwithstanding their being convinced of its evil, it is from the
   ruling power of sin. Pleas in the mind in the behalf of any sin, that
   is, for a continuance in it, prevalent thereunto, ruin all sincerity.
   It may be the pretence is that it is but a little one, of no great
   moment, and that which shall be compensated with other duties of
   obedience; or it shall be retained only until a fitter season for its
   relinquishment; or men may be blinded after conviction to dispute again
   whether what they would abide in be sinful or no, as is the case
   frequently with respect unto covetousness, pride, and conformity to the
   world. It is a dreadful effect of the ruling power of sin. Whatever
   impeacheth the universality of obedience in one thing overthrows its
   sincerity in all things.

   5. Hardness of heart, so frequently mentioned and complained of in the
   Scripture, is another evidence of the dominion of sin. But because
   there are various degrees also hereof, they must be considered, that we
   may judge aright what of it is an evidence of that dominion, and what
   may be consistent with the rule of grace; for it is that mysterious
   evil whereof the best men do most complain, and whereof the worst have
   no sense at all.

Chapter IV.

   Hardness of heart spoken to as an eminent sign of sin's dominion; and
   it is shown that it ought to be considered as total or partial.

   Hardness of heart is either total and absolute, or partial and
   comparative only.

   Total hardness is either natural and universal, or judiciary in some
   particular individuals.

   Natural hardness is the blindness or obstinacy of the heart in sin by
   nature, which is not to be cured by the use or application of any
   outward means: "Hardness and impenitent heart," Rom. ii. 5. This is
   that heart of stone which God promises in the covenant to take away by
   the efficacy of his almighty grace, Ezek. xxxvi. 26. Where this
   hardness abides uncured, unremoved, there sin is absolutely in the
   throne. This, therefore, we do not inquire about.

   Judiciary hardness is either immediately from God, or it is by the
   devil through his permission.

   In the first way, God is frequently said to harden the hearts of men in
   their sins and unto their ruin; as he did with Pharaoh, Exod. iv. 21.
   And he doth it in general two ways:-- 1. By withholding from them those
   supplies of light, wisdom, and understanding, without which they cannot
   understand their condition, see their danger, or avoid their ruin. 2.
   By withholding the efficacy of the means which they enjoy for their
   conviction and repentance, yea, and giving them an efficacy unto their
   obduration, Isa. vi. 9, 10. And concerning this divine induration we
   may observe, --

   1. That it is the severest of divine punishments in this world. 2. That
   therefore it is not executed but towards those that are habitually
   wicked, and so do of choice harden themselves in their sins, Rom. i.
   26, 28. 3. For the most part it respects some especial times and
   seasons, wherein are the turning-points for eternity. 4. That the
   condition of those so hardened is remediless, and their wounds
   incurable.

   Where any are thus hardened, there is no question about the dominion of
   sin. Such a heart is its throne, its proper seat, next to hell.

   Secondly, There is a judiciary hardness which Satan, through God's
   permission, brings on men, 2 Cor. iv. 4; and there are many ways
   whereby he doth effect it, not here to be insisted on.

   But there is a hardness of heart that is indeed but partial and
   comparative, whatever appearance it may make of that which is total and
   absolute; whence the inquiry ariseth whether it be an evidence of the
   dominion of sin or no.

   There is a hardness of heart which is known and lamented by them in
   whom it is. Hereof the church complains, Isa. lxiii. 17, "O Lord, why
   hast thou hardened our heart from thy fear?" or, "suffered it so to be,
   not healing, not recovering our hardness." And there are sundry things
   which concur in this kind of hardness of heart; as, --

   1. Want of readiness to receive divine impressions from the word of
   God. When the heart is soft and tender, it is also humble and contrite,
   and ready to tremble at the word of God. So it is said of Josiah that
   "his heart was tender," and "he humbled himself before the Lord," when
   he heard his word, 2 Kings xxii. 18, 19. This may be wanting in some in
   a great measure, and they may be sensible of it. They may find in
   themselves a great unreadiness to comply with divine warnings,
   reproofs, calls. They are not affected with the word preached, but
   sometimes complain that they sit under it like stocks and stones. They
   have not an experience of its power, and are not cast into the mould of
   it. Hereon they apprehend that their hearts are hardened from the fear
   of God, as the church complains. There is, indeed, no better frame of
   heart to be attained in this life than that whereby it is to the word
   as the wax to the seal, fit and ready to receive impressions from it,
   -- a frame that is tender to receive the communications of the word in
   all their variety, whether for reproof, instruction, or consolation;
   and the want hereof is a culpable hardness of heart.

   2. There belongs unto it an [un]affectedness with the guilt of sin, as
   unto the sorrow and repentance that it doth require. There is none in
   whom there is any spark of saving grace but hath a gracious sorrow for
   sin, in some degree or other. But there is a proportion required
   between sin and sorrow. Great sins require great sorrows, as Peter, on
   his great sin, "wept bitterly;" and all especial aggravations of sin
   require an especial sense of them. This the soul finds not in itself.
   It bears the thoughts of sin and the rebukes of conscience without any
   great concussion or remorse; it can pass over the charge of sin without
   relenting, mourning, dissolving in sighs and tears; and it cannot but
   say sometimes thereon that its heart is like the adamant or the flint
   in the rock. This makes many fear that they are under the dominion of
   sin; and they fear it the more because that fear doth not affect and
   humble them as it ought. And it must be granted that all unaffectedness
   with sin, all want of humiliation and godly sorrow upon it, is from an
   undue hardness of heart; and they who are not affected with it have
   great reason to be jealous over themselves, even as unto their
   spiritual state and condition.

   3. Of the same kind, in its measure, is unaffectedness with the sins of
   others among whom we live, or in whom we are concerned. To mourn for
   the sins of others is a duty highly approved of God, Ezek. ix. 4. It
   argues the effectual working of many graces, as zeal for the glory of
   God, compassion for the souls of men, love to the glory and interest of
   Christ in the world. The want hereof is from hardness of heart; and it
   is that which abounds among us. Some find not themselves at all
   concerned herein; some make pretences why they need not so be, or that
   it is not their duty, -- what is it unto them how wicked the world is?
   it shall answer for its own sins. Nor are they moved when it comes
   nearer them. If their children come to losses, poverty, ruin, then they
   are affected indeed; but so long as they flourish in the world, be they
   apostates from profession, be they enemies to Christ, do they avowedly
   belong unto the world and walk in the ways of it, they are not much
   concerned, especially if they are not scandalously profligate. But this
   also is from hardness of heart, which will be bewailed where grace is
   vigilant and active.

   4. Want of a due sense of indications of divine displeasure is another
   instance of this hardness of heart. God doth ofttimes give signs and
   tokens hereof, whether as unto the public state of the church in the
   world, or as unto our own persons, in afflictions and chastisements. In
   the seasons hereof he expects that our hearts should be soft and
   tender, ready to receive impressions of his anger, and pliable therein
   unto his mind and will. There are none whom at such a time he doth more
   abhor than those who are stout-hearted, little regarding him or the
   operation of his hands. This in some measure may be in believers, and
   they may be sensible of it, to their sorrow and humiliation.

   These things, and many more of the like nature, proceed from hardness
   of heart, or the remainder of our hardness by nature, and are great
   promoters of the interest of sin in us. But where any persons are
   sensible of this frame, where they are humbled for it, where they mourn
   under, and cry out for its removal, it is so far from being an evidence
   of the dominion of sin over them in whom it is, that it is an eminent
   sign of the contrary, -- namely, that the ruling power of sin is
   certainly broken and destroyed in the soul.

   But there are other instances of hardness of heart, which have much
   more difficulty in them, and which are hardly reconcilable unto the
   rule of grace. I shall mention some of them:--

   1. Security and senselessness under the guilt of great actual sins. I
   do not say this is, or can at any time be, absolute in any believer;
   but such it may be as whereon men may go on at their old pace of duties
   and profession, though without any peculiar humiliation, albeit they
   are under the provoking guilt of some known sin, with its aggravations.
   It will recur upon their minds, and conscience, unless it be seared,
   will treat with them about it; but they pass it over, as that which
   they had rather forget and wear out of their minds than bring things
   unto their proper issue by particular repentance. So it seems to have
   been with David after his sin with Bathsheba. I doubt not but that
   before the message of God to him by Nathan, he had unpleasing thoughts
   of what he had done; but there are not the least footsteps in the story
   or any of his prayers that he laid it seriously to heart and was
   humbled for it before. This was a great hardness of heart; and we know
   how difficult his recovery from it was. He was saved, but as through
   fire. And where it is so with any one that hath been overtaken with any
   great sin, as drunkenness or other folly, that he strives to wear it
   out, to pass it over, to forget it, or give himself countenance from
   any reasoning or consideration against the especial sense of it and
   humiliation for it, he can, during that state and frame, have no solid
   evidence that sin hath not the dominion in him. And let such sinners be
   warned who have so passed over former sins until they have utterly lost
   all sense of them, or are under such a frame at present, that they
   recall things to another account, and suffer no such sin to pass
   without a peculiar humiliation, or, whatever be the final issue of
   things with them, they can have no solid ground of spiritual peace in
   this world.

   2. There is such a dangerous hardness of heart, where the guilt of one
   sin makes not the soul watchful against another of another sort.
   Wherever the heart is tender, upon a surprisal into sin, it will not
   only watch against the returns thereof or relapses into it, but will be
   made diligent, heedful, and careful against all other sins whatever. So
   is it with all that walk humbly under a sense of sin. But when men
   [are] in such a state [they] are careless, bold, and negligent, so as
   that if they repeat not the same sin, they are easily hurried into
   others. Thus was it with Asa. He was "wroth with the seer" that came
   unto him with a divine message, and smote him, "and put him in a prison
   house, for he was in a rage," 2 Chron. xvi. 10. A man would think that
   when he was recovered out of this distemper, it might have made him
   humble and watchful against other sins; but it was not so, for it is
   added that he "oppressed some of the people at the same time." And he
   rested not there, but "in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to
   the physicians," verse 12. Unto persecution he added oppression, and
   unto that unbelief. Yet, notwithstanding all this, "Asa's heart was
   perfect with the Lord all his days," 1 Kings xv. 14; that is, he had a
   prevalent sincerity in him notwithstanding these miscarriages. But he
   was, doubtless, under the power of great hardness of heart. So is it
   with others in the like cases, when one sin makes them not careful and
   watchful against another; as when men have stained themselves with
   intemperance of life, they may fall into excess of passion with their
   families and relations, or into a neglect of duty, take any other
   crooked steps in their walk. This argues a great prevalency of sin in
   the soul, although, as we see in the example of Asa, it is not an
   infallible evidence of its dominion; yet of that nature it is wherewith
   divine peace and consolation are inconsistent.

   3. When men fall into such unspiritual frames, such deadness and
   decays, as from which they are not recoverable by the ordinary means of
   grace, it is a certain evidence of hardness of heart and the prevalency
   of sin therein. It is so, whether this be the fault of churches or of
   particular persons. The preaching of the word is the especial divine
   ordinance for the healing and recovery of backsliders in heart or life.
   Where this will not effect it in any, but they will go on frowardly in
   the ways of their own hearts, unless God take some extraordinary course
   with them, they are on the brink of ruin, and live on sovereign grace
   alone.

   Thus was it with David. After his great sin, there is no doubt but he
   attended unto all ordinances of divine worship, which are the ordinary
   means of the preservation and recovery of sinners from their
   backslidings. Howbeit they had not this effect upon him. He lived
   impenitently in his sin, until God was pleased to use extraordinary
   means, in the especial message of Nathan and the death of his child,
   for his awakening and recovery.

   And thus God will deal sometimes with churches and persons. Where
   ordinary means for their recovery will not effect it, he will by
   sovereign grace, and it may be by a concurrence of extraordinary
   providences, heal, revive, and save them. So he promiseth to do, Isa.
   lvii. 16-19.

   But where this is trusted unto, in the neglect of the ordinary means of
   healing, seeing there is no direct promise of it, but it is a case
   reserved unto absolute sovereignty, the end may be bitterness and
   sorrow.

   And let them take heed who are under this frame; for although God may
   deliver them, yet it will be by "terrible things," as Ps. lxv. 5, --
   such terrible things as wherein he will "take vengeance of their
   inventions," Ps. xcix. 8, though he do forgive them. So David affirms
   of himself, that God in his dealing with him had broken all his bones,
   Ps. li. 8.

   I fear this is the present case of many churches and professors at this
   day. It is evident that they are fallen under many spiritual decays;
   neither have the ordinary means of grace, repentance, and humiliation,
   though backed with various providential warnings, been efficacious to
   their recovery. It is greatly to be feared that God will use some
   severe dispensation in terrible things towards them for their
   awakening, or, which is more dreadful, withdraw his presence from them.

   4. Of the same nature it is, and argues no small power of this evil,
   when men satisfy and please themselves in an unmortified, unfruitful
   profession; a severe symptom of the dominion of sin. And there are
   three things that manifest the consistency of such a profession with
   hardness of heart, or are fruits of it therein:--

   (1.) A neglect of the principal duties of it. Such are mortification in
   themselves, and usefulness or fruitfulness towards others. A deficiency
   and neglect in these things are evident amongst many that profess
   religion. It doth not appear that in any thing they seriously endeavour
   the mortification of their lusts, their pride, their passion, their
   love of the world, their inordinate desires and sensual appetites. They
   either indulge unto them all, or at least they maintain not a constant
   conflict against them. And as unto usefulness in the fruits of
   righteousness, which are to the praise of God by Jesus Christ, or those
   good works which are the evidence of a living faith, they are openly
   barren in them. Now, whereas these are the principal dictates of that
   religion which they do profess, their neglect of them, their deficiency
   in them, proceed from a hardness of heart, overpowering their light and
   convictions. And what shall long, in such a case, stop sin out of the
   throne? Self-pleasing and satisfaction in such a profession argues a
   very dangerous state and habit of mind. Sin may have a full dominion
   under such a profession.

   (2.) The admission of an habitual formality into the performance of
   religious duties is of the same nature. In some the power of sin, as we
   observed before, prevails unto the neglect and omission of such duties.
   Others continue the observation [of them], but are so formal and
   lifeless in them, so careless as unto the exerting or exercise of grace
   in them, as gives an uncontrollable evidence of the power of sin and a
   spiritual senselessness of heart. There is nothing that the Scripture
   doth more frequently and severely condemn, and give as a character of
   hypocrites, than a diligent attendance unto a multiplication of duties
   whilst the heart is not spiritually engaged in them. For this cause the
   Lord Christ threatened the utter rejection of the lukewarm church of
   Laodicea; and God pronounceth a most severe sentence against all that
   are guilty of it, Isa. xxix. 13, 14. Yet thus it may be with many, and
   that thus it hath been with them many do manifest by their open
   apostasy, which is the common event of this frame and course long
   continued in; for some in the daily performance of religious duties for
   a season do exercise and preserve their gifts, but, there being no
   exercise of grace in them, after a while those gifts also do wither and
   decay. They are under the power of the evil whereof we treat, --
   namely, a hard and senseless heart, -- that can approve of themselves
   in such a lifeless, heartless profession of religion, and performance
   of the duties thereof.

   (3.) When men grow senseless under the dispensation of the word, and do
   not at all profit by it. The general ends of preaching the word unto
   believers are:-- [1.] The increase of spiritual light, knowledge, and
   understanding, in them; [2.] The growth of grace, enabling to
   obedience; [3.] Holy excitation of grace, by impressions of its power
   in the communication of the mind, will, love, and grace of God, unto
   our souls; -- which is attended with, [4.] An impression on the
   affections, renewing and making them more holy and heavenly
   continually; with, [5.] Direction and administration of spiritual
   strength against temptations and corruptions; and, [6.] Fruitfulness in
   the works and duties of obedience.

   Where men can abide under the dispensation of the word without any of
   these effects on their minds, consciences, or lives, they are greatly
   hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, as in Heb. iii. 12, 13, this case
   is stated. Now, whether this be, -- [1.] From that carelessness and
   security which is grown on all sorts of persons, against which God doth
   justly express his indignation, by withholding the power and efficacy
   of his word in its administration from them; or, [2.] From an increase
   of an unsanctified light and gifts, which fill men with high thoughts
   of themselves, and keep them off from that humble frame which alone is
   teachable; or, [3.] From a loss of all due reverence unto the ministry
   as God's ordinance for all the ends of the word, with a secret
   fortification of conscience by prejudices against its power, from the
   suggestions of Satan; or, [4.] From the love of sin, which the heart
   would shelter and secure from the efficacy of the word; or from what
   other cause soever it be, -- it proceeds from a dangerous hardness of
   heart, from the power of sin.

   Where this is the state of the minds of men, where this hardness is
   thus prevalent in them, I do not, no man can, give them assurance that
   sin hath not the dominion in them; but because all these things are
   capable of various degrees, it may not be concluded absolutely from any
   or all of them, in any degree, that so it is. But this we may safely
   conclude, -- 1. That it is impossible for any man in whom this evil
   frame is found in any degree, and not sincerely endeavoured against, to
   keep any true solid peace with God or in his own soul; what seems to be
   so in him is but a ruinous security. 2. That this is the high road unto
   final obduration and impenitency. And therefore, 3. It is the present
   duty of those who have any care of their souls to shake themselves out
   of this dust, and not to give themselves any rest until they are
   entered into the paths of recovery. The calls of God unto such
   backsliders in heart for a return are multiplied; the reasons for it
   and motives unto it are innumerable. This ought never to depart from
   their minds, that without it they shall eternally perish, and they know
   not how soon they may be overtaken with that destruction.

   Thus far have we proceeded in the inquiry, whether sin hath the
   dominion in us or no. There are on the other side many evidences of the
   rule of grace, sufficient to discard the pleas and pretences of sin
   unto the throne; but the consideration of them is not my present
   design. I have only examined the pleas of sin which render the inquiry
   difficult and the case dubious; and they arise all from the actings of
   sin in us as it fights against the soul, which is its proper and
   constant work, 1 Pet. ii. 11. It doth so against the design of the law,
   which is to live to God; against the order and peace of it, which it
   disturbs; and against its eternal blessedness, which it would deprive
   it of. The examination of the pretences insisted on may be of some use
   to them that are sincere.

   But, on the other hand, there are uncontrollable evidences of the
   dominion of sin in men, some whereof I shall mention, and only mention,
   because they need neither proof nor illustration:--

   1. It is so where sin hath possessed the will. And it hath possessed
   the will when there are no restraints from sinning taken from its
   nature, but from its consequents only. 2. When men proclaim their sins
   and hide them not, -- when they boast in them and of them, as it is
   with multitudes; or, 3. Approve of themselves in any known sin, without
   renewed repentance, as drunkenness, uncleanness, swearing, and the
   like; or, 4. Live in the neglect of religious duties in their closets
   and families, whence all their public attendance unto them is but
   hypocrisy; or, 5. Have an enmity to true holiness and the power of
   godliness; or, 6. Are visible apostates from profession, especially if
   they add, as is usual, persecution to their apostasy; or, 7. Are
   ignorant of the sanctifying principles of the gospel and Christian
   religion; or, 8. Are despisers of the means of conversion; or, 9. Live
   in security under open providential warnings and calls to repentance;
   or, 10. Are enemies in their minds unto the true interest of Christ in
   the world. Where these things and the like are found, there is no
   question what it is that hath dominion and bears rule in the minds of
   men. This all men may easily know, as the apostle declares, Rom. vi.
   16.

Chapter V.

   The third inquiry handled, namely, What is the assurance given us, and
   what are the grounds thereof, that sin shall not have dominion over us
   -- The ground of this assurance is, that we are "not under the law, but
   under grace" -- The force of this reason shown, namely, How the law
   doth not destroy the dominion of sin, and how grace dethrones sin and
   gives dominion over it.

   III. And thus much hath been spoken unto the second thing proposed at
   the entrance of this discourse, -- namely, an inquiry, Whether sin have
   the dominion in any of us or no. I proceed unto that which offers
   itself from the words, in the third place: What is the assurance given
   us, and what are the grounds of it, that sin shall not have dominion
   over us; which lies in this, that we are "not under the law, but under
   grace."

   Where men are engaged in a constant conflict against sin; where they
   look upon it and judge it their chiefest enemy, which contends with
   them for their souls and their eternal ruin; where they have experience
   of its power and deceit, and through the efficacy of them have been
   often shaken in their peace and comfort; where they have been ready to
   despond, and say they shall one day perish under their powers, -- it is
   a gospel word, a word of good tidings, that gives them assurance that
   it shall never have dominion over them.

   The ground of this assurance is, that believers are "not under the law,
   but under grace." And the force of this reason we may manifest in some
   few instances:--

   First, The law giveth no strength against sin unto them that are under
   it, but grace doth. Sin will neither be cast nor kept out of its
   throne, but by a spiritual power and strength in the soul to oppose,
   conquer, and dethrone it. Where it is not conquered it will reign; and
   conquered it will not be without a mighty prevailing power: this the
   law will not, cannot give.

   The law is taken two ways:-- 1. For the whole revelation of the mind
   and will of God in the Old Testament. In this sense it had grace in it,
   and so did give both life, and light, and strength against sin, as the
   psalmist declares, Ps. xix. 7-9. In this sense it contained not only
   the law of precepts, but the promise also and the covenant, which was
   the means of conveying spiritual life and strength unto the church. In
   this sense it is not here spoken of, nor is anywhere opposed unto
   grace. 2. For the covenant rule of perfect obedience: "Do this, and
   live." In this sense men are said to be "under it," in opposition unto
   being "under grace." They are under its power, rule, conditions, and
   authority, as a covenant. And in this sense all men are under it who
   are not instated in the new covenant through faith in Christ Jesus, who
   sets up in them and over them the rule of grace; for all men must be
   one way or other under the rule of God, and he rules only by the law or
   by grace, and none can be under both at the same time.

   In this sense the law was never ordained of God to convey grace or
   spiritual strength unto the souls of men; had it been so, the promise
   and the gospel had been needless: "If there had been a law given which
   could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the
   law," Gal. iii. 21. If it could have given life or strength, it would
   have produced righteousness, we should have been justified by it. It
   discovers sin and condemns it, but gives no strength to oppose it. It
   is not God's ordinance for the dethroning of sin, nor for the
   destruction of its dominion.

   This law falls under a double consideration, but in neither of them was
   designed to give power or strength against sin:--

   1. As it was given unto mankind in the state of innocency; and it did
   then absolutely and exactly declare the whole duty of man, whatever God
   in his wisdom and holiness did require of us. It was God's ruling of
   man according to the principle of the righteousness wherein he was
   created. But it gave no new aids against sin; nor was there any need
   that so it should do. It was not the ordinance of God to administer new
   or more grace unto man, but to rule and govern him according to what he
   had received; and this it continueth to do forever. It claims and
   continues a rule over all men, according to what they had and what they
   have; but it never had power to bar the entrance of sin, nor to cast it
   out when it is once enthroned.

   2. As it was renewed and enjoined unto the church of Israel on Mount
   Sinai, and with them unto all that would join themselves unto the Lord
   out of the nations of the world. Yet neither was it then, nor as such,
   designed unto any such end as to destroy or dethrone sin by an
   administration of spiritual strength and grace. It had some new ends
   given then unto it, which it had not in its original constitution, the
   principal whereof was to drive men to the promise, and Christ therein;
   and this it doth by all the acts and powers of it on the souls of men.
   As it discovers sin, as it irritates and provokes it by its severity,
   as it judgeth and condemneth it, as it denounceth a curse on sinners,
   it drives unto this end; for this was added of grace in the renovation
   of it, this new end was given unto it. In itself it hath nothing to do
   with sinners, but to judge, curse, and condemn them.

   There is, therefore, no help to be expected against the dominion of sin
   from the law. It was never ordained of God unto that end; nor doth it
   contain, nor is it communicative of, the grace necessary unto that end,
   Rom. viii. 3.

   Wherefore, those who are "under the law" are under the dominion of sin.
   "The law is holy," but it cannot make them holy who have made
   themselves unholy; it is "just," but it cannot make them so, -- it
   cannot justify them whom it doth condemn; it is "good," but can do them
   no good, as unto their deliverance from the power of sin. God hath not
   appointed it unto that end. Sin will never be dethroned by it; it will
   not give place unto the law, neither in its title nor its power.

   Those who are under the law will at some seasons endeavour to shake off
   the yoke of sin, and resolve to be no longer under its power; as, --

   1. When the law presseth on their consciences, perplexing and
   disquieting them. The commandment comes home unto them, sin reviveth,
   and they die, Rom. vii. 9, 10; that is, it gives power to sin to slay
   the hopes of the sinner, and to distress him with the apprehension of
   guilt and death: for "the strength of sin is the law," 1 Cor. xv. 56;
   -- the power it hath to disquiet and condemn sinners is in and by the
   law. When it is thus with sinners, when the law presseth them with a
   sense of the guilt of sin, and deprives them of all rest and peace in
   their minds, they will resolve to cast off the yoke of sin, to
   relinquish its service, that they may be freed from the urgency of the
   law on their consciences; and they will endeavour it in some instances
   of duty and abstinence from sin.

   2. They will do the same under surprisals with sickness, pain, dangers,
   or death itself. Then they will cry, and pray, and promise to reform,
   and set about it, as they suppose, in good earnest. This case is fully
   exemplified, Ps. lxxviii. 34-37; and it is manifest in daily experience
   amongst multitudes. There are few who are so seared and profligate but
   at such seasons they will think of returning to God, of relinquishing
   the service of sin, and vindicating themselves from under its dominion.
   And in some it worketh a lasting change, though no real conversion doth
   ensue; but with the most this "goodness is as a morning cloud, and as
   the early dew it goeth away."

   3. The same effect is produced in many by the preaching of the word.
   Some arrow of conviction is fastened in their minds, whereon their
   former ways displease them, and they judge it is better for them to
   change the course of their lives, and to relinquish the service of sin.
   These resolutions for the most part abide with them according to the
   society which they have or fall into. Good society may much help them
   in their resolves for a time, when by that which is evil and corrupt
   they are presently extinguished.

   4. Sometimes merciful, endearing providences will have the same effect
   on the minds of men not obdurate in sin. Such are deliverances from
   imminent dangers, sparing the lives of near relations, and the like.

   In such seasons, men under the law will attend unto their convictions,
   and endeavour for a while to shake off the yoke of sin. They will
   attend unto what the law saith, under whose power they are, and
   endeavour a compliance therewith; many duties shall be performed, and
   many evils abstained from, in order to the quitting themselves of sin's
   dominion. But, alas! the law cannot enable them hereunto, -- it cannot
   give them life and strength to go through with what their convictions
   press them unto; therefore, after a while they begin to faint and wax
   weary in their progress, and at length give quite over. It may be they
   may break off from some great sins in particular, but shake off the
   whole dominion of sin they cannot.

   It is otherwise with them that are "under grace." Sin shall not have
   dominion over them; strength shall be administered unto them to
   dethrone it.

   "Grace" is a word of various acceptations in the Scripture. As we are
   here said to be under it, and as it is opposed unto the law, it is used
   or taken for the gospel, as it is the instrument of God for the
   communication of himself and his grace by Jesus Christ unto those that
   do believe, with that state of acceptation with himself which they are
   brought into thereby, Rom. v. 1, 2. Wherefore, to be "under grace" is
   to have an interest in the gospel covenant and state, with a right unto
   all the privileges and benefits thereof, to be brought under the
   administration of grace by Jesus Christ, -- to be a true believer.

   But the inquiry hereon is, how it follows from hence that sin shall not
   have dominion over us, that sin cannot extend its territories and rule
   into that state, and in what sense this is affirmed.

   1. Is it that there shall be no sin in them any more? Even this is true
   in some sense. Sin as unto its condemning power hath no place in this
   state, Rom. viii. 1. All the sins of them that believe are expiated or
   done away, as to the guilt of them, in the blood of Christ, Heb. i. 3,
   1 John i. 7. This branch of the dominion of sin, which consists in its
   condemning power, is utterly cast out of this state. But sin as unto
   its being and operation doth still continue in believers whilst they
   are in this world; they are all sensible of it. Those who deceive
   themselves with a contrary apprehension are most of all under the power
   of it, 1 John i. 8. Wherefore, to be freed from the dominion of sin is
   not to be freed absolutely from all sin, so as that it should in no
   sense abide in us any more. This is not to be under grace, but to be in
   glory.

   2. Is it that sin, though it abides, yet it shall not fight or contend
   for dominion in us? That this is otherwise we have before declared.
   Scripture and the universal experience of all that believe do testify
   the contrary; so doth the assurance here given us that it shall not
   obtain that dominion: for if it did not contend for it, there could be
   no grace in this promise, -- there is none in deliverance from that
   whereof we are in no danger.

   But the assurance here given is built on other considerations; whereof
   the first is, that the gospel is the means ordained and instrument used
   by God for the communication of spiritual strength unto them that
   believe, for the dethroning of sin. It is the "power of God unto
   salvation," Rom. i. 16, that whereby and wherein he puts forth his
   power unto that end. And sin must be really dethroned by the powerful
   acting of grace in us, and that in a way of duty in ourselves. We are
   absolved, quitted, freed from the rule of sin, as unto its pretended
   right and title, by the promise of the gospel; for thereby are we freed
   and discharged from the rule of the law, wherein all the title of sin
   unto dominion is founded, for "the strength of sin is the law:" but we
   are freed from it, as unto its internal power and exercise of its
   dominion, by internal spiritual grace and strength in its due exercise.
   Now, this is communicated by the gospel; it gives life and power, with
   such continual supplies of grace as are able to dethrone sin, and
   forever to prohibit its return.

   This, then, is the present case supposed and determined by the apostle:
   "You that are believers are all of you conflicting with sin. You find
   it always restless and disquieting, sometimes strong and powerful. When
   it is in conjunction with any urgent temptation, you are afraid it will
   utterly prevail over you, to the ruin of your souls. Hence you are
   wearied with it, groan under it, and cry out for deliverance from it."
   All these things the apostle at large insists on in this and the next
   chapter. "But now," saith he, "be of good comfort; notwithstanding all
   these things, and all your fears upon them, sin shall not prevail, it
   shall not have the dominion, it shall never ruin your souls." But what
   ground have we for this hope? what assurance of this success? "This you
   have," saith the apostle, "?Ye are not under the law, but under grace;'
   or the rule of the grace of God in Christ Jesus, administered in the
   gospel." But how doth this give relief? "Why, it is the ordinance, the
   instrument of God, which he will use unto this end -- namely, the
   communication of such supplies of grace and spiritual strength as shall
   eternally defeat the dominion of sin."

   This is one principal difference between the law and the gospel, and
   was ever so esteemed in the church of God, until all communication of
   efficacious grace began to be called in question: The law guides,
   directs, commands, all things that are against the interest and rule of
   sin. It judgeth and condemneth both the things that promote it and the
   persons that do them; it frightens and terrifies the consciences of
   those who are under its dominion. But if you shall say unto it, "What
   then shall we do? this tyrant, this enemy, is too hard for us. What aid
   and assistance against it will you afford unto us? what power will you
   communicate unto its destruction?" Here the law is utterly silent, or
   says that nothing of this nature is committed unto it of God; nay, the
   strength it hath it gives unto sin for the condemnation of the sinner:
   "The strength of sin is the law." But the gospel, or the grace of it,
   is the means and instrument of God for the communication of internal
   spiritual strength unto believers. By it do they receive supplies of
   the Spirit or aids of grace for the subduing of sin and the destruction
   of its dominion. By it they may say they can do all things, through Him
   that enables them.

   Hereon then depends, in the first place, the assurance of the apostle's
   assertion, that "sin shall not have dominion over us," because we are
   "under grace." We are in such a state as wherein we have supplies in
   readiness to defeat all the attempts of sin for rule and dominion in
   us.

   But some may say hereon, they greatly fear they are not in this state,
   for they do not find such supplies of spiritual strength and grace as
   to give them a conquest over sin. They are still perplexed with it, and
   it is ready to invade the throne in their minds, if it be not already
   possessed of it. Wherefore they fear lest they are strangers from the
   grace of the gospel.

   In answer hereunto the things ensuing are proposed:--

   1. Remember what hath been declared concerning the dominion of sin. If
   it be not known what it is and wherein it doth consist, as some may
   please themselves whilst their condition is deplorable (as it is with
   the most), so others may be perplexed in their minds without just
   cause. A clear distinction between the rebellion of sin and the
   dominion of sin is a great advantage unto spiritual peace.

   2. Consider the end for which aids of grace are granted and
   communicated by the gospel. Now, this is not that sin may at once be
   utterly destroyed and consumed in us, that it should have no being,
   motion, or power in us any more. This work is reserved for glory, in
   the full redemption of body and soul, which we here do but groan after.
   But it is given unto us for this end, that sin may be so crucified and
   mortified in us, -- that is, so gradually weakened and destroyed, -- as
   that it shall not ruin spiritual life in us, or obstruct its necessary
   acting in duties, and for prevalency against such sins as would
   disannul the covenant relation between God and our souls. Whilst we
   have supplies of it which are sufficient unto this end, although our
   conflict with sin doth continue, although we are perplexed by it, yet
   we are under grace, and sin shall have no more dominion over us. This
   is enough for us, that sin shall be gradually destroyed, and we shall
   have a sufficiency of grace on all occasions to prevent its ruling
   prevalency.

   3. Live in the faith of this sacred truth, and ever keep alive in your
   souls expectation of supplies of grace suitable thereunto. It is of the
   nature of true and saving faith, inseparable from it, to believe that
   the gospel is the way of God's administration of grace for the ruin of
   sin. He that believes it not believes not the gospel itself, which is
   "the power of God unto salvation," Rom. i. 16. If we live, and walk,
   and act, as if we had nothing to trust unto but ourselves, our own
   endeavours, our own resolutions, and that in our perplexities and
   surprisals, it is no wonder if we are not sensible of supplies of
   divine grace; -- most probably we are under the law, and not under
   grace. This is the fundamental principle of the gospel state, that we
   live in expectation of continual communications of life, grace, and
   strength, from Jesus Christ, who is "our life," and from whose "fulness
   we receive, and grace for grace." We may therefore, in this case,
   continually expostulate with our souls, as David doth: "Why go you
   mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? Why are you cast down?
   and why are you disquieted within us? Still hope in God; he is the
   health of my countenance." We may be sensible of great oppression from
   the power of this enemy; this may cause us to go mourning all the day
   long, and in some sense it ought so to do. Howbeit we ought not hence
   to despond, or to be cast down from our duty or our comfort. Still we
   may trust in God through Christ, and live in continual expectation of
   such spiritual reliefs as shall assuredly preserve us from the dominion
   of sin. This faith, hope, and expectation, we are called unto by the
   gospel; and when they are not cherished, when they are not kept up unto
   a due exercise, all things will go backward in our spiritual condition.

   4. Make especial application unto the Lord Christ, unto whom the
   administration of all spiritual supplies is committed, for the
   communication of them unto you, according unto all especial occasions.
   Hath sin got the advantage of a powerful temptation, so as that it
   seems to put hard for dominion in the soul; as it was with Paul under
   the buffetings of Satan, when he had that answer from the Lord, upon
   his reiterated prayer, "My grace is sufficient for thee;" -- "Sin shall
   not have dominion over thee"? Hath it, by its deceitfulness, brought
   the soul into a lifeless, senseless frame, made it forgetful of duties,
   negligent in them, or without spiritual delight in their performance?
   Hath it almost habituated the soul unto careless and corrupt
   inclinations, unto the love of, or conformity to, the world? Doth it
   take advantage from our darkness and confusion, under troubles,
   distresses, or temptations? On these and the like occasions it is
   required that we make especial fervent application unto the Lord Christ
   for such supplies of grace as may be sufficient and efficacious to
   control the power of sin in them all. This, under the consideration of
   his office and authority unto this end, his grace and readiness from
   special inducements, we are directed unto, Heb. iv. 14-16.

   5. Remember always the way and method of the operation of divine grace
   and spiritual aids. It is true, in our first conversion to God, we are
   as it were surprised by a mighty act of sovereign grace, changing our
   hearts, renewing our minds, and quickening us with a principle of
   spiritual life. Ordinarily, many things are required of us in a way of
   duty in order thereunto; and many previous operations of grace in our
   minds, in illumination and the sense of sin, do materially and
   passively dispose us thereunto, as wood when it is dried is disposed to
   firing: but the work itself is performed by an immediate act of divine
   power, without any active co-operation on our part. But this is not the
   law or rule of the communication or operation of actual grace for the
   subduing of sin. It is given in a way of concurrence with us in the
   discharge of our duties; and when we are sedulous in them, we may be
   sure we shall not fail of divine assistance, according to the
   established rule of the administration of gospel grace. If, therefore
   we complain that we find not the aids mentioned, and if at the same
   time we are not diligent in attendance unto all the duties whereby sin
   may be mortified in us, we are exceedingly injurious to the grace of
   God.

   Wherefore, notwithstanding this objection, the truth stands firm, that
   "sin shall not have dominion over us, for we are not under the law, but
   under grace;" because of the spiritual aids that are administered by
   grace for its mortification and destruction.

   Secondly, The law gives no liberty of any kind; it gendereth unto
   bondage, and so cannot free us from any dominion, -- not that of sin,
   for this must be by liberty. But this we have also by the gospel. There
   is a twofold liberty:-- 1. Of state and condition; 2. Of internal
   operation; and we have both by the gospel.

   The first consists in our deliverance from the law and its curse, with
   all things which claim a right against us by virtue thereof; that is,
   Satan, death, and hell. Out of this state, from whence we can never be
   delivered by the law, we are translated by grace into a state of
   glorious liberty; for by it the Son makes us free. And we receive the
   Spirit of Christ; now, "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
   liberty," 2 Cor. iii. 17. This liberty Christ proclaims in the gospel
   unto all that do believe, Isa. lxi. 1. Hereon they who hear and receive
   the joyful sound are discharged from all debts, bonds, accounts,
   rights, and titles, and are brought into a state of perfect freedom. In
   this state sin can lay no claim to dominion over any one soul. They are
   gone over into the kingdom of Christ, and out from the power of sin,
   Satan, and darkness. Herein, indeed, lies the foundation of our assured
   freedom from the rule of sin. It cannot make an incursion on the
   kingdom of Christ, so as to carry away any of its subjects into a state
   of sin and darkness again. And an interest in this state ought to be
   pleaded against all the attempts of sin, Rom. vi. 1, 2. There is
   nothing more to be detested than that any one who is Christ's freeman,
   and dead to the power of sin, should give place again unto any of its
   pretences to or endeavours for rule.

   Again, there is an internal liberty, which is the freedom of the mind
   from the powerful inward chains of sin, with an ability to act all the
   powers and faculties of the soul in a gracious manner. Hereby is the
   power of sin in the soul destroyed. And this also is given us in the
   gospel. There is power administered in it to live unto God, and to walk
   in all his commandments; and this also gives evidence unto the truth of
   the apostle's assertion.

   Thirdly, The law doth not supply us with effectual motives and
   encouragements to endeavour the ruin of the dominion of sin in a way of
   duty; which must be done, or in the end it will prevail. It works only
   by fear and dread, with threatenings and terrors of destruction; for
   although it says also, "Do this, and live," yet withal it discovers
   such an impossibility in our nature to comply with its commands, in the
   way and manner wherein it enjoins them, that the very promise of it
   becomes a matter of terror, as including the contrary sentence of death
   upon our failure in its commands. Now, these things enervate, weaken,
   and discourage, the soul in its conflict against sin: they give it no
   life, activity, cheerfulness, or courage, in what they undertake. Hence
   those who engage themselves into an opposition unto sin, or a
   relinquishment of its service, merely on the motives of the law, do
   quickly faint and give over. We see it so with many every day. One day
   they will forsake all sin, their beloved sin, with the company and
   occasions inducing them thereunto. The law hath frightened them with
   divine vengeance. And sometimes they proceed so far in this resolution
   that they seem escaped from the pollutions of the world; yet soon again
   they return to their former ways and follies, 2 Pet. ii. 20-22. Their
   "goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away."
   Or if they do not return to wallow in the same mire of their former
   pollutions, they betake themselves to the shades of some superstitious
   observances, as it is in the Papacy: for they openly succeed into the
   room of the Jews, who, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and
   not submitting thereunto, went about variously to establish their own
   righteousness, as the apostle speaks, Rom. x. 3, 4; for in that
   apostate church, where men are wrought on by the terrors of the law to
   relinquish sin and set themselves in opposition unto its power, finding
   themselves altogether unable to do it by the works of the law itself,
   which must be perfectly holy, they betake themselves to a number of
   superstitious observances, which they trust unto in the room of the
   law, with its commands and duties. But the law makes nothing perfect,
   nor are the motives it gives for the ruin of the interest of sin in us
   able to bear us out and carry us through that undertaking.

   But the motives and encouragements given by grace to endeavour the
   utter ruin of sin in a way of duty are such as give life, cheerfulness,
   courage, and perseverance; they continually animate, relieve, and
   revive the soul, in all its work and duty, keeping it from fainting and
   despondency: for they are all taken from the love of God and of Christ,
   from the whole work and end of his mediation, from the ready
   assistances of the Holy Ghost, from all the promises of the gospel,
   from their own with other believers' experiences; all giving them the
   highest assurance of final success and victory. When the soul is under
   the influence of these motives, whatever difficulty and opposition it
   meets withal from soliciting temptations or surprisals "it will renew
   its strength, it will run and not be weary, it will walk and not
   faint," according to the promise, Isa. xl. 31.

   Fourthly, Christ is not in the law; he is not proposed in it, not
   communicated by it, -- we are not made partakers of him thereby. This
   is the work of grace, of the gospel. In it is Christ revealed; by it he
   is proposed and exhibited unto us; thereby are we made partakers of him
   and all the benefits of his mediation. And he it is alone who came to,
   and can, destroy this work of the devil. The dominion of sin is the
   complement of the works of the devil, where all his designs centre.
   This "the Son of God was manifested to destroy." He alone ruins the
   kingdom of Satan, whose power is acted in the rule of sin. Wherefore,
   hereunto our assurance of this comfortable truth is principally
   resolved. And what Christ hath done, and doth, for this end, is a great
   part of the subject of gospel revelation.

   The like may be spoken of the communication of the Holy Spirit, which
   is the only principal efficient cause of the ruin of the dominion of
   sin; for "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty," and
   nowhere else. But we receive this Spirit not "by the works of the law,"
   but "by the hearing of faith," Gal. iii. 2.

Chapter VI.

   The practical observations drawn from, and application made of, the
   whole text.

   Having opened the words, and made some improvement of them, I shall now
   take one or two observations from the design of them, and issue the
   whole in a word of application.

   Obs. 1. It is an unspeakable mercy and privilege to be delivered from
   the dominion of sin. As such it is here proposed by the apostle; as
   such it is esteemed by them that believe. Nothing is more sweet,
   precious, and valuable, unto a soul conflicting with sin and
   temptation, than to hear that sin shall not have the dominion over it.
   Ah! what would some give that it might be spoken unto them with power,
   so as that they might steadfastly believe it and have the comfort of
   it? "Fools make a mock of sin," and some glory in the service of it,
   which is their shame; but those who understand any thing aright, either
   of what is present or what is to come, do know that this freedom from
   its dominion is an invaluable mercy; and we may consider the grounds
   which evidence it so to be.

   First, It appears so to be from the causes of it. It is that which no
   man can by his own power and the utmost of his endeavours attain unto.
   Men by them may grow rich, or wise, or learned; but no man by them can
   shake off the yoke of sin. If a man had all the wealth of the world, he
   could not by it purchase this liberty; it would be despised. And when
   sinners go hence to the place where the rich man was tormented, and
   have nothing more to do with this world, they would give it all, if
   they had it, for an interest in this liberty.

   It is that which the law and all the duties of it cannot procure. The
   law and its duties, as we have declared, can never destroy the dominion
   of sin. All men will find the truth hereof that ever come to fall under
   the power of real conviction. When sin presseth on them, and they are
   afraid of its consequents, they will find that the law is weak, and the
   flesh is weak, and their duties are weak, and their resolutions and
   vows are weak; -- all insufficient to relieve them. And if they think
   themselves freed one day, they shall find the next that they are under
   bondage. Sin, for all this, will rule over them with force and rigour.
   And in this condition do some spend all their days in this world. They
   kindle sparks of their own, and walk in the light of them, until they
   lie down in darkness and sorrow. They sin and promise amendment, and
   endeavour recompenses by some duties, yet can never extricate
   themselves from the yoke of sin. We may therefore learn the excellency
   of this privilege, first, from its causes, whereof I shall mention some
   only:--

   1. The meritorious procuring cause of this liberty is the death and
   blood of Jesus Christ. So it is declared, 1 Pet. i. 18, 19; 1 Cor. vi.
   20, ; vii. 23. Nothing else could purchase this freedom. Under the
   power and dominion of sin we were, and could not be delivered without a
   ransom. "Christ died, and rose, and revived," that he might be our
   Lord, Rom. xiv. 9, and so deliver us from the power of all other lords
   whatever. It is true, there was no ransom due to sin or Satan who was
   the author of it. They were to be dethroned or destroyed by an act of
   power. Both the devil and sin, which is his work, are to be
   "destroyed," not appeased, Heb. ii. 14, 1 John iii. 8. But "the
   strength of sin is the law," 1 Cor. xv. 56; that is, through the
   righteous sentence of God, we were held by the law obnoxious unto the
   condemning power of sin. From that law we could not be delivered but by
   this price and ransom. Two things hence follow:--

   (1.) Those who live in sin, who willingly abide in the service of it,
   and endure its dominion, do cast the utmost contempt on the wisdom,
   love, and grace of Christ. They despise that which cost him so dear;
   they judge that he made a very foolish purchase of this liberty for us
   with his dearest blood. Whatever it be, they prefer the present
   satisfaction of their lusts before it. This is the poison of unbelief.
   There is in it a high contempt of the wisdom and love of Christ. The
   language of men's hearts that live in sin is, that the liberty which he
   purchased with his blood is not to be valued or esteemed. They flatter
   him with their lips in the outward performance of some duties; but in
   their hearts they despise him and the whole work of his mediation. But
   the time is approaching wherein they will learn the difference between
   the slavery of sin and the liberty wherewith Christ makes believers
   free. And this is that which is now tendered unto sinners in the
   dispensation of the gospel. Life and death are here set before you;
   choose life, that ye may live forever.

   (2.) Let those that are believers, in all their conflicts with sin,
   live in the exercise of faith on this purchase of liberty made by the
   blood of Christ; for two things will hence ensue:-- [1.] That they will
   have a weighty argument always in readiness to oppose unto the deceit
   and violence of sin. The soul will hereon say to itself, "Shall I
   forego and part with that which Christ purchased for me at so dear a
   rate, by giving place to the solicitations of lust or sin? shall I
   despise his purchase? God forbid!" See Rom. vi. 2. By such arguings is
   the mind frequently preserved from closing with the enticements and
   seductions of sin. [2.] It is an effectual argument for faith to use in
   its pleading for deliverance from the power of sin. We ask for nothing
   but what Christ hath purchased for us; and if this plea be pursued, it
   will be prevalent.

   2. The internal efficient cause of this liberty, or that whereby the
   power and rule of sin is destroyed in us, is the Holy Spirit himself;
   which farther evinceth the greatness of this mercy. Every act for the
   mortification of sin is no less immediately from him than those
   positive graces are whereby we are sanctified. It is "through the
   Spirit" that we "mortify the deeds of the body," Rom. viii. 13. Where
   he is, there, and there alone, is liberty. All attempts for the
   mortification of sin without his especial aids and operations are
   frustrate. And this manifests the extent of the dominion of sin in the
   world. He alone by whom it can be destroyed, and all these efficacious
   operations of his whereby it is so, are generally despised; and they
   must live and die slaves unto sin by whom they are so. Wherefore, a
   great part of our wisdom for the attaining and preserving this liberty
   consists in the acting of faith on that promise of our Saviour, that
   our heavenly Father will "give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him" of
   him. When sin in any instance, by any temptation, urgeth for power and
   rule in us, we are ready to turn into ourselves and our own
   resolutions, which in their place are not to be neglected; but
   immediate cries unto God for such supplies of his Spirit as without
   which sin will not be subdued, we shall find our best relief. Bear it
   in mind, try it on the next occasion, and God will bless it with
   success.

   3. The instrumental cause of this freedom is the duty of believers
   themselves in and for the destruction of sin. And this also manifests
   the importance of this privilege. This is one of the principal ends of
   all our religious duties, -- of prayer, of fasting, of meditation, of
   watchfulness unto all other duties of obedience; they are all designed
   to prevent and ruin the interest of sin in us. We are called into a
   theatre, to fight and contend; into a field, to be tried in a warfare.
   Our enemy is this sin, which strives and contends for the rule over us.
   This we are to resist even unto blood; that is, unto our utmost in
   doing and suffering. And certainly that is in itself and unto us of the
   highest importance, which, on divine appointment and command, is the
   great end of the constant endeavours of our whole lives.

   Secondly, It appears so to be from the consideration of the bondage
   which we are delivered from thereby. Bondage is that which human nature
   is most averse from, until it be debased and debauched by sensual
   lusts. Men of ingenuous spirits have in all ages chosen rather to die
   than to be made slaves. But there is no such bondage as that which is
   under the dominion of sin. To be under the power of base lusts, as
   covetousness, uncleanness, drunkenness, ambition, pride, and the like,
   to make provision to fulfil their desires in the wills of the mind and
   the flesh, is the worst of slavery.

   But we may say what we please on this subject; none think themselves so
   free, none make such an appearance of generous freedom unto others, as
   those who are avowed servants of sin. If those are not freemen who do
   what they please, and are for the most part approved in what they do,
   who puff at all their enemies, and scorn such as pusillanimous slaves
   who go not forth unto the same compass of excess with them, who shall
   be esteemed free? They plead, with the Pharisees, that they are the
   only freemen, and were never in bondage to any! The servile restraints
   of fear from divine judgment and future accounts they wholly despise!
   See the description, Ps. lxxiii. 4-11. Who so free, so joyous, as such
   persons! As for others, they are "plagued all the day long, and are
   chastened every morning," verse 14; yea, they go heavily and mournfully
   under the oppression of this enemy, crying out continually for
   deliverance.

   But the truth insisted on is not at all impeached by this observation.
   It is a great part of the slavery of such persons that they know not
   themselves to be slaves, and boast that they are free. They are born in
   a state of enmity against God and bondage under sin; and they like well
   of it, as all abject slaves do under the worst of tyrants: they know no
   better. But true liberty consists in inward peace, tranquillity of
   mind, designs for and inclinations unto the best things, the most noble
   objects of our natural, rational souls. All these they are utter
   strangers unto who spend their lives in the service of vile and base
   lusts. Envy not their gallantry, their glittering appearances, their
   heaps of wealth and treasures; they are, on the whole, vile and
   contemptible slaves. The apostle determines their case, Rom. vi. 17. It
   is a matter of eternal thankfulness unto God that we are delivered from
   being "the servants of sin."

   Yea, it is an evidence of grace, of a good frame of spirit, when a soul
   is made really sensible of the excellency of this freedom, when it
   finds the power and interest of sin to be so weakened as that it can
   rejoice in it, and be thankful to God for it, Rom. vii. 25.

   Thirdly, It is so with respect unto the end of this bondage, or what it
   brings men unto. If, after all the base drudgery which sinful men are
   put unto in the service of their lusts; if, after all the conflicts
   which their consciences put them on, with fears and terrors in the
   world, -- they could expect any thing of a future reward hereafter,
   something might be spoken to alleviate their present misery: but "the
   wages of sin is death;" eternal death, under the wrath of the great
   God, is all they are to look for. The end of the dominion of sin is to
   give them up unto the curse of the law and power of the devil for
   evermore.

   Fourthly, It keeps men off from the participation of all real good,
   here and hereafter. What men under the power of sin do enjoy will
   quickly appear to be "a thing of nought." In the meantime, they have
   not the least taste of the love of God; which alone takes out the
   poison of their enjoyments. They have not the least view of the glory
   of Christ; without which they live in perpetual darkness, like those
   who never behold the light nor sun. They have no experience of the
   sweetness and excellency of the gracious influences of life, and
   strength, and comfort, from the Holy Ghost, nor of that satisfaction
   and reward which is in holy obedience; nor shall ever come to the
   enjoyment of God.

   All these things, and sundry others of the like sort, might be insisted
   on and enlarged, to manifest the greatness of the mercy and privilege
   which is in a freedom from the dominion of sin, as it is here proposed
   by the apostle; but the principal design I intended is accomplished,
   and I do but touch on these things.

   I shall add one observation more, and with it put a close to this
   discourse:--

   Obs. 2. It is the great interest of a soul conflicting with the power
   of sin to secure itself against its dominion, that it is not under its
   dominion, not to have the cause hang dubious in the mind. To clear the
   truth hereof we may observe the things that follow:--

   First, The conflict with sin, making continual repentance and
   mortification absolutely necessary, will continue in us whilst we are
   in this world. Pretences of perfection here are contrary to the
   Scriptures, contrary to the universal experience of all believers, and
   contrary to the sense and conscience of them by whom they are pleaded,
   as they make it evident every day. We pray against it, strive against
   it, groan for deliverance from it; and that, by the grace of Christ
   healing our nature, not without success. Howbeit this success extends
   not unto its absolute abolition whilst we are in this world. It will
   abide in us until the union of the soul and body, wherein it hath
   incorporated itself, be dissolved. This is our lot and portion; this is
   the consequent of our apostasy from God, and of the depravation of our
   nature thereby.

   You will say, then, "Whereto serves the gospel and the grace of our
   Lord Jesus Christ in this case, if it be not able to give us
   deliverance herein?" I answer, It doth give us a fourfold relief, which
   amounts virtually to a constant deliverance, though sin will abide in
   us whilst we are in this world:--

   1. It is so ordered that the continuance of sin in us shall be the
   ground, reason, and occasion, of the exercise of all grace, and of
   putting a lustre on our obedience. Some excellent graces, as repentance
   and mortification, could have no exercise if it were otherwise; and
   whilst we are in this world, there is a beauty in them that is an
   overbalance for the evil of the remainders of sin. And the difficulty
   which is hereby put on our obedience, calling continually for the
   exercise and improvement of all grace, renders it the more valuable.
   Herein lies the spring of humility and self-resignation to the will of
   God. This makes us love and long for the enjoyment of Christ, putting
   an excellency on his mediation; whence the apostle, on the
   consideration of it, falls into that ejaculation, "I thank God through
   Jesus Christ our Lord!" Rom. vii. 25. This sweetens unto us our future
   rest and reward. Wherefore, the continuance of us in this state and
   condition in this world, -- a state of spiritual warfare, -- is best
   for us, and highly suited unto divine wisdom, considering the office
   and care of our Lord Jesus Christ for our relief. Let us not complain,
   or repine, or faint, but go on with Christian fortitude unto the end,
   and we shall have success; for, --

   2. There are, by the grace of Christ, such supplies and aids of
   spiritual strength granted unto believers, that sin shall never proceed
   farther in them than is useful and needful for the exercise of their
   graces. It shall never have its will upon them nor dominion over them,
   as we have before declared.

   3. There is mercy administered in and by the gospel for the pardon of
   all that is evil in itself or in any of its effects: "There is no
   condemnation unto them that are in Christ Jesus." Pardoning mercy,
   according to the tenor of the covenant, doth always disarm this sin in
   believers of its condemning power; so that, notwithstanding the utmost
   endeavours of it, "being justified by faith, they have peace with God."

   4. There is a season when, by the grace of Christ, it shall be utterly
   abolished, -- namely, at death, when the course of our obedience is
   finished.

   Wherefore, to affirm that this sin, and consequently a conflict with
   it, doth abide in believers whilst they are in this world, is no
   disparagement unto the grace of Christ, which gives such a blessed
   deliverance from it.

   Secondly, There is a double conflict with and against sin. The one is
   in those that are unregenerate, consisting in the rebellion of light
   and conscience against the rule of sin in many particular instances;
   for although sin be enthroned in the will and affections, yet the
   knowledge of good and evil in the mind, excited by the hopes and fears
   of things eternal, will make head against it, as unto the performance
   of sundry duties and abstinence from sin. This conflict may be where
   sin is in the throne, and may deceive themselves, supposing it to be
   from the rule of grace, when it is only from the rebellion of light and
   the charge of a conscience yet unseared. But there is a conflict with
   sin where grace hath the rule and is enthroned; for although grace have
   the sovereignty in the mind and heart, yet the remainders of sin,
   especially in the corrupt affections, will be continually rebelling
   against it. Now this, we say, is the interest of all, namely, to
   inquire of what sort and kind that conflict with sin is which is in
   them. If it be of the first sort, they may yet be under the dominion of
   sin; if of the latter, they are freed from it. Wherefore, whilst the
   mind is dubious in this case and undetermined, many evil consequences
   it will be perplexed withal. I shall name some of them:--

   1. Such a soul can have no solid peace, because it hath not
   satisfaction what state it doth belong unto. 2. It cannot receive
   refreshment by gospel consolations in any condition, for its just fears
   of the dominion of sin will defeat them all. 3. It will be dead and
   formal in all its duties, without spiritual courage and delight, which
   will at length make it weary of them. So, 4. All grace, especially
   faith, will be weakened and impaired under this frame continually. 5.
   Fear of death will hold the soul in bondage. Wherefore, it is highly
   necessary to have this case well stated and determined in our minds;
   whereto if the foregoing discourses may contribute any thing, it is
   what was designed in them.

   There remains only to give some few directions how the prevalency of
   sin, unto such a degree as to render the case about its rule dubious in
   the mind, may be obviated and prevented. Some few of the many that
   might be given I shall propose:--

   1. The great rule for preventing the increase and power of vicious
   habits is, watch against beginnings. Sin doth not attempt dominion but
   in particular instances, by one especial lust or another. Wherefore, if
   any sin or corrupt lust begin, as it were, to set up for a peculiar
   predominancy or interest in the mind and affections, if it be not
   entertained with severe mortification, it will ruin the peace, if not
   endanger the safety, of the soul. And when this is so, it may easily be
   discovered by any one who keepeth a diligent watch over his heart and
   ways; for no sin doth so entirely advance itself in the mind and
   affections, but it is promoted therein either by men's natural
   inclinations, or by their circumstances on occasions of life, or by
   some temptation which they have exposed themselves unto, or by some
   such neglect wherein the frequency of acts has strengthened vicious
   inclinations. But these things may be easily discerned by those who are
   in any measure awake unto their soul's concernments.

   The strict charge given us by our Lord Jesus Christ to "watch," and
   that of the wise man, "above all keepings to keep our heart," have
   especial regard unto these beginnings of sin's obtaining power in us.
   So soon as a discovery is made of its coincidence or conjunction with
   any of these ways of the promotion of its power, if it be not opposed
   with severe and diligent mortification, it will proceed in the method
   declared, James i. 14, 15.

   Those who would be wise must familiarize wisdom unto their minds by a
   continual free converse with it. They must say unto wisdom, "Thou art
   my sister," and call understanding their kinswoman, Prov. vii. 4. So
   will wisdom have power in and over their minds And if we suffer sin, by
   any of the advantages mentioned, to familiarize itself unto our minds,
   -- if we say not unto it, "Get thee hence," upon the first appearance
   of its activity for power in us, -- it will put hard for the throne.

   2. Carefully inquire and try whether such things which you may do or
   approve of in yourselves do not promote the power of sin, and help on
   its rule in you. This method David prescribes, Ps. xix. 12, 13. "Secret
   sins," such as are not known to be sins, it may be, to ourselves, make
   way for those that are "presumptuous." Thus pride may seem to be
   nothing but a frame of mind belonging unto our wealth and dignity, or
   our parts and abilities; sensuality may seem to be but a lawful
   participation of the good things of this life; passion and peevishness,
   but a due sense of the want of that respect which we suppose due unto
   us; covetousness, a necessary care of ourselves and our families. If
   the seeds of sin are covered with such pretences, they will in time
   spring up and bear bitter fruit in the minds and lives of men. And the
   beginnings of all apostasy, both in religion and morality, lie in such
   pretences. Men plead they can do so and so lawfully, until they can do
   things openly unlawful.

   3. Keep your hearts always tender under the word. This is the true and
   only state of inconsistency with and repugnancy to the rule of sin. The
   loss hereof, or a decay herein, is that which hath opened the
   flood-gates of sin amongst us. Where this frame is a conscientious fear
   of sinning will always prevail in the soul; where it is lost, men will
   be bold in all sorts of follies And that this frame may be preserved,
   it is required, -- (1.) That we cast out all vicious habits of mind
   that are contrary unto it, James i. 21; (2.) That we preserve an
   experience of its power and efficacy on our souls, 1 Pet. ii. 1-3; (3.)
   That we lay aside all prejudices against those that dispense it, Gal.
   iv. 16; (4.) That we keep the heart always humble, in which frame alone
   it is teachable, Ps. xxv. 9, -- every thing in the preaching of the
   word comes cross and unpleasing to the minds of proud men; (5.) That we
   pray for a blessing on the ministry, which is the best preparation for
   receiving benefit by it.

   4. Abhor that peace of mind which is consistent with any known sin. Men
   may have frequent surprisals into known sins, but if, whilst it is so
   with them, they refuse all inward peace but what comes in by most
   fervent and sincere desires of deliverance from them and repentance for
   them, they may be safe from the dominion of sin; but if men can on any
   hopes, or presumptions, or resolutions, preserve a kind of peace in
   their minds whilst they live in any known sin, they are nigh the
   borders of that security which is the territory wherein sin doth reign.

   5. Make continual applications unto the Lord Christ, in all the acts of
   his mediation, for the ruin of sin, especially when it attempts a
   dominion in you, Heb. iv. 16. This is the life and soul of all
   directions in this case, which needs not here to be enlarged on; it is
   frequently spoken unto.

   Lastly, Remember that a due sense of deliverance from the dominion of
   sin is the most effectual motive unto universal obedience and holiness;
   as such it is proposed and managed by the apostle, Rom. vi.
