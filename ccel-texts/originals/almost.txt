PREFATORY NOTE.

   IT can scarce be needed, for most of the readers into whose hands this
   volume may come, to commend a writer so well known as the Nonconformist
   worthy, Matthew Mead, or to bespeak respectful and devout perusal for a
   book, so long and widely circulated, and so greatly useful, as has been
   his treatise, "The Almost Christian."

   He was of the times of Owen, Bunyan, and Baxter. How high a place the
   man and his writings occupied, in the esteem of the eminent author of
   the "Call to the Unconverted," and of the "Saint's Rest," a single
   reference may sufficiently prove. In the great work of Richard Baxter,
   on the morals and casuistry of the gospel, his "Christian Directory,"
   he furnishes lists of volumes suitable to form the library of a
   Christian. Classifying his catalogues according to the probable extent
   of the means, that various classes of his readers would possess for the
   purchase of books, he begins with those purchasers of most limited
   resources. "I will name you, first," (says Baxter) "the poorest or
   smallest library that is tolerable." Enumerating as its basis, a Bible,
   Concordance, and Catechisms, he proceeds to name some scores of writers
   on practical religion. In some cases he commends but a single treatise
   of an author, and in others, his entire writings this latter and higher
   honor, he accords to his contemporary and fellow-confessor, Matthew
   Mead. Among the "affectionate practical English writers," as he
   describes them, and of which he advises the poor man to secure "as many
   of them as you can get," [1] he places "Mr. Mead's works." To those
   remembering the practised sagacity, the long and varied experience, the
   discursive reading, and the profound piety of the Kidderminster pastor,
   nothing need be said as to the value of his commendation, in favor of
   the character, or the compositions, to which it may be given.

   But Mead had other and not less eminent friends, among the great and
   good men of the Commonwealth and Protectorate. By the appointment of
   Oliver Cromwell himself, he held the New Chapel at Shadwell, in
   Middlesex. On the fatal St. Bartholomew's day, he was ejected thence,
   among those illustrious nonconformist confessors, whose praises even
   the poet Wordsworth, attached as he is to the English Established
   Church, could not forbear to sing. In one of his ministerial charges,
   he had been associated with Greenhill, the author of a commentary on
   Ezekiel, of high repute. After some liberty granted to the Dissenters,
   he was a preacher at Stepney, where a large congregation gathered
   around him; and where, in 1674, a spacious house of worship was erected
   for their use. Accused, with the excellent Dr. Owen and others, of some
   participation in that Rye House Plot, for which Lord William Russel
   suffered death, Mead retired for a time to Holland, though conscious of
   entire innocence; but returned to Britain, and continued his labors
   until his death, October 16, 1699, at the age of seventy. His funeral
   sermon was delivered by the great John Howe, with whom his friendship
   stretched over more than half a life-time, having, as Howe declared,
   continued through some forty-three years. When asked, in his last
   sickness, how he was, his reply had the quaint, but earnest simplicity
   of one to whom the New Jerusalem had long been the theme of familiar
   and habitual aspirations: "Going home, as every honest man ought, when
   his work is done." One of his sons was Dr. Richard Mead, the
   contemporary of Addison and Pope, eminent in the medical annals of
   England, and author, amongst other works, of a book on the diseases
   named in Scripture, "De Morbis Biblicis;" a topic, to the selection of
   which the memory of his excellent parent, and of the pursuits of that
   father, may have first directed him. One of the sermons, in the
   collection often reprinted of Farewell Discourses by the Ejected
   Ministers of 1662, is by Matthew Mead. [2]

   The age to which our author belonged, was one in which, for a time,
   religion made wide and. rapid progress. That in the days of its secular
   prosperity, many might be won but to a formal and even hypocritical
   assumption of its rites and profession, was to be expected. But neither
   in Scotland nor in England, nor in our own New England, was there any
   lack of fidelity in applying to the churches tests of fearless
   thoroughness. The work of Guthrie, "The Trial of a Saving Interest in
   Christ," produced north of the Tweed; Mead's "Almost Christian," issued
   to the south of that boundary and the book by Shephard, of Cambridge,
   in Massachusetts, "The Parable of the Ten Virgins," are volumes of
   kindred character and show that the eminent pastors of those times,
   were direct, and stern, and searching in the tests to which they would
   submit the hopes of the disciple of Christ.

   The art of the husbandman, his field, his seed, his plough, and his
   flail, furnish, it is evident to the most heedless reader of the New
   Testament, a favorite class of illustrations to our Lord and Saviour,
   in explaining and enforcing the effects of true religion on the heart
   and conduct of men. May we not, from that same art, borrow a simple and
   kindred illustration of the object which such writers as Guthrie,
   Shephard, and Mead have sought, and of the uses which such works as the
   present volume may well subserve, in the hands of every serious reader?
   It is known, that in the agriculture of our own times, very much of
   advance is expected beyond the success of our fathers, in the greater
   depth to which the modern ploughman is expected to drive his
   ploughshare. Instead of stirring, merely, the upper surface of the
   earth, the instruments of the tiller are now contrived to force their
   way below the roots of grasses and weeds; and the laborer is required
   to rely on faithful SUB-SOIL ploughing. In proportion as the possession
   of a religious hope becomes common, facile, and lucrative, in that same
   degree does self-delusion become more easy; and, in that same
   proportion, should this thorough scrutiny of our own motives and way,
   this sub-soil ploughing of the heart, be regarded as the more
   necessary. It has in its favor an authority from which there can be no
   appeal, when our Lord himself, the judge by whose scrutiny our hopes
   are to be finally tested, has, in allusion to the need of a religious
   trust, rightly planted and deeply based, commended the wan who "DIGGED
   DEEP." (Luke vi. 48.)

EXTRACTS
FROM PREFACE TO GLASGOW REPRINT.

    BY THE REV. D. YOUNG, OF PERTH.

   [THE late distinguished Dr. Chalmers commenced, with the aid of some
   other ministers of his own country and England, a series of re-issues
   of works of great usefulness, under the title of "Select Christian
   Authors, with Introductory Essays, Chalmers and Collins, Glasgow."
   Chalmers himself furnished several introductions; and it was in this
   series, that John Foster issued his long and excellent introduction, to
   "Doddridge's Rise and Progress of Religion;" and Edward Irving gave a
   valuable Essay, at the head of a reprint of "Bishop Horne on the
   Psalms." Mead's "Almost Christian," was one of the treatises thus
   prefaced and reprinted. The Introductory Essay, was by an excellent
   minister of Perth, the Rev. David Young. From it we have drawn the
   following remarks.]

   "The almost Christian'--if there be one thing more than another, which
   its pages are fitted to produce, it is a godly jealousy. To awaken
   this, and realize the fruits of it, is the author's chosen purpose. It
   is truly a searching volume. Its author saw the havoc which an easy
   credulity in matters of religion was spreading among professors of his
   own time; his spirit was stirred within him, at the thought of the
   delusion which it propagated, and the immensity of the interests which
   it bartered away; and in discharging a duty to the men of his
   generation, he has put on record a word in season to us. The volume is
   now intercepted from the disuse into which it was sinking; a laudable
   effort is made, to present it afresh to the religious public; and most
   devoutly is it to be wished, that the exercises which it inculcates,
   and to which it so honestly leads the way, may become the
   characteristic of modern professors. The immediate effect of such a
   revulsion might be, an extensive overthrow of hopes and purposes; but
   its latter end would be, righteousness and peace. It might lead to that
   fearfulness which surpriseth the hypocrite; but nothing whatever would
   it demolish, except those refuges of lies which the hail of a judgment
   to come must ultimately sweep away.

   "We cannot, indeed, withhold the remark, although it should be deemed
   censorious, that there is a very peculiar adaptation of the sentiments
   of this little book to the character of the times in which we are
   living. We all know the extent to which we set the fashion to each
   other in religion as in everything else, and every wise man will take
   care so to estimate the spirit of his times, as to ascertain the
   precise kind of modification into which they tend to form his
   character. There are times when Christianity is newly introduced among
   a people, or when an important reformation in its general profession
   has been recently effected, or when professors are assailed by
   persecution, or when a general revival of religion in its life and
   power has taken place, and in these times there is a tendency to the
   production of a severe sanctity in morals, and a peculiarly fervent and
   decided piety. In this state of things, the man of neutrality cannot
   subsist, and must either make an effort to come up to the general
   standard, or see himself left in the congregation of sinners. Such,
   however, are not our times. We have grown old in the enjoyment of
   peace, and the use of external privilege; the public creeds of most of
   our churches are substantially orthodox: this has produced, and is
   still maintaining a general soundness of religious sentiment among the
   professing community at large. The continued enforcement of Christian
   doctrine on the minds of the people, is preserving, if not extending a
   commendable decency of deportment; the attention paid to religious
   training among the young, with the remaining purity of Christian
   fellowship so far as it prevails, and the mingling influence of pious
   example from those who are decidedly Christian, have refined away the
   coarseness of the age, and induced even scepticism herself to speak
   with courtesy of the religion of the land. Now, let these things be put
   together and seriously thought of--let their tendency to induce a man
   to think well of himself, since he confessedly holds so much, and
   stands so well with others around him, be fairly estimated, and surely
   it will be granted that there is reason at least to inquire whether
   amidst the ease and tranquillity of our times, we are not egregiously
   forgetting ourselves, and singing a dismal lullaby over the slumberings
   of piety. When a man gives himself to considerations like these in the
   deep seclusion of serious thought--when he connects them for
   illustration with what he sees and hears, and allows them to speak
   their native language to his understanding and his heart, he cannot
   suppress the working suspicion--that we are setting a fashion to each
   other of a kind the most injurious, and that the very generation to
   which we belong, more fearfully perhaps than any other, is abounding
   with Almost Christians.'

   "For such a state of things, the reader has in his hands an admirable
   antidote, applied with a plainness, and point, and delightful felicity
   of scriptural illustration, which render it both impressive and
   memorable. Matthew Mead, it is very true, was a man of olden habits,
   and to the charms of modern diction, his book has no pretensions; but
   we see him in the garb of his times, and that taste must be pettish
   indeed, which would wish to see him in any other. The style of the
   book, although unadorned, is yet perspicuous and striking, and the very
   homeliness of its phrases, in instances not a few, is happily fitted to
   promote its efficiency.

   "It is a book of topics, containing much meaning in few words; and the
   serious reader may often regret that more has not been said, on matters
   which he feels to be so very interesting. But this appearance of defect
   is in reality an excellence; its aim is to provoke a scrutiny of
   character; and the writer who proposes this, has done enough, when he
   has shown cause for such a scrutiny, digested maxims for conducting it,
   and impressed his reader with the importance of the subject. The thing
   wanted here, is not an agent to do the work for a man, but a guide and
   monitor to furnish him with facilities, and ply him with motives to do
   it for himself.

   "It is a book of dissections, in which every department of the
   Christian character is skilfully divested of its covering, and laid
   open to impartial survey; and although it would be too much to say,
   that in the performance of a task, which exhibits such diversity, and
   requires such a nicety of spiritual discrimination, nothing has been
   done to disturb the peace of a saint; yet the instances in which its
   author is chargeable with this, we take to be very few; while perhaps
   there is not one of them in which the pain produced, if rightly
   improven, is not salutary in its tendency, or fails to lead on to more
   exalted enjoyment. But supposing that instances do occur, in which the
   peace of conscience is unduly disturbed, or that a sentiment, here and
   there, has dropped from the pen of the author, which tends to a false
   or injurious alarm, still it is better that a reparable injury should
   be suffered, than that a delusion which is irreparable should remain
   undetected. It is the lot of the messenger, who either lifts up his
   voice or his pen to publish the counsel of God to man in the present
   complex state of society, that he cannot sound an alarm to the wicked,
   without putting some of the righteous in fear; nor can he minister
   consolation to the latter, without at least the hazard of having his
   message misapplied by the perversity of the latter. For these things,
   however, he is not accountable, although it is well that they overawe
   him. The scene in which he labors, is adjusted to his hand, by a wisdom
   which cannot err, and which has left him no choice, but to take things
   as he finds them; guarding himself as he can against either extreme,
   and imploring as he goes on, that, by, the mercy of the Lord, he may be
   found faithful.

   "But leaving the treatise to speak for itself, we beseech the man who
   is but almost a Christian, in travelling through its pages to avail
   himself of its aid. We ask him simply, to reason the matter on the
   principles and findings which it sets before him; but to do this in
   that spirit of earnest and humble inquisitiveness, which befits so
   grave a subject: and if such a spirit be far from him, or appearing to
   evaporate as he proceeds, let him pause and invoke its return, from
   that God in Jesus Christ, who maketh the heart of the rash to
   understand doctrine. As be wishes to prosper, let him never forget,
   that while it is easy to show him the proper means, and possible to
   bring him into contact with these, yet the disposition to apply the
   means in such a way, as to gain their end, cometh forth from Him, who
   is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working."

    TO THE

CONGREGATION AT ST. SEPULCHRE'S,

    THAT WERE THE

  AUDITORS OF THESE SERMONS,

    GRACE AND PEACE BE MULTIPLIED.

   Beloved,

   WHAT the meaning of that providence was, that called me to the
   occupation of my talent amongst you this summer, will be best read and
   understood by the effects of it upon your own souls. The kindly
   increase of grace and holiness in heart and life, can only prove it to
   have been in mercy. Where this is not the fruit of the word, there it
   becomes a judgment. The word travels with life or death, salvation or
   damnation, and bringeth forth one or the other in every soul that hears
   it. I would not for a world (were it in my power to make the choice)
   that my labors, which were meant and designed for the promotion of your
   immortal souls to the glory of the other world, in a present pursuance
   of the things of your peace, should be found to have been a
   ministration of death and condemnation, in the great day of Jesus
   Christ. Yet this the Lord knoweth, is the too common effect of the most
   plain and powerful preaching of the gospel. "The waters of the
   sanctuary" do not always heal where they come, for there are "miry and
   marshy places that shall be given to salt." The same word is elsewhere
   in Scripture rendered "barrenness;" He "turneth a fruitful land into
   barrenness;"--so that the judgment denounced upon these miry and marshy
   places is, that the curse of barrenness shall rest upon them,
   notwithstanding the "waters of the sanctuary overflow them."

   It is said, with certainty, that the gospel inflicteth a death of its
   own, as well as the law; or else how are those trees in Jude said to be
   twice dead, and plucked up by the roots." Yea, that which in itself is
   the greatest mercy, through the interposition of men's lusts, and the
   efficacy of this cursed sin of unbelief, turns to the greatest
   judgment, as the richest and most generous wine makes the sharpest
   vinegar. Our Lord Christ himself, the choicest mercy with which the
   bowels of God could bless a perishing world; whose coming, himself
   bearing witness, was on no less an errand than that of eternal life and
   blessedness to the lost and cursed sons of Adam; yet to how many was he
   a "stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence;" yea, "a gin, and a
   snare;" and that to both the houses of Israel, the only professing
   people of God at that day in the world? And is he not a stone of
   stumbling in the ministry of the gospel to many professors to this very
   day, upon which they fall and are broken? When he saith, "Blessed is he
   whosoever shall not be offended in me," he therein plainly supposes,
   that both in his person and doctrine the generality of men would be
   offended in him.

   Not that this is the design of Christ and the gospel, but it comes so
   to pass through the corruptions of the hearts of men, whereby they make
   light of Christ, and stand out against that life and grace which the
   Lord Jesus by his blood so dearly purchased, and is by the preaching of
   the gospel so freely tendered; the wilful refusal whereof will as
   surely double our damnation, as the acceptance thereof will secure our
   eternal salvation.

   O consider, it is a thing of the most serious concern in the world, how
   we carry ourselves under the gospel, and with what dispositions and
   affections of heart soul-seasons of grace are entertained; this being
   taken into the consideration to give it weight, that we are the nearer
   to heaven or hell, to salvation or damnation, by every ordinance we sit
   under. Boast not therefore of privileges enjoyed, with neglect of the
   important duties thereby required. Remember Capernaum's case and
   tremble. As many go to heaven by the very gates of hell, so more go to
   hell by the gates of heaven; in that the number of those that profess
   Christ is greater than the number of those that truly close with
   Christ.

   Beloved, I know the preaching of the gospel hath proselyted many of you
   into a profession; but I fear that but few of you are brought by it to
   a true close with the Lord Christ for salvation. I beseech you bear
   with my jealousy, for it is the fruit of a tender love for your
   precious souls. Most men are good Christians in the verdict of their
   own opinion; but you know the law alloweth no man to be a witness in
   his own case, because their affection usually overreacheth conscience,
   and self-love deceiveth truth for its own interest.

   The heart of man is the greatest impostor and cheat in the world; God
   himself states it--"The heart is deceitful above all things." Some of
   the deceits thereof you will find discovered in this Treatise, which
   shows you, that every grace hath its counterfeit, and that the highest
   profession may be, where true conversion is not.

   The design of it is not to "break the bruised reed, nor to quench the
   smoking flax." Not to discourage the weakest believer, but to awaken
   formal professors. I would not sadden the hearts of any "whom God would
   not have made sad;" though I know it is hard to expose the dangerous
   state and condition of a professing hypocrite, but that the weak
   Christian will think himself concerned in the discovery. And therefore,
   as I preached a sermon on sincerity among you, for the support and
   encouragement of such, so I purposed to have printed it with this. But
   who can be master of his own purposes? That is, as I am under such
   daily variety of providences, your kindly acceptance of this, will make
   me a debtor for that.

   The dedication hereof belongs to you on a double account; for as it had
   not been preached, but that love to your souls caused it, so it had
   much less been printed, but that your importunate desire procured it.
   And therefore what entertainment soever it finds in the world, yet I
   hope I may expect you will welcome it, especially considering it was
   born under your roof, and therefore hopes to find favor in your eyes,
   and room in your hearts.

   Accept it, I beseech you, as a public acknowledgment of the engagements
   which your great, and, I think I may say, unparalleled respects have
   laid me under, which I can no way compensate but by my prayers; and if
   you will take them for satisfaction, I promise to be your remembrancer
   at the throne of grace, whilst I am

   MATTHEW MEAD.
     __________________________________________________________________

TO THE READER.

   READER,

   I KNOW how customary it is for men to ascend the public stage with
   premised apologies for the weakness and unworthiness of their labors,
   which is an argument that their desires (either for the sake of others'
   profit, or their own credit, or both) are stretched beyond the bounds
   of their abilities; and that they covet to commend themselves to the
   world's censure, in a better dress than common infirmity will allow.
   For my own part, I may truly say with Gideon, "Behold, my thousand is
   the meanest," my talent is the smallest, "and I am the least in my
   Father's house;" and therefore this appearance in public is not the
   fruit of my own choice, which would rather have been on some other
   subject, wherein I stand in some sense indebted to the world, or else
   somewhat more digested, and possibly better fitted for common
   acceptation. But this is but to consult the interest of a man's own
   name, which, in matters of this concern, is no better than a "sowing to
   the flesh," and the harvest of such a seed-time will be "in
   corruption."

   Thou hast here one of the saddest considerations imaginable presented
   to thee, and that is, "How far it is possible a man may go in a
   profession of religion, and yet, after all, fall short of salvation;
   how far he may run, and yet not so run as to obtain." This, I say, is
   sad, but not so sad as true; for our Lord Christ doth plainly attest
   it: "Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you,
   will seek to enter in, and shall not be able."

   My design herein is, that the formal, sleepy professor may be awakened,
   and the close hypocrite discovered; but my fear is, that weak believers
   may be hereby discouraged; for, as it is hard to show, how low a child
   of God may fall into sin, and yet have true grace, but that the sinner
   will be apt thereupon to presume; so it is as bard to show how high a
   hypocrite may rise in a profession, and yet have no grace, but that the
   believer will be apt thereupon to despond. The prevention whereof I
   have carefully endeavored, by showing, that though a man may go thus
   far, and yet be but almost a Christian, yet a man may fall short of
   this, and be a true Christian notwithstanding. Judge not, therefore,
   thy state by any one character thou findest laid down of a false
   professor; but read the whole, and then make a judgment; for I have
   cared, as not to "give children's bread to dogs," so not to use the
   dog's whip to scare the children; yet I could wish that this book might
   fall into the hands of such only whom it chiefly concerns, who "have a
   name to live, and yet are dead;" being busy with the "form of
   godliness," but strangers to the "power of it." These are the proper
   subjects of this treatise: and the Lord follow it with his blessing
   wherever it comes, that it may be an awakening word to all such, and
   especially to that generation of profligate professors with which this
   age abounds; who, if they keep to their church, bow the knee, talk over
   a few prayers, and at a good time receive the sacra went, think they do
   enough for heaven, and hereupon judge their condition safe, and their
   salvation sure; though there be a hell of sin in their hearts, "and the
   poison of asps is under their lips;" their minds being as yet carnal
   and unconverted, and their conversations filthy and unsanctified. If
   eternal life be of so easy attainment, and to be had at so cheap a
   rate, why did our Lord Christ tell us, "Strait is the gate and narrow
   is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it?" And
   why should the apostle perplex us with such a needless injunction, "to
   give diligence to make our calling and election sure?" Certainly,
   therefore, it is no such easy thing to be saved, as many make it; and
   that thou wilt see plainly in the following discourse. I have been
   somewhat short in the application of it; and therefore let me here be
   thy remembrancer in five important duties:--

   First, "Take heed of resting in a form of godliness; as if duties, ex
   opere operato, could confer grace. A lifeless formality is advanced to
   a very high esteem in the world, as a "cab of dove's dung" was sold in
   the famine of Samaria at a very dear rate. Alas! the profession of
   godliness is but a sandy foundation to build the hope of an immortal
   soul upon for eternity. Remember, the Lord Jesus Christ called him a
   foolish builder, "that founded his house upon the sand," and the sad
   event proved him so, "for it fell, and great was the fall of it." O
   therefore lay thy foundation by faith upon the rock Christ Jesus; look
   to Christ through all, and rest upon Christ in all.

   Secondly, "Labor to see an excellency in the power of godliness," a
   beauty in the life of Christ, If the means of grace have a loveliness
   in them, surely grace itself hath much more; for, "the goodness of the
   means lies in its suitableness and serviceableness to the end." The
   form of godliness hath no goodness in it any farther than it steads and
   becomes useful to the soul in the power and practice of godliness. The
   life of holiness is the only excellent life; it is the life of saints
   and angels in heaven; yea, it is the life of God in himself. As it is a
   great proof of the baseness and filthiness of sin, that sinners seek to
   cover it; so it is a great proof of the excellency of godliness that so
   many pretend to it. The very hypocrite's fair profession pleads the
   cause of religion, although the hypocrite is then really worst, when he
   is seemingly best.

   Thirdly, "Look upon things to come as the greatest realities;" for
   things that are not believed work no more upon the affections than if
   they had no being; and this is the grand reason why the generality of
   men suffer their affections to go after the world, setting the creature
   in the place of God in their hearts.

   Most men judge of the reality of things by their visibility and
   proximity to sense; and, therefore, the choice of that wretched
   cardinal becomes their option, who would not leave his part in Paris
   for his part in Paradise. Sure, whatever his interest might be in the
   former, he had little enough in the latter. Well may covetousness be
   called idolatry, when it thus chooses the world for its god.

   O! consider--eternity is no dream; hell and the worm that never dies,
   is no melancholy conceit. Heaven is no feigned Elysium; there is the
   greatest reality imaginable in these things; though they are spiritual,
   and out of the ken of sense, yet they are real, and within the view of
   faith. "Look not therefore at the things which are seen, but look at
   the things which are not seen; for the things that are seen are
   temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."

   Fourthly, "Set a high rate upon thy soul." What we lightly prize, we
   easily part with. Many men sell their souls at the rate of profane
   Esau's birth-right, for a morsel of bread;" nay, "for that which," in
   the sense of the Holy Ghost, "is not bread." O consider thy soul is the
   most precious and invaluable jewel in the world; it is the most
   beautiful piece of God's workmanship in the whole creation; it is that
   which bears the image of God, and which was bought with the blood of
   the Son of God; and shall we not set a value upon it, and count it
   precious?

   The apostle Peter speaks of three very precious things:--

   1. A precious Christ.

   2. Precious Promises.

   3. Precious Faith.

   Now, the preciousness of all these lies in their usefulness to the
   soul. Christ is precious, as being the redeemer of precious souls,--the
   Promises are precious, as making over this precious Christ to precious
   souls,--Faith is precious, as bringing a precious soul to close with a
   precious Christ, as he is held forth in the precious promises. O take
   heed that thou art not found overvaluing other things, and undervaluing
   thy soul. Shall thy flesh, nay thy beast, be loved, and shall thy soul
   be slighted? Wilt thou clothe and pamper thy body, and yet take no care
   of thy soul? This is, as if a man should feed his dog, and starve his
   child. "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will
   destroy both it and them." O let not a tottering, perishing carcass
   have all your time and care, as if the life and salvation of thy soul
   were not worth the while.

   Lastly, "Meditate much on the strictness and suddenness of that
   judgment-day, through which thou and I must pass into an everlasting
   state; wherein God, the impartial judge, will require an account at our
   hands of all our talents and intrustments." We must then account for
   time, how we have spent that; for estate, how we have employed that;
   for strength, how we have laid out that; for afflictions and mercies,
   how they have been improved; for the relations we stood in here, how
   they have been discharged; and for seasons and means of grace, how they
   have been husbanded. And look, how "we have sowed here, we shall reap
   hereafter."

   Reader, these are things that of all others deserve most of, and call
   loudest for, our utmost care and endeavors, though by the most least
   minded. To consider what a spirit of atheism of we may judge the tree
   by the fruits, and the principle by the practice) the hearts of most
   men are filled with, who live, as if God were not to be served, nor
   Christ to be sought, nor lust to be mortified, nor self to be denied,
   nor the Scripture to be believed, nor the judgment-day to be minded,
   nor hell to be feared, nor heaven to be desired, nor the soul to be
   valued; but give up themselves to a worse than brutish sensuality, "to
   work all uncleanness with greediness," living without God in the
   world--this is a meditation fit enough to break our hearts, if at least
   we were of holy David's temper, who "beheld the transgressors, and was
   grieved," and had "rivers of waters running down his eyes, because men
   kept not God's laws."

   The prevention and correction of this soul-destroying distemper, is not
   the least design of this Treatise now put into thy hand. Though the
   chief virtue of this receipt lies in its sovereign use to assuage and
   cure the swelling tympany of hypocrisy, yet it may serve also, with
   God's blessing, as a plaster for the plague-sore of profaneness, if
   timely applied by serious meditation, and carefully kept on by constant
   prayer.

   Reader, expect nothing of curiosity or quaintness, for then I shall
   deceive thee; but if thou wouldst have a touch-stone for the trial of
   thy state, possibly this may serve thee. If thou art either a stranger
   to a profession, or a hypocrite under a profession, then read and
   tremble, for thou art the man here pointed at.

   --Mutato nomine de te
   Fabula narratur.--Horat.

   But if the kingdom of God be come with power into thy soul; if Christ
   be formed in thee; if thy heart be upright and sincere with God, then
   read and rejoice.

   I fear I have transgressed the bounds of an epistle. The mighty God,
   whose prerogative it is to teach to profit, whether by the tongue or
   the pen, by speaking or writing, bless this tract, that it may be to
   thee as a cloud of rain to the dry ground, dropping fatness to thy
   soul, that so thy fleece being watered with the "dew of heaven," thou
   mayest "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
   Jesus Christ." In whom I am thy

   Friend and Servant,

    THE

ALMOST CHRISTIAN DISCOVERED.
     __________________________________________________________________

Introduction

   Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
   Acts xxvi. 28.

   IN this chapter you have the apostle Paul's apology and defensive plea,
   which he makes for himself against those blind Jews which so
   maliciously prosecuted him before Agrippa, Festus, Bernice, and the
   council. In which plea he chiefly insists upon three things.

   1. The manner of his life before conversion.

   2. The manner of his conversion.

   3. The manner of his life after conversion. How he lived before
   conversion, he tells you, ver. 4-13. How God wrought on him to
   conversion, he tells you, ver. 13-18. How he lived after conversion, he
   tells you, ver. 19-23. Before conversion he was very pharisaical. The
   manner of his conversion was very wonderful. The fruit of his
   conversion was very remarkable.

   Before conversion he persecuted the gospel which others preached after
   conversion, he preached the gospel which himself had persecuted.

   While he was a persecutor of the gospel, the Jews loved him; but now
   that, by the grace of God, he was become a preacher of the gospel, now
   the Jews hate him, and sought to kill him.

   He was once against Christ, and then many were for him; but now that he
   was for Christ, all were against him; his being an enemy to Jesus, made
   others his friends; but when he came to own Jesus, then they became his
   enemies. And this was the great charge they had against him, that of a
   great opposer he was become a great professor. Because God had changed
   him, therefore this enraged them: as if they would be the worse,
   because God had made him better. God had wrought on him by grace, and
   they seem to envy him the grace of God. He preached no treason, nor
   sowed no sedition; only he preached repentance, and faith in Christ,
   and the resurrection, and for this he was "called in question."

   This is the breviate and sum of Paul's defence and plea for himself,
   which, you find in the sequel of the chapter, had a different effect
   upon his judges.

   Festus seems to censure him, ver. 24. Agrippa seems to be convinced by
   him, ver. 28. The whole bench seem to acquit him, ver. 30, 31. Festus
   thinks Paul was beside himself. Agrippa is almost persuaded to be such
   a one as himself.

   Festus thinks him mad, because he did not understand the doctrine of
   Christ and the resurrection: "much learning hath made thee mad."
   Agrippa is so affected with his plea, that he is almost wrought into
   his principle: Paul pleads so effectually for his religion, that
   Agrippa seems to be upon the turning point to his profession. "Then
   Agrippa said to Paul, almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."

   "Almost."----The words make some debate among the learned. I shall not
   trouble you with the various hints upon them by Valla, Simplisius,
   Beza, Erasmus, and others. I take the words as we read them, and they
   show what an efficacy Paul's doctrine had upon Agrippa's conscience.
   Though he would not be converted, yet he could not but be convinced his
   conscience was touched, though his heart was not renewed.

   Observation. There is that in religion, which carries its own evidence
   along with it even to the consciences of ungodly men.

   "Thou persuadest me."--The word is from the Hebrew, and it signifies
   both suadere and persuadere; either to use arguments to prevail, or to
   prevail by the arguments used. Now it is to be taken in the latter
   sense here, to show the influence of Paul's argument upon Agrippa,
   which had almost proselyted him to the profession of Christianity.
   "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."

   "A Christian."--I hope I need not tell you what a Christian is, though
   I am persuaded many that are called Christians, do not know what a
   Christian is, or if they do, yet they do not know what it is to be a
   Christian. A Christian is a disciple of Jesus Christ, one that believes
   in, and. follows Christ. As one that embraces the doctrine of Arminius,
   is called an Arminian; and he that owns the doctrine and way of Luther,
   is called a Lutheran; so he that embraces, and owns, and follows the
   doctrine of Jesus Christ, he is called a Christian.

   The word is taken more largely, and more strictly: more largely, and so
   all that profess Christ come in the flesh, are called Christians, in
   opposition to heathens that do not know Christ; and to the poor blind
   Jews, that will not own Christ; and to the Mahometan, that prefers
   Mahomet, above Christ. But now in Scripture, the word is of a more
   strict and narrow acceptation, it is used only to denominate the true
   disciples and followers of Christ; "the disciples were first called
   Christians at Antioch; if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be
   ashamed;" that is, as a member and disciple of Christ; and so in the
   text, "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."

   The word is used but in these three places, as I find, in all the New
   Testament, and in each of them it is used in the sense afore-mentioned.

   The Italians make the name to be a name of reproach among them, and
   usually abuse the word Christian to signify a fool. But if, as the
   apostle saith, "the preaching of Christ is to the world foolishness,"
   then it is no wonder that the disciples of Christ are to the world
   fools. Yet it is true; in a sound sense, that so they are; for the
   whole of godliness is a mystery. A man must die, that would live; he
   must be empty, that would be full; he must be lost, that would be
   found; he must have nothing, that would have all things; he must be
   blind, that would have illumination; he must be condemned, that would
   have redemption; so he must be a fool that would be a Christian. "If
   any man among you seems to be wise, let him become a fool, that he may
   be wise." He is the true Christian that is the world's fool, but wise
   to salvation.

   Thus you have the sense and meaning of the words briefly explained. The
   text needs no division, and yet it is a pity the almost should not be
   divided from the Christian. Though it is of little avail to divide them
   as they are linked in the text, unless I could divide them as they are
   united in your hearts; this would be a blessed division, if the almost
   might be taken from the Christian that so you may not be only
   propemodum, but admodum; not only almost, but altogether Christians.
   This is God's work to effect it, but is our duty to persuade to it; and
   O that God would help me to manage this subject so, that you may say,
   in the conclusion, "Thou persuadest me, not almost, but altogether to
   be a Christian!"

   The observation that I shall propound to handle is this:

   Doctrine. There are very many in the world that are almost, and yet but
   almost Christians; many that are near heaven, and yet are never the
   nearer; many that are within a little of salvation, and yet shall never
   enjoy the least salvation; they are within sight of heaven, and yet
   shall never have a sight of God.

   There are two sad expressions in Scripture, which I cannot but take
   notice of in this place. The one is concerning the truly righteous. The
   other is concerning the seemingly righteous.

   It is said of the truly righteous, he shall "scarcely be saved;" and it
   is said of the seemingly righteous, he shall be almost saved: "Thou art
   not far from the kingdom of God."

   The righteous shall be saved with a scarcely, that is, through much
   difficulty; he shall go to heaven through many sad fears of hell. The
   hypocrite shall be saved with an almost, that is, he shall go to hell
   through many fair hopes of heaven.

   There are two things which arise from hence of very serious meditation.
   The one is, how often a believer may miscarry, how low he may fall, and
   yet have true grace. The other is, how far a hypocrite may go in the
   way to heaven, how high, he may attain, and yet have no grace.

   The saint may be cast down very near to hell, and yet shall never come
   there; and the hypocrite may be lifted up very near to heaven, and yet
   never come there. The saint may almost perish, and yet be saved
   eternally; the hypocrite may almost be saved, and vet perish finally.
   For the saint at worst is really a believer, and the hypocrite at best
   is really a sinner.

   Before I handle the doctrine, I must premise three things, which are of
   great use for the establishing of weak believers, that they may not be
   shaken and discouraged by this doctrine.

   First, There is nothing in the doctrine that should be matter of
   stumbling or discouragement to weak Christians. The gospel doth not
   speak these things to wound believers, but to awaken sinners and formal
   professors.

   As there are none more averse than weak believers, to apply the
   promises and comforts of the gospel to themselves, for whom they are
   properly designed; so there are none more ready than they to apply the
   threats and severest things of the word to themselves, for whom they
   were never intended. As the disciples, when Christ told them, "One of
   you shall betray me;" they that were innocent suspected themselves
   most, and therefore cry out, "Master, is it I?" So weak Christians,
   when they hear sinners reproved, or the hypocrite laid open, in the
   ministry of the word, they presently cry out, "Is it I?"

   It is the hypocrite's fault to sit under the trials and discoveries of
   the word, and yet not to mind them: and it is the weak Christian's
   fault to draw sad conclusions of their own state from premises which
   nothing concern them.

   There is indeed great use of such doctrine as this is to all believers:

   1. To make them look to their standing, upon what foundation they are,
   and to see that the foundation of their hope be well laid, that they
   build not upon the sand, but upon a rock.

   2. It helps to raise our admiration of the distinguishing love of God,
   in bringing us into the way everlasting, when so many perish from the
   way, and in overpowering our souls into a true conversion, when so many
   take up with a graceless profession.

   3. It incites to that excellent duty of heart-searching, that so we
   approve ourselves to God in sincerity.

   4. It engages the soul in double diligence, that it may be found not
   only believing, but persevering in faith to the end.

   These duties, and such as these, make this doctrine of use to all
   believers; but they ought not to make use of it as a stumbling-block in
   the way of their peace and comfort.

   My design in preaching on this subject, is not to make sad the souls of
   those whom Christ will not have made sad; I would bring water not to
   "quench the flax that is smoking," but to put out that false fire that
   is of the sinner's own kindling, lest walking all his days by the light
   thereof, he shall at last "lie down in sorrow." My aim is to level the
   mountain of the sinner's confidence, not to weaken the hand of the
   believer's faith and dependence; to awaken and bring in secure formal
   sinners, not to discourage weak believers.

   Secondly, I would premise this; though many may go far, very far in the
   way to heaven, and yet fall short, yet that soul that hath the least
   true grace shall never fall short; "the righteous shall hold on his
   way."

   Though some may do very much in a way of duty, as I shall show
   hereafter, and yet miscarry; yet that soul that doth duty with the
   least sincerity, shall never miscarry; "for he saveth the upright in
   heart."

   The least measure of true grace is as saving as the greatest; it saves
   as surely, though not so comfortably. The least grace gives a full
   interest in the blood of Christ, whereby we are thoroughly purged; and
   it gives a full interest in the strength and power of Christ, whereby
   we shall be certainly preserved.

   Christ keeps faith in the soul, and faith keeps the soul in Christ; and
   so "we are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation."

   Thirdly, I would premise this; they that can hear such truths as this,
   without serious reflection and self-examination, I must suspect the
   goodness of their condition.

   You will suspect that man to be next door to a bankrupt, that never
   casts up his accounts nor looks over his book; and I as verily think
   that man a hypocrite, that never searches nor deals with his own heart.
   He that goes on in a road of duties without any uneasiness or doubting
   of his state, I doubt no man's state more than his.

   When we see a man sick, and yet not sensible, we conclude the tokens of
   death are upon him. So when sinners have no sense of their spiritual
   condition, it is plain that they are dead in sin; the tokens of eternal
   death are upon them. These things being premised, which I desire you
   would carry along in your mind while we travel through this subject, I
   come to speak to the proposition more distinctly and closely.

   Doctrine. That there are very many in the world that are almost, and
   yet but almost Christians.

   I shall demonstrate the truth of the proposition, and then proceed to a
   more distinct prosecution.

   I. I shall demonstrate the truth of the proposition; and I shall do it
   by scripture-evidence, which speaks plainly and fully to the case.

   First, The young man in the gospel is an eminent proof of this truth;
   there you read of one that came to Christ to learn of him the way to
   heaven: "Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have
   eternal life?" Our Lord Christ tells him, "If thou wilt enter into
   life, keep the commandments:" and when Christ tells him which, he
   answers, "Lord, all these I have kept from my youth up; what lack I
   yet?"

   Now do but see how far this man went.

   1. He obeyed--he did not only hear the commands of God, but he kept
   them; now the Scripture saith, "Blessed is he that hears the word of
   God, and keeps it."

   2. He obeyed universally--not this or that command, but both this and
   that; he did not halve it with God, or pick and choose which were
   easiest to be done, and leave the rest; no, but he obeys all: "All
   these things have I kept."

   3. He obeyed constantly--not in a fit of zeal only, but in a continual
   series of duty; his goodness was not, as Ephraim's, "like the morning
   dew that passes away;" no, All these things have I kept from my youth
   up."

   4. He professeth desire to know and do more--to perfect that which was
   lacking of his obedience: and therefore he goes to Christ to instruct
   him in his duty; "master, what lack I yet?" Now would you not think
   this a good man? Alas! how few go this far? And yet as far as he went,
   he went not far enough; "he was almost, and yet but almost a
   Christian;" for he was an unsound hypocrite; he forsakes Christ at
   last, and cleaves to his lust. This then is a full proof of the truth
   of the doctrine.

   Second, A second proof of it is that of the parable of the virgins in
   St. Matthew: see what a progress they make, how far they go in a
   profession of Christ.

   1. They are called "virgins."--Now this is a name given in the
   Scripture, both in the Old Testament and the New, to the saints of
   Christ: "The virgins love thee:" so in the revelation, the "one hundred
   forty and four thousand" that stood with the Lamb on Mount Zion, are
   called "virgins." They are called virgins, because they are not defiled
   with the "corruptions that are in the world through lust." Now these
   here seem to be of that sort, for they are called virgins.

   2. They take their lamps--that is, they make a profession of Christ.

   3. They had some kind of oil in their lamps. They had some convictions
   and some faith, though not the faith of God's elect, to keep their
   profession alive, to keep the lamp burning.

   4. They went--their profession was not an idle profession; they did
   perform duties, frequented ordinances, and did many things commanded:
   they made a progress--they went.

   5. They went forth--they went and outwent, they left many behind them;
   this speaks out their separation from the world.

   6. They went with the "wise virgins"--they joined themselves to those
   who had joined themselves to the Lord, and were companions of them that
   were companions of Christ.

   7. They go "forth to meet the bridegroom"--this speaks out their owning
   and seeking after Christ.

   8. When they heard the cry of the bridegroom coming, "they arose and
   trimmed their lamps;" they profess Christ more highly, hoping now to go
   in with the bridegroom.

   9. They sought for true grace. Now do not we say, the desires of grace
   are grace? and so they are, if true and timely; if sound and
   seasonable. Why lo here a desire of grace in these virgins, "Give us of
   your oil."

   It was a desire of true grace, but it was not a true desire of grace;
   it was not true, because not timely; unsound, as being unseasonable; it
   was too late. Their folly was in not taking oil when they took their
   lamps; their time of seeking grace was when they came to Christ; it was
   too late to seek it when Christ came to them. They should have sought
   for that when they took up their profession: it was too late to seek it
   at the coming of the bridegroom. And therefore "they were shut out;"
   and though they cry for entrance, "Lord, Lord, open to its;" yet the
   Lord Christ tells them, "I know you not."

   You see how far these virgins go in a profession of Jests Christ, and
   how long they continue in it, even till the bridegroom came; they go to
   the very door of heaven, and there, like the Sodomites, perish with
   their hands upon the very threshold of glory. They were almost
   Christians, and yet but almost; almost saved, and yet perish.

   You that are professors of the gospel of Christ, stand and tremble: if
   they that have gone beyond us fall short of heaven, what shall become
   of us that fall short of them? If they that are virgins, that profess
   Christ, that have some faith in their profession, such as it is, that
   have some fruit in their faith, that outstrip others that seek Christ,
   that improve their profession, and suit themselves to their
   profession--nay, that seek grace; if such as these be but almost
   Christians, Lord, what are we?

   Third, If these two witnesses be not sufficient to prove the truth, and
   confirm the credit of the proposition, take a third; and that shall be
   from the Old Testament, Isaiah lviii. 2. See what God saith of that
   people; he gives them a very high character for a choice people, one
   would think: "They seek me daily; they delight to know my ways, as a
   nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their
   God; they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in
   approaching to God."

   See how far these went; if God had not said they were rotten and
   unsound, we should have taken them for the "he-goats before the flock,"
   and ranked them among the worthies. Pray observe,

   1. They seek God.--Now this is the proper character of a true saint--to
   seek God. True saints are called, "seekers of God." "This is the
   generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob;" or, O
   God of Jacob. Lo, here a generation of them that seek God; and are not
   these the saints of God?--Nay, farther,

   2. They seek him daily.--Here is diligence backed with continuance, day
   by day; that is, every day, from day to day. They did not seek him by
   fits and starts, nor in a time of trouble and affliction only, as many
   do. "Lord, in trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer
   when thy chastening was upon them." Many when God visits them, then
   they visit him, but not till then; when God poureth out his
   afflictions, then they pour out their supplications. This is seamen's
   devotion; when the storms have brought them to "their wits' end, then
   they cry to the Lord in their trouble." Many never cry to God, till
   they are at their wits' end; they never come to God for help, so long
   as they can help themselves. But now these here, whom. God speaks of,
   are more zealous in their devotion; the others make a virtue of
   necessity, but these seem to make conscience of duty; for, saith God,
   "they seek me daily." Sure this is, one would think, a note of
   sincerity. Job saith of the hypocrite, "Will he always call upon God?"
   Surely not; but now this people call upon God always, "they seek him
   daily;" certainly these are no hypocrites.

   3. Saith God, "They delight to know my ways." Sure this frees them from
   the suspicion of hypocrisy; for, they say not unto God, "Depart from
   us; we desire not the knowledge of thy ways."

   4. They are "as a nation that did righteousness." Not only as a nation
   that spake righteousness, or knew righteousness, or professed
   righteousness; but as a nation that did righteousness, that practised
   nothing but what was just and right. They appeared, to the judgment of
   the world, as good as the best.

   5. They forsook not the ordinances of their God--They seem true to
   their principles, constant to their profession, better than many among
   us, that cast off duties, and forsake the ordinances of God: but these
   hold out in their profession; "they forsook not the ordinances of God."

   6. "They ask of me," saith God, "the ordinances of justice." They will
   not make their own will the rule of right and wrong, but the law and
   will of God: and therefore, in all their dealings with men, they desire
   to be guided and counselled by God: "They ask of me the ordinances of
   justice."

   7. They take delight in approaching to God. Sure this cannot be the
   guise of a hypocrite. "Will he delight himself in the Almighty?" saith
   Job:--no, he will not. Though God is the chief delight of man, (having
   everything in him to render him lovely, as was said of Titus
   Vespasian,) yet the hypocrites will not delight in God. Till the
   affections are made spiritual, there is no affection to things that are
   spiritual. God is a spiritual good, and therefore hypocrites cannot
   delight in God. But these are a people that delight in approaching to
   God.

   8. They were a people that were much in fasting: "Wherefore have we
   fasted," say they, "and thou seest not?" Now this is a duty that doth
   not suppose and require truth of grace only in the heart, but strength
   of grace.

   "No man," saith our Lord Christ, "puts new wine into old bottles, lest
   the bottles break and the wine run out." New wine is strong, and old
   bottles weak; and the strong wine breaks the weak vessel: this is a
   reason Christ gives, why his disciples, who were newly converted, and
   but weak as yet, were not exercised with this austere discipline. But
   this people here mentioned were a people that fasted often, afflicted
   their souls much, wore themselves out by frequent practices of
   humiliation. Sure therefore this was "new wine in new bottles;" this
   must needs be a people strong, in grace; there seems to be grace not
   only in truth, but also in growth. And yet, for all this, they were no
   better than a generation of hypocrites; they made a goodly progress,
   and went far, but yet they went not far enough; they were cast off by
   God after all.

   I hope by this time the truth of the point is sufficiently avouched and
   confirmed; "that a man may be, yea, very many are, almost, and yet no
   more than but almost Christians."

   Now for the more distinct prosecution of the point.

   1. I shall show you, step by step, how far he may go, to what
   attainments he may reach, how specious and singular a progress he may
   make in religion, and yet be but almost a Christian when all is done.

   2. I will show whence it is, that many men go so far as that they are
   almost Christians.

   3. Why they are but almost Christians when they have gone thus far.

   4. What the reason is, why men that go thus far as to be almost
   Christians, yet go no farther than to be almost Christians.
     __________________________________________________________________

QUESTION I.

   How far may a man go in the way to heaven, and yet be but almost a
   Christian?

   Answer. This I will show you in twenty several steps.

   I. A man may have much knowledge, much light; he may know much of God
   and his will, much of Christ and his ways, and yet be but almost a
   Christian.

   For though there can be no grace without knowledge, yet there may be
   much knowledge where there is no grace; illumination often goes before,
   when conversion never follows after. The subject of knowledge is the
   understanding; the subject of holiness is the will. Now a man may have
   his understanding enlightened, and yet his will not at all sanctified.
   He may have an understanding to know God, and yet want a will to obey
   God. The apostle tells us of some, that, "when they knew God, they
   glorified him not as God."

   To make a man altogether a Christian, there must be light in the head,
   and beat in the heart; knowledge in the understanding, and zeal in the
   affections. Some have zeal and no knowledge; that is, blind devotion;
   some have knowledge and no zeal; that is, fruitless speculation: but
   where knowledge is joined with zeal, that makes a true Christian.

   Objection. But is it not said, This is life eternal--to know thee, the
   only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent?"

   Answer. It is not every knowledge of God and Christ, that interests the
   soul in life eternal. For why then do the devils perish; they have more
   knowledge of God than all the men in the world; for though, by their
   fall, they lost their holiness, yet they lost not their knowledge. They
   are called daimones, from their knowledge, and yet they are diaboloi,
   from their malice, devils still.

   Knowledge may fill the head, but it will never better the heart, if
   there be not somewhat else. The Pharisees had much knowledge: "Behold,
   thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of
   God, and knowest his will," &c., and yet they were a generation of
   hypocrites. Alas! how many have gone loaded with knowledge to hell!

   Though it is true, that it is life eternal to know God and Jesus
   Christ; yet it is as true, that many do know God and Jesus Christ, that
   shall never see life eternal. There is, you must know, a twofold
   knowledge; the one is common, but not saving; the other is not common,
   but saving: common knowledge is that which floats in the head, but does
   not influence the heart. This knowledge, reprobates may have; "Balaam
   saw Christ from the top of the rocks, and from the hills."

   Naturalists say, that there is a pearl in the toad's head, and yet her
   belly is full of poison. The French have a berry which they call uve de
   spine, the grape of a thorn. The common knowledge of Christ is the
   pearl in the toad's head--the grape that grows upon thorns; it may be
   found in men unsanctified.

   And then there is a saving knowledge of God and Christ, which includes
   the assent of the mind, and the consent of the will; this is a
   knowledge that implies faith; "By his knowledge shall my righteous
   servant justify many." And this is that knowledge which leads to life
   eternal: now whatever that measure of knowledge is, which a man may
   have of God, and of Jesus Christ, yet if it be not this saving
   knowledge--knowledge joined with affection and application--he is but
   almost a Christian.

   He only knows God aright, who knows how to obey him, and obeys
   according to his knowledge of him: "A good understanding have all they
   that do his commandments." All knowledge without this makes a man but
   like Nebuchadnezzar's image, with "a head of gold, and feet of clay."

   Some know, but to know.

   Some know, to be known.

   Some know, to practise what they know.

   Now, to know, but to know--that is curiosity.

   To know, to be known--that is vain glory.

   But to know, to practise what we know--that is gospel duty. This makes
   a man a complete Christian; the other, without this, makes a man
   almost, and yet but almost a Christian.

   II. A man may have great and eminent gifts, yea, spiritual gifts, and
   yet be but almost a Christian.

   The gift of prayer is a spiritual gift. Now this a man may have, and
   yet be but almost a Christian: for the gift of prayer is one thing; the
   grace of prayer is another. The gift of preaching and prophesying is a
   spiritual gift; now this a man may have, and yet be but almost a
   Christian. Judas was a great preacher.; so were they that came to
   Christ, and said, "Lord, Lord, we have prophesied in thy name, and in
   thy name have cast out devils," &c.

   You must know that it is not gifts, but grace, which makes a Christian:
   For,

   1. Gifts are from a common work of the Spirit. Now a man may partake of
   all the common gifts of the Spirit, and yet be a reprobate; for
   therefore they are called common, because they are indifferently
   dispensed by the Spirit to good and bad; to them that are believers,
   and to them that are not.

   They that have grace have gifts; and they that have no grace, may have
   the same gifts; for the Spirit works in both; nay, in this sense he
   that hath no grace, may be under a greater work of the Spirit (quod
   hoc) as to this thing, than he that hath most grace; a graceless
   professor may have greater gifts than the most holy believer: he may
   out-pray, and out-preach, and out-do them; but they in sincerity and
   integrity out-go him.

   2. Gifts are for the use and good of others, they are given in ordinem
   alium, as the schoolmen speak, for the profiting and edifying of
   others: so says the apostle, "they are given to profit withal." Now a
   man may edify another by his gifts, and yet be unedified. himself; he
   may be profitable to another, and yet unprofitable to himself.

   The raven was an unclean bird: God makes use of her to feed Elijah;
   though she was not good meat, yet it was good meat she brought. A lame
   man may with his crutch point to the right way, and yet not be able to
   walk in it himself. A crooked tailor may make a suit to fit a straight
   body, though it fit not him that made it, because of his crookedness.
   The church (Christ's garden inclosed) may be watered through a wooden
   gutter; the sun may give light through a dusky window; and the field
   may be well sowed with a dirty hand.

   The efficacy of the word doth not depend upon the authority of him that
   speaks it, but upon the authority of God that blesses it. So that
   another may be converted by my preaching, and yet I may be cast away
   notwithstanding. Balaam makes a clear and rare prophecy of Christ, and
   yet he hath no benefit by Christ: "There shall come a star out of
   Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel;"---but yet Balaam shall
   have no benefit by it: "I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold
   him, but not nigh."

   God may use a man's gifts to bring another to Christ, when he himself,
   whose gifts God uses, may be a stranger unto Christ; one man may
   confirm another in the faith, and yet himself may be a stranger to the
   faith. Pendleton strengthens and confirms Sanders, in Queen Mary's
   days, to stand in the truth he had preached, and to seal it with his
   blood, and yet afterwards plays the apostate himself.

   Scultetus tells us of one Johannes Speiserus, a famous preacher of
   Augsburg in Germany, in the year 1523, who preached the gospel so
   powerfully that divers common harlots were converted, and became good
   Christians; and yet himself afterwards turned papist and came to a
   miserable end. Thus the candle may burn bright to light others in their
   work, and yet afterwards go out in a stink.

   3. It is beyond the power of the greatest gifts to change the heart; a
   man may preach like an apostle, pray like an angel, and yet may have
   the heart of a devil. It is grace only that can change the heart; the
   greatest gifts cannot change it, but the least grace can; gifts may
   make a man a scholar, but grace makes a man a believer. Now if gifts
   cannot change the heart, then a man may have the greatest gifts, and
   yet be but almost a Christian.

   4. Many have gone laden with gifts to hell; no doubt Judas had great
   gifts, for he was a preacher of the gospel; and our Lord Jesus Christ
   would not set him to work, and not fit him for the work; yet "Judas is
   gone to his own place:" the Scribes and Pharisees were men of great
   gifts, and yet, "where is the wise? where is the scribe?"

   "The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness." Them
   that perish, who are they? Who I the wise and the learned, both among
   Jews and Greeks; these are called "them that perish." A great bishop
   said, when he saw a poor shepherd weeping over a toad: "The poor
   illiterate world attain to heaven, while we with all our learning fall
   into hell."

   There are three things must be done for us, if ever we would avoid
   perishing.

   We must be thoroughly convinced of sin.

   We must be really united to Christ.

   We must be instated in the covenant of grace.

   Now, the greatest gifts cannot stead us in any of these.

   They cannot work thorough convictions.

   They cannot effect our union.

   They cannot bring us into covenant-relation.

   And consequently, they cannot preserve us from eternally perishing; and
   if so, then a man may have the greatest gifts, and yet be but almost a
   Christian.

   5. Gifts may decay and perish: they do not lie beyond the reach of
   corruption; indeed grace shall never perish, but gifts will: grace is
   incorruptible, though gifts are. not; grace is "a spring, whose waters
   fail not," but the streams of gifts may be dried up. If grace be
   corruptible in its own nature, as being but a creature, yet it is
   incorruptible in regard of its conserver, as being the new creature; he
   that did create it in us, will conserve it in us; he that did begin it
   will also finish it.

   Gifts have their root in nature, but grace hath its roots in Christ;
   and therefore though gifts may die and wither, yet grace shall abide
   forever. Now if gifts are perishing, then, though he that hath the
   least grace is a Christian, he that hath the greatest gifts may be but
   almost a Christian.

   Objection. But doth not the apostle bid us "covet earnestly the best
   gifts?" Why must we covet them, and covet them earnestly, if they avail
   not to salvation?

   Answer. Gifts are good, though they are not the best good; they are
   excellent, but there is somewhat more excellent, so it follows in the
   same verse, "Yet I show unto you a more excellent way," and that is the
   way of grace. One dram of grace is more worth than a talent of gifts:
   gifts may make us rich towards men, but it is grace that makes us "rich
   towards God." Our gifts profit others, but grace profits ourselves;
   that whereby I profit another is good, but that by which I am profited
   myself is better.

   Now because gifts are good, therefore we ought to covet them; but
   because they are not the best good, therefore we ought not to rest in
   them: we must covet gifts for the good of others, that they may be
   edified; and we must covet grace for the good of our own souls, that
   they may be saved; for whosoever be bettered by our gifts, yet we shall
   miscarry without grace.

   III. A man may have a high profession of religion, be much in external
   duties of godliness, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Mark what our Lord tells them, "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
   Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven;" that is, not every one
   that makes a profession of Christ, shall therefore be owned for a true
   disciple of Christ. "All are not Israel that are of Israel;" nor are
   all Christians that make a profession of religion.

   What a godly profession had Judas! he followed Christ, left all for
   Christ, he preached the gospel of Christ, he cast out devils in the
   name of Christ, he eat and drank at the table of Christ; and yet Judas
   was but a hypocrite.

   Most professors are like lilies, fair in show, but foul in scent; or
   like pepper, hot in the mouth, but cold in the stomach. The finest lace
   may be upon the coarsest cloth.

   It is a great deceit to measure the substance of our religion by the
   bulk of our profession, and to judge of the strength of our graces by
   the length of our duties. The Scriptures speak of some who having "a
   form of godliness, yet deny the power thereof." Deny the power; that
   is, they do not live in the practice of those graces to which they
   pretend in their duties; he that pretends to godliness by a specious
   profession, and yet doth not practise godliness by a holy conversation,
   he hath a form, but denies the power." Grotius compares such to the
   ostrich, which hath great wings, but yet flies not. Many have the wings
   of a fair profession, but yet use them not to mount upward in spiritual
   affections, and a heavenly conversation.

   But to clear the truth of this, that a man may make a high profession
   of religion, and yet be but almost a Christian, take a fourfold
   evidence.

   1. If a man may profess religion, and yet never have his heart changed,
   nor his state bettered, then he may be a great professor, and yet be
   but almost a Christian. But a man may profess religion, and yet never
   have his heart changed, nor his state renewed. He may be a constant
   hearer of the word, and yet be a sinner still; he may come often to the
   Lord's table, and yet go away a sinner as he came; we must not think
   that duties can confer grace.

   Many a soul hath been converted by Christ in an ordinance, but never
   was any soul converted by an ordinance without Christ. And doth Christ
   convert all that sit under the ordinances? Surely not; for to some,
   "the word is a savor of death unto death." And if so, then it is plain,
   that a man may profess religion, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   2. A man may profess religion, and live in a form of godliness in
   hypocrisy. "Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the
   name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah; which
   swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel,
   but not in truth, nor in righteousness." What do you think of these?
   "They make mention of the name of the Lord, there is their profession
   but not in truth; nor in righteousness," there is their dissimulation:
   and indeed there could be no hypocrisy in a religious sense, were it
   not for a profession of religion; for he that is wicked and carnal, and
   vile inwardly, and appears to be so outwardly, he is no hypocrite, but
   is what he appears, and appears what lie is. But he that is one thing
   really, and another thing seemingly, is carnal and unholy, and yet
   seems to be good and holy, he is a hypocrite.

   Thus the Casuists define hypocrisy to be a counterfeiting of holiness;
   and this fits exactly with the Greek word, which is, to counterfeit.

   And to this purpose, the Hebrews have two words for hypocrites; panim,
   which signifies faces; and chanepim, which signifies counterfeits; from
   chanaph, to dissemble: so that he is a hypocrite that dissembles
   religion, and weareth the face of holiness, and yet is without the
   grace of holiness. He appears to be in semblance, what he is not in
   substance; he wears a form of godliness without, only as a cover of a
   profane heart within. He hath a profession that he may not be thought
   wicked; but it is but a profession, and therefore he is wicked. He is
   the religious hypocrite; religious, because he pretends to it; and yet
   a hypocrite, because he doth but pretend to it. He is like many men in
   a consumption, that have fresh looks, and yet rotten lungs; or like an
   apple that hath a fair skin, but a rotten core. Many appear righteous,
   who are, only righteous in appearance. And if so, then a man may
   profess religion, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   3. Custom and fashion may make a man a professor; as you have many that
   wear this or that garb, not because it keeps them warmer, or hath any
   excellency in it more than another, but merely for fashion.

   Many must have powdered hair, spotted faces, feathers in their caps,
   &c. for no other end, but because they would be fools in fashion. So,
   many profess Christianity--not because the means of grace warm the
   heart, or that they see any excellencies in the ways of God above the
   world, but--merely to follow the fashion! I wish I might not say, it
   hath been true of our days, because religion hath been uppermost,
   therefore many have professed; it hath been the gaining trade, and then
   most will be of that trade.

   Religion in credit makes many professors, but few proselytes; but when
   religion suffers, then its confessors are no more than its converts;
   for custom makes the former, but conscience the latter. He that is a
   professor of religion merely for custom-sake, when it prospers, will
   never be a martyr for Christ's sake, when religion suffers. He that
   owns the truth, to live upon that, will disown it, when it comes to
   live upon him.

   They say, that when a house is decaying or falling, all the rats and
   mice will forsake it; while the house is firm, and they may shelter in
   the roof, they will stay, but no longer; lest, in the decay, the fall
   should be upon them, and they that lived at top should die at bottom.
   My brethren, may I not say, we have many that are the vermin, the rats
   and mice of religion, that would live under the roof of it, while they
   might have shelter in it; but when it suffers, forsake it, lest it
   should fall, and the fall should be upon them? I am persuaded this is
   not the least reason why God hath brought the wheel upon the profession
   of religion; namely to rid it of the vermin. He shakes the foundations
   of the house, that these rats and mice may quit the roof; not to
   overturn it, but to rid them of it; as the husbandman fans the wheat,
   that he may get rid of the chaff. The halcyon days of the gospel
   provoke hypocrisy, but the sufferings for religion prove sincerity.

   Now, then, if custom and fashion make many men professors, then a man
   may profess religion, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   4. If many may perish under a profession of godliness, then a man may
   profess religion and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Now, the Scripture is clear, that a man may perish under the highest
   profession of religion. Christ cursed the fig-tree, that had leaves and
   no fruit. It is said, that "the children of the kingdom shall be cast
   out into outer darkness." Who were these, but they that were then the
   only people of God in the world by profession, that had made a
   "covenant with him by sacrifice"--and yet these were cast out.

   In St. Matthew, you read of some that came and made boast of their
   profession to Christ, hoping that might save them. "Lord," say they,
   "have we not prophesied in thy name, cast out devils in thy name, done
   many wonderful works in thy name?" Now what saith our Lord Christ to
   this? "Then I will profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from
   me."

   Mark, here are they that prophesy in his name, and yet perish in his
   wrath; in his name cast out devils, and then are cast out themselves;
   in his name do many wonderful works, and yet perish for wicked workers.
   The profession of religion will no more keep a man from perishing, than
   calling a ship the Safe-guard, or the Good-speed, will keep her from
   drowning. As many go to heaven with the fear of hell in their hearts,
   so many go to hell with the name of Christ in their mouths. Now then,
   if many may perish under a profession of godliness, then may a man be a
   high professor of religion, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Objection. But is it not said by the Lord Christ himself, "He that
   confesses me before men, him will I confess before my Father in
   heaven?" Now, for Christ to say, he will confess us before the Father,
   is equivalent to a promise of eternal life: for if Jesus Christ confess
   us, God the Father will never disown us.

   True, they that confess Christ, shall be confessed by him; and it is as
   true, that this confession is equivalent to a promise of salvation. But
   now you must know, that professing Christ, is not confessing him: for
   to profess Christ is one thing --to confess Christ is another.
   Confession is a living testimony for Christ, in a time when religion
   suffers; profession may be only a lifeless formality, in a time when
   religion prospers. To confess Christ, is to choose his ways, and own
   them. To profess Christ, is to plead for his ways, and yet live beside
   them. Profession may be from a feigned love to the ways of Christ; but
   confession is from a rooted love to the person of Christ. To profess
   Christ, is to own him when none deny him; to confess Christ, is to
   plead for him, and. suffer for him, when others oppose him. Hypocrites
   may be professors; but the martyrs are the true confessors. Profession
   is a swimming down the stream. Confession is a swimming against the
   stream. Now many may swim with the stream, like the dead fish, that
   cannot swim against the stream, with the living fish. Many may profess
   Christ, that cannot confess Christ; and so, notwithstanding their
   profession, yet are but almost Christians.

   IV. To come yet nearer; a man may go far in opposing his sin, and yet
   be but almost a Christian.

   How far a man may go in this work, I shall show you in seven gradual
   instances.

   First, A man may be convinced of sin, and yet be but almost a
   Christian: for,

   1. Conviction may be rational, as well as spiritual; it may be from a
   natural conscience enlightened by the word, without the effectual work
   of the Spirit, applying sin to the heart.

   2, Convictions may be worn out; they many times go off, and end not in
   sound conversion. Saith the church, "We have been with child, we have
   been in pain, we have brought forth wind." This is the complaint of the
   church, in reference to the unprofitableness of their afflictions; and
   it may be the complaint in most, in reference to the unprofitableness
   of their convictions.

   3. Many take conviction of sin, to be conversion from sin; and to sit
   down and rest in their convictions. That is a sad complaint God makes
   of Ephraim "Ephraim is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in
   the place of the breaking forth of children." Now then, if convictions
   may be only from natural conscience; if they may be worn out, or may be
   mistaken, and rested in for conversion, then a man may have
   convictions, and be but almost a Christian.

   Secondly, A man may mourn for sin, and yet be but almost a Christian.
   So did Saul; so did Esau, for the loss of his birthright, which was his
   sin, and therefore he is called, by the Spirit of God, "profane Esau;"
   yet, "he sought it again carefully with tears."

   Objection. But doth not Christ pronounce them blessed that mourn?
   "Blessed are they that mourn." Sure then, if a man mourn for sin, he is
   in a good condition: you see, saith Nazianzen, that salvation is joined
   with sorrow.

   Solution. I answer, it is true, that they who mourn for sin, in the
   sense Christ there speaks of, are blessed; but all mourning for sin,
   doth not therefore render us blessed.

   1. True mourning for sin must flow from spiritual convictions of the
   evil, and vileness, and damnable nature of sin. Now, all that mourn for
   sin, do not do it from a thorough work of spiritual conviction upon the
   soul; they have not a right sense of the evil and vileness of sin.

   2. True mourning for sin, is more for the evil that is in sin, than the
   evil that comes by sin; more because it dishonors God, and wounds
   Christ, and grieves the Spirit, and makes the soul unlike God, than
   because it damns the soul. Now there are many that mourn for sin, not
   so much for the evil that is in it, as for the evil that it brings with
   it; there is mourning for sin in hell; you read of "weeping and
   wailing" there. The damned are weeping and mourning to eternity; there,
   is all sorrow, and no comfort. As in heaven there is peace without
   trouble, joy without mourning; so in hell there is trouble without
   peace, mourning without joy, weeping and wailing incessantly; but it is
   for the evil they feel by sin, and not for the evil that is in sin; so
   that a man may mourn for sin, and yet be but almost a Christian: it may
   grieve him to think of perishing for sin, when it does not grieve him
   that he is defiled and polluted by sin.

   Thirdly, A man may make large confession of sin, to God, to others, and
   yet be but almost a Christian.

   How ingenuously doth Saul confess his sin to David? "I have sinned,"
   saith he, "thou art more righteous than I! Behold, I have played the
   fool, and have erred exceedingly." So Judas makes a full confession: "I
   have sinned in betraying innocent blood." Yet Saul and Judas were both
   rejected of God; so that a man may confess sin, and yet be but almost a
   Christian.

   Objection. But is not a confession of sin a character of a child of
   God? Doth not the apostle say, "If we confess our sins, God is just and
   faithful to forgive them;" no man was ever kept out of heaven for his
   confessed badness, though many are kept out of heaven for their
   supposed goodness.

   Judah, in. Hebrew, signifies confession; now Judah got the kingdom from
   Reuben; confession of sin is the way to the kingdom of heaven.

   There are some that confess sin, and are saved; there are others that
   confess sin, and perish.

   1. Many confess sin merely out of custom, and not out of conscience;
   you shall have many that will-never pray, but they will make a long
   confession of sin, and yet never feel the weight or burden of it upon
   their consciences.

   2. Many will confess lesser sins, and yet conceal greater; like the
   patient in Plutarch, that complained to his physician of his finger,
   when his liver was rotten.

   3. Many will confess sin in the general, or confess themselves sinners;
   and yet see little, and say less of their particular sins; an implicit
   confession, as one saith, is almost as bad as an implicit faith.

   Where confession is right, it will be distinct, especially of those
   sins that were our chief sins. So David confesses his blood-guiltiness
   and adultery: so Paul his blasphemy, persecution, and injury against
   the saints. It is bad to hear men confess they are great sinners, and
   yet cannot confess their sins. Though the least sin be too bad to be
   committed, yet there is no sin too bad to be confessed.

   4. Many will confess sin, but it is only under extremity, that is, not
   free and voluntary. Pharaoh confesses his sin, but it was when judgment
   compelled him. "I have sinned against the Lord," saith he; but it was
   when he had had eight plagues upon him.

   5. Many do by their sins as mariners do by their goods, cast them out
   in a storm, wishing for them again in a calm. Confession should come
   like water out of a spring, which runs freely; not like water out of a
   still, which is forced by fire.

   6. Many confess their sins, but with no intent to forsake sin; they
   confess the sins they have committed, but do not leave the sins they
   have confessed.

   Many men use their confession as Lewis the eleventh of France did his
   crucifix; he would swear an oath, and then kiss it; and swear again,
   and then kiss it again. So many sin, and then confess they do not well,
   but yet never strive to do better.

   Mr. Torsel tells a story of a minister he knew, that would be often
   drunk, and when he came into the pulpit, would confess it very
   lamentingly; and yet no sooner was he out of the pulpit, but he would
   be drunk again; and this would he do as constantly as men follow their
   trades.

   Now then, if a man may confess sin merely out of custom; if he may
   confess lesser sins, and yet conceal greater; if he may confess sin
   only in the general, or only under extremity, or if he may confess sin
   without any intent to forsake sin, then surely a man may confess sin,
   and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Fourthly, A man may forsake sin, and yet be but almost a Christian; he
   may leave his lust, and his wicked ways, which he sometimes lived in,
   and in the judgment of the world become a new man, and yet not be a new
   creature. Simon Magus, when he hears Philip preaching concerning the
   kingdom of God, leaves his sorcery and witchcraft, and believes.

   Objection. But you will say, this seems contrary to Scripture; for that
   says, "He that confesseth and forsaketh sin, shall have mercy;" but I
   confess sin, yea, not only so, but also I forsake sin; sure therefore
   this mercy is my portion, it belongs to me.

   Answer. It is true, that where a soul forsakes sin from a right
   principle, after a right manner, to a right end; where he forsakes sin
   as sin, as being contrary to God, and the purity of his nature--this
   declares that soul to be right with God, and the promise shall be made
   good to it, "He shall find mercy."

   But now pray mind, there is a forsaking sin that is not right, but
   unsound.

   1. Open sins may be deserted, and yet secret sins may be retained; now
   this is not a right forsaking; such a soul shall never find mercy. A
   man may be cured of a wound in his flesh, and yet may die of an
   imposthume in his bowels.

   2. A man may forsake sin, but not as sin; for he that forsakes sin as
   sin, forsakes all sin. It is impossible for a man to forsake sin as
   sin, unless he forsakes all that he knows to be sin.

   3. A man may let one sin go to hold another the faster; as a man that
   goes to sea, would willingly save all his goods; but if the storm
   arises that he cannot, then he throws some overboard to lighten the
   vessel, and save the rest. So did they, Acts xxvii. 38. So the sinner
   chooses to keep all his sins; but if a storm arises in his conscience,
   why then he will heave one lust overboard, to save the life of another.

   4. A man may let all sin go, and yet be a sinner still; for there is
   the root of all sin in the heart, though the fruit be not seen in the
   life; the tree lives, though the boughs be lopped off. As a man is a
   sinner, before ever he acts sin, so (till grace renews him) he is a
   sinner, though he leaves sin; for there is original sin in him enough
   to damn and destroy him.

   5. Sin may be left, and yet be loved; a man may forsake the life of
   sin, and yet retain the love of sin: now, though leaving sin makes him
   almost a Christian, yet loving sin shows he is but almost a Christian.
   It is a less evil to do sin, and not love it, than to love sin and not
   do it; for to do sin may argue only weakness of grace, but to love sin
   argues strength of lust. "What I hate, that I do." Sin is bad in any
   part of man, but sin in the affection is worse than sin in the
   conversation; for sin in the conversation may be only from infirmity,
   but sin in the affection is the fruit of choice and unregeneracy.

   6. All sin may be chained, and yet the heart not changed; and so the
   nature of the sinner is the same as ever. A dog chained up, is a dog
   still, as much as if he was let loose to devour.

   There may be a cessation of arms between enemies, and yet the quarrel
   may remain on foot still: there may be a making truce, where there is
   no making peace.

   A sinner may lay the weapons of sin out of his hand, and yet the enmity
   against God still remain in his heart. There may be a truce--he may not
   sin against him; but there can be no peace till he be united to him.

   Restraining grace holds in the sinner, but it is renewing grace that
   changes his nature. Now. many are held in by grace from being open
   sinners, that are not renewed by grace, and made true believers.

   Now then, if a man may forsake open sins, and retain secret sins; if he
   may forsake sin, but not as sin; if he may let one sin go, to hold
   another the faster; if a man may let all sin go, and yet be a sinner
   still; if sin may be left, and yet be loved: finally, if all sin may be
   chained, and yet the heart not changed;--then a man may forsake sin,
   and yet be but almost a Christian.

   V. A man may hate sin, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Absalom hated Amnon's uncleanness with his sister Tamar: yea, his
   hatred was so great, that he slew him for it; and yet Absalom was but a
   wicked man.

   Objection. But the Scripture makes it a sign of a gracious heart, to
   hate sin; yea, though a man do, through infirmities, fall into sin, yet
   if he hates it, this is a proof of grace. Paul proves the sincerity of
   his heart, and the truth of his grace, by this hatred of sin, though he
   committed it: "What I hate, that I do." Nay, what is grace but a
   conformity of the soul to God; to love as God loves, to hate as God
   hates? Now God hates sin: it is one part of his holiness to hate all
   sin. And if I hate sin, then am I conformed to God: and if I am
   conformed to God, then am I altogether a Christian.

   Answer. It is true, that there is a hatred of sin, which is a sign of
   grace, and which flows from a principle of grace, and is grace. As for
   instance:

   To hate sin, as it is an offence to God, a wrong to his majesty; to
   hate 'sin, as it is a breach of the command, and so a wicked
   controlling of God's will, which is the only rule of goodness; to hate
   sin, as being a disingenuous transgression of that law of love
   established in the blood and death of Christ, and so, in a degree, a
   crucifying of Christ afresh. To hate sin, as being a grieving and
   quenching the Spirit of God, as all sin in its nature is.--Thus to hate
   sin, is grace; and thus every true Christian hates sin.

   But, though every man that hath grace hates sin, yet every man that
   hates sin hath not grace: for, a man may hate sin from other
   principles, not as it is a wrong to God, or a wounding Christ, or a
   grieving the Spirit; for then he would hate all sin; for there is no
   sin but hath this in the nature of it. But,

   1. A man may hate sin for the shame that attends it, more than for the
   evil that is in it. Some sinners there are, "who declare their sin as
   Sodom, and hide it not." They are set down in the seat of the scornful;
   "they glory in their shame." But now others there are who are ashamed
   of sin, and therefore hate it, not for the sin's sake, but for the
   shame's sake. This made Absalom hate Amnon's uncleanness, because it
   brought shame upon him and his sister.

   2. A man may hate sin more in others, than in himself: so doth the
   drunkard--he hates drunkenness in another, and yet practises it
   himself! the liar hates falsehood in another, but likes it himself. Now
   he that hates sin from a principle of grace, hates sin most in himself;
   he hates sin in others, but he loathes most the sins of his own heart.

   3. A man may hate one sin as being contrary to another. There is a
   great contrariety between sin and sin, between lust and lust; it is the
   excellency of the life of grace, that it is a uniform life; there is no
   one grace contrary to another. The graces of God's Spirit are
   different, but not differing. Faith, and love, and holiness, are all
   one: they consist together at the same time, in the same subject; nay,
   they cannot be parted. There can be no faith without love, no love
   without holiness; and so, on the other hand, no holiness without love;
   no love without faith. So that this makes the life of grace an easy and
   excellent life; but now the life of sin is a distracting contradictious
   life, wherein a man is a servant to contrary lusts: the lust of pride
   and prodigality is contrary to the lust of covetousness, &c. Now, where
   one lust gets to be the master-lust of the soul, then that works a
   hatred of its contrary. Where covetousness gets the heart, there the
   heart hates pride; and where pride gets uppermost in the heart, there
   the heart hates covetousness. Thus a man may hate sin, not from a
   principle of grace, but from the contrariety of lust. He does not hate
   any sin, as it is sin; but he hates it, as being contrary to his
   beloved sin.

   Now then, if a man may hate sin for the shame that attends it; if he
   may hate sin more in others than himself; if he may hate one sin as
   being contrary to another;--then he may hate sin, and yet be but almost
   a Christian.

   VI. A man may make great vows and promises--he may have strong purposes
   and resolutions against sin, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Thus did Saul; he promises and resolves against his sin: "Return, my
   son David," saith he, "for I will no more do thee harm." What promises
   and resolves did Pharaoh make against that sin of detaining God's
   people?--saith he, "I will let the people go, that they may do
   sacrifice to the Lord." And again, "I will let ye go, and ye shall stay
   no longer." And yet Saul and Pharaoh both perished in their sins. The
   greatest purposes and promises against sin will not make a man a
   Christian: for,

   1. Purposes and promises against sin, never hurt sin: we say,
   "threatened folks live long;" and truly so do threatened sins. It is
   not new purposes, but a new nature, that must help us against sin:
   purposes may bring to the birth, but without a new nature, there is no
   strength to bring forth. The new nature is the best soil for holy
   purposes to grow in; otherwise, they wither and die, like plants in an
   improper soil.

   2. Troubles and afflictions may provoke us to large purposes and
   promises against sin for the future. What more common, than to vow, and
   not to pay? to make vows in the day of trouble, which we make no
   conscience to pay in the day of grace? Many covenant against sin, when
   trouble is upon them; and then sin against their covenant, when it is
   removed from them. It was a brave rule that Pliny, in one of his
   epistles, gave his friend to live by, "That we should continue to be
   such when we are well, as we promise to be when we are sick." Many are
   our sick-bed promises, but we are no sooner well, than we grow sick of
   our promises.

   3. Purposes and resolves against sin for the future, may be only a
   temptation to put off repentance for the present. Satan may put a man
   on to good purposes, to keep him from present attempts. He knows
   whatever we purpose, yet the strength of performance is not in
   ourselves. He knows, that purposes for the future are a putting God off
   for the present; they are a secret will not, to a present opportunity.
   That is a notable passage, "Follow me," saith Christ, to the two men.
   Now see what answers they gave to Christ;--"Suffer me first to go and
   bury my father," says one. This man purposes to follow Christ, only he
   would stay to bury his father. Says the other, "Lord, I will follow
   thee, but let me first go and bid them farewell which are at my house:"
   I will follow thee, but only I would first go and take my leave of my
   friends, or set my house in order; and yet we do not find that ever
   they followed Christ notwithstanding their fair purposes.

   4. Nature unsanctified may be so far wrought on, as to make great
   promises and purposes against sin.

   1st, A natural man may have great convictions of sin, from the workings
   of an enlightened conscience.

   2d, He may approve of the law of God.

   3d, He may have a desire to be saved.

   Now these three together--the workings of conscience; the sight of the
   goodness of the law; a desire to be saved,--may bring forth in a man
   great purposes against sin, and yet he may have no heart to perform his
   own purposes. This was much like the case of them--say they to Moses,
   "Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say: and tell
   thou it to us, and we will hear it, and do it." This is a fair promise,
   and so God takes it: "I have heard the words of this people; they have
   well said all they have spoken." So said, and so done, had been well;
   but it was better said than done; for though they had a tongue to
   promise, yet they had no heart to perform; and this God saw: therefore
   said he, "O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear
   me, and keep my commandments always, that it might be well with them!"
   They promised to fear God, and keep his commandments; but they wanted a
   new heart to perform what an unsanctified heart had promised. It fares
   with men in this case, as it did with that son in the gospel, that
   said, He would go into the vineyard, but went not."

   Now then, if purposes and promises against sin, never hurt sin; if
   present afflictions may draw out large promises; if they may be the
   fruit of a temptation--or, if from nature unsanctified surely then a
   man may promise and purpose much against sin, and yet be but almost a
   Christian.

   VII. A man may maintain a strife and combat against sin in himself, and
   yet be but almost a Christian. So did Balaam when he went to curse the
   people of God, he had a great strife within himself. "How shall I
   curse," saith he, "whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy whom
   the Lord hath not defied?" And did not Pilate strive against his sin,
   when he said to the Jews, "Shall I crucify your king? what evil hath he
   done. I am innocent of the blood of this just man."

   Objection. But you will say, "Is not this an argument of grace, when
   there is a striving in the soul against sin? for what should oppose sin
   in the heart but grace? The apostle makes "the lusting of the flesh
   against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh," to be an
   argument of grace in the heart. Now I find this strife in my heart,
   though the remainders of corruption sometimes break out into actual
   sins, yet I find a striving in my soul against sin.

   Answer. It is true, there is a striving against sin, which is only from
   grace, and is proper to believers; and there is a striving against sin,
   which is not from grace, and therefore may be in them that are not
   believers.. There is a strife against sin in one and the same faculty;
   the will against the will--the affection against the affection; and
   this is that which the apostle calls "the lusting of the flesh against
   the spirit;" that is, the striving of the unregenerate part against the
   regenerate; and this is ever in the same faculty, and is proper to
   believers only.

   An unbeliever never finds this strife in himself. This strife cannot be
   in him; it is impossible, as such; that is, while he is on this side a
   state of grace. But then there is a striving against sin in divers
   faculties; and this is the strife that is in them that are not
   believers. There, the strife is between the will and the conscience;
   conscience enlightened and terrified with the fear of hell and
   damnation--that is against sin the will and affection, not being
   renewed, they are for sin. And this causes great tugging and combats
   many times in the sinner's heart. Thus it was with the Scribes and
   Pharisees. Conscience convinced them of the divinity of Christ, and of
   the truth of his being the Son of God; and yet a perverse will, and
   carnal affections, cry out, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"--Conscience
   pleaded for him. He had a witness in their bosoms; and yet their wills
   were bent against him: and therefore they are said "to have resisted
   the Spirit;" namely, the workings and convictions of the Spirit in
   their consciences. And this is the case of many sinners: when the will
   and affections are for sin, and plead for it, conscience is against it,
   and many times frights the soul from the doing of it. And hence men
   take that which opposes sin in them to be grace, when it is only the
   work of a natural conscience. They conclude the strife is between grace
   and sin--the regenerate and unregenerate part; when, alas.! it is no
   other than the contention of a natural conscience against a corrupt
   will and affections.--And if so, then a man may have great strifes and
   combats against sin in him; and yet be but almost a Christian.

   5. A man may desire grace, and yet be but almost a Christian. So did
   the five foolish virgins: "Give us of your oil." What was that but true
   grace? It was that oil that lighted the wise virgins into the
   bridegroom's chamber. They do not only desire to enter in, but they
   desire oil to light them in. Wicked men may desire heaven--desire a
   Christ to save them; there is none so wicked upon earth, but desire to
   be happy in heaven. But now here are they that desire grace as well as
   glory, and yet these are but almost Christians.

   Objection. But is it not commonly taught that desires of grace are
   grace? nay, doth not our Lord Christ make it so?--"Blessed are they
   that hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled."

   Answer. It is true, that there are some desires of grace which are
   grace: as,

   1. When a man desires grace from a right sense of his natural state;
   when he sees the vileness of sin, and the woful, defiled, and loathsome
   condition he is in by reason of sin; and therefore desires the grace of
   Christ to renew and change him,--this is grace. This some make to be
   the lowest degree of saving faith.

   2. When a man joins proportionable endeavors to his desires; doth not
   only wish for grace, but work for grace; such desires are grace.

   3. When a man's desires are constant and incessant, that cease not but
   in the attainment of their object; such desires are true grace. They
   are a part of the especial work of the Spirit. They do really partake
   of the nature of grace; now it is a known maxim, "that which partakes
   of the nature of the whole, is a part of the whole;" the filings of
   gold are gold. The sea is not more really water, than the least drop;
   the flame is not more really fire than the least spark.

   But though all true desires of grace, are grace yet all desires of
   grace, are not true: for,

   1. A man may desire grace, but not for itself, but for somewhat else;
   not for grace's sake, but for heaven's sake: he doth not desire grace,
   that his nature may be changed, his heart renewed, the image of God
   stamped upon him, and his lusts subdued in him. These are blessed
   desires, found only in true believers. The true Christian only can
   desire grace for grace's sake; but the almost Christian may desire
   grace for heaven's sake.

   2. A man may desire grace without proportionable endeavors after grace;
   many are good at wishing, but bad at working; like him that lay in the
   grass on a summer's day, crying out, "O that this were to work?"
   Solomon saith, "The desire of the slothful kills him." How so? "For his
   hands refuse to labor;" He perisheth in his desires. The believer joins
   desires and endeavors together: "One thing have I desired of the Lord,
   and that will I seek after."

   3. A man's desires of grace may be unseasonable: thus the foolish
   virgins desired oil when it was too late. The believer's desires are
   seasonable; he desires grace in the season of grace, and seeks in a
   time when it may be found. "The wise man's heart knows both time and
   judgment." He knows his season, and hath wisdom to improve it. The
   silly sinner doth all his works out of season he sends away the seasons
   of grace, and then desires grace when the season is over. The sinner
   doth all too late; as Esau desired the blessing when it was too late,
   and therefore he lost it; whereas, had he come sooner, he had obtained
   it. Most men are like Epimetheus, wise too late, they come when the
   market is done; when the shop is closed, then they have their oil to
   get. When they lie upon their death-beds, then they desire holy hearts.

   4. Desires of grace in many are very inconstant and fleeting, like the
   "morning dew, that quickly passes away:" or like Jonah's gourd, that
   springs up in a night, and withers in a night: they have no root in the
   heart, and therefore quickly perish. Now, if a man may desire grace,
   but not for grace's sake; if desires may be without endeavors; if a man
   may desire grace when it is too. late; if these desires may be but
   fleeting and inconstant; then may a man desire grace, and yet be but
   almost a Christian.

   5. A man may tremble at the word of God and yet be but almost a
   Christian, as Belshazzar did at the handwriting upon the wall.

   Objection. But is not that a note of sincerity and truth of grace, to
   tremble at the word? Both not God say, "To him will I look that is of a
   poor and contrite spirit, and trembles at my word?"

   Answer. There is a two-fold trembling.

   1. One is, when the word discovers the guilt of sin, and the wrath of
   God that belongs to that guilt; this, where conscience is awake, causes
   trembling and amazement: thus, when Paul preached of righteousness and
   judgment, it is said Felix trembled.

   2. There is a trembling which arises from a holy dread and reverence of
   the majesty of God, speaking in his word; this is only found in true
   believers, and is that which keeps the soul low in its own eyes.
   Therefore mark how the words run: "To him will I look that is of a poor
   and contrite spirit, and trembles at my word." God does not make the
   promise to him that trembles at the word; for the devils believe and
   tremble; the word of God can make the proudest, stoutest sinner in the
   world to shake and tremble,--but it is "to the poor and contrite spirit
   that trembles." Where trembling is the fruit of a spirit broken for
   sin, and low in its own eyes; there will God look. Now many tremble at
   the word, but not from poverty of spirit, not from a heart broken for
   sin, and low in its own eyes;, not from a sense of the majesty and
   holiness of God: and therefore, notwithstanding they tremble at the
   word, yet they are but almost Christians.

   3. A man may delight in the word and ordinances of God, and yet be but
   almost a Christian: "They take delight in approaching to God." And it
   is said of that ground, that it "received the word with joy," and yet
   it was but "stony ground."

   Objection. But is it not made a character of a godly man, to delight in
   the word of God? Doth not David say, "He is a blessed man that delights
   in the law of the Lord?"

   Answer. There is a delighting in the word, which flows from grace, and
   is a proof of blessedness.

   1. He that delights in the word, because of its spirituality, he is a
   Christian indeed; the more spiritual the ordinances are, the more doth
   a gracious heart delight in them.

   2. When the word comes close to the conscience, rips up the heart, and
   discovers sin, and yet the soul delights in it notwithstanding; this is
   a sign of grace.

   3. When delight arises from that communion that is to be had with God
   there, this is from a principle of grace in the soul.

   But there may be a delight in the word, where there is no grace.

   1. There are many who delight in the word because of the eloquence of
   the preacher: they delight not so much in the truth delivered, as in
   the dress in which they are delivered. Thus it is said of the prophet
   Ezekiel, that he was to them "as a very lovely song of one that hath a
   pleasant voice."

   2. There are very many who delight to hear the word, that yet take no
   delight to do it: so saith God of them, "They delight to hear my words,
   but they do them not."

   Now then, if a man may delight in the word, more because of the
   eloquence of the preacher, than because of the spirituality of the
   matter; if he may delight to hear the word, and yet not delight to do
   it,--then he may delight in the word, and yet be but almost a
   Christian.

   VIII. A man may be a member of the church of Christ, he may join
   himself to the people of God, partake with them in all ordinances, and
   share of all church privileges, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   So the five foolish virgins joined themselves to the wise, and walked
   together. Many may be members of the church of Christ, and yet not
   members of Christ, the head of the church. There was a mixed multitude
   came up with the church of Israel out of Egypt: they joined themselves
   to the Israelites, owned their God, left their own country, and yet
   were in heart Egyptians notwithstanding; "All are not Israel, that are
   of Israel."

   The church in all ages hath had unsound members: Cain had communion
   with Abel; Ishmael dwelt in the same house with Isaac; Judas was in
   fellowship with the apostles; and so was Demas with the rest of the
   disciples. There will be some bran in the finest meal: the drag-net of
   the Gospel catches bad fish as well as good; the tares and the wheat
   grow together, and it will be so till the harvest.

   God hath a church where there are no members but such as are true
   members of Christ, but it is in heaven, it is the "church of the
   first-born;" there are no hypocrites, nor rotten, unsound professors,
   none but the "spirits of just men made perfect:" all is pure wheat that
   God layeth up in that garner; there the chaff is separated to
   unquenchable fire.

   But in the church on earth the wheat and the chaff lie in the same heap
   together; the Samaritans will be near of kin to the Jews when they are
   in prosperity: so while the church of God flourisheth in the world,
   many will join to it; they will seem Jews, though they are Samaritans;
   and seem saints, though yet they are no better than almost Christians.

   IX. A man may have great hopes of heaven, great hopes of being saved,
   and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Indeed there is a hope of heaven which is "the anchor of the soul sure
   and steadfast," it never miscarries, and it is known by four
   properties.

   First, It is a hope that purifies the heart, purges out sin: "He that
   hath this hope, purifies himself even as God is pure." That soul that
   truly hopes to enjoy God, truly endeavors to be like God.

   Secondly, It is a hope which fills the heart with gladness: "We rejoice
   in hope of the glory of God."

   Thirdly, It is a hope that is founded upon the promise: as there can be
   no true faith without a promise, so, nor any true hope. Faith applies
   the promise, and hope expects the fulfilling the promise: faith relies
   upon the truth of it, and hope waits for the good of it; faith gives
   interest, hope expects livery and seisin.

   Fourthly, It is a hope that is wrought by God himself in the soul; who
   is therefore called, "the God of hope," as being the Author as well as
   the Object of hope. Now, he that hath this hope shall never miscarry.
   This is a right hope; the hope of the true believer: "Christ in you,
   the hope of glory." But then, as there is a true and sound hope, so
   there is a false and rotten hope; and this is much more common, as
   bastard-pearls are more frequently worn than true pearls.

   There is nothing more common, than to see men big with groundless hopes
   of heaven: as,

   1. A man may have great hope that hath no grace; you read of the "hope
   of hypocrites." The performance of duties is a proof of their hope; the
   foolish virgins would never have done what they did, had they thought
   they should have been shut out after all. Many professors would not be
   at such pains in duties as they are, if they did not hope for heaven.
   Hope is the great motive to action: despair cuts the sinews of all
   endeavors. That is one reason why the damned in hell cease acting
   toward an alteration of their state, because despair hath taken hold of
   them: if there were any hope in hell, they would up and be doing there.
   So that there may be great hope where there is no grace; experience
   proves this; formal professors are men of no grace, but yet men of
   great hopes; nay, many times you shall find that none fear more about
   their eternal condition, than they that have most cause of hope, and
   none hope more than they that have most cause of fear. As interest in
   hope may sometimes be without hope, so hope in God may be without
   interest.

   2. A man may hope in the mercy, and goodness, and power of God, without
   eyeing the promise; and this is the hope of most: God is full of mercy
   and goodness, and therefore willing to save; and he is infinite in
   power, and therefore able to save; why therefore should I not rest on
   him?

   Now it is presumption, and therefore sin, to hope in the mercy of God,
   otherwise than by eyeing the promise; for the promise is the channel of
   mercy, through which it is conveyed; all the blessedness the saints
   enjoy in heaven, is no other than what is the fruit of promise relied
   on, and hoped for here on earth. A man hath no warrant to hope in God,
   but by virtue of the promise.

   3. A man may hope for heaven, and yet not cleanse his heart, nor depart
   from his secret sins; that hope of salvation that is not accompanied
   with heart-purification, is a vain hope.

   4. A man may hope for heaven, and yet be doing the work of hell; he may
   hope for salvation, and yet be working out his own damnation, and so
   perish in his confidences. This is the case of many, like the water-man
   that looks one way, and rows another; many have their eyes on heaven
   whose hearts are in the earth; they hope in God, but choose him not for
   a portion; they hope in God, but do not love him as the best good, and
   therefore are like to have no portion in him, nor good by him; but are
   like to perish without him, notwithstanding all their hopes: "What is
   the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God takes away
   his soul?"

   Now then, if a man may have great hope of heaven, that hath no grace;
   if he may hope in mercy, without eyeing the promise; if he may hope
   without heart-purifying; if he may hope for heaven, and yet do the work
   of hell; surely then a man may have great hopes of heaven, and yet be
   but almost a Christian.

   X. A man may be under great and visible changes, and these wrought by
   the ministry of the word, and yet be but almost a Christian, as Herod
   was. It is said, "when he heard John Baptist, he did many things, and
   heard him gladly." Saul was under a great change when he met the Lord's
   prophets; he turned prophet too. Nay, it is said, verse 9th of that
   chapter, that "God gave him another heart." Now, was not this a work of
   grace? and was not Saul here truly converted? One would think he was;
   but yet indeed he was not. For though it is said, God gave him another
   heart, yet it is not said, that God gave him a new heart. There is a
   great difference between another heart, and a new heart; God gave him
   another heart to fit him for a ruler, but gave him not a new heart to
   make him a believer; another heart may make another man, but it is a
   new heart that makes a new man.

   Again Simon Magus is a great proof of this truth: he was under a great
   and visible change; of a sorcerer he was turned to be a believer; he
   left his witchcrafts and sorceries, and embraced the gospel; was not
   this a great change? If the drunkard doth but leave his drunkenness,
   the swearer his oaths, the profane person his profaneness, they think
   this is a gracious change, arid their state is now good. Alas! Simon
   Magus did not only leave his sins, but had a kind of conversion; for,
   he believed, and was baptized."

   Objection. But is not that man that is changed, a true Christian?

   Answer. Not every change makes a man a Christian: indeed there is a
   change, that whoever is under it is a true Christian.

   When a man's heart is so changed, as that it is renewed: when old
   things "are done away, and all is become new:" when the new creature is
   wrought in the soul, when a man is "turned from darkness to light, from
   the power of Satan to God;" when the mind is enlightened, the will
   renewed, the affections made heavenly: then a man is a Christian
   indeed.

   But now you must know that every change is not this change. For,

   1. There is a civil change, a moral change, as well as a spiritual and
   supernatural change.

   Many men are changed in a moral sense, and one may say, they are become
   new men; but they are in heart and nature the same men still. They are
   not changed in a spiritual and supernatural sense, and therefore it
   cannot be said of them, they are become new creatures.

   Restraining grace may cause a moral change; but it is renewing grace
   that must cause a saving change. Now, many are under restraining grace,
   and so changed morally, that are not under the power of saving grace,
   and so changed savingly.

   2. There is an outward change, as well as an inward change: the outward
   change is often without the inward, though the inward change is never
   without the outward. A man's heart cannot be sanctified, but it will
   influence the life; but a man's life may be reformed, and yet never
   affect or influence the heart.

   3. A man may be converted from a course of profaneness, to a form of
   godliness; from a filthy conversation, to a fair profession; and yet
   the heart be the same in one and the other. A rotten post may be gilt
   without, and yet unsound within. It is common to have the "outside of
   the cup and platter" made clean, and yet the inside foul and filthy.

   Now then, if a man may be changed morally, and yet not
   spiritually--outwardly, and yet not inwardly, from a course of
   profaneness to a lifeless form of godliness; then a man may be under
   great and visible changes, and yet be no more than almost a Christian.

   I do not speak this to discountenance any change, short of that which
   is spiritual; but to awaken you to seek after that change which is more
   than moral. It is good to be outwardly renewed, but it is better to be
   savingly renewed. I know how natural it is for men to take up with
   anything like a work of conversion, though it be not conversion and
   resting in that, they eternally perish.

   Beloved, let me tell you, there is no change, no conversion, can stead
   your souls in the day of judgment, on this side that saving work, which
   is wrought on the soul by the Spirit of God, renewing you throughout:
   the sober man, without this change, shall as surely go to hell, as the
   foolish drunkard. Morality and civility may commend us to men, but not
   to God. They are of no value in the procurement of an eternal
   salvation.

   A man may go far in an outward change, and yet be not one step nearer
   heaven, than he that was never under any change;--nay, he may be, in
   some sense, further off; as Christ saith, the Scribes and Pharisees
   were further from heaven, with all their show of godliness, than
   publicans and harlots, in all their sin and uncleanness. Because,
   resting in a false work, a partial change, we neglect to seek after a
   true and saving change. There is nothing more common than to mistake
   our state, and by overweening thoughts, misjudge our condition, and so
   perish in our own delusions. The world is full of these foolish
   builders, that lay the foundation of their hopes of eternal salvation
   upon the sand.

   Now, my brethren, would you not mistake the way to heaven, and perish
   in a delusion? Would you not be found fools at last? for none are such
   fools as the spiritual fool, who is a fool in thy; great business of
   salvation. Would you not be fools for your souls, and for eternity? O
   then labor after, and pray for, a thorough work of conversion! Beg of
   God that he would make a saving change in your souls, that ye may be
   altogether Christians! All other changes below this saving change, this
   heart change, make us but almost Christians.

   XI. A man may be very zealous in the matters of religion, and yet be
   but almost a Christian.

   Jehu did not only serve God, and do what he commanded him, but was very
   zealous in his service: "Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord of
   hosts!" and yet in all this Jehu was a very hypocrite. Joash was a
   great reformer in Jehoiada's time it is said, "He did that which was
   right in the sight of the Lord, all the days of Jehoiada the priest."
   But when Jehoiada died, Joash's zeal for God died with him, and he
   becomes a very wretch.

   Objection. But the apostle makes zeal to be a note of sound
   Christianity: "It is good to be zealously affected in good things;"
   nay, it seems to be the non-such qualification for obtaining eternal
   life; "The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take
   it by force."

   Answer. It is true, there is a zeal which is good, and which renders
   the soul highly acceptable to God--a zeal, that never misses of heaven
   and salvation. Now this is a zeal which is a celestial fire; the true
   temper and heat of all the affections to God and Christ. It is a zeal
   wrought and kindled in the soul by the Spirit of God, who first works
   it, and then sets it on work. It is a zeal that hath the word of God
   for its guide, directing it in working, both in regard of its object
   and end, manner and measure. It is a zeal that checks sin, and forwards
   the heavenly life. It is a zeal that makes the glory of God its chief
   end; which swallows up all by-ends: "The zeal of thy house hath eaten
   me up."

   But now all zeal is not this kind of zeal: there is a false zeal, as
   well as a true: every grace hath its counterfeit. As there is fire,
   which is true heavenly fire, on the altar, so there is strange fire:
   Nadab and Abihu offered strange fire upon God's altar.

   There are several kinds of zeal, none of which are true and sound, but
   false and counterfeit.

   I shall instance in eight particulars

   First, There is a blind zeal, a zeal without knowledge. "They have a
   zeal," saith the apostle, "but not according to knowledge." Now as
   knowledge without zeal is fruitless, so zeal without knowledge is
   dangerous. It is like wild-fire in the hand of a fool; or, like the
   devil in the man possessed, that threw him sometimes into the fire,
   sometimes into the water.

   The eye is the light of the body, and the understanding is the light of
   the soul. Now, as the body, without the light of the eye, cannot go
   without stumbling; so the soul, without the light of the mind, cannot
   act without erring. Zeal without knowledge, is like an ignis fatuus in
   a dark night, that leads a traveller out of his way, into the bogs and
   mire. This was the zeal of Paul, while he was a Pharisee: "I was
   zealous towards God, as ye are all this day; and I persecuted this way
   unto the death." And again, "I verily thought with myself, I ought to
   do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth." And,
   "Concerning zeal, persecuting the church." Such a zeal was that in
   John, "They shall put you out of the synagogue,"--silence you, you
   shall not be suffered to preach;--"yea, the time comes, that whoever
   kills you, will think that he doth God service." This is great zeal,
   but yet it is blind zeal; and that God abhors.

   Secondly, There is a partial zeal: in one thing, fire hot--in another
   key-cold; zealous in this thing, and yet careless in another. Many are
   first-table Christians, zealous in the duties of the first-table, and
   yet neglect the second. Thus the Pharisees were zealous in their
   Corban, and yet unnatural to their parents, suffering them to starve
   and perish. Others are second-table Christians, zealous in the duties
   of the second-table, but neglect the first; more for righteousness
   among men, than for holiness towards God. But now he whose religion
   ends with the first-table, or begins with the second, he is a fool in
   his profession; for he is but almost a Christian.

   The woman that was for the dividing the child, was not the true mother;
   and he that is for dividing the commands, is not a true believer.

   Jehu was zealous against Ahab's house, but not so against Jeroboam's
   calves; many are zealous against sin of opinion, that yet use no zeal
   against the sins of their conversation.

   Now, as we know that the sweat of the whole body is a sign of health,
   but the sweat of some one part only, shows a distemper, and therefore
   physicians do reckon such a heat to be symptomatical. So where zeal
   reaches to every command of God alike, that is a sign of a sound
   constitution of soul; but where it is partial, where a man is hot in
   one part, and cold in another, that is symptomatical of some inward
   spiritual distemper.

   Thirdly, There is a misplaced zeal; fixed upon unsuitable and
   disproportionable objects. Many are very zealous in trifling things
   that are not worth it, and trifling in the things that most require it;
   like the Pharisees that were diligent tythers of mint, anise, and
   cummin, but neglected the "weightier matters of the law; judgment,
   mercy, and faith." They had no zeal for these, though very hot for the
   other; many are more zealous for a ceremony, than for the substance of
   religion; more zealous for bowing at the name of Jesus, than for
   conformity to the life of Jesus; more zealous for a holy vestment, than
   for a holy life; more zealous for the inventions of men, than for the
   institutions of Christ. This is a superstitious zeal, and usually found
   in men unconverted, in whom grace never was wrought. Against such men
   heathens will rise up in judgment. When. was it that Paul was so
   "exceeding zealous of the traditions of his fathers.," as he saith, but
   only when he was in his wretched and unconverted state? as you may see
   in the next verses: "But when it pleased God to call me by his grace,
   then I conferred not with flesh and blood." Paul had another kind of
   zeal then, actuated by other kind of principles.

   Fourthly, There is a selfish zeal, that hath a man's own end for its
   motive; Jehu was very zealous, but it was not so much for God, as for
   the kingdom; not so much in obedience to the command, as in design to
   step into the throne; and therefore God threatens to punish him for
   that very thing he commands him to do: "I will avenge the blood of
   Jezreel upon the house of Jehu:" because he shed that blood, to gratify
   his lust, not to obey God. So Simeon and Levi pretend great zeal for
   circumcision, seem very zealous for the honor of God's ordinances, when
   in truth their zeal was covetousness, and revenge upon the Shechemites.

   Fifthly, There is an outside zeal: such was that of the Scribes and
   Pharisees; they would not eat with unwashed hands, but yet would live
   in unseen sins; they would wash the cup often, but the heart seldom;
   paint the outside, but neglect the inside. Jehu was a mighty outside
   reformer, but he reformed nothing within, for he had a base heart under
   all. "Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord with all his
   heart." Though his fleece was fair, his liver was rotten. Our Lord
   Christ observes of the Pharisees, "They pray, to be seen of men;" and
   fast, so "that they may appear to men to fast."

   Sixthly, There is a forensic zeal, that runs out upon others; like the
   candle in the lantern, that sends all the heat out at the top; or as
   the lewd woman Solomon mentions, whose "feet abide not in her own
   house."

   Many are hot and high against the sins of others, and yet cannot see
   the same in themselves; like the Lamiae, that put on their spectacles
   when they went abroad, but pulled them of within doors.

   It is easy to see faults in others, and as hard to see them in
   ourselves. Jehu was zealous against Baal and his priests, because that
   was Ahab's sin; but not against the calves of Bethel, because that was
   his own sin. This zeal is the true character of a hypocrite; his own
   garden is overrun with weeds, while he is busy in looking over his
   neighbor's pale.

   Seventhly, There is a sinful zeal: all the former may be called sinful
   from some defect; but this I call sinful in a more special notion,
   because against the life and chief of religion. It is a zeal, against
   zeal, that flies not at profaneness, but at the very power of
   godliness; not at error, but at truth; and is most hot against the most
   spiritual and important truths of the times. Whence else are the
   sufferings of men for the truth, but from the spirit of zeal against
   the truth? This may be called a devilish zeal; for as there is the
   faith of devils, so there is the zeal of devils: "Therefore his rage is
   great, because he knows his time is short."

   Eighthly, there is a scriptureless zeal, that is not butted and bounded
   by the word, but by some base and low end. Such was Saul's zeal, when
   God bids him destroy Amalek, "and spare neither man nor beast;" when
   contrary to God's command, he spares the best of the sheep and oxen,
   under pretence of zeal for God's sacrifice. Another time, when he had
   no such command, then he slew the Gibeonites "in zeal to the children
   of Israel and Judah."

   Many a man's zeal is greater then and there, when and where he hath the
   least warrant from God. The true spirit of zeal is bounded by
   Scripture; for it is for God and the concerns of his glory: God hath no
   glory from that zeal that hath no scripture-warrant.

   Now then, if the zeal of a man in the things of God may be only a blind
   zeal, or a partial zeal, or a misplaced zeal, or a selfish zeal, or an
   outside zeal, or a forensic zeal, or a sinful zeal, or a scriptureless
   zeal; then it is evident, that a man may be very zealous in the matters
   of religion, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   XII. A man may be much in prayer--he may pray often, and pray much; and
   yet be but almost a Christian. So did the Pharisees, whom yet our Lord
   Christ rejects for hypocrites.

   Objection. But is not a praying-frame an argument of a sincere heart?
   Are not the saints of God called "the generation of them that seek the
   face of God?"

   Answer. A man is not therefore a Christian, because he is much in
   prayer. I grant that those prayers that are from the workings and
   sighings of God's Spirit in us; from sincere hearts lifted up to God;
   from a sense of our own emptiness, and God's infinite fulness; that are
   suited to God's will, the great rule of prayer; that are for spiritual
   things, more than temporal; that are accompanied with faith and
   dependence,--such prayers speak a man altogether a Christian. But now a
   man may be much in prayer, and yet be a stranger to such prayer; as,

   1. Nature may put a man upon prayer; for it is a part of natural
   worship. It may put a child of God upon prayer--did Christ: "He went
   and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father! if it be
   possible, let this cup pass from me." This was a prayer of Christ which
   flowed from the sinless strugglings of nature, seeking its own
   preservation.

   2. A man may pray in pretence, for a covering to some sin: so did those
   devout Pharisees: "Wo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
   devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: therefore
   ye shall receive the greater damnation." So the Papists seem very
   devout to pray a rich man's soul out of purgatory; but it is to cheat
   the heir of much of his estate, under pretence of praying for his
   father's soul.

   3. A man may pray, and yet love sin; as Austin before conversion prayed
   against his sin, but was afraid God should hear him, and take him at
   his word. Now, God hears not such prayers: "If I regard iniquity in my
   heart, God will not hear my prayer."

   4. A man may pray much for temporal things, and little for spiritual
   things; and such are the prayers of most men, crying out most for
   temporal things. More for, "Who will show us any good?" than for,
   "Lord, lift upon us the light of thy countenance." David copies out the
   prayer of such: "That our sons may be as plants, and that our daughters
   may be as corner-stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:
   that our garners may be full, &c. Happy is the people that is in such a
   case!" This is the carnal prayer; and this David calls vanity--"They
   are strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity."

   5. A man may pray, and yet be far from God in prayer: "This people draw
   nigh to me with their mouths, and honor me with their lips, but their
   heart is far from me." A man may pray, and yet have no heart in prayer;
   and that God chiefly looks at: "My son, give me thy heart."

   The Jews have this sentence written upon the walls of their synagogues:
   "Prayer, without the intention of the mind, is but a body without a
   soul."

   It is not enough to be conscionable to use prayer, but we must be
   conscionable to the use of prayer. Many are so conscientious that they
   dare not but pray; and yet so irreligious, that they have no heart in
   prayer. A common work of God may make a man conscionable to do duties,
   but nothing less than giving grace in the heart, will make a man
   conscionable in the doing of them.

   6. A man's prayer may be a lie. As a profession without sanctity is a
   lie to the world, so prayer without sincerity, is a lie to God. It is
   said of Israel, that they "sought God, and inquired early after him."
   They were much in prayer, and God calls all but a lie. "Nevertheless,
   they did flatter him with their mouths, and they lied to him with their
   tongues, for their heart was not with him."--"Hearken to my prayer,
   that goeth not out of feigned lips," saith David.

   7. Affliction and the pressure of outward evils, will make a man pray,
   and pray much. "When he slew them, then they sought him, and returned,
   and inquired early after God." The heathen mariners called every man
   upon his God when in a storm: when they fear drowning, then they fall
   to praying, Jonah i. 5. Mariners are for the most part none of the
   devoutest, nor much addicted to prayer. They will swear twice, where
   they pray once; and yet it is said, "They cry to the Lord in their
   trouble:" and hence you have a proverb, "He that cannot pray let him go
   to sea."--"They poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them."

   Now then, if nature may put a man upon prayer; if a man may pray in
   pretence, and design; if a man may pray, and yet love sin; if a man may
   pray mostly for temporal things; if a man may pray, and yet be far from
   God in prayer; if prayer may be a lie, or it may be only the cry of the
   soul under affliction,--sure then a man may be much in prayer, and yet
   be but almost a Christian.

   Objection. But suppose a man pray, and prevail with God in prayer,
   surely that is a witness from heaven of a man's sincerity in prayer:
   now, I pray, and prevail; I ask, and am answered.

   Answer. A man may pray, and be answered; for God many times answers
   prayers in judgment. As God is sometimes silent in mercy, so he speaks
   in wrath; and as he sometimes denies prayer in mercy, so he sometimes
   answers in judgment: when men are over-importunate in something their
   lusts are upon, and will take no nay, then God answers in judgment. "He
   gave them their own desire." They had desired quails, and God sent
   them: but now mark the judgment--"While the meat was in their mouths,
   the wrath of God came upon them, and slew them."

   Objection. But suppose a man's affections are much stirred in
   prayer--how then? Is not that a true note of Christianity? Now my
   affections are much stirred in prayer.

   Answer. So was Esau's, when he sought the blessing. "He sought it
   carefully with tears." A man may be affected with his own parts in a
   duty, while good notions pass through his head, and good words through
   his lips: some good motions also may stir in his heart, but they are
   but sparks which fly out at the tunnel of the chimney, which suddenly
   vanish; so that it is possible a man may pray, and prevail in prayer;
   pray, and be affected in prayer--and yet be but almost a Christian.

   XIII. A man may suffer for Christ in his goods, in his name, in his
   person; and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Every man that bears Christ's cross on his shoulders, doth not,
   therefore, bear Christ's image in his soul.

   Objection. But doth not our Lord Christ make great promises to them
   that suffer, or lose anything for him? Doth he not say, "Every one that
   hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or
   wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an
   hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life?" Sure they are true
   Christians to whom Christ makes this promise!

   Answer. There is a suffering for Christ, that is a note of sincerity,
   and shall have its reward. That is, when a man suffers for a good
   cause, upon a good call, and with a good conscience, for Christ's sake,
   and in Christ's strength; when his sufferings are a filling up "that
   which is behind of the sufferings of Christ;" when a man suffers as a
   Christian, as the apostle hath it, "If a man suffers as a Christian,
   let him not be ashamed;" when a man thrusts not himself into
   sufferings, but stays God's call, such suffering is a proof of
   integrity.

   But now, every suffering for Christ is not suffering as a Christian:
   for,

   1. A man may suffer for Christ, for that profession of religion that is
   upon him; the world hates the show of religion. Times may come, that it
   may cost a man as dear to wear the livery of Christ, as to wear Christ
   himself. Alexander had like to have lost his life for the gospel's
   sake, yet he was that Alexander, as is generally judged, that
   afterwards made shipwreck of faith, and greatly opposed Paul's
   ministry.

   2. A man may suffer for Christ, and yet have no true love to Christ.
   This is supposed: "Though I give my body to be burned, and have not
   charity, it profits nothing."

   Love to Christ is the only noble ground of suffering; but a man may
   suffer much upon other ends.

   1. Out of opinion of meriting by our sufferings, as the Papists; or,

   2. Out of vain glory, or for applause among professors: some have died,
   that their names might live; or,

   3. Out of a Roman resolution, or stoutness of spirit.

   4. Out of a design of profit, as Judas forsook all for Christ, hoping
   to mend his market by closing with him; or,

   5. Rather to maintain an opinion, than for truth's propagation.
   Socrates died for maintaining that there was but one God; but whether
   he died rather for his own opinion, than for God's sake, I think it is
   no hard matter to determine. Thus, a man may suffer for professing
   Christ, and yet suffer upon wrong principles.

   Now then, if a man may suffer for Christ, from the profession that is
   upon him, or suffer for Christ, and yet not truly love him; then a man
   may suffer for Christ, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   XIV. A man may be called of God, and embrace this call, and yet be but
   almost a Christian.

   Judas is a famous instance of this truth: he was called by Christ
   himself, and came at the call of Christ; and yet Judas was but almost a
   Christian.

   Objection. But is not the being under the call of God, a proof of our
   interest in the predestinating love of God? Doth not the apostle say,
   "Whom he predestinated, them he called?" Nay, doth he not say, in the
   next verse, "Whom he called, them he justified?" Nay, doth not God call
   all whom he intends to save?

   Answer. Though God calleth all those that shall be saved, yet all shall
   not be saved whom God calleth. Every man under the gospel is called of
   God in one sense or other, but yet every man under the gospel shall not
   therefore be saved: "For many are called, but few chosen."

   There is a twofold call of God--internal, and external.

   1. There is an internal call of God. Now, this call is a special work
   of the Spirit, by the ministry of the word, whereby a man is brought
   out of a state of nature, into a state of grace; "out of darkness into
   light, from being vessels of wrath, to be made heirs of life." I grant,
   that whoever is under this call of God, is called effectually and
   savingly, to be a Christian indeed. "Every man that hath heard and
   learned of the Father, comes to me."

   2. There is a call of God which a man may have, and yet not be this
   call: there is an external call of God, which is by the ministry of the
   word.

   Now every man that lives under the preaching of the gospel, is thus
   called. God calls every soul of you to repent, and lay a sure
   foundation for heaven and salvation, by the word you hear this day.

   But now every man that is thus called, is not therefore a Christian:
   for,

   1. Many under the call of God, come to Christ, but are not converted to
   Christ, have nothing of the grace and life of Christ; such as he, who,
   when Christ sent out his servants to bid guests unto the marriage, came
   in at the call of Christ, but yet "had not on the wedding garment;"
   that is, had none of the grace and righteousness of Jesus Christ.

   2. Many that are under the call of the gospel, come to Christ, and yet
   afterwards fall away from Christ; as Judas and Demas did. It is said,
   when Christ preached a doctrine that his disciples did not like, that
   "from that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more
   with him."

   Now then, if many are only under this external call of God; if many
   that come to Christ are not converted to Christ, but fall away from
   Christ; then a man may be called of God, and yet be but almost a
   Christian.

   XV. A man may have the spirit of God, and yet be but almost a
   Christian.

   Balaam had the Spirit of God given him when he blessed Israel: "Balaam
   saw Israel abiding in tents, and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him."
   Judas had; for by the Spirit he cast out devils; he was one of them
   that came to Christ, and said, "Lord, even the devils are subject to
   us." Saul had--"Behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit
   of God came upon him, and be prophesied among them."

   Objection. But you will say, "Can a man have the Spirit of God, and yet
   not be a Christian?" Indeed, the Scripture saith, "If any man have not
   the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his;" but surely if any man have
   the Spirit of Christ, he is his!

   Answer. There is a having the Spirit, which is a sure mark of
   saintship. Where the Spirit is an effectual prevailing principle of
   grace and sanctification, renewing and regenerating the heart: where
   the Spirit is a potent worker, "helping the soul's infirmities: where
   the Spirit is so as to "abide forever." But now every man that hath the
   Spirit, hath not the Spirit in this manner: for,

   1. A man may have the Spirit only transiently, not abidingly. The
   Spirit may be in a man, and yet not dwell in a man: the Spirit is
   wherever he dwells, but he does not dwell wherever he is; he is in all,
   but dwells in saints only. The hypocrite may have the Spirit for a
   season, but not to abide in him forever.

   2. A man may have the Spirit, and yet not be born of the Spirit. Every
   true Christian is born of the Spirit. A hypocrite may have the gifts of
   the Spirit, but not the graces: the Spirit may be in him by the way of
   illumination, but not by way of sanctification; by way of conviction,
   but not by way of conversion. Though he may have much common grace for
   the good of others, yet he may have no special grace for the good of
   himself; though his profession be spiritual, yet his state and
   condition may be carnal.

   3. A man may have the Spirit only as a Spirit of bondage. Thus, many
   have the Spirit working only to bondage. "The Spirit of bondage is an
   operation of the Holy Ghost by the law, convincing the conscience of
   sin, and of the curse of the law, and working in the soul such an
   apprehension of the wrath of God, as makes the thoughts of God a terror
   to him."

   This Spirit may be, and often is, without saving grace: this operation
   of the Spirit was in Cain and Judas. There are none that receive the
   Spirit of adoption, but they first receive the Spirit of bondage: yet
   many receive the Spirit of bondage, that never receive the Spirit of
   adoption.

   4. A man may have the Spirit of God working in him, and yet it may be
   resisted by him. It is said of the Jews, "They rebelled, and vexed his
   Holy Spirit:" and the same sin is charged upon their children: "Ye
   stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart, ye have always resisted the
   Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye." The hypocrite retains not
   the Spirit so long as to come up to regeneration and adoption, but
   quenches the motion of it, and thereby miscarries eternally.

   5. A man may have the Spirit, and yet sin that unpardonable sin: he may
   have the Holy Ghost, and yet sin the sin against the Holy Ghost;--nay,
   no man can sin this sin against it, but he that hath some degree of it.

   The true believer hath so much of the Spirit, such a work of it in him,
   that he cannot sin that sin: "He that is born of God, sins not:" to
   wit, that "sin unto death," for that is meant. The carnal professing
   sinner, he cannot sin that sin, because he is carnal and sensual,
   having not the Spirit. A man must have some measure of the Spirit that
   sins this sin: so hath the hypocrite: he is said to be "partaker of the
   Holy Ghost," and he only is capable of sinning the sin against the Holy
   Ghost.

   Now then, if a man may have the Spirit transiently only, not abidingly;
   if a man may have the Spirit, and yet not be born of the Spirit; if he
   may have the Spirit only as a Spirit of bondage; if a man may have the
   Spirit working in him, and yet it may be resisted by him; if a man may
   have the Spirit and yet sin that unpardonable sin against it; then
   surely a man may have the Spirit of God, and yet be but almost a
   Christian.

   XVI. A man may have faith, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   The stony ground, that is, those hearers set out by the stony ground,
   "for a while believed." It is said, that many believed in the name of
   Christ, yet Christ durst not "commit himself to them." Though they
   trusted in Christ, yet Christ would not trust them; and why? "because
   he knew all men." He knew they were rotten at root, notwithstanding
   their faith. A man may have all faith, to the removing of mountains,
   and yet be nothing.

   Objection. But how can this be, that a man may have faith, and yet be
   but almost a Christian? Doth not our Lord Christ promise life eternal
   and salvation to all that believe? Is not this the Gospel that is to be
   preached to every creature, "He that believes shall be saved?"

   Answer. Though it is true what our Lord Christ saith, that "he that
   believes shall be saved," yet it is as true, that many believe that
   shall never be saved; for Simon Magus believed; yea, James saith, "The
   devils believe and tremble:" now none will say these shall be saved. As
   it is true, what the apostle saith, "All men have not faith," so it is
   as true, that there are some men have faith, who are no whit the better
   for their faith.

   You must know therefore there is a two-fold faith,

   1. Special and saving.

   2. Common and not saving.

   1. There is a saving faith.

   This is called "faith of the operation of God." It is a work of God's
   own Spirit in the soul. It is such a faith as rests and casts the soul
   wholly upon Christ for grace and glory, pardon and peace,
   sanctification and salvation. It is a united act of the whole soul,
   understanding, will and affections, all concurring to unite the soul to
   an all-sufficient Redeemer. It is such a faith as "purifies the heart,"
   and makes it clean; it influences and gives strength and life to all
   other graces. Now, whoever hath this faith, is a Christian indeed; this
   is the "faith of God's elect." But then,

   2. There is a common faith, not saving, a fading and temporary faith;
   there is the faith of Simon Magus, as well as the faith of Simon Peter:
   Simon Magus believed, and yet he was in the "gall of bitterness, and in
   the bond of iniquity." Now Simon Magus had more followers than Simon
   Peter: the faith of most men will at last be found to be no better than
   the faith of Simon Magus: for,

   First, The faith of most is but a temporary faith, endures for a while,
   and then dies and perisheth; true and saving faith, such as is the
   faith of God's elect, cannot die: it may fail in the act, but not in
   the habit; the sap may not be in the branch, but it is always in the
   root.

   That faith that perisheth, that faith a man may have and perish.

   Secondly, there is a faith that lies only in generals, not in
   particulars: as there is a general and particular object of faith, so
   there is a general and particular faith. The general object of faith is
   the whole Scripture; the particular object of faith is Christ in the
   promise. Now many have a general faith to believe all the Scripture,
   and yet have no faith to make particular application of Jesus Christ in
   the promise. Devils and reprobates may believe the truth of the
   Scripture, and what is written of the dying and suffering of Christ for
   sinners; but there are but few that can close up themselves in the
   wounds of Christ, and by his stripes fetch in healing to their own
   souls.

   Thirdly, There is a faith that is seated in the understanding, but not
   in the will; this is a very common faith: many assent to the truth.
   They believe all the attributes of God, that he is just, holy, wise,
   faithful, good, merciful, &c. But yet they rest not on him
   notwithstanding. They believe the commands are true, but yet do not
   obey them: they believe the promises are true, but yet do not embrace
   and apply them: they believe the threatenings are true, but yet do not
   flee from them.

   Thus their faith lies in assent, but not consent; they have faith to
   confess a judgment, but none to take out execution: by assent they lay
   a foundation, but never build upon it by application. They believe that
   Christ died to save them that believe, and yet they believe not in
   Christ, that they may be saved.

   O my brethren, it is not a believing head, but a believing heart that
   makes a Christian; "with the heart man believes to righteousness:"
   without this our "faith is vain, we are yet in our sins."

   Fourthly, There is a faith without experience; many believe the word
   upon hearsay, to be the word of God; but they never felt the power and
   virtue of it upon their hearts and consciences. Now what good is it to
   believe the truth of the word, if a man's conscience never felt the
   power of the word:' what is it to believe the truth of the promise, if
   we never tasted the sweetness of the promise? We are in this case like
   a man that believes the description others make of strange countries,
   but never travelled them to know the truth: or as a patient that
   believes all the physician says, but yet tries none of his potions. We
   believe the word, because we cannot gainsay it; but yet we have no
   experience of any saving good wrought by the word, and so are but
   almost Christians.

   Fifthly, There is a faith that is without brokenness of heart, that
   does not avail to melt or soften the heart, and therefore is not true
   faith; for the least true faith is ever joined with a bending will, and
   broken heart.

   Sixthly, There is a faith that transforms not the heart; faith without
   fruit, that doth not bring forth the new creature in the soul, but
   leaves it in a state of sin and death. This is a faith that makes a man
   a sound professor, but not a sound believer; he believes the truth, but
   not as it is in Jesus; for then it would change and transform him into
   the likeness of Jesus. He believes that a man must be changed that
   would be saved, but yet is not savingly changed by believing. Thus,
   while others believe to salvation, he believes to damnation: for "his
   web shall not become a garment; neither shall he cover himself with his
   work."

   Now then, if a man's faith may be but temporary, or may lie only in
   generals, or may be seated in the understanding only, or may be without
   experience, or may be without a broken heart, or without a new heart;
   surely then a man may have faith, he may taste of this "heavenly gift,"
   and yet be but almost a Christian.

   XVII. A man may go further yet: he may possibly have a love to the
   people of God, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Every kind of love to those who are saints, is not a proof of our
   saintship. Pharaoh loved Joseph, and advanced him to the second place
   in the kingdom, and yet Pharaoh was but a wicked man: Ahab loved
   Jehoshaphat and made a league with him, and married his daughter
   Athaliah to Jehoram, Jehoshaphat's son, and yet Ahab was a wicked
   wretch.

   But you will say this seems to contradict the testimony of the
   Scriptures; for that makes love to the saints and people of God, a sure
   proof of our regeneration, and interest in life eternal: "We know that
   we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren." Nay,
   the Spirit of God putteth this as a characteristical distinction
   between saints and sinners: "In this the children of God are manifest,
   and the children of the devil: whosoever doth not righteousness, is not
   of God, neither he that loveth not his brother." By brethren we do not
   understand brethren by place, those who are of the same country or
   nation, such as are called brethren in Rom. ix. 3, Acts vii. 23, 25.
   Nor do we understand brethren by race, those who are descended of the
   same parents such are called brethren in James i. 2. But by brethren we
   understand brethren by grace, and supernatural regeneration, such as
   are the children of God; and these are the brethren whom to love is a
   sure sign that we are the children of God.

   Answer. To this I answer, that there is a love to the children of God,
   which is a proof of our being the children of God. As for instance,
   when we love them as such, for that very reason, as being the saints of
   God, when we love them for the image of God, which appeareth in them,
   because of that grace and holiness which shineth forth in their
   conversations; this is truly commendable, to love the godly for
   godliness sake, the saints for saintship sake, this is a sure testimony
   of our Christianity. The love of grace in another, is a good proof of
   the life of grace in ourselves. There can be no better evidence of the
   Spirit of Christ in us, than to love the image of Christ in others. For
   this is a certain truth that a sinner cannot love a saint as such; "an
   Israelite is an abomination to an Egyptian."

   There is a contrariety and natural enmity between the two seeds;
   between the children of the world, and those whom the Father in His
   eternal love hath "chosen out of the world."

   It is likeness which is the great ground of love.Now there is the
   highest dissimilitude and unlikeness between an unregenerate sinner,
   and a child of God, and therefore a child of God cannot love a sinner
   as a sinner: "In whose eyes a vile person is contemned." He may love
   him as a creature; he may love his soul, or he may love him under some
   relation that he stands in to him. Thus God loves the damned spirits,
   as they are his creatures, but as fallen angels he hateth them with an
   infinite hatred. So to love a sinner, as a sinner, this a child of God
   cannot do; so neither can a sinner love a child of God as a child of
   God. That he may love a child of God, that I grant, but it is upon some
   other consideration; he may love a person that is holy, not the person
   for his holiness, but for some other respect. As,

   1. A man may love a child of God for his loving, peaceable, courteous
   deportment to all with whom he converseth. Religion beautifies the
   conversation of a man, and sets him off to the eye of the world. The
   grace of God is no friend to morose, churlish, unmannerly behavior
   among men; it promotes an affable demeanor and sweetness to all; and
   where this is found, it winneth respect and love from all.

   2. A man may love a saint for his outward greatness and splendor in the
   world; men are very apt to honor worldly greatness, and therefore the
   rich saint shall be loved and honored, whilst the poor saint is hated
   and despised. This is as if a man should value the goodness of his
   sword by the embroidery of his belt; or his horse for the beauty of his
   trappings, rather than for his strength and swiftness.

   True love to the children of God, reaches to all the children of God,
   poor as well as rich, bond as well as free, ignoble as well as noble,
   for the image of Christ is alike amiable and lovely in all.

   3. A man may love a child of God for his fidelity and usefulness in his
   place: where religion in the power of it taketh hold of a man's heart,
   it makes him true to all his trusts, diligent in his business, faithful
   in all his relations; and this obligeth respect. A carnal master may
   prize a godly apprentice or servant that makes conscience of pleasing
   his master, and is diligent in promoting his interest.

   I might instance in many things of the like nature, as charity, beauty,
   wit, learning, parts, &c., which may procure love to the people of God
   from the men of the world. But this love is no proof of charity: For,

   First, It is but a natural love arising from some carnal respect, or
   self-ends: that love which is made by the Scripture an evidence of our
   regeneration, is a spiritual love, the principal loadstone and
   attraction whereof is grace and holiness; it is a love which embraceth
   a "righteous man in the name of a righteous man."

   2. A carnal man's love to saints, is a limited and bounded love; it is
   not universal "to the seed." Now as in sin, he that doth not make
   conscience of every sin, maketh conscience of no sin as sin; so he who
   doth not love all in whom the image of Christ is found, loveth none for
   that of the image of Christ which is found in them.

   Now then, if the love we bear to the people of God may possibly arise
   from natural love only, or from some carnal respect; or if it be a
   limited love, not extended to all the people of God, then it is
   possible that a man may love the people of God, and yet be no better
   than almost a Christian.

   XVIII. A man may obey the commands of God, yea, many of the commands of
   God, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Balaam seems very conscientious of steering his course by the compass
   of God's command. When Balak sent to him to come and curse the people
   of God, saith Balaam, "If Balak would give me his house full of silver
   and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God:" and so saith
   he, "The word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak." The
   young man went far in obedience, "All these have I observed from my
   youth up;" and yet he was but a hypocrite, for he forsook Christ after
   all.

   Objection. But is it not said, "He that hath my commandments, and
   keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be
   loved of my Father; and I will love him, and manifest myself unto him?"
   And doth not our Lord Christ tell us expressly, "Ye are my friends, if
   ye do whatever I command you?" And can a man be a friend of Christ and
   be but almost a Christian?

   I answer--There is an obedience to the commands of Christ, which is a
   sure proof of our Christianity and friendship to Christ.

   This obedience hath a threefold property.

   It is, 1. Evangelical. 2. Universal. 3. Continual.

   First, It is evangelical obedience, and that both in matter and manner,
   ground and end.

   In the matter of it; and that is what God requires: "Ye are my friends,
   if ye do whatever I command you."

   In the manner of it; and that is according as God requires: "God is a
   Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in
   truth."

   In the ground of it; and that is, "a pure heart, a good conscience, and
   a faith unfeigned."

   In the end of it; and that is, the honor and glory of God: "Whatever ye
   do, do all to the glory of God."

   Secondly, It is a universal obedience, which extendeth itself to all
   the commands of God alike: it respects the duties of both tables. Such
   was the obedience of Caleb, "who followed the Lord fully;" and of
   David, who had "respect to all his commands."

   Thirdly, It is a continual obedience, a putting the hand to God's
   plough, without looking back: "I have inclined my heart to perform thy
   statutes always, even to the end."

   He that thus obeys the command of God, is a Christian indeed; a friend
   of Christ indeed. But all obedience to the commands of God, is not this
   obedience; For,

   1. There is a partial obedience--a piece-meal religion, when a man
   obeys God in one command, and not in another; owns him in one duty, and
   not in another; when a man seems to make conscience of the duties of
   one table, and not of the duties of another. This is the religion of
   most.

   Now this obedience is no obedience; for as he that doth not love God
   above all, doth not love God at all; so he that doth not obey all the
   commands universally, cannot be said to obey any command truly. It is
   said of those in Samaria that they "feared the Lord, and served their
   own gods after their own manner." And yet in the very next verse it is
   said, "They feared not the Lord;" so that their fear of the Lord was no
   fear. In like manner, that obedience to God is no obedience, which is
   but a partial and piecemeal obedience.

   2. A man may obey much, and yet be in his old nature; and if so, then
   all his obedience in that estate is but a painted sin: "He that
   offereth an oblation, is as if he offered swine's blood; and he that
   burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol." The nature must be renewed,
   before the command can be rightly obeyed; for "a corrupt tree cannot
   bring forth good fruit." Whatever a man's performances are, they cannot
   be called obedience, whilst the heart remaineth unregenerate, because
   the principle is false and unsound. Every duty done by a believer, is
   accepted of God, as part of his obedience to the will of God, though it
   be done in much weakness; because, though the believer's hand is weak,
   yet "his heart is right." The hypocrite may have the most active hand,
   but the believer hath the most faithful and sincere heart.

   3. A man may obey the law, and yet have no love to the Lawgiver. A
   carnal heart may do the command of God, but he cannot love God, and
   therefore cannot do it aright; for love to God is the foundation and
   spring of all true obedience. Every command of God is to be done in
   love: this is the "fulfilling of the law." The apostle saith, "Though I
   bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be
   burned, (these seem to be acts of the highest obedience), yet if I have
   not love, it profits me nothing."

   4. I might add, that a man may be much in obedience from sinister and
   base selfish ends: as the Pharisees prayed much, gave much alms, fasted
   much but our Lord Christ tells us, that it was "that they might be seen
   of men, and have glory of men." Most of the hypocrite's piety empties
   itself into vain-glory; and therefore he is but an empty vine in all he
   does, because "he bringeth forth fruit to himself." It is the end that
   justifies the action: indeed, a good end cannot make a bad action good,
   but yet the want of a good end makes a good action bad.

   Now then, if a man may obey the commands of God partially, and by
   halves; if he may do it, and yet be in his natural state; if he may
   obey the commands of God, and yet not love God; if the ends of his
   obedience may be sinful and unwarrantable,--then a man may be much in
   obeying the commands of God, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   XIX. A man may be sanctified, and yet be but almost a Christian.

   Every kind of sanctification doth not make a man a new creature; for
   many are sanctified that are never renewed. You read of them that
   "count the blood of the covenant, wherewith they were sanctified, an
   unholy thing."

   Objection. But doth not the Scripture tell us, that "both he who
   sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified; are all one: for which cause,
   he is not ashamed to call them brethren." And can a man be one with
   Christ, and yet be but almost a Christian?

   Answer. To this I answer--You must know there is a twofold work of
   sanctification spoken of in Scripture.

   The one, common and ineffectual.

   The other, special and effectual.

   That work of sanctification which is true and effectual, is the working
   of the Spirit of God in the soul, enabling it to the mortifying of all
   sin, to the obeying of every command, to "walking with God in all
   well-pleasing." Now, whoever is thus sanctified, is one with him that
   sanctifieth. Christ will not be ashamed to call such brethren; for they
   are "flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone."

   But then there is a more common work of sanctification which is
   ineffectual as to the two great works of dying to sin, and living to
   God. This kind of sanctification may help to restrain sin, but not to
   mortify sin; it may lop off the boughs, but it layeth not the axe to
   the root of the tree; it sweeps and garnishes the room with common
   virtues, but doth not adorn it with saving graces; so that a man is but
   almost a Christian, notwithstanding this sanctification.

   Or thus, there is an inward and outward sanctification.

   Inward sanctification is that which deals with the soul and its
   faculties, understanding, conscience, will, memory, and affections.
   Outward sanctification is that which deals with the life and
   conversation. Both these must concur to make a man a Christian indeed:
   therefore the apostle puts them together in his prayer for the
   Thessalonians: "The God of peace sanctify you wholly; and, I pray God,
   your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved blameless unto the
   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." A man is then sanctified wholly when
   he is sanctified both inwardly and outwardly--both in heart and
   affections, and in life and conversation. Outward sanctification is not
   enough without inward, nor inward without outward: we must have both
   "clean hands, and a pure heart." The heart must be pure, that we may
   not incur blame from within; and the hands must be clean, that we may
   not incur shame from without. We must have hearts "sprinkled from an
   evil conscience, and bodies washed with pure water." "We must cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit." Inward purity is
   the most excellent, but, without the outward, it is not sufficient; the
   true Christian is made up of both.

   Now many have clean hands, but unclean hearts. They wash the outside of
   the cup and platter, when all is filthy within. Now, the former without
   the latter, profiteth a man no more than it profited Pilate, who
   condemned Christ, to wash his hands in the presence of the people: he
   washed his hands of the blood of Christ, and yet had a hand in the
   death of Christ. The Egyptian temples were beautiful on the outside,
   but within you shall find nothing but some serpent or crocodile. "He is
   not a Jew which is one outwardly." Judas was a saint without, but a
   sinner within; openly a disciple, but secretly, a devil.

   Some pretend to inward sanctity without outward. This is the pretence
   of the open sinner: "Though I sometimes drop an idle, foolish word,"
   saith he, "or though I sometimes swear an oath, yet I think no hurt:--I
   thank God my heart is as good as the best!" Such are like the sinner
   Moses mentions; that "blessed himself in his heart, saying, I shall
   have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine own heart, to add
   drunkenness to thirst."

   Some pretend to outward sanctity without inward. Such are like the
   Scribes and Pharisees, "who outwardly appear righteous unto men, but
   within are full of hypocrisy and iniquity;" fair professors, but foul
   sinners.

   Inward sanctity without outward, is impossible; for it will not reform
   the life. Outward sanctity without inward, is unprofitable; for it will
   not reform the heart: a man is not a true Christian without both. The
   body doth not make a man without the soul, nor the soul without the
   body; both are essential to the being of man: so the sanctification of
   both, are essential to the being of the new man. True sanctification
   begins at the heart, but works out into the life and conversation; and
   if so, then man may attain to an outward sanctification, and yet, for
   want of an inward, be no better than almost a Christian.

   And so I shall end this long pursuit of the almost Christian, in his
   progress heavenward, with this one general conclusion:--

   XX. A man may do all, as to external duties and worship, that a true
   Christian can; and, when he hath done all, be but almost a Christian.

   You must know, all the commands of God have an intra and an extra:
   there is, as I may say, the body and the soul of the command. And
   accordingly, there is an internal and an external worship of God.

   Now the internal acts of worshipping of God" are to love God, to fear
   God, to delight in God, to trust in God, &c.

   The external acts of worshipping of God, are by praying, teaching,
   hearing, &c.

   Now there is a vast difference between these internal and external acts
   of worship; and such a difference there is, that they distinguish the
   altogether from the almost Christian; the sincere believer from the
   unsound professor: and, indeed, in this very thing the main difference
   between them doth lie.

   1. Internal acts of worship are good propter fieri; the goodness doth
   adhere intrinsically to the thing done. A man cannot love God, nor fear
   God, but it will be imputed to him for a gracious act, and a great part
   of his holiness. But now, external acts of worship are not denominated
   good, so much from the matter done, propter fieri, as from the manner
   of doing them. A man cannot sin in loving and delighting in God, but he
   may sin in praying and hearing, &c., for want of a due manner.

   2. Internal. acts of worship put a goodness into external: it is our
   faith, our love, our fear of God, that makes our duties good.

   3. They better the heart, and greater the degrees of a man's holiness.
   External duties do not always do this. A man may pray, and yet his
   heart never the holier; he may hear the word, and yet his heart never
   the softer: but now, the more a man fears God, the wiser he is: the
   more a man loves God, the holier he is. Love is the perfection of
   holiness: we shall never be perfect in holiness, until we come to be
   perfect in love.

   4. There is such an excellency in this internal worship, that he who
   mixes it with his external duties, is a true Christian when he doth
   least but without this mixture, he is but almost a Christian that doth
   most.

   Internal acts of worship, joined with outward, sanctify them, and make
   them accepted of God, though few: external acts of worship, without
   inward, make them abhorred of God, though they be never so many. So
   that, although the almost Christian may do all those duties in
   hypocrisy, which a true Christian doth in sincerity; nay, though in
   doing external duties, he may out-do the true Christian, as the comet
   makes a greater blaze than the true star: if Elijah fast and mourn,
   Baal's priests will cut their flesh; yet he cannot do those internal
   duties, that the meanest true Christian can.

   The almost Christian can pray, but he cannot love God; he can teach or
   hear, &c., but he cannot take delight in God. Mark Job's query
   concerning the hypocrite: "Will he delight himself in the Almighty?" He
   will pray to the Almighty, but will he delight himself in the Almighty?
   Will he take pleasure in God? Ah, no! he will not--he cannot! Delight
   in God ariseth from a suitableness between the faculty, and the object;
   now, none more unsuitable, than God and a carnal heart. Delight arises
   from the having what we desire, and from enjoying what we have. How
   then can he delight in God, that neither enjoyeth, nor hath, nor truly
   desireth God? Delight in God is one of the highest exercises of grace:
   and therefore, how can he delight in God, that hath no grace?

   Why, then, should any saint of God be discouraged, when he hears how
   far the almost Christian may go in the way to heaven: whereas, he that
   is the weakest true believer, that hath the least true grace, goes
   farther than he; for he believes in, and loves God.

   Should the almost Christian do less, as to matter of external duties,
   yet, if he had but the least true faith, the least sincerity of love to
   Christ, he would surely be saved; and should the true Christian do ten
   times more duties than he doth, yet, had he not faith in Christ, and
   love to Christ, he would surely be rejected.

   O, therefore, let not any weak believer be discouraged, though
   hypocrites may out-do them, and go beyond them in duty; for all their
   duties are done in hypocrisy, but your faith and love to God in duties,
   is a proof of your sincerity.

   I. I do not speak this to discourage any soul in the doing of duties,
   or to beat down outward performances, but to rectify the soul in the
   doing of them. As the apostle saith, "Covet earnestly the best gifts:
   but yet I show you a more excellent way." So I say, covet the best
   gifts; covet much to be in duties, much in prayer, much in hearing, &c.
   "But I will show you a more excellent way;" and that is, the way of
   faith and love. Pray much, but then believe much too. Hear much; read
   much; but then love God much too. Delight in the word and ordinances of
   God much, but then delight in the God of ordinances more.

   And when you are most in duties, as to your use of them, O then be sure
   to be above duties, as to your resting and dependence upon them. Would
   you be Christians, indeed,--altogether Christians? O then, be much in
   the use and exercise of ordinances, but be much more in faith and
   dependence upon Christ and his righteousness. When your obedience is
   most to the command, then let your faith be most upon the promise. The
   professor rests in duties, and so is but almost a Christian but you
   must be sure to rest upon the Lord Christ. This is the way to be
   altogether Christians; for, if ye believe, then are ye Abraham's seed,
   and heirs according to the promise. And thus I have answered the first
   query; to wit, how far a man may go in the way to heaven, and yet be
   but almost a Christian.

   1. He may have much knowledge.

   2. He may have great gifts.

   3. He may have a high profession.

   4. He may do much against sin.

   5. He may desire grace.

   6. He may tremble at the word.

   7. He may delight in the word.

   8. He may be a member of the church of Christ.

   9. He may have great hopes of heaven.

   10. He may be under great and visible changes.

   11. He may be very zealous in the matters of religion.

   12. He may be much in prayer.

   13. He may suffer for Christ.

   14. He may be called of God.

   15. He may, in some sense, have the Spirit if God.

   16. He may have some kind of faith.

   17. He may love the people of God.

   18. He may go far in obeying the commands of God.

   19. He may be, in some sense, sanctified.

   20. He may do all, as to external duties, that a true Christian can,
   and yet be no better than almost a Christian.
     __________________________________________________________________

  QUESTION II.

   Why, or whence is it, that many men go so far, as that they come to be
   almost Christians?

   First, It may be to answer the call of conscience. Though few men have
   grace, yet all men have conscience. Now do but observe, and you shall
   see how far conscience may go in this work.

   1. Conscience owns a God, and that this God must be worshipped and
   served by the creature Atheists in practice, we have many; such as the
   apostle speaks of: "They profess to know God, but in works they deny
   him." But atheists in judgment none can be. Tully, a heathen, could
   say, "Nulla gens tam barbara," &c. Now there being such a light in
   conscience, as to discover that there is a God, and that he must be
   worshipped by the help of farther light--the light of the word, a man
   may be enabled to do much in the ways of God, and yet his heart without
   a dram of grace.

   2. Know this, that natural conscience is capable of great improvements
   from the means of grace. Sitting under the ordinances may exceedingly
   heighten the endowments of conscience. It may be much regulated, though
   it be not at all renewed: it may be enlightened, convinced, and yet
   never savingly converted and changed. You read in Hebrews vi. 4, of
   some that were "once enlightened, and tasted of the heavenly gift, and
   were made partakers of the Holy Ghost." What work shall we call this?
   It could not be a saving work, a true change and conversion of state;
   for, notwithstanding this enlightening, and tasting, and partaking, yet
   they are here said to fall away, verse 6. Had it been a true work of
   grace, they could never have fallen away from that. A believer may
   fall, but he cannot fall away; he may fall foully, but he cannot fall
   finally; for, "underneath are the everlasting arms." His faith is
   established in the strength of that prayer of Christ that our faith
   fail not. Nay, he tells us expressly, that it is eternal life which he
   gives, from which we shall never perish.

   This work, then, here spoken of, cannot be any saving work, because it
   is not an abiding work; for they that are under it, are said to fall
   away from it. But though it be not a saving grace, yet it is a
   supernatural work. It is an improvement made by the word upon the
   consciences of men, through the power of the Spirit; and therefore they
   are said to "taste the good word of God," and to be made "partakers of
   the Holy Ghost." They have not the Spirit abiding in them savingly, but
   striving with them, and working upon them convincingly, to the
   awakening and setting conscience on work. And conscience, thus stirred,
   may carry a man very far in religion, and in the duties of the gospel,
   and yet be but a natural conscience.

   A common work of the Spirit, may stead a man very much in the duties of
   religion, though it must be a special work of the Spirit that steads a
   man to salvation. A man may have the assisting presence of the Spirit,
   enabling him to preach and pray, and yet he may perish for want of the
   renewing presence of the Spirit, enabling him to believe. Judas had the
   former, and yet perished for want of the latter. He had the Spirit
   assisting him to cast out devils; but yet he had not the Spirit
   renewing him; for he was cast out himself. Thus a man may have an
   improved conscience, and yet be a stranger to a renewed conscience; and
   conscience, thus improved, may put a man very much upon duty. I pray
   God, none of us mistake a conscience, thus improved by the word, for a
   conscience renewed by the Spirit. The mistake is very easy, especially
   when a life of duties is the fruit of it.

   3. The conscience of a natural man is subject to distress and trouble.
   Though a natural conscience is not sanctified with grace, yet it is
   often troubled at sin. Trouble of conscience is not incident to
   believers only, but sometimes to unbelievers also. A believer's
   conscience is sometimes troubled, when his sin is truly pardoned: and a
   natural man's conscience is troubled for sin though it is never freed
   from sin. God sometimes sets the word home upon the sinner's
   conscience, and applies the terrors of the law to it; and this fills
   the soul with fear and horror of death and hell. Now, in this case, the
   soul usually betakes itself to a life of duties, merely to fence
   trouble out of conscience.

   When Absalom sets on fire Joab's cornfields, then he runs to him,
   though he refused before: so when God lets a spark of hell, as it were,
   fall upon the sinner's conscience in applying the terrors of the word,
   this drives the sinner to a life of duties which he never minded
   before. The ground of many a man's engaging in religion, is the trouble
   of his conscience; and the end of his continuing in religion, is the
   quieting of conscience. If conscience would never check him, God should
   never hear from him.

   Natural conscience hath a voice, and speaks aloud many times in the
   sinner's ears, and telleth him, This ought not to be done: God must not
   be forgotten: the commands of God ought not to be slighted; living in
   sin will be the ruin of the soul. And hence it is that a natural man
   runs to duties, and takes up a lifeless and graceless profession, that
   he may thereby silence conscience. As a man sick in his stomach,
   whatever sweet morsel he hath eaten, he brings up all; and although it
   was sweet in the eating, yet it is bitter in the rising; so it fareth
   with the sinner, when he is sermon-sick, or conscience-sick. Though his
   sin was sweet in the practice, yet the thought of it riseth bitter upon
   the conscience: and then his profession of religion is the pill he
   rolleth about in his mouth, to take away the bitterness of sin's taste.

   4. Natural conscience, enlightened by the word, may discover to a man
   much of the misery of a natural state; though not effectually to bring
   him out of it; yet so as to make him restless and. weary in it. It may
   show a sinner his nakedness; and hereupon the soul runneth to a life of
   duties; thinking hereby to stead the misery of his case, and to make a
   covering for his nakedness. It is said, "that when Adam and Eve saw
   they were naked, they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves a
   covering." So when once the sinner seeth his nakedness and vileness by
   reason of sin, whereas he should run to Christ, and close with him, and
   beg his righteousness for a covering, "that the shame of his nakedness
   doth not appear;" he rather runneth to a life of duties and
   performances, and thus maketh himself a covering with the fig-leaves of
   a profession, without Christ truly embraced, and conscience at all
   renewed. Natural roan would fain be his own Saviour; and supposeth a
   change of state to be a thing within his own power; and that the true
   work of grace lieth in leaving off the practice of sin, and taking up a
   life of duties: and, therefore, upon this principle, doth many a
   graceless professor outstrip a sound believer; for he resteth on his
   own performances, and hopeth these will commend him to God.

   Question. If a natural conscience may go thus far, then what difference
   is there between this natural conscience in hypocrites and sinners, and
   a renewed conscience in believers? or, how may I know whether the
   working of my conscience be the working of nature only, or else of
   grace wrought in it?

   Answer. I grant that it is difficult to distinguish between the one and
   the other; and the difficulty hath a twofold rise.

   1. It ariseth from that hypocrisy that is in the best saints. The
   weakest believer is no hypocrite, but yet there is some hypocrisy in
   the strongest believer. Where there is most grace, there is some sin;
   and where there is most sincerity, yet there is some hypocrisy.

   Now it is very incident to a tender conscience to misgive and mistrust
   its state, upon the sight of any sin. When he sees hypocrisy break out
   in any duty or performance, then he complains, "Surely my aims are not
   sincere! my conscience is not renewed! it is but natural conscience
   enlightened, not by grace purged and changed." [3]

   2. It ariseth from that resemblance there is between grace and
   hypocrisy; for hypocrisy is a resemblance of grace, without substance;
   the likeness of grace, without the life of grace. There is no grace but
   a hypocrite may have somewhat like it; and there is no duty done by a
   Christian, but a hypocrite may outstrip him in it. Now, when one that
   hath not true grace shall go further than one that hath, this may well
   make the believer question whether his grace be true or not; or whether
   the workings of his conscience be not the workings of nature only,
   rather than of grace wrought in it.

   But to answer the question--You may make a judgment of this in these
   seven particulars:--

   1. If a natural man's conscience putteth him upon duty, be doth usually
   bound himself in the work of God. His duties are limited; his obedience
   is a limited obedience. He doth one duty, and neglecteth another. He
   picketh and chooseth among the commands of God; obeyeth one, and
   slighteth another. Thus much is enough; what need any more? If I do
   thus and thus, I shall go to heaven at last. But now, where conscience
   is renewed by grace, there it is otherwise. Though there may be many
   weaknesses which accompany its duties, yet that soul never bounds
   itself in working after God: it never loves God. so much, but still it
   would love him more; nor seeks him so much, but still it would seek him
   more; nor doth it serve God so well at any time, but it still makes
   conscience of serving him better. A renewed conscience is a spring of
   universal obedience: for it seeth an infinite excellency, and goodness,
   and holiness in God; and. therefore would fain have its service rise up
   towards some proportionableness to the object. A God of infinite
   excellency and goodness, should have infinite love, saith conscience: a
   holy God should have service from a holy heart, saith conscience.

   Now then, if I set bounds to my love to God, or to my service to God;
   if I limit myself in my obedience to the holy God; love one command,
   and slight another; obey in one point, and yet lie cross in another;
   then is all I do but the workings of a natural conscience. But on the
   other hand, if I love the Lord with my whole heart, and whole soul, and
   serve him with all my might and strength; if "I esteem all God's
   precepts concerning all things to be right, and have respect to all his
   commands," then is my love and service from a renewed conscience.

   2. If a natural man's conscience check or accuse for sin, then he
   seeketh to stop the mouth of it, but not to satisfy it. Most of the
   natural man's duties are to still and stifle conscience.

   But now, the believer chooseth rather to let conscience cry, than to
   stop the mouth of it, until he can do it upon good terms, and till he
   can fetch in satisfaction to it from the blood of Jesus Christ, by
   fresh acts of faith apprehended and applied. The natural man seeketh to
   still the noise of conscience, rather than to remove the guilt. The
   believer seeketh the removal of guilt by the application of Christ's
   blood; and then conscience is quiet of itself. As a foolish man, having
   a mote fallen into his eye, and making it water, he wipeth away the
   water, and labors to keep it dry, but never searcheth his eye to get
   oat the mote; but a wise man mindeth not so much the wiping, as the
   searching his eye; somewhat is got in, and that causeth the watering,
   and therefore the cause must be. removed. Now then, if when conscience
   accuseth for sin, I take up a life of duties, a form of godliness, to
   stop the mouth of conscience; and if hereupon conscience be still and
   quiet; then is this but a natural conscience: but if, when conscience
   checks, it will not be satisfied with anything but the blood of Christ,
   and therefore I use duties to bring me to Christ; and if I beg the
   sprinkling of his blood upon conscience, and labor not so much to stop
   the mouth of it, as to remove guilt from it; then is this a renewed
   conscience.

   3. There is no natural man, let him go never so far, let him do never
   so much in the matters of religion, but still he has his Delilah, his
   bosom-lust. Judas went far, but he carried his covetousness along with
   him. Herod went far; he did many things under the force of John's
   ministry; but yet there was one thing he did not; he did not put away
   his brother's wife--his Herodias lay in his bosom still. Nay, commonly,
   all the natural man's duties are to hide some sin; his profession is
   only made use of for a cover-shame. But now the renewed conscience
   hateth all sin, as David did: "I hate every false way;". he regardeth
   no iniquity in his heart: he useth duties, not to cover sin, but to
   help work down, and work out sin. Now then, if I profess religion; if I
   make mention of the name of the Lord, and make my "boast of the law,
   and yet through breaking the law dishonor God;" if I live. in the love
   of any sin, and make use of my profession to cover it, then am I a
   hypocrite, and my duties flow but from a natural conscience: but, on
   the other hand, if I "name the name of the Lord Jesus, and withal
   depart from iniquity;" if I use duties, not to cover, but to discover
   and mortify sin; then am I upright before God, and my duties flow from
   a renewed conscience.

   4. A natural man prides himself in his duties. If he be much in duty,
   then he is much lifted up under duty. So did the Pharisee: "God, I
   thank thee that I am not as other men are;" and why? where lay the
   difference? why, "I fast twice in the week: I give tithes of all," &c.

   But now take a gracious heart, a renewed conscience, and when his
   duties are at highest, then is his heart at lowest. Thus it was with
   the apostle Paul; he was much in service, "in season, and out of
   season;" preaching up the Lord Jesus with all boldness and earnestness,
   and yet very humble, in a sense of his own unworthiness, under all: "I
   am not worthy to be called an apostle. To me, who am less than the
   least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among
   the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ." And again, "Of
   sinners, I am chief." Thus a believer, when he is highest in duties,
   then is he lowest in Humility. Duty puffeth up the hypocrite, but a
   believer comes away humbled; and why? because the hypocrite hath had no
   visions of God: he hath seen only his own gifts and parts, and this
   exalteth him: but the believer hath seen God, and enjoyed communion
   with God, and this humbleth him. Communion with God, though it be very
   refreshing, yet it is also very abasing and humbling to the creature.
   Hierome observeth on Zeph. i. 1, where it is said, that "Cushi was the
   son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah;" that "Amariah signifieth, the
   Word of the Lord;' Gedaliah signifieth the Greatness of the Lord;' and
   Cushi is interpreted Humility,' or, my Ethiopian.'" "So that," saith
   he, "from the Word of the Lord cometh a sight of greatness of the Lord;
   and from a sight of the greatness of the Lord, cometh humility."

   Now then, if I pride myself in any duty, and am puffed up under my
   performances; then have I not seen nor met with God in any duty. But on
   the other hand, if when my gifts are at highest, my heart is at lowest;
   if when my spirit is most raised, my heart is the most humbled; if, in
   the midst of all my services, I can maintain a sense of my own
   unworthiness; if Cushi be the son of Gedaliah, then have I seen and had
   communion with God in duty, and my performances are from a renewed
   conscience.

   5. Look what that is to which the heart doth secretly render the glory
   of a duty, and that is the principle of the duty. In Hab. i. 16, we
   read of them that sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their
   drag." Where the glory of an action is rendered to a man's self, the
   principle of that action is self. All rivers run into the sea; that is
   an argument they came from the sea: so when all a man's duties
   terminate in self, then is self the principle of all. Now all the
   natural man's duties run into himself. He was never, by a thorough work
   of grace, truly cast out of himself, and brought to deny himself; and
   therefore he can rise no higher than himself in all he does. He was
   never brought to be poor in spirit, and so to live upon another; to be
   carried out of all duties to Jesus Christ. But the believer giveth the
   glory of all his services to God; whatever strength or life there is in
   duty, God hath all the glory; for he is by grace outed of himself, and
   therefore seeth no excellence or worthiness in self.

   "I labored more abundantly than they all," saith the apostle; but to
   whom doth he ascribe the glory of this? to self? No: "Yet not I," saith
   he, "but the grace of God which was with me." Whenever the grace of
   Christ is wrought in the heart as a principle of duty, you shall find
   the soul when it is most carried out, with a Yet not I, in the mouth of
   it. "I live, yet not I; I labored more abundantly than all, yet not I."
   Self is disclaimed, and Christ most advanced, when it is from grace
   that the heart is quickened: the twenty-four elders cast their crowns
   at Christ's feet.

   There are two things very hard: one is, to take the shame of our sins
   to ourselves; the other is, to give the glory of our services to
   Christ. Now then, if I sacrifice to my own net: if I aim at my own
   credit or profit, and give the glory of all I do to self; then do I
   "sow to the flesh," and was never yet cast out of self, but act only
   from a natural conscience. But if I give the glory of all my strength
   and life in duty only to God; if I magnify grace in all, and can truly
   say in all I do, Yet not I; then am I truly cast out of self, and do
   what I do with a renewed conscience.

   6. Though a natural conscience may put a man much upon service, yet it
   never presses to the attainment of holiness. So that he carrieth an
   unsanctified heart under all. How long was Judas a professor, and yet
   not one dram of grace had he. The foolish virgins, you know, "took
   their lamps, but took no oil in their vessels;" that is, they looked
   more after a profession, than after a sanctification. But now, when a
   renewed conscience putteth a man upon duty, it is succeeded with the
   growth of holiness. As grace helpeth to the doing of duty, so duty
   helpeth to the growing of grace; a believer is the more holy and the
   more heavenly, by his being much in duties.

   Now then, if I am much in a life of duties, and yet a stranger to a
   life of holiness; if I maintain a high profession, and yet have not a
   true work of sanctification; if, like children in the rickets, I grow
   big in the head, but weak in the feet; then have I gifts and parts, but
   no grace; and though I am much in service, yet have I but a natural
   conscience. But, on the other band, if the holiness of my conversation
   carrieth a proportion to my profession; if I am not "a hearer of the
   word. only, but a doer of it;" if grace groweth in seasons of duty,
   then do I act in the things of God from a renewed conscience.

   7. And lastly, If a natural conscience be the spring of duty, why then
   this spring runs fastest at first, and so abateth, and at last drieth
   up. But if a renewed conscience, a sanctified heart, be the spring of
   duty, then this spring will never dry up. It will run always, from
   first to last, and run quicker at last than first: "I know thy works,
   and the last to be more than the first. The righteous shall hold on his
   way; and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger."

   Question. But you will say, Why doth that man abate and languish in his
   duties, that doth them from a natural conscience, more than he that
   doth them from a renewed conscience?

   Answer. The reason is, because they grow upon a fallible root, a
   decaying root, and that is nature. Nature is a fading root, and so are
   all its fruits fading; but the duties done by a renewed conscience, are
   fruits that grow upon a lasting root; and that is Christ. "Gifts have
   their root in nature, but grace hath its root in Christ:" and therefore
   the weakest grace shall outlive the greatest gifts and parts; because
   there is life in the root of the one, and not in that of the other.
   Gifts and grace differ like the leather of your shoe, and the skin of
   your foot. Make a pair of shoes that have the thickest soles, and if
   you go much in them, the leather weareth out, and in a little time a
   man's foot cometh to the ground; but now a man that goeth barefoot all
   his days, the skin of his feet does not wear out. Why should not the
   sole of his foot sooner wear out than the sole of his shoe; for the
   leather is much thicker than the skin? The reason is, because there is
   life in the one, and not in the other; there is life in the skin of the
   foot, and therefore that holdeth out, and groweth thicker and thicker,
   harder and harder; but there is no life in the sole of his shoe, and
   therefore that weareth out, and waxeth thinner and thinner: so it is
   with gifts and grace. Now then, if I decay and abate, and grow weary of
   a profession, and fall away at last; if I begin in the spirit, and end
   in the flesh; then was all I did from a natural conscience: but if I
   grow and hold out, if I persevere to the end, and my "last works be
   more than my first," then I act from a renewed conscience.

   And thus I have, in seven things, answered that question, namely, If
   conscience may go thus far in putting a man upon duties, then what
   difference is there between this natural conscience in hypocrites and
   sinners, and renewed conscience in believers?

   And that is the first answer to the main query, namely, "Whence is it
   that many men go so far, as that they come to be almost Christians?" It
   is to answer the call of conscience.

   Secondly, It is from the power of the word under which they live.
   Though the word doth not work effectually upon all, yet it hath a great
   power upon the hearts of sinners to reform them, though not to renew
   them.

   1. It hath a discerning, discovering power: "The word of God is quick
   and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the
   dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow; and
   is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." This is the
   glass wherein every one may see what man he is. As the light of the sun
   discovers the little motes, so the light of the word, shining into
   conscience, discovers little sins.

   2. The word hath the power of a law. It gives law to the whole soul;
   binds conscience. It is, therefore, frequently called the law in
   Scripture: "Unless thy law had been my delight, &c.--To the law and to
   the testimony." This is spoken of the whole word of God, which is
   therefore called a law, because of its binding power upon the
   conscience.

   3. It hath a judging power: "The word that I have spoken, the same
   shall judge him at the last day." The sentence that God will pass upon
   sinners hereafter, is no other than what the word passeth upon him
   here. The judgment of God, is not a day wherein God will pass any new
   sentence; but it is such a day wherein God will make a solemn, public
   ratification of the judgment passed by the ministry of the word upon
   souls here. This I gather clearly from Matthew xviii. 18: "Whatsoever
   ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye
   shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven:" so that, by bringing
   a man's heart to the word, and trying it by that, he may quickly know
   what that sentence is that God will pass upon his soul in the last day:
   for as the judgment of the word is now, such will the judgment of God
   be concerning him in the last day.

   Indeed, there is a twofold power, farther than this, in the word. It
   hath a begetting and saving power: but this is put forth only upon
   some. But the other is more extensive, and hath a great causality upon
   a profession of goodness, even among them that have no grace.

   A man that is under this threefold power of discerning law and
   judgment, that hath his heart ransacked and discovered, his conscience
   bound and awed, his state and sinful condition judged and condemned;
   may take up a resolution of a new life, and convert himself to great
   profession of religion.

   Thirdly, A man may go far in this course of profession from affectation
   of applause and credit, and to get a name in the world. As it is said
   of the Pharisees, they "love to pray in the marketplaces, and in the
   corners of the streets, to be seen of men." Many are of Machiavel's
   principle,--That the appearance of virtue is to be sought; because,
   though the use of it is a trouble, yet the credit of it is a help.
   Jerome, in his Epistle to Julian, calls such, "the base bond-slaves of
   common fame." Many a man hath that for credit, that he will not do for
   conscience; and owns religion more for the sake of lust, than for the
   sake of Christ: thus making God's stream to turn the devil's mill.

   Fourthly, It is from a desire of salvation. There is in all men a
   desire of salvation: it is natural to every being to love and seek its
   own preservation. "Who will show us any good?"--This is the language of
   nature, seeking happiness to itself.

   Many a man may be carried so far out in the desires of salvation, as to
   do many things to obtain it. So did the young man: "Good Master, what
   good things shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?" He went far,
   and did much, obeying many commands, and all out of a desire of
   salvation. So, then, put these together, and there is an answer to that
   question.

   "The call of conscience--the power of the word--the affectation of
   credit--and the desire of salvation." These may carry a man so far as
   to be almost a Christian.

  QUESTION III.

   Whence is it that many are but almost Christians when they have gone
   thus far? What is the cause of this

   Answer. I might multiply answers to this question, but I shall instance
   in two only, which I judge the most material.

   First, It is for want of right and sound conviction. If a man be not
   thoroughly convinced of sin, and his heart truly broken, whatever his
   profession of godliness may be, yet he will be sure to miscarry. Every
   work of conviction is not a thorough work: there are convictions that
   are not only natural and rational, but not from the powerful work of
   the Spirit of God.

   Rational conviction is "that which proceeds from the working of a
   natural conscience, charging guilt from the light of nature, by the
   help of those common principles of reason that are in all men." This is
   the conviction you read of, Rom. ii. 14, 15. It is said that the
   Gentiles who had not the law, yet had their consciences bearing
   witness, and accusing or excusing one another. Though they had not the
   light of Scripture, yet they had convictions from the light of nature.
   Now, by the help of the Gospel light, these convictions may be much
   improved, and yet the heart not renewed.

   But then there is a spiritual conviction and this is that work of the
   spirit of God upon the sinner's heart by the word, whereby the guilt
   and filth of sin is fully discovered, and the tiro and misery of a
   natural state distinctly set home upon the conscience, to the dread and
   terror of the sinner whilst he abides in that state and condition. And
   this is the conviction that is a sound and thorough work. Many have
   their convictions, but not this spiritual conviction.

   Query. Now you will say, "Suppose I am at any time under conviction,
   how shall I know whether my convictions be only from a natural
   conscience, or whether they be from the Spirit of God?"

   Answer. I should digress too much to draw out the solution of this
   question to its just length. I shall, therefore, in five things only,
   lay down the most considerable difference between the one and the
   other.

   1. Natural convictions reach chiefly to open and scandalous sins. Sins
   against the light of nature; for natural conviction can reach no
   farther than natural light. But spiritual conviction reaches to secret,
   inward, and undiscerned sins; such as hypocrisy, formality,
   lukewarmness, deadness, and hardness of heart, &c.

   Observe, then, whether your trouble for sin looks inward as well as
   outward, and reaches not only to open sins, but to secret lusts, to
   inward and spiritual sins; and if so, this is a sure sign of the work
   of the Spirit, because the trouble occasioned by these sins, bears a
   more immediate relation to the holiness" of God, who only is offended
   by them; they being such as none else can see or know.

   2. Natural convictions deal only with a man's conversation, not with
   his state and condition: with sins actual, not original. But spiritual
   conviction reaches to all sins; to sins of heart, as well as sins of
   life; to the sin of our nature, as well as the sins of practice; to the
   sin that is born in us, as well as the sin that is done by us. Where
   the Spirit of the Lord cometh to work effectually in any soul, he
   holdeth the glass of the law before the sinner's eyes, and openeth his
   eyes to look into the glass, and to see all that deformity and
   filthiness that is in his heart and nature.

   The apostle Paul said, "I had not known sin but by the law." How can
   this be true, that he had not known sin but by the law, when the light
   of nature discovers sin? It is said of the Gentiles, that having not
   the law, they had a law to themselves. This sin, therefore, that the
   apostle speaks of, is not to be understood of sin actual, but of sin
   original: "I had not known the pollution of nature, that fountain of
   sin that is within; this I had not known but by the law." And, indeed,
   this is a discovery that natural light cannot make.

   It is true, the philosopher could say, "That lust is the first and
   chief of all sins." But I cannot think he meant it of original sin, but
   of the inordinacy of appetite and desire, at most; for I find that the
   wisest of the philosophers understood nothing of original sin. Hear
   Seneca: "Sin is not born with thee, but brought in since."

   Quintilian saith, "It is more marvel that any one man sins, than that
   all men should live honestly; sin is so against the nature of
   men."--How blind were they in this point! And so was Paul, till the
   Spirit of the Lord discovered it to him by the word, and indeed, this
   is a discovery proper to the Spirit. It is he that makes the sinner see
   all the deformity and filthiness that is within; it is he that pulleth
   off all the sinner's rags, and makes him see his naked and wretched
   condition; it is he that shows us the blindness of the mind, the
   stubbornness of the will, the disorderedness of the affections, the
   searedness of the conscience, the plague of our hearts, and the sin of
   our natures, and therein the desperateness of our state.

   3. Natural convictions carry the soul out to look more on the evil that
   comes by sin, than on the evil that is in sin. So that the soul under
   this conviction is more troubled at the dread of hell, and wrath, and
   damnation, than at the vileness and heinous nature of sin. But now
   spiritual convictions work the soul into a greater sensibleness of the
   evil that is in sin, than of the evil that conies by sin: the dishonor
   done to God by walking contrary to his will; the wounds that are made
   in the heart of Christ; the grief that the holy Spirit of God is put
   to,--this wounds the soul more than a thousand hells.

   4. Natural convictions are not durable, they "are quickly worn out:"
   they are like a slight cut in the skin, that bleeds a little, and is
   sore for the present, but is soon healed again, and in a few days not
   so much as a scar to be seen. But spiritual convictions are durable,
   they cannot be worn out, they abide in the soul till they have reached
   their end, which is the change of the sinner.

   The convictions of the Spirit are like a deep wound in the flesh, that
   goes to the bone, and seems to endanger the life of the patient, and is
   not healed but with great skill, and when it is healed leaves a scar
   behind it, that when the patient is well, yet he can say, "Here is the
   mark of my wound, which will never wear out." So a soul that is under
   spiritual conviction--his wound is deep, and not to be healed, but by
   the great skill of the heavenly Physician: and when it is healed, there
   are the tokens of it remaining in the soul, that can never be worn out;
   so that the soul may say, "Here are the marks and signs of my
   conviction still in my soul."

   5. Natural convictions make the soul shy of God. Guilt works fear, and
   fear causes estrangedness. Thus it was with Adam, when he saw his
   nakedness he ran away and hid himself from God. Now spiritual
   convictions drive not the soul from God, but unto God. Ephraim's
   conviction was spiritual, and he runs to God, "Turn thou me, and I
   shall be turned." So that there is, you see, a great difference between
   conviction and conversion: between that which is natural and that which
   is spiritual; that which is common, and that which is saving. Yea, such
   is the difference, that though a man hath never so much of the former,
   yet if he be without the latter, he is but almost a Christian, and
   therefore we have great reason to inquire more after this spiritual
   conviction. For,

   1. Spiritual conviction is an essential part of sound conversion.
   Conversion begins here; true conversion begins in convictions, and true
   convictions end in conversion. Till the sinner be convinced of sin, he
   can never be converted from sin; Christ's coming was as a Saviour to
   die for sinners; and the Spirit's coming is to convince us as sinners,
   that we may close with Christ as a Saviour: till sin be thoroughly
   discovered to us, interest in the blood of Christ cannot rightly be
   claimed by us; nay, so long as sin is unseen, Christ will be unsought.
   "They that be whole need not the physician, but they that are sick."

   2. Slight and common convictions, when they are but skin-deep, are the
   cause of much hypocrisy: slight convictions may bring the soul to clasp
   about Christ, but not to close with Christ; and this is the guise of a
   hypocrite. I know no other rise and spring of hypocrisy, like this of
   slight convictions: this hath filled the church of Christ with
   hypocrites. Nay, it is not only the spring of hypocrisy, but it is also
   the spring of apostasy. What was the cause that the seed was said to
   wither away? It was because it had no deepness of earth. Where there is
   thorough conviction, there is a depth of earth in the heart, and there
   the seed of the word grows; but where convictions are slight and
   common, there the seed withers for want of depth: so that you see
   clearly, in this one instance, whence it is that many are but almost
   Christians, when they have gone so far in religion, to wit, for want of
   sound convictions.

   Secondly, And this hath a near relation to the former: "It is for want
   of a thorough work of grace first wrought in the heart:" where this is
   not, all a man's following profession comes to nothing; that scholar is
   never like to read well, that will needs be in his Grammar before he is
   out of his Primer: doth that is not wrought well in the loom, will
   never wear well, nor wear long, it will do little service; so that
   Christian that doth not come well off the loom, that hath not a
   thorough work of grace in his heart, will never wear well; he will
   shrink in the wetting, and never do much service for God. It is not the
   pruning of a bad tree that will make it bring forth good fruit; but the
   tree must be made good, before the fruit can be good.

   He that takes up a profession of religion with an unbroken heart, will
   never serve Christ in that profession with his whole heart. If there be
   not a true change in that man's heart, that yet goes far, and does much
   in the ways of God, to be sure he will either die a hypocrite or an
   apostate.

   Look, as in nature, if a man be not well born, but prove crooked or
   misshapen in the birth, why, he will be crooked as long as he lives;
   you may bolster or stuff out his clothes to conceal it, but the
   crookedness, the deformity remains still; you may hide it, but you
   cannot help it; it may be covered, but it cannot be cured. So it is in
   this case. If a man come into a profession of religion, but be not
   right born; if he be not "begotten of God, and born of the Spirit;" if
   there be not a thorough work of grace in his heart, all his profession
   of religion will never mend him; he may be bolstered out by a life of
   duties, but he will be but a hypocrite at last, for want of a thorough
   work at first; a form of godliness may cover his crookedness, but will
   never cure it.

   A man can never be a true Christian, nor accepted of God, though in the
   highest profession of religion, without a work of grace in the heart.
   For,

   1. There must be an answerableness in the frame of that man's heart
   that would be accepted of God, to the duties done by him; the spirit
   and affections within, must carry a proportion to his profession
   without; prayer without faith, obedience to the law given, without fear
   and holy reverence of the lawgiver, God abhors: acts of internal
   worship must answer the duties of external worship. Now where there is
   no grace wrought in the heart, there can never be any proportion or
   answerableness in the frame of that man's heart, to the duties done by
   him.

   2. Those duties that find acceptance with God, must be done in
   sincerity. God doth not take our duties by tale, nor judge of us
   according to the frequency of our performances, but according to the
   sincerity of our hearts in the performance. It is this that commends
   both the doer and the duty to God; with sincerity, God accepts the
   least we do; without sincerity, God rejects the most we do, or can do.
   This is that temper of spirit which God highly delights in: "They that
   are of a froward heart are an abomination to the Lord, but such as are
   upright in the way are his delight." The apostle gives it a great
   epithet; he calls it, in 2 Cor. i. 12, the sincerity of God; that is,
   such a sincerity as is his special work upon the soul, setting the
   heart right and upright before him in all his ways. This is the crown
   of all our graces, and the condemnation of all our duties. Thousands
   perish, and go to hell in the midst of all their performances and
   duties, merely for want of a little sincerity of heart to God.

   Now where there is not a change of state, a work of grace in the heart,
   there can be no sincerity to God-ward; for this is not an herb that
   grows in nature's garden: "The heart of man is naturally deceitful and
   desperately wicked:" more opposite to sincerity than to anything; as
   things corrupted carry a greater dissimilitude to what they were than
   to anything else which they never were.

   "God made man upright." Now man voluntarily losing this, is become more
   unlike himself than anything below himself; he is more like a lion, a
   wolf, a bear, a serpent, a toad, than to a man in innocency. So that it
   is impossible to find sincerity in any soul till there be a work of
   grace wrought there by the Spirit of God; and hence it is that a man is
   but almost a Christian when he hath done all.
     __________________________________________________________________

  QUESTION IV.

   What is the reason that many go no farther in the profession of
   religion, than to be almost Christians?

   Reason 1. It is because they deceive themselves in the truth of their
   own condition; they mistake their state, and think it good and safe,
   when it is bad and dangerous. A man may look upon himself as a member
   of Christ, and yet God may look upon him as a vessel of wrath: as a
   child of God, by looking more upon his sins than his graces, more upon
   his failings than his faith, more upon indwelling lusts than renewing
   grace, may think his case very bad when yet it is very good: "I am
   black," saith the spouse; "and. yet," saith Christ, "O thou fairest
   among women!" So the sinner, by looking more upon his duties than his
   sins, may think he sees his name written in the book of life, and yet
   be in the account of God a very reprobate.

   There is nothing more common than for a man to "think himself something
   when he is nothing;" and so he "deceives himself." Many a man blesses
   himself in his interest in Christ, when he is indeed a stranger to him.
   Many a man thinks his sin pardoned, when alas! "he is still in the gall
   of bitterness, and bond of iniquity." Many a man thinks he hath grace,
   when he hath none: "There is," saith Solomon, "that makes himself rich,
   and yet hath nothing." This was the very temper of Laodicea: "Thou
   sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing;
   and knowest not," (pray mind that,) "that thou art wretched, and
   miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked."

   Thou knowest not; as bad as she was, she thought her state good; as
   poor as she was in grace, she thought she was rich; "as miserable and
   naked as she was, yet she thought she had need of nothing."

   Now there are several rises or grounds of this mistake. I will name
   five to you.

   First, The desperate deceitfulness of the heart of every natural man.
   "The heart is deceitful above all things." The Hebrew word is the same
   with Jacob's name. Now you know he was a supplanter of his brother
   Esau: "He is rightly called Jacob," saith he, "for he hath supplanted
   one these two times." So the word signifies, to be fraudulent, subtle,
   deceitful, and supplanting. Thus is the heart of every natural man
   "deceitful above all things."

   You read of the deceitfulness of the tongue.

   And of the deceitfulness of riches.

   And of the deceitfulness of beauty.

   And of the deceitfulness of friends.

   But yet the heart is deceitful above them all. Nay, you read of the
   deceitfulness of Satan, yet truly a man's heart is a greater deceiver
   than he; for he could never deceive a man, if his own heart did not
   deceive him. Now it is from hence that a man presumes upon the goodness
   of his case, from the desperate treachery of his own heart.

   How common is it for men to boast of the goodness of their hearts! "I
   thank God, though I do not make such a show and pretence as some do,
   yet I have as good a heart as the best." O do but hear Solomon in this
   case: "He that trusteth Ill his own heart is a fool." Will any wise
   man, commit his money to the cut-purse? Will he trust a cheat? It is a
   good rule, Remember to distrust;--and it was Austin's prayer, That man
   that trusts to his own heart, shall be sure to find himself deceived at
   last.

   Secondly, This mistake arises from the pride of a man's spirit; there
   is a proud heart in every natural man: there was much of this pride in
   Adam's sin, and there is much of it in all Adam's sons. It is a radical
   sin, and from hence arises this overweening opinion of a man's state
   and condition. Solomon saith, "Be not righteous overmuch." Austin,
   speaking occasionally of these words, saith, it is "not meant of the
   righteousness of the wise man, but the pride of the presumptuous man."
   Now in this sense every carnal man is righteous overmuch; though he
   hath none of that righteousness which commends him to God, to wit, the
   righteousness of Christ, yet he hath too much of that righteousness
   which commends him to himself, and that is self-righteousness.

   A proud man hath an eye to see his beauty, but not his deformity; his
   parts, but not his spots; his seeming righteousness, but not his real
   wretchedness. "It must be a work of grace that must show a man the want
   of grace." The haughty eye looks upward, but the humble eye looks
   downward, and therefore this is the believer's motto, "The least of
   saints, the greatest of sinners;" but the carnal man's motto is, "I
   thank God I am not as other men."

   Thirdly, Many deceive themselves with common grace instead of saving,
   through that resemblance that is between them. As many take counterfeit
   money for current coin, so do too many take common grace for true. Saul
   took the devil for Samuel, because he appeared in the mantle of Samuel:
   so many take common grace for saving, because it is like saving grace;
   a man may be under a supernatural work, and yet fall short of a saving
   work; the first raiseth nature, the second only reneweth nature: though
   every saving work of the Spirit be supernatural, yet every supernatural
   work of the Spirit is not saving; and hence many deceive their own
   souls, by taking a supernatural work for a saving work.

   Fourthly, Many mistake a profession of religion for a work of
   conversion, and outside reformation for a sure sign of inward
   regeneration. If the outside of the cup be washed, then they think all
   is clean, though it be never so foul within. This is the common rock
   that so many souls split upon, to their eternal hazard, taking up a
   form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.

   Fifthly, Want of a home application of the law of God to the heart and
   conscience, to discover to a man the true state and condition he is in.
   Where this is wanting, a man will sit down short of a true work of
   grace, and will reckon his case better than it is. That is a notable
   passage which the apostle hints concerning himself: "I was alive
   without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I
   died." Here you have an account of the different apprehensions Paul had
   of his condition with and without the word.

   1. Here is his apprehension of his condition without the word: "I was
   alive," saith he, "without the law." Paul had the law, for He was a
   Pharisee; and they had the "form of knowledge, and of the truth of the
   law:" therefore, when he saith he was "without the law," you must not
   take him literally, but spiritually: he was without the power and
   efficacy of it upon his heart and conscience, convincing, and
   awakening, and discovering sin; and so long as this was the case, be
   doubted not of his state--he was confident of the goodness of his
   condition. This he hinted when he saith, "I was alive," but then,

   2. Here is his apprehension of his condition with the word, and that is
   quite contrary to what it was before: "when the commandment came,"
   saith he, "then sin revived, and I died." When the word of the Lord
   came with power upon his soul, when the Spirit of God set it home
   effectually upon his conscience, that is meant by the coming of the
   commandment; "then sin revived, and I died;" that is, I saw the
   desperateness of my case, and the filthiness of all my
   self-righteousness. Then, my hope ceased, and my confidence failed;
   and, as before, I thought myself alive, and my sin dead; so when God
   had awakened conscience by the word, then I saw my sin alive and
   powerful, and myself dead and miserable. So that this is the first
   reason why men go no further in the profession of religion, than to be
   almost Christians. It is because they mistake their state, and think it
   good when it is not; which mistake is five-fold.

   1. A deceitful heart.

   2. A proud spirit.

   3. Taking common grace for saving.

   4. Outward reformation, for true regeneration.

   5. Want of home application of the law of God to the heart and
   conscience.

   Reason 2. It is from Satan's cunning, who, if He cannot keep sinners in
   their open profaneness, then he labors to persuade them to take up with
   a form of godliness. If he cannot entice them on in their lusts, with a
   total neglect of heaven, then he entices them into such a profession as
   is sure to fall short of heaven. He will consent to the leaving some
   sin, so as we do but keep the rest; and to the doing of some duties, so
   as we neglect the rest. Nay, rather than part with his interest in the
   soul, he will yield far to our profession of religion, and consent to
   anything but our conversion, and closing with Christ for salvation: he
   cares not which way we come to hell, so as he gets us but thither at
   last.

   Reason 3. It is from worldly and carnal policy. This is a great
   hindrance to many: policy many times enters caveats against piety. Jehu
   will not part with his calves lest he hazard his kingdom. Among many
   men there would be more zeal and honesty, were there less design and
   policy. There is an honest policy that helps religion, but carnal
   policy hinders it.

   We are commanded "to be wise as serpents:" now, "the serpent is the
   subtlest of creatures:" but then we must be as "innocent as doves." If
   piety be without policy, it wants security; if policy be without piety,
   it wants integrity. Piety without policy is too simple to be safe; and
   policy without piety is too subtle to be good. Let men be as wise, as
   prudent, as subtle, as watchful as they will, but then let it be in the
   way of God; let it be joined with holiness and integrity. That is a
   cursed wisdom that forbids a man to launch any further out in the
   depths of religion, than he can see the land, lest he be taken in a
   storm before he can make safe to shore again.

   Reason 4. There are some lusts espoused in the heart, that hinder a
   hearty close with Christ. Though they bid fair yet they come not to
   God's terms: "The young man would have eternal life;" and he bid fair
   for it: a willing obedience to every command but one, but only one; and
   will not God abate him one? Is he so severe? Will he not come down a
   little in his terms, when man rises so high? Must man yield all? Will
   God yield nothing? No, my brethren, he that underbids for heaven, shall
   as surely lose it, as he that will give nothing for it. He that will
   not give all he hath--part with all for that "pearl of price"--shall as
   surely go without it, as he that never once cheapens it. The not coming
   up to God's terms is the ruin of thousands of souls; nay, it is that
   upon which all that perish, do perish. A naked sinner to a naked
   Christ; a bleeding, broken sinner, to a bleeding, broken Christ--these
   are God's terms.

   Most professors are like iron between two equal loadstones. God draws,
   and they propend towards God.; and the world draws, and they incline to
   the world. They are between both; they would not leave God for the
   world, if they might not be engaged to leave the world. for God. But if
   they must part with all--with every lust, every darling, every beloved
   sin--why, then, the spirit of Demas possesses them, and God is forsaken
   by them.

   My brethren, this is the great reason why many that are come to be
   almost Christians go no farther. Some one beloved lust or other hinders
   them, and after a long and high profession, parts them and Christ
   forever; they did run well, but here it is that they give out, and
   after all fall short, and perish to eternity.

   Thus having answered these four questions, namely,

   1. How far a man may go in the way to heaven, and yet be but almost a
   Christian.

   2. Whence it is that a man goeth so far as to be almost a Christian.

   3. When it is that a man is but almost a Christian, when he has gone
   thus far.

   4. What is the reason men go no farther in religion, than to be almost
   Christians?
     __________________________________________________________________

Application

   I proceed now to the Application.

   Inference 1. That salvation is not so easy a thing as it is imagined to
   be. This is attested by our Lord Jesus Christ himself: "Strait is the
   gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there be that
   find it." The gate of conversion is a very strait gate, and yet every
   man that would be saved eternally, must enter in at this strait gate;
   for salvation is impossible without it: "Except a man be born again,"
   born from above, "he cannot see the kingdom of God."

   Not that this gate is strait simply, and in respect of itself:--No; for
   converting grace is free. The gate of mercy stands open all the day
   long. In the tenders of gospel grace, none are excluded, unless they
   exclude themselves. Christ doth not say, If such and such will come to
   me, I will not cast them out;'" but "him that cometh unto me," be he
   who or what he will, if he hath a heart to close with me, "I will in
   nowise cast him out." He saith not, "If this or that man will, here is
   water of life for him;" but, "If any man will, let him take the water
   of life freely." Christ grudgeth mercy to none; though salvation was
   dearly purchased for us, yet it is freely proffered us.

   So that the gate which leadeth to life is not strait on Christ's part,
   or in respect of itself, but it is strait in respect of us, because of
   our lusts and corruptions, which make the entrance difficult. A
   needle's eye is big enough for a thread to pass through, but it is a
   strait passage for a cable rope: either the needle's eye must be
   enlarged, or the cable rope must be untwisted, or the entrance is
   impossible. So it is in this case--the gate of conversion is a very
   strait passage for a carnal, corrupt sinner to go in at. The soul can
   never pass through with any one lust beloved and espoused; and,
   therefore, the sinner must be untwisted from every lust: he must lay
   aside the love of every sin, or he can never enter in at this gate, for
   it is a strait gate. And when he is in at this strait gate, he meeteth
   with a narrow way to walk in: so our Lord Christ saith, "Narrow is the
   way that leadeth to life;" and what way is this, but the way of
   sanctification? "For without holiness no man shall ever see the Lord."

   Now this way of sanctification is a very narrow way, for it lies over
   the neck of every lust, and in the exercise of every grace, subduing
   the one, and improving the other; dying daily, and yet living daily;
   dying to sin and living to God:--this is the way of sanctification! And
   O, how few are there that walk in this way! The broad way hath many
   travellers in it, but this narrow way is like the ways of Canaan in the
   days of Shamgar. It is said, "In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath,
   the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through
   by-ways." In the Hebrew, it is, "through crooked ways:" the way of
   holiness is by the most an unoccupied way--so saith the prophet. "A way
   shall there be, and it shall be called the way of holiness, the unclean
   shall not pass over it; no lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beasts
   shall go up thereon; but the redeemed shall walk there." The unclean,
   and the lion, and the ravenous beast, they are in the crooked ways:
   none but the redeemed of the Lord walk in the way of the Lord.

   It is no wonder, then, that our Lord Christ saith of life, that "few
   there be that find it," when the gate is strait, and the way narrow,
   that leadeth to it. Many pretend to walk in the narrow way, but they
   never entered in at the strait gate; and many pretend to have entered
   in at the strait gate, but they walk not in the narrow way.

   It is a very common thing for a man to perish upon a mistake of his
   way; to go on in those paths that take hold of hell, and yet hope to
   find heaven at last. Those twenty parts, fore-mentioned, run into
   destruction, and yet many choose them, and walk in them as the way of
   salvation. As many profane and open sinners perish by choosing the way
   of death, so many formal professors perish by mistaking the way of
   life. This I gather from what our Lord Christ saith "Few there be that
   find it;" which doth clearly imply what in Luke xii. 24, he doth
   plainly express, to wit, that many seek it; many seek to enter in, and
   yet are not able; many run far, and yet do not "so run as to obtain;"
   many bid fair for the Pearl of price, and yet go without it. Hell is
   had with ease, but the "kingdom of heaven suffers violence."

   Inference 2. If many go thus far in the way to heaven, and yet
   miscarry, O then, what shall be the end of them who fall short of
   these! If he shall perish who is almost a Christian, what shall he do
   who is not .at all a Christian! If he that owneth Christ, and
   professeth Christ, and leaveth many sins for Christ, may be damned
   notwithstanding; what then shall his doom be that disowneth Christ, and
   refuseth to part with one sin, one lust, one oath for Christ; nay, that
   openly blasphemeth the precious name of Christ! If he that is outwardly
   sanctified shall yet be eternally rejected, what will the case be of
   such as are openly unsanctified--that have not only the plague of a bad
   heart within, but also the plague-sore of a profane life without?, If
   the formal professor must be shut out, surely then the filthy
   adulterer, swinish drunkard, the deep swearer, the profane
   Sabbath-breaker, the foul-mouthed scoffer, yea, and every carnal sinner
   much more. If there be a wo to him that falleth short of heaven, then
   how sad is the wo to him who falls short of them that fall short of
   heaven! Ah, that God would make this an awakening word to sinners that
   are asleep in sin, without the least fear of death, or dread of
   damnation!

Use of Examination

   Use of Examination.

   Are there many in the world that are almost and yet but almost
   Christians? Why, then, "it is time for us to call our condition into
   question, and to make a more narrow scrutiny into the truth of our
   spiritual estate;" what it is, whether it be right or not; whether we
   are sound and sincere in our profession of religion, or not. When our
   Lord Christ told his disciples, "One of you shall betray me," every one
   began presently to reflect upon himself; "Master, is it I? Master, is
   it I?" So should we do, when the Lord discovers to us from his word,
   how many there are under the profession of religion that are but almost
   Christians, we should straightway reflect upon our hearts, "Lord, is it
   I? Is my heart unsound. Am I but almost a Christian? Am I one of them
   that shall miscarry at last? Am I a hypocrite under the profession of
   religion? Have I a form of godliness without the power?"

   There are two questions of very great importance, which we should every
   one of us often put to ourselves:--

   What am I?

   Where am I?

   1. What am 1? Am I a child of God or not? Am I sincere in religion, or
   am I only a hypocrite under a profession?

   2. Where am I? Am I yet in a natural state, or a state of grace? Am I
   yet in the old root, in old Adam; or am I in the root Christ Jesus? Am
   I in the covenant of works that Ministers only wrath and death? or am I
   in the covenant of grace, that ministers life and peace?

   Indeed, this is the first thing a man should look at: there must be a
   change of state, before there can be a change of heart: we must come
   under a change of covenant, before we can be under a change of
   condition; for the new heart and the new spirit is promised in the new
   covenant. There is nothing of that to be heard of in the old: now a man
   must be under the new covenant, before he can receive the blessing
   promised in the new covenant; he must be in a new covenant-state,
   before he can receive a new covenant-heart. No mercy, no pardon, no
   change, no conversion, no grace dispensed out of covenant; therefore
   this should be our great inquiry; for if we know not where we are, we
   cannot know what we are; and if we know not what we are, we cannot be
   what we should be; namely, altogether Christians. Let me then, I
   beseech you, press this duty upon you that are professors. Try your own
   hearts; "examine yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove your
   own selves."--I urge this upon most cogent arguments.

   1. Because many rest in a notion of godliness and outward shows of
   religion, and yet remain in their natural condition. Many "are hearers
   of the word," but "not doers of it," "and so deceive their own souls."
   Some neither hear nor do; these are profane sinners. Some both hear and
   do; these are true believers. Some hear, but they do not do; these are
   hypocritical professors.

   He that slights the ordinances cannot be a true Christian; but yet it
   is possible a man may own them, and profess them, and yet be no true
   Christian. Who would trust to a profession, that shall see Judas a
   disciple, an apostle, a preacher of the gospel, one that cast out
   devils, to be cast out himself? "He is not a Jew who is one outwardly,
   neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh: but he is a
   Jew which is one inwardly: and circumcision is that of the heart, in
   the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of
   God."

   2. "Because errors in the first foundation are very dangerous." If we
   be not right in the main, in the fundamental work; if the foundation be
   not laid in grace in the heart, all our following profession comes to
   nothing: the house is built upon a sandy foundation, and though it may
   stand for awhile, yet "when the floods come, and the winds blow and
   beat upon it, great will be the fall of it."

   3. "Because many are the deceits that our souls are liable to in this
   case." There are many things like grace that are not grace: now it is
   the likeness and similitude of things that deceives, and makes one
   thing to be taken for another. Many take gifts for grace, common
   knowledge for saving knowledge; whereas a man may have great gifts, and
   yet no grace; great knowledge, and yet not Jesus Christ.

   Some take common grace for saving; whereas, a man may believe all the
   truths of the gospel, all the promises, all the threatenings, all the
   articles of the creed, to be true, and yet perish for want of saving
   grace.

   Some take morality and restraining grace for piety and renewing grace;
   whereas it is common to have sin much restrained, where the heart is
   not renewed.

   Some are deceived with a half-work, taking conviction for conversion,
   reformation for regeneration; we have many mermaid-Christians. Or, like
   Nebuchadnezzar's image, head of gold, and feet of clay. The devil
   cheats most men by a synecdoche, putting a part for the whole; partial
   obedience to some commands, for universal obedience to all. Endless are
   the delusions that Satan fastens upon souls, for want of this
   self-search. it is necessary, therefore, that we try our state, lest we
   take the shadow for the substance, and embrace a cloud instead of Juno.

   4. Satan will try us at one time or other. He will winnow us and sift
   us to the bottom; and if we now rest in a groundless confidence, it
   will then end in a comfortless despair. Nay, God himself will search
   and try us at the day of judgment especially; and who can abide that
   trial, that never tries his own heart?

   5. Whatsoever a man's state be, whether he be altogether a Christian or
   not, whether his principle be sound or not, yet it is good to examine
   his own heart. if he find his heart good, his principles right and
   sound, this will be matter of rejoicing. If he find his heart rotten,
   his principles false and unsound, the discovery is in order to a
   renewing. If a man have a disease upon him, and know it, he may send to
   the physician in time but what a sad vexation will it be, not to see a
   disease till it be past cure? So for a man to be graceless, and not see
   it till it be too late, to think himself a Christian when he is not,
   and that he is in the right way to heaven, when he is in the ready way
   to hell, and yet not know it, till a death-bed or a judgment-day
   confute his confidence--this is the most irrecoverable misery.

   These are the grounds upon which I press this duty, of examining our
   state. O that God would help us in the doing this necessary duty!

   Question. You say, "But how shall I come to know whether I am almost or
   altogether a Christian? If a man may go so far, and yet miscarry, how
   shall I know when my foundation is right--when I am a Christian
   indeed?"

   Answer 1. The altogether Christian closes with, and accepts of Christ
   upon Gospel terms. True union makes a true Christian: many close with
   Christ, but it is upon their own terms they take him and own him, but
   not as God offers him. The terms upon which God in the gospel offers
   Christ, are, that we shall accept of a broken Christ with a broken
   heart, and yet a whole Christ with the whole heart. A broken Christ
   with a broken heart, as a witness of our humility; a whole Christ with
   a whole heart, as a witness of our sincerity. A broken Christ respects
   his suffering for sin; a broken heart respects our sense of sin; a
   whole Christ includes all his offices; a whole heart includes all our
   faculties. Christ is a King, Priest, and Prophet, and all as Mediator.
   Without any one of these offices, the work of salvation could not have
   been completed. As a Priest, he redeems us; as a Prophet, he instructs
   us; as a King, he sanctifies and saves us. Therefore, the apostle says,
   "He is made to us a God of wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
   redemption." Righteousness and redemption flow from him, as a Priest,
   wisdom, as a Prophet, sanctification, as a King.

   Now many embrace Christ as a Priest, but yet they own him not as a King
   and Prophet; they like to share in his righteousness, but not to
   partake of his holiness; they would be redeemed by him, but they would
   not submit to him; they would be saved by his blood, but not submit to
   his power. Many love the privileges of the gospel, but not the duties
   of the gospel. Now these are but almost Christians, notwithstanding
   their close with Christ; for it is upon their own terms, but not upon
   God's. The offices of Christ may be distinguished, but they can never
   be divided. But the true Christian owns Christ in all his offices he
   doth not only close with him as Jesus, but as Lord Jesus: he says with
   Thomas, "My Lord, and my God." He doth not only believe in the merit of
   his death, but also conforms to the manner of his life. As he believes
   in him, so he lives to him: he takes him for his wisdom, as well as for
   his righteousness; for his sanctification, as well as his redemption.

   2. The altogether Christian hath a thorough work of grace and
   sanctification wrought in the heart, as a spring of duties.
   Regeneration is a whole change; "all old things are done away, and all
   things become new." It is a perfect work, as to parts, though not as to
   degrees. Carnal men do duties, but they are from an unsanctified heart,
   and that spoils all. A new piece of cloth never doth well in an old
   garment, for the rent is but made worse. When a man's heart is
   thoroughly renewed by grace, the mind savingly enlightened, the
   conscience thoroughly convinced, the will truly humbled and subdued,
   the affections spiritually raised and sanctified; and when mind, and
   will, and conscience, and affections, all join issue to help on with
   the performance of the duties commanded; then is a man altogether a
   Christian.

   3. He that is altogether a Christian, looks to the manner, as well as
   to the matter of his duties. Not only that they be done, but how they
   be done. He knows the Christian's privileges lie in pronouns, but his
   duty in adverbs: it must not be only bonum, good, but it must be bene,
   that good must be rightly done.

   Here the almost Christian fails, he doth the same duties that others do
   for the matter, but he doth them not in the same manner; while he minds
   the substance, he regards not the circumstance; if he pray, he regards
   not faith and fervency in prayer; if he hear, he doth not mind Christ's
   rule, "Take heed how you hear;" if he obey, he looks not to the frame
   of his heart in obeying, and therefore miscarries in all he doth: any
   of these defects spoil the good of every duty.

   4. "The altogether Christian is known by his sincerity in all his
   performances." Whatever a man does in the duties of the gospel, he
   cannot be a Christian without sincerity. Now, the almost Christian
   fails in this; for though he doth much, prays much, hears much, obeys
   much, yet he is a hypocrite under all.

   5. He that is altogether a Christian, hath an "answerableness within to
   the law without." There is a connaturalness between the word of God and
   the will of the Christian; his heart is, as it were, the transcript of
   the law; the same holiness that is commanded in his word, is implanted
   in the heart; the same conformity to Christ, that is enjoined by the
   word of God, is wrought in the soul by the Spirit of God; the same
   obedience which the word requireth of him, the Lord enableth him to
   perform, by his grace bestowed on him. This is that which is promised
   in the new covenant "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write
   it in their hearts." Now the writing his law in us, is nothing else but
   his working that grace and holiness in us which the law commandeth and
   requireth of us.

   In the old-covenant administration, God wrote his laws only upon tables
   of stone, but not upon the heart; and therefore, though God wrote them,
   yet they broke them; but in the new-covenant administration, God
   provides new tables: not tables of stone, but "the fleshly tables of
   the heart," and writes his laws there, that there might be a law
   within, answerable to the law without. And this every true Christian
   hath. So that he may say in his measure, as our Lord Christ did, "I
   delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is within my heart." Every
   believer hath a light within him, not guiding him to despise and
   slight, but to prize and walk by the light without him; the word
   commands him to walk in the light, and the light directs him to walk
   according to the word. Moreover, from this impression of the law upon
   the heart, obedience and conformity to God becomes the choice and
   delight of the soul; for holiness is the very nature of the new
   creature: so that if there were no scripture, no Bible to guide him,
   yet he would be holy, for he hath received "grace for grace;" there is
   a grace within to answer to the word of grace without. Now, the almost
   Christian is a stranger to this law of God within; he may have some
   conformity to the word in outward conversation, but he cannot have this
   answerableness to the word in inward constitution.

   6. The altogether Christian is much in duty, and yet much above duty:
   much in duty, in regard of performances, much above duty, in regard of
   dependence much in duty by obeying but much above duty by believing. He
   lives in his obedience, but he doth not live upon his obedience, but
   upon Christ and his righteousness. The almost Christian fails in this.
   He is much in duty, but not above it, but rests in it; he works for
   rest, and he rests in his works. He cannot come to believe and obey
   too; if he believes, then he thinks there is no need of obedience, and
   so casts off that; if he be much in obedience, then he casts off
   believing, and thinks there is no need of that. He cannot say with
   David, "I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments." The
   more a man is in duty, and the more above it; the more in doing, and
   more in believing, the more a Christian.

   7. "He that is altogether a Christian is universal in his obedience."
   He doth not obey one command and neglect another, do one duty and cast
   off another; but he hath respect to all the commands, he endeavors to
   leave every sin, and love every duty.

   The almost Christian fails in this, his obedience is partial and
   piece-meal; if he obeys one command, he breaks another; the duties that
   least cross his lust, he is much in; but those that do, he lays aside.

   The Pharisees "fasted, prayed, paid tithes," &c., but they did not lay
   aside their covetousness, their oppression; they "devoured widows'
   houses," they were unnatural to parents.

   8. "The altogether Christian makes God's glory the chief end of all his
   performances." If he pray, or hear, or give, or fast, or repent, or
   obey, &c., God's glory is the main end of all. It is true, he may have
   somewhat else at the hither end of his work, but God is at the further
   end: as Moses's rod swallowed up the magicians' rods, so God's glory is
   the ultimate end that swallows up all his other ends. Now the almost
   Christian fails in this, his ends are corrupt and selfish; God may
   possibly be at the hither end of his work, but self is at the other
   end; for he that was never truly cast out of himself, can have no
   higher end than himself.

   Nov then examine thyself by these characters, put the question to thine
   own soul. Dost thou close with Christ upon gospel terms? Is grace in
   the heart the principle of thy performances? Dost thou look to the
   manner, as well as the matter of thy duties? Dost thou do all in
   sincerity? Is there an answerableness within to the law without? Art
   thou much above duty, when much in duty? Is thy obedience universal?
   Lastly, is God's glory the end of all? If so, then thou art not only
   almost but altogether a Christian.

Use of Caution

   Second Use of Caution.--"O take heed of being almost, and yet but
   almost a Christian!" It is a great complaint of God against Ephraim,
   that "he is a cake not turned;" that is, half baked, neither raw nor
   roasted, neither cold nor hot, as Laodicea: "Because thou art neither
   hot nor cold, therefore I will spue thee out of my mouth." This is a
   condition that of all others is greatly unprofitable, exceedingly
   uncomfortable, and desperately dangerous.

   First, "It is greatly unprofitable to be but almost a Christian;" for
   failing in any one point, will ruin us as surely as if we had never
   made any attempts for heaven. It is no advantage to the soul to be
   almost converted; for the little that we want, spoils the good of all
   our attainments. We say, as good never a whit as never the near; there
   is no profit in leaving this or that sin, unless we leave all sin.
   Herod heard John gladly, and did many things, but he kept his Herodias,
   and that ruined him. Judas did many things, prayed much, preached much,
   professed much, but yet his covetousness spoiled all; one sin ruined
   the young man, that had kept all the commands but one. Thus he "that
   offends in one point, is guilty of all." That is, he that lives
   wilfully and allowedly in any one sin, brings the guilt of the
   violation of the whole law of God upon his soul, and that upon a
   twofold account.

   1. Because he manifests the same contempt of the authority of God, in
   the wilful breach of one, as of all.

   2. By allowing himself in the breach of any one command, he shows he
   kept none in obedience and conscience to God; for he that hates sin as
   sin, hates all sin, and he that obeys the command as the express will
   of God, obeys every command. And for this cause the least sin,
   wilfully, and with allowance lived in, spoils the good of all our
   obedience and lays the soul under the whole wrath of God. One leak in a
   ship will sink her, though she be tight every way else. "Gideon had
   seventy sons," and but one bastard, and yet that one bastard destroyed
   all his sons; so may one sin spoil all our services; one lust beloved
   may spoil all our profession, as that one bastard slew all the sons of
   Gideon.

   Secondly, "It is exceedingly uncomfortable as appears in three ways.

   1. "In that such a one is hated of God and men." The world hates him
   because of his profession, and God abhors him because of his
   dissimulation; the world hates him because he seems good, and God hates
   him because he doth but seem so. No person that God hates more than the
   almost Christian: "I would that thou wert either cold or hot;" either
   all a Christian, or not at all a Christian. "Because thou art neither
   cold nor hot, therefore I will spew thee out of my mouth." What a
   loathsome expression doth God here use, to show what an utter
   abhorrency there is in him against lukewarm Christians! How
   uncomfortable then must that condition needs be wherein a man is
   abhorred both of God and man?

   2. "It is uncomfortable in regard of sufferings." For being almost a
   Christian, will bring us into suffering: but being but almost a
   Christian, will never carry us through suffering. In Matt. xiii. 20,
   21, it is said, "He that receiveth the seed into stony ground, the same
   is he that hears the word, and with joy receives it; yet hath he not
   root in himself, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation or
   persecution ariseth because of the word, by-and-by he is offended."

   There are four things observable in these words.

   1. That the stony ground may receive the word with joy.

   2. That it may for some time abide in a profession of it: He dureth for
   a while.

   3. That his profession will expose to suffering; for, mark, persecution
   is said to arise because of the word.

   4. This suffering will cause an apostatizing from profession; for that
   which is here called "offence," is in Luke viii. 13, called falling
   away: "which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away."

   I gather hence, a profession may expose a man as much to suffering as
   the power of godliness: but without the power of godliness there is no
   holding out in a profession under suffering. The world hates the show
   of godliness, and therefore persecutes it; the almost Christian wants
   the substance, and therefore cannot hold out in it.

   Now this must needs be very uncomfortable; if I profess religion, I am
   like to suffer; if I do but profess it, I am never like to endure.

   3. "It is uncomfortable, in regard of that deceit it lays our hopes
   under;" to be deceived of our hopes causeth sorrow as well as shame. He
   that is but almost a Christian, hopes for heaven; but unless he be
   altogether a Christian, he shall never come there. Now to perish with
   hopes of heaven, to go to hell by the gates of glory, to come to the
   very door, and then be shut out, as the five virgins were; to die in
   the wilderness, within the sight of the promised land, at the very
   brinks of Jordan; this must needs be sad. To come within a stride of
   the goal, and yet miss it; to sink within sight of harbor; O how
   uncomfortable is this!

   4. "As it is greatly unprofitable, and exceedingly uncomfortable, to be
   but almost a Christian, so it is desperately dangerous." For,

   1. "This hinders the true work:" A man lies in a fairer capacity for
   conversion, that lies in open enmity and rebellion, than he that sooths
   up himself in the formalities of religion. This I gather from the
   parable of the two sons, which our Lord Christ urged to the professing
   Scribes and Pharisees. "There was a man had two sons; and he came to
   one, and said, Go work today in my vineyard. He said, I will not; but
   afterwards repented and went. And he came to the second, and said
   likewise; and he said, I go, Sir; but went not." The first represents
   the carnal, open sinner, that is called by the word, but refuses, yet
   afterwards repents, and believes. The second represents the
   hypocritical professor, that pretends much, but performs little. Now
   mark how Christ applies this parable: "Verily I say unto you, that the
   publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you."

   And upon this account it is better not to be at all, than to be almost
   a Christian; for the almost hinders the altogether. It is better, in
   this regard, to be a sinner without a profession, than to be a
   professor without conversion: for the one lies fairer for an inward
   change, when the other rests in an outward. Our Lord Christ tells the
   Scribe, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God," yet never like to
   come there. None farther from the kingdom of God than such as are not
   far from the kingdom of God. As for instance, when there lies but one
   lust, one sin between a soul and Christ, that soul is not far from
   Christ: but now, when the soul rests in this nearness to Christ, and
   yet will not part with that one lust for Christ, but thinks his
   condition secured, though that lust be not subdued; who is farther from
   the kingdom of God than he? So our Lord Christ tells the young man,
   "One thing thou lackest." Why he was very near heaven, near being a
   Christian altogether, he was very near being saved; he tells Christ he
   had kept all the commands. He lacked but one thing; I say, but one
   thing: but it was a great thing. That one thing he lacked was more than
   all things he had, for it was the one thing necessary; it was a new
   heart, a work of grace in his soul, a change of state, a heart weaned
   from the world. This was the one thing, and he that lacks this one
   thing, perishes with his all things else.

   2. "This condition is so like a state of grace, that the mistake of it
   for grace is easy and common;" and it is very dangerous to mistake
   anything for grace that is not grace; for in that a man contents
   himself, as if it were grace. Formality doth often dwell next door to
   sincerity, and one sign serves both; and so the house may be easily
   mistaken, and by that means a man may take up his lodging there, and
   never find the way out again.

   What one saith of wisdom, (many might have been wise, had they not
   thought themselves so when they were otherwise) the same I may say of
   grace; many a formal professor might have been a sincere believer, had
   he not mistook his profession for conversion, his duties for grace, and
   so rested in that for sincerity that is but hypocrisy.

   8. "It is a degree of blasphemy to pretend to grace, and yet have no
   grace." I gather this from Rev. ii. 9,--"I know the blasphemy of them
   which say they are Jews, and are not." This place undergoes a variety
   of constructions; Grotius and Paraeus do not make their blasphemy to
   lie in their saying they are Jews, and are not; but to lie in the
   reproaches that these Jews fastened upon Christ, calling him impostor,
   deceiver, one that hath a devil, &c. Brightman goes another way, and
   saith, this was the blasphemy of these Jews; they retained that way of
   worship that was abrogated, and thrust upon God those old rites and
   ceremonies that Jesus Christ had abolished, and nailed to his cross, by
   which they overthrew the glory of Christ, and denied his coming. But I
   conceive the blasphemy of these Jews to lie in this, that they said
   they were Jews and were not. A Jew here is not to be taken literally
   and strictly only, for one of the lineage of Abraham, but it is to be
   taken metonymically for a true believer, one of the spiritual seed of
   Abraham: "He is a Jew who is one inwardly;" so that for a man to say he
   is a Jew when he is not, to profess an interest in Christ when he hath
   none, to say he hath grace when he hath none, this Christ calls
   blasphemy.

   But why should Christ call this blasphemy? This is hypocrisy; but how
   may it be said to be blasphemy? Why, he blasphemes the great attribute
   of God's omnisciency, he doth implicitly deny that God sees and knows
   our hearts and thoughts; for if a man did believe the omnisciency of
   God, that he searches, the heart and sees and knows all within, he
   would not dare to rest in a graceless profession of godliness. This,
   therefore, is blasphemy in the account of Christ.

   4. "It is dangerous to be almost a Christian, in that this stills and
   serves to quiet conscience." Now it is very dangerous to quiet
   conscience with anything but the blood of Christ: it is bad being at
   peace till Christ speak peace. Nothing can truly pacify conscience less
   than that which pacifies God, and that is the blood of the Lord Christ.
   Now the almost Christian quiets conscience, but not with the blood of
   Christ: it is not a peace flowing from Christ's propitiation, but a
   peace rising from a formal profession, not a peace of Christ's giving,
   but a peace of his own making; he silences and bridles conscience with
   a form of godliness, and so makes it give way to an undoing,
   soul-destroying peace; he rocks it asleep in the cradle of duties, and
   then it is a thousand to one it never awaketh more till death or
   judgment.

   Ah, my brethren, it is better to have conscience never quiet, than
   quieted any way but by "the blood of sprinkling:" a good conscience
   unquiet, is the greatest affliction to saints; and an evil conscience
   quiet, is the greatest judgment to sinners.

   5. "It is dangerous to be almost a Christian, in respect of the
   unpardonable sin." The sin that the Scripture saith, "can never be
   forgiven, neither in this world nor in the world to come;" I mean the
   sin against the Holy Ghost. Now such are only capable of sinning that
   sin as are but almost Christians. A true believer cannot; the work of
   grace in his heart, that seed of God which abideth in him, secures him
   against it.

   The profane, ignorant, open sinner cannot; though he live daily and
   hourly in sin, yet he cannot commit this sin, for it must be from an
   enlightened mind. Every sinner, under the gospel, especially sins sadly
   against the Holy Ghost, against the strivings and motions of the
   Spirit: he "resists the Holy Ghost;" but yet this is not the sin
   against the Holy Ghost.

   There must be three ingredients to make up that sin.

   1st, It must be wilful. If we sin wilfully after we have received the
   knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sin."

   2d, "It must be against light and conviction, after we have received
   the knowledge of the truth."

   3d, It must be in resolved malice. Now you shall find all these
   ingredients in the sin of the Pharisees, Matt. xii. 22. Christ heals
   one that was "possessed of the devil;" a great work, which all the
   people wondered at, verse 23. But what say the Pharisees? see verse 24.
   "This fellow casteth out devils by the prince of devils." Now that this
   was the sin against the Holy Ghost, is clear; for it was both wilful
   and malicious, and against clear convictions. They could not but see
   that he was the Son of God, and that this work was a peculiar work of
   the Spirit of God in him and yet they say, he wrought by the devil!
   whereupon Christ charges them with this "sin against the Holy Ghost,"
   verse 31, 32, 33. [4] Now the Pharisees were a sort of great
   professors; whence I gather this conclusion, that it is the professor
   of religion that is the subject of this sin; not the open carnal
   sinner, not the true believer, but the formal professor. Not the
   sinner, for he hath neither light nor grace; not the believer, for he
   hath both light and grace; therefore the formal professor, for he hath
   light but no grace. Here, then, is the great danger of being almost a
   Christian--he is liable to this dreadful unpardonable sin.

   6. "The being but almost a Christian, subjects us to apostasy." He that
   gets no good by walking in the ways of God, will quickly leave them and
   walk no more in them. This I gather from Hosea xiv. 9. "Who is wise,
   and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them?
   for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them,
   but the transgressors shall fall therein."

   "The just shall walk in them." He whose heart is renewed and made right
   with God, he shall keep close to God in his ways.

   "But the transgressor shall walk therein." The word in the Hebrew is
   peshangim, from a word that signifies to prevaricate: so that we may
   read the words thus, "The ways of the Lord are right, and the just
   shall walk in them; but he that prevaricates (that is, a hypocrite,) in
   the ways of God, he shall fall therein."

   An unsound heart will never hold out long in the ways of God: "He was a
   burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to
   rejoice in that light."

   "For a season"--For an hour, a short space, and then they left him. It
   is a notable question Job puts concerning the hypocrite--"Will he
   delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?"

   He may do much, but those two things he cannot do:

   1. He cannot make God his delight.

   2. He cannot persevere in duties at all times, and in all conditions.

   He will be an apostate at last: the scab of hypocrisy usually breaks
   out in the plague-sore of apostasy. Conversion ground is standing,
   ground; it is terra firma; but a graceless profession of religion is a
   slippery ground, and falling ground; Julian the apostate, was first
   Julian the professor. I know it is possible a believer may fall, but
   yet "he rises again, the everlasting arms are underneath;" but when the
   hypocrite falls, who shall help him up? Solomon saith, "Wo to to him
   that is alone when he falls!" that is without interest in Christ. Why
   wo to him? For he hath none to help him up." If Jesus Christ do not
   recover him, who can? David fell and was restored, for he had one to
   help him up; but Judas fell and perished, for he was alone.

   7. "This being but almost a Christian, provokes God to bring dreadful
   spiritual judgments upon a man."

   Barrenness is a spiritual judgment: now this provokes God to give us up
   to barrenness. When Christ found the fig-tree that had leaves but no
   fruit, he pronounces the curse of barrenness upon it: "Never fruit grow
   on thee more." And so Ezek. xlvii. 11: "The miry places thereof, and
   the marshy places thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given to
   salt."

   A spirit of delusion is a sad judgment. Why, this is the almost
   Christian's judgment, that receives the truth, but not in the love of
   it: "Because they received not the love of the truth, that they might
   be saved; for this cause God shall send them strong delusions."

   To lose either light or sight, either ordinances or eyes, is a great
   spiritual judgment. Why, this is the almost Christian's judgment: he
   that profits not under the means of God, provokes God to take away
   either light or sight; either the ordinances from before his eyes, or
   else to bind his eyes under the ordinances.

   To have a hard heart, is a dreadful judgment, and there is no hypocrite
   but he hath a hard heart.

   My brethren, it is a dreadful thing for God to give a man up to
   spiritual judgments! Now this being almost a Christian, provokes God to
   give a man up to spiritual judgments: surely, therefore, it is a very
   dangerous thing to be almost a Christian!

   8. "Being almost and but almost Christians, will exceedingly aggravate
   our damnation." The higher a man rises under the means, the lower he
   falls if he miscarries: he that falls but a little short of heaven,
   will fall deepest into hell; he that hath been nearest to conversion,
   being not converted, shall have the deepest damnation when he is
   judged. Capernaum's sentence shall exceed Sodom's for severity; because
   she exceeded Sodom in the enjoyment of mercy--she received. more from
   God, she knew more of God, she professed much for God, and yet was not
   right with God; therefore, she shall be punished more by God. The
   higher the rise, the greater the fall; the higher the profession, the
   lower the damnation. He miscarrieth with a light in his hand: be
   perisheth under many convictions; and convictions never end but in a
   sound conversion, as in all saints; or in a sad damnation, as in all
   hypocrites. Praying-ground, hearing-ground, professing-ground, and
   conviction-ground, is, of all, the worst ground to perish upon.

   Now, then, to sum up all under this head.

   If to be almost a Christian hinders the true work of conversion; if it
   be easily mistaken for conversion; if it be a degree of blasphemy; if
   this be that which quiets conscience; if this subjects a man to commit
   the unpardonable sin; if it lays us liable to apostasy; if it provokes
   God to give us up to spiritual judgments; and if it be that which
   exceedingly aggravates our damnation; sure then it is a very dangerous
   thing to be almost and but almost a Christian!

   O labor to be altogether Christians, to go farther than they who have
   gone farthest, and yet fall short! This is the great counsel of the
   Holy Ghost: "So run that ye may obtain.--Give diligence to make your
   calling and election sure."

     __________________________________________________________________

Use of Exhortation

   Need you any motives to quicken you up to this important duty?

   Consideration 1. "This is that which is not only commanded by God, but
   that whereunto all the commands of God tend." A perfect conformity of
   heart and life to God, is the sum and substance of all the commands
   both of the Old and the New Testament. As the harlot was for the
   dividing of the child, so Satan is for dividing the heart. He would
   have our love and affections shared between Christ and our lusts; for
   he knows that Christ reckons we love him not ht all, unless we love him
   above all. But God will have all or none: "My son, give me thy heart.
   Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul,
   and with all thy might." Look into the Scripture, and see what that is
   upon which you only stand, and you shall find that God hath fixed it
   upon those great duties which alone tend to the perfection of your
   state as Christians. God hath fixed your only upon believing; only
   believe. God hath fixed your only upon obedience: "Thou shalt worship
   the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." "Only let your
   conversation be such as becometh the gospel of Christ." So that your
   only is fixed by. God upon these two great duties of believing and
   obeying; both which tend to the perfection of your state as Christians.
   Now, shall God command, and shall not we obey? Can there be a higher
   motive to duty than the authority of the great God, whose will is the
   eternal rule of righteousness? "O let us fear God, and keep his
   commandments," for this is the whole duty of man!

   Consideration 2. "The Lord Christ is a Saviour throughout, a perfect
   and complete Mediator." He hath not shed his blood by halves, nor
   satisfied the justice of God, and redeemed sinners by halves. No, but
   he went through with his undertaking; he bore all our sins, and shed
   all his blood: he died to the utmost, satisfied the justice of God to
   the utmost, redeemed sinners to the utmost, and now that he is in
   heaven he intercedeth to the utmost, and is able to save to the utmost.

   It is observed, that our Lord Christ, when he was upon the earth, in
   the days of his flesh, he wrought no half-cures; but whomsoever they
   brought to him for healing, he healed them throughout; "They brought
   unto him all that were diseased, and besought him that they might only
   touch the hem of his garment, and as many as touched were made
   perfectly whole."

   O what an excellent physician is here! none like him! he cureth
   infallibly, suddenly, and perfectly!

   He cureth infallibly. None ever came to him for healing that went
   without it; he never practised upon any that miscarried under his hand.

   He cureth suddenly. No sooner is his garment touched, but his patient
   is healed. The leper, Matt. viii. 3, is no sooner touched, but
   immediately cured; the two blind men, Matt. xx. 34, are no sooner
   touched, but their eyes were immediately opened.

   He cureth perfectly: "As many as were touched, were made perfectly
   whole."

   Now all this was to show what a perfect and complete Saviour Jesus
   Christ would be to all sinners that would come to him. They should.
   find healing in his blood, virtue in his righteousness, and pardon for
   all their sins, whatever they were. Look! as Christ healed all the
   diseases of all that came to him, when he was on earth, so he, pardons
   all the sins, and healeth all the wounds of all those souls that come
   to him, now he is in heaven. He is a Saviour throughout; and shall not
   we be saints throughout? Shall he be altogether a Redeemer; and shall
   not we be altogether believers? O, what a shame is this!

   Consideration 3. "There is enough in religion to engage us to be
   altogether Christians;" and that whether we respect profit or comfort,
   for grace brings both.

   First, "Religion is a gainful thing;" and this is a compelling motive
   that becomes effectual upon all. Gaia is the god whom the world
   worships. What will not men, do, what will they not suffer for gain?
   What journeys do men take by land, what voyages by sea, through hot and
   cold, through fair and foul, through storm and shine, through day and
   night, and all for gain! Now there is no calling so gainful as this of
   religion; it is the most profitable employment we can take up.
   "Godliness is profitable unto all things." It is a great revenue. If it
   be closely followed, it brings in the greatest income. Indeed, some men
   are religious for the world's sake; such shall be sure not to gain: but
   they who are religious for religion's sake, shall be sure not to lose,
   if heaven and earth can recompense them; for "godliness hath the
   promise both of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."

   Ah, who would not be a Christian, when the gain of godliness is so
   great! Many gain much in their worldly calling, but the profit which
   the true believer hath from one hour's communion with God in Christ,
   weigheth down all the gain of the world. "Cursed be that man who counts
   all the gain of the world worth one hour's communion with Jesus
   Christ," saith that noble Marquis, Galeacius Caracciola. It is nowhere
   said in Scripture, "Happy is the man that findeth silver, and the man
   that getteth fine gold." These are of no weight in the balance of the
   sanctuary; but it is said, "Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and
   the man that getteth understanding; for the merchandise of it is better
   than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold."
   By wisdom and understanding here, we are to understand the grace of
   Christ; and so the spirit of God interpreteth it. "Behold the fear of
   the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding."
   Now of all merchants, he that trades in this wisdom and understanding
   will prove the richest man: one grain of godliness out weigheth all the
   gold of Ophir. There is no riches like being rich in grace: for,

   1. This is the most necessary riches; other things are not so. Silver
   and gold are not so: we may be. happy without them. There is but one
   thing necessary, and that is the grace of Jesus Christ in the heart.
   Have this, and have all; want this, and want all.

   2. It is the most substantial gain. The things of this world are more
   shadow than substance. Pleasure, honor, and profit comprehend all
   things in this world, and therefore are the carnal man's trinity. The
   apostle John calls them "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
   and the pride of life;" this, (saith he,) is all that is in the world:
   and truly, if this be all, all is nothing for what is pleasure but a
   dream and conceit? what is honor, but fancy and opinion? and what is
   profit, but a thing of naught? "Why wilt thou set thy eyes upon that
   which is not?" The things of the world have in them no sound substance,
   though foolish, carnal men call them substance. But now grace is a
   substantial good; so our Lord Christ calls it: "That I may cause those
   that love me to inherit substance," to inherit that which is. Grace is
   a reality other things are but show and fancy.

   3. Godliness is the safest gain. The gain of worldly things is always
   with difficulty, but seldom with safety. The soul is often hazarded in
   the over-eager pursuit of worldly things; nay, thousands do pawn, and
   lose, and damn their precious souls eternally, for a little silver and
   gold, which are but the guts and garbage of the earth: "and what is a
   man profited, to gain the whole world, if he lose his own soul?" But
   the gain of godliness is ever with safety to the soul; nay, the soul is
   lost and undone without it, and not saved but by the attainment of it.
   A soul without grace is in a lost and perishing condition: the hazard
   of eternity is never over with us until the grace of Christ Jesus be
   sought by us, and wrought in us.

   4. "Godliness is the surest profit:" as it is safe, so it is sure. Men
   make great ventures for the world, but all runs upon uncertainty. Many
   venture much, and wait long, and yet find no return but disappointment:
   they sow much, and yet reap nothing. But the gain of godliness is sure;
   "to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward."

   And as the things of this world are uncertain in the getting, so they
   are uncertain in the keeping. If men do not undo us, moths may; if
   robbery doth not, rust may; if rust doth not, fire may; to which all
   earthly treasures are incident, as our Lord Christ teaches us, Matt.
   vi. 19. Solomon limneth the world with wings: "Riches make themselves
   wings, and fly as an eagle towards heaven." A man may be rich as Dives
   today, and yet poor as Lazarus to-morrow. O how uncertain are all
   worldly things! But now the true treasure of grace is in the heart,
   that can never be lost. It is out of the reach both of rut and robber.
   "He that gets the world, gets a good he can never keep; but he that
   gets grace, gets a good he shall never lose."

   5. "The profit of godliness lieth not only in this world, but in the
   world to come." All other profit lieth in this world only: riches and
   honor, &c., are called this world's goods, but the riches of godliness
   is chiefly in the other world's goods; in the enjoyment of God, and
   Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, among saints and angels in glory.
   Lo, this is the gain of godliness; "such honor have all his saints."

   6. "The gain of godliness is a durable and eternal gain." All this
   world's goods are perishing; perishing pleasures, perishing honors,
   perishing profits, and perishing comforts. "Riches are not forever,"
   saith Job: "Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?" Gregory
   upon these words observes, that earthly treasures are treasures of
   snow. What pains do children take to scrape and roll the snow together
   to make a snow-ball, which is no sooner done but the heat of the sun
   dissolves it, and it comes to nothing. Why, the treasures of worldly
   men are but treasures of snow. When death and judgment come, they melt
   away, and come to nothing. "Riches profit not in the day of wrath, but
   righteousness delivers from death."

   You see here the great advantage of godliness; so that if we look at
   profit, we shall find enough in religion to engage us to be altogether
   Christians. Or,

   2. "If we look at comfort," religion is the most comfortable
   profession. There are no comforts to be compared to the comforts of
   grace and godliness.

   1. "Worldly comfort is only outward;" it is but skin-deep: "In the
   midst of laughter the heart is sorrowful." But now the comfort that
   flows from godliness is an inward comfort, a spiritual joy; therefore
   it is called gladness of heart. "Thou hast put gladness in my heart:"
   other joy smooths the brow, but this fills the breast.

   2. "Worldly comfort hath a nether spring." The spring of worldly
   comfort is in the creature, in some earthly enjoyment; and, therefore,
   the comfort of worldly men must needs be mixed and muddy: "an unclean
   fountain cannot send forth pure water." But spiritual comfort hath an
   upper spring: the comfort that accompanies godliness, flows from the
   manifestations of the love of God in Christ, from the workings of the
   blessed Spirit in the heart, which is first a counsellor, and then a
   comforter: and therefore the comforts of the saints must needs be pure
   and unmixed comforts; for they flow from a pure spring.

   3. "Worldly comfort is very fading and transitory." "The triumphing of
   the wicked is but short, and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a
   moment." Solomon compares it to the "crackling of thorns under a pot,"
   which is but a blaze, and soon out: so is the comfort of carnal hearts.
   But, now the comfort of godliness is a durable and abiding comfort;
   "your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man shall take from you."
   The comfort of godliness is lasting, and everlasting it abides by us in
   life, in death, and after death.

   First, "It abides by us in life:" grace and peace go together.
   Godliness naturally brings forth comfort and peace: "The effect of
   righteousness shall be peace." It is said of the primitive Christians,
   "They walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy
   Ghost." Every duty done in uprightness and sincerity, reflects some
   comfort upon the soul. "In keeping the` commands, there is great
   reward;" not only for keeping of them, but in keeping of them. As every
   flower, so every duty carries sweetness and refreshing with it.

   Objection. "But who more dejected and disconsolate than saints and
   believers? whose lives are more uncomfortable? whose mouths are more
   filled with complaints, than theirs? If a condition of godliness and
   Christianity be a condition of so much comfort, then why are they
   thus?"

   Solution. That the people of God are oftentimes without comfort, I
   grant: "They may walk in the dark, and have no light." But this is none
   of the products of godliness: grace brings forth no such fruit as this;
   there is a threefold rise and spring of it:--Sin within, Desertion and
   Temptation without.

   1. Sin within. The saints of God are not all spirit, and no flesh; all
   grace, and no sin. They are made up of contrary principles: there is
   light and darkness in the same mind; sin and grace in the same will;
   carnal and spiritual in the same affections; there is "the flesh
   lusting against the Spirit." In all these, and too oft the Lord knows,
   is the believer led away captive by these warring lusts. So was the
   holy apostle himself: "I find then a law, that, when I would do good,
   evil is present with me. I see another law in my members, warring
   against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law
   of sin;" --and this was that which broke his spiritual peace, and
   filled his soul with trouble and complaints, as you see: "O wretched
   man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?" So that
   it is sin that interrupts the peace of God's people. Indwelling lust,
   stirring and breaking forth, must needs cause trouble and grief in the
   soul of a believer; for it is as natural for sin to bring forth
   trouble, as it is for grace to bring forth peace. Every sin contracts a
   new guilt upon the soul, and guilt provokes God; and where there is a
   sense of guilt contracted, and God provoked, there can be no peace, no
   quiet in that soul, till faith procures fresh sprinklings of the blood
   of Jesus Christ upon the conscience.

   2. "Another spring of the believer's trouble and disconsolateness of
   spirit, is the desertions of God;" and this follows upon the former.
   God doth sometimes disappear, and hide himself from his people:
   "Verily, thou art a God that hideth thyself." But the cause of God's
   hiding, is the believer's sinning: "Your iniquities have separated
   between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you." In
   heaven, where there is no sinning, there is no losing the light of
   God's countenance for a moment; and if saints here could serve God
   without corruption, they should enjoy God without desertion; but this
   cannot be. While we are in this state, remaining lusts will stir and
   break forth, and then God will hide his face, and this must needs be
   trouble: "Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled."

   The light of God's countenance, shining upon the soul, is the
   Christian's heaven on this side heaven; and therefore it is no wonder
   if the biding of his face be looked upon by the soul, as one of the
   days of hell. So it was by David: "The sorrows of death compassed me,
   the pains of hell gat hold upon me; I found trouble and sorrow."

   3. "A third spring of that trouble and complaint that brims the banks
   of the Christian's spirit, is the temptations of Satan." He is the
   great enemy of saints, and he envieth the quiet and comfort that their
   hearts are filled with, when his conscience is brimmed with horror and
   terror: and, therefore, though he knows that he cannot destroy their
   peace, yet he labors to disturb their peace. As the blessed Spirit of
   God is first a sanctifier, and then a comforter, working grace in order
   to peace; so this cursed spirit of hell is first a tempter, and then a
   troubler; first persuading to act sin, and then accusing for sin; and
   this is his constant practice upon the spirits of God's people. He
   cannot endure that they should live in the light of God's countenance,
   when himself is doomed to eternal, intolerable darkness.

   And thus you see whence it is that the people of God are often under
   trouble and complaint. All arises from these three springs of Sin
   within, Desertions and Temptations without.

   If the saints could serve God without sinning, and enjoy God without
   withdrawing, and resist Satan without yielding, they might enjoy peace
   and comfort without sorrowing. This must be endeavored constantly here,
   but it will never be attained fully but in heaven. But yet so far as
   grace is the prevailing principle in the heart, and so far as the power
   of godliness is exercised in this life; so far the condition of a child
   of God is a condition of peace; for it is an undoubted truth, that the
   fruit of righteousness shall be peace. But suppose the people of God
   experience little of this comfort in this life, yet,

   2. "They find it in the day of death." Grace and holiness will minister
   unto us then, and that ministration will be peace. A believer hath a
   twofold spring of comfort, each one emptying itself into his soul in a
   dying season; one is from above him, the other is from within him. The
   spring that runs comfort from above him, is the blood of Christ
   sprinkled upon the conscience; the spring that runs comfort from within
   him, is the sincerity of his heart in God's service. When we lie upon a
   death-bed, and can reflect upon our principles and performances in the
   service of God, and there find uprightness and sincerity of heart
   running through all, this must needs be comfort. It was so to Hezekiah:
   "Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a
   perfect heart; and have done that which is good in thy sight."

   Nothing maketh a death-bed so uneasy and hard, as a life spent in the
   service of sin and lust; nothing makes a death-bed so soft and sweet,
   as a life spent in the service of God and Christ. Or put the case, the
   people of God should not meet with this comfort then; yet,

   3. "They shall be sure to find it after death." If time bring none of
   this fruit to ripeness, yet eternity shall; grace in time will be glory
   in eternity; holiness now will be happiness then: "Whatever it is a man
   soweth in this world, that he shall be sure to reap in the next world:
   he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption: but he
   that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting."
   When sin shall end in sorrow and misery, holiness shall end. in joy and
   glory: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the
   joy of thy Lord." Whoever shareth in the grace of Christ in this world,
   shall share in the joys of Christ in the world to come; and that joy
   "is joy unspeakable, and full of glory." Lo, here is the fruit of
   godliness. Say now, if there be not enough in religion, whether we
   respect profit or comfort, to engage us to be Christians throughout?

   Consideration 4. "What an entire resignation wicked men make of
   themselves to their lusts! and shall not we do so to the Lord Christ?"
   They give up themselves without reserve to the pleasures of sin; and
   shall we have our reserves in the service of God? They are altogether
   sinners; and shall not we be altogether saints? They run, and faint
   not, in the service of their lusts; and shall we faint, and not run, in
   the service of Christ? Shall the servants of corruption have their ears
   bored to the door-posts of sin, in token of an entire and perpetual
   service, and shall we not give up ourselves to the Lord Christ, to be
   his forever? Shall others make a "covenant with hell and death," and
   shall not we "join ourselves to God in an everlasting covenant that
   cannot be forgotten?" Shall they take more pains to damn their souls,
   than we do to save ours? and make more speed to a place of vengeance,
   than we do to a crown of righteousness? Which do you judge best, to be
   saved everlastingly, or to perish everlastingly? Which do you count the
   best master, God or the devil? Christ or your lusts? I know you will
   determine it on Christ's side. O then! when others serve their lusts
   with all their hearts, do you serve Christ with all your hearts. If the
   hearts of the sons of men be fully set in them to do evil, then much
   more let the hearts of the sons of God be fully set in them to do good.

   Consideration 5. "If ye be not altogether Christians, ye will never be
   able to appear with comfort before God, nor to stand in the judgment of
   the last and great day." For this sad dilemma will silence every
   hypocrite: if my commands were not holy, just, and good, why didst thou
   own them? If they were holy, just, and good, why dost thou not obey
   them? If Jesus Christ was not worth the having, why didst thou profess
   him? If he was, then why didst thou not cleave to him, and close with
   him? If my ordinances were not appointed to convert and save souls, why
   didst thou sit under them, and rest in the performance of them? Or if
   they were, then why didst thou not submit to the power of them? If
   religion be not good, why dost thou profess it? If it be good, why dost
   thou not practise it? "Friend, how earnest thou in hither, not having
   on a wedding-garment?" If it was not a wedding-feast, why didst thou
   come at the invitation? If it was, then why didst thou come without a
   wedding-garment?

   I would but ask a hypocritical professor of the Gospel, what he will
   answer in that day? Verily you deprive yourselves of all possibility of
   apology in "the day of the righteous judgment of God." It is said of
   the man that had no wedding-garment on, that when Christ came and
   examined him, he was speechless. He that is graceless in a day of
   grace, will be speechless in a day of judgment: professing Christ
   without a heart to close with Christ, will leave our souls inexcusable,
   and make our damnation unavoidable and more intolerable.

   These are the motives to enforce the duty; and O that God would set
   them home upon your hearts and consciences, that you might not dare to
   rest a moment longer in a half-work, or in being Christians within a
   little, but that you might be altogether Christians!

   Question. But you will say possibly, "How shall I do? What means shall
   I use, that I may attain to a thorough work in my heart; that I may be
   no longer almost, but altogether a Christian?"

   Answer. Now I shall lay down three rules of direction instead of many,
   to further and help you in this important duty, and so leave this work
   to God's blessing.

   Direction 1. "Break off all false peace of conscience;" this is the
   devil's bond to hold the soul from seeking after Christ. As there is
   the peace of God so there is the peace of Satan; but they are easily
   known, for they are as contrary as heaven and hell, as light and
   darkness. The peace of God, flows from a work of grace in the soul, and
   is the peace of a regenerate state; but the peace of Satan is the peace
   of an unregenerate state, it is the peace of death; in the grave Job
   saith there is peace--"There the wicked cease from troubling;" so a
   soul dead in sin is full of peace, the wicked one troubleth him not.
   The peace of God in the soul is a peace flowing from removal of guilt,
   by justifying grace--"Being justified by faith in his blood, we have
   peace with God;" but the peace of Satan in the soul arises and is
   maintained by a stupidity of spirit, and insensibility of guilt upon
   the conscience. "The peace of God is a peace from sin that fortifies
   the heart against it: The peace of God that passeth all men's
   understanding, shall, keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
   The more of this peace there is in the soul, the more is the soul
   fortified against sin; but the peace of Satan is peace in sin: "The
   strong man armed keeps the house, and there is all at peace." The
   saint's peace is a peace with God, but not with sin; the sinner's peace
   is a peace with sin, but not with God: and this is a peace better
   broken than kept. It is a false, a dangerous, an undoing peace. My
   brethren, death and judgment will break all peace of conscience, but
   not that which is wrought by Christ in the soul, and is the fruit of
   the "blood of sprinkling:" "when he gives quietness, who can make
   trouble?" Now that peace that death will break, why should you keep?
   Who would be fond of that quietness which the flames of hell will burn
   in sunder? and yet how many travel to hell through the fool's paradise
   of a false peace? O break off this peace! for we can have no peace with
   God in Christ, whilst this peace remains in our hearts. The Lord Christ
   gives no peace to them that will not seek it; and that man will never
   seek it that does not see his need of it; and he that is at peace in
   his lusts sees no need of the peace of Christ. The sinner must be
   wounded for sin, and troubled under it, before Christ will heal his
   wounds, and give him peace from it.

   Direction 2. Labor after a thorough work of conviction; every
   conviction will not do it. The almost Christian hath his convictions as
   well as the true Christian, or else he had never gone so far; but they
   are not sound and right convictions, or else he had gone farther: God
   will have the soul truly sensible of the bitterness of sin, before it
   shall taste the sweetness of mercy. The plough of conviction must go
   deep, and make deep furrows in the heart, before God will sow the
   precious seed of grace and comfort there, that so it may have depth of
   earth to grow in. This is the constant method of God: first to show man
   his sin, then his Saviour; first his danger, then his Redeemer; first
   his wound, then his cure; first his own vileness, then Christ's
   righteousness. We must be brought to cry out, "Unclean, unclean!" to
   mourn for Him whom we have pierced, and then he sets open for us a
   fountain to wash in for sin, and for uncleanness. That is a notable
   place, Job xxxiii. 27, 28. "He looked upon men; and if any say, I have
   sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; he
   will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see
   the light." The sinner must see the unprofitableness of his
   unrighteousness, before he profit by Christ's righteousness. The
   Israelites are first stung with the fiery serpents, and then the brazen
   serpent is set up. Ephraim is first thoroughly convinced, and then
   God's bowels of mercy worked toward him. Thus it was with Paul,
   Manasseh, the jailer, &c. So that this is the unchangeable method of
   God in working grace, to begin with conviction of sin. O therefore
   labor for thorough conviction; and there are three things we should
   especially be convinced of.

   First, Be convinced of the evil of sin; the filthy and heinous nature
   of it. This is the greatest evil in the world; it wrongs God, it wounds
   Christ, it grieves the Holy Spirit, it ruineth a precious soul; all
   other evils are not to be named with this. My brethren, though to do
   sin is the worst work, yet to see sin is the best sight; for sin
   discovered in its vileness, makes Christ to be desired in his fulness.
   But above all, labor to be convinced of the mischief of an unsound
   heart; what an abhorrence it is to God, what certain ruin it brings
   upon the soul. O think often upon the hypocrite's hell. "For this
   people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and
   their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with
   their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their
   heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."

   Secondly, be convinced of the misery and desperate danger of a natural
   condition; for till we see the plague of our hearts and the Misery of
   our state by nature, we shall never be brought off ourselves to seek
   help in another.

   Thirdly, Be convinced of the utter insufficiency and inability of
   anything below Christ Jesus to minister relief to thy soul in this
   case. All things besides Jesus Christ are "physicians of no value;"
   duties, performances, prayers, tears, self-righteousness, avail nothing
   in this case; they make us like the troops of Tema, to return "ashamed
   at our disappointment" from such "failing brooks."

   Alas! it is an infinite righteousness that must satisfy for us, for it
   is an infinite God that is offended by us. If ever thy sin be pardoned,
   it is infinite mercy that must pardon it; if ever thou be reconciled to
   God, it is infinite merit must do it: if ever thy heart be changed, and
   thy state renewed, it is infinite power must effect it; and if ever thy
   soul escape hell, and be saved at last, it is infinite grace must save
   it.

   In these three things right and sound conviction lieth: and wherever
   the Spirit of God worketh these thorough convictions, it is in order to
   a true and sound conversion: for by this means the soul is brought
   under a right qualification for the receiving of Christ.

   You must know; that a sinner can never come to Christ; for he is dead
   in sin, in enmity against Christ, an enemy to God, and the grace of
   God; but there are certain qualifications that come between the soul's
   dead state in sin, and the work of conversion and closing with Christ,
   whereby the soul is put into a capacity of receiving the Lord Jesus
   Christ; for no man is brought immediately out of his dead state and
   made to believe in Jesus Christ; there are some qualifications coming
   in between. Now sound convictions are the right qualifications for the
   sinner's receiving Christ; "for he came not to call the righteous, but
   sinners to repentance;" that is, such as see themselves sinners, and
   thereby in a lost condition. So Luke exemplifies it: "The Son of Man is
   come to seek and to save that which was lost." "He is anointed, and
   sent to bind up the brokenhearted," to comfort all that mourn.

   O therefore, if you would be sound Christians, get sound convictions;
   ask those that are believers indeed, and they will tell you, had it not
   been for their convictions, they had never sought after Christ for
   sanctification and salvation; they will tell you they had perished, if
   they had not perished; they had been in eternal bondage, but for their
   spiritual bondage; had they not been lost as to Christ.

   Direction 3. Never rest in convictions till they end in conversion.
   This is that wherein most men miscarry: they rest in their convictions,
   and take them for conversion, as if sin seen were therefore forgiven,
   as if a sight of the want of grace were the truth of the work of grace.

   That is a notable place in Hosea xiii. 13, "Ephraim is an unwise son,
   for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of
   children." The place of the breaking forth of children is the womb; as
   the child comes out of the womb, so is conversion born out of the womb
   of conviction. Now when the child sticks between the womb and the
   world, it is dangerous, it hazards the life both of mother and child;
   so when a sinner rests in conviction, and goes no farther, but sticks
   "in the place of the breaking forth of children;" this is very
   dangerous, and hazards the life of the soul.

   You that are at any time under convictions, O take heed of resting in
   them, do not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children:
   though it is true, that conviction is the first step to conversion, yet
   it is not conversion; a man may carry his convictions along with him
   into hell.

   What is that which troubleth poor creatures, when they come to die, but
   this--I have not improved my convictions; at such a time I was
   convinced of sin, but yet I went on in sin in the face of my
   convictions; in such a sermon I was convinced of such a duty, but I
   slighted the conviction; I was convinced of my want of Christ, and of
   the readiness of Christ to pardon and save: but, alas! I followed not
   the conviction.

   My brethren, remember this; slighted convictions are the worst death
   bed companions. There are two things especially, which above all
   others, make a death bed very uncomfortable:

   1. "Purposes and promises not performed.

   2. Convictions slighted and not improved?"

   When a man takes up purposes to close with Christ, and yet puts them
   not into execution: and when he is convinced of sin and duty, and yet
   improves not his convictions: O this will sting and wound at last.

   Now therefore, hath the spirit of the Lord been at work in your souls?
   Have you ever been convinced of the evil of sin, of the misery of a
   natural state, of the insufficiency of all things under heaven to help,
   of the fullness and righteousness of Jesus Christ, of the necessity of
   resting upon him for pardon and peace, for sanctification and
   salvation? Have you ever been really convinced of these things? O then,
   as you love your own souls, as ever you hope to be saved at last, and
   enjoy God for ever, improve these convictions, and be sure you rest not
   in them till they rise up to a thorough close with the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and so end in a sound and perfect conversion. Thus shall you be
   not only almost, but altogether a Christian.

  FINIS.
