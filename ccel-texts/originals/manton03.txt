TO THE READER.

   READER,--Dr Thomas Manton was not so unknown to London, nor is he so
   much forgotten, as that his name or writings should need any of my
   commendations. But booksellers expecting such an office, I have great
   reason to be willing to serve thee in serving the memorial of such a
   friend. What he was I need not tell even strangers, after the character
   truly given of him by his friend and mine in his funeral sermon. How
   sound in judgment against extremes in the controversies of these times,
   a great lamenter of the scandalous and dividing mistakes of some
   self-conceited men; how earnestly desirous of the healing of our
   present breaches, and not unacquainted with the proper means and terms,
   of which the author of his funeral sermon and I had more than ordinary
   experience; how hard and successful a student he was, and how frequent
   and laborious a preacher, and how highly and deservedly esteemed;--all
   this, and more, is commonly here known. The small distaste that some
   few had of him I took for part of his honour, who would not win
   reputation with any by flattering them in their mistakes or
   unwarrantable ways. He used not to serve God with that which cost him
   nothing, nor was of their mind who cannot expect or extol God's grace
   without denying those endeavours of man to which his necessary grace
   exciteth them. He knew that without Christ we could do nothing, and yet
   that by Christ's strengthening us we can do all things which God hath
   made necessary to be done by us. He was not of their mind that thought
   it derogatory to the honour of Christ to praise his works in the souls
   or lives of any of his servants, and that it is the honour of his grace
   that his justified ones are graceless; and that their Judge should
   dishonour his own righteousness if he make his disciples more righteous
   personally than scribes and pharisees, and will say to them, Well done,
   good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things,
   enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' He knew how to regard the
   righteousness and intercession of Christ, with pardon of sin and divine
   acceptance, instead of legal personal perfection, without denying
   either the necessity or assigned office of our faith, repentance, or
   evangelical sincerity in obeying him that redeemed and justifieth us.
   He knew the difference between a man's being justified from the charge
   of being liable to damnation as a Christless, impenitent unbeliever and
   ungodly, and being liable to damnation for mere sin as sin, against the
   law of innocency, which required of us no less than personal, perfect,
   perpetual obedience. He greatly lamented the wrong which the truth and
   church underwent from those that neither knew such differences, nor had
   humility enough to suspect their judgments, nor to forbear reviling
   those that had not as confused and unsound apprehensions and
   expressions as themselves.

   But he hath finished his course, and is gone before us, and hath left
   here a dark, self-distracting world, and a church of such as Christ
   will perfect; but, alas! yet lamentably imperfect, as their errors,
   divisions, contentions, and scandals have these thirteen hundred years
   too publicly declared. Children of the light we are, while the world is
   in darkness; but, alas! yet how dim and clouded! With thousands it does
   not so much as convince them of their ignorance, nor maketh them humbly
   suspicious of an erring judgment; so that through the copulation of
   pride and ignorance, few cry out so loud of error as the erroneous, or
   of heresy as the heretical, or of schism as the schismatical; and false
   conceptions are so common among men, that I think with almost all
   mankind the number of false apprehensions in. comparison of the true
   ones is far greater than unhumbled understandings will easily believe;
   and yet, while mankind doth swarm with error, those that least know
   their own cry down even the toleration of that which, alas! we cannot
   cure; and if a multitude of errors must not be tolerated, I know not
   the person that must be tolerated. And who then be they that shall be
   the avengers of other men's mistakes? Christ knew that none are so
   forward to reproach and so backward to bear with the motes in men's
   eyes as they that have beams in their own.

   Among such, what sort of men on earth hath more cried down, error,
   heresy, and schism, than the Papal tribe? Away with them, exterminate
   them, burn them, hath long been their cry, their laws and practice,
   little thinking how they are polluted with error, heresy, and schism
   themselves. The revived attempts of this consuming fiery spirit hath
   made those that dispose of Dr Manton's papers take these against Popery
   as now most seasonable; and their plainness, suited to common
   capacities, may make them to many more useful than more argumentative
   disputations. They that would have such may see errors that are
   unanswerable (I should say unrefutable, for I find that men, and women
   too, can answer anything). I confess myself not thoroughly studied in
   these prophetical parts of the scriptures, and therefore none of the
   fittest to commend such writings, any further than they commend
   themselves. But I am hasting after this my dear departed brother to the
   world of light, where all divine mysteries are unveiled, and life, and
   light, and love are perfected; for which, even at the door, I am,
   though weak, a believing and desiring expectant.

   Rich. Baxter.

SERMON I

   Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   and our gathering together unto him, that you be not soon shaken in
   mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as
   from us, that the day of Christ is at hand.--2 Thes. II. 1, 2.

   THE former chapter was spent in a consolation against troubles, this in
   a caution against error, or to rectify their judgments concerning the
   time of Christ's second coming. In these two first verses, we have the
   manner of proposal, ver. 1; the matter proposed, ver. 2.

   1. The manner of proposal is very pathetical, by way of adjuration or
   obtestation.

   2. The matter. An error had crept in among the Thessalonians concerning
   the speedy and immediate coming of Christ to judgment, while they were
   yet alive; which error the devil set on foot to subvert their faith and
   expose the whole Christian doctrine to contempt.

   First, The manner or obtestation falleth first under our consideration,
   in which two things are mentioned:--

   1. The coming of Christ.

   2. Their gathering together unto him. Obtestations are by those things
   which have great reverence and respect with us, as most likely to
   prevail. Now these two things are mentioned:--

   [1.] As weighty: 2 Tim. iv. 1, I charge thee before God, and the Lord
   Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearance
   and his kingdom.'

   [2.] This was the article mistaken and perverted as to one circum
   stance, the time; but the thing is taken for granted as an
   unquestionable truth, and the support of all their hopes: 2 Thes. i.
   10, When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and admired in
   all them that believe.'

   [3.] This was a famous Christian doctrine with which the apostles
   usually began, in planting religion in any place: 1 Thes. v. 1-3, But
   of the times and the seasons ye have no reason that I write unto you,
   for ye yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as
   a thief in the night,' &c.

   [4.] It was of precious account with them: 2 Tim. iv. 8, Henceforth is
   laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous
   judge shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto them also
   that love his appearing.' So that the obtestation implieth both the
   certainty of their belief, and also their dear account of this article
   of faith; and therefore the sense is: As you do assuredly expect him,
   and love, and look, and long for this day, that it may go well with
   you, and Christ appear to your glory, so be not troubled.

   Doct. 1. That the coming of Christ to the judgment is a truth well
   known, firmly believed, and earnestly desired by all true Christians.

   Doct. 2. That when Christ shall come, all the saints shall be gathered
   together unto him.

   Doct 1. That the coming of Christ to the judgment is a truth well
   known, firmly believed, and earnestly desired by all the saints.

   1. That it is well known, the apostle produceth the testimony of Enoch:
   Jude 14, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints.' David
   often mentioneth it as a thing delighted in by believers; therefore, in
   a poetical, or rather prophetical strain, he calleth upon the heavens,
   earth, sea, and fields to rejoice before the Lord, for he cometh, for
   he cometh to judge the earth; he shall judge the world with
   righteousness, and the people with his truth,' Ps. xcvi. 13; and again,
   Ps. xcviii. 9, he calleth upon the creatures to rejoice before the
   Lord, for he cometh to judge the earth; with righteousness shall he
   judge the world, and the people with equity;' passages which relate,
   not only to the kingdom of the Messiah, as it is exercised now in the
   world, but also to his final act of judging, till which time they are
   not fully verified. Solomon bindeth the whole duty of man upon him by
   this consideration: Eccles. xii. 13, 14, Let us hear the conclusion of
   the whole matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the
   whole duty of man; for God shall bring every work into judgment, with
   every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil.' And the
   apostles, when they went abroad to proselytise the world, usually began
   with this point.

   2. That this is firmly believed by all true Christians. This must needs
   be so, because it is the grand inducement to all piety and godliness,
   and none ever disbelieved it but those the interest of whose lusts
   engaged them to question it: 2 Peter iii. 3-5, Knowing this first, that
   there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own
   lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
   fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
   beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of,'
   &c. Willingly ignorant; their interest puts them upon it, rather than
   their conscience, because this doctrine filleth them with unquiet
   thoughts, that they cannot so securely follow their sinful practices
   till they blot out the fear of it, or banish the thoughts of it out of
   their hearts. But all that obey the teachings of grace (take it for
   objective or subjective grace), they firmly believe it: Titus ii.
   11-13, For the grace of God. that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to
   all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
   should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world,
   looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearance of the great
   God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ.' The sound belief of it is not so
   much encountered with the doubts of the mind, as the inclinations of
   their perverse hearts. Now, the seeming reasons of partial men are not
   to be heard, especially as delivered in a scoffing, malicious way; and
   on the other side, godliness and mortification standeth upon such
   evident reason as man's unquestionable duty, that it needeth not to be
   maintained by a lie and manifest falsehood. Certainly, they that deny
   it do not so much reason against this article of our Christian faith as
   scoff at it; and it is to be imputed to the malignity of their tempers,
   rather than the acuteness or sharpness of their reason that they do not
   believe it. Many things which they urge are a manifest token of the
   contrary; as the calamities of the good: 2 Thes. i. 4, 5, So that we
   glory in you for your faith and patience in all your persecutions and
   tribulations that you endure, which is a manifest token of the
   righteous judgment of God.' The perversion of justice: Eccles. iii. 16,
   17, And moreover, I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
   wickedness was there, and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was
   there; I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
   wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
   work.' Things must be reviewed and judged over again. A state-engine to
   serve order and government. Doth the benefit of mankind need a lie to
   promote it? Doth carnal interest govern the world, or virtue? If mere
   carnal interest, what a confusion would there be of all things? Then
   men might commit all villany, take away men's lives and goods when it
   is their interest, or they could do it safely and secretly, without
   infringement of their interest; servants poison their masters, if they
   could do it without discovery, and there were no sin in it; men prey
   upon others, if it be in the power of their hands; and catch he that
   catch can,' without impunity, would be the truest wisdom. Clear it is,
   virtue cannot be supported without the thoughts of a world to come; and
   it is unreasonable to imagine that God would make a world which cannot
   be governed without falsehood and deceit.

   3. That it is earnestly desired by all true Christians. That is of
   chief respect here; for the apostle conjureth them by all that is dear
   and sacred in their most holy faith; and upon this I will mainly spend
   the first part of this discourse. I shall prove it by these two choice
   pieces of scripture, which describe the communion of the church with
   Christ, or the dispensations of Christ to the church; the one
   concerneth God's internal, the other his external government--the
   Canticles and Revelations. The book of Canticles is ended with this
   desire, vote, and wish: Cant. viii. 14, Make haste my beloved, and be
   like a young hart or roe upon the mountains of spices.' The bride's
   last and great suit to the bridegroom is make haste,' as to his coming
   in glory to judge the world; not that Christ is slack, but the church's
   affections are strong. They that go a-whoring after the world neither
   desire his coming, nor love his appearing; but the spouse would have
   all things hastened that he might return. He cannot come soon enough to
   set the world to rights and complete their happiness; it is that only
   that will perfect their consolation, and therefore would have the
   blessed and longed-for meeting hastened. In the other book, of the
   Revelations, see how it is closed: Rev. xxii. 20, Christ saith, Surely
   I come quickly;' and the church, like a quick echo, saith Even so,
   come, Lord Jesus; come quickly.' It taketh the word out of Christ's
   mouth, and presently improveth the promise into a prayer, and so
   Christ's voice and the church's voice are unisons. The acclamation of
   the saints answereth to his proclamation. Christ saith, I come,' as
   desiring to meet with us. The church answereth, Even so, come,' as
   desiring his fellowship and company. When once faith apprehendeth the
   glorious coming of our Lord Jesus to judgment, love presently desireth
   it, as the most comfortable thing which we can ask of him; that is the
   farewell suit of the church to Christ. If he will grant this, all
   complaints, and sorrow, and sighing will be no more.

   Now I shall give you reasons why this is desired by all true
   Christians.

   1. In respect of him who is to come: his person, that we may see him
   who is our great Lord and Saviour. All that believed anything of Christ
   desired to see him; those that lived before his coming in the flesh:
   John viii. 56, Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw
   it, and was glad;' and the same affection possesseth us that live after
   his coming in the flesh. We know him by hearsay, we have heard much of
   him; he wooeth us by a proxy, as Eliezer, Abraham's servant, did
   Rebekah. Now, Christians would fain see him of whom they have heard,
   and whom they loved, and in whom they have believed: 1 Peter i. 8, Whom
   having not seen, ye love, and^in whom, though now you see him not, yet
   believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory.' They do
   not see Christ, but they have a taste of his goodness: 1 Peter ii. 3,
   If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.' They have felt his
   comforts and live by his life; all that is wanting is but ocular
   vision, that they may see him face to face; therefore they long for his
   coming.

   The excellency of Christ their head shall then be fully revealed;
   therefore it is comfortable to his saints to think of his second
   coming. It is called, the revelation of Christ,' 1 Peter i. 13. Christ
   is now under a veil, retired within the curtain of the heavens. The
   wicked often ask, Where is now your God? and our own unbelieving hearts
   are apt to question the glory of his person and the truth of his
   promises, when his most faithful servants are under disgrace. Christ is
   a glorious king, but little of his glory is seen in the world;
   therefore they desire that he may appear in glory and royalty; we pray
   that his kingdom may come.

   2. The persons desiring; there is somewhat in them to move them to it.

   [1.] The Spirit of Christ: Rev. xxii. 17, The Spirit in the bride
   saith, Come;' the Holy Ghost breedeth this desire in the church. Nature
   saith, It is good to be here; but this is a disposition above nature.
   The flesh saith, Depart; but the Spirit saith, Come. The great work of
   the Spirit is to bring us and Christ together; he cometh from the
   Father and the Son to bring us to the Father by the Son; his business
   is to marry us to Christ; the promise being passed, the spouse longeth
   to see her beloved. It is the Spirit kindleth a desire in us of his
   second coming, when the marriage that is now contracted shall be
   consummated; when the queen shall be brought unto the king in raiment
   of needlework, and shall enter into the palace with him, there to abide
   for ever. Well, then, though guilty sinners would have Christ stay away
   still, and if it might go by voices, the carnal world would never give
   their voice this way, Even so, come, Lord Jesus, come quickly;' no,
   they are of the devils' mind, Why art thou come to torment us before
   the time?' Mat. viii. 29. Thieves and malefactors, if they might have
   the liberty to choose, they would never look nor long for the day of
   assizes; but the Spirit in the bride is another thing, it giveth us
   other inclinations: the sooner Christ cometh the better; they can never
   be soon enough taken up to him, nor he come to them.

   [2.] There are graces planted in us, faith, hope, and love, to move us
   earnestly to desire his coming.

   (I.) Faith believeth Christ will be as good as his word: I will come
   again; if it were not so, I would have told you,' John xiv. 2. And if
   Christ saith in a way of promise, I come,' the church saith, Amen,' in
   a way of faith, even so, come.' If Christ had gone away in discontent,
   and with a threat in his mouth, Ye shall never see my face more, we
   should altogether despair of seeing him again; but he parted in love,
   and left a promise with us, which upholdeth the hearts of believers
   during his absence. Would Christ deceive us, and flatter us into a
   fools' paradise? What need that? He can strike us dead in an instant if
   we do not please him, and we have hitherto found him true in all
   things, and will he fail us at last?

   (2.) Hope, which is faith's handmaid; it looketh for that which we do
   believe, it is the immediate effect of the new creature: 1 Peter i. 3,
   Begotten to a lively hope;' as soon as grace is infused, it discovereth
   itself by its tendency to its end and rest; it came from heaven, and
   carrieth the soul thither.

   (3.) Love is an affection of union; it desireth to be with the party
   loved: Phil. i. 23, I desire to depart, and to be with Christ;'
   therefore its voice is, Come, come.' He hath communion with us in our
   houses of clay; therefore we desire presence with him in his palace of
   glory. His voice now is very sweet when he saith, Come unto me, ye that
   are weary and heavy laden,' but much more will it be so when he saith,
   Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit a kingdom prepared for you
   before the foundations of the world were laid.' Reconciliation with God
   is comfortable, but what will fruition be!

   [3.] Look upon a Christian's privileges; believers then find the fruit
   of their interest in him, and have their reward adjudged to them: Rev.
   xxii. 12, Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me.' Christ
   doth not come empty-handed: it is but maintenance we have from him now,
   but then wages; earnest now, but then the full sum; it is our pay-day,
   yea, rather, it is our crowning-day: 2 Tim. iv. 8, Henceforth is laid
   up for me a crown of righteousness, which God the righteous Judge will
   give me in that day;' 1 Peter v. 4, When the chief Shepherd shall
   appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory, which fadeth not away.'
   Those that have been faithful and diligent in their duty shall not need
   to seek another paymaster; that which Christ giveth us in hand is worth
   all the pains that we lay out in his service; grace and inward peace:
   but then we shall have glory and honour; he will honour us in the sight
   of those that have opposed, contradicted, and despised us: our comfort
   is hidden, but our glory is sensible, and visible, and public before
   all the world.

   Object. But how can true Christians earnestly desire it, when so many
   tremble at the thought of it, for want of assurance of God's love?

   Ans. We suppose a Christian in a right frame, and one that doth prepare
   for his coming; but--

   1. The meanest saint hath some inclination this way. It was one of the
   points of the apostolical catechism: Heb. vi. 2, The doctrine of
   resurrection from the dead, and of eternal judgment:' and the
   apostolical catechism was for the initiating or entering of Christians
   into the faith and profession of the gospel: when they laid the
   foundation, this was one truth which was never omitted, the coming of
   Christ to judgment. Now faith is a believing, not with the mind only,
   but the heart; they were to be affected with what they did
   believe--sapida scientia was the qualification--and not with trembling
   only, for that would deter them from Christianity; but with rejoicing
   of hope, which did invite them to the practice of it: Heb. iii. 6,
   Whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of
   hope firm unto the end;' and indeed what other affection can become the
   thought of Christ's rewards which he will bring with him?

   2. Sometimes there may be a drowsiness and indisposition in the
   children of God when their lamps are not kept burning: Luke xii. 37,
   Blessed are those servants whom, when the Lord cometh, he shall find
   watching;' but the wise virgins slumbered as well as the foolish; and
   so for a season they may be unprepared for his coming by carelessness
   or remission of their watchfulness and neglect of preparation, yet the
   spirit and inclination this way beginneth with the new birth. A wife
   desireth her husband's coming home after a long journey, but it may be
   all things are not ready and in so good order: sometimes all good
   Christians desire the coming of Christ, but sometimes they are not so
   exact and accurate in their walkings, and therefore their affections
   are not so lively; security breedeth deadness, and God is fain to rouse
   us up by sharp afflictions.

   3. The church doth really and heartily desire Christ's coming, though
   they tremble at some circumstances of his coming: there is a degree of
   bondage that hindereth much of our confidence and boldness: 1 John iv.
   17, 18, Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in
   the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world. There
   is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear
   hath torment; he that feareth is not made perfect in love.' While we
   are imperfect there may be some fears how it shall go with us in the
   judgment. The day of judgment may be considered in esse rei, or in esse
   cognito,--the success of the day itself, that we may stand before
   Christ in the judgment, or in our apprehension of it, that we may think
   of it with boldness, confidence, and desire. All sincere persons shall
   speed well in the judgment; but while we are thus weak and imperfect,
   we have little confidence of our sincerity. Certainly the more holy we
   are, the more we are emboldened against judgment to come; therefore we
   must every day get a conscience soundly established against the fears
   of hell and damnation.

   4. To be of such a temper as not at all to value, and prize, and
   delight in it, quencheth all sense of godliness and religion. Surely
   they are not touched with any fear of God who wish it would never come,
   who would be glad in their heart to hear such news; they have the
   spirit of the devil in them who count his coming their burden and
   torment; they cannot say the Lord's Prayer without a fear to be heard,
   and pray, Thy kingdom come,' when they desire it may never be; the
   thought of it casts a damp on their carnal rejoicing; and he that is
   afraid lest his prayers prove true, can never pray heartily; no, not
   with a moral sincerity.

   Use. To press us to keep up a firm belief and an earnest desire of
   Christ's coming; this will make you heavenly-minded: Phil. iii. 20, 21,
   For our conversation is in heaven, where we look for the Saviour, the
   Lord Jesus Christ.' It will engage you to fidelity in your duty; for
   every one of us must give an account of himself to God: 1 John ii. 28,
   And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we
   may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.' To
   watchfulness as well as faithfulness: Luke xxi. 36, Watch ye,
   therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape
   all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son
   of man.' Yea, to diligence, that you may clear up your title and
   interest: Heb. ix. 28, And to them that look for him shall he appear
   the second time, without sin unto salvation;' 2 Peter iii. 14,
   Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, be diligent
   that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.' Oh,
   therefore, let this be a precious truth to you, which you would not
   forego for all the world; if others tremble at the mention of it, still
   carry it so that it may be your comfort and solace. In short, believe
   it strongly, think of it frequently, prepare for it diligently, improve
   it^ fruitfully, to all holy conversation and godliness, yea, to get oil
   not into your lamps only, but vessels,--grace in your hearts, as well
   as profess yourselves to be Christians.

   Doct. 2. That when Christ shall come, all the saints shall be gathered
   together unto him.

   For evidencing this, let me clear to you, that at the day of judgment
   there shall be:--

   1. A congregation.

   2. A segregation.

   3. An aggregation.

   They are all intended, but principally the last.

   1. A congregation: Mat. xxv. 32, Before him shall be gathered all
   nations;' and not only all nations, but all persons: 2 Cor. v. 10, We
   must all (collectivè) appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that
   every one (distributivè) may receive according to the things done in
   his body,' &c. All that have lived from the beginning of the world unto
   that day shall, without exception of any one single person, from the
   least unto the greatest, appear before the tribunal of Christ; no age,
   no sex, or nation, or dignity, or greatness, can excuse us. In the
   world some are too high to be questioned, others too low to be taken
   notice of, but there all are brought forth to undergo their trial;
   there is no shifting or avoiding this day of appearance: Adam will
   there meet with all his posterity at once. Take all the distinctions of
   man kind, infants, and grown persons; I mean infants who die before
   they are in an ordinary way capable of the doctrine of life (the
   scriptures are written for grown persons, the case of infants is more
   obscure), those of them who are born within the church, God is their
   God: Gen. xvii. 7, I will establish my covenant between me and thee,
   and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting
   covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.' Good and
   bad is the next distinction, both sorts come to receive their sentence;
   only the one come to the judgment of condemnation, the other to the
   judgment of absolution: John v. 28, 29, Those that have done good, to
   the resurrection of life, and those that have done evil, to the
   resurrection of condemnation;' Acts xxiv. 15, There shall be a
   resurrection of the dead; both of the just and unjust.' The next
   distinction is men of all callings,--apostles, ministers, private
   Christians. Apostles: Paul expected to be judged: 1 Cor. iv. 4, I know
   nothing of myself, yet am I not thereby justified, but he that judgeth
   me is the Lord;' he speaketh with respect to the execution of the
   apostolical office. Ordinary ministers: Heb. xiii. 17, They watch for
   your souls, as those that must give an account.' If souls miscarry
   through their negligence, they are answerable to God for it. Ordinary
   Christians: Rom. xiv. 12, Every one must give an account of himself to
   God.' Men of all conditions, poor or rich, weak or powerful, high and
   low: Rev. xx. 12, I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God;' I
   mean those that are so distinguished now; these distinctions do not
   outlive time, there all stand on the same level; the ruffling men of
   the world shall then be afraid, and call upon the mountains to cover
   them from the wrath of him that sitteth upon the throne.' Rev. vi. 16.
   The poor are not forgotten; they are God's creatures, and must undergo
   his judgment. Thus shall all people that live scattered up and down in
   the world, how much soever they differ from one another in rites,
   tongues, customs of living, be brought together in one place.

   2. There is a segregation: Mat. xxv. 32, 33, He shall separate the one
   from the other, as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats; and he
   shall set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.'
   There may be now a confusion and mixture of the godly and the wicked,
   as sheep and goats feed in the same pasture; and they may be all raised
   together according to the places where they lived and died; but then a
   perfect separation: good and bad are first gathered together, but the
   good are drawn into a company by them selves, but no pure company, till
   the great Shepherd will judge between cattle and cattle.' Ezek. xxxiv.
   17; He will gather his saints together,' Ps. l. 5; Ps. i. 5, The
   ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the
   congregation of the righteous.' So Mat. xiii. 49, At the end of the
   world the angels shall come, and sever the wicked from among the just.'

   3. An aggregation: believers are gathered together to him for several
   ends:--

   [1.] To make up the number of Christ's train and attendants to wait on
   him: Jude 14, en muriasin hagiais, with his holy ten thousands;' Zech.
   xiv. 5, And the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with him;' 1
   Thes. iv. 17, The dead in Christ shall rise first, and we which are
   alive shall be caught up together in the clouds with them, to meet the
   Lord in the air.'

   [2.] That after judgment we may be solemnly presented to God by head
   and poll. We were given to Christ to be preserved unto the glory we
   were designed for: John xvii. 6, I have manifested thy name unto the
   men which thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were, and thou
   gavest them me;' not by way of alienation, but oppignoration,
   recompense, and charge. Christ is to give an account: John vi. 40, And
   this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the
   Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life.; and I will raise
   him up at the last day.' The form of presentation is, Heb. ii. 13,
   Behold I and the children which God hath given me.'

   [3.] That in one troop we may be brought into his heavenly kingdom:
   John xiv. 3, And if I go, and prepare a place for you, I will come
   again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there ye may be
   also.' The whole flock shall then follow the great Shepherd of the
   sheep into the everlasting fold.

   Use 1. Believe this gathering together to him. We are joined to the
   church of God's elect now by faith only: Heb. xii. 22, 23, Ye are come
   to the general assembly and church of the first-born, which are written
   in heaven,' &c. Pane'guris is a meeting made up of many different
   persons gathered together from several countries into one body and one
   place; as the meeting of all sorts of persons from all the corners of
   Greece to see the Olympic Games was called the pane'guris; people of
   all countries came to behold their agones; so the mystical state of the
   church of the gospel is a general assembly, because it is not confined
   to one nation, but extended to believers of all nations and ages; they
   are drawn into a body, or heavenly society, into one fold, under one
   Shepherd; but they never meet in an actual assembly until the last day,
   which is the great congregation or rendezvous of the saints, so that
   now it is matter of faith.

   2. See you be of the number. When some are admitted, others are thrust
   out: Luke xiii. 28, There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when
   ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the
   kingdom of God, and ye yourselves thrust out;' the wicked shall not
   stand in this congregation. Oh, it is a blessed and a comfortable thing
   when we are made members of the mystical body of Christ, and have hopes
   that we shall be in the number of those that shall meet together in the
   great assembly and congregation of the righteous; that we are trained
   up in the church of Christ, which is the seminary of heaven; that we
   are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the
   saints.

   3. Let us improve it many ways.

   [1.] To comfort us against the paucity of serious walkers and real
   Christians. Alas! now they are but like two or three berries upon the
   top of the uppermost bough; here one, and there another; in some places
   thinner, in others thicker, as God hath service for them; in
   appearance, mikro`n poi'mnion, a little flock,' Luke xii. 32. But take
   all together, they are a general assembly, that are redeemed out of
   every kindred, tongue, and nation,' Rev. v. 9; yea, Rev. vii. 9, a
   great multitude, which none can number, of all kindreds, tongues,
   peoples, and nations.' As few as we are, and as despised as the
   interest of the godly is, we shall not want company in heaven; we see
   few going to heaven, but when we are gathered together we shall see
   that our everlasting companions are many.

   [2.] To comfort us against the distance of Christian friends. We are
   often separated from the society of good Christians whom we love
   dearly, but we shall be gathered together in one congregation. The
   saints are now scattered by Providence; they live in various countries,
   towns, houses, have little comfort of one another. They live where they
   may be most useful; as stars do not shine in a cluster, but are
   dispersed throughout the heaven; and as they are the light of the
   earth, so they are the salt of the earth, which is sprinkled here and
   there, not laid in a heap; sometimes by violence of men, persecution,
   and banishment; sometimes by death, which parts friends, prefects est
   quem putas mortuum, like people in a wreck, got to shore before us. Now
   what a comfort is it to be united to all God's people, which have been,
   are, or shall be, to the end of the world, and to meet in one assembly:
   Mat. xxiv. 31, They shall gather together the elect from the four
   winds, from one end of heaven to another.' The saints shall be gathered
   from all quarters of the earth; though they live in several places,
   several times, many we never saw in the flesh, Christ will assemble
   them all, bring them in unto one place.

   [3.] To comfort them under the degenerated and collapsed state of
   Christianity. (1.) The mixture of the wicked; the good and bad are here
   mixed, they live together in the same kingdoms, cities, societies,
   visible church, family, bed (perhaps), but then a perfect separation:
   Zech. xiv. 21, There shall no more be the Canaanite in the house of the
   Lord of hosts;' Rev. xxi. 27, Nothing that defileth shall enter there:'
   such a difference shall there be between the state of God's church in
   this world, and the world to come: here tares are mingled with wheat,
   good fish with bad in the drag-net; it is hard by discipline to keep
   the sound from the infected. (2.) Discord; the saints are divided in
   affection, but then perfect harmony; they are all gathered together to
   Christ, and have no signs and badges of distinction to herd apart. (3.)
   It is universal with all the saints. (4.) Perpetual, never to part
   more.

SERMON II.

   That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit,
   nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at
   hand.--2 Thes. II. 2.

   WE come now to the matter of the apostle's caution, which is in the
   second verse: That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
   neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the
   day of Christ is at hand.' In which words take notice:--

   1. Of the error disproved: that the day of Christ is at hand.

   2. The effect which this error might produce; trouble and unsettledness
   of mind: that ye be not soon shaken in mind or troubled.

   3. A removal of all the supposed foundations of this error, or the
   means which these impostors used to entice them to embrace it. Three
   are mentioned--spirit, word, and letter.

   [1.] Nor by spirit; that is, pretence of spiritual revelation; be not
   soon shaken in mind by it.

   [2.] Nor by word; some word of the apostle, which they pretended to
   have heard--and that is another sleight of deceivers; some tradition or
   doctrine delivered by the apostle by word of mouth.

   [3.] Nor by letter as from us. This may be understood--(1.) Either of
   some passage in the former epistle; for the apostle saith there, I
   Thes. iv. 17, Then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air;' and
   because he joins himself with them, they thought he should survive
   until that day. Or else those warnings which the apostle gives them: 1
   Thes. v. 1-3, Of the times and seasons I need not write unto them, for
   yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in
   the night,' &c. Now these warnings they might abuse; and this is one
   way by which men may be unsettled and unshaken, i.e., by false glosses
   and interpretations of scripture. (2.) Or rather the sense may be, some
   spurious and counterfeit writings, which was one means of deceit used
   in the primitive times; supposititious or apocryphal legends, wherein
   the apostle might be said to write something, as if Christ should come
   in that age wherein they lived. Now, to obviate this, the apostle is
   supposed to insert that passage, chap. iii. 17, The salutation of Paul
   with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.'

   First, From the error disproved, observe:--

   Doct. That the time of Christ's coming to judgment must be patiently
   expected, not rashly defined or determined; for this is the error which
   the apostle with such earnestness opposeth here.

   But you will say, Is this such an error? Do not the holy apostles
   themselves say, in effect, the same, as the apostle James, chap. v. 8,
   The coming of the Lord draweth nigh;' and the apostle Peter, 1 Peter
   iv. 7; The end of all things is at hand.' Yea, Paul himself, 1 Cor. x.
   11, These are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
   world are come;' and Rom. xiii. 12, The night is far spent, and the day
   is at hand;' where by night is meant the state of ignorance, sin, and
   paganism before conversion; and by the day is meant the state of our
   full regeneration and illumination in eternal glory, when the corrupt
   world shall come to an end, and all shadows shall fly away. As if he
   had said, The morning of the resurrection is at hand, the night is far
   spent--not quite past--and the day is at hand; the night is not
   thoroughly gone, nor the day wholly come, yet, he saith, it is at hand.
   What evil was in this opinion, that the apostle should with such
   vehemency argue and reason against it? Ans. There is some difference in
   the words, for e'ngiken signifies, it draweth near; ene'steken it is
   begun already. But the sense is vastly different; for by these and such
   like expressions the apostle only did intend that the last dispensation
   was then on foot--no other change of dispensation or worship was to be
   expected till the coming of Christ. But I shall more clearly and
   distinctly show--

   1. What reason the apostle had to speak at this rate.

   2. What little reason these seducers had to pervert this speech to
   countenance their hypothesis or supposition.

   1. For the first, the apostle had reason to say the day of the Lord was
   at hand.

   [1.] With respect of faith; for faith gives a kind of presence to
   things: Heb. xi. 1, Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, and
   the evidence of things not seen;' that is, it gives a being, a kind of
   existence, to things future and afar off, and sets them before the eyes
   of our mind, and gives us some sight of them, as if they were already
   come. And therein it agrees with the light of prophecy. Look, as by the
   light of prophecy John saith, Rev. xx. 12, I saw the dead, small and
   great, stand before God, and the books were opened,' &c., so faith doth
   in effect see what it believes. Well, then, faith looking upon things
   distant and absent as near at hand, the apostle had reason to use this
   language to believers, as if the judge were at the door: Phil. iv. 5,
   Let your moderation be known unto all men; the Lord is at hand,' not
   only in regard of his present providence, but also with respect to his
   second coming to judgment; it is as certain to faith as if he were
   already come.

   [2.] With respect of love: love will not account it long to endure the
   hardships of this present world until Christ come to set all things at
   rights. Jacob served seven years for Rachel for the love he bare to
   her, and it seemed to him but a little while,' Gen. xxix. 20. If we had
   any love for Christ, we should be contented to suffer a while for his
   sake. The time is coming when the wicked shall persecute no more, when
   the mouth of iniquity shall be stopped, when the desire and hope of all
   believers shall be satisfied, when the Redeemer's work shall be
   consummated, when the kingdom shall be delivered up to the Father, when
   those that made a jest of this day shall be fully confuted. Faith sees
   the certainty of it, and love makes us hold out till the time come
   about.

   The apostle might speak so, as comparing time with eternity: Ps. xc. 4,
   A thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday, when it is past,
   and as a watch in the night;' 2 Peter iii. 8, One day is with the Lord
   as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.' The longest time
   to eternity is but as a drop lost and spilt in the ocean; and all the
   tediousness of the present life is but like one rainy day to an
   everlasting sunshine: 2 Cor. iv. 17, Our light affliction, which is but
   for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
   glory.' Though troubles are lengthened as long as our lives are, yet
   they are but a moment in respect of eternity; we reckon by time, and
   not by eternity, and therefore these expressions may seem strange to
   us.

   [4.] The apostle speaks this to particular men, whose abode in the
   world is not very long. Eternity and the judgment is at hand, though
   Christ tarry long till the church be completed, and the elect be
   gathered: 2 Peter iii. 9, The Lord is not slack concerning his promise,
   as some men count slackness.' Now, what is long, and what is afar off
   to the whole church, considered in several successions of ages, it is
   short to particular persons. Death soon puts an end to their conflict,
   and then their triumph ensues. And so Christ is ready to judge at all
   times, though the world be not ready to be judged. The coming of Christ
   is uncertain, and hidden for this very purpose, that men in all ages
   might be quickened to faithfulness and watchfulness, and make that
   preparation which is necessary. Now, therefore, it concerns the
   messengers of God to bind men's duty upon them, by showing the nearness
   of it in all the fore-mentioned considerations, that they might be
   always ready; for so we find our Lord himself pressing it: Luke xii.
   40, Be ye therefore ready, for the Son cometh at an hour when ye think
   not;' Mat. xxiv. 42, Watch, therefore, for ye know not what hour your
   Lord cometh.' He may come in a moment; our duty is unquestionable, but
   the time of his coming is uncertain. And to please ourselves with the
   thoughts of a delay, is a mighty deadening thing, and quencheth our
   duty; yea, it is an enticement to all evil; Mat. xxiv. 48, the wicked
   servant took liberty to beat his fellow-servants because of his lord's
   delay. We are bid to be sober and watchful, and always to be looking
   for the coming of the Lord.

   2. The seducers had little reason to pervert this speech to the
   countenance of their hypothesis or supposition, and therefore the
   apostle had very good reason to be zealous in the confutation of this
   hypothesis of the seducers, who maintained that Christ would come in
   that age.

   [1.] To inquire after the time is curiosity: Acts i. 7, It is not for
   you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put into
   his own power.' Those things which God hath reserved to himself, for us
   to inquire after is sinful. It is a great evil to pry into our Master's
   secrets, when we have so many revealed truths to busy our minds about.
   We take it to be a piece of ill-manners to pry into that which is
   purposely concealed; as to break up a secret letter and the like. The
   practising of known duties would prevent this curiosity. These things
   tend not to our profit and edification.

   [2.] Much more was it a sin to fix the time; it was an arrogant
   presumption: Mat. xxiv. 36, For of that day and hour knoweth no man;
   no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.' The peremptory time
   of the day of judgment God keeps to himself, and it is arrogance for
   any to define it and set a time, when God has resolved to keep it
   secret.

   [3.] The fixing of that time did a great deal of hurt.

   (1.) For the present it drew away their minds from their calling,
   because they expected a sudden coming of the Lord. Ill impressions
   either destroy or weaken necessary duties.

   (2.) The least error doth gratify Satan and the interest of his
   kingdom, for he is the father of lies.

   (3/) It might shake their faith in other things when their credulity
   was disproved by the event; the gospel might be brought into contempt
   when their error only was confuted; as many men, who have been
   peremptory in fixing times, afterwards have thrown off their religion.

   (4.) It showed a diseased mind, that they were sick of questions; as
   the apostle speaks, 1 Tim. vi. 4, Doting about questions and strifes of
   words, whereof cometh envy,' &c., when they had so much wholesome food
   to feed upon.

   (5.) It did but engender strife among Christians, begat wranglings and
   disputes in the church: 1 Tim. vi. 4, He is proud, knowing nothing, but
   doting (or sick) about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh
   envy, strife, railing, evil surmisings.'

   Use 1. Let us not fix times. Many of the ancients were too bold this
   way, and we are apt to it. Lactantius peremptorily said, the world
   would endure but two hundred years after his time. So many will fix the
   time of the calling of the Jews, and the destruction of Antichrist
   without evident grounds and reasons. What God hath revealed is enough
   to bear us out in our duty and suffering. In other things let us
   patiently wait; we see reason to do so, when we consider how many men
   have proved false prophets.

   2. Let us not put off the time, and set it at too great a distance.
   Distant things, though never so great, will hardly move us; that which
   men put off they do in effect put away; they put far off the evil day,
   they would not let it come near their minds to have any operation upon
   them. Look, as the stars, those vast globes of light, by reason of the
   distance between us and them, do seem but as so many spangles, so we
   have but a weak sight of what is set at a great distance, and their
   operation on us will be but small; the closer things are, the more they
   will work upon us. One that looks upon what God hath revealed of this
   as sure and near, is more affected with it than others are. Therefore
   set yourselves at the entrance of that world, where you: must
   everlastingly be, and watch and be ready. They that put it off, are apt
   to loiter in their work. If Christ's coming be not near at hand,
   certainly the time of our departure is at hand, and it will not be long
   ere it come about. But this is but introductive to the doctrine of
   Antichrist. Therefore I come to the second thing.

   Secondly, The effect that this error might produce, trouble and
   unsettledness of mind: That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or
   troubled.' In the words there is a twofold metaphor; the one taken from
   a tempest, or sea-storm, as the word plainly implies, that ye be not
   shaken in mind;' and the other word is taken from the sudden alarm of a
   land-fight, which breeds trouble.

   Doct. 1. That errors breed trouble of mind: they do not only trouble
   the church's peace: Gal. v. 12, I would they were even cut off which
   trouble you;' but they hinder tranquillity of mind: Gal. i. 7, There be
   some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.'

   How do errors hinder tranquillity of mind? Partly because it is an
   unsound foundation; it can never yield solid peace. We only find rest
   for the soul in a true religion, and there where it is purely
   professed; others are left to great doubts and uncertainties. The Lord
   seems direct us in this course when we are upon consultation about the
   taking up of a religion: Jer. vi. 16, Stand in the ways, and see, and
   ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye
   shall find rest for your souls.' Soul-rest is only found in God's way,
   and where it is most clearly professed. Partly because whatever false
   peace is bred there, it will at last end in trouble. The apostle
   compares seducers, Jude 13, to raging waves of the sea, foaming out
   their own shame;' and we are told of the locusts that came out of the
   bottomless pit, Rev. ix. 5, that they stung like scorpions.' Every
   erroneous way of religion is comfortless; yea, their doctrine breeds
   anxiety, and vexes the spirit; for they have no true way of quieting
   the conscience; let us therefore detest error, because it is so much
   our interest. It is the property of truth to beget a delectation of
   mind; it is sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.' Verum est bonum
   intellectus--truth is the good of the understanding. Now when we
   understand truth satisfyingly, it breeds an incredible delight; when we
   have been in some perplexities, and begin to find out a truth: Prov.
   xxiv. 13, 14, My son, eat thou honey, because it is good, and the
   honeycomb, which is sweet unto thy taste: so shall the knowledge of
   wisdom be when thou hast found it.' Honey is not so sweet to thy taste
   as this is to thy understanding. When a man hath found out any truth,
   though it be but a natural truth, it breeds its oblectation: much more
   spiritual truth; it is very pleasing to the understanding, and most of
   all when spiritual. Truth is obeyed and practised; for the
   understanding gives us but a sight of it, but obedience gives a taste
   thereof. Our Saviour saith, Mat. xi. 28-30, Come unto me, all ye that
   are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
   you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart. For my yoke is
   easy, and my burden is light.' If you will but come under Christ's
   blessed yoke and sceptre, and that way of religion he hath recommended
   to you, you will find an incredible peace, joy, and oblectation in your
   mind.

   Doct. 2. That Christians should be so established, and have such
   constancy of mind, that they should not be easily shaken and moved from
   the faith.

   1. Let us see how this is pressed. Sometimes it is pressed from the
   encouragement of your great hope: 1 Cor. xv. 58, Be stedfast, and
   unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as you
   know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.' First, he would have
   them stedfast and unmoveable; these two words have their special
   signification, the one is a degree above the other. A man may be
   stedfast in a thing, though he be moved a little in some by-matters;
   but now, since your innocency will bear you out, be not only stedfast
   but immoveable, which is a higher degree; but take it thus, be stedfast
   in yourselves, and unmoveable by the storms of temptation from without:
   a man is stedfast in himself, settled upon his own foundation; and you
   are unmoved when you are strengthened against outward assaults: Acts
   xx. 24, None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto
   me, so I might finish my course with joy.' A man may be settled in the
   knowledge of the truth, but he is not unmoveable except he be fortified
   against all temptations that may draw him off from his profession. Such
   constancy of mind may be well enforced because of our great hope; thus
   it is pleaded for there. Then the absolute necessity of it is urged at
   other times, as Col. i. 23, If ye continue in the faith grounded and
   settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel.' The same
   condition is required to continue as to begin our right in the
   privileges of the gospel. There are some conditions required for the
   beginning, others for the continuing of our right, Now this is
   absolutely required for the continuing of our right, both for present
   reconciliation with God, and future glory; it is upon this condition,
   if ye continue in the faith.'

   2. Let us inquire what is necessary to this constancy and establishment
   of mind, that we may not be soon troubled and shaken; partly that our
   minds may be enlightened to know the truth, and our hearts renewed to
   believe and love the truth; for without this there can never be any
   constancy of mind in religion.

   [1.] A clear conviction of the truth, or certainty of knowledge, a
   rooted assent, or well-grounded persuasion; not some fluctuating
   opinion about it. A half light maketh us very uncertain in our course:
   James i. 8, A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways'--dipsuchos
   akatastatos; first try all things,' 1 Thes. v. 21, then hold fast that
   which is good.' When men resolve upon evidence, or after due
   examination, the truth sticketh the closer and faster by them; but when
   they take up things hand-over-head, they have no firm principles, and
   therefore waver hither and thither, as vessels without ballast are
   tossed with every wave: 2 Peter iii. 16, 17, Beware lest ye also, being
   led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own
   stedfastness'--i'dion sterigmo`n, substantial grounds within
   themselves. They do not stand by the knowledge of others, or the faith
   of others, and consent of others: light chaff is carried about with
   every wind, periphero'menoi: Eph. iv. 14, That ye henceforth be no more
   children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
   doctrine.' They go through all parts of the compass; sometimes this
   wind of error taketh them up, sometimes that; sometimes taking up one
   opinion, then changing it for another: this is the fruit of
   half-convictions.

   [2.] The other part of our basis is a resolution to adhere to the
   truth. What likelihood is there that we should continue, who are not so
   much as resolved so to do? The heart must be established by grace, as
   well as the mind soundly convinced: Heb. xiii. 9, Be not carried about
   with divers and strange doctrines, for it is a good thing that the
   heart be established with grace;' as the apostle speaketh of a purpose
   not to marry: 1 Cor. vii. 37, He that standeth stedfast in his own
   heart,' &c. So here, Acts xxi. 13, I am ready not to be bound only, but
   also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.' A
   firm, thorough resolution is requisite to fortify us against all
   changes in religion; otherwise we are but as trees without a root, or a
   house without a foundation. Now this resolution of the heart is by
   faith and love. Faith: Heb. iii. 12, Take heed lest there be in any of
   you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.' Love:
   2 Thes. ii. 10, They received not the love of the truth, that they
   might be saved; and for this cause God shall send them strong
   delusions, that they shall believe a lie.' We are not only rooted and
   grounded in faith, but rooted and grounded in love:' Eph. iii. 17, That
   Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and
   grounded in love,' &c.

   The opposite to this is levity and inconstancy of mind, that soon
   quitteth truth without difficulty, or without much hesitancy and
   resistance yields to the temptation. The scripture often taketh notice
   of this sudden embracing of error: Gal. i. 6, I marvel that ye are so
   soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto
   another gospel;' and in the text, soon shaken in mind.' Credulity is a
   lightness in believing, when we are like reeds shaken with every wind,
   Mat. xi. 7, and have a faulty easiness, ready to be carried away with
   every doctrine which pretendeth to truth: The simple believeth every
   word,' Prov. xiv. 15. There is a readiness of mind which is good, but
   it goeth on sufficient evidence; so the wisdom that is from above is
   gentle, and easy to be entreated,' James iii. 17; and the Bereans were
   pro'thumoi: Acts xvii. 11, They received the word with all readiness of
   mind, and searched the scriptures, whether these things were so or no.'
   But a readiness of mind differs from a weakness of mind, or a lightness
   in believing upon slender and insufficient grounds: they never receive
   the truth with thorough efficacy, and are prone to error.

   4. The causes of this instability and inconstancy of mind are these:--

   [1.] Lack of solid rooting in the truth; they receive it
   hand-over-head, as the stony ground forthwith sprang up: Mat. xiii. 5,
   20, Anon they receive it with joy;' they do not so soon receive the
   word, but they as soon quit it.

   [2.] Lack of mortification: 2 Tim. iv. 10, Demas hath forsaken us,
   having loved this present world.' Lusts are uncertain; fear of men,
   favour of men, carnal hopes will easily prevail.

   [3.] A certain readiness of mind which disposeth men to conform and
   comply with their company, as the looking-glass representeth every face
   that looketh on it; so they are very changeable, and unstable as water;
   as Zedekiah, Jer. xxxviii. 5, The king is not he that can say you nay;'
   soon turned this way and that way.

   [4.] Want of a thorough inclination to God, so that they are right for
   a while, or in some things, yet they are not universally true to his
   interest: 1 Kings ii. 28, Joab turned after Adonijah, though he turned
   not after Absolom;' Hosea vii. 8, Ephraim is a cake not turned.'

   [5.] Want of holiness and living up to the truths we know: 1 Tim. iii.
   9, Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.' Choice liquors
   are best kept in a clean vessel; men provoke God to desert them and
   leave them to a giddy spirit.

   [6.] Libertinism. Men think they may run from one sect of Christians to
   another, as the wind of interest bloweth. If they were to turn to
   Ethnicism, Turcism, or Judaism, they would die rather than change their
   religion; but they think the differences among Christians are not of
   such moment as to venture anything upon that account. Every truth is
   precious, and must be owned in its season, and it is damnable in itself
   to do anything against conscience, and he that giveth way to a small
   temptation will entertain a greater; as a man that hangeth over a
   precipice, when he lets go his hold, will sink further and further till
   he come to the bottom; therefore, it is good to be faithful in a
   little.

   Use. Let us take heed of this evil credulity and lightness.

   1. Till Christians get a settled and sound judgment they never have
   peace within themselves, for fears and scruples arise in the dark, and
   those that live in error are full of perplexities, and have not that
   tranquillity of spirit which they have who are fully persuaded in their
   own mind: Rom. xiv. 5, Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
   mind.'

   2. If hardened in error, consider your opinions will ordinarily have an
   influence upon your whole religion, and will pervert your carriage
   towards God and men; your prayers will smell of your opinions, and be
   like Balaam's sacrifice, offered to God to engage him against his own
   people; your love will be dispensed according to the interests of your
   faction: 1 Cor. i. 12, 13, Every one of you saith, I am of Paul, and I
   of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ. Is Christ divided?'

   3. The danger of error to others. Vice is like a duel, error a war: 2
   Tim. ii. 17, Their word will eat as doth a canker;' All in Asia have
   turned from me,' 2 Tim. i. 15.

   4. There is danger to yourselves, though the error be not damnable, 1
   Cor. iii. 13. You have not so full communion with God.

   Thirdly, The third thing is the means which these impostors used to
   seduce them from the faith,--spirit, word, letter; by all which the
   apostle would not have them troubled and shaken in mind; none of these
   engines which the seducers used should draw them from the truth. What
   should poor Christians do thus assaulted? Ans. Stick to the apostolical
   doctrine. I shall observe:--

   Doct. That a Christian should be so persuaded in religion that neither
   spirit, nor word, nor writing, should be able to shake or unsettle his
   mind. I shall show you:--

   1. What ways or what means God hath appointed whereby a man may settle
   his choice as to opinions in religion.

   2. That the word of God will sufficiently fortify him against all these
   false ways by which error is wont to be insinuated.

   1. For the first, if a Christian would be established and guided aright
   in the choice of a religion, he must follow both the light of nature
   and scripture.

   [1.] The light of nature, antecedently to any external revelation, will
   sufficiently convince us of the being of God and our dependence upon
   him: Rom. i. 19, 20, That which may be known of God is manifest in
   them, for God hath showed it to them; for the invisible things of him
   from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by
   the things which are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.' For I
   must know there is a God, or else I cannot be certain that he hath
   given us a rule or revelation of his mind. We begin with what is
   natural, and then go on to what is spiritual. Nature will tell us that
   there is one God, the first cause of all things, of infinite power,
   wisdom, and goodness; that it is reasonable he should be served by
   those whom he hath made; that he will reward and punish men as they
   disobey or serve and please him: but how God will be served, how they
   shall be rewarded or punished, or how they shall escape punishment, if
   after a breach they are willing to return to their duty and obedience
   to him, this is revealed in the word of God.

   [2.] The written word shows us the true way of worshipping and pleasing
   God, and being accepted with him; therefore it is a sufficient
   direction to us: there is enough to satisfy conscience, though not to
   please wanton curiosity; as that may quench the thirst of a sober man
   that will not satisfy the lust of a drunkard: there we are made wise
   unto salvation,' 2 Tim. iii. 15--Thou hast known the holy scriptures,
   which are able to make thee wise unto salvation;' and Ps. cxix. 105,
   Thy word is a light unto my feet, and a lantern to my paths.' There we
   have the knowledge of many things evident by the light of nature
   discovered with more clearness and certainty; and that which could not
   be found out by natural light, as salvation by a Redeemer, or the
   remedy of our lapsed estate, which, depending on the sole will and good
   pleasure of God, could not be known till it was manifested and revealed
   by him. When man sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, it was
   necessary that God should some way or other reveal his mind to him by
   word of mouth or by writing. By word of mouth, that is, either by
   oracles or extraordinary messengers. That sufficed while God saw fit to
   reveal but a few truths, or such as did not much burden the memory; and
   men were long-lived, and the church confined within a small compass of
   ground, and not liable to so many miseries and changes as now in the
   latter ages; and then he put it into writing, that men may not obtrude
   upon us their own conceits, but we might have a standard or rule of
   faith and manners: Gal. vi. 16, As many as walk according to this
   rule,' &c.

   [3.] The natural truths contained in the word of God are evident by
   their own light. The supernatural truths, though they are above natural
   light, yet they are not against it, or contrary to it, and do fairly
   accord with those principles which are naturally known; and are
   confirmed,--partly by an antecedent testimony, which is prophecy;
   partly by an innate evidence in their own frame and contexture; partly
   by a subsequent evidence, which is valuable testimony as to matter of
   fact. The antecedent testimony: John v. 39, Search the scriptures, for
   in them ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me;' 2
   Peter i. 19, We have a more sure word of' prophecy, to which we do well
   to give heed, as to a light shining in dark places.' The innate and
   concomitant evidence: 2 Cor. iv. 2-4, We have renounced the hidden
   things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word
   of' God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending
   ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. For if our
   gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the god of this
   world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light
   of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine
   unto them.' The subsequent testimony, the apostles: Acts v. 32, We are
   witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath
   given to them that obey him.' They were eye and ear witnesses of great
   fidelity and credit; their religion forbiddeth them to lie for God, and
   they were accompanied with the mighty power of the Holy Ghost, not only
   in giving them success in the face of the learned world, hunting out
   the devil everywhere, but also by miracles, divers signs, and wonders;
   and they and their followers endured all manner of torments and death
   to witness to the truth of these things, and transmitted them to us
   with assurance of God's owning this doctrine.

   [4.] The word being thus stated and put into a sure record, it is
   intelligible enough, in all necessary matters at least; for if God
   should speak or write darkly to his people, especially in necessary
   things, it is because he could not or would not speak otherwise. The
   former is direct blasphemy: Exod. iv. 11, Who hath made man's mouth?
   have not I, the Lord?' The latter cannot be said, because that is
   contrary to his goodness: Ps. xxv. 8, Good and upright is the Lord,
   therefore will he teach sinners the way.' It is not to be imagined that
   the great and universal king should give a law to mankind, and speak so
   darkly that we should have no sure direction from thence, nor be able
   to know his mind in any of the duties God hath required of us, or
   expose us to great difficulties and hardships in the world. And if he
   had not plainly expressed his will to us, man would never leave writing
   and distinguishing himself out of his duty. Surely he that will venture
   his all for Christ's sake had need of a clear warrant to bear him out,
   for none will hazard all that is near and dear to him but for weighty
   reasons.

   [5.] Besides, the illumination of the Holy Spirit doth accompany this
   word, and make it effectual to us, to show us God as revealed in
   Christ: 2 Cor. iv. 6, God, who commanded the light to shine out of
   darkness, hath shined into our hearts, to give us the light of the
   knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ;' and for
   heaven, Eph. i. 17, 18, Praying that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
   revelation in the knowledge of him; the eyes of your understanding
   being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling,
   and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.' He
   sanctifieth and healeth our souls, and prepareth us for the
   entertainment of the truth, that as natural things are naturally
   discerned, so spiritual things are spiritually discerned: 1 Cor. ii.
   14, The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for
   they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they
   are spiritually discerned.'

   [6.] There are promises of direction made to humble and sincere minds:
   Ps. xxv. 9, The meek shall he guide in judgment, the meek shall he
   teach his way;' to the industrious: Prov. ii. 4, 5, If thou seekest her
   as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures, then shalt thou
   understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God;' to the
   godly and well-disposed: John vii. 17, If any man will do his will, he
   shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
   myself;' so to them that pray much: James i. 5, If any man lack wisdom,
   let him ask it of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth
   not, and it shall be given him.' They that thus sincerely endeavour to
   know the will of God, will come to a sound, established judgment in the
   truth.

   2. A Christian that is thus established, is fortified against spirit,
   word, or writing, or all suggestions that may perplex his mind.

   [1.] Against pretended revelations, called here spirit.

   (1.) Because having his mind thus settled, he may boldly defy all
   revelations pretended to the contrary: Gal. i. 8, Though we, or an
   angel from heaven, preach any other gospel than we have preached, let
   him be accursed.' Any doctrine, if diverse, or different from, or
   besides the written word, much more contrary to it, a Christian may
   reject it, and account it cursed doctrine; therefore neither church,
   nor angel, nor spirit is to be heard against it.

   (2.) Because a Christian is upon better terms, having the written word,
   than if God dealt with him by way of revelations: 2 Peter i. 19, We
   have bebaio'teron lo'gon, a more sure word of prophecy;' comparing it
   with the voice from heaven, of which he spake before; not as if there
   could be any uncertainty in the Lord's voice speaking from heaven, but
   because a transient voice is more easily mistaken or forgotten than an
   authentic standing record; as Samuel thought Eli called him, when it
   was the Lord. It is quoad nos; though God gave evidence of the truth of
   such revelations as he made, yet we have more accommodate means. Our
   Lord intimateth such a thing: Luke xvi. 3l, If they hear not Moses and
   the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the
   dead.' This is the surest ground for faith to rest upon of any that
   ever hath been or can be given to sinners, subject to forgetfulness,
   jealousies, and mistakes.

   (3.) Because it is not rational to expect new revelation, now the canon
   and rule of faith is closed up: Heb. ii. 1, 2, Therefore we ought to
   give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at
   any time we should let them slip,' &c.; Mat. xxviii. 20, Teaching them
   to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you;' John xvii. 29,
   Neither pray I for these alone, but for them which shall believe on me
   through their word.'

   (4.) Because if any such be pretended, it must be tried by the word:
   Isa. viii. 20, To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not
   according to this word, it is because they have no light in them;' so 1
   John iv. 1, Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
   whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone abroad
   into the world.'

   (5.) Because they that despise ordinary means, and pretend to vision,
   revelation, or inspiration, are usually such as are given up by God to
   a vertiginous spirit, and cast into the dungeon of error, for the
   punishment of other sins: Micah ii. 11, If a man walking in the spirit
   of falsehood do lie, he shall be the prophet of this people;' God will
   permit those that are both deceivers and deceived themselves to come
   amongst them for a plague to them. Sleidan giveth sad instances of some
   given up to this fantastical frenzy, that killed their own relations on
   pretence of inspiration, and of others that murdered fifty thousand in
   one day.

   [2.] By word or unwritten tradition. This also should not shake the
   mind of settled Christian, for this hath no constat--no evidence of its
   certainty, and would lay us open to the deceits of men, blinded by
   their own interest and passions; and if such tradition could be
   produced as hath unquestionable authority, it must be tried by the
   scripture, which is everywhere commended as the public standard, and
   true measure and rule, both of faith and manners.

   [3.] Not by epistle as from us.

   (1.) Supposititious writings, which the church in all ages hath
   exploded, having received only those which are unquestionably theirs
   whose names they bear.

   (2.) False expositions. These are confuted by inspection of the
   context, scope of the writer, comparing of obscure places with plain
   and clear. Thus you see what certainty God hath provided for us to
   guide us in the way to eternal life.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON III.

   Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come except
   there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the
   son of perdition.--2 Thes. II. 3.

   IN these words we have these two things:--

   1. A caution against the error set afoot at that time concerning
   Christ's sudden coming to judgment.

   2. The confutation of it. It is disproved by two antecedents and
   forerunners of his coming:--(1.) A general apostasy, or a defection of
   the visible church from the true state of Christianity; (2.) The
   revelation of Antichrist, described here by his names and proper
   titles--1st, That man of sin; and 2dly, Son of perdition.

   I. Let us speak of the general apostasy that must be before Christ's
   coming to judgment; except there come a falling away first.

   Now concerning it take these propositions:--

   1. That apostasy is any defection from him to whom we owe and have
   performed subjection, or a falling from that lord to whom we owe
   fealty. I am sure, in religious matters, it importeth a defection from
   our right and proper Lord. Thus the devil is an apostate, because he
   abode not in his first estate: Jude 6, And the angels which kept not
   their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in
   everlasting chains,' &c.; abode not in the truth;' John viii. 44, Ye
   are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.
   He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth;' that
   is, forsook his obedience to God, and so became the ringleader of all
   rebellious creatures. So it is true of our first parents. They were
   apostates, they did revolt from God and their obedience to him.
   Therefore it is said, Rom. v. 19, By one man's disobedience many were
   made sinners.' So of their posterity; their apostasy is described by
   turning back from following the Lord,' Zeph. i. 6, and departing from
   God,' that is, his worship and service; Isa. lix. 13, In transgressing
   and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our God.' Let us
   then be agreed of this notion of apostasy, which is evident, that it is
   a falling off from the obedience which we owe to our rightful Lord.

   2. The apostasy mentioned in the text was not civil, the falling away
   of many kingdoms from the Roman empire; but an apostasy of the visible
   church from him who is Lord of the church. I prove it partly from the
   persons to whom the apostle wrote, who did not intermingle themselves
   with state affairs, or were not concerned in the interests of the Roman
   empire further than that they lived within the bounds of it; and this
   apostasy must be understood as they would conceive of apostasy with
   respect to the main cause wherein they were concerned and engaged,
   which was the profession of Christianity. Partly from the use of the
   word in the Christian doctrine; falling away there is certainly falling
   away from the faith and purity of the gospel: Luke viii. 13, Which for
   a while believe and in time of temptation fall away.' And partly
   because to them it was expressly foretold that ti'nes aposte`sontai,
   Some shall fall away or depart from the faith,' 1 Tim. iv. 1. Lastly,
   because those who are most concerned to maintain the notion of the
   civil apostasy from the Roman empire are most notorious in this
   defection. It is true the Roman empire lost Asia and the places
   adjacent by the invasion of Eastern nations, but it was thrust out of
   Rome by the rebellion of its subjects, and chiefly by the influence of
   the Pope there, as histories manifest. So that this interpretation will
   not help them a jot, but hurt them not a little. So that here is a
   defection from our proper Lord, and a spiritual defection, not a civil.

   3. The proper Lord of the Christian church is Jesus Christ, who hath
   purchased it with his blood, and died, and rose again, and revived,
   that he might be Lord of dead and living,' Rom. xiv. 9; and again, Eph.
   v. 23, Christ is the head of the church, and the Saviour of the body.'
   He that saveth and recovereth the church out of the general apostasy of
   mankind, and restoreth them to their due obedience and proper
   happiness, he only is fit to be head of the church; and this only is
   Christ: we expect no opposition here.

   4. The apostasy from the Lord will be determined chiefly by these two
   things;--(1.) By undermining his authority; (2.) Or destroying the
   interests of his kingdom. By these two we may understand the falling
   away, which is to come first.

   [1.] By undermining his authority. Certainly his authority is under
   mined when others presume to usurp his place without his leave.
   Therefore, to superinduce a universal head of the visible church, which
   Christ never appointed, is manifestly to usurp his authority; though
   the party so intruding should pretend to hold his sovereignty from
   Christ, and under him, yet this is treason against Christ, for here is
   an authority set up without, and therefore against, his consent. Put
   the case in a temporal kingdom, and the thing will be clear. And thus
   the Pope is the usurping head of a rebellion against Christ. Where did
   Christ institute him to take this office? Tu es Petrus is such a stale
   pretence, so often baffled and defeated, and pretended upon so small
   grounds;--as that Christ hereby conveyed singular authority to Peter
   above the rest of the disciples, that from Peter it descendeth to his
   successors, and to those of Rome (if ever he were at Rome), and not
   those of Antioch;--that it is endless to pursue the absurdities of this
   impertinent allegation. The argument holdeth the more strongly when the
   Pope condemneth all the churches that will not be his subjects, how
   holy, good, and obedient to the laws of Christ soever they be. Surely,
   if anything, this is an apostasy or a revolt from our rightful Lord;
   and to consent to this rebellion and usurpation is to be drawn into a
   conspiracy against Christ, to submit to the head of the most pernicious
   schism that did ever rend the church of Christ, and to betray the
   liberty of the people of oar Lord to a tyrannical usurpation.

   [2.] Or corrupting and destroying the interests of his kingdom.
   Certainly, wherever there is a degeneration from the purity and
   simplicity of the gospel, the interests or Christ's kingdom are
   destroyed. I fear,' saith the apostle, 2 Cor. xi. 3, lest by any means,
   as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should
   be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.' The ancient, pure,
   apostolic Christianity doth only preserve the interests of Christ's
   kingdom in the world; there is no way of safety but by keeping there;
   for since godliness is a mystery, and we shall see afterwards the
   iniquity that is contrary is a mystery also--2 Thes. ii. 7, The mystery
   of iniquity doth already work'--we need to be exactly careful to keep
   close to the doctrine, worship, and discipline of the first gospel
   church; for if these had remained pure, Antichrist had never risen.
   Christ's institutions would have preserved his interests in the world;
   but as these were corrupted, the apostasy prevailed. When the faith of
   the gospel was turned into dead opinions and curious questions, if not
   direct errors, and the worship of the gospel was corrupted by giving
   divine honour to saints and angels, and turned into a theatrical pomp
   and the pageantry of empty ceremonies, which eclipse the majesty and
   splendour of it; and the discipline of the church into a temporal
   domination, and all is carried in the world by sides and interests,
   that Christianity looketh like another thing, a design calculated for
   the present world rather than a serious preparation for the world to
   come; then certainly there is an apostasy and a defection from Christ;
   how ever the corrupt manners of the church be varnished over with the
   name of Christianity, there is a degeneration questionless; and that is
   apostasy, in a mystery, such as this is, though not in open revolt from
   Christ.

   But to make this more evident to you, let us consider what the kingdom
   of Christ is. The gospel kingdom is a kingdom of light, life, and love.
   Opposite to light is ignorance and error; to life, a religion that
   consists of shows, dead rites, and empty ceremonies; to love,
   uncharitableness, malice, and especially hatred of the power of
   godliness. Now where these prevail eminently, there is an opposite
   kingdom set up to the kingdom of Christ; certainly a falling off from
   his kingdom: that is to say, where, in opposition to light, error is
   taught, and ignorance is counted the mother of devotion, and people are
   restrained from the means of knowledge, as if the height of Christian
   faith and obedience did consist in an implicit believing what the
   church believeth; and where, instead of life, men place their whole
   religion in superficial rites and ceremonies, and some trifling acts of
   seeming devotion and exterior mortifications; and instead of love to
   God and souls, all things are sacrificed to private ambition; and
   forcing consciences with the highest penalties and persecutions to
   submit to their corruptions--there is a manifest subversion of the
   interests of Christ's kingdom. In short, God's witnesses were slain in
   that city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, and where our
   Lord was crucified,' Rev. xi. 8; that city which answereth to Sodom for
   impurity, to Egypt for idolatry, and to Jerusalem for persecution of
   the saints; there may you find the great apostasy.

   5. This apostasy from our Lord's authority and the interests of his
   kingdom is some notable and discernible apostasy, and the head patron
   thereof is Antichrist. The defection is not of one, or a few, or many
   in divers churches; there have always been backsliders from the faith:
   1 John ii. 19, They went out from us, but they were not of us;' and the
   spirit of Antichrist wrought in the apostles' days: 1 John ii. 18, As
   you have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many
   Antichrists;' and again, 1 John iv. 3, we are told of the spirit of
   Antichrist: And this is that spirit of Antichrist, whereof you have
   heard that it should come, and even now already is it in the world;'
   then described to be afterwards (ver. 5) a worldly spirit: They are of
   the world, and speak of the world, and the world heareth them.' Though
   they profess Christianity, carnal, worldly hypocrites, which never
   conquered the fleshly mind and interest, have the spirit of Antichrist;
   these obscure the light, and obstruct the life and love of the
   gospel--they that wholly affect a life of pomp and ease in the church.
   Now, this hath always been in all the ages. The false Christians forget
   their hopes are built upon a crucified Christ, and are to be derived to
   them from a glorified Christ in the other world--crucified in this
   world and glorified in the next,--which indeed are the two
   considerations that keep Christianity pure and lively; that all was
   purchased by a crucified Christ, and all is dispensed by a glorified
   Christ; and I wish you would oftener think of it. But the great
   apostasy is eminently found in some external visible church, where
   these corruptions are generally received and defended. For the head of
   that church is Antichrist, where doctrine is corrupted, and the worship
   mingled with idolatry, and the government a usurpation, and bent
   against the holy seed that desire to worship God in spirit and in
   truth; there is this manifest revolt from and rebellion against God and
   Christ, though they push with the horns of the lamb.

   That the Papists are a corrupt sect of Christians is beyond dispute to
   any that will try their religion by the scriptures; and that they are
   far more corrupt than the Protestants or Reformed Churches, will also
   soon appear by the comparison, or a view of both churches. But whether
   they are so corrupt as to become the seat of Antichrist, is the matter
   under debate. Therefore, let any one consider where the eminent
   apostasy is to be found. Who are they that invade Christ's authority by
   setting up a universal head over all Christians? Who are they that
   establish the doctrine of demons, or revive the worship of a middle
   sort of powers between God and mortal men? 1 Tim. iv. 1. Who through
   hypocrisy invent so many lies to maintain it, and when Christians
   should keep themselves from idols, 1 John v. 21, yet, in defiance of
   this, worship angels and other creatures: Col. ii. 18, Let no man
   beguile you of your reward, in a voluntary humility, and worshipping of
   angels,' &c.; and erect the images of saints, commanding and compelling
   men to adore them, and pray to them? Who are they that are not
   contented with the one only Mediator: 1 Tim. ii. 5, For there is one
   God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ;' 1
   Cor. viii. 5, For though there be that are called gods, whether in
   heaven or in earth (as there be gods many, and lords many), but to us
   there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in
   him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
   him,'--but set up other mediators of intercession? Who are they that
   plead for indulgences and the supererogatory satisfactions of the
   saints, as gathered into the treasury of the church, and so profitable
   for the remission of sins, and condemn them who think the contrary? Who
   are they that keep believers from reading the scriptures, when they are
   so expressly enjoined to do it? John v. 89, and Ps. i. 2, But his
   delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day
   and night.' That deny one part of the Lord's Supper to his disciples,
   notwithstanding his institution to the contrary? 1 Cor. xi. 25, 26,
   After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying,
   This is the New Testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink
   it, in remembrance of me; for as oft as ye eat this bread, and drink
   this cup, ye do show forth the Lord's death till he come.' It were
   endless to instance in all: I shall speak more of it in the following
   verses.

   6. This apostasy is not only forbidden, but foretold as a thing that
   would certainly come to pass. This consideration is necessary for
   divers reasons.

   [1.] Because the Papists ask how this can be consistent with Christ's
   care of his church, that there should be a universal apostasy and decay
   of Christian religion, who hath promised the gates of hell shall not
   prevail against it'?

   Ans. That promise is made chiefly to the invisible church, or community
   of the elect, not to all the visible societies of the Christians,
   against whom the devil can and hath prevailed, and doth daily, to the
   destruction of many souls. And we say not that the whole visible church
   did apostatise, though all are faulty.

   [2.] Because some require the time when this apostasy began to be
   particularly assigned and noted to them, and by what persons these
   corruptions were first introduced, or else deny that any such thing
   hath been. But the case is clear: it began to work betimes, only it
   wrought in a mystery. But cannot we prove a man to be old, unless we
   prove the first moment when his grey hairs began to appear, or his
   natural force to be abated? Who can tell every step of the progress of
   the corruption of the Jewish church? and why should the like be
   required of the Christian? This dunghill of corruption was not raised
   in one age: and suppose that in track of time authors be forgotten,
   matters of faith are not to be contradicted because of the defect of
   history. And yet histories are not altogether wanting in the case, only
   in things that came in by degrees they are not necessary. In the
   introducing of the general apostasy, some erred in the simplicity of
   their hearts, as the people followed Absalom, 2 Sam. xv. 11. But shall
   we deny a thing to be done because we cannot speak the particular
   moments of time, and circumstances of them, when and how it was done?
   Shall we say the pointer in the dial passeth riot, because we do not
   see its motion? Might not the priests judge of a leprosy, though they
   knew not how it was contracted? Iniquity mystical did by degrees
   prevail.

   [3.] Because some think, if we should grant such an apostasy, it would
   interrupt the whole course of visible Christianity, and so deprive the
   world of a ministry and ordinances, till Christ send some new nuncios
   from heaven, or by miracle, at least, authorise a new ministry, that
   may be owned by the world, and received by his people. A vain conceit!
   for though this apostasy is foretold that it should come to pass, yet
   it is also foretold that Christ will be with the apostles and their
   successors to the end of the world, Mat. xxviii. 20; and prayed for all
   them that should believe in him through their word, John xvii. 20; and
   though the church was corrupted by degrees, yet all this while it
   ceased not to be a church, nor the officers thereof to be Christ's
   ministers. When the ten tribes fell away, yet God till their
   dissolution continued the spirit of prophecy amongst them; and in the
   Christian church a ministry, though many had their calling from such
   who consented to the encroachments of Antichrist. God had not so wholly
   cast off his people, but that there was a ministry and ordinances;
   their ministry was a true ministry, and the baptism a true baptism, to
   be owned in foro externo: for these things remain whilst anything of
   Christianity remaineth. In a body mangled with wounds, or all overgrown
   with sores, there is life remaining; and so some functions and offices
   of life. God called idolatrous Israel his people, and was not angry
   with them for circumcising their children, but for offering them to
   Moloch, Ezek. xvi. 20, 21. But of this in the next verse, where
   Antichrist is said to sit in the church of God.

   II. The revelation of Antichrist: and that man of sin shall be
   revealed, the son of perdition; where two things are notable:--(1.) His
   rise and appearing; (2.) The names and titles given to him.

   1. His rise and appearing, expressed in the word revealed; that is,
   that great and chief Antichrist, upon that apostasy or falling away,
   shall be extant and show himself to the world. A thing is said to be
   revealed two ways--either when it is in being, or when it is
   discovered; both ways are proper here. He shall publicly appear,
   exercising a tyranny in the world, or cast off his veil, and show
   himself in his colours. God by his providence permitteth him to be, and
   by the doctrine of the gospel discovereth his impostures to all those
   who have no mind to be deceived.

   2. The names or titles given to him; they are two:--(1.) The man of
   sin,' wherein he is compared and likened to Antiochus; (2.) The son of
   perdition,' wherein he is compared and likened to Judas.

   [1.] For the first, the Jews called Antiochus the man of sin:' 1 Macch.
   ii. 48, They gave not the power to the sinner;' in the Greek, to`
   ke'ras amartolo. They gave riot the horn to the sinner.' The Syriac
   version hath it, They suffered not the horn of the sinner to be lifted
   up;' and ver. 62, Fear not the words of the man of sin,'--apo` lo'gon
   andro`s amartolou me` phobethete, From the words of the man the sinner
   be not afraid Now why did they call Antiochus the man of sin? Because
   he sought to alter the religion of the people, and by cruelty to
   introduce a change of worship and idolatry, and such laws as he would
   set up. Now, according to this pattern, Antichrist is a man of sin;
   that is, either a man given up to all sin eminently, a sinner addicted
   unto sin, and a ringleader of others unto sin, either by fraud and
   violence; or as he giveth encouragements and encitements to sin; or as
   a special kind of sinner, a usurper and invader of the empire of the
   Son of God. So was Antiochus. So was Antichrist. Now, how much open sin
   is practised, allowed, and maintained in the Papacy, I list not now to
   rake into; their own stories speak enough;--the sodomy, blasphemy,
   incest, adulteries, sorceries, murders, treasons, parricides, which
   they have authorised and countenanced. Histories witness that hardly
   hath the world yielded a more abominable sort of men, than have sat in
   that chair of pestilence. This I am sure of, that a man can sin nowhere
   at so cheap a rate as in Popery, where, what by dividing their sins
   into mortal and venial, and these expiated by a little penance,
   accompanied with a single attrition, and bare grief and trouble,
   because of the punishment; what by faculties, pardons, licenses,
   dispensations, indulgences, sin is distinguished out of the conscience.

   But because he is called the man of sin, here it cometh fitly to be
   inquired whether Antichrist be an individual person? for that man of
   sin' would seem to be some single person. No; he is put for a society
   and succession of men, that make up the head of the apostate state. As
   one lion figured the whole kingdom of the Babylonians, and one bear the
   kingdom of the Medes and Persians, and one leopard the kingdom of the
   Grecians, Dan. vii.,--and there the fourth beast is the fourth
   kingdom,--so one person that succession of men that head the revolters
   from Christ. So Dan. viii., a goat figured a succession of kings; so
   the Assyrian, Isa. x. 5, several kings in that empire; so Isa. xiv. 9,
   the king of Babylon, meaning not one but many. So this man of sin doth
   not note a single man, but a succession of men, a body politic or
   corporate, under one opposite head to the kingdom of Christ: so the man
   of God' is put for all faithful ministers, 2 Tim. iii. 17; so honour
   the king,' 1 Peter ii. 17, series regum. So o archiereu`s, Heb. ix. 25,
   The high priest every year entereth into the holy place;' meaning not
   one, but the succession of the order; and in reason it must needs be so
   here. Because Antichrist, from his beginning to his end, from his rise
   and revelation, till his ruin and destruction, will take up such a long
   track of time, as cannot fall within the age of any one man, even from
   the time of the apostles till the end of the world. Antichrist is the
   head of the apostasy; for here the apostasy and the revelation of the
   man of sin are conjunct; now the mysterious apostasy could not be
   perfected in a short time.

   [2.] The son of perdition, wherein he is likened to Judas: John xvii.
   12, None of them is lost but the son of perdition.' Him he resembleth
   in covetousness, treachery, and final destruction. The term may be
   explained either passively, or actively:--(1.) Passively, as one
   condemned to everlasting destruction; as the son of death,' is one
   condemned to die: 2 Sam. xii. 5, He shall be a son of death;' we
   translate it, He shall surely die.' So children of wrath,' Eph. ii. 3;
   so here, son of perdition.' (2.) Actively, bringing destruction upon
   himself and others; one that shall destroy others, and so he is called
   Abaddon,' and Apollyon,' Rev. ix. 11, and is opposite to Christ, who is
   the author of salvation.' Heb. v. 9, but Antichrist of destruction. And
   let us see the parallel between him and Judas; for the person is a
   type, as well as the name hath a significancy. Antichrist then is like
   Judas--in profession, a disciple of Christ; in office, a governor of
   the church; but in practice, a traitor. As they said of the blind man,
   John ix. 9, Some said, This is he; others, He is very like him.' The
   Pope boasteth that his seat is apostolical, his chair is Peter's chair,
   and that he is the successor of the apostle. Grant it, but there is an
   error of the person--not of Peter, but of Judas. Let us see the
   parallel:--

   (1.) Judas was not a stranger, but a pretended friend and apostle: Acts
   i. 17, He was numbered with us, and obtained part of this ministry.'
   Turks and infidels are enemies to Christ, but Antichrist seeketh to
   undermine him, under a pretence of friendship; anti'christos is one in
   show for, and in effect against Christ, and the beast in the Revelation
   is said to push with the horns of the lamb.' Rev. xiii. 11. If he were
   a professed enemy, what mystery were there in it? But mystery was
   written upon the woman's forehead, Rev. xvii. 5; and here, ver. 7, The
   mystery of iniquity.' It is wisdom to discern the false prophet, Rev.
   xiii. 18, but there needeth no great wisdom to discover an open and
   professed adversary.

   (2.) He sold Christ for a small matter. Omnia Romae venalia: pardons,
   indulgences, freedom from purgatory, all to be bought with money; and
   it is a small matter, considering the things put to sale, the pardon of
   sins, the souls of men redeemed with Christ's precious blood. The
   antichristian state maketh a market of religion; truth is made to yield
   to interest and profit.

   (3.) Judas betrayed Christ with a kiss, under a pretence of honouring
   him: Luke xxii. 48, Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son
   of man with a kiss?' Antichrist is a true adversary of Christ, though
   he pretend to adore him; as those that murdered the present prophets
   would by all means beautify the tombs of the prophets deceased, and
   bear a respect to their memories, Mat. xxiii. 30. He pretendeth to be
   his servant, yea, a servant of servants, but is really his enemy. The
   apostle telleth us of some that were enemies to the cross of Christ,'
   Phil. iii. 18. Who to appearance such friends to the cross as the
   rabble of nominal Christians? but they are opposers of his spiritual
   kingdom, the virtue and power of the cross. You have crucifixes every
   where, painted, carved, gilded; they are ready to worship the cross
   with a holy worship; they set it in their temples, altars, wear it in
   their bosoms, and wherever they meet it show it reverence, adorn it
   with gold, silver, and precious stones. Their popes and prelates have
   it carried before them; and are not these friends of the cross? No;
   they live a worldly, sensual life, and all their religion tendeth there
   unto; therefore enemies of the cross of Christ, because they mind
   earthly things. This is right antichrist-like, to betray Christ under a
   colour of adoration.

   (4.) Judas was a guide to them that came to take Christ; and one main
   work of Antichrist is to be a ringleader in persecuting for religion.
   Christ is in heaven, death hath no more power over him; his natural
   body is above abuse, but his mystical body still suffereth: Acts ix. 6,
   Why persecutest thou me?' Antichrist is the head of the persecuting
   state, others are his emissaries and agents, to take Christ in his
   members. It is a politic religion, that must be carried on with worldly
   artifices, with power and cruelty.

   J5.) Lastly, The covetousness of Judas is set forth. He was a thief,
   one that carried the bag, John xii. 6. England, to its bitter cost,
   knoweth the polling exactions of the Papacy; all its dealings with us
   were to fill the bag out of this puteus inexhaustus. Now all these
   things should open our eyes; we may behold the man of sin, the son of
   perdition; one egg is not more like to another than Judas and
   Antichrist.

   Use. Is to persuade us to a detestation of what is antichristian, and
   to that end let us mark the progress of the text. (1.) The apostasy
   made was for Antichrist; (2.) Antichrist, rising upon the apostasy,
   becometh a man of sin; and (3.) The man of sin is also the son of
   perdition.

   1. Let me begin first with the falling away. There is a twofold falling
   away--either from the power and practice of godliness, or from a true
   religion to a false, particularly to Popery.

   [1.] I begin with the falling away from the power and practice of
   godliness, though the profession be not changed; and the rather, partly
   because this disposeth to the entertainment of error. When a people
   that are carried with great fervour and vigour of zeal for a while,
   lose their affections to good, and return to a worldly, sensual life,
   then the bias of their hearts doth easily prevail against the light of
   their understandings. And so unsanctified men may the sooner be drawn
   to apostasy; they never felt the quickening virtue of faith, and were
   never wrought by it to the true love of God, or an holy and heavenly
   mind and life. And partly, also, because if a lively Christianity had
   been kept up, Antichrist had never risen in the world; and it is the
   way to keep him out still: When the servants slept, the enemy sowed
   tares.' Mat. xiii. A sleepy religion and corruption of manners made way
   for corruption of doctrine, worship, and order. It was with the church
   according to the spouse's complaint: I sleep, but my heart waketh.'
   Cant. v. 2. Some care there was, but much drowsiness and deadness in
   religion; and that produced the great apostasy. Partly too, because
   there is such a compliance between the nature of antichristianism and
   the temper of a carnal heart; for superstition and profaneness grow
   both upon the same root. A lothness to displease the flesh, the sensual
   nature of man, is such, that it is loth to be crossed; and that
   breedeth profaneness. For wherefore do men ingulf themselves in all
   manner of sensualities, but because they are loth to deny their natural
   appetites and desires, and row against the stream of flesh and blood,
   but will walk in the way of their own heart, and in the sight of their
   own eyes'? Eccles. xi. 9. Again, if nature be to be crossed, it is only
   a little; it shall only be in some external actions, and observances,
   and dead rudiments, which never kill our lusts, nor promote the divine
   life. And this pleasing superstition shall make up a religion which is
   a fit pillow for a carnal heart to sleep upon. Popery is the easiest
   religion for the flesh that can be found out, for it never biteth nor
   disturbeth their lusts. The duties of it are like the pharisees'
   fasting, which our Lord compareth to old wine, Mat. ix. 17, fit for
   old, dried skin bottles. Well, take heed of falling away from a lively
   godliness. No man entereth seriously upon religion but with some
   tasting or rejoicing, Heb. vi.; now as this decayeth, we fall off. The
   heavenly life is obstructed, if not choked and quite lost. Now, to
   prevent this, observe two things:--(1.) Your coldness in duties; (2.)
   Your boldness in sinning.

   (1.) Coldness in duties, when the will and affections grow more
   remiss^and the worship of God, which keepeth up the remembrance of mm,
   is either omitted or performed perfunctorily, and in a careless and
   stupid manner: Jer. ii. 32, My people have forgotten me days without
   number;' Job xxvii. 10, Will he always call upon God? will he delight
   himself in the Almighty?' God chargeth Israel with growing weary of
   him; and it began in not calling upon him, Isa. xliii. 22. Now, when
   you seldom think or speak of God, and do not keep up a delightful
   communion with him, there is a falling away.

   (2.) Boldness in sinning. When men lose their tenderness and
   strictness, and the awe of God is lessened in their hearts, and they do
   not only sin freely in thought, but freely in act, have not that hatred
   of sin and watchfulness as formerly, but more abandon themselves to a
   carnal life, they are falling off from God apace: 2 Peter ii. 20, For
   if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the
   knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again
   entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than
   the beginning.' At first the heart checked you for sin, but you did not
   kindly come off, were not troubled about it, hoped God would pardon it;
   and then you are bold to venture again, and so by degrees are entangled
   in the sensual and worldly life. Now consider the causes of it:--I.
   Want of faith in God: Heb. iii. 12, Take heed, brethren, lest there be
   in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living
   God.' You have not a sound belief of his being and presence. 2. Want of
   love to God: Rev. ii. 4, 5, Nevertheless I have (some what) against
   thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember, therefore, from
   whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy first works; or else I
   will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of its
   place, except thou repent.' Your hearts decline from that love you had
   to him and his ways, and then your work is intermitted. 3. Want of a
   due sense of the world to come: Heb. x. 39, But we are not of them who
   draw back to perdition, but of them that believe, to the saving of the
   soul.' 4. The love of the present world: 2 Tim. iv. 10, For Demas hath
   forsaken me, having loved this present world.' The more that is valued,
   the more your hearts are taken off from things to come, and the care
   about them; you have too great a liking, either to the profits of the
   world--1 Tim. vi. 10, The love of money is the root of all evil, which
   while some have coveted after, they have erred from the faith'--or else
   the pleasures of the world: 2 Tim. iii. 4, Lovers of pleasure more than
   lovers of God.' As the inclination of the heart groweth stronger to
   sensual pleasures, your thoughts of God are less serious and pleasing
   to you. Now look to these things, lest you grow quite weary of God and
   the holy life, which once you had an affection unto.

   [2.] From a true religion to a false; which may be done two ways:--(1.)
   Out of corruption of mind; (2.) Out of vile affection.

   (1.) Out of weakness of mind, as those do that were never well grounded
   in the truth: Eph. iv. 14, That we henceforth be no more children,
   tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by
   the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
   deceive;' 2 Peter iii. 16, In which are some things hard to be
   understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable, wrest, as they
   do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.' Therefore we
   need to be established; but the forsaking of a truth we were bred in
   usually cometh from some falseness of heart. Some errors are so
   contrary to the new nature, that they discern them by the unction: 1
   John ii. 20, But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all
   things.'

   (2.) Out of vile affection, when they forsake the truth for the
   advantages of a fleshly, worldly life, some places to be gotten by it,
   &c., and as the whore of Babylon hath a golden cup, riches, and
   preferments, wherewith it inviteth its proselytes. Now these are worse
   than the former, for they sell the birthright: Heb. xii. 16, Lest there
   be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of
   meat sold his birthright.' O Christians! take heed to yourselves.
   Apostasy brought Antichrist into the church. Let it not jure
   postliminio, bring him back again into the land, or into your hearts.

   2. The next step is the man of sin. As the first apostasy of Adam and
   Eve brought sin into the world, so this great apostasy brought in a
   deluge of sin into the church, and defiled the holy society which
   Christ had gathered out of the world. Idolatry is often called adultery
   or fornication; spiritual uncleanness disposeth to bodily, and bodily
   to spiritual. Usually a corrupt state of religion and corrupt manners
   go together; otherwise the dance and the fiddle would not suit. The
   world cannot lie quiet in a course of sin, if there be not some
   libertine, atheistical doctrine, and carnal worship to countenance it:
   Rev. xi. 10, And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over
   them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because
   these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.'

   3. The man of sin is also the son of perdition--(1.) Actively. False
   religions strangely efferate the mind: Jude 11, These go in the way of
   Cain;' and Hosea v. 2, Revolters are profound to make slaughter.' Men
   think no cruelty nor dishonesty unlawful which serveth to promote the
   interests of their sect, and lose all charity to those that are not of
   their way. (2.) Passively, shall be destroyed. Sometimes grievous
   judgments come in this world for the corruptions of religion; but in
   the world to come, dreadful is the end of apostates: 2 Peter ii. 20,
   21, For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through
   the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again
   entangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than
   the beginning; for it had been better for them not to have known the
   way of righteousness, than after they had known it, to turn from the
   holy commandment delivered unto them.'

SERMON IV.

   Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or is
   worshipped; so that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God, showing
   himself that he is God.--2 Thes. II. 4.

   IN this matter of Antichrist we have made this progress--First, That he
   arose upon, and by a falling away from, the ancient pure state of
   Christianity. Secondly, That the Holy Ghost points him out by his names
   and titles, which are two:--the man of sin,' wherein he is resembled to
   Antiochus; and the son of perdition,' wherein he is resembled to Judas.
   As Antiochus, he is one that by force and power should change the laws
   and ordinances, and compel men to his abominations. As Judas, he should
   betray Christ by a kiss for worldly gain, and be one that is in
   pretence an apostle, but indeed a real adversary to Christ. Now, after
   the apostle had pointed at him by his names and titles, he describeth
   him by his practices, wherein his names and titles are verified; for
   here he proveth that he should be as Antiochus, by his exalting himself
   above all that is called God, which is said of Antiochus, Dan. xi. 36,
   And the king shall do according to his will, and he shall exalt and
   magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things
   against the God of gods;'--and as Judas, one sitting in the temple of
   God; that is, he sitteth there as exercising a public ecclesiastical
   office, yea, challenging the highest seat in it. He sitteth there
   potestate regiminis, by the power of his government; he doth
   Cathedratica potestate praesidere (Estius). His sitting there as chief
   shows him as Judas; his sitting here as God, and exalting himself above
   all that is called God, showeth him Antiochus.

   But to handle the words more closely, Antichrist is here set forth:--

   I. As opposite to Christ; o antikei'menos, one set to the contrary,
   that is, in respect of pride chiefly. Christ was the pattern of
   humility, Antichrist is the king of pride; Christ would not so much as
   assume to himself an authority to divide the inheritance between two
   brethren--Luke xii. 14, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over
   you?'--but Antichrist will depose kings, and dispose of kingdoms.

   II. The instances of his pride:--(1.) In exalting himself above all
   human power: Who exalteth himself above all that is called God, or is
   worshipped.' (2.) A usurpation of divine honour: He, as God, sitteth in
   the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.'

   Let us open these things more particularly:--

   I. He is represented in the term antikei'menos as one diametrically
   opposite to Christ, and contrary to him, who is the true head and Lord
   of the church: Acts x. 36, He is Lord over all;' but Antichrist
   opposeth himself, that is, showeth himself in a quite contrary
   appearance. That which is most remarkable in Christ, and should be in
   all his followers, is humility. He expressed a wonderful contempt of
   the riches and greatness of the world, and all the honour which is of
   man; taking the form of a servant, and making himself of no reputation,
   and living a mean, inferior life. He came not to be ministered unto,
   but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many,' Mat. xx. 28.
   He kept no state, nor affected pomp of attendants; though he were Lord
   of all, yet he became poor, to make us rich,' 2 Cor. viii. 9. But it
   may be this was proper to him; doth he expect it from his servants and
   officers in the church? Yes; this is the grace which he hath
   recommended to all his followers: Mat. xi. 29, Learn of me, for I am
   meek and lowly.' But especially to the ministers of the gospel: our
   Lord foresaw what spirit would work in them, and therefore he
   forewarned them of pride and lordliness: Mat. xx. 25, 26, Ye know that
   the princes of the earth do exercise dominion over them, and they that
   are great exercise authority upon them; but it shall not be so among
   you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister.'
   Among Christ's servants, he that is chief must be chief in service,
   even as a servant unto all: Luke xxii. 26, He that is chief, as he that
   doth serve.' Domination, greatness, principality and power, is allowed
   in the civil state, for there it is necessary; yet it is excluded the
   church. This affecting of pre-eminence and chiefness is the bane of the
   church--it is taxed as a great sin in Diotrephes, 3 John 9--be it
   either over their fellow-labourers, or the people of the Lord. You see
   how tender the apostles were in this point; everywhere they disclaim
   this affectation of lordship: 2 Cor. i. 24, Not that we are lords of
   your faith, but helpers of your joy.' And Peter recommendeth it to his
   fellow-elders: 1 Peter v. 3, Neither as being lords over God's
   heritage, but being examples to the flock.' And if the apostles would
   not assume lordship, who may? It is true, there is a government in the
   church, and the people are to obey their guides, Heb. xiii. 17, and to
   have them highly in honour, for their works' sake,' 1 Thes. v. 13; but
   yet the pastors of the church should govern by light and love, not by
   pomp and force, and not be known by such pomp and authority as begets
   fear. Well, now, let us see the opposite state. If humility and
   meekness be in the very essence of Christianity, and woven throughout
   the whole frame of it, then it is antichristian to be lordly and proud,
   especially in them who pretend to be successors of Christ and his
   apostles. Now, in the Pope and his adherents, you will see the most
   odious pride set forth that ever the world was conscious unto, without
   any cloak and shame. And all their business is to get power; what
   designs they have for preferment in the world, how studiously they
   have, and do prosecute it, they blush not to own openly before angels
   or men. This worldly ambition to rise higher and higher is their design
   and trade of life. As the bishop of Rome, at first, from the chief
   pastor of that city, affected to be an archbishop over the suburban
   towns and cities; then, a patriarch over many cities; and because two
   opposed him in Italy a long time, Ravenna and Milan, he gets power over
   them, and then he must be oecumenical bishop over all the world. But
   Constantinople resisteth for a long time, yea, arrogateth within the
   empire the same titles. Who more earnest against it than Gregory, whom
   they call the Great, and more forward to charge the assuming of this
   title as antichristian? But then, when once they began, by powerful
   means and many indirect courses, to be owned as universal bishop, they^
   enlarged their bounds, not only over the ecclesiastical power, but
   civil, and all kings and princes must stoop to them, as well as
   bishops. So that here was the progress and gradation:--First, from the
   chief presbyter, a bishop over many presbyters in the same city; then,
   a metropolitan over many bishops in one province; then, a patriarch
   over many provinces in one diocese (for in the Roman division there
   were seven provinces in one diocese); then, universal bishop in the
   whole world; then, the only shepherd and bishop, and others but his
   substitutes. Pretty steps of ambitious encroaching! But yet exalting
   himself farther, he challengeth all power in heaven and earth; and the
   like is practised by his followers at this day in the church of Rome.
   From private priests they grow up into some prelature, as archdeacons,
   deans; then a bishopric; then a better or richer; then archbishops,
   cardinals; then pope. And the devil is grown so impudent, by the help
   of these churchmen, as that it is counted a great piece of spiritual
   wisdom, publicly owned in the world, to be able, by these steps, to get
   higher and higher, and lord it over God's heritage; as if ambitious
   affectation were the honour of Christianity, and gospel humility would
   expose the church to scorn, and pomp and grandeur were a greater
   ornament to religion than grace; when, in the mean time, they have
   nothing to prove them to be true pastors of the church but Judas's
   kiss, a little owning of Christ to countenance their ambition.

   II. The particular instances wherein the pride of Antichrist is set
   forth are two:--

   1. His exalting himself above all human powers: He opposeth and
   exalteth himself above all that is called God, or is worshipped.' Here
   the object is set forth by two terms:--(1.) All that is called God;
   (2.) Or worshipped. They both belong to the same thing.

   [1.] That which is called God, that is, magistrates, princes, and
   kings: Ps. lxxxii. 1, He judgeth among the gods;' and ver. 6, I have
   said, Ye are gods; all of you are children of the Most High;' and John
   x. 34, 35, It is written in your law, I said ye are gods. If he call
   them gods unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be
   broken,' &c. God hath clothed magistrates with his own honour so far
   that he hath put his name upon them; and their eminency is a part of
   his image, as it lieth in superiority, dominion, and power. Though
   magistrates be but like their brethren as to their common nature, yet
   in respect of their office they have the glorious title of gods
   conferred upon them; as being his vicegerents, and bearing his person
   in government, they are honoured with his name. So that, without
   impeachment of blasphemy, those that excel in the civil power may be
   called gods. Now, over these Antichrist exalteth himself, that is,
   above all kings and potentates.

   [2.] The other notion is, e` se'basma; we render it, or is worshipped.'
   The Greek word is, whatever is held in the highest degree of reverence,
   whatever is august or illustrious; as the emperors of Rome were called
   Sebastoi`: Acts xxv. 21, Paul appealed to be referred to the hearing of
   Augustus;' it is tou Sebastou, not Augustus Caesar, who was then dead,
   but his successor. Well, then, here is the character of Antichrist:
   that he exalteth himself above all civil authority authorised and
   permitted of God, not only above ordinary magistrates, but kings and
   emperors. Now, we find in history no less than twenty kings and
   emperors trampled under foot by the Pope of Rome, some of whom he had
   excommunicated and deposed from their kingdoms, and their people
   dispensed withal in denial of their subjection to them; others brought
   to cruel, shameful deaths, and their kingdoms miserably rent and torn,
   to the destruction of millions of men, by their means. He that hath any
   knowledge of the histories in Christendom cannot but know these things;
   how he treadeth on their necks, kicketh off their crowns with his feet,
   and hath brought them to the vilest submissions. And if kings and
   emperors have received more spirit and courage, and the Popes of Rome
   learned more modesty nowadays, thanks is due to the light of the
   gospel, which hath shined so far and to such a degree as to the
   consuming of Antichrist, though not to his utter destruction.

   2. The next instance of his pride is his usurpation of divine honour,
   expressed in two clauses:--(1.) The one showeth the usurpation itself,
   That he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God;' (2.) The other, the
   degree of it, showing himself as God.' Both must be explained and
   vindicated.

   [1.] For the usurpation itself, he sitteth as God in the temple of
   God.' By the temple of God is meant the church: 1 Cor. iii. 16, 17,
   Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God
   dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God
   destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.' So 2 Cor.
   vi. 16, What agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are
   the temple of the living God.' The external visible church, which
   professeth the faith of Christ and beareth his name; so that the place
   wherein Antichrist shall arise is the visible Christian church; not
   Rome ethnic, but Christian.

   But is, then, the church of Rome the church of Christ?

   Ans. It was one part of it before it was perverted; it usurpeth still
   that name; it retaineth some relic of a church, mangled as it is. Saith
   Calvin in his Epistles: I think I have given some strong reasons that
   it yet retaineth some show of a church.' Now in this temple of God he
   sitteth as an officer and bishop there, as I before explained it: and
   whereas other princes are said to reign so many years, the Pope is said
   to sit so long. It is his sedes, his cathedral or seat. And again, here
   he is said to sit as God, that is, as God incarnate, for Christ is the
   true and proper Lord of the church; none should reign there but he. And
   the name of this man of sin is not Antitheos, but anti'christos; not
   one that directly invadeth the properties of the supreme God, but of
   God incarnate, or Christ as Mediator: he sitteth negatively, not as a
   minister, but positively as supreme lord upon earth, whom all must
   adore and worship, and kings and princes kiss his feet. In short, he
   usurpeth the authority due to Christ. Now I shall prove that by a
   double argument:--

   First, By usurping the titles due to Christ; for he that will make bold
   with names will make bold with things; as to be sponsus ecclesiae, the
   husband of the church, as Innocent called the church sponsam suam, his
   spouse; caput ecclesiae, the head of the church, which is proper to the
   Saviour of the body; supreme, visible, and universal head, which only
   Christ is, who hath promised to be with her to the end of the world,
   and will be visible to those who do at length approach his court in
   heaven, where his seat is; to be chief pastor, Christ's own title: And
   when the chief shepherd shall appear,' 1 Peter v. 4; to be pontifex
   maximus, the greatest high priest, whereas Christ alone is called the
   high priest of our profession,' Heb. iii. 1, and the great high priest
   over the house of God,' Heb. iv. 14; so his vicar-general upon earth;
   whereas the ancient church attributed this to the Holy Ghost, calling
   it Vicariam vim Spiritus Sancti, he supplies his room and absence. Now
   titles including power, certainly they are not to be usurped without
   warrant. Therefore to call the Pope the chief and only shepherd, and
   the like, it is to usurp his authority to whom these things originally
   belong.

   Secondly, He doth usurp the thing implied by the titles--the authority
   over the church, which is only due to God incarnate. Supreme authority
   may be considered, either as to the claim, right, property, and
   pre-eminence which belong to it, or to the exercise.

   1. The claim and right pretended. He sitteth as God in the temple of
   God; that is, by virtue of his office there, claimeth the same power
   that Christ had, which is fourfold:--

   (1.) An unlimited power over all things both in heaven and earth. This
   was given to Christ, Mat. xxviii. 18, and the Pope, as his vicar,
   challengeth it. But where is the plea and ground of the claim? For one
   to set up himself as a vice-god without warrant, is rebellion against
   Christ. To set himself in his throne without his leave, surely none is
   fit to have this authority that hath not his power to back and to
   administer and govern all things for the church's good, which power God
   would trust in the hands of no creature.

   (2.) A universal headship and supremacy over all the churches of
   Christ. Now, this supreme power over all Christians is the right of God
   incarnate, and whosoever challengeth it sits as God in the temple of
   God; and it is very derogatory to the comfort of the faithful that they
   should in all things depend upon one man as their supreme pastor, or
   else be excluded from the hope of salvation. Certainly this power, as
   to matter of fact, is impossible to be managed by any man, considering
   the vast extent of the world, and the variety of governments and
   different interests under which the people of God find shelter and
   protection, and the multitude and diversity of those things which are
   comprised in such a government; and, as to matter of right, it is
   sacrilegious, for Christ never instituted any such universal vicar and
   bishop. It is a dignity too high for any creature: none is fit to be
   universal head of the church but one that is God as well as man.

   (3.) Absolute authority, so as to be above control. When a mortal man
   should pretend to be so absolute as to give no account of his actions,
   that it shall not be lawful to be said to him, What^doest thou? and all
   his decrees must be received without examination or complaint, this is
   such a sovereignty as belongs to none but God: Job ix. 12, Behold, he
   taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest
   thou?' Now, this is in their canon law, that the Pope is to be judged
   by no man; that though he should lead millions of souls into hell, none
   can say Domine, cur ita facis?

   (4.) Infallibility and freedom from error, which is the property of
   God: he neither is deceived nor can deceive. Let God be true, and every
   man a liar.' Now, that corrupt and fallible man should arrogate this to
   himself, such an unerring in judgment, is to usurp divine honour in
   matter of right and in matter of fact. For the Pope to arrogate this is
   as great a contradiction to all sense and reason as if a man sick of
   the plague, or any other mortal disease, should say that he was
   immortal, and in that part wherein the disease was seated.

   2. As to the exercise, there are two acts of supreme authority:--

   (1.) Legislation.

   (2.) Judgment.

   (1.) Legislation: It is the peculiar and incommunicable property of
   Christ to be Lord and lawgiver to the church; Isa. xxxiii. 22, The Lord
   is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; he will
   save us.' God alone hath such interest in his people as to prescribe
   supreme or universal laws to them, and we are his subjects: James iv.
   12, There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.' Now,
   whosoever will make laws that shall immediately bind the conscience,
   they invade Christ's sovereignty. This is spiritual tyranny, and the
   worst sort of tyranny, to arrogate a power over the subjects of Christ
   and their consciences as lord of their faith. He that taketh upon him
   to rescind and make void his institutions and ordinances, and set his
   own in their place, and give that reverence and honour to them which
   only belongeth to the ordinances of Christ, he is Antichrist, whatever
   he be.

   (2.) As to judgment: It is an exercising an authority no less than
   divine, so to take upon him to absolve man from his duty to God, or the
   penalty which sin hath made his due. The one is done by dispensations,
   the other by indulgences: and therefore whoever by dispensations
   antiquates and dispenses with the laws of God himself is thus guilty;
   as dispensing with marrying the brother's wife. Nay, one of the Popes
   dispensed with one that took his own sister to wife. I do not allege
   this so much for the particular facts, but to show the power which they
   challenged to be inherent in themselves. Bellarmine saith, Christ hath
   given Peter and his successors a power faciendi peccatum non
   peccatum--to make a sin to be no sin; and again, If the Pope, should
   err in forbidding virtues and commanding vices, the church were bound
   to believe vices to be good and virtues to be evil,' which certainly is
   to set man in the place of God. As to indulgences: as to pretend to
   give pardons for sin for so many years, a thing that God himself never
   did; to pardon the sin before it was committed, that is, to give a
   license to sin: so for the highest crimes to absolve men, upon a little
   attrition or trouble about the sin,--to do all this and more than this
   as of right, is to sit in the church of God as God.'

   [2.] And showing himself that he is God: that is meant, not of what he
   professeth in words, but what he doth in deed. It is not said that he
   saith he is God, but apodeiknu'nta, he showeth himself, or sets forth
   himself as God. The reason of the thing showeth it:--(1.) Antichrist
   gets power by seduction, or the deceiveableness of unrighteousness;
   therefore does not openly call himself the true and only God. He is
   represented as a false prophet, that speaketh lies in hypocrisy. If one
   would openly and plainly profess himself to be God, he might be a
   frantic usurper, but could not be a cunning seducer, and few would be
   so stupid and senseless as to be led by him. (2.) Antichrist, whoever
   he be, is to be a Christian by profession, and to have a high and great
   charge among the visible professors of Christianity. He is a secret
   adversary, that groweth upon the apostasy or degeneration of the
   Christian state. Now, such pretends observance and obedience to Christ,
   and therefore he would not openly declare himself to be God, and he
   sitteth in the temple and church of God, as before. And it is a
   mystery; all which imply crafty conveyance, and that he doth not openly
   assume the godhead, but slily and secretly, which doth not mend the
   matter; for the insinuating, devouring, unsuspected enemy is the most
   perilous and pernicious; as Joab to Amasa, and Judas to Christ. (3.)
   Antichrist is plainly a man. Now, for a man to disannul all religion,
   and set up himself directly as God, is improbable. Nero,
   Nebuchadnezzar, Simon Magus would be adored as gods; they did not deny
   other gods, nor a greater God above them; therefore it is the arrogance
   of works is intended. If Antichrist will show himself as God, certainly
   he will sweeten his blasphemy with some hypocrisy, as that he is the
   vicar and vicegerent of God. (4.) His showing himself as God, is either
   accepting or doing such things, which if they did rightly belong to
   him, they would show that he is God. Two persons I find in scripture
   charged for usurping divine honours. The one, Herod Agrippa, who was
   smitten by an angel for not giving God the glory, when the people
   cried, The voice of God, and not of man,' Acts xii. 22: his fault was
   accepting what was ascribed by others. The other is the prince of Tyre:
   Ezek. xxviii. 2, Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said I
   am God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seat; yet thou
   art a man, and not God, though thou set thy heart as the heart of God.'
   His fault was taking upon him, as if he were God, to accept divine
   honours, to do those things which would make him equalise himself to
   our Lord Christ, blessed for ever. So doth he show himself that he is
   God. (1.) His accepting Antichrist's disciples, who call him our Lord
   God the Pope, supremum numen in terris, a certain deity upon earth.
   That the Pope hath the same consistory with God, and the same tribunal
   with Christ; that he is lord of heaven and earth; that from him there
   are no appeals to be made, no, not to God himself; that the Pope may do
   all that God doth; that he is the husband of the church, and the
   foundation of faith (Council of Lateran, sess. 4); Alter Deus in terra;
   that the words of the Pope in cathedra are for certainty of truth equal
   to the scriptures; that he can change the form of sacraments delivered
   by Christ, or decree contrary to scripture. If any do object that these
   were the applauses of his flatterers and claw-backs, it is true they
   were so uttered; but those flatteries of the canonists and Jesuits do
   come to be received doctrines among them; and whereas divers popes have
   directed special commissions for perusal of the works of the learned,
   with authority to expunge and purge out whatsoever is not orthodox,
   many better things have come under censure, but these things stand
   still, as being very pleasing to his holiness's humility, and so not to
   be altered: besides, many of these things have been spoken to his face
   without rebuke.--Conc. Latt., sess. 2. He is called the high priest and
   king that is to be adored by all, and most like unto God--(sess. 9). It
   is said, the aspect of thy divine majesty dazzleth our eyes, and that
   of the 72d Psalm applieth to him, All the kings of the earth shall
   worship him, and all nations shall serve him.' Now, to accept and
   approve of these flatterers is to show himself that he is God: (2.) By
   doing such things as if he were God, not by the usurpation of the
   formal name, as by arrogating to himself such things as belong to God,
   his right and property, to take upon himself to be lord of consciences,
   to command what faith is to be believed, suppressing the true doctrine
   of Christ, and setting up his own inventions, dispensing with God's
   laws, taking upon him to pardon sins. One article for which Luther was
   condemned is this: that it is not in the power of the church or Pope to
   make new articles of faith; another, that the best penitence of all is
   the new life. Qui facit Deos divosque Deo major est. The Pope doth
   canonise saints, and his decrees must be received as oracles, &c.

   The first use is to give us a clear discovery where to find Antichrist;
   every tittle of this is fulfilled in the bishop of Rome, that we need
   no longer be in doubt, and say, Is this he that should come, or shall
   we look for another?' Who is the antikei'menos, but he that opposeth
   himself to that humble state and frame wherein Christ left the church,
   and will be prince of all pastors, and swear them to his obedience, and
   hath made such troubles in the world to make himself acknowledged for
   head and chief? Who is he that exalteth himself above all that is
   called God, and is august in the world, but he that takes upon him to
   deprive and depose emperors, kings, and princes, by his
   excommunications, suspensions, interdictions, and decrees, discharging
   subjects of their allegiance and oaths, and giving away their kingdoms;
   that doth crown and uncrown emperors with his feet, and tread upon them
   as one would do upon a viper? Who is he that sitteth as God in the
   temple of God--that is, affecteth the honour due to our Lord Jesus
   Christ--but he that doth thus imperiously aspire, subesse Romano
   Pontifici definimus esse de necessitate salutis; that takes upon him a
   power to make a new creed, and say we are bound to obey him; that saith
   he can change the things which God hath commanded in his word, and
   dispense with them, and so by his decrees make the commandment of God
   of none effect; and can forgive sins, not only already committed, but
   to be committed, which God himself never would do; that lords it over
   consciences, enslaving the world to his usurpations: in short, that
   will be obeyed in those things which God hath forbidden, and take upon
   himself an office which no human creature is capable of? Who is he that
   showeth himself that he is God, but he that suffereth himself to be
   decked with the spoils of God's own attributes; to be optimum maximum,
   the best and chiefest, our Lord God the Pope, a visible deity; and will
   be adored by all the potentates of the earth, with such veneration as
   greater could not be given to Christ himself if he were corporally
   present, and will have all the world to submit to his decrees as being
   infallible; that challengeth a power over angels, purgatory, and hell?
   These things are as clear as daylight, and ought to be regarded by us,
   partly that we may bless God, who hath freed us from this tyranny, and
   have a liberty of judging of truth and falsehood out his holy and
   blessed word; partly that we may stand fast in this liberty. Those that
   were never pope-bitten know not the mischiefs that attend this
   spiritual tyranny; and God grant that we never more know it to our
   bitter cost. Therefore, as Samuel dealt with the Israelites when they
   would cast off the theocracy, or God's government, under which they had
   been well and safely governed, unless they forfeited the protection by
   their own sin, that they might be like all the nations round about
   them, 1 Sam. viii. 20;--Samuel telleth them what would be the manner of
   the king that should reign over them: 1 Sam. viii. 11-13, And he said,
   This shall be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will
   take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to
   be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. And he will
   appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and
   will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make
   his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. And he will
   take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be
   bakers. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
   oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants,'
   &c.;--so if such a wanton humour should possess us, that we must have
   the religion of the nations round about us, consider whom you receive
   spiritually to reign over you--the king of pride, who opposeth and
   exalteth himself above all that is called God, or is worshipped, &c.,
   one that will not only devour your substance, but lord it over your
   consciences, and put out the eye of your reason, that you may the
   better swallow his damnable errors, pestilent superstitions, and
   idolatries, and bold usurpation on the authority of Christ; or else
   burn your bodies with temporal fire, and cast out your name as one to
   be condemned to that which is eternal. It is easy to open the
   flood-gate, but when that is done, it is not so easy to call back the
   waters; and when you come to discern the difference between the blessed
   yoke of Christ and the iron yoke of Antichrist, it will be too late for
   a remedy to repent of your error.

   The second use is to show us how things should be carried in the true
   and reformed Christianity.

   1. With such meekness, modesty, and mortification, that our religion
   may be known to be established by a crucified Lord, whose doctrine and
   example do visibly and eminently hold forth the contempt of the world.
   The pride and ambition of the pastors of the church hath been the cause
   of all the evil in it; therefore nothing so unsuitable to the gospel as
   a domineering spirit. We, that are to preach heavenly-mindedness and
   self-denial, should not affect the greatness of the world, lest our
   lives contradict our doctrine.

   2. How eminent and exemplary we should be in our obedience to
   magistrates, for this is to be opposite to the antichristian estate.
   God is very tender of the honour of civil powers and authorities, and
   will have every soul to be subject to them: Rom. xiii. 1, Let every
   soul be subject unto the higher powers, for there is no power but of
   God; the powers that be are ordained of God;' and again, 1 Peter ii.
   13, Submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be
   to the king as supreme, or to governors, as them that are sent by him.'
   Great respect and submission is due to them for God's sake, and that we
   may commend religion to the profane world, and live down the reproaches
   of the gospel. They were branded as wicked men that were not afraid to
   speak evil of dignities, that despise governments in their own hearts,
   or weaken the esteem of it in the hearts of others by their speeches: 2
   Peter ii. 10, But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
   uncleanliness, and despise government; presumptuous are they,
   self-willed; they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.'

   3. What a wickedness it is to usurp divine honours! We do so when we
   take that praise and admiration to ourselves which is only due to God:
   Acts iii. 12, And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye
   men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on
   us, as though by our power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
   The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers,
   hath glorified his Son Jesus, &c.; and his name, through faith in his
   name, hath made this man strong, whom we see and know; yea, the faith
   which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence
   of you all.'

SERMON V.

   Remember ye not, that, while I was with you. I told you these things?
   and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his
   time; for the mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now
   letteth will let till he be taken out of the way.--2 Thes. II. 5-7.

   IN these words is:--

   First, A digression, calling them to remembrance of what he delivered
   by word of mouth,

   Secondly, A progress in the further description of Antichrist. He had
   hitherto been described by--

   1. His names and titles;

   2. His nature and properties; now--

   3. By the time of his appearing, where take notice of three things:--

   I. That Antichrist was not then revealed, because there was an
   impediment hindering his revelation.

   II. That though he was not then revealed, yet that mystery of iniquity
   did begin to work, but secretly.

   III. That when that impediment shall be removed, then Antichrist shall
   be revealed.

   First, I begin with his putting them in mind of what he had told them
   before by word of mouth: Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with
   you, I told you these things?' This showeth the certainty and
   usefulness of this doctrine; for though the event were not to be
   accomplished in their days, yet he taught them before when present, and
   now repeateth it again when absent; he preached it in private, and now
   writeth it for public good, and laboureth to confirm the truth of it,
   and fasten it upon their memories.

   Observe, then, that the doctrine of Antichrist is a profitable
   doctrine, and a point very necessary to be preached and known.

   1. It is a point very necessary to admonish and warn the faithful, that
   they be not circumvented with these delusions, and be found in the
   opposite state to Christ Jesus, and the interests of his kingdom. God
   hath blown his trumpet: Rev. xviii. 4, Come out of her, my people, that
   ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
   plagues;' God calleth his people out of spiritual Babylon; it is
   dangerous and unsafe being there. If we would escape Babylon's
   punishments we must escape her sins, not live in that communion and
   society where there are such temptations to idolatry and other
   detestable enormities. It is disputable whether the errors of Popery be
   damnable, or there be any possibility of salvation in that religion.
   Some deny all possibility; others, abating from the rigour of that
   opinion, assert a very great difficulty: 1 Cor. iii. 13, Saved as by
   fire;' if so much Christianity left as to save them, it is with much
   ado. But the question is not about our benefit, but our duty; not
   whether possibly we may be saved? but what is the way the Lord will
   have us to walk in? And if there were possibility or probability of
   salvation in the way, in the general, yet there is very little or none
   for them that live in a known sin, and especially in a sin of such a
   dangerous nature as abetting an opposite faction to Christ, such as is
   that of Antichrist.

   2. It is necessary to fortify and forewarn the people of God against a
   double temptation. (1.) Against scandal; (2.) Against persecutions.

   [1.] Against scandal. It is a dangerous temptation to atheism to see
   Christianity so corrupted and debauched by a vile submission to serve
   worldly ends, and turned into the pageantry of empty and ridiculous
   ceremonies, which beget scorn and contempt of it in the minds of all
   considering beholders; and therefore there are more atheists in Rome
   and Italy than in other countries. Supernatural things, disguised with
   a vain pomp, lose their reverence, and do not alarm the conscience, but
   harden the heart in a settled atheism and contempt of Christ. Now it is
   a mighty stay to the heart to see that this degeneration was foreseen
   and foretold: John xvi. 1, These things have I spoken to you, that you
   should not be offended;' Mat. xviii. 7, Woe unto the world because of
   offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man
   by whom the offence cometh!'

   [2.] Against persecutions; for the man of sin is also a son of
   perdition, a destroyer of the saints, and maketh havoc of the people of
   God. Now it is grievous when Christians suffer by Christians, and we
   may have many doubtings and misgivings about our cause; but when
   Antichrist is clearly discovered, we submit the more cheerfully to
   suffer the hardest things under his tyranny; for suffering under
   antichristian persecution is martyrdom and suffering for Christ, as
   much as suffering under Pagan persecution: Rev. xiv. 13, And I heard a
   voice from heaven saying unto me, write, Blessed are the dead which die
   in the Lord from henceforth,' &c. Not only the primitive martyrs, who
   were put to death by heathens, but those that are condemned by
   Christians and burned for heretics, those are martyrs also.

   3. That we may the better understand true Christianity; antikei'mena
   paralleleime'na ma'lista phai'netai, opposites illustrate each other.
   The two opposite states are Christianity and Antichristianity; the one
   is a mystery of godliness,' 1 Tim. iii. 16; the other, a mystery of
   iniquity.' The design of the mystery of godliness is to recover men
   from the devil, the world, and the flesh, unto God; the other, to
   seduce men from God to the devil, the world, and the flesh again; and
   that by corrupting the former mystery, or the most excellent
   institution that ever the world was acquainted with for the ennobling
   and refining man's nature; so that Christ's religion is turned against
   himself, to lull men's consciences asleep, whilst they gratify the
   lusts of the eyes, the lusts of the flesh, or live in pride of life.
   The devil is gratified by all sin, but especially he is eidolochare`s,
   as Synesius calleth him; one that delighteth in idols, as knowing this
   is the best way to make men brutish, or to live in an oblivion or
   neglect of God; for an idol is a teacher of lies,' Hab. ii. 18, doth
   imprint upon the mind carnal and false conceptions of a deity.

   4. To confirm us in the truth of the Christian faith, when we see the
   prophecies of it expressly fulfilled; for this is the Lord's direction
   to know a true prophet, Deut. xviii. 22, if the thing come to pass, and
   the event doth punctually answer the prediction; but when a prophet
   speaketh in the name of the Lord, and the thing follow not, nor come to
   pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken. Now, the
   apostles did not only teach the church the doctrine of Christianity,
   but by a prophetic spirit and divine revelation foretold things to
   come; and among these, the great thing which is to happen and come to
   pass before Christ's second coining is Antichrist, or the appearing of
   the man of sin. Therefore, that we may not doubt of what is past, nor
   suspect what is further to come, it is good to study these prophecies,
   and know they are to be fulfilled in their time, that we may say that
   God, who hath kept touch with the world hitherto in all the predictions
   of the word, will not fail at last.

   Use 1. To reprove them that think this is a curious point not to be
   searched into. Why then did God reveal it, and that so often by St
   Paul, by St John, in so many prophetical representations of it? Surely
   it is not curiosity to search into things revealed, but to intrude
   ourselves into things hidden, and which God hath put under a veil of
   secrecy. It is true men must know their measure, and not attempt to run
   before they can go, and venture upon obscure points before well versed
   in plain; and it is true, in more abstruse points, men must not rashly
   define, but soberly and modestly inquire, and compare predictions with
   plain events; this is no way culpable.

   2. To reprove those that are so impatient of giving a little attendance
   to such doctrines for a while, and think at least matter more
   profitable should be insisted on; they are persuaded enough already. It
   is well if it be so; but those that stand should take heed lest they
   fall; and presumptuous confidence soonest giveth out, and forsaketh
   Christ. I would but propound this argument to them: If it were
   profitable for them that were to go out of the body long before
   Antichrist was revealed to be taught these things again and again, and
   they be charged to keep these things in remembrance, certainly it is
   more profitable for others that live at the time when these things are
   in being, and the temptation is at the next door, ready to break in
   upon them. Surely it is profitable to discover Antichrist, to reduce
   those that are gone astray, much more to prevent a revolt, that we may
   not return to this bondage after a deliverance from it.

   Secondly, I come to consider the time of his appearing, and there to
   observe three things:--

   I. That Antichrist was not then revealed because there was an
   impediment hindering his revelation: 'and now ye know what withholdeth
   that he might be revealed in his time,' that is, what keeps him back
   for the present, until the time that God had prefixed. The apostle doth
   not expressly mention what this to` kate'chon or impeachment [1] was,
   either because he thought it enough to appeal to their memory and
   knowledge--now ye know what withholdeth; there was no need of repeating
   that which was formerly mentioned, they sufficiently knew; or partly
   because he would not give the heathen an occasion of raising a
   persecution against the Christians, if they should come to understand
   that one professing himself a Christian should erect a throne for
   himself at Rome, and that the empire should be taken away to make way
   for him. The Romans were very jealous, o'ti basilei'an
   onoma'zomen--because they talked of these innocent notions, the kingdom
   of Christ and the kingdom of heaven; they were apt to accuse them
   laesae majestatis, as if they would with open force and violence attack
   or assault the empire; therefore the apostle had spoken that which he
   thought not fit to write in an epistle; or, lastly, he leaveth it in
   this obscurity because all prophecies were but darkly uttered, that
   their accomplishment be not hindered, since it is the will of God that
   such events shall fall out in the world, and out of indulgence to his
   people he is pleased to foretell this. It is not meet that the
   prediction should either be too clear or too dark; if too clear, the
   event would not follow, nor God's government of the world be carried in
   such a way as might suit with the liberty of mankind; if too dark, the
   comfort and caution of God's people would not be sufficiently provided
   for.

   But what was this impediment? The ancients generally determined it to
   be the Roman empire; for so Tertullian--the empire of Rome, which was
   to be divided into ten kingdoms; and reason showeth it, because the man
   of sin could not rise to his greatness as long as the Roman empire
   stood. Why? Because he that was to exalt himself above all that is
   called God, and above all that is august, could not bring his designs
   to pass as long as the Roman empire retained its majesty; but when once
   that was eclipsed and removed, then he was to be revealed in his time:
   all things have their time, and so the man of sin. Well, then, it was
   the Roman empire that stayed the manifestation of Antichrist, he being
   to build his tyranny on the ruins and wreck thereof; and therefore the
   primitive Christians prayed pro mora finis, that it would please God to
   defer the fall of this empire, fearing worse things upon the
   dissolution thereof.

   Now this impediment showeth both the time and place of Antichrist; and
   time and place, next to the nature and state of things, are the best
   circumstances to discover him. (1.) The place: Antichrist's seat and
   throne was to be there, where the seat of the Roman empire was; and St
   John telleth us it was situated on the city that had seven hills: Rev.
   xvii. 9, The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman
   sitteth;' and that is Rome, which is famously taken notice of to be
   seated on seven hills or mountains. Now Antichrist had not room as long
   as the seat was filled with the Roman emperor, for ^this seat could not
   be filled with two imperial powers at once, especially with such a
   tyrannical power as that of Antichrist is, exalting itself not only
   above kings and kingdoms, but pan se'basma, the august state of the
   emperors themselves; there was no exalting this chair, till there was a
   removal of the throne; while the Roman emperor possessed Rome, the seat
   was full, and till it was void it could riot be the seat of Antichrist.

   (2.) The next circumstance is the time when the impediment is taken
   away, when the Roman empire is so weakened and removed from Rome that
   this power may grow up; and that was when the Roman empire was divided
   into ten kingdoms, as Tertullian saith, and is agree able enough with
   the prophecy of St John, Rev. xvii. 12, And the ten horns which thou
   sawest are ten kings, which have not received their kingdoms as yet,
   but receive power as kings one hour with the beast;' that is, near that
   time when the Roman empire was broken and divided, which began near 600
   years after Christ's birth.

   II. The next observation is, that though he was not revealed in the
   apostle's days, yet the mystery of iniquity did begin to work, but
   secretly; for it is said, ver. 7, beginning, The mystery of iniquity
   doth already work.' This is given as a reason why it would break out
   sooner; but it was kept back; there was something a-brewing that would
   make way for Antichrist, some disposition of the matter, some
   propensity thereunto, something begun, which would afterwards show
   itself more eminently in the great Antichrist.

   Here two things must be explained:--

   1. What is the mystery of iniquity.

   2. How it began to work in the apostle's days.

   1. What is the mystery of iniquity? I answer--The design of usurping
   Christ's kingdom, and his dignities and prerogatives over the church,
   to countenance the kingdom of sin and darkness, under the mask of piety
   and religion. Surely it is something quite contrary to the gospel,
   which is the mystery of godliness,' 1 Tim. iii. 16. So that this
   mystery is such a course and state design as doth frustrate the true
   end and purpose of the gospel, and yet carried on under a pretence of
   advancing and promoting it. So that to state it we must consider:--

   [1.] The mystery of godliness.

   [2.] The mystery of ungodliness or iniquity.

   [1.] The mystery of godliness is known by the ends of God in the
   gospel, and the way he took to promote those ends.

   (1.) The end of the gospel is to recover man out of a carnal, ungodly
   state, into a state of holiness and reconciliation with God. (1.) The
   terminus a quo:--men are carnal, tin godly. (1st.) Carnal. When man
   fell from God, he fell to himself; self interposed as the next heir,
   and that self was not the soul, but the flesh. Many wrong their souls,
   but no man ever yet hated his own flesh; and therefore men would rule
   themselves, and please themselves according to their fleshly appetite
   and fancy: John iii. 6, That which is born of the flesh is flesh,' and
   therefore love the pleasures, honours, and profits of the world, as the
   necessary provision to satisfy the desires of the flesh; and whosoever
   live thus they live in a carnal state, as all do, till grace renew
   them, Rom. viii 5. But this carnal estate doth break forth and bewray
   itself in various ways of sinning: Titus iii. 3, For we ourselves also
   were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and
   pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.'
   All are not fornicators, drunkards, persecutors, nor live in the same
   way of sinning; but all are turned from God to the world, and have a
   carnal mind, which is enmity to God.' Rom. viii. 7. (2dly.) The next
   word is ungodly. Men thus constituted live either in a denial of God:
   Ps. xiv. 1, The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God'--or a
   neglect of God: Eph. ii. 12, Without God in the world;' without any
   acknowledgment or worship of him: Ps. ix. 17, The wicked shall be
   turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God;'--or if not
   deprived of all sense of a deity, they worship false gods, as those,
   Acts xiv. 12, 13, the men of Lycaonia, that called Barnabas, Jupiter,
   and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker, and would have
   sacrificed to them; and the apostle saith to the Galatians, Gal. iv. 8,
   When ye knew not God, ye did service to them which by nature are no
   gods;' they worshipped plurality of false gods; and though the wise men
   of the Gentiles had some confused knowledge of the true God, Rom. i.
   19-21, yet they glorified him not as God, but committed idolatry by
   setting up a false medium of worship, an idol, which begot a brutish
   conception of God in their mind; so that a false religion is so far
   from showing a remedy of corrupt nature that it is a great part of the
   disease itself. (2.) The terminus ad quem, into a state of holiness and
   reconciliation with God, in whom man alone can be happy. (1st.) For
   holiness and obedience to God. The great design of the Christian
   religion is to bring us back to God again. First, As we are carnal, by
   the denial of fleshly and worldly lusts: Titus ii. 12, The grace of God
   that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that,
   denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,' &c.; 1 Peter ii. 11, Dearly
   beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshy
   lusts that war against the soul;' and Gal. v. 24, They that are
   Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.'
   Secondly, As we are ungodly, to bring us to the knowledge, love,
   worship, and obedience of the true God: Acts xiv. 15, We pray ye that
   you should turn from these vanities to the living God, that hath made
   heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things therein;' and to seek
   after the Lord, from whom we have life, breath, and all things, Acts
   xvii. 25-28; 1 Thes. i. 9, How ye turned from idols to serve the living
   and true God.' (2dly.) Reconciliation with God, that we might have
   commerce with him for the present, and live for ever with him
   hereafter: 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
   himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed
   unto us the word of reconciliation;' 1 Peter i. 18, Ye are not redeemed
   with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
   conversation,' &c.; Heb. vii. 25, He is able to save unto the uttermost
   all that come unto God through him;' that whereas before they were
   alienated from the life of God, they might live in his love, and in the
   expectation of being admitted into his blessed presence, that they may
   see him as he is, and be like him, 1 John iii. 2.

   (2.) The way it took to obtain these ends, how God may be satisfied,
   man renewed and changed, God pacified by the sacrifice, merit, and
   intercession of Christ Jesus, who came in our flesh and nature, not
   only to acquaint us with the will of God and the unseen things of
   another world, but to suffer an accursed death for our sins; therefore
   the mystery of godliness is chiefly seen in God manifested in our
   flesh,' 1 Tim. iii. 16; and man must be renewed and changed, for our
   misery showeth what is needful to our remedy and recovery: that we be
   not only pardoned but sanctified, if ever we will be saved and
   glorified; for till men have new and holy hearts they can never see
   God: Heb. xii. 14, Without holiness it is impossible to see God.' Mat.
   v. 8, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,' &c.; nor
   for the present love him and delight in him, nor take him for their
   chief happiness. As none but Christ can satisfy justice and reconcile
   such a rebel to God, so none but Christ's Spirit can sanctify and renew
   our souls that we may live in obedience to him: 1 Cor. vi. 11, Such
   were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
   justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.'
   This is the mystery of godliness.

   [2.] Now, for the mystery of ungodliness or iniquity: that is a quite
   opposite state, but carried on plausibly, and with seeming respect to
   the mystery which it opposeth. To know it, take these considerations:--

   (1.) Where the carnal life is had in request and honour, there
   certainly is the mystery of iniquity to be found, whatever pretences be
   put upon it. Now, the carnal life is there had in request and
   honour,--(1.) Where all is referred to worldly gain and profit, and the
   whole frame of the religion tendeth that way; for certainly they are
   enemies to the cross of Christ whose god is their belly, and who mind
   earthly things,' Phil. iii. 19. Now pardons, indulgences, purgatory,
   shrines of saints, what do they all tend unto but to make a merchandise
   of religion? It was an old byword, Omnia Romae venalia--all things may
   be bought at Rome, even heaven and God himself, &c. And these things
   are used, not only to open the people's mouths in prayer, but their
   hands in oblations and offerings. The complexion of their religion is
   but a gainful trade. But the papal exactions and traffickings have been
   so much and so loudly insisted upon, and the evil runneth out into so
   many branches, that I shall forbear. (2.) Where temporal greatness is
   looked upon as the main prop of their religion. The king's daughter is
   glorious within,' rich in gifts and graces, Ps. xlv. 13; Ps. xciii. 5,
   Holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, for ever;' but the false church is
   known by pomp and external splendour. It is easy to discern the true
   ministers of Christ from the false; the true are known by being much in
   labours, much in afflictions: 2 Cor. vi. 4-6, In all things approving
   ourselves the ministers of God, in much patience, afflictions,
   necessities, distresses, in labours and watchings, and fastings; by
   pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy
   Ghost, by love unfeigned,' &c.; whereas the false ministers are known
   by the life of pomp and ease. The rule is plain, because self-denial is
   one of the great lessons of Christianity, and self-seeking the bane of
   it: therefore where men professedly seek the greatness of the world,
   they serve not the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own bellies.

   (2.) Where men are turned from God to idols, though it be not the
   demons of the Gentiles, but saints, as mediators of intercession, there
   godliness is destroyed and the mystery of iniquity set up; for the
   great drift of the Christian religion is to bring us to God, through
   Christ. So the great whore--(which imports a breach of the fundamental
   article of the covenant, Thou shalt have no other gods but me), it is
   said, Rev. xvii. 5, Upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery,
   Babylon, the mother of fornications and abominations upon
   earth,'--debaucheth nations with her idolatry, and so seduceth from God
   to the worship of the creature, that the great intent of the gospel is
   lost.

   (3.) Wherever power is usurped in Christ's name, and carried on under
   the pretence of his authority, to the oppressing of Christ's sincere
   worshippers, who hate the carnal life, and would by all means keep
   themselves from idols, or bowing and worshipping before images, but
   excel in unquestionable duties, there is the mystery of iniquity; for
   the beast, that hath a mouth like a dragon, pusheth with the horns of a
   lamb, Rev. xiii. 11. The violence and persecution against the sincere,
   pure worshippers of Christ is nothing else but the mystery of iniquity,
   the enmity of the carnal seed against the holy seed, or the seed of the
   serpent against the seed of the woman disguised.

   (4.) Where there is a lessening of the merits of Christ and his
   satisfaction, as if it were not sufficient for the expiation of sin
   without penal satisfactions of our own, there is the mystery of
   iniquity: For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
   sanctified.' Heb. x. 14.

   (5.) Where the new nature is little thought of, and all religion is
   made to consist in some external rites and adorations or indifferences,
   there the reducing of man to God is much hindered, and Christianity is
   adulterated, and the religion that designedly countenanceth these
   things is but the mystery of iniquity--To worship God, as the Papists
   do, with images, agnus dei's, crucifixes, crossings, spittle, oil,
   candles, holy water, kissing the pix, dropping beads, praying to the
   Virgin Mary and other saints, repeating over the name Jesus five times
   in a breath, repeating such and such sentences so often, praying to God
   in an unknown tongue, and saying to him they know not what, adoring the
   consecrated bread as no bread, but the very flesh of Christ himself,
   fasting by feasting upon fish instead of flesh, choosing a tutelary
   saint whose name they will invocate, offering sacrifices for quick and
   dead, praying for souls in purgatory, purchasing indulgences for their
   deliverance, carrying the bones and other relics of saints, going in
   pilgrimage to shrines or images, or offering before them, with a
   multitude more of such trashy devotions, whereby they greatly dishonour
   God and obstruct the motions of the heavenly life, yea, quite kill it;
   for instead of the power and life of grace, there are introduced
   beggarly rudiments or ritual observances in indifferent things, and
   vain traditions by which Christian liberty is restrained, and these
   pressed with as much severity as unquestionable duties established by
   God's known law for the renewing and reforming mankind. We are to stand
   fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and not to be
   entangled again with the yoke of bondage.' Gal. v. 1; Col. ii. 16, Let
   no man judge you in meat or drink, or in respect of an holiday, or of
   the new moons, or of a sabbath-day.' These things are left to
   arbitrament, to abstain or use them for edification. That physician may
   be borne with who doth only burden the sick with some needless
   prescriptions, if faithful in other things; but if he should tire out
   the patient with prescriptions which are not only altogether needless,
   but troublesome, costly, and nauseous, and doth extinguish and choke
   true religion by thousands of things indifferent, making our bondage
   worse than the Jews', this is the mystery of iniquity,--to cheat us of
   the power of godliness by the show of it, burdening of men with
   unnecessary observances.

   2. How did this work in the apostle's time? Something there was then
   which did give an advantage to Antichrist, and laid the foundation of
   his kingdom, and did dispose men's minds to an apostasy from pure
   Christianity; as--

   [1.] Partly the idolising of pastors by an excess of reverence, such as
   was prejudicial to the interests of the gospel, setting them up as
   heads of factions: 1 Cor. i. 12, Now this I say, that every one of you
   saith, I am of Paul, and I am of Apollos, and I of Cephas;' 1 Cor. iii.
   22, Glory not in men, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas,' &c. This in
   time bred tyranny and slavery in the church.

   [2.] The ambition of the pastors themselves, and the spirit of
   contention for rule and precedency: Acts xx. 29, 30, There shall arise
   among you ravening wolves, speaking perverse things, to draw disciples
   after them;' which within a little time began to affect not only a
   primacy of order, but of jurisdiction and authority; so that then
   Antichrist did not exist in his proper person, but in spirit and
   predecessors.

   [3.] The errors then set afoot corrupted the simplicity of the gospel:
   1 John ii. 18, Now there are many antichrists;' 1 John iv. 3, Every
   spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is
   not of God; and this is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard
   it should come, and even now already is it in the world.' The spirit of
   Antichrist is even now in the world; there was a spirit then working in
   the church to introduce this mystery of iniquity, only the seat was not
   empty, but filled by another; the seeds of this mystery were sown in
   ambition, avarice, haughtiness of teachers, and their carnal and
   corrupt doctrines.

   [4.] Some kept their Jewish, others their Gentile customs, so that the
   Christian religion was secretly tainted and mingled with the seeds of
   heathenism and Judaism, which afterwards produced the great apostasy.
   Paul, in all his epistles, complaineth of the Judaising brethren, and
   seeks to reduce them to the simplicity of the gospel. In the
   Corinthians he complaineth of their resort to idol temples, their
   communion in idol-worship: 1 Cor. x. 14, Wherefore, my dearly be loved,
   flee from idolatry;' and ver. 20, But I say, that the things which the
   Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to God, and I would
   not that ye should have fellowship with devils,' and 2 Cor. vi. 16. The
   worship of angels, interdiction of certain meats, then will-worship,
   and shows of humility: Col. ii. 16, Let no man judge you in meat and
   drink, or in respect of an holiday, or of the new moon, or of the
   sabbath-days;' and ver. 18, Let no man beguile you of your reward in a
   voluntary humility, and worshipping of angels, intruding into those
   things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up with his fleshly mind;'
   and vers. 22, 23, Why are ye subject to ordinances after the
   commandments and doctrines of men? which things have indeed a show of
   wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body.'
   Contempt of magistracy: 2 Peter ii. 10, But chiefly them that walk
   after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government;
   presumptuous are they, self-willed, and are not afraid to speak evil of
   dignities.' Thus you see how it began to work, and that the devil from
   the beginning had sown these tares.

   But was it, then, in the apostle's time that the mystery of iniquity
   did begin to work? Then--

   1. We see what need we have to withstand the beginnings, and not give
   way to a further encroachment on the church of God; and--

   2. That the word of God should dwell richly in us, for we have to deal
   with mystical iniquity.

   III. Proposition: That when that impediment shall be removed, then
   Antichrist shall be revealed; only he that now letteth will let till he
   be taken out of the way. Where observe--

   1. It was before, to` kate'chon, that which letteth; now it is o
   kate'chon, he that letteth the empire and the emperor. And mark, a long
   succession of empires is called o kate'chon: why not then a long
   succession of popes, the man of sin, the son of perdition?

   2. He that now letteth will let. Antichrist was but in fieri, and that
   secretly and in a mystery; there was desire of rule, some superstitious
   and false doctrines, some mixture of human inventions, borrowed both
   from Jewish and heathenish rites, mingled with the worship of God, some
   secret rising of antichristian dominion, some playing at lesser game,
   as Victor took upon him to excommunicate the Eastern churches for the
   matter of Easter. But before this obstacle was removed, he could not
   fully appear and invade the empire of God and men till the emperor was
   removed out of that city: while the heathen emperors prevailed, there
   was no place for churchmen's ambition; their times were times of
   persecution, and it is not persecution, but peace and plenty, that
   breedeth corruption in the churches.

   3. He, that is, the emperor, must be taken out of the way, that is,
   either by the removal of his person and throne from the city of Rome,
   or till the Roman empire be ruined, as it was in the East by the Turk,
   in the West by the incursions of many barbarous nations, parting it
   into ten kingdoms, and then by the translation of the empire to Charles
   the Great.

   Well, then, note three things for the time of Antichrist:--

   1. Before the obstacle was removed he could not appear.

   2. When this obstacle was removed, presently he appeared.

   3. The degrees of the falling of the one are the degrees of the
   exaltation and establishment of the other, for Antichrist did grow up
   upon it.

   But they say, the Roman empire is not quite fallen, there being a Roman
   emperor still. But (1.) the present empire is but inane nomen, or umbra
   imperii--a mere name, or a shadow of the empire. (2.) He that then let,
   in St Paul's time, was the succession of the Roman emperors, but this
   is the German empire; now, if the Roman empire were the only impediment
   (the apostle useth the word mo'non, therefore as soon as that should be
   removed, Antichrist would infallibly be revealed. (3.) Though this
   empire be not abolished, but removed out of Rome, it is enough to make
   good Paul's prophecy. Dixit apostolus, imperium esse de medio
   tollendum, non prorsus delendum.--(Whitaker.) Well, then, since the
   seat is left void, either the prophecy is riot accomplished at the
   time, or else the Pope is Antichrist, for the nations are long since
   fallen away from the Roman empire, and the emperor hath no power nor
   authority at Rome.

   Use. To give a new note to discover and descry the man of sin.
   Certainly Antichrist is already revealed, and we may find him some
   where. I prove it by two arguments:--(1.) The mystery began to work in
   the apostle's days; therefore surely it is completed by this time, and
   not reserved to a short space of time a little before Christ's coming
   to judgment; (2.) This spiritual usurped power was to break forth upon
   the fall of the empire; accordingly so it did, though it grew to its
   monstrous excess and height by degrees, as to ecclesiastical dominion,
   in Boniface III., who obtained from Phocas the title of universal
   bishop; whereas Gregory the Great called John of Constantinople the
   forerunner of Antichrist for arrogating the same title.

SERMON VI.

   And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
   with the breath of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his
   coming.--2 Thes. II. 8.

   THESE words contain both the rise and ruin of Antichrist, his
   revelation and destruction.

   1. As to his revelation, there are two things:--

   [1.] The title given to Antichrist: ho anomos, the wicked.

   [2.] His appearing in the world upon the taking away the impediment:
   shall be revealed.

   2. As to his ruin, three things are observable:--

   [1.] The progress of his destruction, which is here considered as
   begun, or as consummated.

   (1.) A diminishing of antichristianism: whom the Lord shall consume.

   (2.) The finishing thereof, in the word destroy.

   [2.] The author, the Lord.

   [3.] The means.

   (1.) God's word, called his breath, or the Spirit of his mouth.

   (2.) The brightness of his coming, namely, when he shall come to judge
   the world in the glory of the Father.

   First, Of the rising of Antichrist: And then shall that wicked be
   revealed.'

   1. The title given to Antichrist, ho anomos, that lawless one, or son
   of Belial. It is the property of Antichrist to boast himself to be
   above all laws, and to be judged by no power upon earth; for therein he
   resembleth Antiochus, of whom it is said, He shall do according to his
   own will,' Dan. xi. 36. Now if this be one of his characters, it will
   not be hard to find him out; for who is that infallible judge that
   taketh upon him to decide all controversies, and judgeth all things,
   and is judged of no man? and whosoever doth but mutter against his
   decrees and delusions, if a private person, he is to be destroyed with
   fire and sword; if a prince, to be excommunicated, deposed, and his
   subjects freed from all allegiance to him? Who is he that taketh upon
   him, with faculties, licenses, and pardons, to dispense with the law of
   God, and to allow open and notorious sins? Who is he that by his own
   writers is said to be Solutus omni lege humana, freed from all human
   law (Hostiensis), Nec ullo jure humano ligari potest, that hath a
   paramount authority to all laws, that he cannot be bound by them,
   whether they concern parricide, the murder of princes; or perjury, the
   obligation of oaths; or matrimony, the bond of conjugal relations? But
   one expressly saith, that he is supra jus, contra jus, extra jus, above
   law, against law, and without law; a plain description of the lawless
   one in the text; and another, not without some spice of blasphemy, Apud
   Deum et Papam sufficit pro ratlone voluntas, God and the Pope have
   their will for a law. Lastly, Who is he that hath brought into the
   church the great impiety of worshipping of God by images, and the
   worship of the saints and angels, with a worship which is only due to
   God? which is the great anomi'a, the lawlessness, which the pure
   Christian rule condemneth and brandeth for such. If there be not such a
   power extant in the Christian world, then I confess we are yet to seek
   for Antichrist; but if there be, none so wilfully blind as they that
   cannot see wood for trees, and know not where to fix this character.

   2. His revelation: Then shall that wicked be revealed.' The word
   revealed noteth two things:--

   [1.] His appearance in the world.

   [2.] God's discovery of him.

   [1.] Then he shall be revealed beareth this sense, He shall be in the
   world, and begin to lift up his head as soon as the Roman emperor and
   empire shall be removed; this lawless one shall begin to discover
   himself and set up his kingdom.

   Now to understand this, consider this:--

   (1.) The most learned interpreters, both ancient and modern, agree in
   this, that the impediment was the Roman empire, as we showed before;
   and therefore as the Roman empire and emperor were removed out of the
   way, Antichrist was to be revealed, or the predictions of the scripture
   are false.

   (2.) Things of great moment cannot be removed nor established in a
   minute. The removing of the Roman empire was not all at once, nor the
   rising of the pontificate, but by degrees the seat began to be made
   void. When Constantine began to remove the imperial throne to
   Byzantium, though the majesty of the empire continued still at Rome,
   yet this was a step to the removing of the impediment, for by that
   means the popes grew in greatness; but as the emperor's authority was
   lessened, so grew that of the popes, who still encroached to themselves
   more and more power, and that to promote the apostasy and derogation
   from the pure Christian religion. But as soon as he arose, he came not
   to the height of his power, either ecclesiastical or temporal, nor
   shall he presently decay.

   (3.) To state the progress of antichristian tyranny is not for a
   sermon, it filleth whole books; but thus in short. About the year 600.
   or in that century, their ecclesiastical power began to be raised, when
   the majesty of the empire was low and weak in Italy, and therefore then
   was Antichrist advanced a good step. When John of Constantinople had
   usurped the title of universal bishop, Gregory the Great saith, Rex
   superbiae prope adest--the king of pride is near; et sacerdotum
   exercitus ei praeparatur--an army of priests is prepared to serve him
   as their general; this he--(fidenter dico, I speak confidently) and
   within six years or thereabouts Phocas conferred on Pope Boniface the
   same title, to ingratiate himself with the people of that part of the
   empire, after the murder of his lord and master. And then many
   superstitions were gotten into the church; as, about the year 688, the
   Pope obtained of the emperor the Pantheon, or temple of all-devils, and
   consecrated the same to the Virgin Mary, and all saints. The temporal
   monarchy was long in hatching, but yet the beginning of this mystery
   soon bewrayed itself. In the beginning of the seventh century,
   Constantine the Pope would have his foot kissed, like another
   Diocletian, and in defence of image-worship he openly resisted
   Philippicus, the Emperor of Greece, and encouraged Justine and
   Anastasius, tyrants and murderers, who submitted themselves to him with
   adoration. Rebellion and idolatry have been ever continued since. In
   the year 720, or thereabouts, Gregory the Second and Third continued
   the same idolatry and rebellion, and caused all Italy to withdraw their
   obedience from the Emperor Leo, because he had commanded all images to
   be broken and burnt, and for the same cause excommunicated him, and
   took to himself the Coctian Alps as the gift of the Lombards. In the
   same century, 749, Zachary encourageth and assisteth Pepin to depose
   his master Childeric, king of France, and to take upon him that
   kingdom. Afterward Adrian took upon him to translate the empire of the
   Greeks to the Latins; and ever since deposed emperors and made broils
   in kingdoms.

   [2.] God's discovery of him to the world; that is, when Antichrist was
   not only extant, but impleaded as such; and this also was by degrees,
   God raising up in every age witnesses against the tyranny and
   usurpations of Rome, as the place, and the Pope, the person, as,
   considered in his succession, claiming the same power. Five hundred
   years before Luther, Peter Bruis began, and Henry his scholar succeeded
   him, and both of them succeeded by the Waldenses and Albigenses; then
   Wicliffe, the Bohemians, who have all pleaded and proved that the Pope
   was the very Antichrist; then Savonarola in Italy preached this boldly.
   In the fifteenth century, about 1500, there were some remainder of the
   Albigenses about the Alps, some few relics of the Hussites and
   Cahxtines in Bohemia, so few and so ignorant that they had neither
   learning nor ability to oppose this potent tyranny. Then God raised up
   Luther, and many other worthies to assault the idolatry, tyranny, and
   errors of the church of Rome; and it is reported in history, that the
   angel on the top of the Tower St Angelo was beaten down by a
   thunderbolt; and in the very day and in the church where Pope Leo the
   Tenth at Rome had created thirty-one cardinals, a sudden tempest dashed
   the keys out of the hands of the image of St Peter, showing God would
   begin to take away their power.

   Use. If God hath revealed Antichrist, let no man shut his eyes, but lei
   him be shunned, forsaken, and abhorred. When Christ was to come into
   the world, it was a day of rumours; some sent to John Baptist, whether
   he were the Christ, others cried up false Christs and impostors; but
   the people were alarmed with a general expectation. So when Antichrist
   was to be revealed, it was a day of rumours; just about the time there
   was a great expectation: some pitched it here, some there, until the
   pit was discovered to the church, and the snare laid open. And now to
   run wilfully into these errors, how damnable is it! If Papists cleave
   to him, let not Protestants fall to him; to continue Papists is
   dangerous, for they favour Antichrist, and serve Antichrist; but to
   turn Papists is more dangerous, for this is a down right revolt from
   Christ to Antichrist. And how God may in mercy dispense with errors
   imbibed in our education we know not; but to turn our back on the
   truth, wherein we have been educated and instructed, maketh it more
   dangerous to our salvation.

   Secondly, We now come to the more comfortable part, his ruin; where
   note:--

   I. In the general, that the apostle, as soon as he had showed his rise,
   he presently foretelleth his ruin, to support the hearts of the
   faithful, though he hath yet more things to speak concerning his
   discovery, ver. 9. I cannot let this pass without an observation,

   Doct. That a spiritual eye can discern the ruin of wicked instruments,
   even in their rise and reign: Job v. 3, I have seen the foolish taking
   root, and presently I cursed his habitation.' By the foolish, is meant
   the wicked; by their taking root, their seeking to fix and settle
   themselves in their worldly prosperity; I presently, that is, without
   any great deliberation, which in this matter needeth not, cursed their
   habitation, not as desiring, but as foreseeing and foretelling. I
   pronounced them accursed, or to be in a cursed condition; when carnal
   men seek to root and establish themselves upon earth, to a spiritual
   eye, their best estate is miserable and detestable. When we see their
   rise, we may foretell their fall.

REASONS.

   1. Their faith occasions such a reflection, which is the evidence of
   things not seen.' Heb. xi. 1. They look not at things as at present
   they seem to shortsighted men, or as they relish to the flesh, but as
   they appear, and will be judged of at last; their ruin is as present
   before them as their rise; present time is quickly past. But now
   without faith this cannot be: 2 Peter i. 9, He that lacketh these
   things is blind and cannot see afar off,' muopa'zon, but are dazzled
   with present splendour, and so miscarry.

   2. This faith is necessary:--(1.) Partly to prevent scandal at the
   prosperity of an ungodly party who obey not the gospel, but corrupt and
   pervert it to their worldly ends. David's steps were even gone when he
   saw the prosperity of the wicked, till he went into the sanctuary and
   understood their end, Ps. lxxiii. 17; that settled his heart, to
   consider what end these men were appointed unto. How prosperous soever
   they seem to be for the present, yet the end must put the difference;
   there they see the wicked in the height of their prosperity, as ready
   to be cut down and withered. (2.) To prevent apostasy. They choose the
   better part that choose the holiness and patience of the saints: 2 Cor.
   iv. 18, While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
   things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal,
   but the things which are not seen are eternal.' But things present
   carry away our hearts, because we have so dim and doubtful a sight of
   things to come; whereas, if we did look upon them and near, they would
   fortify us against temptations: Prov. 32. Envy thou not the oppressor,
   and choose none of his ways; for the froward is abomination to the
   Lord, but his secret is with the righteous.'

   II. More particularly the ruin of Antichrist is set forth:--

   1. Partly by the manner of his fall. It is represented both as begun
   and finished: he shall be consumed, he shall be destroyed; the one
   noteth a lingering delay, the other an utter perdition, that he shall
   be finally rooted out.

   First, Consumed; to consume is to waste and melt away by little and
   little.

   Doct. Antichrist is not presently to be destroyed, but to waste away by
   a lingering consumption; as his rising was by little and little, so is
   his fall; he loseth his authority in Christendom by degrees.

   Now the reasons may be these:--

   1. God hath a ministry and use for him and the abettors of his kingdom,
   as he hath a use for the devil himself, therefore permitteth him some
   limited power; but yet he holdeth him in the chains of his invincible
   providence. So hath he a use for the devil's eldest son, for
   Antichrist, and antichristian adversaries, which, if their power were
   wholly gone, could not be performed; as--

   [1.] To scourge his people for their sins, as their contempt of the
   gospel, and wantonness under the several privileges which they enjoy by
   it. God will not want a rod to scourge his disobedient children; as,
   Isa. x. 5, he calleth the Assyrian the rod of his anger,' the
   instrument that he maketh use of to punish those with whom he is angry.
   And again, the staff of his indignation,'--the staff is a heavier and
   sorer instrument of correction than a rod. What the Assyrian was to the
   Jews, that Antichrist is to professing Christians. God useth him till
   he have sufficiently chastised his children, and then he will cast this
   rod into the fire. Heathens and Turks are at a distance from us: our
   miseries will come from antichristianism, who are nearer at hand to
   execute the Lord's vengeance when we grow wanton.

   [2.] To try his people, for he expects a tried obedience; what
   Christianity we will accept and choose--that calculated for this world,
   or that which is calculated for the next. Antichristianism, in all the
   branches of it, is a sort of religion suited to worldly interests: 1
   John iv. 5, They are of the world; therefore speak they of the world,
   and the world heareth them;' but true Christianity is for the kingdom
   of heaven: 1 Cor. ii. 12, Now we have received, not the spirit of the
   world, but the spirit which is of God.' Therefore God will try who are
   the formal and pretended Christians, that serve their own bellies, and
   the sincere Christians, who look to an unseen world, and are willing to
   hazard their own interests out of their fidelity to Christ; therefore,
   when the saints under the altar groaned: Rev. vi. 10, How long, Lord,
   holy and true, dost thou not avenge our blood on them that dwell on the
   earth?' the answer given was, ver. 11, that they should rest for a
   season until their fellow-servants, and also their brethren that should
   be killed, as they were, should be fulfilled.' In every age God will
   have his witnesses, who by their faith and patience, and not loving
   their lives to the death, should promote the Lamb's kingdom before they
   receive their crown; and therefore, though Antichrist be consumed more
   and more, yet he hath so many abettors of his kingdom left as may try
   the faith and patience of the saints.

   [3.] To cure our divisions. Nazianzen called the enemies kuinoi`
   diallaktai`, the common reconcilers. The dog is let loose to make the
   sheep flock together. We are hardened in our strifes against each other
   till a common danger unite us. It is noted that when there was a strife
   between the herdsmen of Abraham's cattle and Lot's cattle, the
   Canaanite and Perizzite were yet in the land, Gen. xiii. 7. God will
   unite those in common sufferings whose stubborn humours will not suffer
   them to meet upon other terms.

   [4.] To keep up a remembrance of his mercies: Ps. lix. 11, Slay them
   not, lest my people forget; scatter them by thy power, and bring them
   down, O Lord, our shield.' God maketh us sensible of the care he hath
   over us, not by the utter destruction of the enemies of his people, but
   by lingering judgments on them, which affect us more than if they were
   cut off suddenly.

   2. Many other reasons may be given, because it serveth the beauty and
   harmony of his providence to cut them off in their time, and by such
   means as he hath appointed, and in such a way as shall most conduce
   unto his glory. But I pass them by; we must tarry his leisure, and not
   question his truth and care over us, and be content that our faith and
   patience be exercised. If God should bring a sudden destruction upon a
   power and tyranny so supported by the combined interests of the world,
   we were not able to bear it. Thorns serve for a fence to a garden of
   roses. God would not destroy the Canaanites at once, lest the beasts of
   the field should increase upon them, Deut. vii. 22; nor all abettors of
   antichristianism, lest his people should lie open to such evils as they
   cannot bear.

   [1.] Observe this consumption, how it is accomplished. If we find
   Antichrist risen, discovered, and consumed, why should we be in doubt
   any longer? The pomp and height was much about 1500 years after Christ;
   what a consumption hath happened since, by the reviving religion and
   learning, the Christian world should with thankfulness take notice of,
   by the falling of Germany, England, France, and Hungary in a great
   part, together with Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and other countries; and
   by what means hath this been but by the Spirit of his mouth? It is
   profitable to know Antichrist by his rise and description; but it is
   comfortable to know him by his discovery and consumption, and God's
   blessing such unlikely means at the beginning to such a wonderful
   effect. When Luther first appeared, the bishop of Strasburg told him,
   Abi in coelum, mi frater, et dic, miserere nostri. But God hath done
   great things for us too: when he first turned the captivity of his
   churches, we were like unto those that dream.

   [2.] Caution. Antichrist is consumed, but he is not yet dead. What
   strength he may recover before his last destruction, God knoweth.
   Popery after it was cast out, hath re-entered Bohemia and Austria, and
   the emperor's hereditary countries; and what havoc hath been made of
   the evangelical churches, the book of Caraffa, the bishop and legate of
   the Pope, called Germania sacra restaurata, showeth, wherein many
   notable things concerning their artifices to replant Popery are set
   down. As to England, some hope his consumption is not desperate, and
   many fear that Popery may recover again, unless God in mercy prevent
   it. We know not what is in the womb of providence, or how far the
   prerogative of free grace may interpose in our behalf--whether England
   shall be made a theatre of mercy once more, or the seat of idolatry,
   and superstition, and blood. But though we do not know what God hath
   determined, yet we may soon know what England hath deserved. And that
   is enough to quicken us to watch fulness and prayer, and expectation,
   and serious preparation for the day of evil; and by these things, if it
   cometh to pass, it will do us no harm.

   (1.) When God hath laid in great store of comforts against sufferings,
   usually there is a time of expense to lay them out again. Christ warned
   his hearers to make use of the light, because of the darkness coming
   upon them, John xii. 35, 36. You never knew the gospel powerfully
   preached, but trials came: Heb. x. 32-34, For ye had compassion of me
   in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in
   yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.'
   Castles are first victualled, then besieged: the ministry is
   consolatory mostly.

   (2.) When men can neither bear our vices nor their proper remedies:
   Ezek. xxiv. 13, In thy filthiness is lewdness; because I have purged
   thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy
   filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee;'
   Hosea vii. 1, When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of
   Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria, for they commit
   falsehood,' &c.

   (3.) When there are great differences amongst God's own people, the end
   is bitter; we warp in the sunshine, will not know the way of peace.
   Eusebius says, before Diocletian's persecution, philoneiki'ais
   anephle'gonto--the church was torn with intestine broils, pastors
   against pastors, and people against people. Ease begets pride and
   wantonness, and that maketh way for contention.

   (4.) When profaneness increaseth, and men do not walk becoming the
   gospel, God taketh the gospel from them. The apostasy from the power
   and purity of religion first made way for Antichrist, and is most
   likely to let him in again.

   (5.) When a people are prepared for such impressions, there is a party
   formed, partly by opinions that symbolise with Popery, partly by doting
   on the pomp and outside of religion, and neglecting the life and power
   of it; and partly when indifferent and atheistical conceits do dispose
   their minds no more to one religion than another: usually then is a
   nation fitted for such a change.

   Now what shall we do?

   1. Watch and pray. A people well awaked will not change their religion.
   The envious man sowed tares while the servants slept, Mat. xiii. 25. Be
   instant with God in prayer, as all good Christians should be, when the
   church is in danger; as David, Ps. lix. 13, Consume them in wrath,
   consume them, that they may not be, that they may know that God rules
   in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.' The consumption is at
   hand: Luke xxi. 36, Watch ye, therefore, and pray always, that ye may
   be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass.'

   2. Reform and repent: Rev. ii. 5, Repent, or I will remove thy
   candlestick out of his place.' Our disorders must be bewailed and
   redressed. There are two stumbling-blocks the idolatry of the Romish
   synagogue, and the evil manners of the Reformed Churches.

   3. Be fortified and established:--

   [1.] By knowledge. If we have not i'dion sterugmo`n, a stedfastness of
   our own, we shall fall, 2 Peter iii. 17; in a time of long peace, arms
   hang up a-rusting; and so we are not prepared to resist temptations.

   [2.] By grace: It is good the heart should be established by grace,'
   Heb. xiii. 9. The new nature will caution men against many popish
   errors: 1 John ii. 20, Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye
   know all things.' A child of God hath something in his bosom that will
   not permit him to hearken to Popery; the very life in us is opposite to
   this dead show and mummery of trashy devotions.

   Now I come to the author, with the means of consuming: The Lord shall
   consume him with the spirit of his mouth.' The Lord, that is the Lord
   Christ. But what is meant by the spirit of his mouth, or the breath of
   his mouth, as some render it? Two things may be meant hereby--either
   his providential word, or his gospel, accompanied by his Spirit.

   1. His providential word; that is, when Christ saith, Let it be done,
   it shall be done: Isa. xi. 4, He shall smite the earth with the rod of
   his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.'
   Those that are called wicked, they are also called the earth, because
   they are earthly-minded, and have their portion here, and possess much
   on earth, and have great power, by the advantage of which they oppress
   his people. Now, to execute judgment upon them, Christ needeth no more
   than the rod of his mouth, that powerful word whereby he created all
   things: Ps. xxxiii. 6, By the words of the Lord were the heavens made,
   and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth;' upholdeth all
   things: Heb. i. 3, Upholding all things by the word of his power;' and
   brings all things to nothing again: John xviii. 6, As soon as he had
   said to them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground;'--one
   word of his powerful providence is enough. Or, secondly--

   2. It is meant of the efficacy of his gospel, as it is accompanied by
   his Spirit, called The sword of the Spirit.' Eph. vi. 17. And it is
   said to be quick and powerful.' Heb. iv. 12; and Rev. ii. 16, Repent,
   or I will come against thee quickly, and smite thee with the sword of
   my mouth.' By this word he shall confound the falsehood and cunning
   practices which are carried on under this mystery of iniquity, and give
   it such a deadly and incurable wound, that it shall languish before it
   be utterly destroyed.

   Doct. That Antichrist's destruction is by the preaching of the gospel,
   and the victorious evidence of truth. It must needs be so, for his
   kingdom and tyranny is upheld by darkness, which is dispelled by the
   light of the truth; and, therefore, the Papists, as all other heretics,
   are lucifugae scripturarum Dei--cannot endure the scriptures, deny them
   to the people, and seek to make them contemptible by all the means they
   can. Again, his kingdom is carried on by falsehood; and his cheats, and
   impostures, and wickedness, and usurpation, and false interpretations
   and delusions are discovered by the truth and simplicity of the gospel,
   and so is consumed yet more and more. Lastly, Popery is a dead form of
   religion, and there is not only truth in the word of God, but life; we
   are not only enlightened, but quickened b^ it. and converted to God,
   and made partakers of his Spirit; and these will go against their own
   experience and inclination, if they should sit down with such empty,
   beggarly rudiments.

   But here ariseth a question, Shall Antichrist be consumed no other way
   but by the spirit of his mouth? We read in the prophecy of wars, by
   which the antichristian state is brought to nought. I answer--The pure
   and powerful preaching of the gospel is the principal means whereby the
   Spirit of the Lord consumeth Antichrist in the hearts of men; but this
   is not exclusive of other means which God, in the ways of his
   providence, may use to weaken his worldly interest. But we must
   distinguish between the means God may use and we must use. Simply to
   put down a religion by force of arms is not our way; it is not lawful
   certainly to invade other nations upon the pure and sole title of
   religion; but if they invade us on that account, no doubt a prince and
   people so invaded may defend themselves. But when a war is commenced on
   other occasions, it is the most cheerful cause to engage in. When we
   war against the abettors of Antichrist, we war against an enemy whom
   God will consume. Constantine warred against Licinius, his colleague,
   not because an infidel, but because he persecuted the Christians,
   contrary to their capitulations. Lewis XII. caused it to be disputed in
   a synod at Tours, Num liceret Papae absque causa principi bellum
   inferre? when it was answered, Non licet; a second question, Num tali
   principi sua defensione fas sit eum invadere? Their answers were Licet,
   which he undertook, and caused money to be stamped with this
   inscription--Perdam Babylonem.

   Use 1. We learn hence not to be discouraged in our greatest
   extremities, when all temporal hopes seem to fail, and we have nothing
   left us but the word of our testimony. Let us not distrust our
   spiritual weapons, for they are mighty through God to bring down all
   the strong holds of sin and Antichrist, 2 Cor. x. 4, 5. Oh, encourage
   yourselves in the Lord; you have the merit of his humiliation, and the
   power of his exaltation. Merit, what cannot the blood of Christ do to
   fetch off men from their inveterate prejudices and superstitions? 1
   Peter i. 18, We are redeemed by the blood of Christ from our vain
   conversation.' So, for the power of his exaltation, there is his
   Spirit. The success of his Spirit on the pouring out of the first
   sermon, Acts ii. 41, fetched in 3000 souls that had imbrued their hands
   in the blood of their Saviour, and were in no very devout posture at
   that time. His word, that is, The rod of his strength,' Ps. cx. 2,
   which hath a mighty power to convince, transform, and convert souls:
   Rom. i. 16, For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, which is the
   power of God unto salvation.' Then there is the power of providence;
   all judgment is put into Christ's hands for the advancement of his own
   kingdom, John v. 22. If all be in Christ's hands, why should you
   distrust your cause, or the success of it?

   2. If you would defend yourselves, and wound the enemy, be much
   acquainted with the word of God, which is the sword of the Spirit.'
   Eph. vi. 17; thereby you may ward off every blow of a temptation.
   Surely then we should be much acquainted with this word, that it may
   dwell in us richly, that we may have it ready; this is enough to make
   wise the simple for all necessary duties and defence.

   3. Pray heartily that the word of God may have a free course, 2 Thes.
   iii. 1, and that God would send forth labourers into his harvest, Mat.
   ix. 38.

   Secondly, The final destruction of Antichrist: and destroy him by the
   brightness of his coming. This coming is most likely to be the coming
   of Christ, so often mentioned: 2 Thes. i. 7, 8, When the Lord Jesus
   shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire,
   taking vengeance on those that know not God, and that obey not the
   gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;' 2 Thes. ii. 1-3, Now we beseech you,
   brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
   together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor be troubled,
   neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the
   day of Christ is at hand.' Others conceive some notable manifestation
   of his presence and power in his church; but this would engage us in
   many dark prophecies, which I shall not meddle withal (intending only a
   doctrinal discovery of Antichrist), as how long before his coming, by
   what means. Sure I am, that at his coming, The beast and false prophet
   shall be slain, and cast into the lake of fire,' Rev. xix. 20; but for
   other things, I have not light enough certainly to define that the
   utter ruin of Antichrist is not to be expected till the second coming
   of Christ.

   Use. Be not discouraged though Antichrist yet remain after all the
   endeavours against him.

   It is enough that antichristianism shall be finished and finally
   destroyed; and for the time refer it to God. If it be not till the day
   of judgment, or Christ's final conquest over all his adversaries, you
   must be contented to tarry for that, as well as for other things.

SERMON VII.

   Even him whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power,
   and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of
   unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love
   of the truth, that they might be saved.--2 Thes. II. 9, 10.

   WE have considered the titles of Antichrist, his nature and properties,
   the time of his rise, and with it his ruin; now we are to consider the
   way and means how he doth acquire and keep up this power in the world.

   The means are--(1.) Principal; (2.) Instrumental.

   1. Principal: kat' energeian tou Satana,--after the working of Satan.

   2. Instrumental, which are also two:--

   [1.] Pretence of miracles: with all power, signs, and lying wonders.

   [2.] Other cheats and impostures: with all deceivableness of
   unrighteousness; their general way of dealing being sophistical and
   fallacious. Let us a little explain these things.

   1. The great agent in setting up this kingdom: After the working of
   Satan.' It may note the manner, as we render after, that is, in such a
   way as Satan deceived our first parents, for he was a murderer and a
   liar from the beginning,' John viii. 44;' I fear, lest by any means, as
   the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtilty, so your minds should be
   corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ,' 2 Cor. xi. 3. So all
   this mystery of iniquity shall be carried on after this manner: by
   deceit, by the tricks of lying men, and the works of deceiving spirits.
   Bather it noteth Satan's agency and influence, and after, or according
   to the working of Satan, is as much as by the working of Satan, noting
   not only his pattern, but his influence; so is kata` often rendered,
   and the energy of the devil, and influence upon all wickedness is
   spoken of elsewhere: Eph. ii. 2, The spirit that now worketh in the
   children of disobedience.' The devil hath a great hand over wicked men
   in the world; his way of dealing with them is most efficacious and
   powerful, and certainly he is the first founder and main supporter of
   the antichristian state.

   2. The instrumental means.

   [1.] By pretence of miracles: With all power, and signs, and lying
   wonders.' These three words signify the same thing, and are often
   joined when true miracles are spoken of; as 2 Cor. xii. 12, Truly the
   signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all places, in signs, and
   wonders, and mighty deeds.'--duna'meis, se'mata, te'rata. So Acts ii.
   22, Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles,
   wonders, and signs;' so Heb. ii. 4, God also bearing them witness, both
   with signs and^ wonders, and with divers miracles;' Rom. xv. 19, 4
   Through mighty signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of
   God,' Powers they are called, because they issue from power divine and
   extraordinary; signs, from their use, because they serve to seal and
   signify the doctrine to which they are applied; wonders, from their
   effect, because they breed astonishment in the minds of the be holders:
   these were the true miracles. Now, Antichrist, to countenance his false
   doctrines and superstitions, would ape and imitate Christ, and
   pretendeth to powers, signs, and wonders: as Jannes and Jambres sought
   to imitate Moses, God permitting it in some degree; so Antichrist seeks
   to promote his kingdom the same way which Christ took to promote
   evangelical truth. But they are called powers, and signs, and lying
   wonders, i.e., lying powers, lying signs, and lying wonders, for it
   agreeth to all the words, though affixed only to one of them. But why
   lying wonders? Partly because the greatest number of them are mere
   fables, notorious impostures, and forgeries; partly because others are
   diabolical illusions, things beyond human, but not angelical power. If
   they are thau'mata,--wonders, they are not semeia, as Chrysostom
   distinguished, fit signs to signify the truth of the doctrines; partly
   from the end and scope, for that must also be regarded. God cautioneth
   his people, that if they gave them a sign and wonder, though it came to
   pass, if it were to draw them to other gods, it was to be rejected,
   Deut. xiii. 1-3; the spirits must be tried whether they be of God, 1
   John iv. 1; 1 Cor. xii. 3, No man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth
   Jesus accursed.' If a wonder be wrought, or pretended to be wrought, to
   draw us off from Christ, or to promote things clearly for bidden by the
   word of God, it is a lying wonder, as all Antichrist's are; for their
   end is to confirm the Pope's dominion and false doctrine. The sum is
   this, then: that many things are pretended, not really done, impostures
   and forgeries, not miracles; other things, done by diabolical
   illusions, as there may be apparitions, visions, spectres, for Satan
   will bestir himself to keep up the credit of his ministers. Lastly, if
   we cannot otherwise disprove them, if they tend to false doctrine and
   worship, they are to be rejected, whatever extraordinary appearance
   there be in them.

   [2.] The other expression concerning the means is general: With all
   deceivableness of unrighteousness;' which compriseth--

   (1.) Their sophistical reasoning from antiquity, unity, infallibility,
   without coming to the intrinsic merits of the cause, but condemning the
   truth rather by prejudice.

   (2.) Their practical acts and feats to beguile souls, by fawning or
   threatening, or preferment and persecutions; these are the arts by
   which Antichrist shall deceive men into unrighteousness, that is, to
   bring this corruption into the church, and acquire this power to
   himself.

   Now I shall observe some points.

   Doct. 1. The devil hath a great hand in setting up Antichrist's
   kingdom, as he hath a great interest by it; his coming shall be by, or
   after the working of Satan. He is the raiser and supporter of that
   estate, and he is the great seducer, opposer, and adversary of the
   gospel. This will appear, if you consider, first, the properties of the
   devil--how the devil is set forth in scripture, and secondly, by what
   ways he promoteth his own kingdom.

   First. 1. By ignorance; for the devils are called, Eph. vi. 12, The
   rulers of the darkness of this world,' and his kingdom is called the
   kingdom of darkness.' Col. i. 13. The prince-like authority and
   government which by God's permission he exerciseth in the world, is
   over those who remain in a state of darkness and ignorance. Well, then,
   necessarily the devil must be a great friend to Popery, where ignorance
   not only reigneth, but is commended as the mother of devotion; it is
   into the ignorant part of the world and the church that the devil hath
   brought in errors in doctrine, formality and superstition in worship,
   and tyranny and usurpation in government.

   2. The next thing ascribed to him is error; so it is said, John viii.
   44, He abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him: when
   he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the
   father of it.' He soon apostatised from God and his way, and ever since
   is an enemy of all truth and goodness; he turned from God, and is a
   deceiver of others. To our first parents he called the truth of God in
   question, and was the inventor and beginner of all errors that have
   since fallen out in the world. Well, then, where should his eminent
   power and residence be, but in that society of professed Christians
   where most errors and corruptions in doctrine and worship have been
   introduced, where they teach men to pray to and for the dead, to adore
   the bread and worship it with divine worship, and to worship images,
   and to pray to God in a language which they understand not, and maim
   the Lord's Supper, and profess they can live perfectly without sin, and
   meritoriously and supererogate besides, and lay up a treasury of merits
   to redeem souls from purgatory? &c. There will be errors and mistakes
   in religion, while men are men; but where there is a wilful opposing of
   evident truths, and an obstinate refusing of all healing means, and men
   will abide in their errors rather than acknowledge that they have
   erred, surely they are governed by the influence of his counsels who
   abode not in the truth, and seeketh what he can to hinder the
   prevalency of it in the world.

   3. That which is ascribed to Satan is idolatry. This was his first and
   great endeavour in the world, to bring man to worship other gods rather
   than the true, or the true God by an idol. So he prevailed among the
   heathen; they thought their images did represent their gods, and that
   their gods dwelt in them, as our souls do in our bodies; therefore the
   Psalmist saith, all the gods of the nations are idols' or devils, Ps.
   xcvi. 5, and the devil was the great master and contriver of this
   idolatry; therefore it is said, Ps. cvi. 37, They sacrificed their sons
   and daughters unto devils.' The service done to idols or images of
   man's devising is not done to God, as men pretend who worship them, but
   to devils, who are the devisers, suggesters, and enticers of men unto
   all sorts of unlawful worship, and are in effect served and obeyed by a
   false religion: Deut. xxxii. 17, They sacrificed unto devils, not unto
   God;' 2 Cor. x. 20, The things which the Gentiles sacrificed, they
   sacrificed unto devils, not unto God;' 2 Chron. xi. 15, And he ordained
   him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves
   which he had made;'--they otherwise meant it: Jeroboam intended it to
   the true God Jehovah, but it was of the devil's invention. Now if the
   devil can get such a party in the church as shall not only set up but
   be mad upon image-worship, who can more serve his turn among professing
   Christians than they who have consented to and continued in idolatrous
   worship? Surely then Satan is concerned to befriend their usurpations,
   and uphold their interests; for what will more conduce to the ruin of
   Christianity, or at least the decay of the power thereof?

   4. That which is ascribed to Satan is bloody cruelty, or seeking the
   destruction of Christ's most faithful servants; for he is called a
   murderer from the beginning,' John viii. 44; and Cain is said to be of
   that wicked one, because he slew his brother; and wherefore slew he
   him? because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous,' 1
   John iii. 12. Enmity to the power of godliness came from Satan; and
   wherever it is encouraged, and notoriously practised, they are a party
   of men governed and influenced by Satan. Now, where shall we find this
   character but in Antichrist's confederacy? In the prophecy of him, Rev.
   xiii. 15, he caused as many as would not worship the image of the beast
   to be killed; and again, Rev. xvii. 5, The woman, whose name was
   Mystery, was drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of
   the martyrs of Jesus;' and it hath been eminently fulfilled in the
   blood shed in Germany, France, and England, and other nations; and all
   this to extinguish the light of, and suppress the Reformation. The
   world is no stranger to their bloody persecutions. Oh, how many seeming
   Christians hath Satan employed in these works of cruelty! When once he
   had seduced the church to so many errors, and corrupted the doctrine
   and worship of Christ, he presently maketh the erroneous party his
   instruments of as cruel and bloody persecutions as were ever commenced
   by infidels and Mahometans; witness their murders upon so many
   thousands of the Waldenses and Albigenses, whom they not only spoiled,
   but slaughtered with all manner of hellish cruelty. Some of their own
   bishops complained they could not find lime and stone to build prisons
   for them, nor defray the charges of their food. The world was even
   amazed at their unheard-of cruelties, smoking and burning thousands of
   men, women, and children in caves, others at stakes, and many ways
   butchering them; proclaiming croisados, and preaching up the merit of
   paradise to such bloody cut-throats as had a mind to root them out,
   driving multitudes to perish in snowy mountains. What desolations they
   wrought in Bohemia, what horrible massacres in France, what fires they
   kindled in England, and of late, what cruelties they exercised in
   Ireland, Piedmont! &c. Histories will tell you, and will tell all
   generations to come, what principles Rome is acted by, and how
   insatiable their thirst is for the blood of upright righteous men. And
   after all this, tell me, who is he whose coming is after the working of
   Satan? and whether we have cause to be enamoured of blood, and fires,
   and inquisitions?

   5. That which is ascribed to Satan is, that he is the God of this
   world,' 2 Cor. iv. 4; and again, the prince of this world,' John xii.
   31. He playeth the god here; the riches, honours, and wealth of this
   world are the great instruments of his kingdom; and the men of this
   world, whose portion is in this life, are the proper subjects of his
   kingdom. Of the saints, Christ is their head; but of the wicked,
   ungodly, ambitious world, surely Satan is the head. There are two
   cities (as Austin distinguisheth them): Jerusalem is the city of God,
   and Babylon, that incorporation which belongeth to Satan. Now, then,
   where shall we find him whose coming is after the working of Satan, but
   with him who, with the loss of Christianity, exalteth himself, and
   affecteth an ambitious tyranny and domineering over the Christian
   world, both princes, pastors, and people; and to uphold the tyranny,
   careth not what havoc he maketh of the church; and the whole frame of
   their religion is calculated for secular honour, worldly pomp, and
   greatness?

   Secondly, By the visible appearances of the devil, and where he is most
   conversant, as in his own kingdom. Before Christ's kingdom was set up,
   the devil did often visibly appear; but since, he playeth least in
   sight; when God openly manifested his presence by appearing to the
   fathers in sundry ways and manners, as he did before he spake to us by
   his Son, Heb. i. 1, 2, so did Satan; visions, apparitions, and oracles,
   were more frequent; and where Christ's spiritual kingdom prevaileth,
   the world heareth less of these things; but where it is obstructed,
   more. Now, two instances in Popery:--(1.) In their chiefs: how many
   conjurers and necromancers (who expressly consulted and contracted with
   the devil), from the year 600 to the year 1500, the chair of pestilence
   yielded, the histories tell us. (2.) In other duties, the devil had
   formerly, in the times of Popery, and still where it is allowed,
   incomparably more power among men to appear to them, and haunt their
   houses, and vex them, than now he hath; all that I say is, haunting of
   houses and apparitions were much more common.

   Uses. 1. A detestation of Popery; whatever is of the devil should be
   hated by us, for we are Christ's soldiers, listed in his warfare in
   baptism: Rom. vi. 13, Yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive
   from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto
   God; but yield not your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto
   sin;' Rom. xiii. 12, Let us cast off the works of darkness, and put on
   the armour of light.' Now, after our military oath, should we revolt to
   them that join with the devil and his angels, to make war against
   Michael and his angels?

   2. To be more careful to be completely armed, For we fight not against
   flesh and blood, but principalities and powers, and spiritual
   wickednesses in heavenly places.' Eph. vi. 11, 12; that is, not only
   with the one, but the other. The abettors of Popery are Satan's
   auxiliary forces, whom he stirreth up and employeth. Now, the devils
   are of great cunning and strength, and by God's permission exercise
   great authority in the world, and the matter about which we contend
   with them is the honour of God and Christ, and our eternal salvation.
   Therefore, since the subtlety, power, and strength of the enemy are so
   great, we had need to be the better prepared, and put on the whole
   armour of God. That bodily and human power that befriendeth the kingdom
   of Satan is formidable, and that can only reach the outward man; but
   devils and damned spirits are a more terrible and dangerous party, who
   secretly blind our minds and weaken our courage, and strangely and
   imperceptibly, by our own carnal affections, promote our eternal ruin.

   3. It showeth us the folly of reconciling Babel and Sion--Rome, as it
   is, and the Reformed Churches: For what concord hath Christ with
   Belial?' 2 Cor. vi. 15, 16; What agreement hath the temple of God with
   idols?' You can never reconcile God and Satan, the seed of the woman
   and the seed of the serpent. I speak not of holy endeavours to adjust
   the controversies, and reclaim papists from their errors; that must be
   pursued, how fruitless soever the attempt be; but to hope for an
   agreement, as things now stand, is impossible.

   4. Caution, that the devil prevail not against us; he once surprised
   Peter: Mat. xvi. 23, Get thee behind me, Satan;' he hath prevailed over
   them that usurp the highest chair in the Christian church. Let him not
   blind your eyes in whole or in part; though you be not drawn to
   antichristianism, do not live in a carnal, worldly course: For this
   purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works
   of the devil,' 1 John iii. 8. Every wicked act is Satan's invention; he
   stirreth it up, is served by it, delights in it, his kingdom goeth
   forward by it: he gaineth by every wicked action. Show plainly that you
   are not of his party, nor ever mean to be. Give way to fleshly and
   worldly lusts, and you are very prone to entertain the grossest
   temptations; and by subtle evasions will wriggle and distort yourselves
   out of your duty, as the papists do.

   I come now to the second means.

   Doct. That Antichrist doth uphold his kingdom by a false show of signs,
   and wonders, and mighty deeds. To evidence this--

   I. We must inquire what is a miracle? Miracles are works extraordinary,
   exceeding the ability of second causes, and done to confirm the truth.
   Where we may observe:--

   1. The general nature of them.

   2. Their author.

   3. Their use.

   1. Their general nature and kinds: extraordinary works. Some are either
   besides nature, when the course of nature is changed, as the standing
   still of the sun in Joshua's days, the going back of the shadow on
   Ahaz's dial in Hezekiah's time; above nature, as the opening of the
   eyes of a man born blind by Christ, John ix.; against nature, when the
   operation of it is obstructed, as when the three children remained
   untouched in the fiery furnace, Dan. iii.: the fire had not lost its
   property to burn, for those that cast them in were singed and scorched.

   2. The author: they are works exceeding the ability of second causes,
   and therefore are always done by the power of God, either immediately
   or mediately, using some creature in the performing of them, as the
   apostles of Christ. Well, then, the primary efficient cause is God, and
   the manner of working is extraordinary and unusual, exceeding the power
   and force of any creature.

   3. The end and use is to confirm some truth. When they are done for
   curiosity, ostentation, and delight, they are but juggling tricks, and
   have not God for their author; much less when they are pretended to
   confirm a false doctrine or evil end. But real miracles do oblige by
   way of sign, declaring God's interest in or owning of the truth and
   testimony to which they are annexed. For God, being the ruler of the
   world, good, merciful, just, it is not to be supposed he will
   co-operate to a lie or cheat, or leave such a stumbling-block before
   his creatures.

   II. That the miracles wrought by Christ and his apostles did
   sufficiently prove that they were teachers sent from God, for Christ
   often appealeth to his works: John v. 36, For the works which the
   Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness
   of me;' and John x. 38, Though ye believe not me,' that is, his
   personal verbal testimony, believe the works,' that is, his miracles,
   that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.'
   And when John sent his disciples to know whether he were the Messiah or
   no (not so much for his own confirmation as their satisfaction): Mat.
   xi. 4, Go, show him what ye hear and see;' and what was that?' The
   blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the
   deaf hear, and the dead are raised up,' &c. So Nicodemus was convinced
   by these: John iii. 2, We know that thou art a teacher come from God;
   for none can do the works that thou dost, except God were with him.' To
   improve these scriptures, let us consider:--

   1. The necessity of this attestation.

   2. The sufficiency of it.

   1. The necessity there was that Christ's person and office should be
   thus attested. He had the law of Moses to repeal, which was well known
   to be God's own law; a new law to promulgate, which is the law of
   faith, or the gospel; and before this could be received, it was needful
   for him to manifest his authority. Besides, he came to redeem and
   recover sinners to God from the devil, world, and flesh. And that he
   might be more readily and cheerfully entertained, it was necessary to
   be evidenced that he came not only by God's permission, but commission.
   For him hath the Father sealed,' John vi. 27, that is, authorised by
   miracles. Look, as in the first institution of the Aaronical
   priesthood, fire came from heaven to consume the sacrifices, whereas
   afterwards the high priests were consecrated and admitted by the
   ordinary rites, without any such attestation; so there was a greater
   necessity then, when God brought forth his Son into the world, and did
   first set up the gospel state, than there was afterwards, when the
   course and order of it was settled, and received in the world.

   2. The sufficiency of it. The miracles then wrought were numerous,
   evident, and undeniable, being done publicly in the sight of all, and
   therefore the clearest attestation to his doctrine, that flesh and
   blood could expect; such a stream of holy, necessary miracles, that
   were for the most part not acts of pomp, but of succour and relief, and
   such as could be done by no power less than divine; not like those
   ludicrous miracles they talk of in Popery, which look like a cheat
   rather than a sign from heaven. These miracles of Christ could no way
   be impeached; for either it must be by some truth of God, which the new
   revelation did contradict, and delivered by more certain means than
   those miracles were--but no such revelation was there; all fairly
   accorded with those former revelations of his mind given to the ancient
   church; and Christ and his apostles preached no other things than what
   suited with Moses and the prophets, Acts xxvi. 22--or else by some
   greater works which should contradict the testimony of these wonders,
   as Moses did the magicians of Egypt, Exod. vii. 18; but no such thing
   could be alleged, or was pretended, therefore these were sufficient.

   2. After the faith of Christ was sufficiently confirmed, miracles
   ceased; and it was fit they should cease, for God doth nothing
   unnecessarily. The Christian doctrine is the same that it was, and is
   to be the same till the end of the world; we have a sure and authentic
   record of it, which is the holy scriptures. The truth of Christ's
   office and doctrine is fully proved, and cometh transmitted to us by
   the consent of many successions of ages, in whose experience God hath
   blessed it to the converting, comforting, and saving of many a soul.
   Look, as the Jews, every time the law was brought forth, were not to
   expect the thunderings and lightnings, and the voice of the terrible
   trumpet, with which it was given at first on Mount Sinai (one solemn
   confirmation served for after ages); they knew it was a law given by
   the ministry of angels, and so entertained it with veneration and
   respect; so Christianity needed to be once solemnly confirmed (after
   ages have the use of the first miracles); for the apostle compareth
   these two things, the giving of the law and the gospel: Heb. ii. 2-4,
   For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression
   and disobedience received a just recompense of reward: how shall we
   escape if we neglect so great salvation, which at first began to be
   spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him?' we
   must be contented with God's owning it now only in the way of his
   Spirit and providence.

   3. That upon the ceasing of miracles, or their growing to be
   unnecessary, we have the more cause to suspect them who will revive
   this pretence of a power to work miracles; especially after we are
   cautioned against these delusions, as here in the text against the
   lying wonders of Antichrist, and elsewhere: Mat. xxiv. 24, For there
   shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show great
   signs and wonders, insomuch, that if it were possible, they shall
   deceive the very elect;' and again, Rev. xiii. 13, He doth great
   wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven upon earth in the
   sight of men.' But herein they triumph, when did they ever pretend to
   do so? Ans. This is not to be taken literally, for the whole chapter is
   mystical; none can be so ignorant that Antichrist shall arise as a
   beast out of the sea, with seven heads and ten horns; therefore, to
   fetch fire from heaven is only an allusion to Elias, that he should
   pretend to work miracles, as did Elias, who brought fire from heaven, 1
   Kings xviii. 24; and yet, in the letter, it was fulfilled in Pope
   Hildebrand, or Gregory VII., as one Paulus, who wrote his life,
   testifieth, who mentioneth divers wonders of fire wrought by him, and
   sundry times resembles him to Elias. The meaning is, he shall make his
   followers as confident of their errors as if they saw fire come from
   heaven to confirm them. But to return. We being thus cautioned and
   forewarned, miracles thus performed are deceitful. But you will say,
   though miracles are not necessary to confirm the faith, yet they are
   necessary to convince the falsehood of heresies. Ans. Heresies being a
   corruption of the faith once received, are to be confuted by arguments,
   not miracles; by evidence of doctrine, not wonders: partly lest the
   people be deceived by magical impostures, for it requireth some skill
   to distinguish true miracles from those that are deceitful, and done by
   the power of the devil; partly because verum est index sui et
   obliqui--faith stated and confirmed showeth what is error; so that to
   confute error by miracles is nothing but to confirm truth by miracles.

   4. Whosoever teach false doctrine, not consonant to the truth of
   scriptures, or that faith of Christ which was confirmed by miracles,
   their wonders are lying wonders, and, how plausible soever they seem,
   are lying wonders, and not to be believed. Surely miracles must needs
   be false and pretended which are brought to confirm a doctrine contrary
   to that which is already confirmed by miracles; for God is faithful,
   and cannot deny himself, and therefore he cannot be the author of
   miracles whereby things contrary to each other may be confirmed. If the
   faith once be established by other miracles, we are to believe the
   latter miracles to be a mere imposture; for Christ is not yea, and nay,
   but yea, and Amen,' 1 Cor. i. 19, 20. The apparition of an angel is a
   great miracle, but if an angel preach any other gospel unto you than
   that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed,' Gal. i. 8.
   It is a supposition of an impossible case, necessary to forewarn the
   people of God against the delusions of the devil, changing himself into
   an angel of light. Surely God will never contradict himself.

   5. The miracles wrought by Antichrist and his adherents are mira, but
   not miracula, some wonderful things, but no true and proper miracles;
   else, as Austin saith, Figmenta mendacium hominum, portenta fallacium
   spirituum--either the fictions of lying men, or the illusions of
   deceiving spirits. Many times the matter of fact is not true; at other
   times the thing done is but some illusion of the senses by the devil,
   or something taken for a miracle which doth not exceed the power of
   nature. Either way it is an imposture; and, indeed, the miracles of the
   legends are so false, so ridiculous, so light and trivial, that they
   expose Christianity to contempt; or else, if there be any thing in it,
   it giveth suspicions of magical illusion and converse with the devil
   which, among their votaries and recluses, is no unusual thing.

   6. There are seven points in Popery which they seek to confirm by
   miracles; and which, being senseless in themselves, do most scandalise
   Protestants.

   [1.] Pilgrimages. They show the shrine, and also the chamber of the
   house of the blessed Virgin; how the Virgin at Loretto was transported
   out of Galilee into Dalmatia, and by angels in the air, to the remote
   parts of Italy, and settled there after some removes.

   The story is ridiculous, and I am serious; yet this draweth an infinite
   company of pilgrims there, where new miracles are pretended to be
   wrought continually.

   [2.] Prayers for the dead. Bellarmine allegeth, out of Gregory, the
   miraculous apparition of Paschal's ghost, beseeching St Germanus to
   pray for him.

   [3.] Purgatory^ All their miracles are framed especially for the
   establishing of this point, which is of such gain to them; as that a
   dead man's skull spake to Mercarias praying, When thou dost offer
   prayer for the dead, then do we feel a little consolation.'

   [4.] The invocation of saints. Alypius, a grammarian, being forsaken of
   his physicians, St Tiola appeared to him by night, demanding what he
   ailed, or what he would have? He answered (to show a touch of his art)
   in Achilles's speech to his mother Thetis, in Homer, &c. Thou knowest;
   why should I tell thee that knowest all?' Where upon she conveyed a
   round stone to him, with the touch of which he was presently healed.

   [5.] The adoration of images, but especially of the cross, crucifix,
   and image of Christ. Malvenda saith, that at Meliapore, in the East
   Indies, where St Thomas was killed by those barbarous people, digging,
   to lay a foundation, they found a square stone, in it a bloody cross,
   and an inscription implying the saint was slain in the very act of
   adoring and kissing the cross; hereupon on went the building, and the
   chapel being finished, in the beginning of the gospel, in sight of the
   whole multitude, the cross did sweat abundantly; the sweat wiped off,
   drops of blood appeared in the linen with which they wiped it, till at
   length it returned to its own colour.

   [6.] The adoration of the host is made good by such a number of
   miracles as fill whole volumes. Bellarmine himself telleth us of a
   hungry mare, kept three days without meat, yet when provender was
   poured to her in the presence of the host, she, forgetting her meat,
   with bowed head and bended knees adored the sacrament.

   [7.] The primacy of the Pope hath been the beginning and is the end of
   all popish legends. A bishop, being excommunicated by Pope Hildebrand,
   and inveighing against his pride, was smitten with a thunderclap.
   Baronius relates, that while Pope Eugenius the Third was celebrating
   the mass, a beam of the sun shone upon his head, in which were seen two
   doves, ascending and descending, which an Eastern legate seeing,
   submitted instantly to the primacy.

   Use. Another note of Antichrist: these impostures are not only
   countenanced and encouraged in that church, but made a mark of it. The
   power of miracles: When Antichrist first appeared, ridiculous miracles
   of all sorts began to be cried up and established; yea, and to this
   day, these are pleaded, challenging us for the want of them. What they
   cannot prove by the oracles of God, they endeavour to prove by miracles
   of Satan.

SERMON VIII.

   With all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because
   they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.--2
   Thes. II. 10.

   WE have described unto you the head of the antichristian state; we come
   now to the subjects, especially the zealous abettors and promoters of
   this kingdom. They are described:--(1.) By the means how they are drawn
   into this apostasy and defection, en pase apate tes adikias. (2.) By
   their doom or misery; they are in a state of perdition: in them that
   perish. (3.) By their sin, which is the cause and reason of this doom:
   because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be
   saved.

   1. The means: With all deceivableness of unrighteousness.' That
   Antichrist shall be a deceiver, and that he deceiveth by lying
   miracles, we have seen already, and is foretold: Rev. xiii. 14, And
   deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles
   which he had power to do in the sight of the beast,' &c.; but the
   deceived are not altogether guiltless, for the fraud would soon be
   discovered by a holy and pure soul. His great engine is either the
   baits of lust and sin, which work on none but those that have pleasure
   in unrighteousness, ver. 12: the generality of wicked and carnal
   Christians are easily drawn from God's pure worship, and true
   godliness; either by worldly means, as by the offers of preferment,
   riches, dignities, or else terrors of the flesh. Now, none catch at
   these worldly baits but whose eyes the god of this world hath blinded,
   2 Cor. iv. 4.

   2. Their misery: they are said to be those that perish.' That beareth
   three senses:--(1.) That they are worthy to perish, because they do not
   use care and diligence to understand their duty, being blinded by their
   worldly affections. That is the mildest sense we can put upon it; they
   deserve to perish. No man perisheth but for his own fault: Hosea xiii.
   9, O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thy help.' Now,
   they that will yield to the deceivableness of unrighteousness, justly
   perish; though there be deceit in the case, yet there is
   unrighteousness in the case also. Fraudulent dealing should not so
   cozen us, as apparent unrighteousness or unfaithfulness to Christ
   should warn us. (2.) That they are in an actual state of perdition,
   and, unless they come out of it, are undone for ever. The apostles,
   when they propounded Christian doctrine, at first did use this term to
   distinguish impenitent unbelievers from those that received the gospel:
   as 1 Cor. i. 18, The preaching of the cross is to them that perish
   foolishness, but unto us that are saved the power of God:' so 2 Cor.
   ii. 15, We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that perish,
   and in them that are saved.' So he distinguished them that receive the
   faith, and them that receive it not; penitent believers are those that
   are saved, but impenitent unbelievers are those that perish, that is,
   are for the present, during their infidelity and impenitency, in an
   actual state of perdition; so 2 Cor. iv. 3, If our gospel be hid, it is
   hid to those that are lost;' that is, who are for the present in a lost
   condition. We know not God's secret decrees, but those that refuse and
   oppose the only remedy, to all appearance, are lost men. Now, this he
   applieth to those that yield to Antichrist, showing them that though
   they are Christians, yet they have no more benefit by the gospel than
   infidels; they receive not the truth--these revolt from the owning of
   it upon carnal reasons: and therefore it is foretold, Rev. xiv. 9, 10,
   If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his
   forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wrath of God,
   which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;
   and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of
   the holy angels, and the presence of the Lamb;' that is, all those that
   give up themselves as servants and soldiers to the antichristian
   estate, and obstinately adhere to and promote that profession, they
   shall taste of the Mediator's vengeance, which will be very sore and
   severe: Luke xix. 27, These mine enemies, which would not that I should
   reign over them, bring them forth, and slay them before me,' Popery is
   the highway to damnation. (3.) It beareth this sense, that they are
   fore-appointed to perish who are left to these delusions; they are such
   as God hath passed by, and not chosen to life. This is to be considered
   also; for damnable errors take not effect on God's elect: Mat. xxiv.
   24, If it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.' The elect
   cannot altogether be seduced and drawn away from Christ, for God taketh
   them into his protection, and guardeth them against the delusions of
   false prophets, that, if they be for a time, they shall not always be
   deceived. So it is said, Rev. ix. 4, The locusts shall hurt none of
   those that had the seal of God in their foreheads.' The delusions of
   Antichrist have only their full effect on those who are not elected and
   sealed, upon the hypocritical professors that live in the visible
   church. So it is said again, Rev. xiii. 8, All that dwell upon the
   earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the Lamb's book
   of life;' and again, Rev. xvii. 8, And they that dwell on the earth
   shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the
   foundation of the world.' The elect are still excepted, which is much
   for the comfort of the godly, who belong to God's election, that he
   shall not prevail over them totally, finally. God hath chosen you to
   life.

   3. The reason of this doom: Because they received not the love of the
   truth that they might be saved.' By the truth is meant the gospel, the
   chief truth revealed in God's word, and the only means of salvation:
   Eph. i. 13, In whom also ye trusted, after that ye heard the word of
   truth, the gospel of your salvation.' This is the truth most profitable
   to lost sinners; receiving is put for entertaining, or believing the
   word; as Acts viii. 14, When they heard that Samaria had received the
   word of God;' and Acts xi. 1, That the Gentiles had received the word,'
   and elsewhere. This reception must be with love: Acts ii. 41, As many
   as received the word gladly;' and Acts xvii. 11, They received the word
   with readiness of mind.' And this affection must produce its effect, so
   as to convert them unto God. Now, this is denied of them who are
   seduced by Antichrist, that they ever had any true love to the truth,
   or minded it in order to their salvation. Now, the business is, whether
   the clause concerned only the Jews, or can be applied to Christians?
   The Jews clearly received not the love of the truth, but did refuse
   Christ and his salvation. And herein the papists glory of an advantage
   of turning off this prophecy from themselves. But the apostle speaketh
   not of rejecting the truth, but of not receiving the love of the truth,
   which is not proper to the Jews but to false Christians. The Jews'
   company rejected Christ, and Antichrist was not sent to them for a
   punishment, but wrath came upon them to the uttermost, to the excision
   and cutting off their nation. But here is rendered the reason not of
   other judgments, but why men are captives to Antichrist. Therefore it
   is not so to be confined.

   Doct. 1. The subjects of Antichrist's power and seduction are those
   that perish.

   2. The great reason why God sent this judgment on the Christian world,
   is because they received not the love of the truth.

   Doct. 1. That the subjects of Antichrist's power and seduction are
   those that perish.

   It is a dreadful argument we are upon, yet necessary to be known for
   our caution, however to be handled warily. (1.) It is certainly more
   meet for us to have a regard of our own estate, than curiously to
   inquire what becometh of others. The apostle waiveth judging them that
   are without, 1 Cor. v. 12. I know he meaneth it of the censures of the
   church, which are not exercised upon infidels, but Christians; but so
   far we may apply it to this case, that we should not rashly judge of
   the eternal state of other persons, but rather of things wherein our
   selves are concerned. If the inquiry were only matter of curiosity,
   surely Christ's rebuke would silence it, What is that to thee?' John
   xxi. 22; for Christ is ill pleased with curiosity about the state of
   other men; but it is fit we should know our own duty and danger, and to
   that end it must be discussed. (2.) That there is a great difficulty of
   the salvation of papists so living and dying, if not an utter
   impossibility. Partly because, though it should be supposed that they
   retain the foundation, yet they build such hay and stubble upon it, so
   many errors in doctrine, corruptions in worship, and tyranny in
   government, that if a man could be saved, he is saved but as by fire, 1
   Cor. iii. 13; and no man that hath a care of his soul will either
   embrace Popery or continue in it. Where the way is plainest there are
   difficulties enough, and the righteous are scarcely saved; and,
   therefore, in a questionable way, none should venture. Worshipping of
   angels and saints departed, and images, are no light thing. Nor will a
   serious Christian choose that way where the doctrines of the gospel are
   so exceedingly corrupted, and there is such a manifest invasion of the
   authority of Christ, by challenging a universal headship over his
   church without his leave, and this maintained by errors and
   persecutions. (3.) We must distinguish of those that lived under
   Popery, rather as captives under this tyranny, than voluntary subjects
   of this kingdom of Antichrist; as many holy men did in former times,
   groaning and mourning under the abominations, rather than countenancing
   and promoting them. To these God speaketh when he saith, Rev. xviii. 4,
   Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and
   that ye receive not of her plagues.' They were his people while they
   were there. These were as those seven thousand in Israel that had not
   bowed the knee to Baal.' Rom. xi. 4. (4.) There is a difference to be
   put between those that err in the simplicity of their hearts, knowing
   no better, and those that withstand the light upon carnal reasons, and
   will not retract their errors, though convinced of the degeneration of
   Christianity; for simple ignorance is not so damning as obstinate
   error: Luke xii. 48, But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy
   of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes,' &c.; and 1 Tim. i. 13,
   But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.' The
   scriptures many times condemn a way as a way of ruin, but all in that
   way are not damned; as John iv, 22, Salvation is of the Jews.' There it
   is eminently dispensed, and yet therefore it followeth not that all the
   Samaritans were damned. Some among them, though tainted with the errors
   of their country, might have such knowledge of the law of God, and love
   to him, as might be effectual to salvation. (5.) We must distinguish
   between papists so living and so dying; many, by God's grace, may have
   repentance conferred upon them at death; and though they lived papists,
   might die as reformed Christians, seeking salvation by Christ alone, in
   the way of true faith and repentance, and so the Lord may manifest his
   compassion to them, pardoning the errors of their lives. (6.) We must
   distinguish times. God might dispense with many in the times of
   universal darkness and captivity, more than he doth afterwards, when
   the light of the gospel breaketh forth, and his trumpet is sounded to
   call them forth. Whosoever shall compare John Fierus and John Calvin
   will find they were assisted by the same Holy Spirit of God, though the
   one lived and died a papist, and the other was an eminent instrument in
   reforming the church of God; but an ignorant fear of separation from
   the catholic church caused many to do as they did; but much more doth
   it hold good in the times before. Our fathers, if alive, would not have
   condemned us, nor should we condemn them, being dead, before they had
   these advantages which we now enjoy. Illi si reviviscerent, &c., saith
   Austin in a like case. (7.) We must distinguish between Popish errors:
   some are more capital, as adoration of images, invocation of saints,
   justification by the merit of works, inhibition of the scriptures, &c.;
   others not so deadly, as when too much reverence is given to
   ecclesiastical orders and constitutions, penance, auricular confession,
   fasting, &c. Now though the case of a real papist, who is complete in
   this mystery of iniquity, and refuseth, hateth, persecuteth the truth
   offered, be desperate, yet the Lord may in tender mercy accept of other
   devout souls who yet live in that way, if they hold the head and the
   foundation.

   Use 1. Let us not think Popery a light thing, which the Lord so
   peremptorily threateneth. Surely it is no little mercy that we are
   freed from it. Therefore we should be thankful for the light we have,
   and improve it well while we have it, and hold it fast. What hope
   soever we may have of men living in former times, and foreign
   countries, where they know no better, but after such express warnings,
   what hope can we have of English papists, considering the time, when
   Rome is not grown better but worse, and what was common opinion is now
   made an article of faith, and when the truth is taught and so clearly
   manifested; so that for any, by their own voluntary choice, to run into
   Popery, is a plain defection from Christ to Antichrist, and wilfully to
   drink that poison which will be the bane and ruin of their souls!

   Doct. 2. The great reason why God sent this judgment upon the Christian
   world, is to punish those that received not the love of the truth.

   Here I shall inquire--(1.) How many ways men may be said not to receive
   the love of the truth. (2.) How just their punishment is for such a
   sin.

   [1.] In stating this sin--(1.) It is supposed that the truth and
   doctrine of Christ is made known to a people; yea, cometh among them
   with great evidence, conviction, and authority. For it is not the want
   of means, but want of love, that it is charged on them; and the plenty
   of means aggravateth their fault, and maketh their condemnation the
   more just: John iii. 19, This is the condemnation, that light is come
   into the world, and men loved darkness more than light.' The truth was
   not for their turns, but was contrary to their lusts, and passions, and
   prejudices; and these they preferred before the light of the gospel
   shining to them.

   (2.) That as in evidence of doctrine was not the cause of not receiving
   the truth, so not bare weakness of understanding. No; it is not
   weakness, but wilfulness which is here intimated; not a defect of their
   minds, but their hearts: John viii. 45, Because I tell you the truth,
   ye believe me not.' It was not weakness but prejudice hindered their
   believing. They despised the grace of God; yea, hated it for their
   lust's sake. Their lusts lie more in opposition to the truth than
   speculative doubts and errors: Luke xvi. 14, And the pharisees, who
   were covetous, when they heard all these things, derided him;' the
   words are, blew their noses at him.' The sensual, carnal, and ungodly
   world scorneth heavenly doctrine, and pure Christianity is distasted by
   false Christians. Err in mind, err in heart.

   (3.) It is not enough to receive the truth in the light of it, but we
   must also receive it in the love of it, or it will do us no good. To
   make the truth operative:--(1.) Knowledge is necessary, and also faith,
   and then love. Knowledge, for without knowledge the heart is not good,'
   Prov. xix. 2. Nothing can come to the heart but by the mind; the will
   is o'rexis meta` lo'gon--a choice or desire, guided by reason, and the
   gospel doth not work as a charm, whether it be or be not under stood.
   No; the purport or drift of it must be known, or how can it have any
   effect upon us? Next to knowledge, to make it work, there must be
   faith. When we apprehend a thing, we must judge of it, whether it be
   true or false; how else can it make any challenge, or lay claim to our
   respect? 1 Thes. ii. 13, Ye received it not as the word of men, but (as
   it is in truth) the word of God, which worketh effectually in you, as
   it doth in all them that believe.' Faith doth enliven our actions about
   religion; to hear of God, and Christ, and heaven, doth not stir us
   unless we believe these things. Well, next to faith there must be love,
   for apprehension and dijudication are acts of the understanding only,
   but love belongeth to the will, and we must believe with all the heart,
   Acts viii. 37. There may be knowledge without faith, as an heathen may
   understand the Christian religion, though he believe it not, profess it
   not. And there may be faith without love, for there is a dead faith,'
   James ii. 20, which rests in cold opinions, without any affection to
   the truth believed. Love pierceth deeper into the truth, and maketh it
   pierce deeper into us. As a red-hot iron, though never so blunt, will
   run farther into an inch board than a cold tool, though never so sharp.
   And love maketh it more operative; there is notitia per visum, et
   notitia per gustum--a knowledge by sight, and a knowledge by taste. A
   man may guess at the goodness of wine by the colour, but more by the
   taste; that is a more refreshing apprehension; and Augustine prayeth,
   Fac me, Domine, gustare per amorem quod gusto per cognitionem--Lord,
   make me taste that by love which I taste by knowledge. Surely we are
   never sound in Christianity till all the light that we receive be
   turned into love. These great things are revealed and represented to
   our faith, not to please our minds by knowing them, but to quicken our
   love. Faith alone is but as sight, and faith with love is as taste.
   Now, it is more easy to dispute a man out of his belief that only
   seeth, than it is him that tasteth, and knoweth the grace of God in
   truth. This is the true reason of the stedfastness of weak and
   unlearned Christians; though they have not such distinct conceptions
   and reasonings as many learned men have, yet their faith is turned into
   love, and a man is better held by the heart than by the head. And
   though they cannot dispute for Christ (as one of the martyrs said),
   they can die for Christ. But alas! many receive the truth in the light
   thereof, but few receive it in the love of it, and so lie open to
   deceit.

   (4.) This love must not be a slight affection, for that will soon
   vanish; but we must be rooted and well grounded, and have a good
   strength.' The stony ground had some love to the word: Mat. xiii. 20,
   21, But he that receiveth the seed in stony places, the same is he that
   heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it: yet he hath not root
   in himself, but dureth but a while; for when tribulation or persecution
   riseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.' So also of the
   thorny ground: He heareth the word, and the care of this world, and the
   deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful,'
   ver. 22. Now what are the defects of this love? (1.) It is not
   radicated--a pang of love or flash of zeal; whereas we should be rooted
   and grounded in love.' Eph. iii. 17. Hypocrites had a taste: Heb. vi.
   4, 5, For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and
   have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy
   Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
   world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto
   repentance.' Tasted, but did but taste; did escape mia'smata ko'smou, 2
   Peter ii. 20; yet, not having a good conscience, may make shipwreck of
   faith, 1 Tim. i. 19. (2.) It is partial. The gospel offereth great
   privileges, and it is also a pure, holy rule of obedience, Acts ii. 41.
   The word of God is made up of precepts and promises. God offereth in
   the covenant excellent benefits, upon gracious terms and conditions:
   there must be a consent to the terms, as well as an acceptation of the
   privileges. The confidence of the privileges serveth to wean us from
   the false happiness, therefore that must be kept up: Heb. iii. 6, But
   Christ, as a son over his own house, whose are we, if we hold fast the
   confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.' And the
   consent to the terms bindeth our duty upon us, Isa. lvi. 4. Now as
   willingly as we yielded at first, we must keep up the same fervour
   still: Deut. v. 29, Oh, that there were such an heart in them, that
   they would fear me and keep all my commandments always; that it might
   be well with them and with their children for ever.' But whole, pure
   Christianity is not loved by false Christians; therefore, when religion
   crosseth their interests and the bent of their lusts, they seek to
   bring religion to their hearts, not their hearts to religion. (3.) It
   is not strong, and in such a prevalent degree as to control other
   affections; it is but a passion, a pleasure, and a delight they take on
   for a time, not the effect of solid judgment and resolution a joy
   easily controlled and overcome with other delights; therefore Christ
   requireth a denial of all things, for a close adherence to him and his
   doctrine, and hath told us, Mat. x. 37, He that loveth father and
   mother more than me, is not worthy of me,' and Luke xiv. 26, cannot be
   my disciple.' This is a love to which all other loves must give way and
   be subordinate. Many love the truth a little, but love other things
   more, will be at no cost for it. Solomon giveth advice, Prov. xxiii.
   23, Buy the truth and sell it not.' In lesser points we must do nothing
   against the truth, for though the matter contended for be never so
   small, yet sincerity is a great point; but in the greater truths we
   should purchase the knowledge of them at any rate, and be faithful to
   Christ whatever it costs us. (4.) This slight love may arise from
   worldly respects. Now in the text it is said, They received not the
   love of the truth, that they might be saved.' It should arise upon
   eternal reasons and considerations of the other world, which only
   produce abiding affections: Heb. x. 39, We are not of them that draw
   back to perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.'
   In closing with Christianity, that must be fixed as our scope, not to
   spare the flesh, but to save the soul, and to save the soul with the
   loss of other things; and that will make us true to Christ. But there
   are many foreign reasons for which men may show some love to religion.
   As, first, policy; as Jehu took up Jehonadab into the chariot with him,
   2 Kings x. 15 there is his compliment to him. Jehonadab was a good man,
   and this honoured him before the people, to see Jehu and Jehonadab so
   well acquainted. Sometimes respect to others upon whom we depend Many
   seem to be good because they dare not displease others that have
   authority over them, or an interest in them; as Joash was religious all
   the days of Jehoiada, for he stood in awe of him, 2 Chron. xxiv. 2. Now
   such sorry religion dependeth on foreign accidents, the life of others
   or presence of others, and therefore it cannot be durable; whereas, in
   presence or absence, we should work out our salvation with fear and
   trembling,' Phil. ii. 12; otherwise men only keep within compass for a
   while, but they have the root of sin within them still. Or it may be
   novelty, as our Lord telleth the Jews, John was a burning and shining
   light, and ye were willing to rejoice in his light for a season,' John
   was an eminent man for pureness of doctrine and vigour of zeal, and the
   more corrupt sort of Jews, pharisees as well as others, admired him for
   a while, but they soon grew weary of him--it was a fit of zeal for the
   present. Lastly, This love may be to the excellency of gifts bestowed
   upon some minister or instrument whom God raiseth up, or some
   countenance of great men given to their ministry may stir up some love
   and attendance on their ministry; and some respect is given for their
   sakes when men have no sound grace in their hearts. There is a
   receiving of the word as the word of man, and a receiving of the word
   as the word of God, as the apostle intimateth, 1 Thes. ii. 13. The
   receiving of the word as the word of man, so it worketh only a human
   passion, a delight in the gifts of the ministry used: Ezek. xxxiii. 32,
   Thou art to them as a lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice.'
   Then there is a receiving it as the word of God, and then we receive it
   with much assurance and joy in the Holy Ghost: 1 Thes. i. 5, Our gospel
   came to you, not in word, but in power, and much assurance, and joy in
   the Holy Ghost.' Now if we do not receive the truth upon God's
   recommendation and confirmation, we do not love truth as truth; our
   contest is not who hath most wit and parts, but most grace. (5.) They
   do not receive the love of the truth, when it doth not produce its
   solid effects, which is a change of heart and life, and they are not
   brought by the gospel to a sincere repentance and conversion to God, or
   receive the truth so as to live by it; but whilst they have the names
   of Christians, have the lives and hearts of atheists and infidels.
   These were those that debauched Christianity, and meritoriè and
   effectivè, by their provocations and negligence, brought this
   degeneracy into the church and judgment on the Christian world.
   Certainly a man hateth that religion which he doth profess when he will
   not live by it. This perfidiousness and breach of covenant was that
   which provoked God to permit these delusions in the church; the
   worldly, sensual, carnal Christians, that hate that life which their
   religion calleth for. The godly Christian and the carnal Christian have
   the same Bible, the same creed, the same baptism, yet they hate one
   another as if they were of different religions, and confound the
   distinction between the world and the church, because the world is in
   the church. And of sensual and godless men we must speak as heathens,
   as if they were without God: they abhor that religion which they do
   profess; that is, they abhor not the name, but they abhor those that
   are faithful to it and serious in it, who desire to know God in Christ,
   and desire to love him, and live to him. It was that Christ taxed in
   the pharisees; they honoured the dead saints and abhorred the living:
   Mat. xxiii. 29-31, Woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
   because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres
   of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers,
   we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
   prophets. Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
   children of them which killed the prophets.' Christ hath not worse
   enemies in the world than those that usurp his name, and pretend to be
   his officers, and yet eat and drink with the drunken, and beat their
   fellow-servants, Mat. xxiv. 49. Christ will disown such at the day of
   judgment: Mat. vii. 22, 23, Many will say unto me in that day, Lord,
   Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out
   devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I
   profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work
   iniquity.' And such do most dishonour him in the world. A righteous,
   sober, godly life is the best evidence of our love to the truth.

   [2.] How just this punishment is:--(1.) Because God hath ever held this
   course on the pagan world, who kept not the natural knowledge of God:
   He gave them up to vile affections,' Rom. i. 28. The Jews who rejected
   Christ: John v. 43, I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me
   not: another will come in his own name, and him will ye receive.' When
   Christ cometh merely for our benefit, the unthankful world will not
   make him welcome, but they will take worse in his room. So towards
   Christians. At first men would not receive the gospel while it was pure
   and in its simplicity, as taught by Christ and his apostles, and sealed
   by the blood of the martyrs, till it was backed by a worldly interest,
   and corrupted into a worldly design; and then they had it and all
   manner of superstitions together, and with these strong delusions there
   came just damnation. So still the pure gospel is refused, and God
   sendeth popish seducers as a just judgment; men only prize the light as
   it may serve their turn. (2.) The neglect and contempt of the truth is
   so heinous a sin that it deserveth the greatest punishment: Heb. ii. 3,
   How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?' Now it is
   revenged by these errors as a just judgment on the perverseness and
   unthankfulness of the world. The duties of the gospel being so
   unquestionable, shows their perverseness. The privileges of the gospel
   being so excellent, their unthankfulness is more intolerable.

   Use 1 is to show us what cause we have to fear a return of Popery.
   Alas! where is this love of the truth? (1.) Some are gospel-glutted,
   loathe manna: a full-fed people must expect a famine, Amos viii. 2. In
   differences between God and Baal, Christ and Antichrist, few are
   valiant for the truth: Jer. ix. 3, And they bend their tongue like
   their bow for lies, but they are not valiant for the truth upon the
   earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith
   the Lord.' Contend earnestly: Jude 3, It was needful for me to write
   unto you, and to exhort you, that you should earnestly contend for the
   faith which was once delivered unto the saints.' Again (2.) There are
   many sensualists, unclean and carnal gospellers; to these God oweth a
   judgment. Usually the gospel is removed and given to a nation that will
   bring forth the fruits thereof. They that use the truth only or
   principally for their own turns, hate to be reformed; God will reckon
   with them: Ps. l. 16, 17, But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou
   to do to declare my statutes? or that thou shouldst take my covenant
   into thy mouth, seeing thou Latest instruction, and castest my words
   behind thee?'

   Use 2 shows you indeed that you love the gospel. [2] Carentia remedii
   is a grievous misery, or else Christ had not come as a great blessing.
   Neglectus remedii is a grievous sin, to be lazy in a matter of such
   moment: those that never set their hearts to obey the truth. Crassa
   negligentia dolus est: There should be constant purpose, endeavour,
   striving, and not cease striving, till we in some measure prevail.
   Rejectio or contemptio remedii, if we put away the word of God from us:
   Acts xiii. 46, Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was
   necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you;
   but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of
   everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.' God will be gone, if
   not from the land, from thy soul. This is the most heinous iniquity of
   all: Heb. x. 28, 29, He that despised Moses' law died without mercy
   under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,
   shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God,
   and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
   sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of
   grace?' So Esau's despising his birth right: Heb. xii. 16, 17, Lest
   there be any fornicator or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel
   of meat sold his birthright; for ye know Low that afterwards, when he
   would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no
   place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.'

SERMON IX.

   And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
   should believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not
   the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.--2 Thes. II. 11, 12.

   WE have considered the sin of those seduced by Antichrist; now the
   judgment. It is twofold:--(1.) Delusion in this world, ver. 11; (2.)
   Damnation in the next, ver. 12.

   1. Delusion in this world; where take notice of three things:--

   (1.) The author of it: God shall send it; (2.) The degree or nature of
   the punishment: strong delusion; (3.) The issue of it: that they should
   believe a lie.

   2. Their punishment in the next world: that they all might be damned
   who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness; where
   take notice:--(1.) Of the terribleness of it, it is no less than
   everlasting damnation: krithosin for katakrithosi; (2.) The justice and
   equity of it: They believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
   unrighteousness.'

   1. I begin with their judgment in this world: For this cause God shall
   send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie.'

   Doct. That by God's just judgment there is an infatuation upon the
   followers and abettors of Antichrist, that they swallow the grossest
   errors to their own destruction.

   To clear this I shall speak:--(1.) To the author; (2.) The degree or
   kind of the punishment; (3.) The effect and issue.

   1. As to the author: pempsei autois ho Theos. Here a difficulty
   ariseth; for God is not, and cannot be, the author of sin. He that is
   essentially good cannot be the cause of evil; and he that is ultor
   peccati, the avenger of sin, cannot be auctor peccati, the author of
   it. If he should cause man to sin, how will his punishment of it be
   just? I answer--As it is a sin, God hath no hand in it; but as it is a
   punishment of sin, God hath to do in it.

   To clear this to you, consider--

   [1.] He that is the supreme Lord and Governor of his creatures is also
   their Judge; for legislation and judgment belong to the same authority.
   And therefore God is called sometimes our King, and some times our
   Judge: Gen. xviii. 25, Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?'
   Rom. iii. 5, 6, Is God unrighteous? how then shall he judge the world?'
   That is his office and prerogative.

   [2.] God's way of judging for the present is either external or
   internal. As, for instance, there are two acts of judicature reward and
   punishment. In rewarding, God's external government is seen in
   dispensing outward blessings to his people, as the fruit of their
   obedience: Micah ii. 7, Do not my words do good to him that walketh
   uprightly?' His promises speak good, and as fulfilled do good, yield
   protection, maintenance, and such a measure of outward prosperity as
   supporteth and maintaineth them during their service. David owned God's
   dealing with him in this sort: Ps. cxix. 56, This I had, because I kept
   thy precepts.' So as to his internal government, in giving them peace
   of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost: Rom. xiv. 17, For the kingdom
   of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in
   the Holy Ghost;' Prov. iii. 17, Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and
   all her paths are peace.' These are the internal rewards of obedience.
   And so also God often rewardeth grace with grace; as Isa. lviii. 13,
   14, If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy
   pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of
   the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour him, not doing thy own ways, nor
   finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words, then shalt
   thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon
   the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob
   thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it;' Ps. xxxi. 24, Be
   of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope
   in the Lord,' Proficiency in the same grace is a reward of the several
   acts and exercise of it. So in punishing, sometimes he useth the way of
   external government, by the terrible judgments exercised upon men for
   the breach of his law: Rom. i. 18, For the wrath of God is revealed
   from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who
   hold the truth in unrighteousness:' Heb. ii. 2, Every transgression and
   disobedience received a just recompense of reward;' sometimes the way
   of internal government, by terrors of conscience, or punishing sin
   committed with sin permitted. Both these parts are seen in punishing
   both the godly and the wicked; as, for in stance, in the godly, in the
   way of external government: 1 Cor. xi. 32, But when we are judged, we
   are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the
   world.' In the way of internal government, the lesser penal
   withdrawings of the Spirit, which God's people find in themselves after
   some sins and neglects of grace, are grievous. But the judgments upon
   the souls of the ungodly are most dreadful, when the sinner is either
   terrified or stupefied; terrified by horrors of conscience: 1 Cor. xv.
   56, The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law;' or
   stupefied by being given up to their own hearts' counsels: Ps. lxxxi.
   12, So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts, and they walked in
   their own counsels.' So that the sinner is left dull and senseless and
   past feeling: Eph. iv. 18, Having the understanding darkened, being
   alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them,
   because of the blindness of their heart.' By the first, by horrors of
   conscience, they are made to feel God's displeasure at the courses they
   walk in; but when that is long despised, and men sin on still, then the
   other and more terrible judgment cometh; for the giving up a sinner to
   his own lusts, and his losing all remorse, is the last and sorest
   judgment on this side hell.

   [3.] As to God's internal judgments, the scripture chiefly insists upon
   two parts of this internal dispensation--blindness of mind and hardness
   of heart; they usually go together. Blindness of mind is spoken of,
   John xii. 39, 40, Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias
   said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts; that
   they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart,
   and be converted, and I should heal them.' All passages are obstructed
   whereby the word might enter and work conversion unto God. It was God
   laid this punishment of blindness upon them. Hardness of heart, in that
   famous instance, Exod. iv. 21, I will harden Pharaoh's heart.' God doth
   not make them that see, blind, nor them that are soft, hard; but
   leaveth them to their own prejudice, obstinacy, and unpersuadableness,
   and that when highly provoked. The former is under our consideration.

   [4.] To understand God's concurrence as a judge, we must not say too
   much of it or too little. We must not say too much of it, lest we leave
   a stain and blemish upon the divine glory. God infuseth no sin-, no
   blindness nor hardness, into the hearts of men; all influences from
   heaven are good: he conveyeth no deceit into the minds of men
   immediately, nor doth he command or persuade men to oppose the truth.
   Nor doth he impel or excite their inward propensions so to do. All this
   belongeth not to God, but either to man or Satan. Nor must we say too
   little; as, for instance, God is not said to blind or harden; by bare
   prescience or foresight, that they will be blinded or hardened; because
   God foreseeth other things, and yet they are not ascribed unto God; as
   that men will kill, or steal, or do wrong, and yet God is not said to
   kill or steal, as he is said to blind and harden; and therefore there
   is a difference between God's concurrence to this effect and other
   sins. Nor only by way of manifestation, as if this were all the sense,
   that in the course of his providence God doth in the issue declare how
   blind and hard they are. That some other thing is meant by it is seen
   in the prayers by which we deprecate this heavy judgment. As when the
   saints pray, Isa. lxiii. 17, Lord, harden not our hearts from thy
   fear;' or David, Ps. cxix. 19, Lord, hide not thy commandments from
   me.' They mean not thus, Lord, show not to the world how hard and blind
   I am, but cure my blindness and hardness of heart; keep back this
   judgment from me. Again, we must not say that all that God doth is a
   bare, naked, and idle permission, as if it happened be sides his will
   and intention, and God had no more to do in it than a man that standeth
   on the shore and seeth a ship ready to be drowned: he might have helped
   it, but permitted it. No; besides all this, there is not a bare
   permission only, but a permissive intention and a judicial sentence,
   which is seconded by an active providence. Many things concur to the
   blinding of the mind and hardening of the heart, all which God willeth,
   but justly. The wicked take occasions of their own accord to blind and
   harden themselves. Satan tempteth of his own malice, but all this could
   not be done with effect and success without the will of God. There is a
   supreme power overruling, and ordering all that is done in the world.

   [5.] God's concurrence may be stated by these things:--

   (1.) His withdrawing or taking away the light and direction of his Holy
   Spirit: Deut. xxix. 4, The Lord hath not given you an heart to
   perceive, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear, unto this day.' Now, when
   God lets them loose to their own hearts' counsels, then they fall into
   damnable errors. A greyhound held in by a slip or collar runneth
   violently after the hare when it is in sight; as soon as the slip and
   collar are taken away, the restraint is gone, and his inbred
   disposition carrieth him. So men that are greedy of worldly things are
   powerfully drawn into errors countenanced by the world, when God taketh
   off the restraint of his grace, and giveth them up to their own lusts.
   Now herein God is not to be blamed, for he is debtor to none, and the
   grace of his Spirit is forfeited by their not receiving the love of the
   truth. He is so far from being bound to give grace, that he seemeth to
   be bound in justice to withdraw what is given already by men's
   wickedness and ingratitude. Voluntary blindness bringeth penal
   blindness; and because men will not see, they shall not see. And when
   they wink hard, and shut their eyes against the light of the gospel, it
   is just with God in this manner to smite them with blindness: and since
   they had no love to the truth, they are given up to errors and deceits.
   And because they despise the holy scriptures, and dote on vain fables,
   and would not take up a course of sound godliness and holiness, he
   suffereth them to weary themselves with sundry superstitions.

   (2.) Not only by desertion, but by tradition, delivering them up to the
   power of Satan: 2 Cor. iv. 4, The God of this world hath blinded their
   eyes.' Satan, as the executioner of God's curse, worketh upon the
   corrupt nature of man, and deceiveth them. It is said, 1 Chron. xxi. 1,
   Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel;'
   but it is said, 2 Sam. xxiv. 1, And the anger of the Lord was kindled
   against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number
   Israel and Judah.' How shall we reconcile these two places? God gave
   him over to be tempted by Satan--by God as a judge, by Satan as an
   executioner. Temptations to sin come immediately from the devil, but
   they are governed by God for holy and righteous ends. So again, 1 Kings
   xxii. 22, the evil spirit had leave and commission to be a lying spirit
   in Ahab's prophets: Go forth and do so, and thou shalt prevail with
   him.' There is a permissive intention, not an affective. When they
   grieve his Spirit, God withdraweth and leaveth them to the evil spirit,
   who works by their fleshly and worldly lusts, and then they are easily
   seduced who prefer worldly things before heavenly.

   (3.) There is an active providence which raiseth such instruments and
   propoundeth such objects as, meeting with a naughty heart, do sore
   blind it. (1.) For instruments: Job xii. 16, The deceived and the
   deceiver are his.' Take it in worldly, or take it in religious,
   matters, man's deceiving others, or being deceived by others, is of
   God; for it is said, both are his; not only as his creatures, but
   subject to the government and disposal of providence, how and whom they
   shall deceive, and how far they shall deceive. So Ezek. xiv. 9, If the
   prophet be deceived that hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived
   him.' This is a great transaction in the world, a sad judgment, not to
   be cavilled but trembled at. For man's ingratitude, God raiseth up
   false prophets to seduce them that delight in lies rather than in the
   truths of God. (2.) For objects: wicked instruments varnish and dress
   up this cause with all the art they can to make it a powerful deceit,
   and then it is befriended and countenanced by the powers of the world,
   and so easily prevaileth with them who are moved either with worldly
   hopes or fears, and have debauched their conscience by worldly
   respects. God saith, Jer. vi. 21, I will lay stumbling-blocks before
   this people.' If we will find the sin, God will find the occasion. If
   Judas hath a mind to sell his Master, he shall not want chapmen to
   bargain with him. The priests were consulting to destroy Christ at the
   same time that the devil put it into his heart, Mat. xxvi. 3, being
   alarmed by the miracle of raising Lazarus. Birds and fishes are easily
   deceived with such baits as they greedily catch at, so God by his just
   vengeance ordereth such occurrences and occasions as take with a
   naughty and carnal heart.

   2. The degree or kind of the punishment, energeian planes; we render it
   strong delusion,' or the efficacy of error;' that is, such delusion as
   shall have a most efficacious force to deceive them. The prevalency and
   strength of the delusion is seen in two things:--(1.) The absurdity of
   the errors; (2.) The obstinacy wherewith they cleave to them.

   [1.] The absurdity of the errors. I will instance in three
   things--False image worship and bread worship, invocation of saints,
   and supererogation of works.

   (1.) Adoration of images. Idolaters are usually represented as sottish;
   as Ps. cxv. 8, They that make them are like unto them; so is every one
   that trusteth in them.' He had described the senselessness of the idols
   before. They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
   see not; they have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they
   smell not, &c. Now as idols are senseless, so the idolaters are
   brutish; that is, the makers, worshippers, and servers of them, are as
   void of true wisdom as the images are of sense and motion: Isa. xliv.
   18, They have not known, nor understood; for he hath shut their eyes,
   that they cannot see, and their hearts, that they cannot understand.'
   There is a fatal obduration upon them all along there. Their
   senselessness is set forth from ver. 9 to ver. 20; they that worship
   the work of their own hands are themselves but stocks and stones, being
   blinded by the just judgment of God. If it be said this is meant of the
   idols of the Gentiles, not of the images of God, and Christ, and the
   Virgin Mary, and saints; still God will not be worshipped by an idol,
   and there is no difference between the images of the papists and the
   heathens, but only in the name.

   (2.) Another thing that I will instance in is the invocation of
   saints--a sottish error, and respect paid to them that are so far out
   of the reach of our commerce; and a thing not only without precept,
   promise, or precedent in scripture, but also against scripture, which
   always directeth to God by one Mediator, the Lord Jesus Christ. The
   scripture saith, Go to God if you lack anything, and they say, Go to
   the saints; if they say, not as authors of grace, or any divine
   blessing, but as intercessors, though that be not true, yet that
   derogateth from Christ, whose office it is to intercede with the
   Father. So that this is to put the creature in the place of God. But it
   is not only contrary to scripture, but the very motion and inclination
   of the Spirit when he stirreth us or moveth us to pray: Rom. viii. 15,
   Ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father;'
   Gal. iv. 6, And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of
   his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father;' he inclineth us to
   come to God, and yet this they will leave.

   (3.) A third error that I shall instance in is, that man may
   supererogate, not only merit for himself, but lay in an overplus to
   increase the treasure of the church; when the scripture telleth us that
   our best works are imperfect, yea, polluted; and our Lord himself hath
   told us that when ye have done all, say ye, We are unprofitable
   servants.' Luke xvii. 10. But what will not men believe that can
   believe these things? There are other absurdities as gross as these,
   but this sufficeth for a taste.

   [2.] The obstinacy wherewith they cleave to them. Nothing will reclaim
   them; not scripture, nor reason, nor evidence of truth, but they still
   cry the opinion of the church, and the faith of their fore fathers, and
   will invent any paltry shift and distinction, rather recede from
   anything than once admit that the church hath erred; like the obstinate
   Jews in Christ's time, that denied apparent matter of fact, John viii.
   33, We were never in bondage to any man,' though they were in Egypt and
   Babylon, and were now under servitude and the power of the Romans.
   Though we prove they have erred, and do err, still the church cannot
   err; or rather, like the elder Jews in the prophet Jeremiah's time,
   Jer. xliv. 16-19, As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the
   name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee. But we will certainly do
   whatsoever goeth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen
   of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we,
   and our fathers, and our kings, and our princes: for then we had plenty
   of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. But since we have left off
   burning incense to the queen of heaven, we have wanted all things, and
   have been consumed by the sword and the famine.' Such sottish obstinacy
   is there in men that dote upon their own invented superstitious and
   idolatrous services, custom, antiquity, practice of their ancestors,
   the authority and usage of their great ones, their rulers, the
   generality of observance. This is their knot of arguments by which they
   confirm themselves; just as the papists plead for their superstitions
   at this day; and to make the mess more complete, they add the plenty
   and prosperity they enjoyed--what a merry world it was before the new
   gospel came in, when they had nothing but mass and matins; and all the
   calamities that have fallen out they impute not to their own sins, but
   to the gospel. Now, when a people are thus obstinate, and measure
   religion not by reasons of conscience, but the interests of the belly,
   it is a sign that they are under the power of delusion, and error hath
   more efficacy with such corrupt minds than the truth.

   [3.] The causes of it show the efficacy of error. (1.) The sinning of
   their learned to keep out all instructions, allowing the vulgar only
   prayers in a strange tongue, and the scriptures in no tongue, and
   teaching them implicitly to believe as the church believeth. When the
   Lord permitteth such guides to order the affairs of his church, his
   great judgment of occecation and obduration is upon them: Jer. v. 31,
   The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their
   means, and my people love to have it so.' (2.) When gain, interest, and
   ambition move them thereunto; as those masters in the Acts exclaim
   against Paul and Silas, when they saw their hope of gain was gone, Acts
   xvi. 19-21, These men do exceedingly trouble the city;' and Demetrius,
   Acts xix. 25, Ye know by this craft we have our wealth.' This is a
   tender point to touch interest, and when once it cometh to this, they
   will proceed in their folly, and defend one falsehood with another; for
   the great idol of the world is gain or love of money: 1 Tim. vi. 10,
   For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted
   after, they have erred from the faith.' It were a happiness if such
   kind of arguments did only prevail with us to embrace a religion that
   might convince others that it was religion itself that we loved; that
   our interests did not keep others from their duty, and that we could
   embrace a religion for the goodness of it, even to our own loss. (3.)
   Another cause is pride of themselves, and prejudice to others; lest
   they should seem to be in an error and wrong, and to learn of a few
   novelists shall they teach them? No; rather they will remain ignorant
   still. Alas! it is not easy to strike sail, and submit to the teaching
   of those whom they hate; therefore men continue those first prejudices
   they have imbibed, and will rather live and die in their errors than
   give God glory by a submission to truth, such a proud opinion and
   conceit have they of their own learning and knowledge. This cause also
   conduceth to make the resolution more strong--pre-engagement in a
   contrary way. It is disgraceful to change; men think it is taken notice
   of as a great wonder, Acts vi. 7, that a great company of the priests
   were obedient to the faith.' But such wonders are not wrought every
   day; they of all men are most pertinacious; but God can of stones raise
   up children to Abraham. Now, would to God these causes of error were
   only found in the antichristian estate. They are everywhere, but these
   cause strong delusion.

   3. The issue and effect; that they should believe a lie. Two things
   must be explained:--(1.) The object; (2.) The act.

   [1.] The object: a lie; that is, either--(1.) False doctrines: 1 Tim.
   iv. 2, Speaking lies in hypocrisy,' when palpable errors are taken for
   truths. A man given over by God to delusion will swallow the grossest
   errors and fictions, and that in matters dangerous and destructive to
   salvation. False doctrines are often called a lie in scripture, as
   opposite to the truth; and yet such things are received by those from
   whose parts the world could expect better things. (2.) False miracles
   in their legends. A man would wonder any should have the face to
   obtrude such ridiculous stories, and scandalous to religion, upon the
   world. (3.) False calumnies against those instruments whom God employed
   in the Reformation. Popery is a religion supported by lies; as that
   Calvin was a sodomite, and burnt in the shoulder at Noyon for that
   crime, and the Popish dean and chapter of that place have published his
   vindicate; that Luther was an incarnate devil, begotten by an incubus.
   I should weary you to rake in this dunghill; but I must close it with
   the general observation that antichristians will lie; some among them
   call them pious frauds, but they are diabolical forgeries.

   [2.] The act is, that they are given up to believe a lie. This must be
   applied to their erroneous doctrines, as common to them all; to their
   false miracles and calumnies; not to the inventors, but to the seduced,
   who swallow these things. All that oppose the truth do not go
   apparently against conscience, but being given up to the efficacy of
   error, they may believe that false religion wherein they live. Let us
   open the term believe. What is it to believe a thing? You may know by
   the opposites. Now, opposite to faith there is--(1.) Doubtfulness, when
   men halt between two opinions: 1 Kings xviii. 21, If the Lord be God,
   follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.' This doubtfulness proceedeth
   from want of bringing the case to a trial and thorough hearing. (2.)
   Conjecture: Acts xxvi. 28, almost persuaded--Almost thou persuadest me
   to be a Christian.' (3.) Opinion: Mat. xiii. 4, Hath not root in
   himself, but dureth for a while,' &c. (4.) Firm persuasion. They will
   censure nothing; for if of truth, John vi. 69, We believe and are
   sure,' &c.; if of error, Acts xxvi. 9, I verily thought with myself
   that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of
   Nazareth.' (5.) Resolved adherence. If to the truth, that is called
   receiving the truth in the love of it;' if to error, it is seen in
   men's obstinacy and zeal suffering in it: 1 Kings xviii. 28, Cutting
   themselves with knives and lances, till blood gushed out.' Suffering
   for it; for a man may give his body to be burned for an error, a man
   may sacrifice a strong body to a stubborn mind: 1 Cor. xiii. 3, Though
   I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
   nothing.' And persecuting the contrary: John xvi. 2, They shall put you
   out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whoso ever killeth
   you will think that he doeth God service.' To apply this:--Many that
   live within the kingdom of Antichrist, some are doubtful, some almost
   persuaded, some espouse the common prevailing opinions, others adhere
   to them with much false zeal and superstition; these are those who are
   given up to believe a lie.

   Use 1. Information.

   1. To show us the reason why so many learned men are captivated by
   Antichrist, and live yet in the popish religion, for this is a great
   scruple to many. The answer is ready: The Lord hath suffered them to be
   deluded by him whose coming is after the working of Satan in all power,
   &c.: Rev. xvii. 2, The inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk
   with the wine of her fornication.' It is an intoxication; the errors of
   that state are plausibly defended and supported by worldly interests.
   There is the witchery of worldly allurements, and the intoxicating wine
   of errors defended and owned within their bounds and places of their
   education and abode; so that men have seemed to lose their
   understandings, and not have that advisedness which well becomes a man.
   Possibly they may have doubts and checks of conscience, but the name of
   the church charmeth them, and worldly magnificence strangely inveigleth
   them. They may know that the religion professed by Protestants is
   sincere, holy, and saving; but being allured by licentiousness, or
   entangled by covetousness, or puffed up with pride, are loth to change,
   or are vanquished and astonished with fear of death, and other
   inconveniencies; or, it may be, do not use that advised and serious
   deliberation, which a matter of salvation requireth. Four causes may be
   given:--(1.) Self-confidence. God will show the folly of those that
   depend on the strength of their own wit: Prov. iii. 5, 6, Trust in the
   Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding:
   in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths;' and
   therefore will bring to nought the wisdom of the wise, and destroy the
   understanding of the prudent, when it is lifted up against the
   interests of Christ's kingdom, 1 Cor. i. 19. (2.) Prejudice. The
   priests and scribes could readily tell that Christ was to be born in
   Bethlehem when Herod sent to consult them, Mat. ii. 4-6; yet who more
   obstinate against him that was born there? They expected a temporal
   Messiah, and therefore could not see what they saw. What was apparent
   to children was a riddle to the rabbis. So they expect some open enemy
   of the church to attack it by power and force, little dreaming of a
   bishop, &c. (3.) Pride. Many of the Jewish church believed in Christ,
   but they did not profess him, lest they should be put out of the
   synagogue: John xii. 42, 43, They loved the praise of men more than the
   praise of God.' They loved not an hated opinion. Many may fear the Pope
   to be Antichrist, but pride and interest will not let them submit to a
   change. (4.) The judgment of God is the great cause that men do not, or
   will not, know Antichrist; God hath not given them eyes to see, as
   Christ was not received in Jerusalem; the things of their peace were
   hid from their eyes: Luke xix. 41, 42, He beheld the city, and wept
   over it, saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
   day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from
   thine eyes.'

   2. It showeth us that the prevalency of this wicked one should be no
   blemish to providence; for the permission of him is one of God's
   dreadful providential dispensations. That it should have such success,
   it raiseth atheistical thoughts in weak spirits; yea, it is an offence
   to the godly, as it is a prejudice to the truth. But God hereby will
   show us:--(1.) That there are deceits and errors as well as truth in
   the world; much of choice, not chance; and lest we should think this an
   antiquated dispensation, to try the professors of the gospel who lived
   in the midst of pagans; it cometh nearer to us. But he that condemneth
   all religion on this account, judgeth one man for another's crime,
   which is unjust doth as foolishly as he that thinketh there is no true
   money because there are some counterfeit pieces. (2.) That God, in
   concomitancy with the gospel, will discover his dreadful justice as
   well as his wonderful mercy by it, that we may tremble whilst we admire
   grace. (3.) That it is a great evil to be deceivers or active promoters
   of delusions, and it will not wholly excuse us that we are deceived,
   Mat. xv. 14. (4.) What need all serious Christians have to pray to God
   not to be led into temptation. Alas! what would become of us if left to
   ourselves in an hour of temptation? (5.) Let us fear to slight the
   grace offered. Among other threatenings, God threateneth to smite his
   people with blindness: Deut. xxviii. 28, The Lord shall smite thee with
   madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart.' (6.) What a ready
   way to destruction it is to measure religion by worldly interests. This
   bred Antichrist, kept him up in the world, and blindeth his seduced
   proselytes to this day.

   Use 2. Is caution to take heed of spiritual blindness and infatuation,
   that this judgment fall not upon us; that God leave us not to our own
   lusts, hearts, and counsels, without check and restraint. It may in
   part befall God's people. What shall we do to avoid it? (1.) Take heed
   of sinning against light, either by sins of omission or commission:
   James iv. 17, To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him
   it is sin.' They will find it to be sin in the sad effects. (2.) Take
   -heed of hypocrisy in the profession of the truth. God oweth the
   hypocrite an ill turn, and seemeth to be engaged to discover him before
   the congregation: Prov. xxvi. 26, Whose hatred is covered by deceit,
   his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation;' and
   usually it is by giving him up to some licentious practice or strong
   delusion, by which he breaketh the neck of his profession. (3.) Take
   heed of pride and carnal self-sufficiency. God may leave his people to
   dangerous falls when they make their bosom their oracle, and think to
   carry all by the strength of their own understanding: 2 Chron. xxxii.
   31, God left him to try him, that he might know all that was in his
   heart.' It is good to consult with God continually. (4.) Take heed of
   following the rabble: John iv. 20, Our fathers worshipped in this
   mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to
   worship,' &c. But learn to see by your own eyes, that you may have sure
   evidence you are in God's way, Prov. xxiv. 13, 14.

SERMON X.

   That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had
   pleasure in unrighteousness.--2 Thes. II. 12.

   THEIR punishment in the other world. Where--(1.) The terribleness of
   it; (2.) The righteousness and justice of it.

   1. The terribleness: that they all might be damned; that is, filling up
   the measure of their obduration, they may at length fall into just
   condemnation.

   2. The justice and equity of it, which is two ways expressed:--

   [1.] Negatively: they believed not the truth; that is, received not the
   gospel in the simplicity of it, as revealed by Christ and his apostles,
   and recorded in the scriptures, but wilfully, and for their interest's
   sake, gave up themselves to these corruptions.

   [2.] Positively: had pleasure in unrighteousness. In the 10th verse it
   was, They received not the love of the truth;' now when the meritorious
   cause is repeated, there is something more added: they had a love to,
   and delight in, other things, eudokesantes en te adikia. Here two
   things must be explained.

   1. What is adikia--unrighteousness?

   2. What is eudoki'a--taking pleasure in unrighteousness?

   1. What is adikia--unrighteousness? Righteousness is giving every one
   his due; and denying them their due is unrighteousness. There is a
   giving man his due, and a giving God his due: Mat. xxii. 21, Render
   unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that
   are God's.' Righteousness is often put for giving man his due: Titus
   ii. 12, That we should live soberly, righteously,' &c.; and giving God
   his due, which is worship and reverence: Ps. xxix. 2, Give unto the
   Lord the glory due unto his name;' and again, Ps. xcvi. 8, Give unto
   the Lord the glory due to his name; bring an offering and come into his
   courts.' Now this unrighteousness here spoken of is principally meant
   in the latter sense. False ways of worship are the greatest
   unrighteousness that can be practised; for the duty that we owe to God
   is the most righteous thing in the world. Now, by false worship you
   withdraw the glory of God from him, and communicate it to another.
   Worship is his own proper due, both by the light of nature and
   scripture; and therefore the Gentiles, which had the light of nature,
   are said to detain the truth, en adiki'a,' Rom. i. 18. Why? The reason
   is rendered in the after verses. Ver. 23, They changed the glory of God
   into an image made like a corruptible man.' Ver. 25, They changed the
   truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more
   than the Creator.' This was their adiki'a, their unrighteousness, or
   injurious dealing with God. So the antichristians that had the light of
   scripture, though under palliated pretences, changed the truth of God
   into a lie, loved their own errors more than simple and plain
   Christianity, or the true knowledge of God, and diverted the worship
   from himself unto an idol.

   2. They had pleasure in unrighteousness;' in these things they please
   themselves, not lapse into it out of simple ignorance and error of
   mind. And so the apostle parallels the two great apostasies: that from
   the light of nature, and that from the light of the gospel. Light of
   nature: Rom. i. 32, Not only do these things, but have pleasure in them
   that do them.' Light of scripture: Have pleasure in unrighteousness.'
   They are mad upon their idols and images; not only are idolaters, but
   delight in idolatry and image-worship: Ps. xcvii. 7, That boast
   themselves of idols.'

   Now to observe some things.

   1. Errors of judgment, as well as sins of practice, may bring damnation
   upon the souls of men. All sins do in their own nature tend to
   damnation: Rom. vi. 23, For the wages of sin is death.' And errors of
   judgment are sins, for they are contrary to the rule or law of God: 1
   John iii. 4, Whosoever committeth sin, transgresseth also the law, for
   sin is the transgression of the law.' Any swerving from the law is sin;
   and they are inductive of other sins; for if the eye be blind, the
   whole body is full of darkness.' Mat. vi. 23; it perverts our zeal.
   There is nothing so mischievous, wicked, and cruel, that a man blinded
   with error will not attempt against those that differ from him: John
   xvi. 2, They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
   that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth. God service,' A
   blind horse is full of mettle, but ever and anon stumbleth. Therefore,
   if a man be not guided by sound judgment, his zealous affections will
   precipitate him into mischief. As the Jews, that persecuted Christ and
   his apostles, had a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge,' Rom.
   x. 2, so the Popish zealots; with what fury have they persecuted the
   innocent and sincere servants of Christ! The papists would be angry if
   we should not reckon St Dominic a zealous man; and the poor Albigenses
   felt the bitter effects of that zeal, in the destruction of many
   thousands by inhuman butcheries and villanies about Toulouse, &c. The
   Lord deliver us from the furies of transported, brain-sick zealots!

   2. Though all errors may bring damnation upon the souls of men, yet
   some more especially than others may be said to be damning; as 2 Peter
   ii. 1, Some shall bring in damnable heresies.' Now, this may be either
   from the matter or manner of holding them:--

   [1.] From the matter, if destructive of the way of salvation by Christ.
   Some are utterly inconsistent with salvation and eternal life, as
   errors in the fundamentals in religion. As suppose that a man should
   reject or refuse Christ after a sufficient proposal of the gospel to
   him, there is no question but this is damning unbelief: John iii. 19,
   And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
   men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.'
   But yet we are not to say that alone damneth. There are other things
   necessary to salvation contained under that general truth. The
   scripture saith, John xvii. 3, And this is life eternal, that they
   might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast
   sent.' There is the sum of what is necessary to salvation: that God is
   to be known, loved, obeyed, worshipped, and enjoyed; and the Lord Jesus
   to be owned as our Redeemer and Saviour, to bring us home to God, and
   to procure for us the gifts of pardon and life, and this life to be
   begun here, and perfected in heaven. Other things are of moment to
   clear these necessary truths, but they may be all reduced thereunto.
   The truth is, the question about the matter to be believed is not what
   divine revelations are necessary to be believed or rejected, when
   sufficiently proposed, for all points, without exception, are so; but
   what are simply and absolutely necessary to eternal life, and these are
   points of faith, and practice, and obedience. The points of faith are a
   knowledge of God in Christ; and practice, that we be regenerated: John
   iii. 5, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
   enter into the kingdom of God.' And live a holy life: Heb. xii. 14,
   Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see
   the Lord.'

   [2.] From the manner. (1.) When men profess what they believe not, and
   voluntarily choose error for worldly ends, though it be a less error
   against the scripture, and consistent with the main tenor of salvation,
   yet, if taken up against conscience, for by-ends, it is a matter of sad
   consequence; for this is living in a known sin. Some may be blinded for
   a time, out of terror and compassion, and their case is sad till they
   express solemn repentance; but when there is a reluctation against
   clear light, and an obstinacy in that reluctation, this man is
   condemned in himself: Titus iii. 11, Such a man is subverted and
   sinneth, being condemned of himself.' There cannot be a greater
   argument of a will unsubdued to God, than to stand out against
   conviction out of secular respects. This is to love darkness more than
   light, and argueth such pravity of heart as is inconsistent with faith
   and salvation. Some ignorant souls may hold dangerous errors, and which
   to others would be damnable; yet they may not actually damn them,
   because they do not rebel against the light; and may be retracted by a
   general repentance or seeking of pardon for all their known or unknown
   sins: Ps. xix. 12, 13, Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me
   from secret faults: keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins;
   let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I
   shall be innocent from the great transgression.'

   (2.) When they are vented by some professor of Christianity, to the
   seducing of others, and rending of the church, and drawing disciples
   after them, this addeth a new guilt to their errors, and maketh them
   the more damnable: Acts xx. 30, Also of your own selves shall men
   arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.'
   These are properly heretics and ringleaders of sects; therefore
   heresies are reckoned among the works of the flesh: Gal. v. 20,
   Emulation, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies;' increasing their own
   doom and judgment. These, under a Christian name, seduce and lead away
   the church from Christ; they pervert the holy ways of God, and draw his
   people from serving him in spirit and truth.

   (3.) When, though they should not err fundamentally, they so far
   debauch Christianity, as that God giveth them up to believe a lie, and
   to take pleasure in unrighteousness, that is, to defend and maintain
   apparent corruptions of Christian doctrine and worship. Of doctrine,
   for it is here said they believe a lie, and they believe not the truth.
   Of worship, for it is said they take pleasure in unrighteousness. A
   party thus given up by God we should shun, as we would shun a plague or
   come out of Bedlam; for these men have lost their spiritual wits, and
   see not that which the common light of Christianity doth disprove,
   however they retain the name of Christians, and make a cry of the
   church! the church! as the Jews did of the temple of the Lord, and
   retain some truth among them; for such a party is here described.

   (4.) When there is gross negligence, or not taking pains to know
   better, it is equivalent to reluctation or standing out against light;
   crassa negligentia dolus est--there is a deceit in laziness or affected
   ignorance: John iii. 20, They will not come to the light, lest their
   deeds should be reproved;' 2 Peter iii. 5, They are willingly
   ignorant.' Those that please themselves in the ignorance of any truth,
   err not only in their minds, but their hearts. It is the duty of God's
   people to understand what is his will: Eph. v. 17, Be not unwise, but
   understanding what the will of the Lord is.' And it is their practice:
   Rom. xii. 2, That ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and
   perfect will of God;' Ps. i. 2, His delight is in the law of the Lord,
   and therein doth he meditate day and night.' We should be searching
   still. But when men will not know what they have a mind to hate, it
   argueth a secret sore, and suspicion of the truth, and are loth to
   follow it too close, lest it cross their lusts and interests.

   3. That the way and errors of Popery are damnable, and it is very
   unsafe living in that society and combination. I prove it--(1.) Because
   they live in wilful disobedience to God. They violate the manifest
   commandments of God, while they hold it lawful to worship pictures and
   images, to make pictures of the Trinity, to invocate saints and angels,
   to deny laymen the cup in the sacrament, to adore the sacrament, to
   prohibit certain orders of men and women to marry, to celebrate the
   public service in a language which ordinarily men and women that assist
   understand not. In all these things they offer apparent violence to
   God's precepts. And that their whole worship is polluted with a gross
   superstition; as, for instance, to worship images is expressly against
   God's word: Ps. xcvii. 7, Confounded be all they that worship graven
   images, that boast themselves of idols. Worship him, all ye gods.' The
   scripture, you see, denounceth confusion to all worshippers of images,
   and they are reckoned as enemies of Christ's kingdom (for it is applied
   to Christ, Heb. i. 6, And let all the angels of God worship him') that:
   would set up the worship and service of them in his church, in the
   exercise of their religion, especially those who glory in them, and
   boast of them, and set them forth as the glory of their way and
   worship. No; he disdaineth all this relative worship at or before
   images, which men would give unto him, and showeth that all the powers
   of this world and the other, angels and potentates, should immediately
   worship Christ. For the second point, picturing the Trinity, God hath
   not only forbidden it, but argued against it: Deut. iv. 15, 16, Take
   therefore good heed unto yourselves, for ye saw no similitude, when the
   Lord spake to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire; lest ye
   corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of
   anything male or female.' See how cautelous God is to prevent this
   abuse, and yet how boldly men practise it. For the third instance, the
   invocation of saints and angels, our Lord hath taught us how to repel
   that temptation: Mat. iv. 10, It is written, thou shalt worship the
   Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve;' that religious service
   and worship is due only to God. No creature can claim it without
   sacrilege, nor can we give it to them without idolatry. And God being
   so jealous of his honour, every Christian should be careful that he
   doth not divert it from him. They have many distinctions to excuse
   themselves to the world, but I doubt how they will excuse themselves to
   God. For the fourth particular, adoring the sacrament, I shall speak to
   again anon; that is a mean, not an object of worship. The fifth,
   prohibiting certain orders of men and women to marry, which the apostle
   calleth doctrines of devils: 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2, In the latter times some
   shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and
   doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their
   conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry,' &c. For the
   sixth, celebrating public service in an unknown tongue, it is contrary
   to the apostle's reasoning: 1 Cor. xiv. 14-17, For if I pray in an
   unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
   What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the
   understanding also; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with
   the understanding also; else, when thou shalt bless with the spirit,
   how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy
   giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? for
   thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.' For the
   seventh, communion in one kind, this is against Christ's express
   institution: Mat. xxvi. 26, 27, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
   brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my
   body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
   saying, Drink ye all of it.' The apostle supposeth that every one can
   examine himself: 1 Cor. xi. 28, But let a man examine himself, and so
   let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.' Now for this
   usurping synagogue to come as they do, with a non obstante to the
   statutes of God, who can join with them in these corruptions and
   usurpations without peril of salvation? (2.) That the way of Popery is
   damnable, because they deprive the people of the means of salvation,
   contrary to the express injunctions from God: John v. 39, Search the
   scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are
   they which testify of me;' Col. iii. 16, Let the word of Christ dwell
   in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in
   psalms and hymns.' The saints are commended, Acts xvii. 11, In that
   they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
   scriptures daily, whether those things were so;' and 2 Tim. iii. 15,
   that he knew the scriptures, which are able to make wise unto
   salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.' This is the seed of
   life, food of souls, rule of faith and manners, our strength against
   temptations: 1 John ii. 14, I have written unto you, young men, because
   ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome
   the wicked one.' Now to deprive the Lord's people of the bread of life,
   and word of life, what is it but to leave them to perish?

   The great charge is, they have pleasure in unrighteousness, that is,
   delight in idolatry, and corrupt or false worship, which is the
   greatest unrighteousness man can be guilty of. To evidence this, let us
   inquire--(1.) What is idolatry? (2.) Prove how notoriously they are
   guilty of it.

   First, What is idolatry? It is a worshipping of a creature with divine
   worship, and whosoever giveth divine worship to a creature committeth
   idolatry. This proposition is evident in the scripture; as when the
   Israelites worshipped the calf, literal or metaphorical idolatry, they
   are called idolaters: 1 Cor. x. 7, Neither be ye idolaters, as were
   some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink,
   and rose up to play.' And the covetous, that giveth that delight and
   trust to his wealth which is only due to God, is called an idolater:
   Eph. v. 5, Nor covetous man, who is an idolater;' and in many other
   places.

   Secondly, Now, that the papists are guilty of this, I prove:--

   1. By the several kinds of their idolatry: they have more variety of
   objects of worship than any society of men that ever lived in the
   world.

   First, Angels are creatures, and that they worship angels them selves
   confess. They consecrate churches unto them, offer solemn prayers unto
   them, and own the adoring them, though an angel forbiddeth this
   adoration: Rev. xix. 10, And he said unto me, See thou do it not, I am
   thy fellow-servant,' &c. And St Paul telleth us, that they that worship
   angels do not hold the head, Col. i. 18, 19. So that angel-worship
   proveth to be a damnable error.

   Secondly, The adoration of saints, to whom they give religious worship,
   and invoke them as helpers, and honour them with fastings, watchings,
   and prayers, as Suarez acknowledged; and yet God is express that he
   will not give his glory to another,' Isa. xlii. 8. They are to be
   honoured indeed for imitation, but not adored for religion.

   The third object is the Virgin Mary, to whom they pray more than they
   do to God. In the rosary there is this prayer: Beata Maria, salva omnes
   qui te glorificant--and we beseech thee to hear us, good Lady; that
   address, Monstra te esse matrem, and one divided, inter ubera et
   vulnera, the breasts of the Virgin and wounds of Christ, as if the milk
   of the one were as sovereign and as precious as the blood of the other.
   It were endless to rake in this filthy puddle: how many books are there
   concluded with Laus Deo et Virgini Deiparae? that sometimes there is a
   more present relief by commemorating the name of Mary than by calling
   on the name of the Lord Jesus; in their exclamations, Jesu! Maria!--how
   often in their Te Deum, We praise thee, O Lady?

   Fourthly, Adoration of images. This is more foul than all the former,
   because directed to a more gross object. This is prophesied of
   Antichrist, that he and his abettors shall worship idols of silver, and
   gold, and brass, and wood, and stone.' Rev. ix. 20. Now tell a papist
   of this, and they say they do not terminate their worship in the image,
   but in the party whom it representeth; the same said the pagan, Non
   lapidem sed Jovem in lapide (Julian the apostate). But God hath
   forbidden bowing to or before an image.

   Fifthly, The worshipping of the cross, not only by cupping, that is,
   bowing, cringing, but prayers. O crux, ave! spes unica hoc passionis
   tempore, auge piis justitiam reisque dona veniam--All hail, cross! our
   only hope this time of passion; augment the godly's devotion, and
   forgive the transgression of the guilty.

   Sixthly, The bread in the sacrament; the papists give it cultum
   latriae, that worship which is due to God. Those heathens worshipped
   living animals, but these adore a piece of bread, kneel to it in their
   chapels and oratories, yea, in the midst of the streets when it is
   carried in procession. These are the idols whom they worship; and what
   hope of salvation is there in a religion where the heart is turned so
   much from God to the creature?

   2. That they are more culpable than the heathens. (1.) As to their
   hypocrisy, by distinctions and veil of piety wherewith they disguise
   all this; for this delight in unrighteousness was called before, the
   deceivableness of unrighteousness.' They profess to abhor idols, and
   yet worship images, and make that a point of Christianity which is
   directly contrary to the drift of it, which is to teach us to worship
   God in the Spirit. (2.) As to their helps against it, the pagans were
   never taught to do better; though they sinned against the light of
   nature in worshipping God by images, yet they had no scripture, no such
   express prohibitions to caution them as we have from God. They pretend
   to believe the scriptures, yet how do they seek to evade the force of
   them by crafty distinctions that will never satisfy conscience, though
   they help to blind the mind and harden the heart. That which I urge is
   this, they were never interdicted this kind of worship by their gods;
   but these know that it is severely forbidden by our God, and the second
   commandment so stareth in their faces that it is expunged out of their
   catechisms; and Vasquez is bold to affirm that the second commandment
   is ceremonial. Lactantius of old said, Non est dubium, religio nulla
   est ubi cujusque simulachrum est. (3.) The Pagans did adore their gods
   in their images, but never was any so sottish among them to imagine
   that an image was to be adored with the same degree of worship as God
   himself; but this is the corrupt doctrine of the papists, that an image
   is to be worshipped with the same worship wherewith God himself is
   worshipped. Imagini Christi latria debetur (Aquinas); that is, the
   proper worship of God.

   Use 1. To show how necessary it is to take heed that we be not found
   among the followers of Antichrist, since these errors are damnable.
   Salvation and damnation are not trifles, nor matters to be played
   withal. Surely we need have our eyes in our head, and not to be
   hoodwinked, when we are upon the brink of a bottomless gulf. Both sides
   lay damnation at one another's door: they, for our departing from the
   catholic church, out of which is no salvation, as they pretend; we,
   upon their departing from the catholic faith and simplicity of the
   gospel. Now external order is not of such consideration as faith; but
   when they will be able to prove that Christ hath settled this order in
   the church, that all his subjects should be obedient to one universal
   visible head, and that this head is the Pope, and therefore when their
   very order is an encroachment and usurpation, to depart from them is to
   return to Christ. Again, where is salvation most likely to be found?
   rather with them who seek all their religion in the scriptures, and
   stick there, or with those who, not contented with the apostolical
   doctrine contained in the scriptures, have brought in unwritten
   traditions as an equal rule of faith with scripture, and the sacrifice
   of the mass and purgatory, the religious invocations of saints, and
   many other enormities, and uphold these innovations with all manner of
   tyranny and cruelty exercised upon Christ's faithful servants? If men
   go to heaven without prayers which they understand, and scriptures,
   half Christ's sacrament, a piece of his merits, and some superstitious
   observances, yea, plain idolatry, then the way to heaven is sooner to
   be had in Popery. But he that hath but half an eye may soon see which
   is the surer side. Surely the surest way to avoid damnation is to avoid
   sin. Now, where are souls so much in danger of sin as in the Roman
   society, where so little is given to internal life and piety, and so
   much to external pomp and service; and where errors are so palpable,
   that either men do not believe them with their hearts, or, if their
   hearts were upright and not perverse and obstinate, could not believe
   them? But just so is the way of Popery to true Christianity. Surely
   whatever it be to papists, it would be absolutely damnable to us, as
   wilfully to thrust ourselves upon apparent ruin. There is a cavil or
   pretence which I shall speak unto on this occasion: that many
   Protestants confess papists may be saved in their faith; whereas they
   hold Protestants and other heretics may not be saved out of the
   catholic church; and therefore it is safe to enter into that way which
   is safe by the consent of both parts.

   Ans. (1.) Men's opinions are no ground of faith. Persons may be in a
   sad, woeful case, that men speak well of: Luke vi. 26, Woe unto you
   when all men shall speak well of you!' It is not what man saith, but
   what the word of God saith. Now the word speaketh terrible things to
   them: Them that perish, and that they all might be damned who believed
   not the truth, &c. (2.) The word of God teacheth us to judge of the
   way, rather than persons, who stand or fall to their own master. The
   way is damnable. If, on the one side, there be charity to some persons
   that sin of invincible ignorance, and are saved as by fire,' 1 Cor.
   iii. 13, which the other side will not grant to a contrary persuasion;
   it argueth charity on one side, which hopeth all things; malice on the
   other, who rashly condemn men without evidence, yea, against it. (3.)
   If this argument would hold good, it had been better, in Christ and the
   apostles' time, to be a Jewish proselyte than a Christian. Christ
   acknowledged salvation is of the Jews,'--their promises of adoption and
   glory; but the Jews pronounced him and his followers
   accursed--scourged, imprisoned them; yet did not get so far as papists,
   to murder and butcher them. Suppose a little time that Catholics owned
   Donatists as brethren, allowed their baptism; but Donatists are
   re-baptised, and upon pain of damnation require all so to be, and say,
   Save thy soul, become a Christian. Now a pagan should rather by this
   argument join himself to Donatists than Catholics. Lastly, the argument
   may be retorted--A Protestant keepeth himself to his Bible, baptismal
   covenant, creed, but denieth many things which papists believe and
   practise, as papal infallibility, transubstantiation, purgatory,
   invocation of saints, worshipping of images. They cannot but say
   Protestants are in the right.

   Use 2. Observe the degrees of obduration, not receiving the truth in
   the love of it, believing a lie, discarding truth, and then taking
   pleasure in unrighteousness, and then cometh damnation.

SERMON XI.

   But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren,
   beloved of the Lord, because the Lord hath from the beginning chosen
   you to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of
   the truth.--2 Thes. II. 13.

   THE adversative particle but showeth what respect these words have to
   what went before. He had spoken of God's direful judgment, of sending
   strong delusion on them that had no love to the pure truth, but sinned
   against light, and had pleasure in the false worship and superstitions
   countenanced by the world. Now, lest the Thessalonians should be
   troubled at this sad prediction, he showeth what cause he had to bless
   God in their behalf. The subjoining of this consolation doth teach us
   three things:--

   1. That it is a great favour of God to us to escape antichristian
   errors. They are so dangerous in their own nature, so insinuative and
   inveigling by plausible appearance, and accompanied with such worldly
   baits and advantages, that it is a great mercy that God hath taught us
   better things. But then be sure you be in the right out of conscience
   and evidence, not out of faction and interest; and that you hate Popery
   out of the love of the truth, rather than because you are out of the
   reach of the temptation. However, it is a great mercy that God keepeth
   off the temptation till we are better settled in religion.

   2. That the election of God giveth a people great advantages against
   errors, especially against the impostures of Antichrist; for when he
   speaketh of the sad estate of those who are seduced by the man of sin,
   he presently addeth, But we are bound to give thanks to God for you,
   for he hath chosen you to salvation.' You will say the Thessalonians
   received the gospel before these corruptions were brought into the
   church; but, though Antichrist was not then in being, and this corrupt
   Christianity not then set afoot, yet there were some preparations for
   it. The mystery of iniquity already worketh, and they were preserved
   from the taint of it by the election of God; for either God suffereth
   not the elect to be deceived in momentous points, or sooner or later he
   reduceth them: The purpose of God according to election must stand,'
   Rom. ix. 11; and Rom. xi. 7, The election hath obtained, and the rest
   were blinded;' so 2 Tim. ii. 18, 19, They have overthrown the faith of
   some, nevertheless the foundation of the Lord standeth sure.' Still the
   elect of God escape the seduction, and especially antichristian error:
   Rev. xiii. 8, The dwellers upon earth shall worship him, whose names
   are not written in the Lamb's book of life.'

   3. How careful we should be to support the hearts of God's people, when
   we speak of his terrible judgments on the wicked. This was the practice
   of the apostles everywhere; as when the author to the Hebrews had
   spoken of the dreadful estate of apostates, whose end is to be burned:'
   Heb. vi. 9, But we are persuaded better things of you, and things that
   accompany salvation, though we thus speak;' he did not condemn them all
   as apostates, nor would discourage them by that terrible threatening,
   So again, after another terrible passage: Heb. x. 39, But we are not of
   them that draw back to perdition, but of them that believe to the
   saving of the soul.' Once more, when another apostle had spoken of the
   sin unto death, which is not to be prayed for, he presently addeth, 1
   John v. 18, 19, Whosoever is born of God, sinneth not; but he that is
   begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
   And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
   wickedness.' Zuinglius saith, Bone Christiane, haec nihil ad te,
   &c.--Good Christian, this is not thy portion, when he had flashed the
   terrors of the Lord in the face of sinners. The reasons of this are
   partly with respect to the saints, who, sometimes out of weakness and
   infirmity, and sometimes out of tenderness of conscience, are apt to be
   startled, electorum corda semper ad se sollicite pudeant (Gregor.) We
   deserve such dreadful judgments, and therefore fear them; partly, with
   respect to ourselves, that we may rightly divide the word of truth: 2
   Tim. ii. 15, Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that
   needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.' Give
   every one his portion; make not their hearts sad whom God would not
   make sad; and, therefore, they are much to blame who, in reproving
   sinners, stab a saint at the heart, and take the doctrine but for a
   colour to make a perverse application. The apostle here useth more
   tenderness: God shall send them strong delusion. But we are bound
   always to give thanks for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord; because
   the Lord hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through
   sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.'

   In the words are two things:--

   1. An acknowledgment of this obligation to give thanks for them: but we
   are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, &c.

   2. The matter or particular cause of his thanksgiving: because the Lord
   hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, &c.

   First, There are--(1.) The titles he giveth: brethren,' and beloved of
   the Lord.' They were not only beloved of the apostle, but the Lord
   himself; both with an antecedent love, bestowing grace upon them, and
   also a consequent love, they believing in his name, living according to
   his precepts, suffering for the truth. (2.) His obligation to bless God
   in their behalf: We are bound to give thanks to God always for you.'
   There is--First, Giving thanks,' which showeth his esteem of the
   blessing. Secondly, Always,' which showeth how deeply he was affected
   with it. (3.) Ophei'lomen, We are bound;' he acknowledged a debt and
   bond of duty. We must not only give thanks to God for our own election,
   but the election of others, out of the law of brotherly love, we loving
   them as our own souls, and respect to the glory of God, which is
   promoted by the salvation of others as well as ourselves.

   Secondly, The matter of the thanksgiving, their election to salvation,
   which is two ways amplified:--(1.) By the antiquity of it: from the
   beginning;' that is, from everlasting, for so it is taken sometimes; as
   John i. 1, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God;'
   that is, before the first point of time, before God began to create all
   things. (2.) From the means of its accomplishment. Two are
   mentioned--one on God's part, the sanctification of the Spirit;' the
   other on ours, the belief of the truth.' From the whole observe:--

   Doct. That the great matter of our thanksgiving to God is his eternal
   election of us, whether for ourselves or others; this is that which
   leaveth a debt, or an indispensable obligation, always to bless and
   praise his name.

   In pursuing this point I shall first consider how election is here set
   forth; secondly, give you the reasons why this is the great matter of
   thanksgiving:--

   1. How it is here set forth.

   [1.] By the rise of it, which is the mere love of God; for he calleth
   these brethren, beloved of the Lord;' and that the only original cause
   and motive of election is God's love and grace. This is asserted in
   other scriptures; as, for instance, in the types of election and
   reprobation: Rom. ix. 13, Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated.'
   God's respect to Jacob above Esau is ascribed to his love. So to the
   posterity of Jacob, whom he distinguished from other nations: Deut.
   vii. 7, 8, The Lord did not set his love upon you, and choose you,
   because ye were more in number than any people, for ye were the fewest
   of all people; but because the Lord loved you.' And still the Lord's
   election is an election of grace. There is no antecedent worthiness in
   the people whom he chooseth: 2 Tim. i. 9, Not according to our works,
   but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given in Christ
   Jesus, before the world began.' Now grace is nothing but the love of
   God working freely and of its own inclination. [2.] The act itself: he
   hath chosen you;' making a distinction between them and others. Upon
   them he shall send strong delusion, but you hath he chosen to salvation
   through the belief of the truth. Those whom God hath chosen he
   separates from the world of the ungodly, or the corrupt heap of
   mankind, and consecrateth them unto himself; so that election is not a
   taking all, but some, and passing by others: 1 John v. 19, We are of
   God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.' A choice implieth a
   setting apart some for objects of his grace and instruments of his
   glory in the world, Ps. iv. 3. And the number is certain, for their
   names are said to be written in the rolls and records of heaven, when
   others are not written: Luke x. 20, Rejoice not that the spirits are
   subject unto you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in
   heaven:' Phil. iv. 3, Whose names are written in the book of life.' And
   others are said not to be written: Rev. xvii. 8, And they that dwell on
   the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of
   life from the foundation of the world.' And Rev. xx. 15, And whosoever
   was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of
   fire;' namely, those that perish by these delusions.

   [3.] It is set forth by the antiquity of it: from the beginning.' Eph.
   i. 4, He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world;' and
   Mat. xxv. 34, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
   prepared for you from the foundation of the world;' namely, as they
   belonged to his choice election. Love in God is of an old standing,
   even from all eternity. His thoughts and purposes of love were towards
   us a long time before they were discovered. Surely the ancientness of
   his love should beget an honourable esteem of it in our hearts; for who
   are we, that the thoughts of God should be taken up about us so long
   ago? And what is from everlasting is to everlasting, Ps. ciii. 17; for
   what is from eternity is to eternity, and dependeth not upon the
   accidents of time.

   [4.] By the means of its accomplishment. Two are mentioned, one on
   God's part, the other on ours--the sanctification of the Spirit, and
   the belief of the truth.' Where note:--

   (1.) That God's decree is both of ends and means, for all his purposes
   are executed by fit means. He that hath chosen us to salvation hath
   also chosen us to be holy, and to believe the truth. And without the
   means the end cannot be obtained; for without faith and holiness no
   grown person shall see God or escape condemnation. As to faith, it is
   clear: John iii. 36, He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on
   him.' And holiness is indispensably necessary: Heb. xii. 14, Without
   holiness no man shall see the Lord.' God had assured Paul, Acts xxvii.
   22, That there should be no loss of any man's life amongst them, except
   of the ship;' and afterwards, ver. 31, Paul telleth them, Except these
   abide in the ship ye cannot be saved.' How could the assurance given to
   Paul from God, and Paul's caution to the mariners stand together? Doth
   the purpose of God depend upon the will and actions of men? I
   answer--Not as a cause from whence it receiveth its force and strength,
   but as a means appointed also by God to the execution of his decree.
   For by the same decree God appointeth the event, what he will do, and
   the means by which he will have it to be done; and the Lord revealing
   by his word this conjunction of end and means, there is a necessity of
   duty lying upon man^to use these means, and not to expect the end
   without them. God in tended to save all in the ship, and yet the
   mariners must abide in the ship. And therefore, what God hath joined
   together let no man separate. If we separate these things, God doth not
   change his counsel, but we subvert his order to our own destruction.
   The scripture maketh it a grievous sin, a tempting of God, to expect
   the end without the use of means. In vain is the cavil, then, of those
   who would impeach the doctrine of God's free and unchangeable will
   concerning the salvation of the elect, upon the pretence that it taketh
   away the duty of man, and the necessity of our faith and obedience. No;
   God executeth his decree by the proper means. Arid wretched is their
   inference who say, If I be elected I shall be saved. No salvation can
   be obtained but by the sanctification of the Spirit and the belief of
   the truth. Arid worse is their confidence who profess assurance of
   their election, and yet walk after the flesh. No; till a man purge
   himself from youthful lusts he is not a vessel of honour sanctified and
   set apart for God, 2 Tim. ii. 21. And in vain do we hope to go to
   heaven till we take the way that leadeth thither. Devils have been cast
   out thence for unholiness, and therefore unholy men shall never be
   taken in there.

   (2.) That these things are not causes of election, but fruits of
   election, and means of execution of God's decree about our salvation.
   Sanctification is not a cause, but a subordinate end or means: Eph. i.
   4, He hath chosen us to be holy;' not because we are holy, but that we
   might be holy. So 1 Peter i. 2, Elect according to the foreknowledge of
   God, through the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience.' Not
   elected for it, but through it. When God had all mankind in his
   prospect and view, he freely chose out some to be sanctified and saved.
   We come to the possession of it through sanctification, that is, by it
   as a means. So for the other; faith is a fruit of election, not a
   foreseen cause: Acts ii. 47, The Lord added to the church daily such as
   should be saved.' None cometh to the church but those whom God draweth,
   and they are actually added to the church by a profession of faith; and
   such as should be saved were as many as were ordained to salvation Acts
   xiii. 48, And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.' The
   whole city were met together to hear, but as many as were ordained to
   eternal life believed. It is not said, as many as believed were
   ordained to eternal life, but the contrary; faith is not the cause of
   election, but election is the cause of faith.

   (3.) That being the necessary fruits, they are also evidences of our
   election. All that are sanctified by the Spirit and believe the truth
   belong to the election of God. Election itself is a secret in God's
   bosom, and is only manifested to us by the effects; and what are the
   necessary effects but sanctification by the Spirit, and a sound belief
   of the gospel?

   First, The sanctification of the Spirit is not only an external
   dedication to God, but an internal and real change. Some are externally
   dedicated, and may trample under foot the blood of the covenant whereby
   they are sanctified: Heb. x. 29, Of how much sorer punishment, suppose
   ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of
   God; and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
   sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of
   grace?' That is, were in external covenant with God, and visibly
   dedicated. But there is another sanctification, which is the fruit of
   the Spirit, working a real change in them: 1 Cor. vi. 11, And such were
   some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are justified, in the name of
   the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.' Find this, and you find
   a sufficient evidence, namely, if you become new creatures, and be
   enabled to forsake sin, and follow after that which is pleasing in the
   sight of God. Sanctification of the Spirit is not so much known by
   dedication and profession, but by the real and fixed inclination of
   your souls to God and heaven, and living accordingly; you are turned to
   God, and live to God.

   Secondly, Your belief of the truth, that is, of the gospel. Now this is
   meant not of a dead faith, or such a cold assent as only begets an
   opinion in us of the truth of Christian religion, but such a lively
   faith as bringeth us under the power of it; for it is opposed to them
   that do not receive the truth in the love of it, ver. 10: To them that
   believed not the truth, because they had pleasure in unrighteousness,'
   ver. 12; that lived under the power of fleshly and worldly lusts. And
   it is spoken of them who had received the truth, so as to obey it and
   suffer for it, as the Thessalonians are described all along; and in
   short, such a belief of the truth as caused them to enter into covenant
   with Christ, and make conscience of their fidelity to him. And here in
   this verse we learn that a bare belief of the truth doth not save,
   unless accompanied with the sanctification of the Spirit; and therefore
   both must be taken together. When the word cometh to us, not in word
   only, but in power and much assurance, and joy in the Holy Ghost,' it
   is an infallible evidence of our election of God, 1 Thes. i. 5. Alas!
   many have a general cold belief of the gospel, that never felt the
   effect of it upon their hearts.

   (4.) Observe the necessary connection that is between both these means,
   the sanctification of the Spirit, and the belief of the truth.

   First, There is a necessary connection between them, as between the
   cause and the effect; for none are powerfully drawn to believe in
   Christ but such as are sanctified by his Spirit. It is not in the power
   of any creature to incline us to God, or bring us to come to him by
   Christ. But this work is wholly reserved to the Spirit. And so the Lord
   himself doth powerfully bring to pass his own decrees, as by Christ
   redeeming, so by the Spirit sanctifying. The Spirit is the author both
   of faith and holiness. Saving grace is called a new creature: 2 Cor. v.
   17, Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature;' Eph. ii.
   10, For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
   works, which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them.'
   And to create is the work of a divine power. Creature and creator are
   relatives. And certainly the noblest creature, such as the new creature
   is, cannot be framed by any but God. It is called a new birth, and the
   new birth is only from the Spirit, John iii. 5, 6. Well, then, these
   are fitly coupled, the sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
   truth, that God's work may make way for ours.

   Secondly, There is the connection of concomitancy between the gospel
   and the Spirit. The Spirit only goeth along with the gospel, and no
   other doctrine; and so both external and internal grace are of God:
   John xvii. 17, Sanctify them by thy truth, thy word is truth.' It was
   fit that a supernatural doctrine should be accompanied with a
   supernatural operation and power. How else should it be known to be of
   God? The truth and the Spirit are inseparable companions. Where there
   is little of God known, there is little of his Spirit. As in the
   natural truth revealed to the heathens, somewhat God showed unto them,
   Rom. i. 19. In the darker revelation to the Jews there is but a fainter
   degree of the Spirit; but grace and truth come by Jesus Christ.' There
   goeth along with the doctrine of the gospel a mighty spirit of
   holiness; for thereby God would prove the verity and truth of this
   religion, and suitably to the rich mercy prepared for us in Christ.

   Thirdly, There is a subordination of faith to this work of the Spirit
   by the truth; for the greatest things work not till they be considered
   and believed: 1 Thes. ii. 13, Ye received it, not as the word of men,
   but as it is in truth, the word of God, which worketh effectually also
   in you that believe.' A sound belief produceth strong affections, and
   strong affections govern our practice and conversation. So that fitly
   are these things united, as the fruits of our election and means of
   salvation.

   2. Why this is the great matter of our thanksgiving to God. That I
   shall evidence in the following considerations:--

   [1.] That thanksgiving to God is a great and necessary duty, expressly
   enjoined by him, and expected from us: 1 Thes. v. 18, In everything
   give thanks, for this is the will of God concerning you in Christ
   Jesus.' When God hath interposed his will, all debates are silenced. If
   there were nothing else in the case, this is motive enough to a
   gracious heart; for the fundamental reason of all obedience is the will
   of God. Our thankfulness is no benefit to God, yet he is pleased with
   it, as it showeth our honesty and ingenuity. And to us Christians, the
   very life and soul of oar religion is thankfulness; therefore, God will
   have us continually exercised in it: Heb. xiii. 15, Let us offer the
   sacrifice of praise continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving
   thanks unto his name.' As our understanding was given us to think of
   God, and know him; so our speech was given us to speak of God, and
   praise him. We praise God for all his works, we give him thanks for
   such as are beneficial to us. In praise, we ascribe all honour,
   excellency, and perfection unto him. In giving thanks, we express what
   he hath done for ourselves or others. Now this must be done
   continually, for God is continually beneficial unto us, by daily
   mercies giving us new matter of praise and thanksgiving. Besides, there
   are some mercies so great, that they should never be forgotten.

   [2.] That we are to give thanks chiefly for spiritual and eternal
   mercies: Eph. i. 3, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
   places in Christ.' For we cannot give thanks rightly without a just
   esteem of the mercy we give thanks for. But spiritual and eternal
   mercies do much excel those that are temporal and transitory. We are
   bound to bless the Lord for temporal favours and the comforts of this
   life, but a renewed heart is most taken up with spiritual and heavenly
   blessings. A man may give thanks carnally as well as pray carnally. A
   carnal man in prayer giveth vent to the desires of the flesh, James iv.
   3. So in blessing God he may speak from the relish of the flesh; though
   usually carnal men seldom give thanks to God: Hosea xii. 8, I am become
   rich, I have found me out substance,' &c. Surely spiritual blessings
   should have the pre-eminence, because they concern our well-being, and
   they discriminate us from others, which temporal mercies do not:
   Eccles. ix. 1, 2, For all this I considered in my heart, even to
   declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works,
   are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all
   that is before them. All things come alike to all: there is one event
   to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, and to
   the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not;
   as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that
   feareth an oath.' The wicked have many of these mercies: Ps. xvii. 14,
   From men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose
   belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure; they are full of children,
   and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.' And they may own
   God in them as pleased, and well satisfied with the prosperity of the
   flesh, or as desirous to have more.

   [3.] That the best prospect we have of God's goodness to us, as to
   those spiritual mercies, is in election.

   (1.) There we see all our blessings in their rise, fountain, and bosom
   cause, which is the eternal love and grace of God. Dulcius ex ipso
   fonte--waters are sweetest and freshest in their fountain. There we see
   that antecedent love which provided a Redeemer for us, which should be
   matter of continual love and reverence to us, John iii. 16. There we
   see the rich preparations of grace in the new covenant, which could
   never have entered into our hearts if elective love had not provided
   them for us, 1 Cor. ii. 9. There we see what it was that disposed all
   those providences that conduced to our good birth, education,
   acquaintance, relations. Alas! we knew not the means of all these
   things, but elective love was at work for us, to cast all
   circumstances, that we might be best taken in our month, [3] Rom. viii.
   28. There we see what it was that made all the means effectual to draw
   us unto God: Jer. xxxi. 3, He loved us with an everlasting love.'

   (2.) It showeth us the Lord's distinguishing grace, and who it was that
   made us differ from others, who are left to perish in their sins. All
   are not called, and why we? John xiv. 22, Judas saith unto him (not
   Iscariot), Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and
   not unto the world?' Yea, many mighty and many noble are not called, 1
   Cor. i. 26. God taketh not all, nor many of the highest in esteem among
   men, not many wise and prudent: Mat. xi. 25, 26, At that time Jesus
   answered and said, I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
   because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
   revealed them unto babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy
   sight.' Yea, many others are left to perish by their own delusions. The
   reprobates are specula judicii divini. The judgments of God on the
   wicked do exceedingly amplify his mercies towards us. It was the mere
   elective love of God, issuing forth by his powerful and differencing
   grace, that put the distinction between us and others. Surely his
   peculiar love to ourselves doth most affect us.

   (3.) There we see that grace that doth take off all self-boasting: Eph.
   ii. 8, 9, For by grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of
   yourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should
   boast.' Elective love prevented all actual or foreseen worth in us; and
   from first to last it is carried on in a way of grace; the means, the
   efficacy, all is of grace. This was God's great end, that grace might
   be admired and esteemed by us, and be matter of eternal praise and
   thanksgiving: Eph. i. 6, To the praise of the glory of his grace,
   wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.' The whole design is
   to show us how we are beloved of God, and that we may love him again.

   Use 1. If election be the great matter of thanksgiving to God, then
   surely this doctrine should be heard in the church; for the life and
   soul of Christian religion is gratitude; and what feedeth gratitude is
   of great use unto us. Our gratitude doth not rise high enough till it
   come to the first cause that stirred and set all the wheels a-work in
   the business of our salvation. Surely this is a very profitable point.

   1. To detect the pride of man, for here we see the true and proper
   cause of difference between us and others: 1 Cor. iv. 7, Who maketh
   thee to differ?' The differencing grace of God, proceeding from his
   election, is the only true grace.

   2. Nothing more extolleth the glory of God in our salvation; for if man
   can assume nothing to himself, the glory alone redoundeth to God. The
   mere reason and cause why some are chosen and others passed by, is
   God's good pleasure: Mat. xi. 26, Even so, Father, because it pleased
   thee.' Christ himself consents to it, giveth thanks for it, as an act
   of free and undeserved mercy.

   3. No greater incentive to holiness; for here we see the absolute
   necessity of it, together with the strongest, sweetest motive to
   enforce it. (1.) The absolute necessity of it; because it is a
   necessary means to bring God's purposes to pass: Eph. i. 4, He hath
   chosen us, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in
   love.' He hath chosen none to enjoy everlasting glory after this life,
   but such as he hath chosen to be holy here. First, They must be
   sanctified and renewed by the Spirit, and then walk in all holy
   conversation and godliness. And whatever assurance of election is
   pretended unto them who lead an unholy life, it is but a vain
   presumption or ungrounded persuasion; yea, a strong delusion. Secondly,
   Here is the sweetest and strongest motive to enforce it, and that is
   the singular love of God, which breedeth in us a sincere love to God
   again, and all serious endeavours to approve ourselves to him in purity
   of living. There is no such constraining force in anything as there is
   in love: 2 Cor. v. 14, For the love of God constraineth us,' &c. And no
   such holiness as that which floweth from it; this is thankful and
   evangelical obedience.

   4. It is the ground of our solid comfort, in the midst of all the
   calamities and temptations of the present life; because our final
   happiness is appointed to us by God's electing love: Luke xii. 32, Fear
   not, little flock, for it is your father's good pleasure to give you
   the kingdom.' And this is accompanied with his active providence and
   care over us all the way thither. So that all things are sanctified to
   us, that we may be sanctified to God: Rom. viii. 28, And we know that
   all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who
   are the called according to his purpose.'

   Use 2. It showeth us that the elect have cause to bless God if they be
   chosen to salvation, though not to wealth, pleasure, and honour. These
   Thessalonians endured great afflictions for the gospel's sake, yet Paul
   looked upon himself as bound to give thanks always to God for them,
   because he had chosen them to salvation. God dispenseth his gifts
   variously. Some are, shall I say, chosen--or condemned rather?--to
   worldly felicity. It is the will of God they should attain great wealth
   and honour here; and will you envy them and repine against providence,
   though God hath reserved you for a better estate hereafter? Compare two
   places; one is Jer. xvii. 13, All that forsake thee shall be written in
   the earth;' the other is Luke x. 20, Rejoice in this, that your names
   are written in heaven.' Which is the better privilege to be written in
   earth, or to be written in heaven? to have a great name in the
   subsidy-book, or to have our names written in the book of life? The one
   is their punishment, the other your blessedness.

   Second use is exhortation. It presseth you to two things:--

   1. Put in for a share and interest in this mercy; that is to say, in
   the apostle's words, 2 Peter i. 10, Give diligence to make your calling
   and election sure.' God hath not told us who are elected and who are
   not; therefore our way is to accept of the general grace offered, and
   to devote and resign ourselves to God, and to depend upon the merits of
   our Redeemer, and put ourselves under the discipline of his Spirit in
   the use of the appointed means, humbly waiting for his renewing and
   reconciling grace, and every day more and more, by diligence in the
   holy and heavenly life, getting your interest more assured; for by this
   means do we come to know the purposed love of God, and that he hath not
   appointed us to wrath, but to obtain eternal salvation by our Lord
   Jesus Christ.' We need not say, Who shall go up to heaven to know the
   mind of God? Our election is known to us by our vocation, and our
   vocation by the fruits--our walking before him in holiness and
   righteousness all our days. Surely the knowledge of our election is a
   thing greatly to be desired, because our eternal happiness and all
   spiritual good things depend upon it. Election is the free love of God,
   by which he intendeth these blessings to us. This is manifested by
   calling, by which they begin to be applied to us; then the effectual
   operation which these blessings have in us discovereth calling, when we
   call on the name of Christ,' and depart from iniquity,' 2 Tim. ii. 19.

   2. We should praise, and admire, and esteem this glorious grace, and
   show our thankfulness both in word and deed.

   [1.] In word; because that is a means to kindle in our hearts the love
   of God, and to stir up a spiritual rejoicing in him: Ps. ciii. 1-3,
   Bless the Lord, my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy
   name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who
   forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases,' &c.

   [2.] Bat chiefly in deed: you are more obliged to live to God than
   other men, when, passing by thousands who, in outward respects, were
   better than you, and you as deep in sin as they, he, not only without,
   but against, all merit of yours, by his singular grace set you apart
   for himself. Shall I sin against God, and grieve his Spirit? No; let me
   glorify him as long as I have a day to live.

SERMON XII.

   Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of
   our Lord Jesus Christ.--2 Thes. II. 14.

   AFTER the doctrine of Antichrist, and God's dreadful spiritual
   judgments on his abettors and followers, the apostle interposeth some
   matter of consolation to the Thessalonians; as before he comforted them
   from their election, so now from their vocation, Therefore, as we saw
   the doctrine of election set forth in the former verse, with all its
   appendant branches and circumstances, so now the doctrine of vocation,
   with what belongeth to it. Here calling is set forth--(1.) By the
   author of it: he calleth you; that is, God, who from the beginning hath
   chosen you to salvation. (2.) The outward means: by our gospel. (3.)
   The end, which is double:--First, Subordinate, in the word whereunto,
   viz., to faith and holiness; Secondly, Ultimate: to the obtaining of
   the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Whereunto he called you,' &c.

   Doct. All that are elected by God are in time effectually called by
   faith and holiness [4] to obtain eternal life.

   1. I shall open effectual calling by what is said of it in the text.

   2. That all chosen by God are called in this way.

   1. Let me explain effectual calling. The author of it: he called you;'
   namely, God, spoken of in the former verse. I prove it by these two
   reasons:--(1.) None else hath authority to call; (2.) None else hath
   power to call.

   [1.] Authority to call, either to duties or privileges; for calling is
   an earnest invitation to duties upon the offer of several privileges.

   (1.) Duties: God is our proper Lord and rightful sovereign. He may
   justly challenge our obedience. Being our Creator, he is our owner; and
   being our owner, he is our sovereign and lawgiver, and may enact what
   laws he pleaseth. Certainly creation giveth him an interest in us; for
   every man taketh himself to have an authority over what he hath made,
   to dispose of it as he pleaseth. Now he that properly made all things
   is God. Man is said to make a thing as he bestoweth art upon it, but
   God bestoweth being upon it. A potter may form his clay into what
   vessel he pleaseth, to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto
   dishonour, Rom. ix. 21; that is, either a dish for food or a vessel to
   serve the vilest uses of nature, for meat or excrements. But we speak
   of rational creatures that are capable of proper government. Surely God
   made us, and hath a right to govern us. Our parents are but instruments
   of his providence; they know not how the child is framed in the womb,
   &c. Now he calleth upon us to do our duty with original supreme
   authority. We may refuse others; if they speak not to us in his name,
   they have no right over our consciences, to impose new duties upon us:
   James iv. 12, There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to
   destroy.' Now his calling being a powerful excitation to do our duty,
   it originally belongeth to God.

   (2.) As to privileges: The blessings God offereth are so great and
   glorious, that none else can give us a right to them but God; and the
   soul can have no security that it doth not usurp and intrude upon the
   possession of things that belong not to us till we have his warrant. As
   the apostle speaketh of an office, Heb. v. 4, No man taketh this honour
   unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron;' so it is
   true of all prerogatives; we have no leave to assume and take the
   honour of them to ourselves till we are called of God: that is our
   warrant. None came to the wedding-feast till they were bidden, Mat.
   xxii., or went into the vineyard till they were hired, Mat. xx. This is
   the difference between duties and privileges: that any man, who will
   prefer that office of charity and love to us, may excite us to our
   duties, to unquestionable duties, due from the creature to the Creator;
   but no man can assure us of right to privileges without the Creator's
   leave. Man cannot make that to be a necessary duty to the Creator which
   is not. But man may warn us of our danger when we disobey God; but man
   cannot assure us of our right to such privileges without God's grant.
   Therefore certainly it is God that must call us

   [2.] None else can have power; for to calling there is necessary not
   only the invitations of the word, but also the effectual operation or
   the Spirit. None else can change the heart. A Christian is nothing, and
   hath nothing, but what God is pleased to work in him by his divine
   power: 2 Peter i. 3, According as his divine power hath given us all
   things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
   him that hath called us to glory and virtue.' It is a work of an
   infinite power to give grace to graceless souls, to make those that are
   sensual and worldly to become spiritual and heavenly, there being so
   much opposition to hinder that work; for such is the corruption of
   men's hearts, the power of Satan over us, that he keepeth possession
   till a stronger than he overcometh him, Luke xi. 21. Therefore it is
   always made the work of his power, who calleth the things that are not
   as though they were,' Rom. iv. 17. It is still ascribed to his creating
   power; either the illumination of the mind, 2 Cor. iv. 6, For God, who
   commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our
   hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
   face of Jesus Christ;' or inclinations of the heart, Eph. ii. 10. We
   can neither think, nor effect, nor pursue spiritual and heavenly things
   without it. Therefore certainly it is God that calleth us.

   2. The outward means: by our gospel.' Where--(1.) Consider the means
   itself: the gospel; (2.) The interest which the apostle challengeth in
   it: our gospel.

   [1.] The means itself: the gospel. This God useth:--

   (1.) Because if God will call and invite the creature by his duty to
   his happiness, it is necessary that his call should be evident to the
   creature by some visible sign. Now, the natural duty of man is much
   seen by the creation: Rom. i. 19, Because that which may be known of
   God is manifest in them, for God hath showed it unto them;' Ps. xix. 1,
   2, The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his
   handiwork: day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth
   knowledge.' But this call is made to man fallen, as a remedy to his
   lapsed estate, which, depending on the free grace of God, can only be
   known by his revelation, conveyed to us by extra ordinary messengers,
   such as Christ, who was the principal revealer of the doctrine of God
   for the saving of the world, and him God authorised and sealed to this
   end: John vi. 27, Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that
   meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall
   give unto you; for him hath God the Father sealed.' And then by the
   apostles, who were instituted by Christ, and sent forth to proselytise
   the world to the obedience of God; and they were also authorised from
   heaven by divers signs and wonders, as long as it was necessary to use
   that dispensation for the confirmation of their message, and to show
   how dangerous it was to neglect a doctrine so useful to mankind, and
   suitable to their great necessities, and so owned by God, Heb. ii. 3,
   4. Therefore by the gospel God called them to this grace.

   (2.) To convince and stop their mouths that refuse this calling, for
   the gospel bringeth grace home to us, and leaveth it upon our choice.
   If we will accept it, well and good; if not, we justly deserve to be
   rejected forever: Acts xiii. 26, To you is this word of salvation
   sent.' What say you to it? God hath sent a gracious message to you in
   particular; will you accept or refuse? Acts iii. 26, He hath sent him
   to you, to bless every one of you,' &c. It doth excite all, and every
   man, to look after the recovery of his lapsed estate; surely God doth
   you no wrong if he severely punish your refusal after he hath invited
   you to his grace in Christ. Great is the misery of those that refuse
   this call: None of those that were bidden shall taste of my supper,'
   Luke xiv. 24. They are not only excluded from happiness, but they incur
   extreme wrath and misery: Prov. i. 24-26, Because I have called, and ye
   refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have
   set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will
   laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh.'

   (3.) Because to the elect he will deal congruously, and preserve the
   liberty of his own workmanship, and therefore dealeth with man as man;
   doth not compel us to be good whether we will or no, but doth at the
   same time teach and draw us: John vi. 44, 45, No man can come unto me,
   except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him: and I will raise him
   up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be
   all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath
   learned of the Father, cometh unto me; sweetly attempering the means to
   our liberty, but accompanying them with his powerful grace: Acts xi.
   21, The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed,
   and turned to the Lord.' It is God doth all, prospering the labours of
   his servants. So Acts xvi. 14, God opened the heart of Lydia, so that
   she attended unto the things spoken by Paul.' God opened her heart, but
   by the things spoken by Paul. And God loveth to associate or accompany
   his power with his own means: Rom. i. 16, It is the power of God unto
   salvation.'

   [2.] The interest the apostle challengeth in it: our gospel. Doth it
   not derogate from the authority of it to appropriate it to any man? I
   answer--No. Elsewhere it is called God's gospel: The glorious gospel of
   the blessed God,' 1 Tim. i. 11. He is the author. It is not an
   invention of man, but a secret that came from the bosom of God. Again,
   it is called Christ's gospel: The gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,' 2
   Thes. i. 8; as the principal sub-revealer, who made known unto us most
   fully the mind of God. And then on the apostles, who were instruments
   chosen and intrusted by Christ to declare it to the world both by word
   and writing. The scripture is an authentic record, wherein all things
   are delivered to us both concerning our duties and privileges.
   Therefore, when he saith our gospel, he doth not mean it of principal
   revelation, but in regard of dispensation and trust: 1 Tim. i. 11, The
   glorious gospel of the blessed God is committed to my trust.' Therefore
   this word our gospel is--(1.) A word of fidelity, that argued the
   conscience to this duty, that owneth the trust committed to him, and
   that this was his chief work and charge: 1 Cor. ix. 17, A dispensation
   of the gospel is committed unto me.' (2.) It is a word of esteem, love,
   and affection; what we love we call ours: Rom. xvi. 25, Now to him that
   is able to stablish you according to my gospel,' Paul was glad he had
   such interest in it as to be a preacher of it; and believers should be
   glad they are partakers of the benefit: Eph. i. 13, In whom ye trusted,
   after ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.' It is
   theirs and ours. Oh, blessed be God for this! (3.) It is a word
   importing diligence--our gospel; that which he preached with so much
   labour and hazard: he followed this work close: Acts xx. 24, I count
   not my life dear, that I may finish my course with joy, and the
   ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel
   of the grace of God.' He was willing to die and suffer anything for the
   gospel's sake. (4.) The consent and harmony between him and the rest of
   the apostles. Sometimes he calleth it my gospel, to assert his own
   apostolical authority, as Rom. ii. 16; sometimes our gospel, 2 Cor. iv.
   3, to note their common consent, who were the authorised messengers of
   our Lord Jesus Christ. It is our gospel, the same jointly attested by
   all Christ's chosen messengers.

   3. The ends of this calling. They are either subordinate or ultimate.

   First, Subordinate: in the word Whereunto he hath called you;' that is,
   to faith, holiness, and salvation; we are called to all.

   [1.] God calleth us to the faith of the gospel; he hath not only
   ordained us to believe, but called us to believe. Without calling there
   can be no faith: Rom. x. 14, How shall they believe in him of whom they
   have not heard?' But upon calling there must be faith, or else we make
   void the dispensation of God which we are under.

   (1.) There must be a belief of the gospel in general. The voice of the
   creatures calleth upon the Gentiles to believe an infinite, eternal
   power, that made man and all things; and the condemnation of the
   Gentile world is that they know not God, and glorify not God as God,
   after this revelation made to them. But to believe in Christ is a
   mystery to nature, and dependeth upon God's special revelation in the
   gospel. Therefore the external and internal power of the Spirit
   accompanieth it, to convince the world that it is sin not to believe in
   Christ--the external power in miracles, and the internal in the
   illumination of the mind: John xvi. 9, The Spirit shall convince the
   world of sin, because they believe not in me;' that is, receive not the
   faith of the gospel, or believe not that Christ was the true Messiah,
   the great prophet and doctor of the church.

   (2.) This call doth aim at not only a belief of the truth of the gospel
   in general, but also a particular affiance in Christ according to the
   terms of the new covenant. General assent to the truth of the gospel is
   only considerable as it leadeth on other things. Now, that I may not
   wander, I will refer them to two things--(1.) A fiducial assent; (2.)
   An obediential confidence. This is the belief of the truth we are
   called unto.

   (1st.) The assent must be fiducial, or accompanied with a trust in
   Christ: Eph. i. 13, In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the
   word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.' The meaning is, the
   Gentiles, after they heard the gospel and believed the truth, they did
   trust themselves in the hands of Christ, to be brought by his saving
   and healing methods to eternal happiness. It is a mighty thing to have
   such a belief as may produce trust, or a venturing ourselves in the
   hands of Christ against all hazards, and, whatever befalleth us, be
   content to save our souls on his terms. This breedeth holy security or
   courage: 2 Tim. i. 12, For I know whom I have believed, and I am
   persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him
   against that day.'

   (2dly.) This confidence must be obediential, not a devout sloth or
   carelessness. To trust in his mercies and neglect his precepts crosseth
   the tenor of his covenant: Ps. cxix. 60, I made haste, and delayed not
   to keep thy commandments.' It is true religion when faith, hope, and
   love concur: Jude, vers. 20, 21, But ye, beloved, building up
   yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep
   yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
   Christ unto eternal life.' I know there is a trusting in his pardon for
   our failings, and that justification is a great privilege, as well as
   salvation; but pardon is promised to the sincere, that with an honest
   heart perform their duty: Ps. xxxii. 2, Blessed is the man to whom the
   Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile;' and
   Rom. viii. 1, There is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus,
   who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.' So that still our
   confidence in Christ must be obediential.

   [2.] We are called to holiness; this is everywhere asserted in the
   scripture: 1 Thes. iv. 7, For God hath not called us to uncleanness,
   but to holiness.' And it enforceth it on several grounds; as--

   (1.) That there may be a likeness between the person calling and the
   persons called: 1 Peter i. 15, But as he that called you is holy, so be
   ye holy in all manner of conversation.' It is true religion to imitate
   what we worship; for knowledge and esteem always work an assimilation;
   and therefore, if we know the true God, and love him, we will study to
   be like him. Certainly, we have not a true knowledge of God if we do
   not know him to be a pure and holy God. He hath showed it in his laws,
   showed in his providence, and showed in his gospel by which we are
   called. The gods of the heathen taught sin by their own example. Their
   impure lives are recorded by their poets. Austin telleth us of a young
   man who was incited to wantonness by seeing the picture of Jupiter on
   the wall committing adultery. Quo pacto non faceret, cum in templo
   adorare cogeretur Jovem potius Catonem quam? But our God is pure, as
   appeareth by his laws, which are all holy, just, and good,' Ps. cxix.
   140. Surely such holy precepts could come from none but a pure and holy
   God. As also by the work of his Spirit on his people: Eph. iv. 24, And
   that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness
   and true holiness;' and 2 Cor. iii. 18, We all, with open face,
   beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
   same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.' He
   puts us into a nature that is very tender and shy of sin, troubled at
   it in others: 2 Peter ii. 7, 8, And delivered just Lot, vexed with the
   filthy conversation of the wicked; for that righteous man dwelling
   amongst them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day
   to day with their unlawful deeds.' He that made the eye, shall not he
   see? He that put into us a clean heart, is not he pure and holy? This
   appeareth also by the dispensations of his providence: Hab. i. 13, Thou
   art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.
   Wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and boldest
   thy tongue, when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous
   than he?' Judgments on sinners, so on his own people: Prov. xi. 31,
   Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in earth; much more the
   wicked and the sinner.' As, for instance, in David: the child died, his
   daughter is deflowered, Amnon slain, Absalom is in rebellion, his wives
   ravished, himself banished from his house and kingdom. Eli's sons
   slain, the ark taken, his daughter-in-law died, himself brake his neck.
   But chiefly in the very foundation of the gospel: the Son of God dieth
   a shameful, painful, accursed death before God would relax the rigour
   of his law and set afoot the gospel, and all that there might be a
   perfect demonstration of his justice and holiness, and displeasure
   against sin: Rom. viii. 3, For what the law could not do, in that it
   was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of
   sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin, in the flesh.'

   (2.) The very nature of this calling enforceth this sanctification, or
   setting man apart from a common to a sacred use; for it is a calling us
   not only from misery to happiness, but from sin to holiness, and the
   one is indispensably necessary to the other; for none but those who are
   in a holy estate can be in a blessed condition. Our calling is
   sometimes called a heavenly calling,' Heb. iii. 1; sometimes an holy
   calling,' 2 Tim. i. 9. Therefore the chief subordinate end is holiness:
   Rom. i. 7, Called to be saints,'--from the devil, the world, and the
   flesh, to God.

   (3.) The grace and favour which is showed in our calling obligeth us to
   be holy in point of gratitude; for when we consider in what a sinful
   estate God found us, how freely he loved us, and that with a
   discriminating, differencing love, when he passed by others worthier
   than we, and to what estate he is ready to advance us--to the enjoyment
   of himself, amongst all those that are sanctified by faith;--all these
   are as so many strong bonds and obligations upon us to walk worthy of
   God, who hath called us to his kingdom and glory in Jesus Christ,' 1
   Thes. ii. 12--worthy of his grace in calling; worthy of the glory to
   which we are called; that is, with the worthiness of condecency, not of
   condignity. We cannot fully answer this grace, but we must do that
   which will become it.

   (4.) This calling enableth us to be holy, because it giveth us all
   things necessary both to holiness of heart and life: 2 Peter i. 3,
   According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that
   pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath
   called us to glory and virtue.' Now this grace must not lie idle,
   otherwise we receive the Spirit in vain.

   Secondly, The ultimate end: To obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus
   Christ.' The same expression in 1 Peter v. 10, The God of all grace,
   who hath called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus.' It is his
   glory.' Mark--(1.) Here is glory; (2.) It is the glory of our Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   [1.] It is glory for body and soul. The glory is so great we cannot
   utter it, and conceive it. Now a little is revealed to us, but then it
   shall be revealed in us. (1.) The soul is not annihilated after death,
   nor doth it sleep till the resurrection, nor is it detained by the way
   from immediate passing into glory; but as soon as it is loosed from the
   body, is admitted into God's presence, and gathered unto the souls of
   just men made perfect, where it seeth God and loveth him, and enjoyeth
   what it seeth and loveth; for as soon as we are loosed from the body,
   we are present with the Lord. And therefore the first benefit we
   receive in the other world is the salvation of the soul: 1 Peter i, 9,
   Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.' It
   flitteth hence to God. (2.) The body hath its glory also in due time;
   for when it is raised up out of the grave, it will be another kind of
   body than we now have, both for impassibility, clarity, agility--for
   impassibility, called incorruption; clarity, called glory; agility,
   called power; subtilty, called a spiritual body by the apostle: 1 Cor.
   xv. 42, 43, It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it
   is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown a natural body,
   it is raised a spiritual body':--

   (1.) Impassability doth not only exclude corruption, for so the bodies
   of the damned are preserved for ever; but all grievances and pain: Rev.
   xxi. 4, There shall not be any more pain.'

   (2.) For glory, a shining brightness: Mat. xiii. 43, The righteous
   shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of the Father.' Stephen's face
   shone, in this life, as it were the face of an angel,' Acts vi. 15. And
   Moses' face shone by converse with God in the mount, Exod. xxxiv. 30.
   Our bodies shall be likened unto his glorious body,' Phil. iii. 21. In
   the transfiguration, His face did shine as the sun, and his raiment did
   shine as the light.'

   (3.) For vigour, activity, and strength. It shall always be in the
   height and excellency of it. God preserved Moses' natural vigour for a
   long time, Deut. xxxiv. 7; but glorified bodies shall for ever remain
   in an eternal spring of youth.

   (4.) Subtilty, a spiritual body. Here we live an animal life, after the
   manner of sensitive creatures, maintained by meat, drink, sleep; but
   hereafter the body shall live after the manner of spirits, having no
   need or use of these things. There we are isa'ngeloi, as the angels of
   God.' Mat. xxii. 30; and 1 Cor. vi. 19, Our bodies are the temple of
   the Holy Ghost.' Well, then, this is the glory put upon us.

   [2.] Why is it called the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ?'

   (1.) It is purchased by Christ. We were redeemed or bought by the price
   of his blood, that we might attain to this glory: Eph. i. 7, In whom we
   have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins,
   according to the riches of his grace.'

   (2.) It is promised by Christ: John x. 28, I give unto them eternal
   life, and they shall never perish.' All that obey this call have
   eternal life already begun, nay, completed: 1 John ii. 25, And this is
   the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.'

   (3.) It is prayed for by Christ, which is a copy of his intercession:
   John xvii. 14, Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be
   with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given
   me.'

   (4.) It is actually bestowed by Christ on his followers and called
   people. He receiveth our departing souls as soon as they flit out of
   the body: Acts vii. 59, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.' They are with
   him: Phil. i. 23, and 2 Cor. v. 8, when absent from the body,' they are
   present with the Lord,' which is a mighty comfort to us. At the last
   day he will solemnly introduce us into heaven: John xiv. 3, I will come
   again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there ye may be
   also.' The great shepherd of the sheep will lead the flock into their
   everlasting fold.

   (5.) We have not only glory by Christ, but with Christ. We shall have
   the same glory Christ now hath, but in our measure; the same glory in
   kind whereunto Christ's humanity is advanced, referring to him only his
   privilege in the degree. So Rom. viii. 17, And if children, then heirs,
   heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be that we suffer with
   him, that we may be also glorified together;' Rev. iii. 21, To him that
   overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also
   overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.' We share with
   him in his own blessedness, so far as we are capable.

   II. That all those who are elected and chosen by God are thus called.
   Election and vocation have a great respect one to another; and though
   we cannot say that none are called that are not elected, for the Lord
   calleth others not only by the voice of nature, but the gospel: Mat.
   xxii. 14, Many are called, but few are chosen;' yet we may say that
   none are chosen, but they are in time called, so that vocation is, as
   it were, actual election. They are often put one for another; as John
   xv. 19, I have chosen you out of the world; therefore the world hateth
   you;' that is, called them, or pursued his choice. So 1 Cor. i. 26, Ye
   see your calling, brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh, not
   many noble, not many mighty are called: for God hath chosen the foolish
   things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak
   things of the world to confound the things which are mighty,' ver. 27;
   as if choosing and calling were all one. So Rom. xi. 28, 29, As
   concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but as touching
   the election, they are beloved for the Father's sake: for the gifts and
   calling of God are without repentance.' So that calling is an
   infallible consequent of election. And Rom. viii. 30, Whom he did
   predestinate, them he also called.' Reason showeth it. (1.) Effectual
   calling is that powerful operation of God, wherein he beginneth to
   execute the purposes of his grace: Rom. viii. 28, And we know that all
   things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
   the called according to his purpose' (kata` pro'thesin). The first
   discovery of it to the creature is by drawing us to himself. (2.) This
   act proceedeth immediately from his choice, as anteceding all that we
   can do, all worthiness of ours, or supposed worthiness: 2 Tim. i. 9,
   Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to
   our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given
   us in Christ Jesus, before the world began.' Nothing induced God to do
   it on our part, for what good thing could we do before we were made
   good by calling? (3.) The effect doth infallibly follow: John vi. 37,
   All that the Father hath given me shall come to me, and him that cometh
   to me I will in no wise cast out.' In due time they are called, and are
   obedient to the call, Rom. viii. 28.

   Use 1. If it be so, then here is advice to all.

   1. Let us apply ourselves to the means with reverence and seriousness;
   because God's power is shown in them, in converting souls to himself:
   Ps. lxv. 4, Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to draw
   nigh unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts.' It is a good thing to
   be in grace's way. The means have a ministerial efficacy: Acts xiv. 1,
   They so spake, that a great multitude of the Jews and Greeks believed;'
   with such clearness and force; so far God is with the minister. A dart
   flung by a skilful hand will pierce deeper than by its own weight. But
   yet, if you can but tarry, the hand of the Lord may be with you also.
   You do not know the seasons of the Lord's grace; all are not called at
   the first hour; some lie long at the pool, but yet wait still. Ere ever
   you are aware, the Holy Ghost may fall upon you and open your hearts.
   That heavenly doctrine may have its effect upon you.

   2. Let us mind not only privileges, but duties. We have great
   privileges; we are called to enjoy sweet fellowship with Christ here: 1
   Cor. i. 9, Faithful is he who hath called you to the communion of
   Christ Jesus our Lord,' and to a glorious estate hereafter. But we are
   also called to the sanctification of the Spirit and the belief of the
   truth; and we cannot obtain the one without the other. Do not so mind
   comfort as to slight holiness, and divide one part of your calling from
   the other. Comfort is consequent to holiness, and followeth it as heat
   doth fire. The Spirit is more necessarily a sanctifier than a
   comforter; for our duty and obedience to God is a greater thing than
   our own peace. Holiness is the image of God upon the soul, and the
   blessed perfection wherein we were created: Gen. i. 27, So God created
   man in his own image.' And when it was lost by sin, Christ came and
   paid our ransom, that he might renew us by his Spirit; Titus iii. 5,
   According to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and
   renewing of the Holy Ghost.' Yea, much of our everlasting blessedness
   lieth in it. For heaven is to be looked upon not only as a state of
   complete felicity, but exact holiness: 1 John iii. 2, We know that when
   he doth appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is;'
   Eph. v. 27, That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
   having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy
   and without blemish.' Then it is a glorious church. Christ hath done
   his whole work. Holiness is the beauty of God himself, Exod. xv. 11,
   and puts an excellency on us, if we love it, and imitate it: Prov. xii.
   26, The righteous is more excel lent than his neighbour: but the way of
   the wicked seduceth them.' We do not only excel other men, but we are
   more amiable in the sight of God: Prov. xi. 20, The upright is his
   delight.' In short, it is a part of salvation itself, and a means to
   that which remaineth: Acts xxvi. 18, Inheritance among them which are
   sanctified by faith in Christ Jesus.'

   3. Let us reflect upon ourselves. Have we God's call? Have we obeyed
   the gospel? This will clear up your election to you: 2 Peter i. 10,
   Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
   election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.' Do you
   find such a belief wrought in you by the Spirit as begins in brokenness
   of heart, and ends in holiness? For Christ came to call sinners to
   repentance,' Mat. ix. 13; that is, men sensible of sin to holiness of
   heart and life; to return to God, that we may first live to him, and
   then with him.

   4. To improve the belief of the glory promised. (1.) To sweeten
   obedience, or a cause of holiness which for the present is so tedious
   to the flesh. Now here is our labour, hereafter our recompense, 1 Cor.
   xv. 58. Every day we should grow more meet for his glory, Col. i. 12.
   (2.) To a contempt of all worldly things, good or evil. If good, many
   are pleased with this world's good things, but have no affection to
   spiritual and heavenly things; like the rebellious Israelites, who more
   desired the onions and garlic of Egypt than the milk and honey of the
   promised land, or the celestial manna, Num. xi. 5, 6; worse than
   prodigals, that rest more satisfied with husks of swine, than bread
   which is in their father's house: they have their good things. Now, we
   should remember we are called off from these things, from dreggy
   contentments, base enjoyments, to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
   (3.) The evils of the world--crosses, afflictions: After ye have
   suffered a while, the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his
   eternal glory by Christ Jesus, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen,
   settle you;' and 2 Tim. ii. 11, 12, It is a faithful saying: for if we
   be dead with him, we shall also live with him: if we suffer, we shall
   also reign with him.' Our afflictions are both breves and leves, light
   and momentary: 2 Cor. iv. 17, For our light affliction, which is but
   for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
   glory.' Our sufferings are small if compared with the reward; the time
   short, if compared with eternity. There is a twofold eternity--that
   eternal death which the wicked must endure; that eternal life which we
   enter into. This should sweeten all bitter waters. (4.) To dispose and
   prepare us for death. The contemplation of immortality hath left strong
   impressions on the hearts of heathens; some burnt themselves as
   impatient to tarry longer. If a dark view, vain hope cause this, what
   should a sure promise and earnest of the Spirit do?

   Use 2. To the called. (1.) Bless God for this calling. The woful estate
   out of which we are called, and the blessed estate into which we are
   entered, compared together, should make us wonder: 1 Peter ii. 9, Ye
   should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of
   darkness into his marvellous light.' (2.) Walk answerably: Eph. iv. 1,
   I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy
   of the vocation wherewith ye are called.' And 1 Thes. ii. 12, That ye
   would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and
   glory.'

SERMON XIII.

   Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have
   been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.--2 Thes. II. 15.

   THE apostle, after he had comforted the Thessalonians, he exhorteth
   them to constancy in the truth, whatever temptations they had to the
   contrary. The comforts he propoundeth to them were taken--(1.) From
   their election, ver. 13; (2.) From their vocation, ver. 14. His
   exhortation is to perseverance: Therefore, brethren,' &c.

   In the words observe:--

   1. The illative particle, therefore; because God hath chosen you and
   called you, and given you such advantages against error and seduction.

   2. The duty inferred: ste'kete, stand fast. It is a military word; you
   have the same in other places: 1 Cor. xvi. 13, Watch ye, stand ye
   fast,' &c.; Eph. vi. 14, Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about
   with truth.' The word intimateth perseverance.

   3. The means of perseverance: hold the traditions which you have been
   taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

   Where observe:--(1.) The act; (2.) The object.

   1. The act: krateite, hold with strong hand. The word implieth a
   forcible holding against assaults, whether of error or persecution. The
   Thessalonians were assaulted in both kinds; the heathens persecuted
   them, and some were gone abroad that began the mystery of iniquity, and
   were ready to pervert them.

   2. The object, which is propounded--(1.) By a common and general term:
   The traditions which ye have been taught.' (2.) By a distribution:
   Whether by word, or our epistle.'

   1. The common and general term, The traditions which ye have been
   taught.' There are two sorts of traditions--human and divine.

   First, Human traditions are certain external observances instituted by
   men, and delivered from hand to hand, from progenitors to their
   posterity. These may be either besides or contrary to the word of God.
   (1.) Beside the word, as the institutions of the family of the
   Rechabites, in the observance of which, from father to son, they were
   so exact and punctual, that God produceth their example to shame the
   disobedience of his people; Jer. xxxv. 6, 7, Jonadab the son of Rechab
   our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, nor build
   houses, nor plant vineyards,' &c. (2.) Contrary to the word of God,
   such as were those of the pharisees: Mat. xv. 3, Why transgress ye the
   commandment of God by your traditions?' Human inventions in religion
   are contrary to, and destructive of, divine laws.

   Secondly, Traditions divine are either heavenly doctrines revealed by
   God, or institutions and ordinances appointed by him for the use of the
   church. These are the rule and ground of our faith, worship, and
   obedience. The whole doctrine of the gospel is a tradition delivered
   and conveyed to us by fit messengers, such as the apostles were: 1 Cor.
   xi. 2, Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
   and keep the ordinances [marg. traditions] as I delivered them to you.'
   So that holding the traditions is nothing else but perseverance in
   apostolical doctrine.

   2. The distribution, that no cheats might be put upon them under any
   pretence; therefore he saith, Whether by word, or our epistle;' that
   is, by word of mouth when present, or by epistle when absent; and he
   saith, not epistles, but epistle, as alluding to the former he wrote
   unto them. They were bound to yield to both alike credence and
   obedience; for, whether in speaking or writing, the apostolical
   authority was the same. To improve this verse for your benefit, I shall
   lay down several propositions.

   I. That whatever assurance we have of God's preserving us in the truth,
   yet we are bound to use diligence and caution.

   II. Our diligence and caution is to be employed about this, that we may
   stand fast in the faith of Christ, and the profession and practice of
   godliness.

   III. That the means of standing fast in the faith of Christ, and the
   profession and practice of godliness, is by holding the traditions
   which were taught by the holy apostles.

   IV. That while the apostles were in being, there were two ways of
   delivering the truth--by word of mouth and writing.

   V. That now when they are long since gone to God, and we cannot receive
   from them the doctrine of life by word of mouth, we must stick to the
   scriptures or written word.

   I. That whatever assurance we have of God's preserving us in the truth,
   yet we are bound to use diligence and caution. For the apostle had said
   that God had chosen and called them to the belief of the truth,' and
   yet saith, Therefore, brethren, stand fast.'

   First, Reason will tell us that when we intend an end, we must use the
   means; otherwise the bare intention and desire would suffice, and to
   the accomplishing of any effect, we need no more than to will it; and
   the sluggard would be the wisest man in the world, who is full of
   wishings and wouldings, though his hands refuse to labour. But common
   experience showeth that the end cannot be obtained without a diligent
   use of the means: Prov. xiii. 4, The soul of the sluggard desireth, and
   hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat:' that is,
   rewarded with the intended benefit.

   Secondly, The business in hand is, whether God's election, calling, or
   promise, doth so secure the end to us, as that we need not be so
   careful in the diligent use of means? Such a notion or conceit there
   may be in the hearts of men, therefore let us attack it a little by
   these considerations:--

   1. God's decree is both of end and means, for all his purposes are
   executed by fit means. He that hath chosen us to salvation, bringeth it
   about by the belief of the truth, and sanctification of the Spirit, 2
   Thes. ii. 13; and without faith and holiness no man shall see God, and
   escape condemnation. God had assured Paul that there should be no loss
   of any man's life among them, except of the ship,' Acts xxvii. 22. And
   yet afterwards, ver. 31, Paul telleth them, Except these abide in the
   ship, ye cannot be saved.' How could that assurance given to Paul from
   God, and Paul's caution to the mariners, stand together? Doth the
   purpose of God depend upon the uncertain will and actions of men? I
   answer--Not as a cause, from whence it receiveth its force and
   strength; but as a means, appointed also by God to the execution of his
   decree. For by the same decree God appointeth the event, what he will
   do, and the means by which he will have it to be done: and the Lord
   revealing by his word this conjunction of end and means, there is a
   necessity of duty lying upon man to use these means, and not to expect
   the end without them. God intended to save all in the ship, and yet the
   mariners must abide in the ship; therefore, what God hath joined
   together, let no man separate. If we separate these things, God doth
   not change his counsel, but we pervert his order to our own
   destruction.

   2. God, that hath bidden us to believe his promises, hath forbidden us
   to tempt his providence, Mat. iv. 7. Now we tempt God when we desire
   him to give an extraordinary proof of his care over us, when ordinary
   means will serve the turn, or be useful to us.

   3. Though the means seem to have no connection with the end, yet, if
   God hath enjoined them for that end, we must use them. As in the
   instance of Naaman; God was resolved to cure him, but Naaman must take
   his prescribed way, though against his own fancy and conceit: 2 Kings
   v. 10, Wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again unto
   thee, and thou shalt be clean;' compare ver. 13, If the prophet had
   bidden thee to do some great thing,' &c. So John xiii. 6, 7, Peter must
   submit to be washed, though he could not see the benefit of it. So John
   ix. 6, 7, the blind man must submit to have his eyes anointed with
   clay, and wash in the pool of Siloam; though the clay seemed to put out
   his eyes, rather than cure them, and the pool could not wash away his
   blindness; but means appointed by God must be used, whatever
   improbabilities are apprehended by us.

   4. That when God's will is expressly declared concerning the event, yet
   he will have the means used. As, for instance, 2 Kings xx. 5-7; God was
   absolutely resolved to add fifteen years more to Hezekiah's life, yet
   he must take a lump of figs and lay it on the boil; which plainly
   showeth that no promise on God's part, nor assurance on ours, hindereth
   the use of means. God will work by them, not without them.

   5. In spiritual things, assurance of the event is an encouragement to
   industry, not a pretence to sloth: 1 John ii. 27, 28, Ye shall abide in
   him: and now, little children, abide in him.' The promise of
   perseverance doth encourage us to use endeavours that we may persevere,
   and quicken diligence rather than nourish security, or open a gap to
   carnal liberty: 1 Cor. ix. 26, I run not as one that is uncertain.' We
   are the more earnest, because we are assured the means shall not be
   uneffectual.

   II. Our duty is to stand fast in the faith of Christ and profession of
   godliness, whatever temptations we have to the contrary. Stand fast
   being a military word, it alludeth to a soldier's keeping his ground,
   and is opposed to two things:--(1.) A cowardly flight; (2.) A
   treacherous revolt.

   1. A cowardly flight implieth our being overcome in the evil day, by
   the many afflictions that befall us for the truth's sake: Eph. vi. 13,
   Wherefore take to you the whole armour of God, that you may be able to
   withstand in the evil day;' that after ye have done all things, ye may
   stand. Their temptation was the many troubles and persecutions that
   befell them, called there the evil day.' Their defence lay in the whole
   armour of God,' which is there made of six pieces:--The girdle of truth
   or sincerity, which is a strength to us as a girdle to the loins; the
   breastplate of righteousness, or a holy inclination and desire to
   perform our duty to God in all things; and the shield of faith, or a
   steadfast adhering to the truths of the gospel, whether delivered in a
   way of command, promise, or threatening; the helmet of hope, or a
   certain and desirous expectation of the promised glory; the shoe of the
   preparation of the gospel of peace, which is a readiness to endure all
   encounters for Christ's sake, who hath made our peace with God; and the
   sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Now, if we take this
   armour and use it in our conflicts, what doth it serve for? To
   withstand and stand. The first is the act of a soldier, the second is
   the posture of a conqueror. Here is withstanding till the field be won,
   and then standing when the day of evil is over. Here we make our way to
   heaven by conflict and conquest, and hereafter we triumph.

   2. A treacherous revolt, or yielding to the enemy, by complying with
   those things which are against the interest of Christ and his kingdom
   for advantage-sake: 2 Tim. iv. 10, Demas hath forsaken us, and loved
   the present world.' Backsliders in heart are the worst sort of
   apostates. Such as lose their affection to God, and delight in his
   ways, and esteem not of his glorious recompenses, for a little
   pleasure, profit, or pomp of living; sell their birthright for one
   morsel of meat, Heb. xii. 15, 16. Some fail in their understandings,
   but most miscarry by the perverse inclination of their wills; they are
   carnal worldly hypocrites that never thoroughly mortified the fleshly
   mind, prize things as they are commodious to the flesh, and will save
   them from sufferings. The bias of such men's hearts doth easily prevail
   against the light of their understandings.

   III. The means of standing fast is, by holding the traditions which
   were taught by the holy apostles. Here I will prove--(1.) That the
   doctrine of Christianity taught by the apostles is a tradition; (2.)
   That holding this tradition by strong hand, when others wrest it from
   us, is the means of our perseverance.

   1. That the doctrine of Christianity is a tradition, I prove it by two
   arguments:--

   First, Matters not evident by the light of nature, nor immediately
   revealed to us by God, must be either an invention or a tradition. An
   invention is something in religion not evident by natural light, nor
   agreeable to sound reason, but is some cunningly-devised fable, in
   vented by one or more, and obtruded by various artifices upon the
   belief of the world. Inventions in this kind were man's disease, not
   his remedy: Eccles. vii. 29, God made man upright, but they sought out
   many inventions.' As when the philosophers sat a-brood upon religion, a
   goodly chimera it was they hatched and brought forth: Rom. i. 21, 22,
   They became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
   darkened;' and professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.'
   The inventions little became the nature of God; nor were they
   profitable to man, for still the great sore of nature was unhealed,
   which is a fear of death and the righteous wrath of God, Rom. i. 32. So
   that neither man's comfort nor duty was well provided for. Surely the
   gospel is none of this sort, not an invention of men, but a revelation
   of God; and a revelation not made to us in person, but brought out of
   the bosom of God by Jesus Christ, and by him manifested to chosen
   witnesses, who might publish this mystery and secret to others. Well,
   then, since the gospel is not an invention; it is a tradition, or a
   delivery of the truth upon the testimony of one that came from God, to
   instruct the world, or reduce it to him; not an invention of man, but a
   secret brought out of the bosom of God by our Lord Jesus Christ.
   Therefore it is said, Heb. ii. 3, 4, How shall we escape if we neglect
   so great salvation, first spoken by the Lord himself, and then
   confirmed to us by them that heard him, the Lord bearing them witness?'
   &c. Christ delivered it to the apostles, and the apostles delivered it
   to others: 2 Tim. ii. 2, Those things which thou hast heard from me
   among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall
   be able to teach others also.' The apostles received the gospel from
   Christ, and the churches and ministers from the apostles, and they
   delivered it down to others until it came to us, which is the means of
   our believing the truth, and confessing the name of Christ. This
   testimony, delivered and conveyed to us by the most credible means, and
   which we have no reason to doubt of, is as binding as if we had heard
   Christ and his apostles in person; for we have their word in writing,
   though we did not hear them preach and publish it with the lively
   voice; their authority is the same, delivered either way. And that
   these are their writings appeareth by the constant tradition of the
   church, and the acknowledgment of friends and enemies, who still appeal
   to them as a public authentic record. And as they have been attested by
   the church, they have been owned by God, and blessed by him to the
   conversion and sanctifying of many souls throughout all successions of
   ages: and by this tradition Christianity hath held up the head against
   all encounters of time; and the persecutions of adverse powers have not
   suppressed it, nor the disputes of enemies silenced the profession of
   it, but from age to age it hath been received, and transmitted to
   future generations, though sometimes at a very dear rate. And this is
   binding to us, though we saw not the persons and miracles by which they
   confirmed their message, and heard not the first report. Yet the
   universal tradition having handed it to us, is a sufficient ground of
   faith, and so we believe through their word, and are concerned in
   Christ's prayers, John xvii. 20; for with them and their successors, as
   to these necessary things, Christ hath promised to be to the end of the
   world, Mat. xxviii. 20.

   Secondly, My next argument is--Because Christian religion must needs be
   a tradition, partly because matter of fact is the foundation of it, and
   it is in itself matter of faith. (1.) Because it is built upon matter
   of fact: that the Son of God came from God, to bring us to God; that is
   to say, appeared in human nature, instructed the world by his doctrine
   and example, and at length died for sinners, confirming both in life
   and death the truth of his mission, by such unquestionable miracles as
   showed him to be the Son of God and the Saviour of the world. Now, a
   testimony, tradition, or report, is necessary in matters of fact, which
   of necessity must be confined to some determinate time and place. It
   was not fit that Christ should be always working miracles, always
   dying, always rising, and ascending in every place, and in the view of
   every man; but those things were to be once done in one place of the
   world, in sight of some particular and competent witnesses. But because
   the knowledge of them concerned all the rest of the world, they were by
   them to be attested to others; matters of fact can only be proved by
   credible witnesses, and this was the great office put upon the
   apostles, Acts i. 8-22; ii. 32; iii. 15; x. 39-41. (2.) As it is matter
   of faith, or the doctrine built upon this matter of fact. We cannot
   properly be said to believe a thing but upon a report and testimony. I
   may know a thing by sense or reason, but I cannot believe it, but as it
   is affirmed or brought to me by credible testimony. As we are said to
   see those things which we perceive by the eye, or the sense of seeing,
   and to know those things which we receive by reason, or sure
   demonstration; so we are said to believe those things which are brought
   to us by valuable testimony, tradition, and report. As, for instance,
   if any one ask you, Do you believe the sun shineth at noonday? You will
   answer, I do not believe it, but see it. So if any one ask you, Do you
   believe that twice two make four, and twice three make six? You will
   say, I do not believe it, but know it, because certain and evident
   reason telleth me that two is the half of four, and three of six; and
   every whole consisteth of two halves or moieties. But if he should ask
   you, Do you believe that the sun is bigger than the earth? You will
   say, I believe it; for though your eye doth not discover it, nor doth
   an ignorant man know any certain demonstration of it, yet, having the
   authority of learned men, who are competent judges in the case, you
   judge it a rash and foolish obstinacy not to believe it. Apply it now
   to the mysteries of godliness revealed in the gospel. They cannot be
   seen with the eye, for they are invisible; nor found out and
   comprehended by any human understanding, because they exceed the reach
   of man's reason, and depend upon the love and arbitrary will of God,
   John iii. 16; yet you believe them, because God hath revealed them to
   the prophets and apostles: and God, being truth and wisdom itself,
   cannot deceive or be deceived; and therefore you believe them with the
   certainty of divine faith, and do no more doubt of them than you do of
   those things which you see with your eyes, and know and understand by a
   sure demonstration. The sense of seeing may be deceived, and human
   reason may err, but it is impossible God should deceive or be deceived.
   It oftentimes falleth out that men do prefer the authority and report
   of a man whom they judge to be wise and good before their own sense and
   reason. As, for instance, that man who by his eye judges the sun to be
   less than the earth, yet doth not obstinately stand in his opinion when
   he hears a knowing and skilful philosopher assert the contrary. Now, If
   we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater,' 1 John
   v. 9. And this testimony of God is brought to us by his authorised
   messengers as the ground of faith: and what is that but tradition? We
   believe in God by hearing of him; and we hear by a preacher, Rom. x.
   14. Ordinary common preachers give us notice; but Christ and his
   apostles give us assurance; and by their testimony and tradition our
   faith is ultimately resolved into the veracity of God.

   2. That holding this tradition is the great means of standing fast in
   the faith of Christ and the confession of his name. For in the word of
   God delivered by Christ and his apostles, there is sure direction to
   walk by, and sure promises to build upon. For whatever they made known
   of Christ was not a fable but a certain truth; for they had the
   testimony of sense, 2 Peter i. 16, 17; 1 John i. 2-4, and so could
   plead both the authority of his command and the certainty of his
   promise, and that with uncontrollable evidence; and without this
   relation there can be neither faith nor obedience, nor sure expectation
   of happiness. For we cannot trust God for what he hath not promised,
   nor obey God in what he hath not commanded; nor in our difficulties and
   distresses expect happiness from him without his war rant and
   assurance. But by this doctrine delivered to us, we have all that
   belongeth to faith, obedience, and happiness, and beyond that the
   creature can desire no more. (1.) There can be no faith till we have a
   sure testimony of God's revelation; for faith is a believing such
   things as God hath revealed, because he hath revealed them. It is not
   faith but fancy to believe such things as God hath never revealed; nor
   is it trust and a regular confidence to think that he will certainly
   give us what he hath never promised; this were to lay us open to all
   manner of delusion; and therefore we are never upon sure and stable
   ground but by sticking to such a tradition as may justly entitle itself
   to God. (2.) Nor obedience: for obedience is a doing what God hath
   commanded, because he hath commanded it. The fundamental reason of
   obedience is the sight of God's will, 1 Thes. iv. 3, v. 18; 1 Peter ii.
   15. To do what God never commanded, or not to do it upon that account,
   but for other reasons, is not obedience; and in difficult cases the
   soul can never be held to its duty till we are persuaded that so is
   God's will concerning us. Now to know his will concerning us, we are
   often bidden to search the scripture: but never bidden to consult with
   the church, to know what unwritten traditions she hath in her keeping
   to instruct us in our duty. (3.) No certain expectation of happiness.
   We are never safe till we know by what rule Christ will judge us; that
   is, reward or punish men at the last day. Now he will judge us
   according to the gospel, Rom. ii. 16; 1 Thes. i. 8. Obey the gospel,
   and you have a perfect rule to guide you to happiness; but if you
   neglect this great salvation, or be unfaithful in the profession of it,
   this word condemneth you, and God will ratify the sentence of it.

   IV. That whilst the apostles were in being, there were two ways of
   delivering the truth, and that was by word of mouth and writing. So in
   the text: Whether by word or our epistle.' The apostles went up and
   down and preached Christ everywhere; that needeth no proof, unless you
   would have me to produce the whole book of the Acts of the Apostles.
   But they did not preach only, but write; and both by the instinct of
   the Holy Spirit, who guided their journeys, and moved them to write
   epistles. For being often absent from churches newly planted, and
   heresies arising, or some contentions, which could not be avoided among
   weak Christians, God overruled these occasions for the profit of the
   church in after ages: upon one occasion or another they saw a necessity
   to write; ana'nken e'schon: Jude ver. 3, It was needful for me to write
   unto you.' As, in the Old Testament, God himself delivered the law with
   great majesty and terror, and afterwards caused the same to be written
   in tables of stone, for the constant use of his people; and the
   prophets first uttered their prophecies, and then wrote unto them; so
   the apostles first preached evangelical doctrine, and then consigned it
   to writing for the use of all ages. And though all things delivered by
   them were not delivered in one sermon or one epistle, yet by degrees
   the canon of the New Testament was constituted and made perfect by the
   writings of the evangelists and apostles.

   V. That now, when they are long since gone to God, and we cannot
   receive from them the doctrine of life byword of mouth, we must stick
   to the scriptures or written word. (1.) Because we are taught to do so
   by Christ and his apostles. Christ always appealeth to the writings of
   the Old Testament, both against traditions, which he condemneth, Mat.
   xv. 2, and against pretended revelations: Luke xvi. 31, If they hear
   not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded to repent,
   if one should come from the dead.' And the apostles still have recourse
   to this proof: Acts xxvi. 22, Witnessing no other things than the
   prophets and Moses did say should come to pass.' And when they pleaded
   they were eye and ear witnesses, and so their testimony was valuable;
   yet they say we have bebaio'teron lo'gon, A surer word of prophecy,
   whereunto ye shall do well to take heed,' 2 Peter i. 19. Now, how can
   we do better than to imitate these great examples? (2.) Because those
   things were written for our sakes: 1 John i. 4, These things write we
   unto you, that your joy may be full.' The apostles, being to leave the
   world, did know the slipperiness of man's memory, and the danger of
   corrupting Christian doctrine, if there were not a sure authentic
   record left; therefore they wrote, and so fully, that nothing is
   wanting to complete our joy and happiness. (3.) Because the scriptures
   are perfect. The perfection of scripture is known by its end and
   intended use, which is to give us a knowledge of those things which
   concern our faith, duty, and happiness. (1st.) Our faith in Christ. If
   there be enough written for that end, we need not unwritten traditions
   to complete our rule. Now, St John telleth us he might have written
   more things: But these things are written that ye might believe in the
   Son of God, and have life through his name,' John xx. 30, 31. Certainly
   nothing is wanting to beget a faith in Christ. The object is
   sufficiently propounded; the warrant or claim is laid down in the new
   covenant, and the encouragements to believe it are clear and strong.
   What would men have more? So that here is a perfect rule, perfect in
   its kind, and for its proper use. (2dly.) For our duty; that is
   sufficiently provided for. The apostle telleth us that the grace of
   God'--take it objectively for the grace of the gospel, or subjectively
   for grace in our hearts--teacheth us;'--if you mean objective grace, it
   prescribeth, directeth; if subjective grace, it persuadeth and
   exciteth; what to do? l To live soberly, righteously, godly in the
   present world.' Titus ii. 12. There are all the branches of man's duty
   enumerated: sobriety relateth to self-government; righteously, to our
   carriage towards our neighbour; godly, to our commerce and communion
   with God. What is there wanting that belongeth either to worship, or
   justice, or personal holiness? Therefore certainly we need no other
   rule; for it layeth down whatsoever men are bound to do in all ages and
   places of the world, and in whatsoever circumstances God shall put
   them. And so it is fit to be the law of the universal King and
   Lawgiver; yea, it is so perfect, that whatever other way is set up, it
   presently dasheth against those notions that we have, or should have,
   of God, his service and worship; or it infringeth or perverteth the
   liberty and nature of man. (3dly.) For our happiness. That doctrine and
   institution which is able to make us wise unto salvation is enough for
   us; but so the holy scriptures are said to do: 2 Tim. iii. 15, And that
   from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to
   make thee wise unto salvation, through the faith which is in Christ
   Jesus.' Nay, afterwards, ver. 17, The man of God is by them made
   perfect, and thoroughly furnished to every good work.'

   If the scriptures do thoroughly direct men to know God in Christ, and
   save their own souls, why should we look any further? Now, they do not
   only furnish every private Christian with this knowledge, but the man
   of God,' who is to instruct others, he needeth look no further, but is
   furnished out of the scripture with all things necessary to discharge
   his office. Therefore here we fix and rest; we have a sufficient rule,
   and a full record of all necessary Christian doctrine.

   Use 1. The use of all is: Let us not seek another rule than the word of
   God. Papists cry up unwritten traditions to be received with equal
   respect and reverence, as we receive the holy scriptures. But you,
   brethren, stand fast, holding the apostolical tradition. You can not
   have it by word of mouth from them now; therefore you must stick to
   what is written, or else you cannot preserve yourselves from the frauds
   and impostures of Antichrist. These apostolical writings have been
   received in all ages and times of the church from the beginning; and
   all disputes among Christians have been tried by them. None were
   allowed good or sincere Christians who doubted of the truth of them.
   But because we have to do with a people that will sacrifice all to the
   honour and interest of their church, and knowing they are not able to
   stand before the light of scriptures, have, to the no little prejudice
   of the Christian cause, done all they can to weaken the authority,
   sufficiency, and perspicuity of them, that we might have no religion
   without the testimony and recommendation of their church; therefore I
   shall resume the matter and declare it afresh.

   1. Mankind lying in darkness and in the shadow of death, it was
   necessary that one way or another God should reveal his mind to them,
   that we may have what belongeth to our duty and happiness, for our
   .chief good and last end. Being altered by sin, we strangely mistake
   things, and put light for darkness and darkness for light, good for
   evil and evil for good, weighing all things in the balance of the
   flesh, which we seek to please. We confound both the names and natures
   of things, and wander in a maze of a thousand perplexities; therefore
   Godwin, pity to mankind, hath given us a sure direction in his word,
   which is a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our paths,' Ps. cxix.
   105. Mark the words of light and lamp. The use of a lamp is by night,
   and in the day we have the light of the sun: whether it be day or night
   with us, here we are taught how to carry ourselves. Mark again the
   words of path and feet. The one signifieth our way and general course,
   the other all our particular actions; so far as religion is concerned
   in them, we have directions in the word about them. Besides, man's
   condition is such, that he needeth a supernatural remedy by a Redeemer;
   which, depending upon the mere love and free grace of God, cannot be
   found out by natural light left to us; for that only can judge of
   things necessary, but not of such things as depend upon the mere
   pleasure of God; therefore a divine revelation there must be.

   2. Since it is necessary that God should some way or other reveal his
   mind to his people, it must be done by oracles, visions, dreams, or by
   extraordinary messengers, who by word of mouth might convey it to us;
   or else by writing, or by ordinary teachers, whose lips may preserve
   knowledge in the church. The former ways might suffice while God saw
   fit to reveal but a few truths, and such as do not burden the memory,
   and men were long-lived, and of great simplicity, and the church was
   confined within a small compass of ground, and not liable to so many
   miseries and changes as now in the latter ages; but when once God had
   spoken to us by his Son, those extraordinary ways ceased: Heb. i. 1, 2,
   God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners,--spake in times past
   to the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last times spoken to us
   by his Son.' As formerly God did speak polutro'pos, in divers
   manners,--that is to say, by visions, oracles, dreams; and so
   polumeros, at sundry times, by several steps and degrees, he acquainted
   the world with the truths necessary for man to know, delivering them
   out by portions, not altogether at once, till he came who had The
   Spirit without measure,' John iii. 34. The prophets to whom God
   revealed himself before by visions, oracles, dreams, or the coming of
   the Spirit upon them, had the spirit ek me'trou, by measure, to fit
   them for some particular errand or message on which God sent them. But
   when God sent his Son out of his bosom to reveal the whole doctrine of
   faith at once, and to declare his Father's will with full authority and
   power, he fixed and closed up the rule of faith. So it was not fit that
   after him there should come any extraordinary nuncios and ambassadors
   from heaven, or any other should be owned as infallible messengers, but
   such as he immediately sent abroad in the world to disciple the
   nations. Therefore all former extraordinary ways ceased, and we are
   left to the ordinary rule stated by Christ.

   3. Being left to the ordinary rule, it was necessary it should be
   taught, not only by word of mouth, but committed to writing; for Christ
   is ascended into heaven, and the apostles do not live for ever; and we
   have no men now that are immediately and divinely inspired; and
   ordinary pastors and teachers cannot make more articles of faith, but
   do only build on the apostles' foundation, 1 Cor. iii. 10, or that
   divinely-inspired doctrine which they delivered to the church. Yea,
   that doctrine cannot well be preserved from oblivion and corruption
   without writing. Therefore God accounted this the safest way: those
   things that are only delivered by word of mouth, or from hand to hand,
   may easily be changed, corrupted, or utterly lost. Certainly, if you
   consider man's sloth, treachery, levity, and the many vile affections
   which may easily induce him to extinguish or corrupt the truth, which
   is contrary to them, you will see that it is necessary there should be
   an authentic record by which truth and error might be tried and
   distinguished; yea, that the church, which is dispersed throughout the
   world, might have truth at hand, and particular believers have this
   doctrine ever by them for their comfort and use, it being the property
   of a blessed man to delight in the law of God,' and to exercise himself
   therein day and night,' Ps. i. 2. In short, while the apostles were
   living, it was good to take the tradition from their mouth, but, now
   they are dead, we take it from their writings. Surely if God saw some
   writing necessary when those extraordinary ways we spake of before were
   in use, and the church of the Old Testament was in a much quieter
   estate than the church of the New, I say, if some writing were
   necessary then, it is more necessary now, for the Christian church is
   more exposed to dreadful storms of persecution, the deceits of here
   tics of all sorts, especially to the frauds of Antichrist, which we are
   forewarned of in this chapter, and are detected and discovered by their
   contrariety to the written word.

   4. This truth being written, it is both a safe and a full rule for us
   to walk by. It is a safe rule, because it is written by the apostles
   and evangelists, holy men moved by the Holy Ghost. The apostles did not
   lose their infallibility when they committed what they preached to
   writing. The same Spirit that assisted them in delivering the doctrine
   by word of mouth, assisted them also when they delivered it by writing.
   And it is a full and sufficient rule, because it containeth all things
   which are necessary for men to believe and do in order to eternal life.
   Let them name what is necessary, beyond what is recommended there or
   may be delivered from thence. Yea, it doth contain not only all the
   essential, but also the integral parts of the Christian religion; and
   therefore nothing can be any part of our religion which is not there.
   The direction of old was, Isa, viii. 20, To the law and to the
   testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because
   there is no light in them.' Everything was then tried by Moses and the
   prophets; everything must be now tried by the prophets and apostles,
   which is our foundation of faith, worship, and obedience, Eph. ii. 20.

   5. That which we blame in the papists is, that they cry up a private,
   unproved, unwritten tradition of their own, as of equal authority with
   this safe and full rule which is contained in this written word of God.
   Their crime and fault may be considered partly with respect to the
   object and matter--that these traditions are not indifferent customs,
   but essential points necessary to faith and Christian practice. And so,
   though a Christian be never so thorough and sound in his obedience to
   the word of God, and true to the baptismal covenant, yet, if he
   submitteth not to these unwritten traditions, he wants some point
   necessary to faith and practice, and so to life eternal, which is
   contrary to Mark xvi. 16, He that believeth and is baptized shall be
   saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned;' and John xvii. 3,
   This is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus
   Christ, whom thou hast sent.' Partly as to the subject, as they make
   their own faction to be the only keepers of these things, and that
   nothing is to be owned as apostolical tradition but what is delivered
   as such by their authority; which is to leave the church to the tyranny
   and usurpation of a corrupt faction, to declare for apostolical
   tradition anything which serveth their end and interest, and for which
   no true historical evidence is produced. Now the unjust and fraudulent
   practices which they have used to promote this usurpation over the
   churches of Christ render them false men, most unfit to be trusted in
   this kind. Partly with respect to the manner: they will have these
   things to be received pari reverentia et pietatis affectu--with the
   same reverence and pious affection with which we receive the holy
   scriptures; and so man's post is set by God's, and unproved traditions
   equalled with doctrines of faith. Their opinion is bad enough, but
   their practice is worse; for there they show they value these things
   more than the scriptures; as superstition always aboundeth in its own
   things. Did ever any of their doctors say the same things of traditions
   which they take the boldness to say of scripture? Did they ever call
   them pen and inkhorn, or parchment divinity, a nose of wax, a dumb
   rule, an obscure and ambiguous doctrine? These blasphemies they vent
   boldly against the scriptures; but did they ever speak these of
   traditions? And again, their common people are a thousand times better
   instructed in their traditions than in the doctrine of salvation. They
   skill more of Lent and Ember-weeks, &c., than they truly understand the
   doctrine of man's misery and remedy. And call you this reverence and
   pious affection to the scriptures and traditions? Partly because they
   would never give us a catalogue of unwritten traditions necessary to be
   observed by all Christians. It may be lest they should amaze the people
   with the multitude of them, or else that the people may not know how
   many of their doctrines are destitute of scripture proof, and so they
   plainly be discovered to be imposers on the belief of the Christian
   world.

   6. Though we blame this in papists, yet we reject not all traditions:--

   [1.] Because scripture itself is a tradition, as we proved before, and!
   is conveyed to us by the most credible means, which we have no reason
   to doubt of. The scriptures of the Old Testament were preserved by the
   Jews, to whom were committed the oracles of God.' Rom. iii. 2,
   Protestants received all the books which they admitted into their
   canon. And for the books of the New Testament, the Christian church
   hath received them as the writings of those whose names they bear. And
   by the constant universal tradition of the church they are transmitted
   to us; and we have no more reason to doubt of them than we do of
   statutes and laws made by kings and parliaments who lived long before
   we had a being. Yea; we may be much more confident, as the matter is of
   greater weight and consequence, and these writings have the signature
   and stamp of God's Spirit on them, and have been blessed by God to the
   converting and sanctifying of many souls; and have been delivered down
   to us by a succession of believers unto this very day. And by them
   Christianity hath been preserved in the world, notwithstanding the
   wickedness of it, and hath held up head against all the encounters of
   time. The persecutions of adverse powers have not suppressed it, nor
   the disputes of enemies silenced the profession of it; but still from
   age to age God's truth is received and transmitted to posterity.

   [2.] Because the truth of Christianity depending upon matter of fact,
   chiefly Christ's rising from the dead, it can only be proved by a
   testimony which, in so extraordinary a case, must be made valuable, and
   authorised to the world by the miracles accompanying it. Now the notice
   of these things is brought to us by tradition, which, being
   unquestionable, giveth us as good ground of faith as it did to them
   that lived in the apostles' time, and heard their doctrine and saw
   their miracles. God's wonderful works were never intended for the
   benefit of that age only in which they were done, but for the benefit
   also of those that should hear of them by any credible means what
   soever, Ps. cxlv. 4; Joel i. 3; Ps. lxxviii. 3-7: these things were
   told them that they might set their hope in God,' &c.

   [3.] Because there are some doctrines drawn by just consequence from
   scripture, but are the more confirmed to us when they are backed with
   constant church usage and practice; as baptism of infants, Lord's-day,
   singing of psalms in our public worship, &c.

   [4.] Because there are certain words which are not found in scripture
   indeed, yet agreeable thereto, and are very useful to discover the
   frauds of heretics; as Trinity, divine providence, consubstantial,
   procession of the Holy Ghost, satisfaction, &c.

   [5.] We reject not all church history, or the records of ancient
   writers concerning the providences of God in their days in owning the
   gospel, which make much for our instruction in manners, and help to
   encourage us to put our trust in God.

   [6.] There are certain usages and innocent customs or circum stances,
   common to sacred and other actions, which we despise not, but
   acknowledge and receive as far as their own variable nature and
   condition requireth; not rejecting them, because anciently practised;
   nor regarding them, when the general law of edification requireth the
   omission of them. But that which we detest is, that the traditions of
   men should be made equal in dignity and authority with the express
   revelation of God; yea, that manifest corruptions and usurpations,--as
   making Rome the mistress of other churches, and superinducing the Pope
   as the head of the universal visible church, and the vicar of Christ,
   without his leave and appointment, and such like other points, should
   be obtruded upon the world as apostolical traditions, and to be
   received with like religious reverence as we do articles of faith set
   down in scripture. This is that we cannot sufficiently abhor, as
   apparently false, and destructive to Christianity.

SERMON XIV.

   Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath
   loved us, and given us everlasting consolation, and good hope, through
   grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
   work.--2 Thes. II. 16, 17.

   THE apostle--1. Giveth thanks for their election and vocation, vers.
   13, 14.

   2. Exhorteth them to stick fast to the truths delivered by epistles, or
   word of mouth, ver. 15.

   3. Prayeth for them, in the words now read. So that is the third means
   of confirming their faith in the truth of the gospel; prayer to God for
   them. Now in a prayer all things are plain; we must put off our shoes
   when we draw nigh to God, appear before the Lord with naked and bare
   feet. Therefore here nothing of difficulty will occur; our prayers, the
   more simply and plainly they are expressed, the more sincere they are.

   In this prayer observe:--

   I. The persons to whom this prayer is addressed: now our Lord Jesus
   Christ himself, and God, even our Father.

   II. The grounds of audience and success are intimated, which are
   two:--(1.) God's love: which hath loved us. (2.) The pledges of his
   love; which are also two:--First, Without us; Secondly, Within us.

   1. He hath given us everlasting consolation.

   2. Good hope through grace.

   III. The blessings prayed for.

   1. Increase of comfort: comfort your hearts.

   2. Perseverance or establishment: and stablish you in every good word
   and work; where, by every good word' is meant the sound doctrine of the
   gospel; by every good work,' holiness of life.

   So that here is a great harvest of matter, but we must gather it in by
   degrees, for all cannot be spoken of at once.

   First, We begin with the persons to whom the prayer is addressed: Now
   our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father;' that is, I
   beseech the Lord our Saviour, and God our Father, to comfort and
   stablish you. The observations for this branch shall be brief and
   short, because the proper seat of them lieth elsewhere.

   I. That exhortations prevail little without prayer. He had exhorted
   them to hold fast the traditions, and presently addeth, Our Lord Jesus
   Christ and God the Father stablish you in every good word and work.' It
   is good to observe how all the parts of the apostle's discourse cohere
   and agree together. He first blesseth God for their election, and then
   showeth how it is accomplished by vocation or effectual calling. Yet
   the effectually called need quickening and exhortation, that we may
   concur to our salvation in that way which is proper to us. But lest the
   business should seem wholly to rest upon our will, he carrieth up the
   matter to God again by prayer. Election doth not exclude God's means,
   which is vocation, nor man's means, which is exhortation; but that
   availeth little unless the matter be brought before God again by
   prayer.

   Now this method is necessary:--

   1. Because all from first to last come from God; he is Alpha and Omega,
   first and last; all things are from him, through him, and to him. The
   business began with God in his election, and is still carried on
   through God, not only by effectual calling, but actual assistance,
   which giveth success and blessing; and then the glory of all redoundeth
   to him.

   2. Because what cometh from God must be sought of God: Ezek. xxxvi. 37,
   I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for
   them;' compared with the 26th verse, A new heart will I give you, and a
   new spirit will I put within you.' We must express our desires to God
   for things agreeable to his will, for God will not force spiritual
   blessings upon us, nor give them to us, unless we desire them. Some
   things he gave us unasked, and without our desire, consent, or
   knowledge, as a Mediator, a new covenant, or offers of grace, yea, the
   first gift of the Spirit; but in other things we are obliged to ask.

   3. A great part of man's duty dependeth on prayer seriously performed.
   There is nothing so conducible to the maintaining of communion between
   us and God as a daily sense of our emptiness, and God's both fulness
   and readiness to supply all our wants.

   [1.] That it is so, that we are empty, and God is all-sufficient,
   otherwise there would not be a foundation for practical godliness. That
   we are empty: John xv. 5, Without me ye can do nothing.' Not only nihil
   magnum, but nihil. So 2 Cor. iii. 5, Not that we are sufficient of
   ourselves, to think anything as of ourselves, for our sufficiency is of
   God;' that is, we are not able to think anything in order to the
   conversion of other men or ourselves; we cannot imagine to enter upon
   this design with any hope of success without God. That there is a
   fulness in God to supply all our wants: Eph. iii. 20, Now unto him that
   is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we can ask or think;'
   that is, above what we can imagine and pray for. If any man seriously
   address himself to any serious business, he is full of
   imaginations--may it be effected, yea, or no? Alas! God outworketh
   their thoughts and prayers, and doth things which never entered into
   our hearts to conceive. That there is a readiness in God to supply all
   our wants, otherwise our prayers would be little encouraged, and be
   dead in the mouth. Now James i. 5, If any man lack wisdom, let him ask
   it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.' You
   need not make scruple, or be ashamed to consult with God upon every
   occasion, for he is ready, and hath not a confined bounty like ours,
   who waste by giving, and give from ourselves what we impart to others.

   [2.] That without this, communion with God would be interrupted, and
   all religion would die and languish; for if we had the stock in our
   hands, we would forget and forsake our Father. But when still we must
   be enabled by God to every good work, and we cannot have it unless we
   acknowledge him, and seek it of him by prayer, this keepeth up a
   sensible dependence of the creature upon God; this dependence begets
   observance, Phil. ii. 12; and they that continually receive their dole
   and portion from him are obliged to please him in all things.

   Use of direction. When you come to wait on the word, or receive here
   any quickening exhortation, call God into the business, that the thing
   may not die away in your hearts. Make conscience of praying as well as
   hearing. You hear from man in God's name, but carry it again to God,
   that he may bless it. All religion is carried on between the pulpit and
   the throne of grace. You will thrive if you conscientiously make use of
   both ordinances--if you hear of Christ in the word, and make use of him
   in prayer.

   II. Observation. That prayer must be made to God alone: Ps. lxv. 2,
   thou that nearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.' The apostle
   here addresseth himself to God, and so must all flesh.

   1. He alone is capable of hearing prayers. We conceive of God as an
   infinite being, wise, powerful, and good; as knowing all things, as
   able to do all things, as willing to give all things that we can in
   reason and righteousness ask of him.

   [1.] He knoweth all things, our persons, wants, necessities, prayers.
   Our persons: God knoweth that there is such a creature in the world as
   thou art; for surely God knoweth whom he hath made, and whom he
   supporteth and governeth. A notable instance we have: Acts ix. 11, And
   the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street that is called
   Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of
   Tarsus; for behold he prayeth.' What a description is here of God's
   particular providence!--the city of Damascus; the street called
   Straight; the house of one Judas; the person (a lodger there), one Saul
   of Tarsus; the action he was employed in, behold, he prayeth! He
   knoweth our wants and necessities: Mat. vi. 8, Your Father knoweth what
   things ye have need of before you ask him.' He observed every weary
   step of David in the wilderness, and all his tears and sorrows: Ps.
   lvi. 8, Thou tellest my wanderings; put thou my tears in thy bottle:
   are they not in thy book?' He particularly took notice of all the
   troubles and sorrows of his exile and wandering condition, as if his
   tears had been preserved in a bottle, and his troubles registered or
   recorded in a book. The doctrine of the Gentiles was, Dii magna curant,
   parva negligunt--that great and weighty matters the Lord took into his
   care, but left other things to their own event and chance; but the
   doctrine of the scripture is otherwise; God taketh notice of every
   particular person. For our prayers: Ps. xxxiv. 6, This poor man cried
   unto the Lord, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his
   troubles.' How obscure soever the worshipper be in the account of the
   world, if he depend on God, the Lord will regard him.

   [2.] For his power. He is able to do all things: Mark xiv. 36, Abba,
   Father, all things are possible to thee.'

   [3.] For his goodness. He relieveth all his creatures; heareth the
   moans of the beasts, much more the prayers of the saints: Ps. cxlv. 15,
   16, The eyes of all things wait upon the Lord, and thou givest them
   their meat in due season,' c. Now this he makes a ground of fulfilling
   the desires of them that fear him, and being near to all that call upon
   him,' vers. 18, 19. He that feedeth a kite, will he not provide for a
   child? Surely we have more reason to trust in God than they, if you
   think this belongeth to his common bounty. But in spiritual things it
   is otherwise; he is most pleased when we ask spiritual blessings: 1
   Kings iii. 10, It pleased the Lord that Solomon asked this thing.'
   Well, then, since none other is capable, and God is, to him must we
   come.

   2. The scriptures, which are the proper rule of worship, direct us to
   no other. When Christ taught his disciples to pray, he directed them to
   God: Luke xi. 2, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven.'
   Invocation is divine worship, and so done to God alone.

   3. When the Spirit moveth us to pray, he inclineth us to come to God:
   Rom. viii. 15, Ye have received the Spirit of adoption, where by we
   cry, Abba, Father;' Gal. iv. 5, 6, Because ye are sons, he hath sent
   forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.' He
   doth not move us to go to the saints, but to God.

   The use. Well, then, if any trouble befall us, let us call on God,
   unbosom ourselves to him: Ps. l. 15, Call upon me in the day of
   trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.' If we want
   any grace, let us go to the God of all grace, in the name of Christ:
   Heb. iv. 16, Seeing, therefore, we have a great high priest that is
   entered into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us come boldly to the
   throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help us in
   a time of need.' We can pray to none but to him in whom we trust: Ps.
   lxii. 8, Trust in the Lord at all times; pour out your hearts before
   him.' Trust is the foundation of prayer. They that look to God for all
   will frequently apply themselves to him. Our necessities and wants are
   continual, both as to the temporal and spiritual things. We need not
   only daily bread, but daily pardon, daily strength against temptations;
   therefore let us often come to God.

   III. Observation. That Jesus Christ is invoked together with the Father
   as an author of grace, and thereby his Godhead is proved; for he that
   is an object both of internal and external worship is God. Now such is
   Christ. Of internal worship: John xiv. 1, Ye believe in God, believe
   also in me.' Though Christ died as man, yet he is God equal with the
   Father, and an object of faith and trust. For external worship, or
   prayer, the text is clear: Our Lord Jesus Christ, and God, even our
   Father.' That is much for the comfort of the faithful, that we have God
   to trust in, and Christ to trust in; that we that have sinned with both
   hands earnestly, have a double ground of our comfort and hope--the
   infinite mercy and power of God, and the infinite merit of a mediator.
   There is a great latitude in the object of faith, and so of invocation:
   The Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father.' There is no pain so
   great that God in Christ cannot remove; no danger so dreadful but he
   can prevent; no misery so deep but he can deliver from it; no enemy so
   strong, but he can vanquish them; no want that he cannot supply. When
   we have a want that he cannot supply, or a sickness that he cannot
   cure, or a danger that he cannot prevent, or a misery that he cannot
   remove, or enemies that are too hard for him, then we may sit down and
   despair, and die. I speak of both as one, for God and Christ are here
   joined as to the same effect: Comforting their hearts, and stablishing
   them in every good word and work.'

   IV. Observation. We can obtain nothing from God unless we seek it in
   Jesus Christ. Therefore the apostle beginneth his prayer, Now our Lord
   Christ, and God,' &c. God alone is abundantly enough for our happiness,
   for there is in him more than abundantly enough to satisfy all the
   capacities of the creature; but without a mediator how shall we come to
   receive of his fulness? If man had kept innocent, God had been enough
   to us, for in innocency there was no mediator; but to man fallen a
   mediator is necessary

   1. I shall state the necessity of it. Because of distance and
   difference; we are unworthy to approach his holy presence; and God hath
   a quarrel and controversy with us, which till it be taken up, we can
   expect no good thing from him.

   [1.] Distance. We are estranged from God by the fall, and have lost his
   image, lost his favour and fellowship, and all communion with him, so
   that God now is looked upon by us as out of the reach of our commerce,
   which hindereth our love and confidence in him; for we can hardly
   depend upon one so far above us that he will take notice of us, or take
   care for us, so as to relieve us in our necessities, or help us in our
   miseries, and give us the blessings we ask of him; or that we shall be
   welcome to him, when we come with our prayers and supplications. God
   taught the Israelites their distance; and the apostle telleth us that
   all that dispensation the Holy Ghost did signify, that the way into the
   holiest was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was
   standing.' Heb. ix. 8. They could not come near God without danger of
   death; he would not have them so familiar with him.

   [2.] Difference, or controversy. A mediator is used only between
   disagreeing parties. When man was guilty, God was angry. Conscience of
   sin presents God terrible, and taketh away all confidence from us, so
   that we are obnoxious to his wrath and righteous vengeance: 1 Sam. vi.
   20, Who is able to stand before this Holy God?' Isa. xxxiii. 14, And
   who can dwell with everlasting burnings?' We cannot approach God in any
   friendly manner.

   2. I shall show what provision God hath made for us. The Lord Jesus
   took this office at God's appointment, of reconciling God to us, and
   appeasing his wrath, and us to God, by bringing us back again, our
   alienated and estranged affections to God. How so? what hath he done?

   [1.] The distance is in truth taken away by his very person. He is
   God-man; God and man meet together in the person of Christ. God doth
   condescend and come down to man, and man is encouraged to ascend to
   God. God in Christ is nearer to man than he was before, that we may
   have more familiar thoughts of him. The pure Deity is at so vast a
   distance from us, that we are amazed and confounded when we think of
   it, and cannot conceive an hope that he should concern himself in our
   affairs. But the Son of God is come in our nature: John i. 14, The word
   was made flesh, and dwelt among us;' 1 Tim. iii. 16, Great is the
   mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh;' so that he is more
   accessible to us, and nearer at hand, and more readily inclined to help
   us, for he will not be strange to his own flesh.

   [2.] The difference and controversy is taken up by the work of his
   redemption; for God hath set him forth to be a propitiation,' or a
   means of appeasing his wrath, Rom. iii. 25, and to be the foundation of
   that new covenant wherein pardon and life is offered to us. It is not
   enough to our recovery that God be reconciled, but man must be renewed,
   otherwise we remain for ever under the displeasure of God. Now he hath
   purchased the grace of the Spirit, to be dispensed by the covenant, to
   bring us home to God: Titus iii. 5, 6, Not by works of righteousness
   which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the
   washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed
   on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;' and Rom. viii. 2,
   For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
   from the law of sin and death.'

   Use. Let us be sensible of this unspeakable mercy, that God hath
   provided a Mediator for us, that we may come to God by him: Heb. vii,
   25, Wherefore he is able to save unto the uttermost all that come unto
   God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for us;'
   that the legal exclusion is removed, and a way opened to the Father:
   John xiv. 6, I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh to
   the Father but by me;' otherwise we could not immediately converse with
   God, nor trust in him.

   1. We see God in our nature as near at hand, and ready to help us; he
   came down amongst us, and became one of us; was bone of our bone, and
   flesh of our flesh.' And though he hath removed his dwelling into
   heaven again, it is for our sakes; he hath carried our nature thither,
   to take possession of that blessed place in our name, if we have a mind
   to follow him: John xiv. 2, I go to prepare a place for you.'

   2. Here we see the means of appeasing God's wrath: 2 Cor. v. 19, God
   was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.' There is a full
   ransom paid; all that enter into God's peace shall have the benefit of
   it.

   3. By him we are encouraged to come to pray for every blessing we stand
   in need of: Eph. ii. 18, Through him we both have an access by one
   Spirit unto the Father.' Liberty to approach unto God is a privilege
   which we cannot enough value; the wall of partition between God and us
   is broken down by Christ; he hath completely satisfied God's justice,
   Heb. x. 19. He is now at the right hand of God interceding for us: 1
   Tim. ii. 5, There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the
   man Christ Jesus;' and remaineth with God as the great agent of the
   saints: Heb. viii. 1, 2, We have such an high priest, who is set on the
   right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens, a minister of
   the sanctuary,' &c. Perfuming their prayers with the smoke of his
   incense: Rev. viii. 3, 4, And another angel came and stood at the
   altar, having a golden censer, and there was given unto him much
   incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon
   the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the
   incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before
   God out of the angel's hand.'

   V. Observation. Mark the distinct titles given to God and the Mediator:
   Christ is called our Lord, and God our Father. Let us see what these
   titles import, of Lord and Father.

   1. Christ is represented to us as the Lord; so he was set forth by the
   apostles at the first preaching of the gospel: Acts x. 36, We preach
   peace by Christ Jesus, he is Lord of all;' 2 Cor. iv. 5, We preach
   Christ Jesus the Lord;' Col. ii. 6, If ye have received Christ Jesus
   the Lord, so walk in him.' Christ is Lord two ways:--

   [1.] By that right which belongeth to him as Creator, and is common and
   equal to him with the Father and the Spirit. Surely the Creator of the
   world is the sovereign of it. This right continueth still, and shall
   continue while man receiveth his being from God by creation, and the
   continuance of his being by daily preservation and providence.

   [2.] There is novum jus dominii et imperii--a new right of empire and
   government which belongeth to him as Redeemer, and this accrueth to
   him:--

   (1.) Partly by the donation of God: Acts ii. 36, Let all the house of
   Israel know that this Jesus, whom ye have crucified, is made Lord and
   Christ.' This office of Lord is derivative, and cannot be supreme, but
   subordinate; it is derived from God: All power is given to me, both in
   heaven and earth,' Mat. xxviii. 18; and it is referred to him: Phil.
   ii. 11, That every tongue should confess that Christ is Lord, to the
   glory of God the Father.' The supreme right of governing is still in
   God, and subjection to him is not vacated, but established and
   reserved.

   (2.) It is acquired by his own purchase: Rom. xiv. 9, For this end
   Christ both died and rose again, and revived, that he might be Lord
   both of dead and living;' 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20, Ye are not your own, for
   ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in
   your spirit, which are God's.' He had a full right in us before, but
   this lordship and dominion which the Redeemer is possessed of is
   comfortable and beneficial to us, and the end of it is to effect man's
   cure and recovery. We could not by our sin make void God's right and
   title to govern us; but yet it was not comfortable to us, it was but
   such a right as a prince hath to chastise his rebellious subjects. We
   forfeited our interest in his gracious protection, therefore was this
   new interest set afoot to save and recover fallen man; therefore this
   lordship is spoken of as medicinal and restorative, to reduce man to
   the obedience of God that made him: Acts x. 38, God anointed Jesus of
   Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and with power, who went about doing
   good, and healing all that were oppressed with the devil.' It is a
   lordship that conduceth to make peace between God and man, that we may
   again enjoy his favour, and live in his obedience: Acts v. 31, Him hath
   God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a Saviour, for to
   give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins.' This new Lord hath
   made a new law of grace, which is lex remedians, a remedy propounded
   for the recovering the lapsed world of mankind. The great benefit is
   remission of sins; the great duty, repentance.

   Use 1. To persuade us to submit ourselves to this blessed Lord by our
   voluntary consent: Ps. xlv. 11, He is thy Lord; worship thou him.'
   There is a passive subjection and a voluntary submission. By a passive
   subjection all creatures are under the power of the Son of God and our
   Redeemer; and amongst the rest, the devils themselves, though grievous
   revolters and rebels, are not exempted; every knee is forced to bow to
   Christ. By voluntary submission: Those are Christ's subjects, and
   admitted into his kingdom, who willingly give up them selves to the
   Redeemer to be saved upon his own terms: 2 Cor. viii. 5, They first
   gave their own selves to the Lord.' The devils and wicked men are his
   against their wills; but all Christ's people are his by their own
   consent.

   Use 2. Let us perform the duties which this title calleth for; our
   obedience is the best testimony of our subjection to him. Many seem to
   like Christ as a Saviour, but refuse him as a Lord; whereas Christ is
   not only a Saviour to bless, but a Lord to rule and command. Therefore
   if we catch at comforts and neglect duty, we do not own Christ's
   authority. The libertine, yokeless spirit is very natural to all: Luke
   xix. 14, We will not have this man to reign over us;' Ps. xii. 4, With
   our tongues we will prevail; our lips are our own; who is Lord over
   us?' Ps. ii. 3, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their
   cords from us.' Some are so in opinion, but most in practice. We would
   not be under command; we love privileges, but decline duties. But he is
   the head of the church' who is the Saviour of the body,' Eph. v. 23. If
   we would have privileges by him, we must set ourselves to obey his
   laws. If thou hast no care to obey him as a lord, thy esteem of Christ
   is but imaginary, thy knowledge but partial, thy application of him
   unsound. But we will own him as lord. How is that understood? Will you
   give him an empty title, or some superficial compliments and
   observances? Luke vi. 46, And why call you me Lord, Lord, and do not
   the things that I say?' It is a mockage. Or will you please yourselves
   with strict opinions? Mat. vi. 21, 22, For where your treasure is,
   there will your heart be also. The light of the body is the eye; if
   therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light;
   if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
   darkness!' No; nothing less than a thorough subjection to his holy
   laws, forsaking all other lords: Isa. xxvi. 13, Lord our God, other
   lords besides thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we
   make mention of thy name.' And then a strict observance: Col. i. 11,
   Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all
   patience and long-suffering, with joyfulness.'

   Use 3. Depend upon Christ for the effects of his love to you, which are
   the privileges of his kingdom, which are pardon of sins: Col. i. 14, In
   whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our
   sins.' The sanctification of the Spirit; Heb. viii. 10, This is the
   covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,
   saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in
   their hearts.' Assistance in carrying on the spiritual life; that here
   surely our Lord will not desert us, but help us in our obedience to
   him. Finally, everlasting life: Heb. v. 9, And being made perfect, he
   became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.'
   When the devil and his instruments are cast into hell, Christ's
   faithful subjects and servants are advanced into eternal glory and
   blessedness.

   Secondly, God is represented under the title of a father: And God, even
   our Father.' God is a word of power; Father expresseth his good will
   and love. God standeth in both relations to us, as he did also to
   Christ: John xx. 17, I go to my God and your God, my Father and your
   Father.' Both joined together signify his power and readiness to do
   good. He that is our Father is true God also, and he that is true God
   is also our Father; and therefore we may depend on him. That which we
   are to open is the term Father, which speaketh both comfort and duty to
   us.

   1. Comfort. For God's dealing with us will be very fatherly; as a
   father loveth his children, so will God love his people: 2 Cor. vi. 18,
   I will be a father to you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith
   the Lord.'

   [1.] He will pardon our sins and frailties, and spare us and pity us,
   notwithstanding our ill-deservings: Ps. ciii. 13, Like as a father
   pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him;' Mal.
   iii. 17, They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when
   I make up my jewels, and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son
   that serveth him.' Surely this is a grace we stand in need of, because
   of our manifold infirmities and daily failings.

   [2.] He will give grace, that we may serve him better: Luke xi. 13, If
   ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
   much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that
   ask him?' Do but cry to him, as an hungry child to his father for
   bread, and God will not deny this great gift to you.

   [3.] God will provide for us, and give such an allowance of temporal
   mercies as are convenient: Mat. vi. 25, Take no thought for your life,
   what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body, what
   ye shall put on;' and ver. 32, For after all these things do the
   Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of
   all these things.' The belief of adoption and particular providence
   kills all distrustful fears and cares at the very root.

   [4.] He will protect you and preserve you against temptations: 1 Peter
   i. 3, 5, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which,
   according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively
   hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, &c., who are
   kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.'

   [5.] He will give you the kingdom: Luke xii. 32, Fear not, little
   flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.'

   2. On the other side, this relation bespeaketh duty. For if God be a
   father, we must carry ourselves as children by our subjection, to him;
   that is, by submission to his disposing will, and obedience to his
   governing will.

   [1.] By an absolute submission to his disposing will. For if you would
   enjoy the privileges of God's family, you must submit to the discipline
   of his family: Heb. xii. 6-9, For whom God loveth he chasteneth, and
   scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If you endure chastening, God
   dealeth with you as with sons: for what son is he whom the father
   chasteneth not? But if you are without chastisement, whereof all are
   partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. Furthermore, we have had
   fathers of our flesh, which chastened us, and we gave them reverence;
   shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and
   live?' In heaven, where there is no danger of sin, there is no use of
   the rod; but while we are in the flesh, we need correction, and if God
   should not give it us. we are no'thoi, not legitimate, but degenerate
   sons. But in the 10th verse, the apostle argueth from God's paternal
   authority: For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
   pleasure, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his
   holiness.' Children, though they take it ill to be beaten by others,
   yet not by their parents, who (under God) are the cause of their being,
   and love them, and in correction of them seek their good; much more do
   we owe this respect to our heavenly Father, who hath a more absolute
   right over us. Parents may err through want of wisdom--their
   chastisements may be arbitrary and irregular; do much in passion rather
   than compassion; but all God's chastisements come from purest love, and
   are regulated by perfect wisdom, and tend to and end in holiness and
   happiness.

   [2.] Obedience to his governing will. The great duty of children is to
   love, please, obey, and honour their father: Mal. i. 6, A son honoureth
   his father, and a servant his master. If I be a father, where is mine
   honour? If I be a master, where is my fear?' 1 Peter i. 14, 15, As
   obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former
   lusts in your ignorance. But as he which hath called you is holy, so be
   ye holy in all manner of conversation;' John xv. 8, Herein is my Father
   glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.' There
   should be a great tenderness upon us not to do anything that may be a
   breach of God's law, or tend to God's dishonour. What diligent
   observers were the Rechabites of the institutions of their family: Jer.
   xxxv. 6, But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
   Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither
   ye, nor your sons for ever.'

   VI. Observation. They to whom Christ is a lord, to them God is a
   father. His special fatherly love floweth in the channel of redemption,
   and is brought about by the gospel. The Lord, from all eternity,
   predeterminated some to the adoption of sons: Eph. i. 5, Having
   predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
   himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.' But how doth he
   bring to pass this decree? By the redemption of Christ. It is no mean
   privilege, Christians, that needeth so much ado to establish it: Gal.
   iv. 4, 5, But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
   Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were
   under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.' Christ came
   to be the foundation of a new covenant, before we could have this
   privilege. Well, but whence ariseth our actual interest? I answer--By
   accepting the offer of the gospel, or receiving and owning Christ to
   the ends for which he came into the world, or God sent him into the
   world: John i. 12, But as many as received him, to them gave he power
   to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name;' that
   is, by depending on his merits for our reconciliation with God, and
   submitting to his laws, that he might reduce us to our primitive
   obedience and love to them.

   Use. Therefore, if you would have a share in this blessed privilege:--

   1. You must be regenerated by his Spirit; for the relative change
   dependeth on the real: our state is not changed till our natures be
   changed: John i. 12, 13, Being born again of the will of God.' If you
   would enter into God's family, and enjoy the privileges thereof, you
   must be changed by the Spirit.

   2. There is required on our part an entrance into the kingdom of the
   Mediator by faith and repentance: Mat. xviii. 3, Except ye be
   converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the
   kingdom of God.' As little children are newly entered into the world
   and beginning their life, all things are become new to them; so those
   that have the privileges of God's children must become as little
   children, enter into a new state, carry on a new life and trade, with
   which they were not acquainted before. Our first admission is by a
   consent to the new covenant: Gal. iii. 26, Ye are all made children of
   God by faith in Christ;' depending on the merit of Christ's sacrifice,
   and binding ourselves by a solemn word to perform the duties required
   of us, which we renew again in the Lord's Supper.

   VII. That we most comfortably come to God by Christ for grace, when we
   consider our interest in him and relation to him. Our relation is here
   intimated, for Jesus Christ is our Lord, and God is our Father; and
   surely our Lord will not refuse his own subjects, nor our Father be
   strange to his own children.

   1. It is certain that among men relation to any person or thing
   endeareth them to us. To` anton pasin e de'a philo'teknoi, [5] men love
   their own children; though not so fair and good as others, yet they are
   their own. And is it not so as to God? See John xiii. 1, Having loved
   his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end;' and John
   xvii. 6, I have manifested thy name to the men which thou gavest me out
   of the world; thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have
   kept thy word.'

   2. Interest giveth us more encouragement: Isa. lxiii. 19, We are thine:
   thou never barest rule over them; they were never called by thy name;'
   that is, we are thy people, thy subjects, so called, so accounted. That
   interest giveth some hope and confidence is evident, because sometimes
   the saints plead the common relation that they are the workmanship of
   his hands: Ps. cxix. 73, Thy hands have made me and fashioned me; give
   me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.' They will not
   quit their interest in God; if they cannot come as his special
   servants, yet as his creatures, one way or another, they will entitle
   themselves to him.

   Use. To direct the servants of God, when they ask any grace of him, to
   bring it to this still, Our Lord and our Father.' But how shall they do
   so, if they have no assurance? I answer:--

   1. There are some titles which imply a claim to benefits and
   privileges; others that infer an obligation to duty: these latter may
   be used without any usurpation: John xx. 28, My Lord, and my God.'

   2. Resignation of yourselves to him showeth you are his, and in time
   you will come to know that he is yours, if you make it good: Ps. cxix.
   94, I am thine; save me, for I have sought thy precepts.' Resolve to
   obey him, and serve him, however he deal with you. Choice of God for
   our portion, and Christ for our Lord, showeth you are resolved to be
   his.

   3. Speak as the covenant speaketh that you are under, till your
   sincerity be more unquestionable. God offers himself to be our God, and
   Redeemer, and Father; Christ to be our Lord and Saviour: Isa. lxiii.
   16, Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us,
   and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O Lord, art our Father, our
   Redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.' God offered himself to be so,
   and God is angry for not owning it: Jer. iii. 4, Wilt thou not from
   this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?'

SERMON XV.

   Which hath loved us, and given us everlasting consolation, and good
   hope through grace.--2 Thes. II. 16.

   WE come now to the second branch, the ground of audience and success in
   prayer: Which hath loved us, and given us everlasting consolation, and
   good hope through grace.' Where three grounds of acceptance are
   intimated:--

   I. The first is taken from the rise and foundation of all the love of
   God: he hath loved us.

   II. From the matter of our comfort: he hath given us everlasting
   consolation.

   III. From the way whereby we receive it and entertain it: and good hope
   through grace.

   The first relateth to our redemption by Christ.

   The second to the new covenant.

   The third to the disposition of our hearts, and how we are affected in
   the reception of these things, as will appear more in the explication
   of each branch.

   First, I begin with the rise and foundation of that grace which we
   expect and beg of God in prayer: he hath loved us.'

   Doct. That God's love to sinners, manifested in our redemption by
   Christ, giveth great boldness and encouragement in prayer.

   1. I shall prove this is the love here intended.

   2. That this giveth boldness in prayer.

   I. That this is the love here intended, for these reasons:--

   1. This is a visible effect and demonstration of his love to us: 1 John
   iii. 16, Hereby perceive we the love of God to us, in that he laid down
   his life for us;' and 1 John iv. 9, 10, In this was manifested the love
   of God towards us, in that he sent his only-begotten Son into the
   world, that we might live by him. Herein was love, not that we loved
   God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for
   our sins.' From these places I gather, that to found our confidence and
   hope, it was needful that the love God had to us should show itself by
   some manifest and real proof. How can we tell how God's heart standeth
   affected to mankind but by the effects? Whatever benevolence or
   good-will he has towards us, it is not evident to us till it break
   forth into some action, and real performance of some great thing for
   us. Now this was fully manifested in giving his Son to die for a sinful
   world, that he hath a love for us, and doth really desire our
   salvation. There is a hidden love of God, which is his eternal purpose
   and decree; and there is an open and declared love, and that is first
   and most seen in our redemption by Christ. In predestination his love
   was conceived in his heart; in redemption it is manifested in the
   effects; that was the rise, this the visible demonstration and sign of
   it. Now the apostle would not reason from what was hidden and secret,
   but from what is open and manifest.

   2. This is not only, the demonstration and visible proof of the reality
   of his love, but an ample representation and commendation of the
   greatness of his love: Rom. v. 8, But God commendeth his love to us, in
   that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.' A thing may be
   demonstrated to be real that yet is not commended or set forth as great
   and glorious. But God would express his love in such an astonishing
   instance, that we might admire the greatness as well as believe the
   reality of it: John iii. 16, God so loved the world,' &c.; that is, so
   unspeakably, so inconceivably would he express his love to mankind, as
   to send his Son to assume our nature, and die for our transgressions.
   He doth not tell you how, but leaveth you to admire at it, and rejoice
   in it. What may we not expect from this love, this great love? If God
   loveth us at such a rate, surely he is in good earnest; his heart is
   set upon our salvation, or else he would never have taken this course
   of giving his only Son to suffer an accursed and shameful death. Now
   when the apostle saith God hath loved us,' he meaneth it of the great
   instance of his love. Analogum per se positum, stat pro suo significatu
   famosiori--words not restrained by the context must be interpreted in
   the most famous and known sense.

   3. This is the first motive to draw our hearts to him: 1 John iv. 19,
   We loved him, because he loved us first.' The first motive of our
   affection is not his special electing love to us above others, for that
   we cannot know before we love him; but his common love and mercy to
   sinners, and that was manifested in Christ's being sent to be a
   propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins
   of the whole world. This is that which is propounded to us to recover
   and reconcile our alienated and estranged affections to God: 2 Cor. v.
   19, 20, God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not
   imputing their trespasses unto him.' This grace God offereth to us, as
   well as others; namely, that for Christ's sake he will pardon our sins,
   if we will lay down our weapons and enter into his peace. None are
   bound to believe that God specially loveth them, but those that are
   specially beloved by him, for none are bound to believe a falsehood,
   and a false hood it is to us, till we have the saving effects and
   benefits. Therefore, it is not the special, but the general love which
   first draweth in our hearts to God; yea, the saints, after some
   testimonies received of God's special love, still make this to be the
   great engaging motive: Gal. ii. 20, I live by faith in the Son of God,
   who loved me, and gave himself for me.' Well, then, this is most likely
   to be meant by the apostle.

   II. This must needs give great boldness in prayer.

   1. By this we see that God's love is not a cold, ineffectual love, that
   consists only in raw wishes, but an operative, active love, that
   issueth forth to accomplish what he intendeth to us, though by the most
   costly means, and acted at the dearest rate. God is good, and doth
   good,' Ps. cxix. 68. He hath a love to us, and will do good to us. Our
   love many times goes no further than good wishes or good words be
   warmed, be clothed, but giveth not those things which are needful to
   the body, James ii. 16; but God resteth not in kind wishes, but giveth
   a full demonstration of it. If Christ be needful to the saints, they
   shall have him; if God spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for
   us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?'

   2. It is an act of such infinite love in God to give us Christ to die
   for us, such as may raise our wonder and astonishment. God's love is an
   immeasurable love, and so enlargeth our expectations and capacity for
   the reception of other things: Eph. iii. 18, 19, That ye may comprehend
   with all saints to know what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and
   height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that
   ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.' There is such an
   immensity in the love of Christ as raiseth our desires and hopes to
   expect all other things from God that belong to our duty and happiness.
   If God will do this, what will he not do for those whom he loveth? He
   that hath given the greatest gift will not stick at lesser things. He
   that hath given a talent, shall he not give a penny? He that hath given
   Christ, will he not give pardon to cancel our debts, grace to do our
   duty, comfort to support us in afflictions, supplies to maintain and
   protect us during our service? Finally, will he not reward us when our
   work is over? Reconciliation by his death is propounded as more
   difficult than salvation by his life: Rom. v. 10, For if, when we were
   enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more,
   being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.'

   3. It is a gift in order to other things, and therefore he will
   complete that gift. Christ came to purchase all manner of blessings for
   us: the favour of God, the fruition of God, the everlasting fruition of
   God in glory, and all things by the way necessary thereunto. There are
   two arguments implied:--

   [1.] That God may now do us good without any impeachment of his honour.
   His justice and holiness is sufficiently demonstrated, the authority of
   his law, and truth of his threatenings kept up: Rom. iii. 25, 26, Whom
   God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to
   declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,
   through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his
   righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier of him that
   believeth in Jesus.'

   [2.] That after God by an antecedent bounty hath laid the foundation so
   broad and deep, the consequent bounty, which is as the upper building
   for which this foundation was intended, will be laid on also. It was
   said of the foolish builder, that he began and was not able to finish.
   Surely the wise God, if we be qualified, and put no impediment on our
   part, will finish what he hath begun.

   4. Because the giving of Christ showeth how freely God will give all
   things to us. He gave Christ unasked, unsought too; in this instance we
   see his free and undeserved love. This was love to rebels and enemies.
   When the world had corrupted their way and cast off God, then Christ
   died for us; a consideration which serveth to support our confidence,
   notwithstanding the sense of our unworthiness. In the covenant of
   grace, great and wonderful mercies are given out to a world of sinners,
   and to ourselves among the rest. We see how loth God is sinners should
   perish; that sins may be pardoned if we will accept God's terms, that
   hath given such general testimony of his love to mankind, his love to
   miserable sinners, that is willing they should be reconciled; that
   there is not so much difference between us and others as between him
   and all. Now this encourageth us to fulfil the conditions of the
   gospel, notwithstanding our unworthiness of the privileges thereof.

   Use 1. Is caution. Let us not have wrong thoughts of God when we come
   to him. We think of God the Father as one that is all wrath and
   justice, and unwilling to be reconciled to man, or brought to it with
   much difficulty. No; Christ came on purpose to show the love and
   loveliness of God to us; for our redemption came first out of the bosom
   of God; and Christ's mission into the world, and dying for sinners, was
   the fruit of his love; and mainly for this end, to give us a full
   demonstration of the love of God, and his pity to the lost world of
   sinners, that when our guilt had made him frightful to us, we might not
   fly from him as a condemning God, but love him, and serve him, and pray
   to him, as one willing to be reconciled to us: therefore take heed what
   picture of God you draw in your minds. Light and heat are not more
   abundant in the sun than love is in God.

   Use 2. Of direction to us how to conceive of God in prayer, as one that
   loveth us. We have gained a great point when we are persuaded of this,
   and can come with this thought into his presence, that I am praying to
   a God that loveth me, and will do me good. You will say, If I could
   come to that, I have gained a great point indeed. But what hindereth?
   There is, I confess, a twofold love,--his general love, and his special
   love. His general love, which intendeth benefits to us; and his special
   love, which hath already put us in possession of them. His general love
   to the lost world; and his love and mercy to us in particular, putting
   us in possession of the saving benefits purchased and intended.

   1. The general love to the lost world, that is a great thing the devil
   seeketh to hide and obscure, the wonderful love of God revealed in our
   Redeemer, that we may still fly from God, as more willing to punish
   than to save; and many poor dark creatures gratify his design. We are
   still seeking signs and tokens of God's love, something to warrant us
   to come to God by Christ, and to persuade us that we shall be welcome
   if we do so; and because we cannot find anything in ourselves that he
   will admit us, we are troubled. But all this while we are but seeking
   the sun with a candle. What greater evidence of God's willingness to
   receive you than the death of Christ, than the institutions of the
   gospel? This is above all evidences, that he sent his Son to die for
   us. This is like the Jews, who, when they had seen many wonders wrought
   by Christ, would still have a new sign: the greatest sign is given
   already, Christ dying for a sinful world. Men and angels cannot find
   out a sign, pledge, and confirmation of the love of God above that.
   Yet, if that be not enough, we have another sign, the promises and
   invitations of the gospel, which show his willingness to welcome
   sinners. Salvation is offered, but not to named, but described persons.
   Therefore, if we are willing to come under these hopes upon God's
   terms, this may satisfy our scrupulous minds; there is no bar put to us
   but what we put to ourselves by our refusing the grace as God offereth
   it. Certainly God's love and mercy to lost mankind is our first motive,
   and his willingness to impart good things to them upon his own terms;
   and surely he is well pleased with our acceptance of them.

   2. There is special love where this grace is applied to us: Eph. ii. 4,
   5, But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved
   us, hath quickened us, when we were dead in trespasses and sins.' He
   did not begin to love us when we were converted--that is of a more
   ancient and eternal rise--but then he did begin to apply his love to
   us; and this is no ordinary, but great love, when God was angry with
   us, and pronounced wrath on us in the sentence of the law, and appeared
   as an enemy in the course of his providence, and the apprehensions of
   our guilty fears, then to be reconciled; and surely this is a great
   advantage to draw nigh to God as a reconciled Father. This is the
   object of our everlasting love and joy: Rom. v. 11, And not only so,
   but we also joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have
   now received the atonement.' And this is a prop of confidence in
   prayer. Could we once believe that he dearly loves us, and is
   reconciled to us, and taketh us for his children, that he delighteth in
   our prosperity; oh, how cheerfully could we come into his presence!
   John xvi. 27, The Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me,
   and believe that I came out from God.' They have not only his
   intercession, but the Father's especial love, which is the ground and
   hope of audience. Now this particular interest dependeth on some thing
   wrought in our souls by the Holy Spirit. Our Lord mentioneth two
   things--their faith in Christ, and love to God. (1.) Faith in Christ,
   or a thankful acceptance of him as our Lord and Saviour, therefore
   called receiving Christ, and entitling us to the privileges of Christ's
   children: John i. 12, To as many as received him, to them gave he
   liberty to become the children of God, even to as many as believe in
   his name.' (2.) Love to God: John xiv. 21, He that hath my commandments
   and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall
   be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to
   him;' and ver. 23, If any man love me, he will keep my words; and my
   Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode
   with him.' We cannot perceive our interest in the special love of God
   but by our sincerity, faith in Christ, and love to God. When we see
   God's love taken in our hearts, we may know that he loveth us,
   especially the latter; for by the latter the former is manifested also:
   Gal. v. 6, Faith worketh by love.' Now the evidences of sincere love to
   God are seeking after God and delighting in him; if you cannot find the
   latter, the former will evidence it to you: Prov. viii. 17, I love them
   that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me.' The
   desiderium unionis, the desiring, seeking love, if it be serious and
   earnest, it is sincere, though you find not such delightful
   apprehensions of his grace to you. Clear that once, and when you come
   to prayer, you may know God loveth you; and the dearest friend we have
   in the world hath not the thousandth part so much as he: yea, the
   highest angel doth not love God so much as he loveth the lowest saint.
   God loveth like himself, becoming the greatness and infiniteness of has
   own being; and with this persuasion pray to him.

   Secondly, The second ground of audience is from the fruit of his love,
   as demonstrated in the new covenant, wherein we have the matter of
   everlasting consolation. Surely this clause respects not the effect and
   sense in our own hearts, but respects the matter and object of our
   comfort; for he prayeth for the application of it afterwards: Comfort
   your hearts,' &c. And besides, nothing is more fleeting and oftener
   interrupted than our comfort in this life. It would contradict plain
   sense to call that comfort which Christians feel, and actually enjoy,
   everlasting comfort. Therefore I understand it of the matter, and
   observe this doctrine:--

   That God hath given all true believers solid ground of perpetual and
   endless comfort.

   I will prove it by three arguments:--

   1. The comforts propounded are of an everlasting tendency and
   benefit--pardon and life, to free us from everlasting death, and to
   bring us into the possession of everlasting happiness, when our souls
   and bodies shall be for ever glorified in heaven. Now the consolation
   grounded on the promise of eternal life, whatever it be in our feeling,
   is in its causes and foundation eternal. The scripture often insists
   upon this: 1 John ii. 25, And this is the promise that he hath promised
   us, even eternal life;' Heb. v. 9, And being made perfect, he became
   the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.' We have
   by Christ deliverance from sin, and all the consequents of it, not only
   for a time, but for ever; eternal peace and felicity is our portion. So
   it is said, Ps. cxix. 111, Thy testimonies have I taken for an heritage
   for ever; for they are the rejoicing of my heart.' It is not an
   heritage to lean upon for a while, as all our worldly comforts are, but
   for ever: so Ps. lxxiii. 26, God is my portion for ever;' that is, when
   all other things fail, have spent their allowance, can afford us no
   more relief, then we begin to enjoy our true and proper portion. It
   were endless to heap up places. Man for his sin was cast out of
   paradise; but surely in the other world there is no change of estate:
   for men are past their trial, and must be what they are for ever. If
   you could imagine (as some have had the large charity to conceit it)
   that the condition of the wicked should be changed, yet there is no
   reason at all why the state of the godly should be changed, who have
   passed the pikes, and are triumphing with God, that they should ever
   lose that estate again.

   2. They depend on everlasting foundations, such as are these:--

   [1.] The everlasting love of God: Ps. ciii. 17, The mercy of the Lord
   is from everlasting to everlasting on them that fear him.' Not only
   from the beginning of the world to the end of the world, but from
   eternity to eternity. It was an ordinary form of praising God in the
   Old Testament: For his mercy endureth for ever.'

   [2.] The everlasting merit of Christ, which never loseth its force and
   effect: Heb. ix. 12, He hath obtained eternal redemption for us.' Not
   that Christ is always propitiating. No; the work was performed in a
   short time, but the virtue of it is of everlasting continuance.

   [3.] There is an eternal and unchangeable covenant: Heb. xiii. 20,
   Through the blood of the everlasting covenant.' Though the covenant
   made with Israel was abolished, yet this is everlasting, and continueth
   for ever, and shall never be altered; because it was able to reach the
   end for which it was appointed, which is the eternal salvation of man.
   That was a temporary covenant, this eternal. Now, because this is the
   main circumstance, and the next ground of our eternal consolation, the
   covenant of life and peace that God hath made with us in Christ, I
   shall prove the eternal truth and immutable constancy of this covenant.
   That a promise be immutable, certain, and firm, three things are
   required:--

   (1.) That it be seriously and heartily made, with a purpose to perform
   it.

   (2.) That he that hath promised continue in his purpose without change
   of mind.

   (3.) That it be in the power of him that promiseth to perform what he
   hath promised. Now, of all these things there can be no doubt.

   (1.) God meaneth as he speaketh when he promiseth to give eternal life
   to those that believe and obey the gospel. There is no question but he
   is so minded, when he sent the Lord Jesus Christ from heaven to assure
   us of it by his doctrine, to die the death to purchase it for us, and
   afterward to rise again and enter into that happiness that he spake of;
   and as soon as he was ascended up on high, gave gifts to men to give
   notice of this blessed estate to be had upon the terms of his new
   covenant, his Spirit attesting the truth of it by divers signs and
   wonders, partly to alarm the drowsy world to regard it, and assure the
   incredulous world that it is no fable; and because they live not for
   ever, did inspire those holy men, before they went out of the body, to
   write a book of this salvation for the use of the world in all ages. To
   think that God is not serious in all this; is to make him a liar
   indeed; yea, to establish a falsehood with the greatest solemnity and
   demonstration that can be offered to mankind; yea, to make a lie
   necessary, not only to the governing, but sanctifying of the world.
   Surely, then, there is a truth in that great promise which he hath
   promised us, even eternal life.

   (2.) That God doth continue in his purpose without change of mind.
   There is no doubt of it, if we consider his eternal and unchangeable
   nature: Mal. iii. 6, I am the Lord, I change not;' James i. 17, With
   him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.' And what should
   alter his purpose? Doth he meet with anything that he fore saw not, or
   knew not before? No; this is a weakness incident to man; God doth never
   repent and call back his grant, which he hath by this condescending act
   of grace insured to the heirs of promise. 1 Sam. xv. 29, The strength
   of Israel will not lie nor repent, for he is not as man, that he should
   repent;' Ps. cx. 4, I have sworn, and will not repent; thou art a
   priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.' Christ is by oath
   instated in full power of entertaining and blessing his faithful
   servants, which shall never be retracted and reversed. To take off all
   doubt, he hath given double assurance his word and his oath: Heb. vi.
   17, 18, God, being willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of
   promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it with an oath;
   that by two immutable things, wherein it is impossible for God to lie,
   we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold
   on the hope that is set before us.' That we might know that the new
   covenant is unchangeable and irrevocable, and so our comfort be the
   more strong, certain, and stable, God was pleased to give sincere
   believers this double assurance,--by his word and oath, having regard
   to our infirmity, and those many doubts wherewith we are haunted about
   the world to come. God hath ever been tender of his word; above all
   that is famed or believed of him, this is most conspicuous: Ps.
   cxxxviii. 2, Thou has magnified thy word above all thy name;' and Mat.
   xxiv. 35, Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
   away;' and an oath is megi'ste par' anthro'pois pi'stis; and the
   apostle tells us it is pe'ras antilogi'as. It is interposed usually
   indeed in a doubtful matter. But though here it needed not, God would
   show his extraordinary care for our salvation; we see his good-will in
   the promise, his solicitude in the oath; in short, God would never be
   so fast bound, but that he doth and will still continue his purpose.

   (3.) That he is able to perform it. Faith looks to that also; for this
   was the ground and prop of Abraham's faith: Rom. iv. 21, Being fully
   persuaded that what God had promised he was able to perform;' so must
   all Abraham's children that would give glory to God in believing. The
   way of salvation is so rare and mysterious, and so many difficulties
   object themselves to our view, that we are soon puddered, unless we
   reflect upon the power of God. God is able to find out a way whereby
   sinners may be reconciled, our corrupt hearts sanctified, and our sins
   subdued by his Spirit, whereby his interest in us may be preserved
   against the assaults and temptations of the devil, world, and flesh; he
   is able to receive our souls to himself after they flit out of the
   body; and finally, he is able to raise our vile bodies after they are
   eaten out by worms, and turned into dust: Phil. iii. 21, Who shall
   change our vile bodies, that they may be like unto his own glorious
   body; according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all
   things unto himself.' Matters of faith being wholly or mainly future or
   to come, and difficult to be performed, and in the meantime, we being
   exercised with so many trials, an express belief of God's power is
   necessary to convert such an obstinate creature as man is: to sanctify
   such a sinful creature, to preserve us in the midst of temptations, to
   raise the dead, are no slight things.

   3. It is called everlasting consolation,' because it is sufficient to
   do its work; that is to say--

   [1.] To reduce us from temporal and flesh-pleasing vanities. Alas! the
   pleasures of sin are but for a season, not worthy to be compared to the
   recompense of reward which Christ hath promised: Heb. xi. 25, 26,
   Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to
   enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming the reproach of
   Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect
   to the recompense of reward.' Whatever is temporal, we may soon see the
   end of it. All carnal enjoyments, like flowers, wither while we smell
   on them; and the most shining glory in the world is soon burned to a
   snuff; but eternal life, and eternal glory, and eternal pleasure, are
   secured to us by Christ's promise; all the delights in the world are
   but a May-game to these eternal pleasures, which we shall have at God's
   right hand for evermore: Ps. xvi. 11, Thou wilt show me the path of
   life; in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are
   pleasures for evermore.' Now, will you sell your birthright for one
   morsel of meat? part with your eternal inheritance for a little carnal
   satisfaction? We have souls that will not perish; and shall we spend
   our whole time in seeking after things that perish in the using?
   Temporal things carry no proportion with an immortal spirit. We shall
   live for ever; we should look after things that will abide for ever: 1
   John ii. 17, The world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that
   doeth the will of God, abideth for ever.' Otherwise what will you do
   when the soul shall be turned out of doors? To what regions must the
   poor shiftless, harbourless soul betake itself? Surely then this
   consolation, though we feel it not always, and it be frequently
   interrupted, may be well called eternal consolation, because it
   affordeth argument enough to check our worldly and sensual
   inclinations, and to call us off from time to eternity.

   [2.] To make us stedfast in the truth, and cheerful under sufferings,
   for he saith here, The Lord, that hath given us everlasting
   consolation, comfort your hearts and establish you.' The great use of
   everlasting consolation is to comfort and stablish us in a suffering
   condition. The loss of temporal comforts is grievous, but it is
   recompensed with the promise of eternal joys revealed in the gospel:
   Heb. x. 34, Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in
   yourselves that in heaven ye have a better and an enduring substance;
   cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of
   reward.' And all our pains and afflictions are sweetened, so far as to
   keep us from fainting: 2 Cor. iv. 17, 18, Our light affliction, which
   is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
   weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at
   the things that are not seen: for the things which are seen are
   temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.' The end of
   God's covenant and promises is to give us strong consolation in the
   midst of temptations, persecutions, and trials. Worldly joys appear and
   vanish in a moment, every blast of temptation scattereth them. It is
   eternal blessedness which is the cause of solid comfort in all dangers,
   storms, and tempests; hither we retreat as to our sanctuary, and find
   relief. In the world all is unstable and uncertain, but the covenant
   provideth for us eternal joy and bliss.

   [3.] The third effect which it is to produce in us, is an increase of
   holiness, to stablish us in every good word; that is, not only in sound
   doctrine, but in every good work. In holiness of life, our endeavours
   should answer our motives and ends: Abound in the work of the Lord,
   forasmuch as your labour is not in vain in the Lord,' 1 Cor. xv. 58.
   Diligence should not be grievous to us when there is everlasting
   consolation at the back of it; surely this should put life into all our
   endeavours. Should we trifle away that time which we are to improve for
   eternity? John vi. 27, Labour not for the meat that perishes, but for
   that which is to endure to everlasting life.' Faith in Christ, joined
   with solid goodness, will lead you to eternal life. There should be in
   the saints an eternal principle, which is the grace of the Holy Spirit;
   and an eternal end, which is the pleasing, glorifying, and enjoying of
   God; and an eternal rule, which is the will of God; and they will have
   eternal consolation and reward.

   Use, of exhortation:--

   1. Look upon the new covenant as it is in itself, as containing the
   only solid grounds of rejoicing; the blessings of it are real, certain,
   stable, and suitable to the great necessities of mankind. The blessings
   are pardon and life; they are real, no fancies or chimeras. The gospel
   is not a dream or well-devised fable, but the greatest reality in the
   world; it speaketh much for itself, commending itself to the conscience
   by rational evidence: 2 Cor. iv. 2, By manifestation of the truth,
   commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God;'
   but more by the authority of the Son of God, who came from heaven to
   show us the way thither; and if it had not been so, he would have told
   us, John xiv. 2; for he used great plainness of speech and fidelity;
   and is more fully ratified by the Spirit: John xvi. 8-11, He will
   reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.' They are
   stable and unchangeable, as appeareth by the covenant form, in which
   the conveyance is so strong and firm as will make a plea in law: 2 Sam.
   xxiii. 5, He hath made an everlasting covenant with me, ordered in all
   things, and sure,' in which is all my hope and desire, and suitable to
   many necessities. Here is a cure for our great sore by pardon, and
   satisfaction to our desires by a fit happiness.

   2. Let it be so to you; do you fulfil the duties required; if there be
   any room for doubting, it must be of your qualification; therefore that
   must be made more explicit: 1 John iii. 19 Hereby we know that we are
   of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.' We miss much of
   this everlasting consolation, because we are upon such loose terms with
   God: never hope to have peace upon cheaper terms than clear and
   undoubted holiness. You are not to model God's covenant and new make
   it, and bring it down to your humour and liking. No; the covenant is
   unalterable and eternal; so the duties, as well as the privileges. You
   must take it as you find it, and choose the things that please God,
   Isa. lvi. 4. There is your claim; follow that close: Henceforth is laid
   up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
   Judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but to all them
   that love his appearing.'

   3. Carry it so as those to whom God hath given grounds of everlasting
   consolation. We are up when we have the world with us, but dead in the
   nest when our temporal dependences are broken. The covenant is the same
   still; and there should be your hope and your joy: 2 Cor. i. 20, All
   the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of
   God by us;' 2 Sam. xxiii. 5, Although my house be not so with God, yet
   he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things,
   and sure; for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he
   make it not to grow.' Heaven is where it was; the world cannot make
   void your interest in it; therefore you should rejoice in the Lord
   always: Phil. iv. 4, Rejoice in the Lord always; and again, I say
   rejoice.'

SERMON XVI.

   And good hope through grace.--2 Thes. II. 16.

   WE now come to the third ground of audience and acceptance. He hath
   given us good hope through grace.' This showeth how we entertain the
   everlasting consolation offered in the gospel--with good hope, and this
   wrought in us by God. Here is--

   1. The gift: good hope.

   2. The moving cause: through grace.

   Doct. That it is a great advantage, when we pray for consolation and
   confirmation in holiness, to consider that God hath already given us
   the hope of eternal life.

   Here I shall--

   I. Open the gift.

   II. Show what encouragement this is in prayer.

   I. In the opening the gift, let me inquire:--

   1. What is this good hope mentioned, and what are the properties of it?

   2. That this is the free gift of God.

   1. What is this good hope?

   [1.] Hope is sometimes put for the object or thing hoped for; as Prov.
   xiii. 12, Hope deferred maketh the heart sad;' that is, the delay of
   the good expected is very tedious and troublesome to us. So in
   Christian hope: Col. i. 5, For the hope which is laid up for you in
   heaven;' where hope is put for the object of it, the blessed and
   glorious estate which is reserved for us hereafter. The great objects
   of hope, which yet do not exclude intervening blessings, are these:--

   (1.) The coining of Christ to our comfort: Titus ii. 13, Looking for
   the blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our
   Saviour Jesus Christ;' 1 Peter i. 13, Gird up the loins of your minds,
   and be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be brought
   unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.' Hope is there described by
   its singular object, the coming of Christ, called there the revelation
   of Christ. Christ is now under a veil, his bodily presence being
   removed, and his spiritual glory seen but darkly, as in a glass; but
   then he shall appear in person and in his glory. When Christ withdrew
   out of sight, our comfort seemed to be gone with him; but he will come
   again. He is not gone in anger, but about business, to set all things
   at rights against the day of solemn espousals; and then he cometh to
   possess what he hath purchased, and to carry the church into the
   everlasting place of her abode. This is the great hope of Christians,
   and a blessed and good hope it is indeed.

   (2.) The resurrection of the dead: Acts ii. 26, My flesh shall rest in
   hope;' Acts xxiv. 15, I have hope towards God that there shall be a
   resurrection both of the just and unjust;' Acts xxvi. 6-8, Now I stand
   judged for the hope of the promise made unto the fathers, unto which
   promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to
   come. Why should it be thought an incredible thing with you that God
   should raise the dead?' Death seemeth to make void all the promises at
   once; but there is an estate after death; the dead shall rise; and to
   men bred up in the bosom of the church this should not seem incredible.
   It is not incredible in itself, considering the justice and power of
   God. But why to you, since all religion tendeth to it? But it is a
   matter of undoubted certainty all believers do look for, long for, and
   prepare for this blessedness, otherwise why should they trouble
   themselves about religion, which abridgeth us of present delights, and
   exposeth us to great difficulties and sufferings? But there is another
   life after this, where all is happy and joyful, and therefore we serve
   God instantly day and night.'

   (3.) The vision of God, that at length we shall be admitted into his
   blessed presence, and see him as he is, and be made like him both for
   holiness and happiness, 1 John iii. 2.

   (4.) Our heavenly inheritance: 1 Peter i. 4, An inheritance
   incorruptible, and undefiled, that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven
   for us.' Called eternal life: Titus i. 2, In hope of eternal life,
   which God, that cannot lie, promised us.' The glory of God: Rom. v. 2,
   We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.' Well, then, all this is a good
   hope, if there be the things hoped for; for the object of our hope is
   the chiefest good, the eternal vision and fruition of God; this is that
   we must aim at as our happiness: Ps. xvii. 15, As for me, I shall
   behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake
   with thy likeness.' We must seek after it and make it our constant
   work: Heb. xi. 6, God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.'
   This is that we must take hold of, as having a right and title to it:
   Heb. vi. 18, Who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set
   before us.' We challenge it by the law of grace; as we fulfil the
   conditions, our hold is more strong, right more evident; as we get
   greater measures of the first-fruits, we gain more security and
   confidence in the spiritual conflict: ver. 19, Which hope we have as an
   anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast.' By good works we enter upon the
   possession of it, in part, as we get the first-fruits of the Spirit:
   Rom. viii. 23, We ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the
   Spirit, even we ourselves groan within our selves, waiting for the
   adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body;' 2 Cor. v. 5, Now he that
   hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God, who also hath given
   unto us the earnest of the Spirit.' In whole, when we come to heaven,
   for then we enter into our Master's joy.' Mat. xxv. 21. When we die our
   souls enter into that blessed place, where the spirits of just men are
   made perfect; not only preserved in manu Dei, but admitted in
   conspectum Dei: 1 Peter i. 9, Receiving the end of your faith, the
   salvation of your souls.' But after the resurrection and general
   judgment: John xiv. 3, I will come again, and receive you to myself;
   that where I am, there ye may be also.' Then, in body and soul, we
   enter into our everlasting mansions.

   [2.] Sometimes hope is put for the reasons and causes of hoping; and so
   he that giveth me solid reasons of hoping, giveth me good hope. In this
   sense it is taken, Heb. vii. 19, The law made nothing perfect, but the
   bringing in of a better hope did, whereby we draw nigh to God.' By the
   better hope is meant the sure and comfortable promises of the gospel,
   depending merely on the grace of God, which gives hope to lost sinners
   of recovering commerce and communion with God; that is, solid grounds
   upon which they may expect the pardon of their sins and eternal life.
   In this sense, good hope is hope well warranted. The solid reasons are
   contained in the word of God: Rom. xv. 4, Whatsoever things were
   written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we, through
   patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope.' The great end
   of the scriptures is, that we might have a sure hope in God--quod agit
   tota scriptura, ut credamus in Deum. The business of the scripture is
   to bring us to believe in God, and wait upon him for eternal salvation.
   There the rule of commerce between God and us is stated; whatever is
   promised is sure. There may be reason to expect some things from God's
   merciful nature, though we have no promise about them; but the sure and
   certain hope is grounded on the promise; that is an express ground of
   confidence and hope that will never leave us ashamed; it is
   well-grounded hope, therefore good hope, built on the promise and word
   of the eternal God.

   [3.] By the act or grace of hope itself. This may be called good either
   in itself or with respect to the degree.

   (1.) In itself: It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait
   for the salvation of the Lord.' Lam. iii. 26. Bonum is either honestum,
   jucundum, or utile: it is good in all regards. It is our duty to rest
   assured in God's promise. It is pleasant to anticipate and forecast a
   blessing to come. Surely it is delightful to live in the fore sight of
   endless glory. It is profitable to support our hearts under present
   difficulties and troubles, and the uncertainties of the present life.

   (2.) In respect of the degree and measure of it. That is good hope
   which is most able to do its office, when it is lively hope: 1 Peter i.
   3, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which,
   according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again to a lively
   hope;' such as doth most support and quicken us. The more serious and
   earnest our reflections are upon eternal life, the better is the hope:
   Heb. vi. 11, Show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto
   the end.' We should still keep up this sure and desirous expectation.
   Briefly, hope the grace is twofold.

   (1st.) There is a hope which is the immediate effect of regeneration,
   and is a constitutive part of the new creature. Of that the apostle
   speaketh, 1 Peter i. 3, Begotten to a lively hope.' This merely floweth
   from our acceptance of the new covenant, and dependeth upon the
   conditional offer of eternal life. We take it for our happiness,
   resolving to seek it in God's way; without this a man cannot be a
   Christian, till he hope for eternal life to be given him upon Christ's
   terms.

   (2dly.) There is a hope which is the fruit of experience, and belongeth
   to the seasoned and tried Christian, who hath approved his own fidelity
   to God, and hath much trial of God's fidelity and faithfulness to him.
   Of this it is said, Rom. v. 4, that Experience worketh hope.' It
   differeth from the former, because it produceth not only a conditional
   certainty, but an actual confidence of our own salvation. The former is
   necessary, for we live and act by it; the other is very comfortable,
   for it facilitateth all our acts when we know there is reserved for us
   a crown of life, which the righteous Judge will give in that day;' and
   do not only believe a resurrection both of the just and unjust,' but
   our own resurrection unto eternal life.

   But now for the effects. I shall instance in two which suit with the
   prayer in the text--consolation in troubles, and confirmation in
   holiness.

   First, Support in troubles. When we are certainly persuaded of a happy
   issue, we are the better kept from fainting: Phil. i. 19, I know that
   this shall turn to my salvation,' &c. He speaketh it of his troubles,
   and the machinations of his adversaries; and this knowledge he calleth
   in the 20th verse, his earnest expectation and his hope.' The bitterest
   cross is sweetened by hope. This carried him through his sufferings,
   not only with patience, but comfort; as men in a storm, when they see
   land, take courage; it is but enduring a little more tempest and they
   shall be safe on shore. To a hoping Christian, his whole life is a
   rough voyage, but a short one.

   Secondly, To encourage us in working. It is hope sets the whole world
   a-work: 1 Cor. ix. 10, That he that plougheth should plough in hope;
   and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.'
   Certainly it is hope sets the Christian a-work: Acts xxvi. 7, Unto
   which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night,
   hope to come.' Why are God's children so hard at work for God, but out
   of love to him, and hope to enjoy him for ever? Oh! let us continually
   be serving God. Let us live always either for heaven, as seeking it, or
   upon heaven, as solacing ourselves with the hopes of it; do whatever we
   do in order to eternal life, and not be taken up with trifles, and this
   will put life into our endeavours. It is for a glorious and blessed
   estate on which we employ all this labour.

   2. That this is the free gift of God. I must prove two things:--

   [1.] That good hope is his gift. He doth not only give us objective
   grace,--this is the free and undeserved mercy of the gospel, or a
   sufficient warrant to hope for it, which are his gracious promises; but
   subjective grace: the hope by which we expect this blessedness is
   freely wrought in us by his Holy Spirit, which is a further
   confirmation of his love to us, that he hath not only given us the
   blessedness we hope for, but the very hope itself. The Spirit's work is
   necessary--

   (1.) By way of illumination, to open the eyes of our minds, that we may
   see what is the hope of his calling.' Eph. i. 18. Alas! otherwise our
   sight cannot pierce so far, nor discern any reality in a happiness that
   lieth in an unseen and an unknown world, so as to venture and forsake
   all that we see and love for a God and a glory that we never saw.
   Nature, if it be not blind in discerning the duty of man, yet it is
   purblind; it cannot foresee the happiness of man, which lieth afar off
   from us: 2 Peter i. 9, But he that lacketh these things is blind, and
   cannot see afar off.' A short-sighted man cannot see things at a
   distance from him: not from any defect in the object, but through the
   fault in his eyes. So the natural man, blinded by delusions, doth
   either not believe, or forget the world to come; though these things be
   set before him in the promises of the gospel, they leave no impression
   upon his heart. There needeth a very quick sight to be able to look
   from earth to heaven; therefore, till we are enlightened by the Spirit,
   we can have no saving knowledge of those things which pertain to the
   kingdom of God or eternal life.

   (2.) By way of inclination. The Spirit doth not only open the eyes of
   our mind, but he doth also incline our hearts to mind and seek after
   these things as our portion and happiness: Acts xvi. 14, God opened the
   heart of Lydia.' There is an opening of our mind, and an opening of our
   hearts necessary; for the wisdom of the flesh is kneaded into our
   natures, and we are prepossessed and entangled with divers foolish and
   hurtful lusts. Though we know these things, we regard them not, and
   therefore the work of the Spirit is necessary to incline us earnestly
   to look and long, and patiently to wait, for blessedness to come: Gal.
   v. 5, For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
   faith.' Alas! otherwise we should never regard these things, certainly
   we would not wait for them with so much patience and self-denial, and
   solace our hearts with these hopes in the midst of all our labours,
   adversities, and troubles, when all is in expectation, and so little in
   possession.

   (3.) By way of excitation, he doth quicken us and comfort us, by
   raising our thoughts, desires, and endeavours after the promised glory
   and blessedness: Rom. xv. 13, Now, the God of hope fill you with all
   joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope through the
   power of the Holy Ghost.' It is by his lively impressions that this
   grace is acted in us with any profit; our hope is acted and increased
   by his power, blessing the promises of the gospel to this end.

   [2.] That it is his free gift. That which moveth God to give us this
   hope is his mere love and grace.

   (1.) The matter of hope is God's free, undeserved mercy. The mercy of
   God is everywhere made the great invitation of hope to the fallen
   creature: Ps. cxxx. 7, Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord
   is mercy and plenteous redemption.' Without this there were no hope for
   us, and therefore the saints make this their anchor-hold: Ps. xiii. 5,
   I have trusted in thy mercy, therefore my soul shall rejoice in thy
   salvation;' let others trust in what they will, Lord, I will trust in
   thy mercy. This is that which maketh hope lift up the head: Jude 21,
   Looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life;'
   there is our best and strongest plea. But--

   (2.) For the grace of hope, it is the mere fruit of the Lord's mercy;
   such are our undeservings and ill-deservings, that nothing else could
   in cline him to give us this hope. He was not induced by any merits of
   ours, which are none; nor hindered by any demerits or sins of ours,
   which were many and great; only his grace moved him to bring us under
   the hopes of the gospel, that we might set ourselves with longing and
   certain expectation in the way of holiness, to seek after the eternal
   enjoyment of himself: 1 Peter i. 3, Of his abundant mercy he hath
   begotten us to a lively hope.' There were so many provocations on our
   part, such great privileges to be enjoyed, that nothing but abundant
   mercy could give us this hope.

   II. What encouragement is this in prayer, if God hath given us good
   hope through grace?

   1. God would not invite and raise a hope to disappoint it; for surely
   the Lord will not deceive his creature that dependeth upon his word,
   and therefore we are allowed to challenge him: Ps. cxix. 49, Remember
   thy word unto thy servant, on which thou hast caused me to hope.' The
   words contain a double argument: the promise was of God's making, and
   the hope of his operation,--it is thy word, and thou hast caused me to
   hope; his grant in the new covenant, and his influence by the Spirit.
   We have a strong tie upon him, as he giveth us the promise, which is a
   ground of hope. Surely we may put his bonds in suit, Chirographa tua
   tibi injiciebat, Domine. But when his Spirit hath caused us to hope, it
   is not with a purpose to defeat it; and therefore we may expect
   necessary blessings, such as are support and establishment in holiness.
   Sometimes God promiseth that we may believe, and then promiseth again
   because we do believe and trust in him: Isa. xxvi. 3, Thou wilt keep
   him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth
   in thee.' Actual hope and trust giveth a fresh claim or new interest,
   for God will not fail a trusting soul, as a generous man will not fail
   his friend if he rely on him. We count this to be the strongest bond we
   can lay upon another, to be mindful of us, and faithful to us--I wholly
   trust upon you. Now, much more will God do so: when he hath sent his
   work before, he will bring his reward with him; when he hath invited
   hope by his promise, and caused hope by his Spirit, he will give the
   mercy you hope for, for he hath prepared you for it by his preventing
   grace. I remember the prophet telleth God, Jer. xx. 7, O Lord, thou
   hast deceived me, and I was deceived;' words that seem to intrench upon
   the honour of God. Some interpret them as if they were spoken by the
   prophet in a passion; others soften them by another rendering, Thou
   hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded,' that is, to undertake the
   prophetical office, to which I was nothing forward of myself, and have
   found it more troublesome than I expected. But why may not the words be
   spoken as a supposition: If I be deceived, thou hast deceived me'? God
   had told him that he would make him as a brazen wall, and had raised a
   faith and hope in him that he would hear him out in his work; and so it
   signifies no more but I cannot be deceived.' When you have God's word,
   and a well-grounded hope, it is not a foolish imagination or vain
   expectation. God will not deceive a poor creature that trusts in him
   for necessary things, such as perseverance and establishment in
   holiness.

   2. He that giveth us hope will give us all things necessary to the
   thing hoped for; therefore when God hath called us to the hope of
   eternal glory by Jesus Christ, we may with the more confidence pray for
   necessary support and establishment in the way. This argument seemeth
   to be urged by the apostle: 1 Peter v. 10, The God of all grace, who
   called you to his heavenly glory by Jesus Christ, after ye have
   suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.'
   God, that called us to eternal glory, foresaw the difficulties and
   troubles we should meet with by the way, and therefore provided grace
   answerable, which we are to sue out by prayer. Surely he that called
   them to the possession of everlasting blessedness by the Mediator, did
   not flatter them into a vain hope, as it will prove, if he help us not.
   Therefore he will assist us in these difficulties, and though he will
   not exempt us from the conflict, yet he will not deny strength. When we
   consent to his calling, it is a sure ground to our faith that he that
   hath called will give us all things necessary to our perseverance; for
   his calling, when it is effectual, will not be in vain and to no
   purpose: 1 Cor. i. 9, God is faithful, by whom ye were called into the
   fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord;' 1 Cor. x. 13, There hath
   no temptation taken you but what is common to men: but God is faithful,
   who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will
   with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to
   bear it.' The intent of his calling is to bring them to the possession
   of what he hath called them to. If he would at first take us with all
   our faults, and put us under the hopes of the gospel when we were
   sinners, he will follow the first grace with continual aids and
   supports, until he hath perfected his work; and therefore, when a
   people are sincere, and willing to run all hazards for Christ, God will
   not only give them glory at the end of their journey, but bear their
   expenses by the way; and therefore we need not be discouraged, and say,
   How shall we hold out? God, that hath given such hope as to venture
   upon the difficulties, will support you under them; he will add more
   grace to that grace that we have received.

   3. They that have received good hope through grace, have God's nature
   and promise to rest upon; his nature, as he is a gracious God, and his
   promise, as he is a faithful God.

   [1.] His nature, as he is a God merciful and gracious. That former
   experience doth fully manifest; he is sufficiently inclined to do us
   good, and therefore will not fail us in our necessities. He hath ever
   borne us good-will, never discovered any backwardness to help us,
   thought of us before the world was, sent his Son to die for us before
   we were born or had a being in the world, called us when we were
   unworthy, warned us of our danger when we did not fear it, offered
   happiness to us when we had no thought of it; and lest we should turn
   our backs upon it, followed us with an earnest and incessant
   importunity, till we came to anxious thoughts about Christ, and began
   to make it our business to seek after it; by the secret drawings of his
   Spirit, inclined us to choose him for our portion, and to rejoice in
   the hopes offered. How many contradictions and stragglings of heart
   were we conscious to ere we were brought to this! Ever since he hath
   been tender of us in the whole conduct of his providence; afflicted us
   when we needed it, delivered us when we were ready to sink; hath
   pardoned our failings, visited us in ordinances, supported us in
   doubts, helped us in temptations, and is still mindful of us at every
   turn, as if he would not lose us; and shall not we hope in him to the
   last? We may reason as they, Judges xiii. 23, If the Lord had a mind to
   destroy us, he would not have received a sacrifice at our hands.' And
   so if God had no mind to save us, he would not use such methods of
   grace about us.

   [2.] His promise, so that we must trust his faithfulness, after we come
   under the hopes of the gospel. There are two great promises to support
   us: his presence with us in the midst of our afflictions, and our being
   ever present with the Lord in eternal glory. This is that we have hope
   of; all the difficulty is, how far God hath promised his presence with
   us. Certainly he hath promised it: Ps. xci. 15, I will be with them in
   troubles;' and again, I will be with them in fire and water.' And
   again, certain it is, that God is most with his afflicted people, as
   the mother keepeth most with the sick child, or the blood runneth to
   comfort the wounded part. And again, that he will never leave us to
   unsupportable difficulties: Heb. xiii. 5, I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you;' a negative gradation. And besides, there is a general
   promise, though the particulars be not absolutely made certain to us;
   namely, that all shall work together for good,' Rom. viii. 28. That
   giveth us but a probability of health, and outward protection, and
   deliverance, of a ready support in every temptation, because we are
   uncertain how far they are for our good; but for necessary grace to our
   preservation, there is express provision in the covenant: Jer. xxxii.
   40, I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
   away from them to do them good,' &c.

   4. It giveth us encouragement in prayer; because they that have this
   hope are so much exposed to the scorn of the world, because they trust
   in an invisible God, and look for all their recompense in a world to
   come. They think Christians are a company of credulous fools, that
   please themselves with dreams and fancies: Ps. xxii. 7, 8, They laugh
   me to scorn, because, they say, he trusted in the Lord;' 1 Tim. iv. 10,
   We therefore labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living
   God.' Christians thought their reward sure, and therefore endured all
   things; but atheists and infidels scoff at them, and at all their
   comforts, as fanatical illusions, and persecute them. Therefore God is
   in point of honour engaged to stand by them, and to justify their hope
   and trust; not always by temporal deliverance, but by spiritual support
   and establishment; that it may be seen there is a Spirit of God and
   glory resteth upon them, that is glorified by him, however he be evil
   spoken of in the world, 1 Peter iv. 14. God will do so in condescension
   to his people. Nothing goeth so near their hearts as a disappointment
   of their hope in God. It is a mighty damp to their spirits when God
   doth as it were spit in their faces, and reject their prayers: Ps. xxv.
   2, O my God! I trust in thee; let me not be ashamed.' At such times the
   Lord seemeth to countenance the slanders of their enemies, and to cover
   their faces with shame.

   Use 1. To persuade you to get this hope of eternal life wrought in your
   hearts.

   1. This is the characteristic and note of difference betwixt God's
   people and others. By this we are distinguished from pagans, who are
   described to be such as Have no hope, and without God in the world.'
   Eph. ii. 12; and 1 Thes. iv. 13, Sorrow not as them without hope.' But
   Christians are such as have good hope through grace;' and by this we
   are distinguished from temporary and slight believers: Heb. iii. 6, His
   house we are, if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of hope firm
   unto the end;' so also ver. 14, If we hold the beginning of our
   confidence stedfast unto the end.' Their hope is slight and fluid: the
   temporary loseth his joy and comfort, which he conceived in the offers
   of the gospel, and so either casts off the profession of godliness, or
   neglecteth the power and practice of it; but the true Christian is
   serious, patient, heavenly, and holy; because he is always looking to
   his end, and sweeteneth his work by his great hope, keeping up his
   taste or lively expectation of the mercy of Christ to everlasting life.
   Nay, this differenceth the children of God, those that are in their
   conflict from those that are in their triumph, the sanctified and
   glorified; those that are in their way, and those that are at home.
   They that are at home are enjoying what we expect, and in possession of
   that supreme good that we yet hope for; they have neither miseries to
   fear nor blessings to desire beyond what they do enjoy; they see what
   they love, and possess what they see. But the time of our advancement
   is not yet come, and therefore we can only look and long for it; this
   is our work and present happiness.

   2. Now the covenant of God is contrived to raise hope in us. The Jachin
   and Boaz, the two pillars that support it, are mercy and truth: Micah
   vii. 20, Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to
   Abraham;' Ps. xxv. 10, All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth
   unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies;' and Ps. cxxxviii.
   2, I will praise thy name for thy loving-kindness and truth; for thou
   hast magnified thy word above all thy name;' and in many other
   scriptures.

   [1.] The mercy and grace of the covenant.

   I.) In the frame of it, where excellent benefits are dispensed upon
   free terms, that our faith and hope may be in God. The Lord would not
   leave the sinful creature under despair, but hath provided a way how we
   may be reconciled and glorified: Ps. cxxx. 4, There is forgiveness with
   thee, that thou mayest be feared.' Mercy opens the door for us; the
   very offer speaks much mercy, the terms are mercy. So much duty is
   required as is necessary, and doth arise from the nature of the thing.
   Violence would be offered to the reason of a serious creature, if such
   things were not required.

   (2.) In the dispensations of the blessings of the covenant. Now, Gal.
   vi. 16, To as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them,
   and mercy, and on the Israel of God.' There are many infirmities and
   frailties, but God passeth them by when there is sincerity. Our faith
   is weak, and mingled with doubtings, our love to God clogged with much
   inordinate self-love, our obedience often interrupted, too much
   deadness and coldness in holy things; yet these do not cast us out of
   the favour of God, nor make void our interest in the covenant, where
   the heart for the main is set to serve him, and please him: Mal. iii.
   17, I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.'

   (3.) At the very close of all it is grace: Hope unto the end, for the
   grace that is brought unto you at the revelation of Christ,' 1 Peter i.
   13. Then there will be the fullest and largest manifestation of God's
   love and free grace. There is grace brought to us now, by the
   revelation of Jesus Christ in the gospel; but when his person shall be
   revealed, grace shall be seen in all its graciousness. We see his grace
   in the pardon of sins, and that measure of sanctification which now we
   attain unto, that he is pleased to pass by our offences, and take us
   into his family, and give us right to his heavenly kingdom, and some
   taste of his love and remote service. But when pardon shall be
   pronounced by the judge's mouth, when he shall take us not only into
   his family, but into his palace and Father's house, and give us not
   right only, but possession, and we shall be admitted to the immediate
   vision and fruition of God, and be everlastingly employed in heavenly
   praising and delighting in him, then grace will be grace indeed.

   [2.] His truth and mercy openeth the door for us. Truth keepeth it
   open; mercy is the pipe; truth is the conveyance. Now God bindeth
   himself by promise, and hath ever been tender of his word. We may see
   for the present that a covenant-interest is no fruitless thing. He hath
   confirmed this hope to the world by miracles; to us within the church
   by the seal and earnest of his Spirit, or the impression of his image,
   preparing the hearts of the faithful for this blessed estate: Eph. iv.
   30, Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the
   day of redemption;' 2 Cor. v. 5, Who hath given us the earnest of his
   Spirit.' He hath appointed ordinances to revive our hopes: 1 Cor. xi.
   26, For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show
   the Lord's death till he come.' By daily experience we see many of
   God's children have gone out of the world cheerfully professing this
   hope; we have the same Father, of whom the whole family in heaven and
   earth is named.' Eph. iii. 15; are reconciled to him by the same
   Christ: Col. i. 20, Having made peace through the blood of the cross,
   by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they
   be things in earth, or things in heaven.' If he be so good to that part
   of the family that is now in heaven, he will be good to them also that
   are working out their salvation with fear and trembling.

   [3.] What an advantage it is to the spiritual life to have good hope
   wrought in us through grace.

   (1.) It maketh us diligent and serious. Christianity implieth a serious
   application of our heart and mind to do what Christ requireth, that we
   may obtain what he hath offered; to do it as our first work and chief
   business: Phil. ii. 12, Work out your own salvation with fear and
   trembling;' Heb. iv. 1, Let us labour to enter into that rest;' that
   is, employ our utmost care and diligence. Now all the executive powers
   are fortified and strengthened in their operation by hope.

   (2.) To be patient and mortified, that we subdue our lusts, and bear
   the loss of our interests with an humble and quiet mind: Rom. xii. 12,
   Patient in tribulation, rejoicing in hope.' And for lusts: 1 John iii.
   3, He that hath this hope, purifieth himself even as he is pure.'

   (3.) To be heavenly and holy; the one respects our end, the other our
   race. For it is not a few dead lifeless thoughts now and then, bat the
   continual and delightful foresight of eternal bliss. What is the way to
   heaven but hope? And who more pure and holy than they that look for
   such things? 2 Peter iii. 14, Wherefore, beloved, seeing ye look for
   such things, be diligent that ye be found of him in peace, without
   spot, and blameless.'

   Use 2. Well, then, get this hope. But what must we do? You will say, It
   is God's gift: yet you are bound to use the means.

   1. Remove the impediments: 1 Peter i. 13, Be sober, and hope to the
   end.' Draw off the affections from carnal vanities, and the delights of
   the senses, and consider what God offereth to you in the gospel: there
   can be no certain and desirous expectation of better things, while the
   mind and heart is so occupied and thronged with vanity, and deadened by
   carnal satisfaction.

   2. Wait on all the opportunities of profiting, and use the known means
   of grace more conscionably. Certain it is that the grace of hope is of
   God, not acquired, but infused; but God will bless his own means. The
   propounding of the object, the offering of the solid grounds, maketh
   way for the infusing of the grace: Titus i. 1, 2, Paul was the apostle
   to bring them to the acknowledgment of the truth, for the hope of
   eternal life.' And it is called, the hope of the gospel,' Col. i. 23,
   because it is wrought by the preaching of the gospel.

SERMON XVII.

   Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.--2
   Thes. II. 17.

   WE come now, thirdly, to the prayer itself. He asketh two benefits:--

   1. Comfort.

   2. Establishment.

   First, Comfort: Comfort your hearts.' But why doth the apostle pray for
   that which they had already? He had told them, in the former verse,
   that God had given them everlasting consolation, and now he prayeth
   that God would comfort them. The answer given by some is, that he
   prayeth that God would give them an increase of comfort; by others,
   that God would give them the continuance of it. Bather, by everlasting
   consolation is meant the solid matter of comfort; by his prayer, now
   the effectual application of it; for though sufficient matter of
   comfort be provided for us, yet God must powerfully apply it. The
   gospel is a sovereign plaster, yet God's hand must make it stick.
   Observe here:--

   Doct. That all true and solid and heart-comfort is of God. He is called
   the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort,' 2 Cor. i. 3; and
   again, The God of patience and consolation.' Rom. xv. 5. His Spirit
   taketh an office upon him to accomplish, this effect in us, therefore
   called the Comforter.

   1. I shall inquire what comfort is.

   2. Show why it is of God.

   3. What advantage we have thereby.

   I. What comfort is. Three things are to be explained:--

   1. Comfort.

   2. Comforting.

   3. In what sense it is of God.

   I. 1. What comfort is. We call two things by that name:--

   [1.] Our natural refreshment.

   [2.] Our support in troubles.

   [1.] Our natural refreshment, or the benefit that we have by the
   creatures for the support of nature. We cannot enjoy our temporal
   mercies with any delight and pleasure without God's leave and blessing;
   as to eat and drink with comfort, that the soul may enjoy good by its
   labour. In one place it is said, it is by the hand of God,' Eccles. ii.
   24. In another place it is said to be the gift of God.' Eccles. iii.
   13. It is by his power and his grace that the comfort of the creature
   is not in man's hands but God's; nor can the creature yield to us any
   comfort without his gift or grant. And because of our forfeiture by
   sin, we have neither these mercies from ourselves, nor the use; nor the
   natural benefit from the bare creature, which is health, strength, and
   cheerfulness. All goodness resideth chiefly in God, and it is to be
   found in the creatures only by participation, and that at his pleasure:
   Acts xiv. 17, He gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
   filling our hearts with food and gladness;' that is, for the
   comfortable use of food, we must still look to the giver. But the
   apostle here doth not speak of the comfort of the creatures, but the
   comfort of the scriptures; not the supply of the body, but the support
   of the soul.

   [2.] Comfort is taken for support in troubles. The Thessalonians were
   now under great persecutions. Comfort is a strengthening of the mind
   when it is in danger to be weakened by fears and sorrows, or the
   strength and stay of the heart in trouble: Ps. cxix. 50, This is my
   comfort in my afflictions, thy word hath quickened me;' and 2 Cor. i.
   4, Who comforteth us in all our tribulations, that we may be able to
   comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort where with we are
   comforted of God.' As cordials are for a fainting time, so are comforts
   for a time of afflictions. Indeed spiritual comfort is never out of
   season; because we are now in the house of our pilgrim age, and our
   chief good is at a distance from us; and because of the labours and
   difficulties of the spiritual life: therefore it is said, Acts ix. 31,
   When the churches had rest, they walked in the fear of God, and the
   comfort of the Holy Ghost.' But the great need of comfort is in our
   afflictions, therefore here I shall show three things:--

   (1.) That God can give his people comfort in the greatest tribulation:
   his favour is enough to support them against the frowns of all the
   world: Isa. li. 12, I, even I, am he that comforteth thee. Who art thou
   that thou shouldest be afraid of man that shall die, and the son of man
   that shall be made as the grass?' As long as we have the almighty and
   immortal God to stand by us, and the promise of eternal life, it will
   counterbalance all our trouble: Rom. v. 2, 3, We rejoice in hope of the
   glory of God: and not only so, but we glory in tribulations also;' 2
   Cor. iv. 17, This light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
   for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.' There is
   everlasting joy against a heaviness for a season, and everlasting ease
   and rest against a little present pain; there is enough to outweigh all
   that we can suffer for and from God. So the pardon of sin: Isa, xl. 1,
   2, Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith my God.' Why? Because her
   iniquity is pardoned.' Mat. ix. 2, Be of good cheer; thy sin is
   forgiven thee.' Here is sound comfort, the sting of all our troubles is
   taken away. Well, then, this the people of God have to support them in
   all their tribulation. They can set God against the creature, heaven
   against earth, pardon of sins against all the bitterness they meet with
   in the world.

   (2.) That there is a special allowance of comfort for God's children in
   their afflictions. The Lord is more tender of his people then, when
   they want comfort, than at another time; they have a more plentiful
   measure of the supporting operations of his Spirit then: as 1 Peter iv.
   14, If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the
   Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.' As the mother keepeth
   most with the sick child, so God looketh to the afflicted. This is the
   difference between God and the world: the world ever runneth most after
   those that are prosperous, and flourish and rejoice, as rivers into the
   sea, where there is water enough; but forsaketh those that are in
   poverty, disgrace, and want; but God is most mindful of his afflicted
   people, visiteth them most, vouchsafeth most of his comfortable
   presence to those that holily and meekly bear the afflictions he layeth
   upon them: He comforteth us in all our tribulations,' 2 Cor. i. 4. The
   soul is then more capable of spiritual comforts, because their taste is
   more purged and refined from the dregs of sense, and grace is more
   lively and exercised now; the more grace, the more comfort. And prayers
   are more frequent; and prayers are seldom in vain.

   (3.) That our comforts carry proportion with our sorrows: 2 Cor. i. 5,
   As our afflictions abound, so do our consolations.' This cometh from
   the wisdom of God, that the evil may not be greater than our support;
   and from the faithfulness of God, who will not suffer us to be tempted
   above what we are able to bear,' 1 Cor. x. 13. And therefore, if he
   bring on heavy troubles, he puts a suitable measure of comfort and
   cheerfulness into our hearts. This is comfort.

   2. What it is to have our hearts comforted. It showeth that the heart
   is the proper seat of spiritual comfort: Ps. iv. 7, Thou hast put
   gladness into my heart.' God's comfort is like a soaking shower, that
   goes to the root, and refresheth the plants of the earth more than a
   morning dew, that wets only the surface. Other comforts tickle the
   senses and refresh the outward man, but this penetrateth to the very
   heart. Christ prayeth, John xvii. 13, That they may have my joy
   fulfilled in themselves.' Christ's comforts are not reported to the ear
   only, but felt in the heart. The joy of the world maketh a great noise,
   but in the midst of it the heart is sorrowful. But God feasts his
   children with hidden manna; they have meat and drink which the world
   knoweth not of. In their outward man they are exposed to great
   difficulties, but their hearts are filled with joy unspeakable, and
   full of glory.' The joy of the carnal in outward things is foreign; and
   as much as their senses are pleased, their hearts are full of
   tormenting fears and secret disgusts. They may put a good face upon it,
   but dig the most jovial of them to the bottom, they have their inward
   stings and secret horrors of conscience. But in comforting his children
   God chiefly deals with the heart: Rom. v. 5, The love of God is shed
   abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto. us;' and 2 Cor. i.
   22, He hath given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.' In
   establishing this comfort, God doth immediately work upon the soul. He
   useth means indeed; as the word: Rom. xv,. 4, 4 That you through
   patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.' There we have
   the grounds of comfort set forth--Christ's redemption, the promises of
   the gospel, both of pardon and life, and the ordinances, as the
   sacraments; as the eunuch after his baptism: Acts viii. 39, He went
   away rejoicing.' So in the Lord's Supper, we come to eat of Christ's
   peace-offerings that we may rejoice in God: Ps. xxii. 26, The meek
   shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise the Lord that seek him:
   your heart shall live for ever.' But his Spirit worketh immediately
   upon the soul; either--(1.) By opening the understanding to see the
   grounds and reasons of comfort: Rom. xv. 13, Now the God of hope fill
   you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope,
   through the power of the Holy Ghost;' or (2.) By raising the heart to
   the lively act of joy: Acts xiii. 52, The disciples were filled with
   joy, and with the Holy Ghost.' Certainly God comforteth the heart both
   ways by seeing the grounds as he worketh faith. Man is a reasonable
   creature, and it is not imaginable that the Holy Ghost should comfort
   us we know not why: he revealeth indeed supernatural grounds of
   comfort; but if they be not evident to reason, they are evident to
   faith. But then the very joy is executed by the efficacy of his
   impression. But of that more anon.

   3. In what sense comfort may be said to be of God? I answer--Three
   ways:--

   [1.] When it is allowed by him.

   [2.] When the matter is provided by him.

   [3.] When it is wrought by him.

   [1.] When it is allowed by him, and warranted by him. Every man affects
   comfort and oblectation of mind; for otherwise they could never be
   pleased in that condition they are in, nor satisfy themselves. It would
   much undeceive the carnal world, and make them see the folly of their
   unreasonable joy and quiet, if they would put conscience to the
   question, Is our joy from God or no? that is, Doth God allow it me?
   Certainly God doth allow us to rejoice in our outward portion: Eccles.
   v. 18, It is good and comely for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy the
   good of all his labours that he taketh under the sun, all the days of
   his life which God giveth him, for it is his portion;' but so that his
   favour may be the matter of our chief joy, for otherwise it is
   exceeding folly and gross carnality to rejoice in the creature apart
   from God. And in the midst of the greatest soul-dangers, you must first
   inquire, Are all things right between God and me? It is a mighty
   contempt of God, yea, brutish atheism, to sit down contented with
   anything on this side God, Luke xii. 19, and to say, Soul, take thine
   ease, thou hast goods laid up for many years.' To sing lullabies to our
   souls when God is angry for sin, this comfort is not allowed by God:
   There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.' Isa. lvii. 21. It is
   spiritual madness to dance about the brink of hell.

   [2.] When the matter is provided by him. God in the new covenant hath
   propounded excellent grounds of comfort: John xiv. 1, Let not your
   hearts be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me.' The two
   great general grounds of support against heart-trouble are God's
   merciful nature and Christ's mediation; more particularly in the new
   covenant, the promises of pardon and life,--of pardon of sin: Rom. v.
   1-3, Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
   our Lord Jesus Christ,' &c.; and of life eternal: 1 Thes. iv. 18, And
   so shall we ever be with the Lord; wherefore comfort one another with
   these words.' It is good to see what comforts we live upon and propound
   to ourselves and others, more expressly as to afflictions, God's
   particular providence, that nothing falleth out with out God's
   appointment: 1 Thes. iii. 3, That no man should be moved with these
   afflictions, for yourselves know that we were appointed thereunto.' It
   is not chance or a natural accident, but that which God hath appointed.
   If any Shimei rail, the Lord hath bid him curse. If any evil come to
   us, is it without God's fatherly care over his people, who ordereth all
   things for their profit? Heb. xii. 10, They verily for a few days
   chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we
   might be partakers of his holiness.' And his unchangeable love, which
   doth not vary and alter with our condition: Heb. xii. 6, Whom the Lord
   loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.' He is
   our God still, though he seemeth to deal hardly with us. We learn of
   Christ on the very cross to cry, My God.' Mat. xxvii. 46; and if we
   cannot find enough in him when the creatures and our natural comforts
   fail, it is meet we should lose them: Hab. iii. 18, Though the fig-tree
   should not blossom, &c., yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in
   the God of my salvation.' This is the sum of God's comforts; and when
   these things are suggested to us, God comforteth our hearts.

   [3.] When by these means God worketh comfort in us. Joy is often called
   the comfort of the Spirit,' and joy in the Holy Ghost,' Rom. xiv. 17.
   Now all the Spirit's works are singular, and do much exceed the natural
   work of man's heart. The groans which he stirreth up in prayer are
   unutterable.' Rom. viii. 26; his joys unspeakable and glorious,' 1
   Peter i. 8. The heathens counted that fire more fit and pure for their
   altars which was enkindled by a sunbeam rather than a coal taken from a
   common hearth. So this comfort which is raised in us by the Holy Ghost
   is more rich and glorious and effective than that which is the fruit of
   our bare reason, or the mere working of our human spirit, even in the
   common grounds of Christian comfort; or as elementary fire differeth
   from culinary and kitchen fire, and is much more pure, so doth this
   joy, which is immediately wrought in us by the Spirit, from all joy
   that we can work by ourselves, out of the scriptural grounds of
   comfort. Carnal men have their joy at the second or third hand, as God
   blesseth the order and influence of inferior causes; it comes to them
   from creature to creature, so as they discern not the work of God in
   it; yea, the joy of common Christians in the proper grounds of comfort
   is not so strong as that which is raised in us by the immediate
   impression of the comforting Spirit.

   II. Why this is of God.

   1. Because God challengeth this as his own right to comfort the heart
   of man; and therefore, whatever the means of the comfort be, God will
   be owned as the spring and fountain of it. He keepeth this as his great
   bridle upon the world, to govern the hearts of men: Job xxxiv. 29, When
   he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his
   face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or
   against a man only.' Our peace and trouble is in God's hands, and at
   his disposing. It is true he exerciseth his sovereignty according to
   law, and in his internal government according to the law of grace,
   penally withdrawing his comforting Spirit, and leaving us to our
   doubts, and troubles, and fears; by the rewarding our obedience and
   faithfulness with the manifest tokens of his love, as the matter shall
   require. It is enough for the point in hand that God alone doth
   powerfully dispense peace or trouble. And when he will give comfort,
   none can make his gift void; for it is at his command; and in both, a
   nation is all one with a particular person as to any ability to resist
   God.

   2. Though grounds of comfort be never so clear, yet if God concur not,
   we find not the effect; therefore it is his Spirit that can only
   comfort the heart. To have God's warrant for our comfort is much, but
   to have his impression is more; both must concur, or the soul will not
   be comforted. It falleth out many ways, sometimes out of ignorance.
   When a well of comfort was near, poor Hagar saw it not, and was almost
   famished with thirst, until God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of
   water.' Gen. xxi. 19. We know not the grounds of our comfort. Sometimes
   out of passion; grief is obstinate, and will admit no remedy: as Rachel
   would not be comforted,' Jer. xxxi. 15. They are so peevishly addicted
   to their worldly comforts, that if they be crossed in them, they will
   not admit of God's comforts, though they are evident, clear, and
   pertinent. Sometimes out of forgetfulness: Heb. xii. 5, Ye have
   forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children.'
   And oblivion is an ignorance for the present. Had they remembered, they
   would not have fainted and waxed weary. It is a great work of the
   Spirit to bring to remembrance. Sometimes questioning their interest in
   comfort; besides that, there are general comforts, when interest is not
   clear. Now the Spirit, that showeth us the things given us of God, doth
   also reveal and evidence our right to them. What is wrought in our
   hearts that is to say, by quickening us to exercise grace,--he
   evidenceth the truth of grace; and in our afflictions by patience
   maketh out our comfort: Rom. v. 3-5, We glory in tribulations, knowing
   that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and
   experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God
   is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto
   us.' From the whole, there can be no true solid comfort but what God
   bestoweth; his favour, and our interest in his favour, is manifested to
   us by his Spirit.

   III. What advantages we have by this, that all solid comfort is of God.

   1. It assureth us of God's readiness to comfort poor afflicted
   creatures that humbly submit to him. He that is the God of all comfort
   is also the Father of mercies; his mercy and compassion inclineth him
   to comfort us. God hath his name from this effect--Nomina sunt a
   notioribus--God that comforteth those that are cast down,' 2 Cor. vii.
   6. He is very tender of all afflicted creatures, much more of his
   people.

   2. God's comforts come with more authority, and silence all our doubts
   and fears: Ps. xciv. 19, In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy
   comforts delight my soul.' We have many intricate, perplexing thoughts,
   out of which we cannot disentangle ourselves; no comforts come with
   such authority and power as God's comforts. In the comfort we have it
   is good to consider whence it cometh: Is it God's comfort, or a fancy
   of our own? If it be made up by our own fancy, it will be like a
   spider's web, that is weaved out of its own bowels, but is gone and
   swept away with the least turn of a besom; but God's comforts are more
   durable: they flow from the true fountain of comfort, upon whose frowns
   or smiles our happiness and misery dependeth. There is little warmth in
   a fire of our own kindling. God's comforts are built on his covenant,
   and have a commanding force and over powering efficacy on the soul. God
   in his word speaketh by sovereign authority; in our hearts he worketh
   by powerful efficacy. The authority of his word we own when we speak to
   others or to ourselves, when we know trouble but in supposition or
   imagination. The efficacy of his grace we feel when trouble comes
   actually upon us; many that strengthen others, when it cometh upon them
   faint themselves: Job iv. 4, 5, Thy words have upholden him that is
   falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. But now it is
   come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art
   troubled.' Which showeth that not only the matter of comfort, but the
   effectual blessing cometh from God, or comforting of souls is his work.

   3. That God's comforts are full and strong. For he worketh like
   himself^ and therefore can and will support his people in the greatest
   difficulties. It is sometimes represented as full: Acts xiii. 52, The
   disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost;' and, I am
   filled with comfort, and am exceeding joyful in all our tribulations,'
   2 Cor. vii. 4: huperperisseuomai te chara. And our Lord Jesus, when he
   took care for our comfort, took care for our full comfort: John xv. 11,
   These things have I spoken, that my joy may remain in you, and your joy
   might be full.' Thus we see the joy of believers is a full joy, that no
   other joy needeth to be added to it; it is a full joy to hear us out
   under all discouragements. For what is wanting to them who have God for
   their portion, and the promised glory for their inheritance, and God's
   providence engaged for their protection, safety, and comfort, while
   they are here by the way? And it is strong as well as full: Heb. vi.
   18, That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to
   lie, we might have strong consolation.' Other comforts are weak and of
   little force; they are not affliction-proof, much less are they
   death-proof, and judgment-proof; they cannot stand before a few
   serious, sober thoughts of the world to come. The comforts of the world
   cannot stay and revive the heart; for every blast of a temptation
   scattereth them.

   Use 1. To reprove Christians for their over-much dejection and fainting
   in troubles. Why are we so much cast down? Is there no balm in Gilead,
   nor comfort in God? Why hath God taken the name upon him of being the
   God of all comfort, and put this office upon his Spirit to be the
   comforter? Hath he not made sufficient provision in the new covenant?
   Is there any evil which the promise of eternal life cannot countervail?
   Is God backward to give you comfort? Why, then, did he send Christ,
   write scriptures, appoint a ministry and ordinances, seek to prepare
   you for it by the seal and earnest of his Spirit, and invite you so
   earnestly to trust in him, to cast all your care upon him, and so often
   forbid your fear and sorrow?

   Use 2. If all comfort be of God, let us go to God for it. But then take
   these three directions:--

   1. See you be qualified for it. Comfort follows holiness, as heat doth
   fire: the Spirit is first a sanctifier and then a comforter; and
   according to God's promise, is more necessarily a sanctifier than a
   comforter: Eph. i. 13, 14, In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard
   the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also, after
   that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,
   which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the
   purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.' Comfort is our
   happiness; but we are made holy before happy. Hereafter we enter into
   our master's joy, we have a taste of it in the world. But who have this
   taste but the sanctified and self-denying Christians? The work of
   sanctification is carried on more certainly, but his comforting work is
   many times obscure and interrupted. Do your work thoroughly and
   faithfully, and you may refer yourselves to God for comfort.

   2. Expect not a singular way of comfort besides the word. It was
   Eliphaz's charge upon Job, chap. xv. 11, Are the consolations of God
   small with thee? Is there any secret thing with thee?' The charge is,
   that he undervalued the common consolation of God, and looked for some
   secret way peculiar to himself of getting comfort, besides humbling of
   himself, and turning unto God. No; God hath sufficiently provided for
   the comfort of his people, and we must not expect singular
   manifestations of his love, and special signs and tokens, beyond the
   common allowance given to the whole family. It is a thousand to one but
   it is some false consolation and dream of comfort which they affect and
   cry up, beyond or besides the usual comforts of his word.

   3. Do not compare lower discoveries of God with that great revelation
   he hath made of his mind in the word, for the comfort of his people;
   for this argueth great unthankfulness, and a secret desire to set up
   man's comfort against those which are unquestionably of the Lord. Sure
   it is, that whatever good is in nature, is from God; but it is mingled
   with so many weaknesses, that what is of God can scarce be seen in it.
   I speak of those that cry up heathen philosophy, to the disparagement
   of the word of God, as if it were a better institution to quiet the
   mind, and fortify it against all troubles, than Christianity. But alas!
   they neither know the true ground of misery, which is sin, nor the true
   ground of comfort, which is Christ, And that which mere man offereth
   can neither come with such authority and blessing as what cometh
   immediately from God. This is a moonlight that rotteth things before it
   ripeneth them. In short, philosophers were never acquainted with
   Christ, the foundation of comfort; nor the Spirit, the efficient cause
   of comfort; nor the promise of pardon and life, which is the matter of
   comfort; nor faith, which is the light by which we know things that
   depend upon divine revelation, and so the proper instrument of comfort.
   This I thought good to say, because comfort and rest for souls is one
   of the great benefits of our religion: Jer. vi. 16, Stand in the way
   and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk
   therein; and ye shall find rest for your souls;' Mat. vi. 28, 29, Come
   unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you
   rest.'

   Use 3. Seek it in the use of means and ordinances which God hath
   appointed for the raising of comfort in us, as the word, prayer, and
   the Lord's Supper. In solemn duties God reneweth the pledges of his
   love to us, exciteth grace, and by grace comfort. It must needs be so,
   because then the grounds of comfort are anew laid in the view of
   conscience; graces are in their lively exercise, and God is not wanting
   to his own institution. Take all these three together, and the reverent
   use of the Lord's Supper must needs increase our comfort. The ground of
   comfort is reconciliation with God by Christ, Rom. v. 11, We joy in God
   through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
   atonement.' And here we raise up our faith and love: Cant. i. 4, The
   King hath brought me into his chamber. We will be glad and rejoice in
   thee; we will remember thy love more than wine. The upright love thee.'
   God's ordinances are not empty; there is some participation: 1 Cor. x.
   16, The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the
   blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of
   the body of Christ?'

   Use 4. Consider the ends why God giveth us comfort. It is to fortify us
   against the enemies of our salvation, so far as they are vexing, and
   troubling, and molesting us in the way to heaven. The Spirit hath two
   great offices--to be a sanctifier and comforter; and both serve all the
   needs of Christians. When we are enticed to sin, he helps us as a
   sanctifier; when we are discouraged in God's service, he helps us a
   comforter. And therefore Christians are to consider their condition,
   and what their present state requireth; for God dispenseth his grace
   according to the assaults made upon them by the enemies of their
   salvation. As for instance, our enemies are the devil, the world, and
   the flesh. These we renounced in baptism; and in the progress of
   Christianity, these are those with whom we conflict and must overcome.
   As for instance, the devil is a tempting devil, who seeketh to draw
   away the saints from God, and, by the love of the flesh, to weaken our
   love and obedience to our proper and our rightful Lord. Now what are we
   to do in this case? To beg comfort and peace, that we may not be
   troubled, though we yield unto his temptations? Alas! this were to turn
   the grace of God into wantonness. No; we are to be sober and watchful,'
   1 Peter v. 8--to use all the rules of sobriety and vigilancy, that our
   worldly comforts may not be a snare to us (sobriety is a holy
   moderation in the use of all earthly things: vigilancy is a holy
   diligence and seriousness in the use of means); and also add to both
   the help of the sanctifying Spirit, that we may keep up our love to
   God, and be faithful in our obedience to him. But the devil is not only
   a tempting devil, but a vexing and disquieting devil, who accuseth us
   before God day and night.' Rev. xii. 10, raiseth in us many troublesome
   fears to make our service uncomfortable, and tire us and clog us. What
   is our duty then? To beg the help of the Comforter, not only to show
   love to God, but that we may have some persuasion of his love to us,
   and quench his fiery darts, that we may go on cheerfully in our work,
   because the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.'
   Rom. xvi. 20. So for the world. The world is a tempting world, drawing
   our affections from God and heaven to present things; and when it
   smileth on us, encroaches upon our hearts more and more: 2 Tim. iv. 10,
   Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world.' Now what is
   our business then? To beg comfort and assurance of God's love? No; that
   would be our bane; there is work for the Sanctifier rather than the
   Comforter, that the worldly spirit may be subdued in us; there is need
   of mortification rather than assurance, that we may be crucified to the
   world.' Gal. vi. 14. But sometimes the world is a persecuting world,
   and reproacheth and troubleth us with all manner of vexations; then
   there is work for the Comforter, to seal up to our souls the love of
   God, our interest in Christ: John xvi. 33, These things have I spoken
   to you, that in me ye might have peace; in the world ye shall have
   tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world;' and to
   become to our souls the earnest of eternal glory. Comfort is for
   tribulation; at other times we are glutted with it, but then it is our
   great support. When all things fail, we feel the great necessity of the
   joys of faith. It is good to time well our duties. David saith, Ps.
   lvi. 3, What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.' So for the flesh;
   it enticeth us: James i. 14, Every man is tempted when he is drawn away
   of his own lust and enticed.' Many times it draweth to actual sin by
   indulgence to its desires; yea, disposeth us often to apostasy and
   falseness of heart; for apostasy usually begins at falseness of heart,
   when the fleshly mind and interest is not thoroughly overcome. Well,
   when we are conscious to this, what shall we do in such a case?
   Certainly the great and proper work is to beg the Spirit, and implore
   the Spirit as a sanctifier, and to be more obedient to his sanctifying
   motions. Comfort will come in time. Well, but the flesh is not only
   enticing, but troublesome and grievous to the saints; witness Paul's
   groans: Rom. vii. 24, O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
   from the body of this death?' We are quite wearied and tired out with
   the importunity of its motions; we would serve God more purely and
   perfectly. Then there is work for the Comforter, and confidence in his
   operations to help the faithful soul: Phil. i. 6, Being confident of
   this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will
   perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ.' Then it is seasonable to
   remember the covenant we are under: Rom. vi. 14, For sin shall not have
   dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.' The
   serious, striving soul will not be left destitute. Thus must we expect
   comfort.

   Use 5. Remember that comfort hath a latitude in it, and is expressed by
   divers words.

   1. Sometimes by it support is implied, when the sense of sin and fear
   of God's wrath is not altogether removed and taken away, but so
   mitigated and abated, that hope doth more easily prevail in the soul
   than fear; and we resolve to wait on God, though we cannot so fully
   clear up our interest in him. You have many conflicts and fears, yet
   some hope and expectation towards God: Jonah ii. 4, 5, I am cast out of
   thy sight, yet will I look again to thy holy temple.' Resolute
   adherence giveth great support: Job xiii. 15, Though he slay me, yet
   will I trust in him; I will maintain my own ways before him.' He
   dependeth merely on the covenant.

   2. Peace, or some rest from troubles and accusations of conscience.
   There is some calm and quiet of soul: Rom. v. 1, Being justified by
   faith, we have peace with God;' Gal. vi. 16, As many as walk according
   to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy.' Assaulted with none or
   light fears: John xvi. 33, In me ye shall have peace.' I will give you
   peace, though not full spiritual suavities.

   3. The third word is joy: 1 Peter i. 8, Ye rejoice with joy
   unspeakable, and full of glory.' In peace all things are quiet, they
   have no anxious thoughts; but in joy there is a sensible motion of
   pleasure and delight. They are feasted with the pleasures of faith,
   love, and hope. Let us then bless God for any degree of comfort.

SERMON XVIII.

   And stablish you in every good word and work.--2 Thes. II. 17.

   WE come now to the apostle's second request for them: And stablish you
   in every good word and work.' By every good word' is meant sound
   doctrine; by every good work,' holiness of life.

   Doct. Establishment in faith and holiness is a needful blessing, and
   earnestly to be sought of God.

   1. What this establishment is.

   2. How needful.

   3. Why it is to be sought of God.

   I. What this establishment is? Ans. Confirmation in the grace that we
   have received. Now this confirmation must be distinguished.

   1. With respect to the power wherewith we are assisted; there is
   habitual confirmation, and actual confirmation.

   [1.] The habitual confirmation is when the habits of grace are more
   settled and increased: 1 Peter v. 10, The God of all grace strengthen,
   stablish, settle you.' God hath effectually called and converted them,
   and he beggeth the strengthening of the grace which they had received.
   Now thus we are established, when faith, love and hope are increased in
   us; for these are the principles of all spiritual operations; and when
   they have gotten good strength in us, a Christian is more established.
   (1.) Faith is necessary, for we stand by faith: Rom. xi. 20, Because of
   unbelief they were broken off, but thou standest by faith.' We do not
   only live by it, but stand by it, and are kept by it: 1 Peter i. 5, Who
   are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.' He is
   strong that is strong in faith, as Abraham was, that believeth the
   gospel, and can venture his all upon it, and trust himself in God's
   hands, whatever befalleth him: Luke xxii. 32, I have prayed for thee
   that thy faith fail not.' That was the grace likely to be assaulted,
   and would most keep him; had he been persuaded that Jesus was the Son
   of God, would he have denied him with oaths and execrations? (2.) Love
   is strong. We are told, Cant. viii. 6, 7, That love is as strong as
   death; many waters cannot quench it: if a man would give all the
   substance of his house, it would utterly be contemned.' It will not be
   bribed or quenched. Our backsliding cometh from losing our complacency
   in or desire of God: there is an averseness from sin and zeal against
   it; as long as we have a sense of our obligations to God, and a value
   and esteem of his grace in Christ, then we continue in delightful
   obedience to him, and level and direct our actions to his glory. (3.)
   Hope is necessary to stablish the soul on the promise of eternal life;
   for this is the sure and stedfast anchor of the soul: Heb vi. 19, Which
   hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast.' If hope
   be strong and lively, present things do not greatly move us.

   [2.] Actual establishment, when these habits are fortified and
   quickened by the actual influence of God. As God doth establish by
   these habitual principles, so by the actual motions of his Spirit; for
   otherwise neither the stability of our resolutions nor of gracious
   habits will support us. Not stability of resolutions: Ps. lxxiii. 2, As
   for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well-nigh slipped.' Not
   habit: Rev. iii. 2, Be watchful, and strengthen those things which
   remain, that are ready to die.' It is true, God ordinarily worketh most
   strongly with strongest graces, because their hearts are most prepared;
   yet sometimes weak Christians have gone through great temptations when
   strong ones have failed: Rev. iii. 8, Thou hast a little strength, and
   hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.' Sometimes the strong
   Christian stumbleth and falleth when the weak standeth. God may in an
   instant confirm a weak person in some particular temptation, by his
   free assistance, but ordinarily concurreth with the strongest grace.
   Thus with respect to the power wherewith we are assisted.

   2. With respect to the object or matter about which it is conversant:
   stablished in every good word and work; stability in the doctrine of
   faith and practice of godliness.

   [1.] In the doctrine of faith. It is a great advantage in the spiritual
   life to have a sound judgment. Some men are never well grounded in the
   truth, and in the nature and reasons of that religion which they do
   profess, and then are always left to a wandering uncertainty, because
   they resolve not upon evidence; as men ordinarily abide not in the
   place to which they are driven by a tempest, or the current of the
   tides, rather than by aim and choice, though they take shelter there
   for the present: 1 Thes. v. 21, Prove all things, hold fast that which
   is good.' Certainly religion in the general must be taken up by choice,
   and not by chance; not because we know no other, but because we know no
   better: as Jer. vi. 16, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the
   old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein.' And the same is
   true of particular opinions and controversies about religion, till we
   have i'dion ste'rigma, our own stedfastness,' 2 Peter iii. 17. We stand
   by the stedfastness of others, when we profess the truth merely because
   of company; and when the chain is broken, we all fall to pieces. Now we
   ought to be well settled, lest we appear to the world with a various
   face, which breedeth atheism in others, and shame to ourselves. It is
   possible, in particular things, future light may disprove present
   practice; but then we must be able to give a very sufficient account of
   it. Luther, when he was charged with apostasy, Confitetur se esse
   apostatam, sed beatum et sanctum, qui fidem Diabolo datam non servavit.
   While we cry up constancy, we must not cherish stubborn prejudice,
   which shuts the door upon truth. However, to avoid the opinion of
   lightness, before religious persons profess anything, their warrant
   need to be very clear, both for the world's sake and their own, that
   they may not make needless troubles, and afterwards change their mind,
   to the scandalising of others: and their own sake: dipsuchos aner,
   James i. 8, A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.' And we
   had need to take care to be right, because every error hath an
   influence upon the heart and practice: upon the heart, as it weakeneth
   faith and love; and practice: some opinions have no malignity in
   themselves, yet the profession of them may divide the church, and make
   us by contentions enemies of the growth and progress of Christ's
   kingdom. Now, if we would be established in the truth, we must see what
   influence every truth hath upon the new nature, either as it worketh
   towards God by faith, to keep up our respects to him, or men by love,
   as it furthereth our duties to them. A man will not easily let go truth
   that is wont to turn it into practice, and to live as he believeth.
   Once more, we need to be established in the present truth; it is no
   zeal to fight with ghosts and antiquated errors, but to take God's part
   in our time; but usually the orthodoxy of the world is an age too
   short, men please themselves in things received.

   [2.] In every good work, or in holiness of life. Here needeth the
   greatest establishment, that we may hold on our course to heaven; and
   the usual apostasy and backsliding that men are guilty of is from the
   practice of religion. It is ill when the mind is tainted, but worse
   when the heart is alienated from God; and commonly it is the perverse
   inclination of the will that tainteth the mind. Therefore the great
   establishment is to be settled in a course of godliness: 1 Thes. iii.
   13, That he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before
   God, even our Father, until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
   all his saints.' Now this establishment is very difficult.

   First, Because of the contrariety of the principles that are within us:
   Gal. v. 17, For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
   against the flesh; and these are contrary one to the other, so that ye
   cannot do the things that ye would.' The garrison is not free from
   danger that hath an enemy lodged within. The love of the world and the
   flesh was in the heart before the love of God and holiness, and these
   are not wholly rooted out. Yea, these are natural to us, whereas grace
   is a plant planted in us contrary to nature; and the ground that
   bringeth forth weeds and thistles of its own accord, but the flowers
   and good herbs with much tillage and cultivation, if it be neglected,
   the weeds will soon overgrow the flowers.

   Secondly, Because it is more hard to continue in conversion than to
   convert ourselves at first. In our first conversion we are more
   passive; it is God that converteth us, and draweth us to himself, and
   quickens and plants us into Christ; but in perseverance and fulfilling
   our covenanting duty, we are more active; it is our work, though we
   perform it by God's grace. An infant in the mother's womb is nourished
   by the nourishment of the mother, but afterwards he must suck and seek
   his own nourishment; and the older he groweth, the more care of his
   life is devolved upon himself. Now, that which is more our work is more
   difficult. It is true that God, that hath begun a good work, doth
   perfect it, but not without our care, Phil. i. 6. When we are fitted
   and prepared unto good works, God expecteth from us that we should walk
   in them. God stablisheth us in the text, but it is in every good work.
   Besides, in conversion, we make covenant with God, but by perseverance
   we keep covenant with him. Now it is easier to consent to conditions
   than it is to fulfil them; the ceremonies, at first consent of
   marriage, are not so difficult as to perform the duties of the marriage
   covenant. It is more easy to build a castle in a time of peace than to
   keep it in a time of war. Peter more easily consented to come to Christ
   upon the water; but when he began to try it, his feet were ready to
   sink, Mat. xiv. 29, 30. When winds and waves are against us, alas! how
   soon do we fail! Therefore, a good spring doth not always foreshow a
   fruitful harvest, nor plenty of blossoms store of fruit. We are carried
   on with great life and earnestness for a while in the profession of
   religion, we consent to follow Christ; but when we meet with
   difficulties not foreseen or allowed for, we faint and are discouraged.
   ^

   3. With respect to the subject in which it is seated, which is the soul
   with its faculties. The strength of the body is known by experience
   rather than by description; but the strength of the soul must be
   determined by its right constitution towards good and evil. The
   faculties of the soul are either the understanding, wherein lieth the
   directive counsel, or the will, wherein lieth the imperial power, or
   the affections, wherein lieth the executive power of the soul.

   [1.] The mind or understanding is established when we have a clear,
   certain, and full apprehension of the truth of the gospel; it is called
   knowledge; the sure, and sound, and certain apprehension of them is
   called faith, or intellectual assent, or the full assurance of
   understanding.' Col. ii. 2, when there is a due knowledge of what God
   hath revealed, with a certain persuasion of the truth of it, wrought in
   us by the Holy Spirit. Now, the more clearly, and orderly, and
   certainly we know these things, the more powerfully do they affect the
   heart, and the more we are established. He that hath little knowledge
   and little certainty is called weak in the faith: Rom. xiv. 1, Him that
   is weak in the faith receive, but not to doubtful disputations.' And
   those that have a clearer understanding are called strong; as Rom. xv.
   1, We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak;'
   meaning strong in knowledge. So also for certainty of persuasion, it is
   said, Rom. iv. 20, Abraham was strong in faith, giving glory to God;'
   when in all his trials he bore up himself upon the confidence of God's
   word and promise. Well, then, the mind is confirmed and established
   when we have a good stock of knowledge, and do firmly believe what we
   know of God and Christ and eternal salvation. But alas! how few truths
   do many Christians know, especially in their order, and as to their
   worth, and weight, and certainty, and so that, if we know these things,
   we know them not as we ought to know them: 1 Cor. viii. 2, If any man
   think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to
   know them.' If we know them speculatively, we know them not
   practically. If we are able to discourse of these things, we do not
   live by them. If we know them generally, we do not know them
   particularly, to direct us in all cases wherein they concern us, but
   are blinded with temptations. If we know them comprehensively, so as to
   look about the compass of them, yet not certainly, John xvii. 8, And
   have known surely that I came out from thee--' so as to venture our
   interests upon them. If we know them darkly, and with a half light, we
   do not know them clearly and with a full light. There is many times
   conviction in the ore, which is not refined into a clear and distinct
   knowledge, such as may awe the heart. If we know these things
   habitually, we know them not actually, when we should remember them in
   their season; and oblivion is a sort of ignorance. Hence come the many
   doubts we are assaulted with, and all the unevenness and uncertainty of
   our lives, so that the mind needeth to be established in grace.

   [2.] The will, which is the imperial power of the soul. Now, the will's
   establishment is known by its firm and thorough resolution for God and
   against sin. For God: as Acts xi. 23, Barnabas, when he had seen the
   grace of God, was very glad, and exhorted them all that, with full
   purpose of heart, they would cleave to the Lord.' First choosing, then
   cleaving, and this with full purpose, when the will is so fixed in the
   knowledge and faith of the gospel that they resolve to abide by their
   choice: Ps. xxvii. 4, One thing have I desired of the Lord; this will I
   seek after.' When spiritual resolution carrieth the .force and
   authority of a principle in the soul, and nothing can break it: 1 Peter
   iv. 1 Arm yourselves with the same mind.' As constantly as Christ
   persevered in the work of mediation, so be you in the work of
   obedience, notwithstanding the difficulties of it. This powerful will,
   that beareth down oppositions and temptations, and the greatest
   impediments in the way to heaven, so that you rather make advantage of
   opposition than are discouraged by it, when sensual or carnal good is
   of little force to you, and you can despise the most pleasing baits of
   sin.

   [3.] The affections are the executive power, and do excite and stir us
   up to do what the mind is convinced of and the will resolved upon as to
   the necessary duties of the gospel in order to eternal happiness. There
   is a backwardness within and many temptations without; but a holy
   delight overcometh the unwilling backwardness within, and overbalanceth
   either worldly fear or worldly hope without, that the soul is carried
   on powerfully towards God. We never work better than when we work in
   the strength of some eminent affection, when the heart is enlarged: Ps.
   cxix. 32, I will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt
   enlarge my heart.' Either love or hope. Love filleth us with delight,
   overcoming our natural slackness and sluggishness in the ways of God:
   Ps. xl. 8, I delight to do thy will, my God, yea, thy love is within my
   heart;' 1 John v. 3, For this is the love of God, that we keep his
   commandments, and his commandments are not grievous;' Ps. cxii. 1,
   Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in
   his commandments.' Hope beareth us up in contempt of present delights
   and terrors of sense: Heb. iii. 6, Whose house are we, if we hold fast
   the confidence and rejoicing of hope firm unto the end;' so that we
   serve God with vigour and alacrity. When our affections are damped,
   grace falleth into a consumption; and if you lose your taste, your
   practice will languish, your service of God will not be so uniform. It
   is a great part of our establishment to keep up the vigour and fervency
   of our affections.

   4. With respect to the uses for which it serveth, as to duties,
   sufferings, conflicts.

   ; [1.] Doing the will of God, or discharging our doings with delight,
   cheerfulness, and constancy; for all strength is for work: Eph. iii.
   16, That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, to be
   strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.' That we may do
   our work with that readiness of mind which becomes faith in Christ and
   love to God. This is often spoken of in scripture: Phil, ii. 13, For it
   is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good
   pleasure,' to thelein kai to energein; and Heb. xiii. 21, Make you
   perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you what is well
   pleasing in his sight.' It is of great use to our establishment that
   the soul be kept doing; for as wells are the sweeter for draining, so
   are we the more lively for exercise. Frequent omission of good duties,
   or seldom exercise of grace, necessarily produceth a decay; as a key
   rusteth that is seldom turned in the lock; thereby we lose the life and
   comfort of religion, and at length cast it off as a needless and
   unprofitable thing.

   [2.] For bearing afflictions, and passing through all conditions with
   honour to God and safety to ourselves: Phil. iv. 13, I can do all
   things through Christ, which strengtheneth me;' Col. i. 11,
   Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, with all
   patience.' The great use of establishment is to fortify us against all
   the evils and inconveniences of the present life, that we may hold on
   our course to heaven in fair way or foul, and not be greatly moved by
   anything that befalleth us within time.

   [3.] For conflicts with temptations from the devil, the world, and the
   flesh. The world is round about us, and we are accustomed to these
   inveigling objects whose importunity prevaileth at length. The devil
   seeketh to work upon our affections and inclinations, and the flesh
   urgeth us to gratify them. How, then, is a Christian safe? God
   establisheth him: Eph. vi. 10, Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in
   the power of his might.' A Christian here is in a military state, and
   we of ourselves, left unto ourselves, are like reeds shaken with every
   wind; we have need of establishment in regard of our own feebleness,
   and the force of our enemies. We must be established against the devil
   soliciting; against the world, the silent argument by which he
   soliciteth us and draweth us from God and heaven; against the flesh,
   the rebelling principle which is apt to be wrought upon by Satan. Well,
   then, this establishment is that grace which enableth us to carry on
   the duties of religion with constancy, frequency, and delight; to bear
   all the inconveniences of religion with patience and fortitude; to be
   more deaf and resolute against all the suggestions of the devil, or the
   machinations of the flesh, stirred up by the world.

   5. With respect to the degree, it is such a strengthening of the soul
   as doth prevent not only our fall, but our shaking. Before falling
   away, or our being drawn to apostasy, there may be a shaking, a
   doubtfulness, and wavering of mind with respect to the truth, and much
   inconstancy and unevenness of life with respect to practice. Now,
   Christians, as they must not draw back to perdition, so they must not
   be always fluctuating and unfixed, either in matters of opinion, but
   settled in the truth, or in matters of practice; there must be a
   strength and stability of holy inclinations and resolutions for God and
   the world to come still kept up, or else there will be no evenness or
   uniformity in the course of our lives. And though we avoid apostasy,
   yet we cannot avoid scandal; though there be no falling back, there is
   a stepping out into bypaths: 1 Cor. xv. 58, Be stedfast and unmoveable,
   always abounding in the work of the Lord;' and Eph. iii. 17, That ye
   being rooted and grounded in love,' &c.; and Col. i. 23, If ye continue
   in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope
   of the gospel.' If we do not look to the degree, our weakness and
   instability groweth upon us; as in matters of opinion, some have an
   unsettled head of a vertiginous spirit: Eph. iv. 14, Carried about with
   every wind of doctrine.' They never were well grounded in the truth,
   nor took up the ways they are engaged in upon sufficient evidence; and
   therefore, by their own weakness, and the cunning and diligence of the
   seducers, are drawn into error. Light chaff is blown up and down by
   every wind, when solid grain hitcheth in, and resteth in the floor
   where it is winnowed. A half light maketh us uncertain in our course.
   For matter of practice, if we allow our selves in our first declinings,
   the evil will grow upon us; when the judgment reasoneth more remissly
   against sin than it did before, and the will doth oppose it with less
   resolution, or with greater faintness and indifferency, or when
   opposition doth more discourage us. No; there must be a resolved
   conquest of temptations that would pervert you; this will only serve
   our turn: Heb. xii. 3, Consider him that endured such contradictions,
   lest ye be weary and faint in your minds.' Weariness is a lesser degree
   of deficiency. Many a man is weary that is not faint or quite spent; so
   with the practice of godliness, when the heart begins to be alienated
   and estranged from God, and the life of duty doth decay. When our first
   love is gone, our first works will in a great measure cease: Rev. ii.
   4, 5, Nevertheless I have some thing against thee, because thou hast
   left thy first love. Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen,
   and repent, and do thy first works.' Well, then, the degree must be
   minded; for though a man may be stedfast in the main, yet he may be
   somewhat moved and shaken; but a Christian should not only be stedfast,
   but unmoveable; otherwise we shall be very uncertain in our motions.

   II. How needful it is: this is in a great measure showed already. But
   yet more fully.

   1. Man at best is but a creature. The new creation doth carry a great
   correspondence with the old and first creation. It is not enough that
   the creature be, but he must be sustained in being; we have our being
   in God still: Acts xvii. 28, For in him we live, and move, and have our
   being.' As providence is a continual creation, so stablishing grace is
   the continuance of the new creation. The same grace that sets us in the
   state of the new creation, the same stablisheth us. God found no
   stability in the angels, therefore it is said he trusteth them not: Job
   xv. 15, Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are
   not clean in his sight.' They stand by the grace and favour of God.
   Take the best creatures even as creatures, they are defective and
   unstable in themselves; for God will have the creature, as a creature,
   to be a dependent thing on the Creator, who only is a being of himself.
   Man at his best estate was but an unstable creature--for Adam gave out
   at the first assault--and since, we are very unstable, blown down with
   the blast of every little temptation. Even in the state of grace, we
   are like a glass without a bottom, broken as soon as out of hand; and,
   therefore, God alone is able to make us stand, and persevere in this
   grace that we have received: 2 Cor. i. 21, Now, he that stablisheth us
   with you in Christ is God.' After we are in Christ, our stability is in
   God alone.

   2. The indisposition of our natures both to every good word and work.
   (1.) To every good word. The truths of the gospel are supernatural.
   Now, things that are planted in us contrary to nature can hardly
   subsist and maintain themselves. We have some seeds of the law yet left
   in our hearts, Rom. ii. 14. But the gospel dependeth on sure
   revelation; therefore are there so many heresies against the gospel,
   but none against the law. Therefore, as they depend upon a divine
   revelation, they must be settled in our hearts by a divine power, and
   by a divine power preserved there; that as the doctrine is
   supernatural, so the grace may be also by which we do receive it. Faith
   is the gift of God: Eph. ii. 8, For by grace ye are saved, through
   faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God;' both as to
   its beginning, so to its preservation and increase. (2.) To every good
   work. There is not only slowness and backwardness of heart to the
   duties of the gospel, but somewhat of the old enmity and averseness
   remaineth still. Our hearts are not only inconstant and unsettled, but
   very wayward: Jer. xiv. 10, Thus saith the Lord to this people, Thus
   have they loved to wander;' Ps. xcv. 10, It is a people that do err in
   their heart.' Moses was no sooner gone aside with God in the mount, but
   the Israelites, after their solemn covenant, fell to idolatry. Before
   the law could be written, they brake it. Now, we that have a warring
   principle within, how can we stand unless God establish us? There is a
   back-bias, there are the seeds of wantonness, anger, revenge, envy,
   impatience, worldliness, ambition, and sensuality. God knoweth how
   little the fleshly mind and interest is conquered in us; and therefore,
   if he did not establish us, we should soon show ourselves.

   3. In regard of those oppositions that are made against us after once
   we be in Christ. It is not enough that we are brought out of the
   kingdom of Satan, but after we are rescued out of his hand and power,
   he pursueth us with continual malice; therefore there must be the same
   power to stablish us still in grace that first brought us into the
   state of grace: Col. i. 13, Who has delivered us from the power of
   darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son;'
   compared with 1 John iv. 4, Ye are of God, little children, and have
   overcome them; because greater is he that is in you than he that is in
   the world.' The world runneth a quite contrary course than those do
   that set their faces heavenward, and therefore maligns them, and
   pursues them with reproaches and troubles: 1 Peter iv. 4, 5, Wherein
   they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of
   riot, speaking evil of you; who shall give account to him that is ready
   to judge the quick and the dead.' And most commonly our supports are
   invisible, and we have no temporal interest to leant to; but, 2 Tim. i.
   12, For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am
   not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded he is
   able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.' We
   bear these afflictions by the power of God.

   4. We see here the saints miscarry when God withdraweth his supporting
   grace but in part, as Peter, David. Peter was in the state of grace,
   and Christ prayed that his faith might not utterly fail; yet, when God
   did not establish him, you see what sins he was guilty of in that
   combat. David was a man after God's own heart;' but how did he fall
   when God upheld him not! Ps. li. Hezekiah; 2 Chron. xxxii. 31, Howbeit
   in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent
   unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left
   him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.' Thus is
   God fain to humble his children, to teach them dependence, and to put
   them in mind that they do not stand by their own strength..

   III. Why it is to be sought of God?

   1. He only is able: Rom. xvi. 25, Now to him that is of power to
   establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus
   Christ,' &c. Surely God never made a creature too hard for himself. He
   is able to defeat the power of enemies, and to preserve his people in
   the midst of temptations. So Jude, ver. 24, To him that is able to keep
   you from falling,' &c.; and He is able to keep that which I have
   committed to him,' 2 Tim. i. 12. The saints gather much comfort from
   this, for it is a relief to their thoughts against the dreadful and
   powerful opposition of the world; they have no reason to doubt of their
   Father's love. That which surpriseth them is to see all the world
   against them. It is the dreadfulness of power in the temptation and
   sense of their own weakness; therefore the power of God is a fit relief
   to them.

   2. God is not very forward to cast you off, when he hath a just cause
   to do it. Your constant experience evidenceth this. If he here had done
   so, what had become of you long ago? For you have given him abundant
   occasion, you have weaned him with your sins, abused his mercies; and
   yet he hath not cast you off. He hath not utterly forsaken you, when
   you have turned the back upon him and have been ready to forsake him,
   but hath kept you from dangers and in dangers; yea, called you to his
   grace, confirmed you hitherto. Why should you doubt of his grace for
   the future? 2 Cor. i. 10, Who delivered us from so great a death, and
   doth deliver; in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;' 2 Tim. iv.
   17, 18, Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me;
   that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the
   Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
   And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve
   me unto his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for ever and ever.
   Amen.'

   3. He hath made promises of sustentation and preservation: Ps. lxxiii.
   23, Nevertheless I am continually with thee; thou hast holden me by my
   right hand.' Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for God
   upholdeth him with his hand. If God hath promised to preserve that
   grace which he hath once given, should not we pray for the continuance
   of it with the more encouragement?

   4. The experience of the saints: Ps. xciv. 18, When I said my foot
   slippeth, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.' God's manutenancy is there
   asserted.

   Use. Is to press us at all times to look up to God for establishment;
   but especially in two seasons:--

   1. When we begin to decline, and grow more remiss and indifferent in
   the practice of godliness. If grace be weak, you must get it
   strengthened. When you grow bolder in sin, and more strange to God and
   Jesus Christ, and have little converse with him in the Spirit, oh! it
   is time to be instant and earnest with God, that he would recover you.
   Though you have embezzled your strength, yet you have to do with a
   merciful God; go to him for help: Ps. xvii. 5, Hold up my goings in thy
   path, that my footsteps slip not.' You have forfeited the more
   plentiful aids of grace; but beg him not to forsake you utterly. You
   must confess the sin, but God must remedy the evil: Ps. cxix. 133,
   Order my steps in thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over
   me.' Lord, I am apt to be led away with worldly allurements; my
   spiritual taste is distempered with carnal vanities: but, let not
   iniquity have dominion over me.'

   2. In unsettled times, when we are full of fears, and think we shall
   never hold out in a holy course. God, that keepeth us in times of
   peace, will hold us up in times of trouble: Ps. xvi. 8, I have set the
   Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be
   moved.'

                             A PRACTICAL EXPOSITION

    UPON THE

FIFTY-THIRD CHAPTER OF ISAIAH.
     __________________________________________________________________

TO THE READER

   THE character of Dr Manton is so generally known by his celebrated
   preaching so many years in this city, and by the numerous collections
   of excellent discourses published since his death, that I cannot think
   it needful to give any account of him here, as I do not pretend to add
   anything to the accounts already given by those excellent persons that
   published his former works. It will be sufficient to remark, that his
   works have been esteemed by some of the best judges one of the most
   valuable collections of scriptural and practical divinity, and to have
   been as generally serviceable to the world as most that have appeared
   in these latter ages, and in many respects no way inferior to some of
   the ancient monuments of the Christian church.

   I shall reckon myself concerned only to give some account of this
   treatise.

   As to the subject of it, I shall only observe, that as the prophecy of
   Isaiah contains the clearest revelations of the Messiah, and is writ in
   the loftiest style of any part of the Old Testament, so this excellent
   chapter is an eminent instance of both, containing an exact description
   both of his sufferings and his glories, represented in bright and
   lively colours, and in a phrase, though somewhat difficult and obscure,
   exceeding lofty and sublime. The veil of the temple seemed to have been
   drawn aside, though not yet rent asunder, and the light of the gospel
   shone forth with a brighter glory than ever it had appeared before.
   Upon those accounts this chapter has exercised the thoughts and
   employed the diligence of several eminent persons in former and later
   times; though, through some or other misfortune, they have been buried
   with their authors, and have never seen the light. Perhaps this is the
   only thing that can pretend to a just discourse now extant.

   It would not be proper, in the preface to a practical discourse, to
   undertake the defence of this chapter, and to rescue it from the
   violence offered it in the posthumous annotations of a learned critic,
   who, with a great deal of force, and frequent absurdity, has applied
   this whole chapter to the prophet Jeremiah; not only cross to the
   brightest evidence of truth, and the general consent of Christian
   interpreters, but in flat contradiction to himself in two very accurate
   and elaborate treatises published by himself,--in the one [6] of which,
   arguing against the Jews, he has these remarkable words, That the
   Messiah was to pass through sufferings and death in the way to his
   kingdom, and in order to bestow invaluable blessings on his seed, there
   is no man can doubt that carefully considers Isaiah liii.' And
   afterwards he adds, To whom of all the kings and prophets can this
   agree? To none.' In the other [7] he settles the true sense of the e,
   and exposes the perverse glosses of Socinus.

   As to these discourses themselves, they bear the lively signatures of
   the excellent author, and are of a piece with the rest of his works.
   There is a judicious choice of pertinent matter, disposed in a regular
   method, expressed in a plain and native elegance, quickened and
   enlivened with proper images, and tinctured throughout with a deep
   savour of true piety. And though they may be thought neither so
   polished nor correct as his riper years and his last hand could easily
   have made them, or as were necessary to gratify the nice and the
   curious; yet they seem, however, excellently fitted to a better
   end,--to promote saving knowledge and real godliness, to move and to
   instruct the mind, and give entertainment as well as profit to the
   serious and the wise, and are particularly suitable to sacramental
   occasions.

   It will be only further necessary to acquaint the reader that, as these
   sermons were preached in his stated and ordinary course, so they were
   preached in his early youth, and are younger than any of those that
   have seen the light; which must be his apology to the world if any
   expressions are found up and down less accurate and clear, or any thing
   different from what was known to be his sense in some of his later
   writings.

   This account may be collected from the preface of his Exposition on
   James:--

   I have the rather chosen this scripture, that it may be an allay to
   those comforts which in another exercise I have endeavoured to draw out
   of Isaiah liii. I would at the same time carry on the doctrine of faith
   and manners, and show you your duties together with your
   encouragements, lest, with Ephraim, you should only love to tread out
   the corn, and refuse to break the clods. We are all apt to divorce
   comfort from duty, and content ourselves with a barren and unfruitful
   knowledge of Jesus Christ; as if all he required of the world were only
   a few naked, cold, inactive apprehensions of his merit, and all things
   were so done for us that nothing remained to be done by us. This is the
   wretched conceit of many in the present age; and therefore they either
   abuse the sweetness of grace to looseness, or the power of it to
   laziness. Christ's merit, and the Spirit's efficacy are the common
   places from whence they draw all the defences and excuses of their own
   wantonness and idleness.'

   I have compared the transcript with the original notes, and find
   reason, after all the care that has been taken, to beg the reader's
   candour and excuse for any smaller errors that may have escaped, both
   of the copy and of the press.

                            A PRACTICAL EXPOSITION.

   Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord
   revealed?--Isa. LIII. 1.

   I SHALL in the course of this exercise go over the several verses of
   this chapter, which is an eminent portion of scripture, and calls for
   most serious attention. It may rather be called the gospel than the
   prophecy of Isaiah. It contains so ample and clear a discovery of Jesus
   Christ, that one would rather account it historical than prophetical.
   Other prophecies are explained by the history of Christ in the New
   Testament, but this prophecy explains the history; there is no chapter
   so often quoted and vouched by Christ and the apostles as this, viz.,
   no less than seven or eight times in the New Testament. It is so full
   and clear, that it rather needs meditation than a comment, faith more
   than learning, to conceive of it. The coherence or connection of this
   with the former chapter, take briefly thus:--

   The evangelical prophet (for so he may justly be called) had in the end
   of the former chapter spoken of the glory of Christ's kingdom, how
   readily it should be entertained among the Gentiles, how he should
   sprinkle many nations,' and make kings to shut their mouths,' that is,
   with silence hearken to and consider his doctrine. Here, coming to the
   Jews, he finds, on the contrary, nothing but contempt and scorn, and
   therefore in an holy admiration cries out, Who hath believed our
   report?' He saw it was not believed in his days, and that it would not
   in after days. It was in vain to speak to them of the Messiah. In this
   chapter there are three remarkable parts:--

   1. A description of the Jews' horrid unbelief and contumacy against
   Christ, ver. 1.

   2. The occasion and ground of that unbelief, viz., Christ's meanness as
   to outward show and appearance, from ver. 2 to 10.

   3. The removal of this occasion, and taking off this scandal and
   prejudice, by showing the fruit and glory that followed this meanness,
   ver. 11 to the end of the chapter.

   Our text is the first of these, containing a pathetical description of
   the Jews' contempt and rejection of Christ. It is propounded by way of
   query, in two questions.

   1st. The one holds forth the thing or evil itself by way of admiration:
   Who hath believed our report?'

   2dly. The other, the cause of it: To whom is the arm of the Lord
   revealed?'

   1st. In the first there is considerable: the person, who; the act,
   believed; the object, report.

   That the words are a question is clear, but what kind of question is
   not so clear. Some understand the words as a commiseration of the
   prophet: q.d., I am to tell you such things of the sufferings of the
   Messiah, that you will scarce believe men should be so barbarous toward
   him. But this is so absurd that it needs no confutation. It is not a
   question of commiseration, but of admiration, or rather of complaint,
   in which Isaiah applies himself to God, as the Septuagint shows by
   putting in the word Ku'rie, Lord, being herein followed by St Paul,
   Rom. x. 16, For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?' So
   John xii. 38, it is also said, Lord, who hath believed our report?'

   But let us come to the parts of it. Who? Though the inquiry be general,
   it is not to intimate that none, but only that very few did believe, or
   think there was any truth in what was spoken. Then for the object, our
   report, understand it concerning Christ; or, as the LXX. express it, te
   ako?e emon, our hearing,' that is, what they hear from us. The Jews are
   guilty here of a double lie in wresting this place; they say it means
   the report concerning their own misery and succeeding glory, as if
   Israel were spoken of here under the notion of one common person; and
   they transfer the evil complained of from themselves to the Gentiles.
   But the sense is this: There are very few that will hearken to those
   things that we are to tell them concerning the Messiah; they will seem
   riddles and contradictions to them, that there should be such glory in
   things so vile and ignoble to outward appearance.

   2dly. For the reason: To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?' As if
   the prophet had said, Therefore they do not believe, because the arm of
   the Lord is not revealed. Here is some difficulty about what is meant
   by the arm of the Lord,' which, without question, is metaphorical. Some
   take it for the counsel and contrivance of God effected and brought to
   pass; as Acts iv. 28, Whatsoever thy hand (or arm) and counsel
   determined to be done.' It is more properly taken for the strength of
   God: you know the arm is the chiefest receptacle of strength. But what
   strength of God? Some understand it of the gospel, which is called the
   power of God to salvation.' Rom. i. 16; the gospel is not revealed to
   them. So 1 Cor. i. 18, The preaching of the cross is called the power
   of God,' because of that admirable virtue and success which accompanied
   the preaching of it. Some by the power of God understand the power of
   God with Christ. He did miracles, and yet they would not see the arm of
   the Lord. They thought he cast out devils by Beelzebub, as if it were
   by the power of Satan, not of God. Some by arm' understand Christ
   himself, who, 1 Cor. i. 24, is called the power and wisdom of God,' he
   is the power, the arm, the right hand of the Father. There is no great
   work of God but is done in and by Christ, as a man doth his work by his
   arm; as in making the world, vanquishing his enemies, delivering his
   church, it is everywhere spoken of as done by Christ. Others by arm'
   understand the power of the Spirit in and by the ordinances. I rather
   prefer that of the gospel, together with the Spirit.

   Then for revealed, you will say the gospel was revealed to the Jews. I
   answer--There is a double revelation. First, Common, which is nothing
   else but the promulgation of the gospel; this must be to every
   creature. Secondly, Proper and special, to the elect, by the Spirit.
   There is the Spirit's revelation, and the prophet's revelation. The
   meaning is: To whom hath the Spirit of God revealed that what I speak
   is true? To whom is the power of God to salvation inwardly manifested
   and made known by the Spirit? Implying they will not believe without
   this manifestation.

   Thus you have the meaning of the words. I shall offer to your thoughts
   some occasional observations before I come to the main points.

   From the Jews wresting this text, observe:--

   1. That there is an evil disposition in men to turn off upon others
   that which nearly concerns themselves. Men are good at making false
   applications, and turn off that to others which the word and Spirit
   intend to them. When Christ had spoken to Peter, it is said, Peter,
   turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to Jesus,
   Lord, What shall this man do?'

   2. Observe, that it is no new thing in persons to vouch that for
   themselves which makes most against them. Thus the Jews do this chapter
   against the Gentiles. So that which you find written, 1 Cor. xiv. 16,
   How shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen?' the
   papists vouch it for Latin service, though it is the drift of the
   apostle to condemn it. Let not the like usage in our time amaze you,
   when Antinomians and Socinians urge those texts for them that are
   really against them.

   3. Observe this too: When God, for the wickedness of a people,
   hardeneth their hearts, they are apt to mistake in that which is most
   plain. A man would think that this chapter should work upon a Jew if
   anything could; so you wonder why men are not wrought upon by such
   powerful persuasions which speak very home to them. The reason is, God
   hath hardened them, Rom. xi. 7.

   4. From the prophet's great admiration, observe, that when we can do no
   good upon a people, the most effectual way is to complain of it to God.
   He can help us and them too; this will stop murmuring. The mind is
   eased of that burden that lies heavy on us, when we can go and report
   the case to God, and pour out our complaints into his bosom. Other of
   God's messengers besides Isaiah have great cause to say, Who hath
   believed our report?'

   5. Observe, that those that profess the name of God may be much
   prejudiced against the entertainment of those truths and counsels that
   he makes known to them for their good.

   6. That it is a wonder they should not believe so plain a discovery of
   Christ, though by the just judgment of God they did not.

   7. That the first believing of Christ is a believing the report of him;
   but afterwards there are experiences to confirm our belief. The soul
   then knoweth that there is a Christ, and that there is mercy in him: 1
   Peter ii. 3, If so be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious;'
   John iv. 42, Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we have
   heard him ourselves, and know indeed that he is the Christ, the Saviour
   of the world.'

   I come now to the main points which I shall prosecute.

   First, That there may be a glorious report of Jesus Christ, and yet few
   believe it. Or--

   That Jesus Christ may be clearly represented to a people, and yet but
   few won to believe in him.

   Secondly, That the gospel is the arm and power of God, or word of
   righteousness. Though it is an uncredited report to the world, yet it
   is the arm and power of God to them that believe.

   Thirdly, Therefore so few believe, because God's arm is not revealed to
   them: the power of the word is not manifested by the Spirit.

   I. As to the first of these points, other truths may be delivered and
   not closed with, but it is a wonder that so sweet a truth as this
   should not be received. The wonder is so much the greater if we look
   upon:--

   1. The persons making this report: The prophets of old time, the
   apostles in Christ's time, the ministers of the gospel now-a-days--men
   that, if you look upon them singly, did deserve some reverence and
   esteem men--that gave forth abundant declarations that God was with
   them, and spoke by them, who were as polished shafts in God's quiver.
   Then consider them speaking the same thing, all proclaiming the same
   Christ; that is more. For I conceive there is an emphasis in this our
   report--not my, but our; or, as Zachariah, John's father, said, Luke i.
   70, As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been
   since the world began.' Though there were many holy prophets, yet they
   had but one mouth, they spake as if with one mouth: Who hath believed
   our report?'

   2. The persons to whom the report is made: A professing people, a
   people that were nurtured and taught this from their infancy and youth,
   by all the ceremonies of their religion, leading them to that Christ
   whom the prophets did more distinctly reveal to them. They had been
   tutored and taught this lesson for many hundred years by the pedagogy
   of the law; for so that place is to be expounded, Gal. iii. 24, The law
   was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified
   by faith.' The ceremonial law may properly be called paida'gogos eis
   Chri'ston, or the dispensation of Moses. Yet who hath believed our
   report?'

   3. The manner how it is reported: Distinctly, plainly, though in
   prophetical expressions, by Isaiah and Jeremiah, God gave some
   praeludia; some clear expressions were then used by all the prophets.
   Though they had not noonshine, they had the dawning of the day, light
   enough to see the day approaching. Had it been such a dark intimation
   as that of the seed of the woman breaking the serpent's head, it had
   been the less wonder if they had not weighed it, because they could not
   so distinctly have conceived it. But when all is made so clear, the
   wonder is the greater that they should not consider it.

   I shall prove the point by distinguishing the several times in which
   there have been any glorious discovery of Jesus Christ, and show you
   that in all these times the company of believers have been few.
   Distinque tempora, et exis bonus theologus The way to understand the
   reason of it, is to find out what have been the main prejudices against
   Christ in the several times of his revelation. I shall name four
   times:--(1.) The prophets' time; (2.) John Baptist's time; (3.) That of
   Christ's life; (4.) Our time, or the time of the first promulgation of
   the gospel.

   1. The prophets' time, when the number of believers was few. They had
   all some loose and general expectation of a Messiah, but few believed,
   at least not in such a Messiah as the prophet prophesied of.

   [1.] Because of the grossness of their hearts, which rested in the
   outward ceremonies, as if they were ordained for themselves, and not to
   signify any other thing. They were observant of the ceremonies, but did
   not observe the end and purpose of them. Therefore doth God so often
   protest against sacrifices. A sacrifice was not acceptable to God but
   according as they did eye Christ in it. Now they used no farther reach
   or recollection, but rested in the sacrifices; as Isa. lxvi. 3, He that
   killeth an ox is as if he slew a man.' And therefore did God so often
   tell them that the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to him.'

   [2.] Because of their want of due observation how God did fulfil his
   promise concerning the Messiah, few troubled themselves about it. Only
   the pious Jews lived in a continual expectation of it, and their hearts
   were always upon the wing of strong and earnest desires after it. It is
   said, Luke ii. 25, Simeon waited for the consolation of Israel.' He was
   a man whose thoughts ran that way. So Daniel, chap. ix. 2, sought by
   books;' then, ver. 21, an angel tells him the time of the Messiah. But
   others were negligent.

   [3.] Their obstinate hatred against the prophets that revealed these
   things concerning Christ. They reproved their other sins, and therefore
   they believed them not in this: Jer. v. 13, The prophets shall become
   wind, and the word of the Lord is not in them.' Disaffection is the
   great prejudice against anything. They judged it false or to no purpose
   before it was spoken. The Jews, though they honoured the prophets when
   dead, could not endure them whilst living: Mat. xxiii. 29, 30, Woe unto
   you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of
   the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, and say, If
   we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been
   partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.' But that was a
   deceit, as I shall show you by and by. These three I conceive to be the
   causes why, in the prophets' time, they did not believe; they are to be
   marked by us, because there is somewhat in them suitable to the case of
   gospel unbelievers, viz., a circle and track of cold duties; a
   non-attendance on God in his ordinances; and a wicked spirit of
   contradiction against his word.

   2. John Baptist's time. I distinguish this from the former, because
   Christ doth so, Mat. xi. 11, Among them that are born of women there
   hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; and yet he that is
   least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.' And Christ saith
   that he is more than a prophet.' He made a more glorious report of
   Jesus Christ, as being immediately to come; and then a common rumour
   was given forth that the Messiah's time was come. Now what were the
   prejudices then?

   [1.] The levity and rashness of the people. If any man were more
   eminent than other, they presently cried him up for the Messiah, and
   therefore, being disappointed in some, they were prejudiced against
   all: Luke iii. 15, And as the people were in expectation, and all men
   mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ or no; John
   answered them, There cometh one after me who is mightier than I.' He
   plainly directeth them to another. Multitudes flocked to him indeed,
   but it was out of a nice and vain curiosity. Few believed his report.

   [2.] The evil influence of the scribes and pharisees, who thought all
   the water lost that went beside their own mill. They would fain keep
   the people under their beck and pleasure, and therefore had a vigilant
   eye upon every new way, or anything that might seem to take off from
   that respect and devotion wherewith the people were engaged to them.
   By-ends in some that should have been teachers, have been always a
   hindrance to the entertainment of Christ. Those that preached Christ
   for their own ends were enemies to the cross of Christ, Phil. iii. 19.

   [3.] Offence at John's boldness. His office was to humble and change
   proud hearts, and he goeth about his work vigorously, therefore they
   forsook him. I shall speak no more of this, because it will fall in
   with the next head.

   3. As to the time of Christ's being in the flesh. There were divers
   prejudices concerning him, both in the Jews and in the Gentiles.

   First, In the Jews. I will name the chief.

   [1.] An erroneous opinion of the Messiah. The people thought he would
   set up an earthly kingdom; they were weary of the Roman yoke, and
   expected that he would free them from it. See an excellent place for
   this, John vi. 14, 15, When the men had seen his miracles, they said,
   This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. And
   when Jesus saw that by force they would come and make him king, he
   departed into a mountain alone.' They conceived he was able to gratify
   their malice on their enemies, out of a hope, conceived from his
   miracles, that he could maintain an army with very little cost. But
   Christ would not hold by that tenure. He would be king of their hearts,
   not of their lands. And therefore, being disappointed, they rejected
   him. There is nothing prejudiceth a man more against a thing than a
   false conceit of it. When we expect what we do not find in it, we
   loathe it. The apostle calleth this knowing Christ after the flesh,' in
   a pompous carnal way. This is to be noted, because we have such gross
   conceits in our hearts, We expect Christ should serve us in our own
   ends, as St Austin speaketh of those conceits he had of God when he was
   a child--Sentiebam te esse magnum aliquem qui potes exaudire et
   subvenire nos; et rogabam te parvus, non parvo affectu, ne in schola
   vapularem. Such childish conceits have some entertained of Christ, they
   could close with him to serve their covetousness, revenge, or
   vain-glory. They look upon him as some great thing that should help
   them.

   [2.] A fond reverence of Moses and the prophets, as if it were
   derogatory to them to close with Christ: John ix. 29, We are Moses'
   disciples; as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.' This
   Christ confutes, John v. 46, If ye had believed Moses, ye would have
   believed me.'

   [3.] Offence at his outward meanness (that is the scope of this chap
   ter), and the persecution he met with; the just judgment of God upon
   them to fit them for destruction. Thus much for the Jews.

   Secondly, As to the Gentiles, there were divers prejudices why they
   would not believe the gospel when tendered to them.

   [1.] Pride in the understanding. They were loth to captivate their
   knowledge to the obedience of Christ, and to make their principles of
   reason strike sail to the truth represented. Therefore, 1 Cor. i. 23,
   it is said, Christ crucified' was to the Greeks foolishness.' It was a
   foolish doctrine, because contrary to their forestalled principles.
   This is to be noted by us also, because we are very unwilling to
   receive anything but what cometh dyed in the colour of our own
   conceits, and is suitable to our carnal minds.

   [2.] The meanness of the reporters, poor fishermen; though sufficient
   enough for the matter they took in hand by the Spirit's mighty
   assistance, yet of no great repute and value in the world. God would
   have the gospel commend itself to have a respect without the addition
   of any outward excellency, and therefore he useth the ministry of mean
   and weak men: Ps. viii. 6, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou
   hast ordained strength.' God knoweth how prone the world is to close
   with a truth upon a preposterous ground, not for its own sake; we
   cannot endure to stoop to a mean man. That of Salvian is very true:
   Omnia dicta tanti existimantur quantus est ipse qui dixit, nec tam
   dictionis vim respiciunt quam dictatoris dignitatem. Men look to the
   worth of the speaker. Any attempt at innovation or alteration must
   needs be ill taken from them who are in the eye of the world very mean
   and low, especially against such practices as have been authorised by
   men of gravity and great judgment, countenanced by antiquity and long
   custom, confirmed by the joint consent of all; for men to quit such
   practices upon the intimation of persons of mean presence and estates,
   it must needs be a great prejudice. As it is said, Paul's bodily
   presence was base and contemptible among them, 2 Cor. x. 10. Therefore,
   having so many lets in the way, well might the prophet cry out Who hath
   believed our report?' It is good to observe this, because this is a
   great prejudice against the entertaining of many of the truths of
   Christ in our days: we have men's persons in disesteem and contempt.

   [3.] The hard conditions upon which they were to entertain Christ. He
   was not, as other of their gods, to be worshipped in company; he was to
   be worshipped alone: they were to forsake all their old ways and
   worship, and to abridge themselves of their unlawful gains and trades;
   and this was a prejudice they could not brook: Acts xix. 27, If this
   doctrine go on, our craft is in danger to be set at nought.' They were
   to expose themselves to all the obloquy and scorn that could be. It was
   crime enough to say they were Christians--Vir bonus nisi quod
   Christianus. They were to be cast upon the disadvantage of the hatred
   of near friends, upon all manner of persecution and cruelty, to be led
   about the cities and amphitheatres as the objects of public scorn and
   malice,--nay, and these things were not to be hidden from them, and
   only the lighter and better part revealed to them,--if they would be
   Christ's disciples. This is a prejudice enough, you will say, against a
   new way,--enough to make the world look upon it as some odd, humorous
   conceit of a few brain-sick persons, who had no other bait to allure to
   their way but fire and faggot, whips and scourges; for the present they
   would promise you nothing but these things. Well might they cry out,
   Who will believe our report? God would have no outward blandishment at
   first, that the truths of religion might not be suspected; and indeed
   hence did so few believe, insomuch that the cause of Christianity never
   came to an indifferent hearing; they hated the name, and would not let
   it plead for itself. Thus for the Gentiles.

   4. I come now to prove it in our times, or the time of the first
   promulgation of the gospel. I might divide my discourse into these two
   heads: Few believe the report of Christ, and few believe in Christ. I
   prove the latter. We all profess ourselves Christians, disciples of
   Christ, those that have entertained him,--but few do really believe.
   The lets and hindrances now are these:--

   [1.] Ignorance. Men hear of Christ, but are not acquainted with him;
   many come to the ordinances, but only to sit out the hour, not to grow
   in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. There is much in a man's ends why he
   cometh to the ordinances: God seldom meets with a man in his word that
   cometh to it with a vain end; if they do not seek after knowledge they
   shall not find it. Many of the reports of Jesus Christ are lost upon an
   ignorant people; they hear the name, and do not weigh the thing in
   their thoughts; they look upon him as aliquem magnum--as some great
   person that the preachers talk of, and go no further. Thousands are
   damned this way through their ignorance they do not trouble their
   thoughts about getting the knowledge of Christ in his word, they come
   to the church and rest in that. There must be distinct apprehensions of
   the report of Christ before faith, not only to hear the sound, but
   weigh the sense: Rom. x. 14, How shall they believe in him of whom they
   have not heard?' that is, not only the sound of his name, but heard so
   as to weigh the doctrine that was delivered concerning him. This
   affected ignorance is a great hindrance when men do not apply
   themselves to knowledge; as it is, Prov. ii. 2, 3, Incline thine ear to
   wisdom, and apply thy heart to understanding: yea, if thou criest for
   knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding.' Many incline
   their ears, but they do not apply their hearts to knowledge, weigh and
   ponder what they hear; if they attend to it while it is spoken, they do
   not consider it afterwards in their more serious thoughts, and ponder
   it in their minds; and therefore no wonder they do not close with
   Christ: Rom. iii. 11, There is none that understandeth, none that
   seeketh after God.' That will necessarily follow, if they do not
   understand Christ, they will not seek after him; a man will not value
   an unknown good. This is one hindrance, gross and affected ignorance.

   [2.] An easy slightness; men do not labour after faith. It is true our
   diligence alone can never attain it, but yet we should use the means.
   Men marry to beget children, yet it is impossible they should generate
   a rational soul without the concourse of God. So we should do those
   things that are likely, and leave the success to God: we should seek
   after it. God will not violently withhold faith from those that are
   diligent, that are much in meditation, much in earnest supplication,
   much in observation, much in a continual and holy expectation, when
   Jesus Christ will be begotten in their souls. God will not fail such a
   waiting soul: Ps. cxxx. 6, My soul waiteth for God more than they that
   watch for the morning; yea, more than they that watch for the morning.'
   Such souls as are thus eager in the pursuit, and earnest in their
   expectation, that would fain have Christ come and appear in their
   hearts, may well expect God's blessing. But there is a great deal of
   idle and easy tightness in men's hearts; they complain for want of
   faith, yet they will not pray, meditate, hear, read; as if God should
   infuse it into them in their sleep. It were an easy cut to heaven if
   God should do all. What need had Christ to tell you, Strait is the
   way'? And faith is called a work, not in regard of the toil of it, but
   in regard of our diligence and intention of spirit. This is the work of
   God, that ye should believe in him whom he hath sent.' It is a sign
   people do not prize a thing when they do not labour after it. If men
   thought Christ worthy of respect, they would not sit still, but take
   pains in the seeking of him. The idle and evil servant are joined
   together: Mat. xxv. 26, Thou wicked and slothful servant!' The wicked
   will be slothful; and as idleness and sin are joined together, so
   idleness and destruction: Prov. i. 32, Ease slayeth the fool,' so it is
   in the margin, or, The turning away of the simple shall slay them.' Men
   perish by resting in their slight wishes; they would have Christ, but
   they would not take the pains to get him. Certainly a man valueth the
   report of Christ at a low rate when he doth not think it worthy of a
   few thoughts, and a little time to consider it. You know what Christ
   saith, Mat. xi. 12, From the days of John the Baptist until now, the
   kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by
   force.' They close with the gospel, which is called the kingdom of God
   there, that pursue it with a great deal of earnestness and fervour of
   spirit. This is the next hindrance, an easy slightness.

   [3.] A careless security. They are not won to believe in Christ,
   because they think themselves well enough without him. Most cannot
   endure to look beyond their present condition. A false heart is so far
   from knowing the worst of its own condition, that it will not so much
   as suppose a time will come in which it may be miserable. Oh! think
   upon changes; rouse up your souls with the sense of your danger! If you
   lull your souls asleep, you may awake in flames; even the gospel is
   peremptory in this kind: Mark xvi. 16, He that believeth not shall be
   damned.' It will not be always with you as now. Oh! cry out, then, Do I
   believe? If men would not put away all thoughts of their eternal
   condition, they would see a greater need of Christ than now they do.
   What a strange thing is it to keep the thoughts of that from our heart,
   which we cannot possibly deliver our souls from hereafter, to wit,
   endless eternity!--to be witty to deceive our own souls, to invent
   shifts that we may put far away the evil day! A man doth not care for
   things till he wanteth them, no, not for the best things, the comforts
   of Christ, the joys of the Spirit. While we have outward comforts we
   care not for inward, because we have a false conceit that our comforts
   will still continue with us: Luke xii. 19, Soul, thou hast much goods
   laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.' He
   would not so much as suppose they might be taken from him that night. A
   man's peace may be tried by this. Secure hearts cannot endure to think
   of danger. Though believers think of danger, yet they think more of
   Christ. They consider their misery, and so are directed to a remedy
   against it. Others, though they cannot put away the evil day, they put
   it out of their thoughts, and labour to make the most of the world they
   can. Briefly, that security is a hindrance is plain, because the number
   of believers is increased by those that have least to trust to in the
   world, and so are necessarily engaged to a consideration of their
   misery, and a want of something that may stand them in stead at the end
   of their days: James ii. 5, Hath God not chosen the poor of this world
   to be rich in faith?' And yet the poor may be secure; they have their
   pleasures and vain thoughts to make them forget their sorrows.

   [4.] A light esteem of Christ. As we do not see our own needs, so not
   his worth. As the heart is, so it judgeth. A carnal heart valueth all
   things by outward pomp and splendour. Such objects take as are most
   excellent in the eyes of the world: Ps. cxliv. 15, Happy is the people
   that is in such a case; yea, happy is the people whose God is the
   Lord.' A man's temper may be discerned by his valuation of things;
   carnal hearts cannot prize spiritual mercies. We prize those things
   that are most suitable to our desires: 1 Peter ii. 7, To them that
   believe Christ is precious.' He is an honour to them; they look upon
   him as a most attractive object, and therefore their hearts move after
   this loadstone. Everything is loved according to the suitableness and
   proportion it bears to our desires. Therefore see how Christ is spoken
   of by the faithful: Cant. v. 10, As the chiefest among ten thousand;'
   He beareth the banner from ten thousand,' as Ainsworth rendereth it.
   And in the 16th verse, He is altogether lovely.' But see what the world
   judgeth of him: Isa. lii. 14, His visage was marred more than any man,
   and his form more than the sons of men.' Look then to the value you
   have for a thing, for from thence will arise your endeavours after it.
   They that will be rich, are drowned and sunk in the cares of this
   world, they are all for moiling and business. They that love pleasures,
   their thoughts and the strength and vigour of their souls will run that
   way. So for honourable preferment, they that seek after it will spend
   all their thoughts about it. What a man valueth, it will be his work to
   gain. Therefore this high esteem of Christ taketh off men from these
   things, Acts xviii. 15, 16. He that thought the promulgation of the
   gospel to be but a strife about words and names, cared for none of
   these things.' This is the next hindrance; men that profess themselves
   Christians, make the getting of Christ the least of their care.

   [5.] A presumptuous conceit that we have entertained Christ already.
   Many think every slight wish, every trivial hope, will serve the turn.
   Many would be scholars, if they did not think themselves so too soon. I
   would not weaken any man's confidence; I know it is our office to
   establish it: The fruit of our lips is peace.' Isa. lvii. 19. But there
   are those to whom our God will not speak peace. No peace, saith my God,
   to the wicked.' Many wicked persons think it enough to be named
   Christians. It is an advantage, I confess, to be born a Christian, but
   to rest in it maketh it the greatest judgment that can be. People will
   reason thus, Do not all believe in Christ? Oh, no. Thou mayest profess
   Christ, and yet not believe in him. Many depend upon this that they are
   Christians, as the Jews did that they were the seed of Abraham. I shall
   touch upon this afterwards.

   [6.] Hardness of heart. The mind will not stoop to Christ till it be
   tamed. John Baptist, that was to prepare the way for Christ, was to
   bring the mountains and hills low, Luke iii. 5. The heart must not only
   be serious, but humbled, if it would entertain this doctrine. A man
   must see his error before he will be willing to be governed by Christ,
   and guided into a better way: Acts ii. 37, They were pricked at their
   hearts before the apostle bid them repent, and be baptized in the name
   of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins.' The heart never yields
   till it bleedeth with the sense of sin. We have been wrong, oh, what
   course shall we take? There must be a conviction of sin before that of
   righteousness. It is happy when both go together, John xvi. 9; so Acts
   xvi. 30, 31. First, What shall I do to be saved?' Then comes, Believe
   in the Lord Jesus Christ.' A man hath no reason to begin a new way till
   he is convinced of the vanity of the old one. There must be at least so
   much of humiliation as to make a man anxious and solicitous about a
   better course. Well, then, here is another hindrance: a proud and
   unmortified spirit, a hard heart; a man must get humbled, That you may
   do so, examine your state by the law, and aggravate it by love. There
   is some apprehension of love, some general consideration that precedeth
   faith. You have done all this, and you have done it against a merciful
   God, and indeed that is a keen argument to wound the spirit: Joel ii.
   14, Rend your hearts, for God is merciful.' See your sins, and
   aggravate them with unkindness. There is something in nature to make us
   relent, when we have done wrong to a kind person, that, for aught we
   know, meant better to us. But of this more by and by.

   [7.] Self-confidence. When men's consciences are troubled, they would
   fain get them eased. Those that are so greedy after quiet and peace,
   rather than holiness and grace, usually ease themselves in a wrong way;
   they fly to a few outward duties, or to some slight resolutions for
   God, and there rest. It is better to keep the conscience raw a while
   than to skin it over too soon; that will make the wound fester and
   rankle. Most desire ease too soon, they consult and contrive suddenly
   how they may ease themselves of that pain and horror that is upon them,
   and so vainly rest in the way of their own thoughts. A man should not
   look to be eased of grief till he find himself fitted for holiness,
   that he may not be engaged to the like grief again; otherwise we shall
   but stop the grief rather than cure it. We must be directed to a better
   course, and that must be only by Jesus Christ. It is a sign we are
   guilty of this self-confidence when we resolve upon a better life, and
   do not think how unable we are for it. Great resolutions are always
   vain, unless joined with the consideration of our own weakness. The
   people of God have promised much, but always it is with the concurrence
   of Christ. The apostle saith, Phil. iv. 12, I can,' or will do all
   things,' but it is through Christ.' David promiseth, Ps. cxix. 32, I
   will run the ways of thy commandments;' but he addeth, when thou shalt
   enlarge my heart.' There are divers such places in scripture. We walk
   in the strength of our resolutions when we do not see a need that
   Christ should help us, that we may not walk in the same ways of error
   and maze of misery again.

   [8.] Carnal fears. These hinder the soul from closing with that mercy
   that is reported to be in Christ. They are of divers sorts.

   (1.) Fear of God's anger, as if he were so displeased with us that
   certainly he did not intend Christ for us. Why, consider, the more
   angry God is, the more need there is to fly to his mercy. His mercy is
   as infinite as his wrath, nay, I may say more infinite: Ps. cxxxviii.
   2, Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name;' that is, God's
   promise in Christ is greater than all other things by which he hath
   made himself known. Christ was an instance of infinite wrath and
   infinite mercy at the same time, but rather of infinite mercy. Nay; to
   clear all, God expressly saith, Anger is not in me.'

   (2.) Fear of being too bold with the promises. Take heed of
   complimenting with God. A man cannot be too bold where he is so freely
   invited: Mat. xi. 28, Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy
   laden.' You are unworthy to believe, but God is worthy to be obeyed.
   And this is his commandment,' 1 John iii. 3, That we should believe in
   the name of Jesus Christ.'

   (3.) Fear of the sin of presumption. Oh! they shall presume too much. A
   man doth not presume if he knoweth his own danger; if he be lost to
   himself and his own apprehension, it is pity he should be lost to God
   too. Presumers are seldom troubled about their estate; it is enough to
   disturb a false peace so much as to suspect it. There can be no
   presumption where there are no slight thoughts of sin and mercy. The
   mind cannot presume when it is serious.

   [9.] Carnal reasonings from our sins. They are arguments of confidence,
   but not of dejection: Ps. xxv. 11, Pardon my sin, for it is great.' If
   so, it is the better for God to pardon. Sins should not hinder a man
   from duty. It is your duty to believe. The sense of sickness will cause
   us to make use of the physician. You cannot see anything in sin, but
   you may see more in Christ. Not greatness: Ps. lvii. 10, Thy mercy is
   great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.' Not number:
   Rom. v. 16, The free gift is of many offences unto justification.'

   [10.] And lastly, carnal apprehensions of Christ. We will believe no
   more to be in God than we find in ourselves: 1 Sam. xxiv. 19, Who
   findeth his enemy, and slayeth him not? will he let him go well away?'
   The soul in all her conclusions is only directed by premises
   experimental and of sensible apprehension. We think God is but as man;
   we are used to the dispositions of men, and therefore cannot believe
   there is anything more in God: Ps. l. 22, Thou thoughtest I was
   altogether such an one as thyself.' But remember, God is not a man,
   that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent,'
   Num. xxiii. 19; and Hosea xi. 9, I will spare Ephraim, for I am God,
   and not man;' so Isa. lv. 8-10, My thoughts are not your thoughts,
   neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord: For as the heavens are
   higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my
   thoughts than your thoughts:' Jer. iii. 1, If a man put away his wife,
   and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return to her
   again? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return
   unto me again, saith the Lord.'

   Use 1. Is by way of information. It informeth us of divers truths; as--

   1. That the paucity or fewness of followers is no disgrace to a thing
   or doctrine. The world followeth the multitude, as if the way to
   religion were like that to a town, where there is the greatest track:
   Luke xii. 32, Fear not, little flock,' mikro`n poi'mnion. Christ's
   flock is a little flock. The world usually casteth that prejudice.
   There may be but one Micaiah against four hundred false prophets.

   2. It informeth us that the number of believers is not as large as the
   number of professors: 2 Thes. iii. 2, All men have not faith.'

   3. That it is a very difficult thing to believe, and therefore so few
   attain it.

   Use 2. Is by way of examination. If but few are won to believe this
   report, examine yourselves--Are you of the number? Are you of the
   number of those that are won by the preaching of the word to believe in
   Christ? I will name a few effects:--

   1. If so, you will find this persuasion melting you: Zech. xii. 10, I
   will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of
   Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and supplication: and they shall look
   upon him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one
   mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one
   that is in bitterness for his first-born.' God and the soul come
   together just as Saul and David: 1 Sam. xxiv. 16, Saul lift up his
   voice and wept; Is this thy voice, my son David?' Thus the soul, Oh!
   didst thou love me so, O Lord my God?

   2. You will find it teaching you a way to resist sin. You could not
   tell how to prevail against it before, now you have a cutting argument
   against it: Titus ii. 11, 12, The grace of God, that bringeth
   salvation, hath appeared to all men; teaching us, that denying all
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
   godly in this present world.' Now you are taught to gainsay sin.

   3. You will find it quickening you to good: 2 Cor. v. 14, The love of
   Christ constraineth us.' Such melting commands and commanding
   entreaties have a powerful influence to that effect: I am crucified
   with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me:
   and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the
   Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.'

   I shall now come to the second point, namely--

   II. That the gospel, or the report concerning Jesus Christ, is the arm
   and power of God. Though it be our report, yet it is the arm of the
   Lord. There is some controversy, as I hinted before, about what is
   meant by the arm of the Lord; some applying it to Christ, some to the
   word. I rather incline to the latter; but it is good to observe, that
   what is spoken of Christ, the same is spoken also of the word. Christ
   is called the power of God,' 1 Cor. i. 24; and the gospel is called the
   power of God,' 1 Cor. i. 18; Rom. i. 16; because in the word Christ is
   made known, and his excellencies are displayed. And what is spoken of
   the word is spoken of faith. Christ is revealed to the heart by the
   word, and so he is likewise by faith.

   But in what respect is the gospel the arm and power of God?

   I answer:--

   1. In respect of the sense and meaning of it, which is to be regarded
   above the bare sound of the letters and syllables. Many make a charm of
   the word of God, by applying some sentences of it to drive away
   diseases in a way of exorcism and conjuration, or by coming to it in a
   customary way, as if the mere hearing or reading of it were sufficient;
   as if salvation were to be had by the bare hearing of it: John v. 39,
   Search the scriptures,' saith our Saviour, for in them ye think ye have
   eternal life, and they are they which testify of me.' Dokeite en autais
   zoen aionion, ye think ye have;' this is not barely a command, but a
   reproof, otherwise Christ would have said ye shall.' He speaketh it to
   the pharisees and hypocrites that had rejected him.

   2. In regard it manifests the power of God. There are instances of
   God's eternal power in the creatures, Rom. i. 20, but the great and
   mighty instances of his power are discovered in the word. God showeth
   his strength every day, but in the gospel he holdeth forth the man whom
   he hath made strong for himself,' Ps. lxxx. 15, the branch or Son,
   meaning Christ--though he is there speaking of the church's
   afflictions: The vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
   branch that thou makest strong for thyself.'

   3. It is said to be the arm and power of God, chiefly as it is a
   glorious instrument in his hands, as a weapon that is managed by the
   Spirit, which will work mightily indeed. It is observable that when
   Isaiah speaketh of the word as pronounced by the prophets, he saith our
   report; but as revealed by the Spirit, the arm of the Lord. You must
   understand it as accompanied with the Spirit's efficacy: 2 Cor. x. 4,
   The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God;' there lies its
   force. So 2 Cor. iii. 6, Who hath made us able ministers of the new
   testament: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.' He
   calleth the law the letter, as it showeth what is to be done, but
   ministereth no abilities. The letter killeth, leaveth us miserable, but
   the gospel, accompanied with the Spirit, is an efficacious instrument
   to beget life in us; because all the efficacy thereof depends upon the
   Spirit, therefore, in opposition to the law, it is called spirit.

   4. It is called the arm and power of God, because in one sense it
   worketh much even upon those on whom it has the least effect. It is
   powerful to their destruction, if not to their salvation: Heb. iv. 12,
   The word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged
   sword.' It is the savour of death unto death,' if not of life unto
   life.' It is not a dead letter even there where it cannot obtain the
   least entrance into the heart; it bindeth them over to judgment, if it
   cannot force them over to obedience. It is a heavy arm of God to the
   wicked; if they be not converted, they are judged, by the word. An arm,
   you know, is used in scripture in both senses, to protect friends, and
   to destroy enemies; and to that purpose it is said of God by the
   Psalmist: Ps. lxxxix. 13, Thou hast a mighty arm; strong is thy hand,
   and high is thy right hand.' This mighty power of the word appears
   divers ways.

   [1.] It troubleth sinners. The power of the gospel awakeneth their
   consciences, for fear of which they cannot so freely run into such
   excess and outrage as otherwise they would, Acts xxiv. 25. When Paul
   reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix
   trembled.' When a guilty conscience is touched, it is enraged: Acts
   vii. 54, When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, and
   gnashed on him with their teeth.' It causeth a tumult in the soul of a
   guilty creature; if nothing else, the word worketh such a trouble in
   them, that they cannot be at rest in their minds.

   [2.] It worketh some faint resolutions in sinners to look after Christ:
   Acts xxvi. 28, Thou almost persuadest me to be a Christian.' They have
   much ado to put off the force of the word, and therefore are even won
   by it. It argueth a mighty power in the gospel, that it can put a
   wicked man on acting, though weakly, against the bent and inclination
   of his evil heart. And it is some argument of the divine power in the
   gospel, that men are brought thereby to wish and resolve against their
   evil practices, though they will not leave them.

   [3.] It judgeth them, it bindeth them over to eternal punishment; as it
   is said, 1 Cor. xiv. 24, of the unbeliever, He is convinced of all, he
   is judged of all;' that is, his sentence is passed upon him in the
   word: John iii. 18, He that believeth not is condemned already;' that
   is, the power of the word is passed upon him: Mark xvi. 16, Go preach
   the gospel to every creature; he that believeth not shall be damned.'
   That is the peremptory sentence of the gospel.

   [4.] It punisheth them, the arm of God is upon them. It is said to the
   stubborn Jews, Zech. i. 6, But my words and my statutes, which I
   commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your
   fathers?' Mark, not so much the wrath and vengeance of God, as the
   prophet's words. So it is said, 1 Kings xix. 17, It shall come to pass,
   that he that escapeth the sword of Hazael, shall Jehu slay: and he that
   escapeth from the sword of Jehu, shall Elisha slay.' So Hosea vi. 5, I
   have hewed them by my prophets: I have slain them by the words of my
   mouth.' So much for the determination of this point.

   To prove it now, it will appear by two things:--

   1. By the uses for which God did appoint it.

   2. By the glorious effects of it, suitable to those ends of God. I
   shall handle both together.

   Let us consider the uses for which God did appoint the publication of
   the gospel, and certainly you will then say it is the arm of the Lord.
   God's designs by the preaching of the gospel are either public or
   private.

   First, Public, which are--

   1. To purchase and gain the world for a kingdom and an inheritance for
   Jesus Christ.

   2. To conquer all the enemies of Christ.

   Secondly, Private, so it is to convert souls. The appointment of the
   gospel for these ends showeth there is the arm of God in it.

   First, Public, which are--

   1. To purchase the whole world for a kingdom and an inheritance for
   Jesus Christ. This is the main end of the gospel, and therefore it is
   called, Ps. cx. 2, The sceptre and rod of Christ's strength.' The
   gospel is the sceptre of Christ; it was by the word that he was to sway
   the nations; and so Mat. xiii. 19, it is called the word of the
   kingdom.' Now, how should a man purchase a kingdom but by his arm?
   Great enterprises require proportionable strength, and therefore such a
   glorious design as this necessarily calleth for the arm and power of
   God. That this reason may have its due force on you, do but consider
   what it is to purchase the world for Christ, and what prejudices and
   difficulties there are against it that must be overcome.

   [1.] The report of Jesus Christ was a despised truth. If a man would
   win others to his conceits and opinions, policy requireth that he
   should make them as plausible as he can. It is difficult to win a
   people from their old religion, though a new one that is proposed be
   never so agreeable to reason. But now, when this is utterly
   inconsistent with our former apprehensions and notions about religion,
   the mind riseth against it; it stoppeth all further inquiry after the
   truth of it. Now such was the report of Jesus Christ to all the world:
   you may divide them into Jews and Gentiles. The Jews were to be brought
   off from their fond esteem of Moses and the prophets; the Gentiles were
   to be won from their old vain religions, received by traditions from
   their fathers: and we well know by experience how ill changes in
   religion are brooked in the world. But that was not all; they were to
   leave their religion that they had so long professed, and to expect
   (what they thought very absurd) eternal life and happiness by him whom
   they looked on as an object of misery, and who suffered such a shameful
   death himself: 1 Cor. i. 18, The preaching of the cross was to them
   that perished foolishness.' It might well be so among them that
   perished; the prejudice was as great among them that professed: Mat.
   xxvii. 42, He saved others; himself he cannot save: if he be the king
   of Israel, let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in
   him.'

   [2.] It was given forth by despised persons. If a man would be
   prevailed with by any, he would be by men of some repute and renown in
   the world. But now, Ps. viii. 6, Out of the mouth of babes and
   sucklings thou hast ordained strength.' If babes and sucklings could
   prevail so much by the use of their mouths, certainly there is some
   secret and invisible force in such doctrines, or else it would not
   prevail for babes and sucklings to speak so prevailingly as Christ
   promised: Luke xxi. 15, I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all
   your adversaries shall never be able to gainsay nor resist.' So much
   power in so much appearing weakness argueth a divine arm.

   2. The next end was to conquer the enemies of Christ. To conquer their
   minds, or destroy their bodies, the best weapon is the gospel,
   especially to do the former. This is the ark that beats all the Dagons
   in pieces. It is said, Isa. xi. 4, He shall smite the earth with the
   rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the
   wicked.' Mark, it is with the rod of his mouth; the gospel slayeth the
   outward enemies, and the mists of error do inwardly vanish before this
   sun. As--

   [1.] The paganish rites and worship were forced to give place to it, as
   the oracle of Delphos, which had voice enough left to proclaim its own
   silence, and also that among the rocks of Sicily. But then--

   [2.] As to antichristianism, God hath appointed the word to be a weapon
   against it: 2 Thes. ii. 8, it is said, God shall consume them with the
   spirit of his mouth, and with the brightness of his coming.' God
   bloweth in the mouth of his ministers the force of their words against
   Antichrist; it is the spirit or breath of his mouth. When the gospel
   was a little revived by Luther, how many of his kingdom did Antichrist
   lose? The goose-quill gave him a deadly wound, saith Beza; Rev. xi. 13:
   when the witnesses had finished their testimony, the tenth part of the
   city fell.' This is a most powerful engine to shake the strongholds of
   that city, these blasts of the gospel. The great policy of that party
   is to withhold people from the knowledge of the gospel. When Dr Day
   discoursed with Stephen Gardiner concerning free justification by
   Christ, saith he, O Mr Doctor, open that gap to the people, and we are
   undone!' The more gospel there is discovered, the more Antichrist is
   discovered. Free grace puts the foundation of that way out of course.

   [3.] All lesser errors, like the little foxes, are slain by this sword.
   Those that went greedily after Balaam and the doctrine of the
   Nicolaitans, what doth God say to them? Repent, or I will come and
   fight against thee with the sword of my mouth,' Rev. ii. 16; that is,
   with his word. That is punishment enough, to detect their errors by the
   gospel. The sword is put for a powerful weapon; the sword in the mouth
   showeth it was the word; God's appointing it to these great uses
   argueth there is a divine power in it.

   Secondly, Private; and that is to convert souls: Ps. xix. 7, The law of
   the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.' This is such a difficult
   work that it must needs require a divine power. That this may be of use
   to you, I shall show you what a difficult thing it is to convert a
   soul, there being so many obstacles and hindrances against it, and yet
   the word is the only fit instrument to overcome them.

   1. There is Satan, who is strong. The devil hath great power to possess
   the hearts of wicked men; he is said to work in the children of
   disobedience.' Eph. ii. 2. Those frequent possessions in Christ's time
   were a discovery of that spiritual thraldom in which the heart of man
   is engaged whilst in the service of the devil: 2 Tim. ii. 26, That they
   may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken
   captive by him at his will.' As violent tempests whirl things at their
   pleasure, so doth he our blinded understandings and crooked wills. We
   are taken of the devil in his snare, to be led about at his will and
   pleasure. Well, then, no power but that of God can set us free; it must
   be by the mighty ministry of his arm. The strong man will hold fast
   till he be cast out by a stronger than he, Luke xi. 22. It is not so
   easy dispossessing the old man, and to turn from the power of Satan to
   the power of God.

   2. The perverseness of man's heart. The chief hindrances there are
   these:--

   [1.] Subtle evasions, crafty pretences, whereby to evade and escape the
   power of the word: Heb. iv. 12, Piercing even to the dividing asunder
   of soul and spirit.' The soul is that faculty wherein the affections do
   reside; the spirit is the reasoning power; it discovereth the closest
   affections of the heart, and the most secret plots and devices of the
   spirit; it telleth the heart how it cleaveth to sin, and the mind how
   it plotteth pretences to hide it. The mind and spirit conspire
   together.

   [2.] Crafty disputes and reasonings. There are great and many perverse
   debates in our hearts against the things of God; therefore the apostle
   expresses the power of the word thus: 2 Cor. x. 5, Casting down
   imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the
   knowledge of God; and bringing into captivity every thought to the
   obedience of Christ.' It demolisheth all carnal reasonings, and
   convinceth of truth. Then--

   [3.] Swelling lusts. To tame these, nay, to set up the work of grace
   instead of these, must needs argue a divine hand. It is a hard matter
   to break the course of any inclination, much more of a rooted
   affection; to break the very course of nature; to turn lions into
   lambs, as it is said, The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the
   leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion
   and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.' There
   shall be such a wonderful change, that the violence and turbulency of
   the affections shall be done away. To make the filthy and intemperate
   to become chaste and sober, and to make the proud to become humble,
   argueth the great power of God. Thus you see how it overcometh
   difficulties.

   But now observe how powerfully and wonderfully the word worketh this.
   It is not by a fond conceit and opinion of it in the minds of men: The
   simple believeth every word,' as it is said in the Proverbs; and some
   weak persons may be easily awed into a scrupulous fear. But, on the
   contrary--

   (1.) It hath wrought upon them that have been cast upon it unawares,
   that looked for no such thing. The apostle saith of unbelievers: 1 Cor.
   xiv. 24, And there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned; he
   is convinced of all, he is judged of all,' if he be by chance put upon
   the ordinances. Thus we read in the story of Austin and of Firmus, who,
   though they looked for nothing less, yet were wrought upon, and
   converted to God.

   (2.) Those that came with a mind to despise the word have been won by
   it. The unbeliever that cometh in falleth down on his face, 1 Cor. xiv.
   25. It may bring men that have wrong conceits of the ways of God on
   their faces, and to say, God is in them of a truth.'

   Use 1. Is exhortation. And that--

   1. To ministers. Is the gospel the arm and power of God? Then--

   [1.] Be not ashamed of it, but preach it boldly. St Paul saith, Rom. i.
   16, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.' Many are ashamed of the
   naked simplicity of the gospel, and therefore hanker the more after
   profound parts and human learning. You must imitate Christ; preach
   boldly, as having authority from him.

   [2.] Wait for the success of it. Doubt of success is a great
   discouragement, and taketh off the wheels of a man's ministry. Refer it
   to God; it is his own arm, if it cannot be mighty through us, it will
   be mighty through God: Jer. i. 9, I have put my words in thy mouth.' It
   is a great lesson of holy wisdom, if we could learn it, to mind duty,
   and refer the success to God.

   [3.] To dispense it faithfully; not to use God's arm for our own ends.
   There is a preaching the gospel out of envy, Phil. i. 16. This is a put
   ting God in a servility to our designs, a prostituting of the greatest
   power to the vilest uses, an embasing a thing beneath its office.

   [4.] To dispense it so as to look to the Spirit to make it effectual;
   not to think to make it work by our own fancies: 1 Cor. ii. 4, My
   preaching was not with the enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
   demonstration of the Spirit and of power.' A minister may be apt to be
   too full of self. The old Adam may be too hard for young Melancthon. It
   is said of Christ, Luke xxiv. 32, that he opened the scriptures;' and
   ver. 45, Then he opened their understandings, that they might
   understand the scriptures,'

   2. To the people.

   [1.] To all in general.

   [2.] To those to whom the arm of the Lord is revealed and made known.

   [1.] To all in general: to press them to see God in his word. Many see
   no more than what is of man, and therefore are not wrought upon by it.
   The power of God is veiled under our weakness: 1 Thes. ii. 13, Ye
   received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of
   God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.' But what is
   it to receive it as the word of God?

   I answer--It is to receive it:--

   (1.) With reverence. It is a description of God's people that they
   tremble at his word,' Isa. lxvi. 2, 5. Do not slight it as if it were
   but a little sound poured out into the air.

   (2.) Look up unto God, and wait upon him for this power to be let into
   your hearts. See that, besides the report, you have a discovery of
   God's power and arm. Do not rest contented with enjoying the word till
   you feel the power of God making it effectual on your hearts. Oh, be
   careful lest it should work upon you the wrong way, and prove the
   savour of death unto death! As the people waited^for the angel's
   stirring of the waters, so do you for the Spirit's motion. Man's voice
   can but pierce the ear: Cathedram habet in coelis qui corda docet, God
   only can reach the heart.

   (3.) Receive it into your hearts, open your souls for it with such a
   resolution as is expressed, Acts x. 33, We are all here present before
   thee, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.' Then it is a
   sign we are willing to take home the message to ourselves.

   (4.) Let not your thoughts rest in the abilities of the minister, if
   your hearts be touched: Acts iii. 12, Peter answered unto the people,
   Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly
   upon us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to
   walk?' It is not our report, but God's arm; we are but the instruments,
   his arm must do the work.

   [2.] To those to whom the arm of the Lord is made known, two duties I
   shall exhort them unto:--

   (1.) To behold and admire the power of God working in them for their
   salvation: Eph. i. 19, That ye may know the exceeding greatness of his
   power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty
   power.' A man doth not know the excellency of this power till he takes
   a review of it. Man can better observe such experiences when past, when
   he seeth and feeleth such a power of God upon his soul.

   (2.) To walk worthy of it in their conversation;--to walk so as a man
   may perceive the power of God hath passed upon him: 1 Peter ii. 9, That
   you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of
   darkness into his marvellous light.' Inward holiness is expressed by
   the power of godliness. Take heed of having a form of godliness but
   denying the power thereof. Oh, do not carry it as if there were no
   power passed upon you!

   Use 2. Is of examination. See whether any of this power hath passed
   upon your hearts. Have you ever felt the power of the Spirit in the
   ordinances, that will convince of sin, of righteousness, and of
   judgment?

   1. Hath it powerfully humbled you for sin? There is the power of the
   word seen to bring men upon their faces, and to make them lay their
   mouths in the dust, 1 Cor. xiv. 25. The first work is to humble the
   heart and to subdue the pride of it.

   2. Is it powerful to comfort and refresh the soul? Every man hath not
   comfort, but every man that hath it can tell which way it cometh: Ps.
   xciv. 19, In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts
   delight my soul.' What is the refreshment of your hearts? Is it not the
   power of God's Spirit? When a man is in distress, it is known what he
   maketh his trust in: then we shall see what our heart fetcheth comfort
   from. Do you look upon gospel comforts as powerful? John xvi. 33, In
   the world ye shall have tribulation, but in me ye shall have rest; be
   of good cheer, I have overcome the world.'

   3. Is it powerful to enable to holiness? You will then be able to gain
   upon your lusts more, they will not be so pleasing to you: Ps. cx. 3,
   Thy people shall be a willing people in the day of thy power.' You will
   be made ready to duty, and be more cheerful in God's service, when the
   power of the word hath passed upon you.

   I now proceed to the last point observable in this verse, which is:--

   III. That none believe the report that is made of Jesus Christ, but
   those to whom it is revealed by the Spirit.

   It is meant of an inward revelation; though it were outwardly
   proclaimed in their ears, yet the power of the report was not secretly
   conveyed into their hearts. The arm of the Lord was not revealed to
   them. Or thus:--

   The cause why so few are won to believe in Jesus Christ is because they
   have not the Spirit's revelation.

   This I shall prove to you by these reasons:--

   1. Because without the Spirit's revelation all the outward tenders and
   reports^of Jesus Christ will be to no purpose. The efficacy of the word
   lieth in the Spirit's assistance. I told you in the former point how
   powerful the word of God is, but withal I told you it was when the
   Spirit sets it home upon the heart. God may knock at the door and yet
   no man open to him; and, therefore, he speaketh by way of supposition,
   if he doth but barely knock: Rev. iii. 20, Behold, I stand at the door
   and knock; if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in
   to him and sup with him, and he with me.' It is put upon an if: it is a
   great peradventure whether any man will open the door or no, when it is
   but a bare knock of the word. The spouse pleadeth excuses when Christ
   stood and knocked, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my
   undefiled,' Cant. v. 2; but in the 4th verse it is said, My beloved put
   in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for
   him;'--that signifieth the working of his Spirit, and then she opened.
   Men would fain take one nap more in sin when they are roused by the
   ministry; but when God puts his fingers upon the handles of the lock,
   Christ hath an admittance and the door then flieth open: Acts xi.
   19-21, The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed
   and turned to the Lord.' God's hand was upon the lock. If the word be
   anywhere spoken of as powerful, it is in reference to the Spirit, as 1
   Thes. i. 5, Our word came unto you not in word only, but also in power
   and in the Holy Ghost;' therefore in power, because in the Holy Ghost.

   2. Because the Spirit's revelation is the token of God's special love;
   and that is not given to every one: God has appointed his special love
   but for a few. The outward revelation is to leave men without excuse;
   it is but a token of God's common love: 2 Cor. iv. 3, If our gospel be
   hid, it is hid to them that are lost--hidden from their hearts, though
   it be revealed to their ears. Those that are lost have not the inward
   discoveries--that is, the effectual discovery and special effect of
   God's peculiar love: Acts xiii. 48, As many as were ordained to eternal
   life believed;' such have God's special love. Those that have least
   have many times an outward revelation: Acts xiv. 17, God left not
   himself without a witness, in that he did good;' yet, ver. 16, he
   suffered them to walk in their own ways.' They had a revelation, but
   they had not an efficacious revelation. And in this sense it is said,
   that many are called but few are chosen,--many are invited and few
   wrought upon. They have the doctrine of life propounded to them, but
   they have not the Spirit of life setting it home upon their hearts; few
   taste of God's special love.

   3. Because the least of Christ that is made known to the soul is made
   known by the Spirit; even common illumination, any slight taste of the
   doctrine of life, it cometh from the Spirit. Those that apostatised
   afterwards are said, Heb. vi. 4, to be made partakers of the Holy
   Ghost.' A historical persuasion of the truth of the articles of
   religion flows hence. There are some things like this inward effectual
   revelation in the hearts of wicked men, namely, some notional
   irradiations and illuminations in many profound mysteries of the
   scripture. In this sense is that place to be understood: 1 Cor. xii. 3,
   No man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;' and that,
   No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost.' Even
   their common illumination and profession that Jesus is the Lord was
   from the Holy Ghost. And so that, Mat. xvi. 16, 17, Thou art Christ,
   the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered, Flesh and blood hath not
   revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.' He did not
   learn this from nature, but from a revelation. Even, I say, a notional
   apprehension of these truths, without any fiducial assent given to
   them, is from the manifestation of the Spirit, and, therefore, much
   more is this the cause of believing.

   4. Because there is so much corruption in a man that hindereth the soul
   from believing in Jesus Christ, that it cannot be done away without the
   Spirit's manifestation. There is a double seat of this corruption--the
   mind and the heart. First, In the mind there is ignorance and
   unteachableness. Secondly, In the heart there is obstinacy and
   carelessness; which things cannot be conquered any otherwise than by
   the Spirit of God. Let us look upon these things severally. Consider a
   man naturally as he is:--

   [1.] In his mind; and so--

   (1.) There is ignorance; he hath no savoury apprehension of the truths
   of God: 1 Cor. ii. 14, The natural man receiveth [not the things of the
   Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know
   them, because they are spiritually discerned.' There is no suitableness
   between the heart and the things of Christ; and, therefore, though they
   understand the words, they have confused apprehension of the thing, and
   cannot tell what to make of them for their comfort and peace. These
   sottish conceits in the minds of men prepossess them against the
   receiving of Jesus Christ. They are like leaky vessels that cannot hold
   this precious liquor; the cockleshell of their brains cannot empty this
   ocean. A natural man hath abundance of confused, indistinct, indefinite
   conceits of Jesus Christ. Festus said, Acts xxv. 19, That the Jews and
   Paul had a controversy about their own superstitions, and of one Jesus,
   that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive;' as if it were no more.
   And the like conceits are to be found not only in him but in all
   natural men. They do but look upon him as Austin in his infancy said he
   did upon God, Tanquam aliquem magnum--as some great remedy against all
   evils. Now these conceits, though they be a little rectified in some by
   pregnancy of wit, ripeness of experience, and industrious meditation,
   yet no savoury knowledge, nor wisdom to salvation, can be fetched out
   of these divine truths but by the Spirit. We cannot learn Christ, as
   the apostle speaketh. A man may know Christ, but he hath not learned
   Christ, Eph. iv. 20. That supposeth a teacher, which is the Spirit of
   God: John vi. 45, They shall all be taught of God.' The Spirit teacheth
   us Christ, so as to have communion and fellowship with him--to fetch
   comfort out of him; and this helpeth our natural light, and doth indeed
   set off Christ to us: Job xxxii. 8, There is a spirit in man, and the
   inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.' Then we begin
   to look upon Jesus Christ with a true and distinct eye. A man may have
   eyes, but if he have not light he cannot see well, nor discern the
   distinct shape of things. Light must come to light;--first the light of
   the sun or candle to the light of the eye. Thus our reason must be
   helped to fasten upon divine truths so as to fetch comfort out of them.
   Thus ignorant men cannot tell what to make of the promises of the
   gospel or the commandments of the gospel, what to think of Christ or
   what to believe. Therefore, it is said, 1 Cor. ii. 10, The deep things
   of God' are revealed to us by his Spirit;' that giveth us the knowledge
   of the truth and worth of them.

   (2.) Unteachableness. We are not only in the dark, but blind; we have
   not only lost the use, but the faculty: 1 Cor. ii. 14, The natural man
   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
   unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
   discerned.' We have no spiritual eyes, and therefore we cannot see
   spiritual things. Things are apprehended by us according as they carry
   a proportion and suitableness to our hearts. Now our hearts are so
   gross that we cannot measure truths by them. This unteachableness
   remaineth in the soul till the Spirit disposes it to knowledge; and
   therefore St Paul prayeth, Eph. i. 17, 18, That God would give them the
   Spirit of wisdom and revelation r and open the eyes of their
   understanding'--take away the scales, And so you read, Luke xxiv. 29,
   That Christ opened their understanding;' i.e., made it teachable. The
   word is not only proposed to them to rectify their apprehensions of
   Christ, but their minds are opened; which implieth, that as they had no
   light, so they had closed eyes, a wicked mind as well as a weak mind, a
   mind disaffected, prejudiced, full of corrupt principles and reasonings
   that are advanced the truth. [8]

   [2.] In the heart there is carelessness and stubbornness. And
   therefore, as God must teach their minds, so he must draw their hearts;
   as it is said, John vi. 44, No man cometh unto me, except the Father
   draw him.' The power of the Spirit must be put forth into the soul to
   bend it to Christ.

   Let us take notice of these two evils.

   (1.) Carelessness. Men slight Christ, and then they are not won to
   believe in him. This carelessness cometh from two things:--

   (1st.) A love of ease. Men cannot think of Christ without reluctancy,
   and they are loth to put themselves to the trouble. When the spouse is
   lodged in the bed of security, see how she pleadeth: I have put off my
   coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile
   them?' A carnal, careless heart, that loveth ease, sticketh at every
   little hesitancy and vain excuse. In hot countries, where they went
   barefoot, they were wont to wash their feet after travel. They are loth
   to arise to entertain Christ for fear of trouble and loss to
   themselves: Prov. xx. 4, The sluggard will not plough because of the
   cold.' Many do not care for Christ, because it will cost them some
   pains and care to pursue after him. They must follow him through so
   many prayers, meditation, and observation, that they had rather sit
   still. There is need of a great deal of revelation to make the soul
   seriously to attend. The spouse fainted, Cant. v. 6, when Christ put
   his finger into the key-hole of the lock: Then I rose up and opened to
   my beloved, and my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone; my soul
   failed when he spake.' When he beginneth to touch the wards of the
   heart, all idle excuses vanish, then nothing but Christ will satisfy
   the heart. So Acts ii. 37, When they were pricked in their hearts, then
   they cried out, Men and brethren, what shall we do?' Men that are not
   converted indulge their vain thoughts and excuses still; but when that
   is once past, they cannot dally with salvation any more: Acts xvi. 30,
   the jailer saith Sirs, what must I do to be saved?' Oh, tell me
   quickly, it can brook no delay!

   (2dly.) Doting upon other excellencies. One love, like a nail, driveth
   out another, A man slighteth a thing when the stream of his affections
   are carried another way. Some had a farm, some a yoke of oxen, some had
   married a wife, some one excuse, some another; but. they all said, I
   cannot come.' Men are severally taken up, either with honours, or
   profits, or pleasures; but all keep from Christ. Therefore there is
   need of the Spirit's revelation, to display the beauties of Christ
   before the soul, that they may see that there is more in this beloved
   than in other beloveds, Cant. v. 9; that so the force of our ill
   affections may be broken, and the stream of the heart diverted another
   way, and brought about to Christ. This is that which is desired in that
   request, Draw me; we will run after thee,' Cant. i. 4; that the Spirit
   would display the glory of Christ to the soul, that we may look upon
   him as an attractive object, and so find our hearts and our desires
   following after him. Thus for carelessness.

   (2.) Stubbornness of heart, that is another thing. There is a
   wilfulness in men; they will not believe, because they will not
   believe. Men will not close with Jesus Christ; God showeth them the
   way, and they contemptuously reject it: John v. 40, Ye will not come
   unto me, that ye might have life.' Christ inviteth men by the gospel:
   Come unto me, all you that are weary and heavy laden;' and they will
   not come; there is no answer in the heart to God's call because of this
   stubbornness of spirit. But now, when gospel invitations are seconded
   with the Spirit's motions, they command their own entrance into the
   soul, the heart submits to the way that God revealeth for its good. The
   heart, like a quick, strong echo, returneth the full answer of gospel
   demands: Ps. xxvii. 8, When thou saidst unto me, Seek ye my face, my
   heart said, Thy face, Lord, will I seek;' Zech. xiii. 9,I will say, It
   is my people; and they shall say, The Lord is my God.' So much for the
   proof of the point.

   I shall answer a doubt or two before I go on to the application.

   The doubts are these:--

   1. If the want of the Spirit's revelation be the cause why so few
   believe, how can God be just in punishing men for their unbelief, since
   he doth not give them all a like revelation?

   I answer--Two ways: First, From God's sovereignty: Exod. xxxiii. 19, I
   will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have mercy on
   whom I will have mercy;' so Rom. ix. 15, 16. God's will is the measure
   of his actions, as the moral law is the measure of our actions. That is
   a rule to us, not to God; he giveth no account of his matters, he
   acteth out of infinite sovereignty, and so he may do what he pleaseth
   Who shall set a task for him? Mat. xi. 25, 26, I thank thee, O Father,
   Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise
   and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so. Father,
   because it seemed good in thy sight.' That is the upshot of all, and
   the result of all disputes about it: Even so, Father, because it
   pleaseth thee.' He doth not tell you for what cause it pleased the
   Father; but even so it pleased him, as if that were reason enough: it
   is just because it pleased the Father. You are not to be judges of
   God's actions, but doers of his will. God made you not to censure him,
   but to give him glory. The pattern of all justice is to be copied out
   from God's will; it is just because God did it.

   Secondly, The beauty of God's justice shineth in this, in that the
   positive cause of unbelief--

   [1.] Is in ourselves, it being through our own blindness and
   stubbornness. We will not come to him that we may have life.' Hosea
   xiii. 9, O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thy help.'
   God is the positive cause of faith, the privative cause of unbelief.
   The Spirit's revelation worketh faith; but in case of the want of it,
   our own perverse hearts are the cause of unbelief. If the earth be
   light, it is from the sun; but if it be dark, it is through the want of
   the sun, that is from itself: 2 Cor. iv. 3, If our gospel be hid, it is
   hid to them that are lost.' It is to those that take a course to ruin
   themselves.

   [2.] Men do not their utmost, and therefore are justly punished,
   because they did not what they were able to do to get faith. He is
   justly condemned that complaineth of the length of the way, and
   therefore doth not stir one foot to see whether he shall conquer it,
   yea or no: Mat. xxv. 26, Thou wicked and slothful servant.' Many
   complain, as if God required brick and gave no straw. They are wicked
   and slothful; they do not what they should. Men had rather accuse God
   than reflect upon their own idleness; they will not come to him.

   [3.] They abuse their parts, and are so far from improving of them to
   the utmost, that they employ them against God: Jude 10, What they know
   naturally as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.' So
   2 Peter ii. 12, it is said, They utterly perish in their .own
   corruptions.' There is wickedness enough in them to cause the wrath of
   God to proceed against them. This is the first doubt.

   2. The next is (which is somewhat answered out of this) if this
   because--viz., the want of the Spirit's revelation--Why then should we
   labour after faith? Our labour will not do without the revelation of
   the Spirit..

   Ans. [1.] We should labour after it, to see our own weakness, that we
   may look up to God the more earnestly for it. Men think it is easy to
   believe till they put themselves upon the trial. They do not see a need
   of the Spirit till they perceive the fruitlessness of their own
   endeavours: If thou appliest thy heart to understanding, and criest
   after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou
   seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as hidden treasure; then
   shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of
   God,' Prov. ii: 3-5.

   [2.] That we may manifest our obedience to God, and meet him in his own
   way. He hath commanded us to believe; let us do what we can towards it.
   Improve your natural abilities, and use the means that God hath
   appointed, and refer the success to him: Luke v. 5, Master, we have
   toiled all night, and catched nothing; nevertheless, at thy command I
   will let down the net.' Consider God's prerogative over you, and make
   the best of the power you have; and if for nothing else, yet at his
   command perform thy duty. God hath enabled you to do somewhat, and he
   may justly require you should do the utmost of it. Every man hath a
   command over his locomotive faculty; he can choose whether he will come
   hither or go thither. Every man can watch at the gates of wisdom,'
   Prov. viii. 34, and wait at the posts of her door.' Therefore, let the
   command of God enforce you to do what you can.

   [3.] That you may manifest your desires after it. God doth not give
   Christ to many, because they do not care for him. If a man did care for
   a thing, he would endeavour after it. Excuses are always a sign of an
   unwilling heart. Where the desires are vehement, they will not easily
   be put by: Mat. xiii. 45, The merchant that found a pearl of great
   price,' went and sold all that he might buy it.' Those that desire not
   Christ, do not look upon him as a pearl of price; if they did, their
   hearts would follow hard after him. Those that say they have no power,
   it is to be feared they have no heart. It was the slothful person said,
   There is a lion in the way,' Prov. xxvi. 13. Therefore strive after
   faith, if for nothing else, yet to show that Christ is worth your most
   earnest seeking and pursuit after him.

   [4.] Because though by the using of means we do not get faith, yet
   without the means we shall not have it. It is conditio sine qua non,
   though not causa fidei: Rom. x. 14, How shall they believe in him of
   whom they have not heard?' A man hath it not by hearing, nor for
   hearing, yet he hath it not without hearing. There is not merit nor
   efficacy in the means, and yet there must be the presence of them,
   because it holdeth negatively, if ye do not use the means ye shall
   never believe. The Spirit causeth faith, but it is by the word: see
   that text, Acts xiii. 46, It was necessary that the word of God should
   first have been spoken unto you; but seeing ye have put it from you,
   and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the
   Gentiles.' Men that refuse the means, pass the sentence of condemnation
   upon themselves, they declare themselves to be those whom God will
   judge to be unworthy of eternal life--unworthy, because they would not
   seek after it. When the psalmist describeth desperate men, he
   represents them to be such as reject the means: Ps. lviii.4, 5, They
   are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear, which will not hearken
   to the voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely.' The adder
   stoppeth one ear with her tail, and the other lieth close upon the
   ground. So wicked men, if they come to the ordinances, take care they
   shall not prevail upon them; they are not diligent to attend to the
   word.

   [5.] It is very likely God will come in and meet with us if we seek him
   in his own ways; and who would not venture upon a likelihood of safety
   to come out of a certain danger? If you do not use the means, you are
   sure to perish; if you do, you may be likely to obtain mercy; and
   certainly it is the safest course to adventure upon these hopes. The
   soul reasoneth in such a case just as the Aramites did: 2 Kings vii. 4,
   If we enter into the city, there is the famine, we shall die there; if
   we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come and let us fall into
   the host of the Assyrians; if they save us alive, we shall live, and if
   they kill us, we shall but die.' So if we continue in our sins, it is
   death; if we neglect prayer, or hearing, or meditation, it is death;
   though there be but an if of mercy, venture upon it, a little to keep
   up the heart. Men near drowning will catch hold, though it be but of a
   reed or a twig.

   [6.] This is God's usual way, to meet those that seek him. The God of
   Jacob would not have them seek his face in vain, Isa. xlv. 19, and Luke
   xi. 9; though he would not arise and give as his friend, yet because of
   his importunity, he will arise and give him. When the soul is
   importunate with God thus, it is a sign of mercy, and it is through the
   precedaneous efficacy of the Spirit. This earnestness after faith is
   the first impression of the Spirit's efficacy. Thus I have answered the
   doubts.

   I shall now come to the application.

   The first use is exhortation, to press you to divers duties; as--

   1. To wait for the Spirit's motion and revelation. Do not look to the
   words that are spoken, but how the Spirit giveth you the savoury sense
   and meaning of them. They that were at the pool looked for the angel's
   stirring of the waters; so do you look for the Spirit's revelation, to
   see how the confusedness of your light and knowledge is done away. The
   mind knoweth some things, but doth not know things as it should know
   them. See how the Spirit giveth you satisfaction. If you would have
   faith, your chief care is to attend the Spirit; and therefore, faith is
   called by the Spirit's own name, the same Spirit of faith,' 2 Cor. iv.
   13, because it is the faith of the Spirit.

   2. Yield to it. Many are of an unteachable heart, they are not won by
   the Spirit's allurements: Gen. ix. 27, God shall persuade (or enlarge)
   Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem.' God shall allure the allurable.
   Take heed you resist not the secret whispers and persuasions of God's
   Spirit. There is a great deal of thwarting in the heart against it,
   that God's Spirit, when it should allure, it is forced to dispute it;
   and therefore God saith, Gen. vi. 3, My Spirit shall no longer strive
   with men.' The Spirit convinceth us this is right, and then our
   interests and vile affections set the heart a-disputing against it; and
   we would fain put off these inward motions and checks of conscience.
   Many of God's elected servants do very often resist those motions, so
   that it were even just with God to cast them off, but that Christ's
   word is passed: John vi. 37, All that my Father giveth me shall come to
   me, and I will in no wise cast them out.' But as to reprobates, God
   stayeth a great while with them too. No longer, implieth a long time,
   even as long as he shall think fit, and then he leaveth them. Take heed
   of these withdrawings.

   3. Cherish it. Many have had strong resolutions, but they die away
   without this. They have a great many previous workings of the Spirit,
   as, much knowledge of the will of God, much sense of sin, fear of
   punishment, many thoughts about their freedom and deliverance, some
   hopes of pardon, some kind of care and desire; but then they drown
   these things again by the cares and pleasures of this world, and so
   they are to no purpose. This is called by the apostle quenching of the
   Spirit,' 1 Thes. v. 19. Now, the Spirit is quenched two ways:--

   [1.] When they do not blow up the coals, stir up the graces of God that
   are in them, and labour to feed and cherish by prayer and meditation
   these desires, which is the strengthening of the things which are ready
   to die, Rev. iii. 2; when we do not labour to rouse up our selves, and
   keep in the heat and warmth in our souls: Mat. xiii. 19, Then cometh
   the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in their hearts.'

   [2.] When they do as it were cast water on the Spirit's motion by the
   return of their lusts. Men are apt to return to their old ways, after
   these partial desires and partial care to get Christ; but 2 Peter ii.
   21, It had been better for them not to have known the way of
   righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy
   commandment delivered to them.' Enraged lusts return the stronger, and
   have the greater force upon the heart.

   4. In case you have it, praise God for it. Oh, get largeness of heart
   to conceive of this great privilege, to have Christ not only to be
   revealed to you, but in you! There is a threefold ground of
   thankfulness:--

   [1.] In respect of yourselves, that God was not discouraged with your
   often resistance of him, but that he should go on with his work: Isa.
   lxvi. 9, Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?' God
   speaketh of the outward glory of his church, but it is also true of
   grace in the hearts of his servants. Oh, how justly might God have
   broken off and interrupted his design and purpose of grace and mercy,
   and have given over such a stubborn heart as yours to the sway of its
   lusts! As Elizabeth said, Luke i. 43, Whence is this, that the mother
   of my Lord should come to me?' So whence is it that the Spirit of the
   Lord should come to me, stubborn me? There should be such a reflection
   upon our unkindness.

   [2.] In respect of the freeness of the gift, that he should give his
   Spirit to work faith in us so freely. Faith is expressed to be the gift
   of God, Eph. ii. 8; Phil. i. 29, To you it is given to believe,' humin
   echaristhe; you have it of the free grace of God. Flesh would fain
   boast, and have these things in its own power, but you see, to you it
   is given.'

   J3.] In respect of others. That he should reveal himself unto you, not
   unto others. What did he see in you more than in others, that he should
   give you a token of his distinguishing love? Christ thanketh God for
   the distinguishingness of it: Father, I thank thee, that thou hast
   hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them
   to babes,' Mat. xi. 26. And therefore we have the greater reason so to
   do: John xiv. 22, How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us,
   and not unto the world?' Thus you see what cause there is of
   thankfulness on this threefold account.

   Use 2. Is examination, to see whether you have closed with the report
   of Jesus Christ or no. If you have closed with it aright, it is with
   the Spirit's revelation, it is because you have been inwardly convinced
   in your hearts of the truth of it. But how shall we know that we
   believe in the report because of the Spirit's revelation, and that many
   will say and every one crieth it up for a truth, that Jesus Christ came
   to save sinners? I answer:--

   1. The Spirit's revelations are distinct; it showeth the soul how
   Christ will be received. Most men's knowledge of Christ is an in
   definite knowledge; they know him in a confused, indistinct, indefinite
   manner; they look upon him as a Saviour, but they do not look upon him
   as commanding things contrary to their vile affections. Now the Spirit
   revealeth him determinately, what he is, and upon what terms we must
   take him.

   2. It giveth men an experimental taste of Christ: 1 Peter ii. 3, If so
   be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.' They can speak of
   what sweetness there is in Christ. Notional knowledge looketh upon him
   as a man looketh upon a thing in the bulk. When a man hears a minister
   talk of Christ, he taketh it up as a great and comfortable truth, but
   he cannot speak out of experience. All Christians can speak out of
   their desires, though not delights: Oh, come, taste and see how good
   the Lord is!

   3. The Spirit revealeth so as to influence us to obedience. Spiritual
   li^ht is like that of the sun, it hath heat with it. But now it is
   otherwise with notional irradiations, and common illuminations; the
   heart is vain, and the conference conduceth to controversy, more than
   to the conversion of others.

   Use 3. The third and last use is to condemn all that false faith that
   is in most people: they think they believe in Christ, whereas they
   scarcely believe the report of him. True faith hath a true ground. Most
   men have this in their thoughts, that there was such a person as
   Christ; the preachers tell them so; the laws of the land and the
   customs of the people are for it. Alas! most people are like wax, they
   are fit to take the stamp and impression of any religion that is
   bequeathed to them. They are not said so properly to believe, as to
   have a superficial apprehension of the common report that is made
   concerning such a thing. They have no more saving faith in Christ than
   Turks and infidels, and have as little true love for him as the Jews
   that crucified him. I cannot examine every false ground. I will give
   you marks in general when you have it from any wrong ground; as--

   1. When you take it up without weighing: Prov. xiv. 15, The simple
   believeth every word, but the prudent man looketh well to his going.'

   2. By your fickleness; when a man embraceth a thing upon wrong grounds,
   he will leave it upon wrong grounds: Gal. i. 6, I marvel that you are
   so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto
   another gospel;' 2 Thes. ii. 2, I beseech you, brethren, be not soon
   shaken in mind.'

   3. By the dissonancy of our practice, and inconstant resolutions. This
   is called, 2 Peter ii. 1, a denying Christ that bought us.' Though they
   profess him in words, yet in deeds they deny him. It were better to
   renounce the profession of Christ than to keep it with these
   resolutions: Mat. vi. 31-33, Take no thought what ye shall eat, or what
   ye shall drink, or wherewith ye shall be clothed; for after all these
   things do the Gentiles seek; but seek ye first the kingdom of God, and
   his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.'

THE SECOND VERSE.

   For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of
   a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness: and when we shall see
   him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.

   I AM now to make entrance upon the cause and ground of the Jews'
   unbelief, namely, Christ's meanness and sufferings. His meanness is
   described:--

   1. In regard of his birth.

   2. In regard of his manner of life, and outward appearance in the
   world, which are the two things the prophet prosecutes in divers
   expressions. I shall take notice of them in this and the following
   verses.

   My method shall be:--

   1. To open the phrases to you as they lie in the order of the words.

   2. To apply them to Jesus Christ, and to give you some helps for your
   meditation.

   3. Because Christ's life holdeth forth much matter of observation for
   the guiding of our lives, I shall give some more general and practical
   points, that so what is said of Christ may be useful for us.

   First, For the phrases, and these respect:--

   First, His birth and original; and here three expressions are to be
   explained.

   1. He shall grow up as a tender plant. What is meant by that? The
   Septuagint (because the word for tender plant signifieth also a sucker)
   have translated it os paidi'on. We have spoken of him as a sucking
   child. But I conceive it is not put here to signify the infancy of
   Christ, so much as the low and mean manner of the original that he
   would take upon himself. He would be as a tender plant, not as a tall
   tree full of limbs and branches. For it is usual in scripture to set
   forth the several conditions of men by trees and plants: thus
   Nebuchadnezzar's greatness and strength are represented, Dan. iv. 21,
   22, by the tree whose leaves were fair, whose fruits were much, and the
   branches thereof reaching to heaven and shading the earth. So the
   Psalmist describes the wicked's prosperity, Ps. xxxvii. 35, I have seen
   the wicked great in power, and spreading himself like a green
   bay-tree.' And on the contrary, misery is expressed by the heath in the
   desert, a low mean shrub, Jer. xvii. 6. So here, Christ's meanness and
   poverty are held forth by a tender plant, newly sprouted forth, and
   come up above the earth, which a man would tread upon rather than
   cherish. And indeed it is observable that Christ is often represented
   by the expression of a tender plant, or as a branch: thus Isa. xi. 1,
   There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch
   shall grow out of his roots.' I shall touch upon it again. So it is
   said, Zech. iii. 8, I will bring forth my servant the branch.' So chap.
   vi. 12, The man whose name is The Branch:' Jer. xxiii. 5, Behold the
   days shall come that I will raise unto David the righteous branch;'
   Jer. xxxiii. 15, Behold, I will cause the branch of righteousness to
   grow up unto David.' And I conceive this expression holdeth forth two
   things:--

   [1.] Christ's present meanness, what he was in the world's eye, which
   was no more than a branch or twig.

   [2.] His future glory. He should be a tree: Ezek. xvii. 22-24, Thus
   saith the Lord, I will also take of the highest branch of the high
   cedar, and I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender
   one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent; and it shall
   bring forth boughs, and bear fair fruit, and become a goodly cedar; and
   under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the
   branches thereof shall they dwell.' Thus it was a tender plant, yet
   such a one as might become a spacious and goodly tree.

   2. A root out of a dry ground; that is, not only a tender branch, but a
   branch that hath little verdure and freshness. But why a root? And why
   out of a dry ground? The root does not come up, but the branches. I may
   answer--Root is put figuratively, the cause for the effect, the root
   for the sprigs; or else to denote the dryness of the branch; it was not
   fresh and green: even like a root, or like heath in the wilderness,
   which is a branch and root too. Or more properly it may be to show that
   Christ is such a branch as that he is a root likewise. And I the rather
   take notice of this, because the scripture doth so: Rev. v. 5, The Lion
   of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the
   book;' and chap. xxii. 16, I am the root and offspring of David.' Mark,
   not the branch, but the root. Christ was David's son and David's Lord,
   Mat. xxii. 45, yet a root out of a dry ground.' Some triflers
   understand by this is meant the womb of the virgin; but it is rather
   the dead and withered stock of David's house. For though that family
   was obscure, and all the glorious branches cut off to the very stump,
   yet even then shall sprout out the last and greatest ornament of it,
   like a root out of a dry ground. Therefore it is observable it is said,
   Isa. xi. 1, A rod shall come out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch out
   of his roots.' He doth not say, out of the stem of David, who was the
   first king and honour of that family, but Jesse, whose name was more
   obscure, implying that at this time this house should be reduced to its
   first meanness, or that it should not be the house of David so much as
   the house of Jesse. Out of his decayed roots should spring up this
   tender branch.

   3. Before him. Whom? Some say himself, for so they say the Hebrew word
   is to be understood. As if the sense were, if you look to the state and
   presence of the person himself. But I shall pass by that, and take
   notice but of two persons to whom this him may be referred; for the
   scriptures have this privilege, to abound in senses.

   [1.] Him, that is, the Lord, for so may it be referred. He was but
   lately spoken of, ver. 1, The arm of the Lord;' and then it is added,
   Before him shall grow up a tender plant.' Though he was so mean, yet
   God saw it, and permitted it, because he had appointed it. It was not
   by chance, and because it could be no better, but by God's special
   decree and appointment. Before the Lord he shall rise up a tender
   plant.

   [2.] Before him; that is, before the party that believes not the
   report: ver. 1, Who hath believed,' &c.--because before him Christ
   riseth up in such a mean manner. By this him must be meant the
   unbelieving Jews of whom he spake. Reason cannot expect that the
   Messiah should lie hid under so mean a shape. They will be offended in
   Christ's meanness, as I shall touch by and by. Thus for the phrases of
   Christ's original.

   Secondly, For the phrases now that belong to the outward state and
   appearance of his life. Christ hath not in him proportion and beauty,
   which are the objects allurable to men. We love things for the orderly
   disposition of parts or colours; the one is called form or comeliness,
   the other beauty. So that Christ's mean appearance is described two
   ways:--

   1. By the removal of excellency.

   2. By the restraint of affection.

   1. As to the removal of excellency. And therein--

   [1.] No proportion, no form nor comeliness is found in him. Then--

   [2.] As to beauty, there was no fitness of colour. These things are not
   put here literally, to deny there was any individual or personal beauty
   in Christ; for I believe that he was not of a monstrous and misshapen
   body, but well compacted and well coloured,--though I doubt not but
   there have been a great many fictions about the body of Christ,
   particularly what Lentulus says in his letters concerning the
   amiableness of Christ's countenance, that he was of so fair a face, and
   yet of so majestic an eye, that all that beheld him were enforced to
   love and fear him. Nicephorus likewise said that Mary Magdalen, who was
   at first a common strumpet, was drawn to hear Christ upon a report of
   the comeliness of his person, and afterwards won by the efficacy of his
   doctrine. No doubt he had a comely, well-featured, healthy body. But
   this is not spoken of so much as his outward port and presence to the
   world. He did not come with such pomp and glory as they imagined was
   suitable to the majesty of the Messiah. They thought he should have
   come in a royal way, with a great deal of outward pomp and splendour,
   that so all the world might have admired the great Redeemer of the
   Jews.

   But how can it be said of Christ that he had neither comeliness nor
   beauty, since it is said, Ps. xlv. 2, that he is fairer than the
   children of men,' or than the sons of Adam'? And in Cant. v. 10-16, he
   is described by the spouse to be well-coloured, My beloved is white and
   ruddy, the chiefest of ten thousand;' and likewise well-featured, as
   she goeth on from part to part, from head to feet; and then concludeth,
   He is altogether lovely.'

   To this I answer:--

   (1.) It is one thing what Christ is to the spouse, another what he is
   to the unbelieving Jews. Christ's beauties are inward, seen of none but
   those that are inwardly acquainted with him. The spouse speaketh of him
   in a spiritual sense. Here he is spoken of in respect of his outward
   habitude in the world.

   (2.) We must distinguish between Christ's humiliation and exaltation,
   his Godhead and his manhood. In his Godhead; so he is the brightness of
   his Father's glory, and the express image of his person,' Heb. i. 3,
   and consequently full of beauty. In his humiliation; so he is not only
   a man, but a mean man: Phil. ii. 9, He made himself of no reputation.'

   (3.) In Christ's humiliation we must distinguish as to what he is in
   himself and as to what he is in the eye of the world. In Christ's
   manhood he did not appear in the form of God. It is said, Phil. ii. 7,
   He took upon him the form of a servant;' yet he did not lay aside his
   Godhead: that appeared too sometimes in the power of his doctrine and
   miracles; but the world saw no form in him, none of the form of the
   Godhead in him. Then--

   2. As to the phrase that implieth restraint of affection, why we should
   desire him.' But you will say, How then is Christ said to be the desire
   of all nations, as we read, Hag. ii. 7, I will shake all nations, and
   the desire of all nations shall come'?

   I answer--

   [1.] Though he is not actually desired, yet he is nevertheless worthy
   of esteem and affection. Pearls do not lose their worth though swine
   trample upon them. It is the world only that is offended at his
   meanness, and saith, There is no beauty in him wherefore we should
   desire him.' But--

   [2.] You judge by the eye and appearance. Now a carnal heart can see no
   excellency in Christ; and when you see him, if you trust to your sight
   merely, you will not desire him. Thus you have the meaning of the
   words. Now--

   Secondly, To accommodate this prophecy to Christ, and show you how it
   agreeth to him, that so his love may be displayed and held forth to
   your meditations, that he should submit himself to such meanness for
   your sakes. Wherefore I desire that you would with me observe these few
   things. And first from the causal particle: For he shall grow up as a
   tender plant.' He gives a reason why so few believed the report.

   The point therefore is this:--

   Doct. 1. That Christ's meanness, and want of outward pomp and
   splendour, is the great prejudice against the entertainment of him and
   the things of his kingdom.

   In handling this point I shall treat of his meanness both in his life
   and doctrine.

   First, As to his meanness in his manner of revealing himself to the
   world. Because the beginnings of his kingdom were weak, the world
   rejected it. I will prove this by a reason or two.

   1. Because we have no light to see any excellency in other things but
   what are outwardly glorious. Men being inured to such things, think
   them the only things. Corrupt desires make a corrupt mind. Where there
   is flesh, there will be a knowing of things after the flesh, 2 Cor. v.
   16; and we will think such things only to be glorious. Men's judgments
   are as their affections; for as these are, so are their conceits of
   happiness: 1 Cor. ii. 12, We have not received the spirit of the
   world.' There is a spirit of the world which maketh men think that the
   greatest excellency is in the things of the world, as in outward
   fineness, royalty, learning, eloquence, pomp, and splendour. Christ is
   mean, and therefore rejected, because he cometh not with these things.

   2. Because we judge altogether by likelihoods and outward appearances.
   Samuel thought sure that Eliab was the man, because he looked upon his
   countenance and the height of his stature, 1 Sam. xvi. 7; but it is
   added, Man seeth not as God seeth; man looketh to the outward
   appearance.' We judge of things according as they are to our senses.
   Many would have thought that some great emperor should have been the
   Messiah, rather than the poor child in the manger at Bethlehem. Most
   people will have it that truth is rather on that side that is
   accompanied and accommodated with outward authority, applause, and
   other advantages of learning and eminency, than among a few despicable
   men, such as the martyrs were.

   3. Because we envy and despise any worth that is veiled under meanness,
   as if it were a disgrace to us to take anything from those beneath us.
   It was a great condescension in Job, chap. xxxi. 13, that he would not
   despise the cause of his servants when they contended with him.'
   Certain it is otherwise in the world; they consider the person and envy
   the excellency; as you may read, Mat. xiii. 55, &c. Though they were
   astonished at his doctrine, yet they said, Is not this the carpenter's
   son?' and were offended at him. His mean original hindered them from
   giving that due honour and respect that they should.

   Use 1. The use of this may be to inform us:--

   1. Whence it is that Christ is differently entertained in the world,
   which is, because some see nothing but the outward meanness, others the
   inward excellency: Luke ii. 34, This child is set for the fall and
   rising of many in Israel.' Because this child, therefore for the fall
   and rising of many. And therefore he is called a rock of offence and a
   stumbling-stone, Rom. ix. 33. God would not satisfy every one. There
   was inward power in Christ, and outward meanness, and many times he did
   exert and put forth his inward power: 1 Peter ii. 7, To them that
   believe he is precious; but to others a stone of stumbling, and a rock
   of offence.' God will satisfy those that are desirous to learn the
   things of his kingdom; as for others, there is so much outward meanness
   and reproach laid upon his ways, as to harden them against them. If you
   will know the reason why so many are prejudiced against the ways of
   Christ, it is because they see nothing in them worthy of their choice.
   Oh, it is a great mercy of God for any to see the beauty of religion
   through the clouds of meanness, affliction, self-denial, and all those
   troubles to which it engageth men.

   2. Do not despise things for their meanness, for so thou mayest condemn
   the ways of God. God will have his people love him for his own sake,
   not for the outward accommodation and advantages we have by him. As it
   is said, John vi. 26, Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I
   say unto you, ye seek me not because ye saw the miracle, but because ye
   did eat of the loaves and were filled,' Princes try the affections of
   their subjects most when they come to them in a disguise, and veil
   their majesty under the plainest garb; and so did Christ to the world,
   and still does to this day. He suffereth this stumbling-block, to see
   if we will look beyond it. As there was meanness in the outward
   habitude of Christ's person, so there is now in the administration of
   his kingdom; as appears by considering:--

   [1.] That the ordinances are weak to appearance; there is nothing but
   plain words, plain bread and wine, in one ordinance, and only water in
   another. The simple plainness of the ordinances is an obstacle to men's
   believing; they would fain bring in pomp, but that will mar all. When
   there were wooden chalices, there were golden priests. God would have
   his ordinances like himself, simple and full of virtue. The tabernacle
   was all gold within, but covered with badgers' skins without. This
   stumbleth the world at first dash; they will not look for gold where
   they see nothing but badgers' skins: 2 Kings v. 12, Are not Abana and
   Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?'
   What! no greater thing to be done for my health? I might have done thus
   at home. So some are apt to say, We had better read at home, than wait
   upon such plain preaching; but remember, it is God's ordinance, and
   that puts a value upon it.

   [2.] These ordinances are administered by weak men. Many times God
   singleth out the meanest. Our Saviour sent fishermen to conquer the
   world, and made use of a goose-quill to wound Antichrist. Moses, the
   stammering shepherd, was commissioned to deliver Israel; God makes use
   of Amos, who was a herdsman, to declare his will, Amos i. 1. So Elisha
   the great prophet was taken from the plough, 1 Kings xix. 19. And many
   times God made use of young men, such as Paul, whose very person
   causeth prejudice; young Samuel, young Timothy, men of mean, descent,
   low parentage, and of no great appearance in the world.

   [3.] The manner how it is by them managed, which is not in such a
   politic, insinuating way as to beguile and deceive, and as if they were
   to serve their own ends: 2 Cor. i. 12, the apostle saith, Our rejoicing
   is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly
   sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, we have our conversation among
   you.' He calleth it carnal wisdom to use any underhand dealing to gain
   esteem to their way, or to go in any by-path out of Christ's way. They
   did nothing deceitfully and closely, but what they openly held forth.
   And so now the less there is of worldly wisdom, the more God
   prevaileth: Luke xvi. 8, The children of this world are wiser in their
   generation than the children of light.'

   [4.] The persons by whom it is entertained, the poor: James ii. 5, Hath
   not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith?' Usually
   God's true people are the meanest and most contemptible, not being so
   noted for outward excellency as others, Mat. xi. God revealeth the
   things of his kingdom to babes, men destitute of outward sufficiencies.
   This hath been always a great prejudice against Christ's doctrine: John
   vii. 48, Have any of the rulers or the pharisees believed on him?' Have
   the great men, the great scholars, closed with that way?

   [5.] The general drift of it is to make men deny their pleasures, to
   overlook their concernments, to despise the world, to hinder unjust
   gain, to walk contrary to the honorary customs and fashions of the
   world. If men would be Christians indeed, they will find that the usual
   customs of the world are most contrary to Christianity; as to for give
   injuries, to seek reconciliation, to put up with disgrace, and to show
   kindness to those that are not likely to repay us again: Luke xiv.
   12-14, When thou makest a dinner or supper, call not thy friends, nor
   thy brethren, nor thy rich neighbours, lest they bid thee again, and a
   recompense be made unto thee; but call the poor, the blind, and the
   lame, and the maimed, for they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt
   be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.' So to make a man
   contented, though he and his family should be in a mean condition,
   though he be not so great in the world as others; yet this is a great
   prejudice against the ways of Christ. Therefore do not despise persons
   or things for their meanness; do not count zeal folly, or religion
   weakness; do not reckon them among fools that are conscientiously
   scrupulous: Heb. xiii. 2, it is said, that some that entertained
   strangers thereby entertained angels unawares; so some that refuse
   things because of outward appearance, they refuse Christ unawares; they
   may condemn and reproach the very saints and people of God. Luke xvi.
   15: That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the eyes
   of God.' There is no judging by the outward probability and face of
   things. Still true, strict Christianity is disesteemed in the world;
   men look upon it as some humorous, misshapen conceit, that looketh
   enviously upon their pleasures, contrary to their natures, and
   unbefitting their quality. That you may not thus despise the things
   that any way concern the kingdom of Christ for their meanness, I shall
   give you these four directions:--

   (1.) Beg the Spirit of God that he would suggest to you his will and
   counsel in all things. The spirit of the world or your own spirit will
   make you judge amiss, and that nothing is God's but what is outwardly
   glorious; and so even Christ may become a stone of stumbling and a rock
   of offence to you, and you may despise the greatest truth. The things
   of Christ's kingdom are carried in a secret way. The Spirit telleth us
   what things are given us of God. Plain things must be set on by the
   demonstration of the Spirit, or else we shall see no beauty in them: 1
   Cor. ii. 4, A Christian sucketh marrow out of that which is dry bones
   to a natural man. Do not trust to your own reason. Leave a man to his
   reason, to the mere considerations of flesh and blood, and he can
   perceive no beauty in the glorious ways of Christ. This is the cause
   why great scholars are so much mistaken in the things of his kingdom

   (2.) Walk in the ways of God, in his fear and love--keep communion with
   him and he will direct you: Ps. xxv. 13, The secret of the Lord is with
   them that fear him; he will show them his covenant.' God discovereth
   himself particularly to his own people. They are his friends, and you
   know friends reveal themselves mutually to one another in the greatest
   secrets; as Christ giveth the reason: John xv. 15, I have called you
   friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have revealed
   to you.' Those that keep up a continual acquaintance with God, by
   manifesting their love and fear of him, shall have divine mysteries
   manifested to them: Col. i. 26, The mystery that was hid from ages is
   made manifest to the saints.' Truths that have long lain hid through
   many successions and revolutions of ages, are at length made known to
   holy persons. Where there is purity, there is revelation: The pure in
   heart shall see God,' Mat. v. 8. They shall see more of his truth and
   mind in those things which if they should judge of by their own reason,
   they would contemn. So also it is said, Prov. iii. 32, His secret is
   with the righteous.' They have not only other kinds of knowledge, but
   knowledge of the secret of such a way as is veiled with contempt,
   reproach, and unlikelihood to the world. Blind and carnal men sometimes
   stumble upon the despised ways of Christ; but they do but plough with
   the saints' heifer, and light their torch at the altar. Their self-ends
   and by-interests make them borrow from truth; but it is with them as it
   is with parrots, they speak the words of men not of reason but custom;
   they learn a truth when it is delivered, they have been used to such
   notions.

   (3.) Exercise faith; that is, the evidence of things not seen, Heb. xi.
   1; that is, not seen by natural sense or reason. It is o'phthalmos tes
   psuches,--the eye, the discovering part of the soul. As reason is to a
   natural man, so is faith to a godly man. It carrieth a man within the
   veil: what cannot be made out to sense and reason is made out to faith.
   Ideo credo quia est impossibile, therefore I believe, because it is
   impossible. Though, in your own thoughts, you would fain have things
   otherwise, yet, if there be revelation to the contrary, believe it; as
   that there is happiness in sufferings,--that the reproach of Christ is
   better than all the treasures of the world, that there is life in
   death. Faith seeth that easy and plain which is the greatest
   contradiction to reason and sense. See what a riddle St Paul telleth
   you by faith: 2 Cor. vi. 9, 10, As unknown, yet well known; as dying,
   and behold we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet
   always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and
   yet possessing all things.' Faith maketh us see that in a thing which
   reason would tell us were the greatest absurdity and inconsistency in
   the world to believe; as that Abraham should see Christ before he was
   extant. The Jews were ready to stone Christ for saying so: Your father
   Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad.' Faith
   captivates reason to scripture, and maketh a man close with the
   revelation against his own conceits and prejudices. Only take this
   caution,--though faith seeth things impossible and improbable, yet they
   are only such things as are revealed by God.

   (4.) Deny carnal reason and sense; do not judge of divine things by
   outward appearance. Hear what the apostle saith: Eye hath not seen, ear
   hath not heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive,
   what God hath prepared for them that love him'--that is, carnal eyes,
   carnal sense, and carnal thoughts; weighing that place with the
   context, that seemeth to be the meaning. To an ordinary reason, or eye,
   or ear, things would not appear so. Now, because this rule is general,
   I shall a little restrain it by these particulars.

   1. Do not cast away anything of Christ because it is despised or
   discountenanced. Take heed, a saint may suffer under a reproachful
   name. Christ was a despised branch, a root out of a dry ground; and
   Christianity was contemned because of the ill name and common cry
   against it. Most Christians offend in blind zeal; they condemn things
   before they have tried them. Though the censure be right, it is ill in
   thee. Nicodemus suggested good advice: Doth our law judge any man
   before it hear him, and know what he doth?' It was a pharisaical spirit
   to take up a prejudice, and not to be willing to hear what might be
   said for it. It was the misery of the primitive Christians that they
   could not be heard to speak out. Nolentes audire quod auditum damnare
   non possunt--men are unwilling to hear that which they are resolved to
   condemn as soon as heard. It would be confutation enough if men did but
   know the beauty of the ways of religion. It is always this hasty zeal
   which rejecteth things upon public scorn without due trial: examine
   first and then speak. Though it be a despised and unlikely way, it is
   like thou mayest find somewhat of God in it.

   2. Because it is an afflicted way. Afflicted godliness is a great
   prejudice. But remember God never intended that truth should be known
   by pomp, nor condemned or disallowed for the troubles that accompany
   it. The drift of Christianity is to take us off from the hopes and
   fears of the present world; therefore he that liketh Christ and Ms
   promises is not likely to be separated from him by persecution.

   3. Because poor men are of that way, those that have the meanest parts,
   and no outward excellencies: Mat. xi. 26, At that time Jesus answered
   and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because
   thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed
   them unto babes.' The Jesuits have charged it upon the ministers of
   France, that they were poor. So in Salvian's time; Coguntur esse mali,
   ne viles habeantur--men would not be religious, because they would not
   be ranked among poor men. So the Albigenses were called the poor men of
   Lyons. Usually the priests' lips preserve knowledge, but sometimes God
   worketh extra ordinem. A simple laick nonplussed a bishop at the
   council of Nice, and many that were very mean in the world were
   martyrs.

   4. Because thou mayest seem to hazard thy wisdom by closing with it. If
   any man seem to be wise, let him become a fool that he may be wise.'
   Thus I have despatched the first observation, namely, that Christ's
   meanness in his person and kingdom is the great hindrance against the
   entertainment of him; few or none believed. For he shall grow up as a
   tender plant.'

   I come now to insist upon the second point, which is this:--

   Doct. 2, That though Christ's meanness be a great hindrance against the
   entertainment of him, yet, it is by the special appointment of God. He
   shall grow up before him. God orders it that the Messiah should come in
   such a manner. I shall be brief in handling this point. There is
   nothing about Christ but fell under God's decree, and the special care
   of his providence. All the circumstances of his birth, the time, place,
   manner of every action, you have some instance of it. The counsel of
   God brought it to pass, and the scripture was frequently quoted, that
   that might be fulfilled which was spoken concerning him;' yea, the most
   malicious actions of the enemies are spoken of as appointed by God, as
   particularly their spite to him in his death: Him, being delivered by
   the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by
   wicked hands have crucified and slain.' Judas delivered him, Pilate
   delivered him, and God delivered him. For of a truth against thy holy
   child Jesus, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, and the Gentiles, were
   gathered together, to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
   before to be done.' Acts iv. 27, 28. Whom being delivered by the
   counsel of God.' This was God's grand contrivance; here was his
   polupoi?kilos sophi'a, the manifold wisdom of God.' Eph. iii. 10. So St
   Paul calleth the wise disposition of our salvation by Christ: Without
   controversy great is the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the
   flesh.' This was the great mystery. When a man is to make some rare
   engine, he will look to every screw and wheel, that all is set and
   ordered right. Here was God's great masterpiece, in which he would show
   himself, and the great copy of his eternal thoughts. That is the
   reason.

   This point affordeth us many useful considerations, as this decree of
   God may be referred--

   1. To Christ.

   2. To the wicked.

   3. To the godly.

   1. To Christ. God decreed this, and Christ fulfilled it. It is a wonder
   to see how all things did conspire to make Christ conform in every
   thing to God's counsel concerning him. As, for instance, in Augustus
   his decree, which caused Joseph and Mary to go to Bethlehem, where she
   was delivered. It would be too long to give you the history of the
   gospel. Many providences did meet, that all things whatever God had
   decreed might come to pass. Admire therefore the manifold wisdom of God
   in contriving these things.

   2. In respect of the wicked. God appointed this meanness of Christ
   before them. Before them he shall rise up. God punisheth sin by
   occasions of sin. God may be said to harden sinners three ways:--(1.)
   By leaving them to themselves, as it is said, he left the Gentiles to
   their own ways, Acts xiv. 16; (2.) By permitting them to enter into
   them; (3.) By presenting to them such objects from whence their
   corruption taketh occasion to sin, though they were things good in
   themselves; as Jer. vi. 21, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this
   people.' The Jews argue that Christ is not the Messiah, because he did
   not come in such a way as to satisfy all his countrymen. God would have
   Christ mean that all might not believe in him, though not to cause sin,
   but to promote his just judgments. So God's cause and Christ's ways
   have difficulty enough in them to harden them. God pursueth his secret
   judgments upon them. Admire, therefore, and fear God's judgments on the
   wicked. It was by the special appointment of God that it was so mean.

   3. For the godly. God appointed all the meanness of Christ for their
   sakes, for whom it is a double comfort.

   [1.] From the eternity of God's thoughts towards them. Christ from
   before all worlds was appointed to be a captain of salvation through
   many sufferings, and to undergo many hardships for your sakes. This
   length of love is a great refreshment to the spirit; and when the soul
   reflects upon the meanness of Christ as the effect of God's eternal
   thoughts of mercy to it, it is the more encouragement to believe.
   Christ verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but
   manifested in these last times for you.' He would have them established
   in that as a sure truth.

   [2.] It is a comfort to them in their meanness; it is that which is
   appointed. They shall be conformable to their Head in this respect.
   They shall undergo no condition but what God from all eternity had
   decreed for them: Col. i. 24; Paul and all the godly are said to fill
   up what is behind of the sufferings of Christ in their flesh. The
   church and Christ make but one body; that which they suffer, he
   suffers; that which he suffereth, they suffer. The sufferings of the
   godly are appointed as well as Christ's meanness.

   I now proceed to the third observation, namely:--

   Doct. 3. That this meanness of Christ was willingly taken up by him
   both in his birth and life and manner of appearing among men.

   1. In his birth.

   [1.] For the time of it. It was when the royal stock of David was quite
   extinct, and even come so low that Joseph was but a carpenter by
   profession. Is not this the carpenter's son?' And therefore is the
   genealogy of Joseph and Mary so carefully sought out by the evangelist,
   because it was not commonly and publicly known that they were of that
   lineage. The throne of David was occupied by Herod, who was an
   Ascalonite; he was Epi` pho'rois tetagme'nos, rather an observer of the
   tribute than a king.

   [2.] The place, Bethlehem, a small place, not able to make up one
   division in Israel, the least of the thousands of Judah. A man would
   have thought he should have been born in some great city, as Rome or
   Jerusalem. No; but he chose to be born in Bethlehem, and suffered at
   Jerusalem: he had the least place to be born, but the greatest to
   suffer in. And then again, he was not born in any stately room at
   Bethlehem, but in a stable, nay, in a manger in the stable. Christ
   would have all mean at his birth.

   [3.] Consider how in everything he was found in shape like another
   child, being circumcised the eighth day. He submitted to the law as
   soon as he was born into the world, to teach his followers obedience.

   [4.] Consider the oblation that was made for him, such as was made for
   poor people--a pair of turtle-doves and two young pigeons, the poor's
   offering. Those that were not able to bring a lamb were to bring two
   turtles and two young pigeons, and that was accepted for an atonement.
   Thus much for his birth: yet we may observe there was something divine
   still mingled with Christ's outward meanness, as the appearing of the
   star, the trouble of the Jews, the wise men's report and offerings. By
   these things God would leave them without excuse, and under this
   poverty discover some glimpses of the deity.

   2. Now for his life and manner of appearance in the world. He was
   altogether found in fashion as a man, as the apostle saith; that is, to
   outward appearance just as other men, for his growth was as other
   men's, by degrees: And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in
   favour with God and man.' Though he had a most perfect divine soul
   given him at first, yet as he grew in stature he exercised and
   discovered the vigour of his faculties, which is there called
   increasing in knowledge, showing forth in his several ages more degrees
   of knowledge, that in all things he might conform to us. It would be
   too large for me to insist upon everything, therefore briefly take it
   thus:--His life was spent in much toil and labour, going to and fro;
   nay, and probably too, in mean labour, in his father's trade: Mark vi.
   3, Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary?' Not only the
   carpenter's son, but the carpenter. In his younger time he exercised
   that trade, as Justin Martyr, a most ancient historian, whites: he made
   yokes and ploughs. And when he put himself upon the way and duty of his
   ministry, he was in much want and penury; he was an hungry, Mat. iv. 2;
   thirsty, John iv. 6; without house and home: Mat. viii. 20, Foxes have
   holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not
   where to lay his head.' Yea, so poor was he, that he had not wherewith
   to pay his poll-money for his head to the Romans, Mat. xvii. 27;
   therefore Peter is fain to go to the sea and catch a fish. I will not
   touch upon those that especially take in his suffering, that will fall
   in the next verse; only take notice how he was hunted up and down by
   the pharisees, how he was scorned and derided by them, so far as it
   reflects upon his weakness, as Luke xvi. 14, exemukte'rizon,--they blew
   their nose at him in great scorn, as the word may be rendered. Nay,
   when he would show any royalty, and come as a king to Sion, he came
   riding upon the foal of an ass, Mat. xxi. 5.

   Use 1. Oh, then be exhorted--

   1. To admire the love of God, that he should stoop to such a low
   condition for your sakes. Here is a large field for meditation;
   expatiate your thoughts, then, and trace Christ in all the history of
   his life, from the cradle to the grave, from the stable to Golgotha,
   and see what a mean and contemptible life he led.

   2. Faithfully apply it, and say, All this was done for my good. The
   scriptures do not only take notice of Christ's humiliation, but of the
   very end of it. Most read the history of Christ as a man would do a
   romance, to be a little affected with it for a time; they take notice
   what is done, but not why; there is not that faithful appropriation:
   Gal. iv. 4, 5, When the fulness of time was come, God sent his Son,
   made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem us that were under the
   law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.' Mark the end, and
   say, This was done for me; for us is too general. Why was Christ so
   mean? It was that I might be rich: 2 Cor. viii. 9, For ye know the
   grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your
   sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich;' rich
   in grace, and rich in comfort, Ptocho`s, the word signifieth he became
   a beggar, not that he did beg, but he lived in continual need of a
   supply, and would sometimes put forth some glimpses of his divinity to
   command his welcome: Luke xix. 5, Zaccheus, make haste and come down,
   for to-day I must abide at thy house.' Yet I say, Christ put himself
   upon this meanness for our sakes. Speciosus prae filiis hominum,
   obscuratur pro filiis hominum, saith Bernard. It is for our sakes that
   he who is altogether lovely in himself had no form, that we might be
   made lovely and beautiful; he was without comeliness, that his church
   might be comely, without spot or wrinkle, as the apostle speaketh, Eph.
   v. 27. He was besmeared with blood, that the church might be without
   spot. It is good to observe that Christ's meanness was not only in
   judgment, for a stumbling-block to the wicked, but in mercy to the
   godly. If he had discovered his deity at first, he had never suffered,
   and then the work of our redemption had stood still. It is a good
   observation of St Austin, quoted by Aquinas, Dum omnia mirabiliter
   fecit, auferret quod misericorditer fecit--if he had done all things
   wonderfully, he had done nothing mercifully. Christ's meanness, as it
   is a great mercy to mankind, see that it be so to you.

   Use 2. Is information. It informeth us, then:--

   1. That poverty and meanness is not disgraceful. Christ himself was a
   carpenter, Paul a tent-maker, and the apostles fishermen. Christ, you
   see, scorned that glory, pomp, and greatness which the world doteth
   upon. Men look upon the outside as if the horse were the better for the
   trappings, or anything without a man could ennoble him: Prov. xix. 1,
   Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is
   perverse in his lips.' A man is rightly esteemed by his internal
   qualifications. One holy saint is to be preferred above all the rich
   men that abound in the greatest affluence of estate and pomp. It should
   be so with all, much more with the godly. It is a reproach to Christ to
   contemn any man for his poverty, because he is meaner in the world than
   we: Prov. xiv. 31, He that despiseth the poor reproacheth his Maker.'
   Can I believe that ever you would honour Christ, who despise the poor?
   Would you not him too? He that despiseth the poor reproacheth his
   Saviour. It is the most contrary affection to the Christian religion.

   2. It informs us that poverty should not be irksome to us. Christ
   underwent it before you; his apostles were base in the world's eye: 1
   Cor. iv. 13, We are made as the filth of the world, and are the
   offscouring of all things;' counted the scurf of the earth. Christ
   chose this kind of life, a holy meanness, and therefore be not
   troubled. Poverty is a great burden, I confess, and layeth a man open
   to many a disadvantage,--scorn, contempt, and refusal. But consider,
   Christ hath honoured it in his own person, and he honoureth it to this
   very day. If there be any respect of persons with God, he respecteth
   the poor, and reveals most of himself to them: The poor receive the
   gospel.' Mat. xi. 5; I will also leave in the midst of thee an
   afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the
   Lord,' Zeph. iii. 12. God hath provided for the esteem of all his
   servants. What is wanting one way is more plentifully supplied in
   another; so that those that have the least outward esteem, are justly
   accounted the most excellent. Every condition, I confess, hath its
   snares, but poverty hath least. This disposeth the soul to hearken to
   divine things, that their outward defects may be made up in some inward
   excellency. Everything naturally seeketh after a supply of its wants;
   and therefore, as it is in outward things, persons that are themselves
   deformed are most deeply stricken with the love of beauty in others,
   that they may cover their own wants by linking themselves with that
   abundance of perfection that they spy in them; so the godly poor are
   more disposed to hearken to religion, because more sensible of their
   defects, that the meanness of their outward estate may be covered and
   satisfied for by the riches of those graces that are in their souls.
   And indeed, as these are fitter to receive a manifestation, so God doth
   most manifest himself to them: the first report that was made of Christ
   was made to shepherds and poor swains. Therefore on these accounts
   poverty is not so irksome.

   Use 3. Is instruction. It teacheth us divers lessons:--Was Christ both
   in birth and manner of appearance in the world mean? Then--

   1. It teacheth us humility, that he should empty himself of all his
   glory, and live in a mean estate. The apostle sets out this pattern
   excellently: Phil. ii. 6-8, Who, being in the form of God, thought it
   no robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and
   took upon him the form, of a servant, and was made in the likeness of
   men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
   became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.' He divested
   himself of all his royalty, that he might teach us this pattern of
   humility. Most men love to live to the utmost,--in a proud, pompous
   way, and disdaining of others. You see Christ, when he might have
   discovered majesty, held forth nought but poverty. And, indeed, it was
   principally to teach us this lesson: Mat. xi. 29, Learn of me, for I am
   meek, and lowly of heart.' He doth not say, Learn of me, quia potens;
   but, Learn of me, quia humilis sum--not, Learn of me, for I am
   powerful; but, Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly. Christ is not to
   be imitated in his power, but he is to be imitated in his graces. Not,
   Learn of me to do miracles, to create the world; but, to be lowly and
   humble-minded. This is the great pattern and copy that God hath set us,
   to wit, humility.

   2. To be mean and low for Christ, as he was for you. Christ was poor
   that you might be rich--rich in peace, joy, comfort, salvation. Can you
   find such a rare instance as would be poor for Christ that he may be
   rich in his glory, in his ordinances, in the safety of his servants? We
   have read of many that have been poor for their lusts, they have
   prodigally lavished away their estates upon their pleasures; but very
   few have been poor for Christ: Phil. ii. 5; Let the same mind be in you
   that was in Jesus.' The apostle applieth it to humility, and we may
   also to the same purpose. Do you have as bountiful a disposition to God
   as Christ had for you? Can anything be too much for him? If a man truly
   serveth God, he would come as near him as possibly he could. Well,
   Christ cast away his glory for you; do you cast away your riches for
   Christ, not by a vowed poverty, but by a voluntary laying out
   yourselves for his word, his cause, and gospel? It is not waste where
   all is due; and indeed nothing is lost that is laid out upon God: Mat.
   x. 39, He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his
   life for my sake shall find it.' Therefore, if you do, as Ahaz's dial,
   go back ten degrees in your estate or outward pomp, the nearer will you
   come to the pattern. There is one who has quitted more for you than you
   can possibly quit for him. But I shall proceed to the next doctrine.

   Doct. 4. That Christ is so outwardly mean, that the men of the world do
   not any way desire him, or that carnal men do see nothing in Christ
   wherefore they should desire him. To his spouse he is all beauty,
   altogether lovely;' but to them there was no beauty why they should
   desire him.

   The reasons of the point are these:--

   1. Because carnal men neglect the study of Christ; their hearts are so
   taken with the things of sense, and the beauty of the creatures, that
   they do not look any further. We are riot much affected with an unknown
   beauty; things that we know only by a general hearsay do not work upon
   us. Christ must be in our thoughts before, he can be in our desires.
   The Jews looked upon Christ's outside, and therefore minded him no
   further. So men hear of Christ in a slight way; so far as they know him
   by the common noise and report, so far they close with him. But they do
   not see why they should desire him, and slight apprehensions stir up
   but weak affections. The spouse displayeth every part of Christ, to
   work upon her bowels: Cant. v. 10-16, My beloved is white and ruddy,
   the chiefest among ten thousand. His head is as the most fine gold; his
   locks are bushy, and as black as a raven. His eyes are as the eyes of
   doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and finely set. His
   cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers; his lips like lilies,
   dropping sweet-smelling myrrh. His hands are as gold rings, set with
   the beryl; his belly is as bright ivory, overlaid with sapphires; his
   legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold. His
   countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. His mouth, is most
   sweet; yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my
   friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.' The apostle wondereth that the
   Galatians should not obey the truth, when Jesus Christ was evidently
   set forth and crucified among them before their eyes, Gal. iii. 1. It
   was so in the word, but not in their thoughts. Men's hearts are wedded
   to the creatures, and so the breasts of their own roe satisfy them, and
   therefore they do not gaze upon other beauties.

   2. Because they reject Christ; he is not for their turn; nay, he is
   quite contrary to their ends. Carnal men have not all the same ends,
   but they all agree in this, their ends are carnal. Those that would not
   come to the wedding-supper, some had their farm, some their merchandise
   to mind, another had married a wife, and therefore could not come; all
   said, they could not come: Mat. xxii. 5, They all made light of it, and
   went their ways.' So they all despised Jesus Christ. Some wicked men
   make riches their end. Now see what Christ saith: Mat. xix. 24, It is
   easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich
   man to enter into the kingdom of God.' It is by the great power of God
   that a rich man is saved, as it followeth, All things are possible with
   God.' Now Christ is not for a rich man's turn. Christianity furnisheth
   men with precepts, not only against unjust gain, but mere desires of
   gain, or delight in gain. It contains precepts, that the kingdom of God
   is to be sought first, and his righteousness. And we are to look to
   these things from God for an additional supply: Mat. vi. 32, After
   these things do the Gentiles seek.' It is not a Christian but a
   paganish spirit that maketh men so inordinate in the pursuit of gain.
   Then for honour, preferment, or applause, the scripture is peremptory
   against it: John v. 44, How can ye believe, who seek honour one of
   another, and not the honour that cometh from God only?' This pursuing
   of glory, honour, and renown is incompatible with a Christian
   affection. The force of the argument lieth thus: How can those that
   seek honour believe in him that contemneth honour? Only he is fit to
   believe in God that maketh eternal life the end of his desires and
   endeavours, which is called the glory that cometh from God. The like
   argument is used by the apostle: Gal. i. 10, For if I yet pleased men,
   I should not be the servant of Christ.' He did not labour to frame his
   doctrine and life so as might be pleasing and suitable to the
   affections of men. Pride and ambition are the most unsuitable
   affections to religion that can be. There is such an antipathy between
   what God liketh and men like, that it is impossible they should be in
   the same soul. Then for pleasures; there are men that have quit human
   nature, and are so far from desiring Christ, that they do not desire a
   free use of their reason. Reason is not for their turn, and therefore
   certainly religion is not. This is the very affection that is in the
   brute beasts. They have some general object, a sensual good, only they
   differ in the particular modification of the object. Beasts are for
   grass and water, these for meats and drinks. All the use they make of
   their reason is to be more curious than the beasts in their choice; and
   therefore Christ is not for their ends: Strait is the gate and narrow
   is the way that leadeth unto life,' Mat. vii. 13. It is spoken
   specially in opposition to the voluptuous. The ways of God are fenced
   up with thorns to them: Prov. xv. 19, The way of a slothful man is an
   hedge of thorns.' Everything is grievous and troublesome that requireth
   care and diligence. Thus they reject Christ because he is not suitable
   to them. To apply it now.

   Use 1. It serveth for information, to teach us the difference between
   God's people and carnal men. To God's people he is all their desire; to
   carnal persons there is nothing desirable in him. It is good to observe
   their several verdicts of him: 1 Peter ii. 7, To you that believe he is
   precious, but to them that be disobedient, the stone which the builders
   disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of
   stumbling and a rock of offence.' To the world he is base and
   ignominious: Ps. xxii. 6, A worm, and no man, a reproach of men, and
   despised of the people.' To the spouse, glorious and full of
   allurements: Ps. xlv. 2, Thou art fairer than the children of men:
   grace is poured into thy lips.' To the world he appeared deformed and
   contemptible: Isa. lii. 14, Many were astonied at thee; his visage was
   so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men;'
   but quite contrary to the spouse: Cant. v. 10, My beloved is the
   fairest of ten thousand.' The Hebrew word signifieth an ensign-bearer.
   In the world's view there is no form nor comeliness in him; he is
   without beauty. To the spouse he is altogether lovely.' Cant. v. 16.
   Well, then, you see here is the true differencing note between us and
   the men of the world, whether we see anything in Christ why we should
   desire him. And it is both an inclusive and an exclusive mark. Some
   marks are inclusive; that is, if a man find them in him, he may be sure
   he is in Christ; but if not, he is not to determine he is out of
   Christ. As the eminent and vigorous workings of holy graces, they do
   not take in every state of Christianity, they do not take in the
   infancy of grace. Other marks are exclusive; that is thus, they knock
   off the fingers of pretenders, and serve to show a man out of grace,
   but not in. As frequenting of the ordinances, a care of duty; if a man
   doth not these things, he may be sure he is none of God's, though he
   cannot be sure he is of God because he doth them. But now this is a
   mark that is inclusive and exclusive too. It is inclusive, for if your
   desires be to Christ, no doubt he is yours. It is a true mark, and a
   mark that is compatible to the weakness of grace. It is a true mark,
   for God looketh to the heart more than to the duty: Prov. xxiii. 26, My
   son, give me thy heart.' And desires are the chiefest part of that. De
   sires are most genuine and suitable to the judgment and determination
   of the soul. They are a mark in which God's weakest servants may
   comfort themselves. Those that fail in other things are not wanting in
   desires. However they may have many defects in their carnage and in
   their duties, yet they are sure their desires are towards him. If they
   cannot be much in duty, they will be much in their desires and
   valuations of him. Peter, that durst not appeal to his own conscience
   for other things, dareth appeal to God's omnisciency for this: John
   xxi. 17, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.'
   And the people of God often vouch this: Isa. xxvi. 8, The desire of our
   soul is to thy name;' Neh. i. 11, Thy servants who desire to fear thy
   name.' Therefore it is comfortable, and it is convincing too, and
   exclusive. Wicked men feel no desires; they have some slight wishes,
   carnal and weak velleities, but they have no serious desires, nor true
   volitions. Balaam may wish to die the death of the righteous, Num.
   xxiii. 10. So they may desire Christ out of some general conceit of
   happiness; but they do not desire Christ for holiness. So there is no
   beauty in him why we should desire him. They do not desire him as
   seeing any beauty in his ways: John vi. 34, Lord, evermore give us this
   bread.' When Christ said he was the bread of life, those that would not
   come to Christ would fain have the bread of life. Nay, heaven itself is
   not really desired by wicked men; it is true, they may desire it in a
   carnal way, as a Turkish paradise, and such a place of ease and delight
   as the Alcoran sets forth; but not as it is in itself, to enjoy God,
   and Christ, and more grace, and to be more free and undisturbed in
   respect of the prevailing of sin and corruptions. Those that desire
   Christ truly, desire him not for ease (the spirit of the world may do
   that), but from the beauty and excellency they find in him, and in his
   ways. His service is of a high and honourable nature, and therefore
   they desire it. So that you see here is the note of trial, and the main
   difference, viz., a desiring of Christ for the rare beauty and
   perfections that are found in him. Do you, then, try yourselves by this
   note. But that you may not deceive yourselves in this matter, I will
   give you a few notes. I will not speak anything of the cause of
   desires. A high value and price set upon Christ, and a seeing rich
   beauties in him, of that I shall speak in the next verse. I shall only
   treat now of the effects of this desire. If it be earnest and strong
   after him, it will be manifested by these things.

   1. A holy impatiency in the want of Christ. When we strongly desire a
   thing, the heart fainteth under the want of it. Amnon was sick for
   Tamar, 2 Sam. xiii. 1-4. And the spouse was sick of love for Christ,
   Cant. v. 8. The soul languishes with a holy desire of the sense of his
   mercy, with a longing after pardon, and grace, and quickening, and
   life, and what is to be found in Christ. They can find no rest in
   themselves till they do enjoy it: Ps. xlii. 1, As the hart panteth
   after the water brooks, so doth my soul pant after thee, O God.' Thirst
   is the most implacable impression that can be upon the body; the
   creature cannot be quiet till it be quenched. Now, of all creatures the
   hart is most thirsty by nature, and the thirst is mightily increased
   when it is hunted. And mark, it is the she-hart, for so the Seventy
   read it, e e'laphos, The she-hart panteth after the water brooks.'
   Passions in females are stronger than in the males. As the she-hart
   panteth when chased, such a rage of thirst was there in his soul till
   it were satisfied with. God, and refreshed with the comforts of Jesus
   Christ. Search then for such a restless and strong desire; try if there
   be such an ardency and earnestness upon your affections, that nothing
   can satisfy but Christ, that you cannot be quiet till you have him. Was
   your heart never chased into a panting for the water brooks? Some tire
   haunted so by the ghastly apprehensions of God's wrath, that they have
   no ease, no rest. But certainly all that love Christ are chased into a
   panting; they have such a sense of their sins and miseries, that their
   souls are put into an earnest expectation of the mercies of Christ.

   2. A holy indignation. Passions usually serve and accompany one
   another. If there be a holy desire, there will be a holy anger. And
   this is at two things:--

   [1.] At anything that would rival the affection.

   [2.] At what would hinder the enjoyment of the object.

   [1.] At anything that would rival Christ in the affection. There is a
   scorn that anything should come in competition with him, that we should
   have so much as a thought that anything were worthy but Christ: Phil.
   iii. 8, I count all things but loss and dung, that I may win Christ.'
   Any outward excellency in comparison of him is but sku'bala, dog's
   meat. It thinketh the worst name good enough for anything that shall
   come in competition with him. And in such a case gold is not gold, but
   dog's meat--honour is not honour--pleasure is not pleasure--but all is
   dung and dog's meat. You know in a natural way things have their due
   respect from us, till they be compared with what we dearly love and
   prize; then no term is bad enough for them. So here, the soul doth even
   abhor the thought that Christ and other things should be spoken of the
   same day, which otherwise might have fairer respects and valuations
   from the soul. It is worth your observation to see how the saints do
   abominate the thought that anything should be supposed to satisfy them
   without or besides Christ: Ps. iv. 6, There be many that say, Who will
   show us any good? Lord, lift up the light of thy countenance upon us.'
   O Lord, do not think we are of that strain. It is the many, the men of
   the multitude, that think so; they speak as if they would not own such
   an unworthy thought, nor entertain any resolution to prostitute their
   desires to any sensual good. God shall not turn them away so. If they
   should have all things else, it is irksome to them to think they should
   be contented. Te ipsum, Domine, da, quod peto, Domine, da te ipsum; as
   Austin crieth out: Thyself, Lord--thyself, Lord.' They are angry with
   themselves if any pleasing thought should arise any other way, any vain
   conceit, that they should be happy apart from God and Christ. It is an
   excellent saying of one, Taedet gaudere sine te, delectat contristari
   pro te--They had rather mourn for God than delight without him. All
   their comforts are irksome to them if they have not Christ with them.
   Try, then, is there such a zealous indignation against false thoughts
   in your comforts? In what case do you think yourselves? Happy is the
   people that is in such a case.' If that be a thought that is pleasing
   to your minds, it is a good sign.

   [2] Indignation against what hindereth the enjoyment of the object. A
   man is angry with what cometh between him and his desires. If your
   desires be to Christ, you will be angry with your perverse hearts, that
   keep you from him. When a man desireth to sin, he is angry with God
   because he cometh in with his law, and steppeth between us and our
   desires: Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is
   not subject to the law, neither indeed can be.' So when the desires are
   set and bent upon Christ, a man is angry with himself that he is so
   clogged and weighed down with the flesh that he cannot enjoy such full
   communion with him as he desires: 2 Cor. v. 4, For we that are in this
   tabernacle do groan, being burdened.' And David crieth out, Ps. cxx 5,
   Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of
   Kedar!' e paroiki'a, my pilgrimage, is prolonged. They are angry with
   their own base hearts, that still there is such a strangeness between
   them and Christ.

   3. It will cause a holy waiting. Those that desired the coming of the
   Messiah, waited for him; as Simeon: Luke ii. 25, Waiting for the
   consolation of Israel.' Earnest expectation is the formal and most
   proper effect of the desire of anything. Look, as it is said of
   Sisera's mother, Judges v. 28, She looked out at a window and cried
   through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming?' She would
   fain meet with it as far as she could with her eyes. And so it is said,
   Rom. viii. 19, The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
   manifestation of the sons of God,' Apekde'chetai, the creature lifts up
   the head--would fain see the general restoration of all things in the
   world; so the soul lifteth up the heart, it would fain see Christ
   coming to it in this or that ordinance,--with a great deal of longing
   they expect when he will draw their hearts to himself: Ps. cxxx. 6, My
   soul waiteth for thee more than they that watch for the morning; yea,
   more than they that watch for the morning.'

   4. Another effect is a powerful command over the whole man. De sires
   are the most vigorous faculties, they carry the whole soul along with
   them. They will take up your thoughts, time, care, endeavours,
   speeches. Look and you shall observe that a man is so affected in
   earthly things, and, therefore, why not so in heavenly? It is a bad
   sign when there cannot be found the same proportion and care for
   heavenly things as men have for the things of the world. Let us see
   these things a little severally.

   [1.] It will take up your thoughts. Our thoughts will be conversant
   about what we desire. We love to feed upon the sweet of those things
   that we long for,--to enjoy them in our meditations before we really
   and actually enjoy them. Thoughts are the pulses of the heart, you may
   know by them how it beats. When desires are at a high pitch, we shall
   not be able to put off those pleasing imaginations that concern the
   object of these desires. Nay, they will haunt the mind in the time of
   our usual repose and rest: Isa. xxvi. 9, With my soul have I desired
   thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee
   early.' Night and morning, all their mind was upon this, how they
   should get God.

   [2.] It will challenge more of your time and care. When men will make
   bold with God rather than their own occasions, it is a sign they are
   but coldly affected to him. If your desires be to Christ, your care and
   time will be more laid out upon him; you will rather borrow from
   yourselves, your own pleasures and business, than borrow from God. I
   confess a man that is in a particular calling, and is to provide for a
   wife and family, must necessarily spend more time in the world than he
   can in religion; but when he begrudgeth all time to God, or thinketh
   all lost that is spent in duty, it is a sign there is little desire
   after Christ. When we are where we would be, time goeth too fast for
   us; therefore, try how it is with thee in point of religion: Is all too
   much that is spent in duty? If the heart goeth out that way, all will
   be too little. As men's desires are so their time goeth away. Job xxi.
   13, It is said of the wicked, They spend their days in wealth.'
   Voluptuous men do so,--so worldly men, they spend their time in
   business and worldly cares, and are cumbered about much serving. You
   may try your bent by that, how you spend your days.

   J3.] It will put you upon endeavours. Those are true desires that in
   action. Slight wishes after Christ never put us upon a pursuit of him.
   If a man be earnest in a thing, he will try all ways he can to compass
   it; it shall be his earnest business. Men that are slight would fain
   have Christ, but they will not seek him--Vellent, sed nolunt: Prov.
   xxi. 25, The desire of the slothful killeth him, for his hands refuse
   to labour.' The slothful are most full of desires; they would fain have
   things, but they do not labour after them. Now, it is otherwise with
   the children of God. The spouse, that was sick for want of Christ,
   sought him through the streets, though it cost her many a wandering,
   Cant. v. 7. God hath fenced up every excel lent thing with difficulty,
   to see if we think it worth our endeavours.

   Use 2. In the next place it serveth for exhortation, to press you to do
   otherwise than the men of the world do, and to beware of their spirit.
   Men see nothing in Christ why they should desire him, because they
   judge with a carnal spirit. Let not any such black note be found upon
   you: Do you make him the desire of your souls who is deservedly styled
   the desire of all nations.' This exhortation hinteth at three duties:--

   1. Long to get him into your hearts. As all things are to him, let your
   desires be to him: Rom. xi. 36, Of him, and through him, and to him are
   all things;' therefore, all creatures, for it is the law of their
   creation to move towards God, especially for reasonable creatures so to
   do. But particularly by your desires look upon him as summum
   necessarium, as the only chief thing for your souls.

   2. Be careful to keep communion with him. If you have got him, take
   heed you do not lose him again. Remember the fate of the spouse for
   parting with her beloved, and how dearly she paid for it, Cant. v. 6,
   7. Whatever carnal men judge of it, the favour of Christ is worth the
   keeping.

   3. Labour to get more interest in him. Worldly blessings have all this
   lot and fate, that they cloy in the enjoyment. Christ is a mercy of a
   nobler nature; the more you see of his excellency, the more you will
   thirst after him. When a man hath a taste of Christ, he will labour for
   more of him. The great prejudice against him is, that men have never
   had experience of him, Austin saith of himself, in the ninth book of
   his Confessions, chap. i.: That the reason why he was loth to close
   with Christ was, because he was to forego all pleasures, and to deny
   himself in whatever was delightful, and that was very irksome to him.
   But since,' saith he, when once I had tasted Christ, quam suave mihi
   subito factum est carere suavitatibus nugarum! It was the greatest
   delight in the world to abstain from worldly delights.' Christ made
   abundant recompense for them. Oh, how sweet is Christ to those that
   have tried him, and made experience of him! They will not want their
   old delights again. I shall prescribe a few means how you shall bring
   your hearts to desire Christ, to keep him, and to get further interest
   in him:--

   [1.] Consider nothing is a fit object for your desires without Jesus
   Christ. The creatures are beneath you. The desire of the soul is like a
   member of the body out of joint when it is fixed upon a wrong object.
   All things without Christ are either sin or the creatures. To desire
   sin was the cause of the first misery; that is, forbidden fruits. We
   know what that is by sad experience. As to the creatures, to desire
   them for themselves is beneath us: it is, as it were, to sit upon the
   threshold and the door of the gate when we might sit upon the
   throne,--to make that our crown which should be our footstool: Ps.
   viii. 6, it is said, Thou hast put all things under his feet.' God made
   these things to be under our feet; and, therefore, the church is
   described, Rev. xii. 1, to have the moon under her feet. All sublunary
   things are beneath the people of God. I should a little digress from
   the matter in hand, at least vary from my purpose, if I should at large
   discourse of the uncertainty and frailty of the creatures, and show how
   the desires may be lost and wasted upon them, which they cannot be upon
   God; or should I descant upon the unsuitableness of the creatures,
   which cannot give true satisfaction to the soul; but I will only
   conclude this first rule with this: That sin is not to be desired at
   all, and the creatures only in reference to God and Christ, otherwise,
   we sin in the desire or enjoyment of them.

   [2.] Look upon Jesus Christ alone as the only object upon which thy
   affections should be exercised. He hath all the properties in him that
   a lawful desire looketh to, though the world cannot see it. He is an
   excellent good, a necessary good, and one that deserveth the best of
   our desires.

   (1.) Consider he is an excellent good. Whatsoever is an attractive of
   love is to be found in Christ. Oh, display his glorious beauties before
   the soul! There is in him greatness, goodness, glory, mercy, peace,
   comfort, satisfaction: these are the beauties of Christ. Look over all
   the world and see if there be any that can do you so much good as he is
   able or willing to do. Cant. v. 10-16, The spouse describeth her
   beloved as a comely young man, as one of the greatest perfections. It
   would be too large to go over every particular of that description;
   only, in the general, observe that the Spirit of God useth such
   expressions as serve to discover outward beauty, to show us that
   whatever we admire in the creatures is, in a far more eminent degree,
   to be found in God and Christ. I know not how to be particular in this
   large field; only I shall a little single out the name of God to you,
   as it is said, Thy name is as an ointment poured forth; therefore do
   the virgins love thee.' Cant. i. 3. And the desires of God's people are
   always expressed to be towards his name in the scriptures. I shall
   mention two attributes, and pour out the savour of them, and display
   the beauty of them, which shine most gloriously in Jesus Christ;
   namely, his power and his mercy,

   (1st.) His power and might. Christ is spoken of to be the desire of the
   nations, when he gave forth the greatest experiences of his power: Hag.
   ii. 7, I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall
   come.' Who would not desire him that is able to secure him against all
   fears, to keep him in the midst of all dangers, and to comfort him in
   all conditions? If a man would long after any person, he would after
   him that is able to shake the nations and to secure him against the
   common visible fears of mankind. Men run after things for a little
   satisfaction and security, but still this troubleth them; they must
   die, and then all their shifts will not serve the turn: Prov. xi. 7,
   When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish.' Then all his
   desires--wife, children, friends--will not serve the turn, when his
   cold corpse must be laid in the grave. But now Christ is so powerful,
   that he is able to secure us against this fear, to comfort us in death,
   and to raise us when dead.

   (2dly.) His mercy is very great. A man's desire is restrained to things
   many times, which though otherwise allurable, yet he hath no hopes to
   obtain. Now here you may desire and be welcome, for your suit will be
   entertained: Ps. cxi. 8, He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth
   the hungry soul with goodness.' When the soul openeth itself to God, he
   filleth it; the longing soul is satisfied: Rev. xxi. 6, I will give to
   him that is athirst of the water of life freely.' You need not stand
   off upon terms or punctilios; Christ will satisfy your longing freely;
   he hath passed his word: John vi. 37, He that cometh to me, I will in
   no wise cast out.' They may have their comfort hindered and interrupted
   in their own thoughts, but he will in no wise cast them out.

   (2.) Christ is a necessary good. Things may be excellent, yet if they
   be not needful to us, the affections move but faintly after them. Now
   Christ is unum necessarium, the one thing needful. It is not enough to
   choose that which is good, but that which is needful: Luke x. 42, But
   one thing is needful, and Mary hath chosen the better part.' Many
   follow after riches, pleasures, and honours, and outward comforts;
   these may be good in their kind, but they are not needful. What good
   will those things do us to all eternity? There the love of God will
   only stand us in stead. The things of this world, according to that
   usual saying among divines, are temporal in their use, but the
   punishment for the abuse of them is eternal. The most necessary and
   serviceable good to us is Jesus Christ; therefore get the judge to be
   your friend against the assizes.

   (3.) Consider, he hath deserved that our strongest desires should be
   after him, not only as he is the being of beings, and the fountain of
   our lives and mercies, but as he laid down his life for us: John xii.
   32, And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to
   me;' that is, I will do that which shall draw all men's desires to me;
   he will leave such a debt of thankfulness upon them. Though we could
   expect nothing from Christ, yet, by the law of thankfulness, our
   desires are due to him.

   Thirdly, I come now to the third thing propounded, which was to give
   you some practical points and observations that concern man in the
   ordering of his life and conversation. I shall handle but three, and so
   quit this verse.

   1. That God prosecuteth and accomplished his greatest designs by the
   most unlikely and despised means. Jesus Christ, the great Saviour of
   the world, was but a tender plant, which a man would be more apt to
   tread upon and crush, than to cherish.

   2. God cometh in for the deliverance of his people in times of greatest
   despair and unlikelihood. For when the branches of Jesse were dried up,
   and had no verdure, even then sprung up the greatest ornament of that
   stock, although a root out of a dry ground.

   3. Mean beginnings may grow up to great matters and glorious successes.
   Christ, the tender plant, was to be a tall tree, under the shadow of
   whose boughs all the fowls of heaven should lodge.

   I begin with the first:--

   Doct. 1. That God accomplished his greatest designs by the most
   unlikely and despised means. I might trace the way of God's prosecution
   throughout all succession of ages, and show you how this truth is
   verified. He made us out of the dust, and that is contemptible matter.
   And as hath been our creation, so hath been our preservation, even by
   dust, that which we would trample upon rather than admire. But I shall
   rather come to the reasons of it, which are as follow:--

   1. That his glory may more appear. The weakness of the instrument
   directs our thoughts to the power of the supreme worker. {Should things
   work according to the constant tenor of nature, and the order of second
   causes, God might have no glory. We should look upon successes and
   deliverances as coming to us by chance, and not mind the great sway and
   poise by which all things in the world are moved, and carried to their
   proper ends. Therefore God doth some times more eminently put forth his
   hand this way. The weakness of the instrument holdeth forth the glory
   of the first mover and agent. The spirit of providence is discovered by
   it: Zech. iv. 6, Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the
   Lord.' My Spirit; that is, the invisible sway that directeth and
   ordereth all things to their proper uses and effects. God worketh
   sometimes the most eminent glorious things by these weak means, that
   you may not rest on second causes.

   2. That we may not see to the end of his counsels. A man doth not know
   what God will do with despised branches; God worketh in such a way as
   doth not suit with our usual expectations: Isa. xlviii. 7, They are
   created now, and not from the beginning, even before the day when thou
   heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.' The
   things of God's providence are said to be new things, not created of
   old, lest we should say we understood them; deliverance cometh that way
   that we least looked for it. Certainly this is a new thing, it is not
   according to the course of this world. God hath created some things of
   higher value and greater efficacy than others, but they are the old
   things. Notwithstanding, weak things are often made use of by God.
   Should we see a man of a stately presence and comely lineaments and
   proportion, we should straightway cry, This is the anointed of the
   Lord, he is now before him, as Samuel did: 1 Sam. xvi. 7, Here is now
   the person that God will work by;' but it is added there, God seeth not
   as man seeth;' that is, God will not work according to the usual way of
   your expectation. David, the least and the youngest, God chooseth him.
   So again, man thinketh that the eldest son shall advance the family, as
   being the flower of the parents' strength; and by the constant course
   and tenor of nature, the elder proveth the most successful; yet many
   times God appointeth otherwise: Gen. xxv. 23, The elder shall serve the
   younger.' God will not have us look to the end of his counsels, and
   therefore the younger is the most eminent.

   3. That he may declare his displeasure against the pomp of the world.
   God maketh least use of that which we so much adore, outward glory and
   splendour. Most of his glorious instruments have been taken from the
   plough and sheepfold. Christ himself, as I told you, honoured meanness
   in his own person. You may see by Isa. ii. 11-22, that God's great
   design in the latter days is to destroy the pomp of the world, the oaks
   and the cedars, and whatever is lifted up: The day of the Lord of hosts
   shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and every one that is
   lifted up, and he shall be brought low.' God's choice is of the meanest
   and most unlikely things, hereby showing certainly that there is not so
   much as the world thinketh in outward glory, which hath always proved
   unhappy to the church, who, when she enjoyed golden cups, had but
   wooden priests. Though Constantine was a worthy instrument, yet
   Seminatum est venenum in ecclesia--in his time poison was sowed in the
   church.

   4. That he may shame his enemies in their security. When they have to
   deal with those that are unlikely to prevail, they think they shall
   carry all before them, 1 Sam. xvii. 42. The ruddy youth was despised by
   Goliath, and threatened terribly too, that his flesh should be given to
   the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field; but yet he over
   came the giant. The more shame doth God pour upon his enemies by far,
   when they meet with their destruction where they least think of it.
   Abimelech, after he had overcome Shechem, the hold of the god Berith,
   and divers other strongholds, and there was but one fort stood out, had
   his skull broke by a woman with a piece of a millstone, Judges ix. 53.
   God ruineth them most ignominiously. Thus the Almighty goeth to war
   against Pharaoh with flies, and frogs, and lice, Exod. viii., the most
   putrid of all living creatures. The Moabites were put to flight before
   the Israelites by a fancy, to wit, the sun shining upon the water,
   which they thought to be blood. Pope Adrian was choked with a gnat. So
   Judges v. 20, it is said, The stars in their courses (or paths) fought
   against Sisera.' And what was that? Nothing but a little rain and hail,
   as Josephus witnesseth; for as they drew to battle there fell suddenly
   a storm of rain and hail just in their faces, that they could not see;
   and it being on the backs of the Israelites, it drove them on with the
   more fierceness against their enemies. Now by this way God poureth a
   great deal of contempt upon his adversaries.

   5. That he may take off all cause of boasting from the creature, that
   the flesh may not glory in itself. Thus this very reason is urged by
   the apostle, 1 Cor. i. 27-29, God hath chosen the foolish things of the
   world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the
   world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things in the
   world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things
   which are not, to bring to nought things that are, that no flesh should
   glory in his presence.' The things that are nothing in our respect and
   valuation, God honoureth, and uses them as instruments, that we may
   have no cause to boast of our strength or merit. The creatures are apt
   to vaunt when they see there is anything of theirs concurring towards a
   work, though they do in part see God's hand in it: Judges vii. 2, And
   the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many
   for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt
   themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.' It is
   observable that David called twice upon the mighty: Ps. xxix. 1, Give
   unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength.'
   When a people are mighty they are very loth to give the glory and
   strength to God. Therefore God worketh by those that cannot any way
   ascribe it to themselves.

   6. Another reason may be, that God may provide for the esteem of the
   meanest. God hath so tempered his providence, that he will leave no
   cause of contempt and disrespect among us. He casteth honour upon the
   meanest, and those that are not so high in the valuations of men. This
   is the reason of God's various distribution, why he hath made some
   mean, and some glorious, that he might upon times single out some of
   those mean ones to show his power by. Look, as Christ saith of the
   blind man, that he was made blind to fit him for a miracle--John ix. 3,
   That the works of God should be manifest in him'--so some are poor,
   some are unlikely, that the work of God might be made manifest, that he
   might show his power and might and wisdom in working by them. He will
   leave none to scorn and contempt. Despised persons shall be honoured by
   him, when other more glorious persons are laid aside as useless.

   To apply it now. It affordeth divers inferences of duty, suitable to
   our divers cases and conditions.

   1. To keep up the heart in case the means be weak. Take heed, do not
   sink to any base despondency of mind or spirit. Usually when means are
   weak men fly to wicked means, to a base desertion of the cause of God
   that they have undertaken, and yield to every unworthy fear: Isa. viii.
   6, Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go
   softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son.' Shiloah was a little
   stream in Jerusalem. Now rivers are often put for the refreshments and
   accommodations of a place. So that the sense is, they had rather basely
   yield up to Rezin and Remaliah's son than wait upon God, to see what he
   will do with the small forces in Jerusalem. Do not despise the waters
   of Shiloah. It is the greatest honour that can be done to God, if we
   keep up endeavours for him, though we have but weak means and
   encouragements; but then faith is tried, how you can east yourselves
   upon a bare promise.

   2. In ease you have great means, fear them; God usually worketh by the
   most unlikely. The prophet David in the Psalms often expresseth himself
   as full of fears when his armies had been successful and victorious,
   not doubting of God, but himself; doubting lest he provoke him by being
   lifted up with his mercies, as you know in that place, 2 Chron. xxxii.
   25, His heart was lifted up, therefore there was wrath upon him.'
   David, when he had great strength, must needs fall to numbering of the
   people, 2 Sam. xxiv. 11. It is a sad sign of speedy ruin when a people
   reckon and rely upon their strength. The more it is, the less it should
   be in your value and estimation. Asa had an army of six hundred
   thousand, and yet, 2 Chron. xiv. 11, he saith, We have no power.' Get
   it out of your hearts; it is no strength to you unless God go with it.

   3. la case weak means have been successful, give God the glory, and do
   not boast. This is visibly one of God's ends in such providences, that
   we may take notice of his strength. In other instances it is from God,
   but in this most remarkably: as Pharaoh's magicians said, Exod. viii.
   19, This is the finger of God.' There God remarkably discovereth
   himself in such deliverances. We ascribe it to his power, but not to
   his mercy. Therefore our care, as I told you, should be especially that
   we do not ascribe the merit of it to ourselves, as we do ascribe the
   working of it to God: Deut. ix. 4, Speak not thou in thine heart, after
   that the Lord thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For
   my righteousness the Lord hath brought me in to possess this land.'
   Give the Lord the praise. This is our case; our praise should live
   beyond the day of its public solemnisation.

   I proceed to the second point, viz.:--

   Doct. 2. That God cometh in for the deliverance of his people in times
   of greatest despair and unlikelihood. I will give you a few places.
   Zech. xiv. 7, At evening time it shall be light;' that is, sepulcrum
   lucis, it shall break forth when a man would think that all things
   should be enveloped and wrapped up in darkness. So Mat. xxv. 6, At
   midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh,' when all
   slumbered and slept; all expectation was given over. So Luke xviii. 8,
   When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?' All
   things will be at such a desperate pass, that nobody will believe that
   ever he will come. Faith there is taken for a confident expectation of
   good success, not in its whole latitude, as it is falsely
   mis-expounded.

   The reasons are:--

   1. That he may seize upon his enemies suddenly, even steal upon them,
   as Christ did upon the world, when the sixth vial was poured out.
   Christ saith, Rev. xvi. 15, Behold, I come as a thief;' that is, as one
   not expected. So 1 Thes. v. 2, For yourselves know perfectly that the
   day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night;' that is, with
   respect to the suddenness of it. To wicked men it is unexpected.

   2. That he may sufficiently try and exercise the patience and other
   suffering graces of his people: James i. 4, Let patience have its
   perfect work.' It is but a partial patience in a partial calamity. Then
   it is perfect patience when it is thoroughly exercised. So also that he
   may try their faith, whether they will believe in him or no, whether
   they can fetch one contrary out of another: Hosea ii. 15, He hath given
   the valley of Achor for a door of hope.' And so for prayer, and to stir
   up delight in him.

   Use. Do not then give over your dependence upon God in the worst of
   times: Gen. xviii. 14, Is anything too hard for the Lord?' Unbelief
   stumbleth most at God's power; when we cannot see which way we shall be
   helped, then we are apt to doubt. But at such times consider:--

   1. You have no cause to distrust God; though he doth not find means, he
   can create them. The root of Jesse, though there be no branches, it can
   bear a sprig. God, that could make the world out^ of nothing, can
   preserve the church by nothing; you do not know his in visible way of
   working. Believe beyond what you can see. Luther was wont to comfort
   himself, when all supplies failed, with this, that God was alive: Dan.
   ii. 34, A stone cut out without hands, smote the image upon his feet,
   that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.' In the mount of
   the Lord it shall be seen.' It is a spiritual proverb, Gen. xxii. 14:
   in the greatest extremities the Lord will appear, and provide for those
   that commit themselves to him.

   2. You have much ground of confidence: Ps. cii. 13, 14, Thou shalt
   arise and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to favour her, yea, the
   set time, is come: for thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and
   favour the dust thereof.' Now you are in a condition fit for
   deliverance: Deut. xxxii. 36, For the Lord shall judge his people, and
   repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is
   gone, and there is none shut up or left.' God puts his people into such
   a condition in which deliverance will be most welcome, and then he
   bestoweth it upon them. Wait upon him now you are in a condition for
   God to help. When Caligula was angry with Philo, saith he, Now God will
   help, for the emperor is angry.'

   I come now to the last point.

   Doct. 3. That mean beginnings may grow up to great matters and glorious
   successes. This is admirably set forth by the prophet Ezekiel, chap.
   xvii. 22-24, Thus saith the Lord God, I will also take of the highest
   branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top
   of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high
   mountain, and eminent: in the mountain of the height of Israel will I
   plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a
   goodly cedar; and under it shall dwell all fowls of every wing; in the
   shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell And all the trees of
   the field shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree,
   have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made
   the dry tree to flourish: I the Lord have spoken, and have done it.' As
   it was with Christ, so it is many times with his followers; as in many
   instances. Jacob from himself and his staff was multiplied into two
   bands, Gen. xxxii. 10, meaning his company of children and cattle, so
   divided to meet Esau. David was taken from feeding of sheep to feed
   Israel: Ps. lxxviii. 70, 71, He chose David also his servant, and took
   him from the sheepfolds; from following the ewes great with young, he
   brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.'
   Saul, when seeking his father's asses, found a kingdom. Christ's
   kingdom sprang from a small beginning. This might also be shown from
   the great spreading of Satan's kingdom, many times from little matters:
   it is well known that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.' Arius,
   a private priest in Alexandria, drew the whole world after him; as
   Montanus and other heretics might be said to do. We should not
   therefore lay too much on success. So Rev. xii. 3, The dragon drew the
   third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth.'

   The reasons of this in short are these:--

   1. God's sovereignty over us, as we are his creatures; he that hath
   made us, can do what he will with his own.

   2. Because he will keep the world in a continual vicissitude and
   change, some up, some down.

   Use 1. To teach us to look to beginnings: Ps. cxxix. 1, 2, Many a time
   have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: many a time
   have they afflicted me from my youth; yet they have not prevailed
   against me;' Cant. ii. 15, Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that
   spoil the vines.' This is added for abundant caution, to teach the
   church to prevent errors and heresies in the beginnings of them, before
   they spread, and grow strong and incurable; to crush things in the
   beginnings.

   2. To support the hearts of Christians when they first put forth into
   the world: Eccles. iv. 14, For out of prison he cometh to reign.' One
   seed multiplieth into many. Broad rivers come from a small fountain:
   Job viii. 7, Though thy beginning was but small, yet thy latter end
   shall greatly increase.' Men rise like hop-stalks out of the dunghill,
   by the pole of Providence.

   3. To keep men from despairing of public mercies. When the child of
   deliverance hath put forth the hand, it will come to the birth: Zech.
   iv. 10, Who hath despised the day of small things?' Christ was but a
   branch at first.

   4. To encourage those that are weak in grace, Mat. xii. 20. God will
   not despise smoking flax, though it cannot flame: Phil. i. 6, Being
   confident of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you
   will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.' Be humble and thankful
   in admiring God's goodness towards you, saying, as David, Who am I, O
   Lord, and what is my father's house, that thou hast brought me
   hitherto?'
     __________________________________________________________________

THE THIRD VERSE.

   He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted
   with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him: he was despised,
   and we esteemed him not.

   THE prophet proceedeth now to the second scandal and offence that the
   Jews took against Christ, who therefore would not believe the report
   that was made of him. The first was Christ's meanness in his birth and
   life, which we have handled in the second verse. The next is his
   sufferings, and those are either of his life or of his death, which are
   set forth in divers verses following. In this verse the prophet's
   expressions do chiefly hint the sufferings of his life. Here are divers
   phrases which discover the several degrees of Christ's sufferings,
   though I shall not give them to you in the order of the words, because
   the expressions lie scattered here and there. The degrees are these:--

   1. He was not esteemed.

   2. He was actually despised, and became an object of scorn and
   contempt.

   3. He was liable to great miseries; and--

   4. He was continually pestered with them. This is the sum of this
   verse. I will make it out unto you from the phrases, opened as the text
   presenteth them.

   1. He is despised and rejected of men. That which we read rejected of
   men, the Hebrew chadal ishim, signifieth the leaving off of men.' It
   may bear a double interpretation:--

   [1.] That Christ was so extremely mean and miserable that it was
   impossible to be lower as a man. He was the minimum quod sic of a man;
   if he had gone any lower, we must have had some other name for him. In
   this sense it is said, Ps. xxii. 6, I am a worm and no man, a reproach
   of men, and despised of the people.' You must seek for some name for
   him among the worms.

   [2.] The leaving off of men; that is, there men left him, they would
   converse with any other, but not with him. Nobody would deign him
   speech and company; he was least of all. Our interpretation seemeth to
   favour this exposition. There is not much matter which you prefer.

   2. A man of sorrows. A Hebraism to express the height of misery. They
   use the genitive case of the substantive to express the superlative
   degree of anything, as a man of Belial' for a very wicked man; so a
   psalm of degrees,' an excellent psalm. This expression compelleth some
   of the wiser Jews to feign two Messiahs, one that is already come, that
   walketh up and down on the earth under the shape of a beggar, that he
   may satisfy for the sins of the Jews, and is in a great deal of misery.
   The other a glorious king, whom they do as yet expect; that is the
   second expression.

   3. Acquainted with grief. Familiaris morbo, so Tremellius renders
   it--knowing diseases; that is, by his own experience. Disease is put
   for any kind of trouble and molestation, because they are the things
   that are most irksome. For otherwise Christ, though he had many griefs,
   yet he had no diseases, these usually arising out of some intemperance
   or badness of constitution, neither of which agree to Christ. He took
   our personal, not individual infirmities; hunger and thirst he was
   acquainted with, not stone or gout or fever.

   4. And we hid as it were our faces from him, or, as it is in the
   margin, He hid as it were his face from us; the Hebrew will bear both.
   It is either a hiding faces from him or from us. Since the text doth so
   indifferently allow of both these renderings, I shall show you the
   sense of both. He hid his face from us, which the Septuagint follows,
   to` pro'sopon autou. His face was turned away as it were; in modesty
   say some, as if he were ashamed of the meanness of his condition; but
   that is unworthy of Christ. The Chaldee paraphrase seemeth to hint
   another sense, subtraxit vultum majestatis suae--he hid the countenance
   of his divine majesty; that is probable, but doth not thoroughly reach
   the force of the expression. Others thus--he hid his face as a person
   doomed to die, as sentenced persons had their faces covered, or when
   much discountenanced. Thus Haman, when in displeasure with the king,
   Esther vii. 8, it is said his face was covered.' So in great sorrow and
   mourning, Thou shalt cover thy face,' Ezek. xii. 6; or it is more
   properly in shame, or as a token of being unworthy the society of men.
   So it was with the lepers, who by the law were to put a covering upon
   the upper lip, Lev. xiii. 45. It is not difficult to reconcile any of
   these senses with the matter in hand. But let us consider the other
   reading, We hid our faces from him.' This is a natural gesture, and at
   all times signifieth some abomination and withdrawing of the mind from
   a thing; but sometimes it is in one affection, and sometimes in
   another; as--

   [1.] Sometimes in anger; to hate them so as we will not give them a
   look. Thus God is said to hide his face from his church to express his
   anger against their sins.

   [2.] Sometimes in shame. We turn away from them, as rich men do from
   their poor friends; they scorn to give them a look.

   [3.] Sometimes in pity. It is such a sad sight that we dare not look on
   it. I rather prefer that of a scornful shame, being ashamed to follow
   such a poor, mean, miserable man. Thus many now hide their faces from
   Christ, when it is disgraceful to close with him. There is nothing now
   remaineth that is difficult; only it followeth, he was despised and
   looked upon as a man leprous, whose face should be hid; and therefore
   we did not esteem him worthy of our company. The sum of the verse
   amounts to thus much, that Jesus Christ was so miserable in regard of
   his outward face and appearance, that he was looked upon as an abject,
   as a man not fit to be kept company with. I shall only note these two
   things more for explication, because upon them I shall build two
   points, which shall be all I will handle out of this verse.

   1. Some of these expressions set out Christ as indeed he was;

   2. Some, only as he was in the apprehension of men. He was in himself a
   man of sorrows,' but in the eye of man he was a despised and an abject
   person: the one is the cause or the occasion of the other; and the
   prophet so intermingleth these two things in this verse, that the
   phrases may be taken both ways--how Christ was in himself, and how he
   was to men.

   1. As he was in himself: from thence I observe this point:--

   Doct. I. That Christ's appearance in the world, and state of life among
   men, was not only very mean, but very miserable.

   2. From men's judgment of him: upon this account I observe:--

   Doct. 2. That carnal men do not look upon Jesus Christ as worthy of any
   esteem from them.

   I shall begin with the first, viz.:--

   Doct. 1. That Christ's appearance in the world, and state of life among
   men, was not only very mean, but very miserable.

   I shall take the several degrees in the text to make it out unto you.

   1. The lowest step is negative; he was not esteemed.' He had not that
   due respect and value in the world that he might justly look for; and
   it is a misery to be slighted by those to whom we intend the greatest
   good. It was much that they should not own him as some eminent man; it
   was more that they would not give him the respect due to any man, to an
   ordinary prophet: John i. 11, He came to his own, and his own received
   him not.' There is an emphasis in the words his own, those over whom he
   had a special care, and to whom he meant the greatest good. Mark,
   everything else acknowledged Christ, but man would not. The angels
   ushered in his birth, Luke ii. 14. The wind and seas obeyed him, Mat.
   viii. 27. The fish paid his tribute to him, Mat. xvii. 27. The wild
   beasts, when he was in the wilderness, would not touch him, Mark i. 13.
   The Holy Ghost would have us to note it as a special circumstance, that
   he was in the wilderness forty days, and he was with the wild beasts.'
   Nay, the very devils confessed him, Luke viii. 28. The man that had
   many devils fell down before him. and cried out, and with a loud voice
   said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high?'
   Yet man would not own him. They thought any one was more like to be the
   Messiah than he. John, though he never did miracles, nor taught with
   such authority as Christ did, yet they sent an honourable message to
   him, John i. 19. The Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to
   ask him whether he were the Christ or no. Bat now they never sent an
   honourable embassy to Christ, never put him to the question, but only
   in a scoff asked him whether he were the Christ or no. Yet John gave
   them as much ground of distaste as Christ did, freely taxing their
   sins. John was sent to in an honourable way, because he was a priest's
   son, but Christ only a carpenter's son, therefore Christ was not
   esteemed. Anything is enough to prejudice them that are not affected to
   a thing or way. Nay; they not only preferred John before him, though
   famous for no miracles, but even Barabbas before him: John xviii. 40,
   When Pilate said, Will ye that I release unto you the king of the Jews?
   Then cried they all, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas
   was a robber.' Any rather than Christ. They had very little esteem of
   Christ, you see. And this fault is objected to them; indeed, it was a
   great aggravation of their guilt: Acts iii. 14, Ye have denied the Holy
   One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you,' even
   a cruel highwayman before Christ. Esteeming is a relative word, and it
   implieth every one, even the worst of men, to be higher in their
   thoughts than Christ.

   2. As he was not esteemed, so actually he was despised, and became an
   object of scorn and contempt.

   [1.] He was despised and contemned in their thoughts. They looked upon
   him as an abject, the leaving-off or off-scouring of men; they thought
   it was a disgrace for them to converse with him; and therefore
   Nicodemus went to Christ by night, John iii. 2, as being ashamed to be
   seen in his company by day. So John ix. 22, the blind man's parents,
   that had received a great benefit, by him, would make a lie rather than
   own him. It is said, These words spake his parents, because they feared
   the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess
   that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.' They
   thought him unworthy of their company, and therefore every one hid his
   face from him, and would not seem to look that way.

   [2.] In their words they used all kinds of reproaches, they thought no
   name bad enough for him: John viii. 48, Say we not well, that thou art
   a Samaritan, and hast a devil?' There was such a deadly feud between
   the Jews and the Samaritans, that to call a man a Samaritan was the
   greatest disgrace that could be, and the ready way to beget him public
   hatred. Here are two scandals fixed on Christ--a Samaritan, and one
   that hath a devil; the one reflecteth upon his person, the other on his
   doctrine. And that which is worthy of your notice is, that to that of
   his doctrine Christ answereth, but doth not care how they vilified his
   person. In Mat. xi. 19, they call him a glutton, a wine-bibber, and a
   friend of publicans and sinners.' They looked upon him as an object of
   common scorn and hatred. So they accounted him as an enemy to Caesar;
   anything that would make him obnoxious to danger and scorn. They
   likewise called him a deceiver: Mat. xxvii. 63, Sir, we remember that
   that deceiver said, while he was yet alive.' Proud, insulting malice!
   They would not call him by his own name, but as if he had been so
   notoriously guilty, that it was a sufficient description of him to say
   that deceiver.

   [3.] In their general carriage towards him. To any that seemed to own
   him, they showed a great deal of contempt and scorn. Because the blind
   man acknowledged him, they cast him out, or excommunicated him, John
   ix. 34. So John vii. 52, by way of taunt they said, Art thou also of
   Galilee?' But chiefly their behaviour to his person was intolerable,
   and that in the last scene of his life: Mat. xxvi. 68. The rude
   soldiers make him their game, and blinding him, say, Prophesy unto us,
   thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?' So it is prophesied, Mat. xx.
   19, They shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and
   to crucify him.' There is a special emphasis in these words--that he,
   being a Jew, should be delivered over to the Gentiles to be mocked,
   scourged, and crucified. Nothing was more vile and abominable, insomuch
   that they would not come into the place where Pilate sat judging, for
   fear of being contaminated: John xviii. 28, And they themselves went
   not into the judgment-hall, lest they should be defiled.' Therefore it
   was that Pilate went forth to them, for they would not come in. Look,
   as it was an aggravation of David's fault that he made Uriah to be
   slain with the sword of the children of Ammon, 2 Sam. xii. 9, so it was
   of the Jews' contempt, that they should deliver him to the Gentiles to
   be mocked and scourged. Thus you see how he was despised, and looked
   upon as an abject.

   3. A man of sorrows. This noteth the multitude of his afflictions, and
   the greatness of them. He was a man assaulted with all kinds of
   sorrows, and grievously afflicted with them. A man of sorrows, that is.
   a man of miseries; the affection is put for the condition, because they
   left a great impression upon him. All kinds of sorrows he endured for
   our sakes, as scoffs, persecution, contempt, unkindness, miseries,
   hunger, thirst, faintness, and weariness. I might tire you with a woful
   variety of this nature; the scriptures everywhere testify it. Let me
   briefly tell you, that they were as much as might fit him to be a
   mediator; his sufferings are to be measured by his mediatorship; and
   then, they were such as might stand with the holiness of his person.
   Now, these sufferings were the more grievous to him, because his senses
   were most quick and smart; and, therefore, he must needs, above other
   men, have a sensible apprehension of what was done to him. The best
   constitutions have the most vigorous affections; and therefore, it
   could not be but that all these sufferings should leave very dolorous
   impressions upon the spirit of Christ. And, indeed, it is more than
   probable that he was so wasted with them, and they had so dried up the
   moisture and freshness of his countenance, that when he was little
   above thirty they thought him near fifty years of age: John viii. 57,
   Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?' He was
   little above thirty; but griefs blasting his beauty, he might appear
   more aged than he was. Thus you see he was a man of sorrows. I do not
   touch, upon the last scene of his death, the sorrows of his life justly
   give him that character.

   4. Acquainted with grief. It was not only now and then, but it was
   always miserable with him. Acquaintance with a thing or person implieth
   the usualness of it. Now, Christ was acquainted with grief, that is,
   accustomed to it, never freed from it. As soon as he began to live he
   began to suffer. He was exiled, and forced to fly into Egypt as soon as
   he was a month old, and ever afterward hunted up and down by the
   pharisees. Trace him through all the scenes of his life, from the
   cradle to the cross, from the stable to Golgotha, and you shall see
   that grief was his familiar--he had no other companion. It is an
   observation in that letter that Lentulus sent concerning him (if that
   letter be not forged), Visus est flere saepe, ridere nunquam--he was
   often seen to weep, never to laugh, being always acquainted with grief.
   And in regard of those cruel persecutions that did constantly attend
   him, he is called in the title of that psalm that sets out the misery
   of his life, Ps. xxii., The hind of the morning;' see the title, A
   psalm concerning Aijeleth Shahar,' that is, Christ, who was always from
   the very morning hunted and worried by the dogs. He complaineth of it
   in that psalm, ver. 16, The dogs have compassed me.' The dogs hunted
   him in the morning early and betimes. Herod, one of the dogs, as soon
   as he was born, endeavours to murder him. So at the time of Christ's
   death the Holy Ghost giveth us this circumstance: John xviii. 28, That
   they led Christ from Caiaphas unto the judgment-hall, and it was early
   in the morning.' The bloodhounds were up to worry him betimes in the
   morning. Well, you see Christ was acquainted with grief, even early,
   from his first breath to his last gasp, from his lying in the cradle to
   his consummatum est on the cross. Nay, it is very observable, that in
   the short glory of his transfiguration he was not without sorrow, for
   even then he remembered his death to come, as you shall see, Luke ix.
   31; when Moses and Elias appeared to him in glory, They spake of his
   decease, which should be accomplished at Jerusalem.' In the midst of
   his glory he would remember his death. And therefore, you see, well
   might the prophet use the expression acquainted with grief. So much for
   the determination of the point, to prove to you that Christ's state of
   life was so miserable in the world.

   I shall now show you why he was so miserable. Why did he under go all
   these sorrows? It is a profitable question; as the former for our
   meditation, so this for our faith. The causes either respect God or the
   creature.

   First, In respect of God; and so it was:--

   1. That his promises might be fulfilled. God had foretold it so by the
   prophets: Mark ix. 12, It is written of the Son of man, that he must
   suffer many things, and be set at nought.' Now this sentence is nowhere
   in one prophet, but the meaning is. It is the constant drift and result
   of all that is written concerning the Messiah, that he must suffer many
   things, and be counted as nothing; though he alludeth specially to this
   chapter and the 22d Psalm. This was so far from being a scandal against
   Christ, that it rather confirmed him to be the Messiah, for he was just
   such a one as was promised and prophesied of.

   2. That he might declare his obedience to God's decrees and
   appointment. It is said, Heb. v. 8, that He learned obedience by the
   things that he suffered.' He did by experience find what it was to have
   a Father whom he must obey, though otherwise he were every way equal to
   him. But the excellency of his person exempted him not from Buffering;
   for, having taken our debt upon him, his holy life was a part of his
   obedience to his Father, but his sufferings showed a higher degree of
   it, which made him a full and complete mediator. To obey God in the
   ordinary way of our actions is a common lesson to every holy person;
   but Christ's obedience was chiefly tried by his sufferings, because,
   being without sin, he never deserved it. Thus much in respect of God.

   Secondly, In respect of men; and so--

   1. That he might set off his love to us. Usually they are dearer to us
   that have suffered anything for our sakes, than they that have
   otherwise done us good. And therefore Christ, to set off his love,
   spent a miserable thirty-two years and upwards in the world, and
   afterwards died a terrible death; and that not for himself, but for us.
   Some say it was to merit his own glory; but it is not good to divert
   the stream, or any part of it, from that channel in which Christ
   intended it should run: Dan. ix. 26, The Messiah shall be cut off, but
   not for himself.' Christians, all his sufferings were for you.

   2. That he might be a perfect mediator for us. Christ was perfect in
   himself, but he wanted somewhat to make up his office: Heb. ii. 10, It
   behoved the captain of our salvation to be made perfect through
   sufferings;' Heb. v. 8, 9, By the things which he suffered he was made
   perfect.' Christ was perfect in himself, but not perfect in his office;
   he was made perfect as a captain of our salvation when he went through
   those things in which others were to follow him.

   3. That he might be able to comfort his people in the like distresses:
   Heb. ii. 18, For in that he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is
   able to succour them that are tempted.' A man can the better comfort
   others, when he hath had the experience of their miseries in himself.
   Christ knew how sad it was with his own soul when he was acquainted
   with these griefs, and therefore no doubt he is willing and able to
   help you. Experienced men are pitiful; those that have suffered pity
   others when they are in the like case. It is God's charge often to
   Israel, that having been strangers in the land of Egypt, they should
   learn to pity strangers. And certainly whatever is good in the
   creature, is eminently so in Christ. He hath stronger impressions of
   affection and pity than we have. Mark what the apostle saith: Heb. iv.
   15, For we have not an high priest that cannot be touched with the
   feeling of our infirmities, but was in all things tempted as we are,
   yet without sin.' Christ knew how it was with himself. In the like
   experiences and afflictions, therefore, it cannot but work upon his
   bowels, though men's hearts are shut up.

   To apply it now. Out of all that I have spoken to you, you may infer
   much for your instruction.

   1. The matter, what he suffered.

   2. The manner, how he came to suffer.

   3. The reasons and ends why, for our good; so that here are three chief
   lessons for a Christian to learn:--

   Patience and comfort.

   Humility.

   In the end, love.

   It teacheth you patience and comfort. There is a double ground for
   that. Christ went before you, and he did it that he might have
   experience and a fellow-feeling of your case and sufferings. Here is
   the comfort of God's people; they have a high priest that is touched
   with the feeling of their infirmities. Christ's bowels melt over them
   whilst God's hand striketh them. A man may have moral grounds of
   comfort, but here is the true ground, Christ sympathises with us: John
   xviii. 10, The cup which my father hath given me, shall I not drink
   it?' Though it is a bitter cup, yet it is my heavenly Father that hath
   put it into my hands. There is a difference between the strokes of God
   upon the wicked and his own people; strokes upon the wicked come from
   God's hand, but those upon the godly from God's heart. Bear up, then,
   against the greatest crosses. Art thou looked upon as an abject, the
   leaving-off of men? So was Christ, and so are many of God's people: 1
   Cor. iv. 13, We are made as the filth of the world, and are as the
   off-scouring of all things.' The world's filth, worms, not men. Worms
   are bred out of the world's filth.--worms, not men. Worms are bred out
   of the world's filth. Art thou compassed about with losses, affliction
   upon affliction, like waves one in the neck of the other? do men hide
   their faces from thee, or art thou in no repute, no respect with them?
   so was Christ, and Christ knoweth what it is for thee to be in such a
   case. Job heareth of loss upon loss from the Chaldeans, Sabeans, Job i.
   14. It is often repeated, While he was yet speaking, came another and
   said.' So Jer. xxx. 17, Zion, whom no man looketh after.' God's people
   have often become the wagging of the head, but Christ' sufferings teach
   us patience.

   [2.] Humility. Christ taught us this in his meanness, and he teacheth
   it in his sufferings. See the difference between Christ and Adam;
   Christ would be most abject, Adam would be higher than man. The highest
   is become the humblest; our first parents would be as gods, and Christ
   would scarce be as man, even be man's leavings. It is good to learn
   humility from this pattern showed us in the mount, even in Mount
   Calvary; to deny ourselves to set up Christ, as Christ denied himself
   to set up us. Of all things, men cannot endure to cast their crowns at
   the Lamb's feet--I mean, to sacrifice their glory and esteem to Christ,
   or to be nothing that he may be all in all. Pride is like the heart,
   first living and last dying in a man: 3 John 9, Diotrephes loved to
   have the pre-eminence.' Some are all for precedency, they would be
   preferred before others. You see Christ is otherwise. He freely
   submitted himself to the most abject condition. Thus it teacheth us
   humility.

   [3.] Considering the end,--his love. All this was for you. Oh., what
   will you do for God again? Christians should blow up the fire of love
   by these thoughts. How are we wrought upon by every petty kindness that
   passeth between man and man! How much more, then, should the
   consideration of what Christ hath done and suffered endear him to us?
   And this was done for our sakes. Let it melt our hearts, and draw them
   out in love to God again.

   I proceed now to the second point.

   Doct. 2. That carnal men do not look upon Jesus Christ as worthy of any
   esteem from them. Christ was mean and miserable, and therefore the
   world esteemed him not, but despised him rather, and looked upon him as
   an abject, unfit for their converse and society.

   I shall give you a few reasons for it.

   1. Because they look altogether upon the dark part (as I may speak) of
   Jesus Christ; they do not consider the light and the more glorious
   part. In sins they look altogether upon the light part, and not upon
   the dark--the pleasures of sin, and not the cross and shame that
   attends them. Now, taking into their thoughts Christ's worst, and sin's
   best part, no wonder if they miscarry in their judgments. They look
   upon the world's pomp, but not the world's vanity; upon the pleasures
   of sin, but not upon the shame and horror that accompany them.
   Therefore it is said, Prov. v. 3, 4, The lips of a strange woman drop
   as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil; but her end is
   bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.' Men think to
   swallow the honey, but do not think of the wormwood. Things are to be
   esteemed as they prove in the end. Heathens had some light into this
   truth, that no man is happy till the end, till they try how things
   prove with them. Things are better known in their departure than in
   their coming; the sting is in the tail, and therefore you shall see it
   is said, Deut. xxxii. 29, Oh, that they were wise, that they would
   understand this, that they would consider their latter end.' That is
   wisdom, not to look upon things as they are at present, but what they
   will prove at the latter end--how we shall find them upon trial. But
   with Christ they deal otherwise; they look upon Christianity as a hard,
   laborious thing. Many sad fears they have; a great deal of duty to be
   performed; much care, much toil, and much grief attends it; with many
   other inconveniences. But they do not look upon the sweet of all this:
   Rom. vi. 22, But now being made free from sin, and become the servants
   of God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting
   life.' There is a good end. Carnal men tiling it a hard saying to part
   with pleasures, profits, honour, esteem, to part with all for Christ,
   and to expect nothing in this world but grief, and sorrow, and care.
   This is sad. Christ is not esteemed, because they look upon him with
   such an unequal, unfaithful eye. We are willing to stumble at his
   meanness, but will not reflect upon his excellency.

   2. Because carnal men want that which should set off Christ to them as
   an object fit to be esteemed; and that is two things--the Spirit's
   discovery, and faith's eye; the one to reveal the object, the other to
   apprehend it.

   [1.] They want the Spirit's discovery. A man cannot see the sun without
   its own light; no more can you see Jesus Christ in his beauty without
   the Spirit of Christ. Reports and education may do much, but it is the
   Spirit that sets forth Jesus Christ as a worthy object. What is the
   reason that many that know Christ and profess him, yet cannot esteem
   him? The Spirit hath not convinced them of the worth that is in him. A
   man may be convinced of the truth of a thing, but not practically
   convinced of the worth of it. And flesh and blood doth not reveal that
   to us,' as Christ said to Peter. The reason why Christ is valued by his
   own people is because he hath discovered much of himself to them.

   [2.] They want the eye of faith, and that is the discovering part of
   the soul, that showeth much of Christ to it. Till we have faith we
   judge by sense and carnal reason, and then no wonder if we turn away
   from him. Faith is the evidence of things not seen.' Heb. xi. 1. It
   carrieth the soul within the veil, and showeth unto us better things,
   and maketh them present in the heart through hope and the promises.
   Faith and the Spirit discover a world of satisfaction, sweetness,
   glory, excellency, and beauty in Christ. There are large discoveries of
   God's love and purposes, and what he will do for his people.

   3. There are perverse inclinations in the heart that carry the soul
   another way. Men look upon everything as it cometh dyed in the colour
   of their own affections. Here is the great depravation of nature since
   the fall, that those things which should follow guide and sit at the
   stern; vile affections besot the judgment: Rom. i. 26, with 28, God
   gave them up to vile affections;' and presently afterwards, He gave
   them over to a reprobate mind.' Men are so injudicious, because they
   consult with their affections. Now they cannot make a right judgment.
   It is true, things should be desired and loved as the judgment
   propounds them to be good and true; but now, in the disorder of nature,
   it is otherwise. We let our desires get the start of us, and therefore
   men do not esteem Christ, because he is so opposite to the chief object
   of their desires. A worthy thought of Christ would exasperate our base
   affections that are carried to other things. Hear what the apostle
   saith: Rom. viii. 5, They that are after the flesh do mind the things
   of the flesh.' They mind only those things, they only savour and relish
   them.

   4. Because they do not know what it is to want Christ. Men make other
   things serve instead of him, and therefore they do not care for Christ.
   Now when the soul looks upon the insufficiency of all things else to
   give rest and quiet to it, then it will prize him. When a man extremely
   wants a thing, nothing will satisfy him until he obtain it. As Abraham,
   for want of a child, though he had much, yet he crieth out, What wilt
   thou give me, since I go childless?' Such is the language of the
   soul--What is all this, since I have not Christ? Sampson his victory
   could do him no good when he had no water to quench his thirst: Judges
   xv. 19, Thou hast given me a deliverance, and now I shall die for
   thirst.' Thus carnal men have other things, but they shall die and be
   damned for want of Christ. If men were brought to this, to see that
   there were satisfaction nowhere else for them, they would value him.

   5. They do not know what it is to have an interest in Christ; they
   never had experience of him. Here is the difference between Christ and
   other comforts: The more experience we have had of them, the less
   satisfaction we perceive to be in them; but the more experience we have
   of Christ, the more we desire to have. Taste Christ once, and there
   will be no room left for any other desire. Though you Want other
   things, this maketh amends for all. As Austin crieth out, Quam suave
   mihi subito factum est carere suavitatibus nugarum! A man may be weary
   of other comforts, of the greatest comfort of life, but you never heard
   of any that complained they had too much love for Christ. Men are
   easily prejudiced against Christ that never tried him. They that
   familiarly conversed with him among the Jews, they saw his miracles,
   the others saw only his meanness.

   Object. But you will say, Do not carnal persons think Jesus Christ
   worthy of any esteem from them? How is it, then, that they think and
   speak so honourably of him, and count it a dishonour to them not to
   profess him? A Turk, or a Jew, or a pagan, they are terms of reproach
   among us.

   Ans. To solve this doubt I shall show you--

   1. Affirmatively, in what manner they do esteem him.

   2. Negatively, how they do not esteem him.

   1. Affirmatively, how they may esteem him.

   [1.] Hypocritically in their words: Titus i. 16, They profess they know
   Christ, but in works they deny him.' It is not what a man speaketh out
   of a little traditional knowledge. A man's carriage is the best measure
   of his esteem. When the judgment determineth aright, the conversation
   is proportionable in some measure; that followeth ultimum dictamen, the
   last determination of the heart. Men may thus profess they know Christ,
   and value him, who live in a habitual neglect of what he commands, and
   indulge and allow themselves in a continual practice of what he hath
   forbidden.

   [2.] Indefinitely they may esteem him, that is, in some nice and bare
   speculations, when they do not look upon him as commanding what is
   contrary to their carnal desires; they consider Christ in an indefinite
   way, not such a person as he is set forth in the word. Speculative
   truths and general apprehensions do not thwart our corrupt desires. A
   man may love Christ in general, but not in a particular way.

   [3.] They may have some partial esteem for him, as conceiving him to be
   able to bring them to happiness: John vi. 34, Lord, evermore give us
   this bread.' And with Balaam they may wish, Oh that I might die the
   death of the righteous, and that my last end may be like his.' They
   would esteem Christ were it not for his hard terms of duty and
   obedience.

   [4.] Customarily, in a traditional way. They esteem Christ so far as he
   is commonly esteemed of in the world. If anything recede from the
   general form and usual rate of duties, it is base in their eyes, not
   being honoured with the common custom and practice of men. Carnal
   professors will despise others that do more than they. Singing of
   psalms, repeating of sermons, Christian conference, these meet with a
   scoff from them. Men of Michal's spirit will scoff at what is more than
   ordinary, as she did at David when he danced before the ark: 2 Sam. vi.
   20, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day!' But David replieth, If
   this be to be vile, I will be yet more vile.'

   2. Negatively, how they do not esteem Christ.

   [1.] They do not esteem all of Christ.

   [2.] Nor always. These two will somewhat clear it.

   [1.] They do not esteem all of Christ. If Christ be truly precious to
   the soul, then all of Christ must be precious; not only his name, and
   offices, and sufferings, but also his ordinances, ministers, members,
   and government. You must esteem every one of these. Many esteem Christ
   in one thing, but not in another; they may delight in his mercy, but
   not in his holiness; they may love him as a priest to die tor them, but
   not as a king to rule over them; they will not submit to the laws of
   his kingdom; they find no sweetness in his ordinances; they despise his
   servants, they do not love a whole Christ. It is a fancy of their own
   making; they think they esteem Christ, but they esteem him not as he
   hath set forth himself in his word.

   [2.] They do not esteem him always, nor at all times. It appeareth
   plainly that Christ is set at nought by them in times of outward or
   inward opposition. Our esteem is shown when it cometh to these cases.

   (1st.) In time of outward opposition; when the profession of Christ is
   oppugned, they lay it down, they do not think him worthy the suffering
   for. Most men esteem Christ because of the common countenance that is
   given to his ways in a state or kingdom, and therefore do they so often
   vary. The same men that were Protestants in King Edward's days were
   Papists in Queen Mary's, and Protest ants again in Queen Elizabeth's.
   England hath been often used to these changes. Men look to the public
   favour that is given to the ways of Christ, and so join with them; but
   in times of disgrace and opposition they hide their faces from him,
   they will not own him.

   (2dly.) In time of inward opposition; they assent to the goodness of
   Christ in the general, till it conies to a particular trial between him
   and their lusts. When Christ cometh in competition with their sensual
   pleasure, and honour, and estimation, then is he set at nought by them.
   They did not esteem him upon these terms, to part with their lusts for
   him. So much for the doctrinal part.

   Use is for information, to give us the difference between carnal men
   and the people of God. Christ is an abject to the one, and a jewel to
   the other. It is good to observe this difference of esteem and
   valuation, and therefore I shall discover it on both sides.

   1. I shall show you how the wicked show themselves to disesteem Christ.

   2. How the godly manifest their esteem to him.

   1. How the wicked show themselves to disesteem Christ.

   [1.] They prefer every base lust, the satisfaction of every sinful
   motion, before him. What care they for obeying Christ, so they may
   satisfy their present corrupt desires? It is said, Heb. xii. 16, that
   Esau' (that profane person, as the Spirit of God brandeth him) for one
   morsel of meat sold his birthright.' The birthright among the
   patriarchs was a pawn of the blessing of being heir of the promise. Now
   he esteemed the satisfaction of his sensual desires more than his
   spiritual prerogative; like another profane person that said he would
   not lose his portion in Paris for his portion in paradise. The Jews
   would rather have Barabbas delivered to them than Christ. They chose
   the vile pleasures of sin, or the vain things of the world, rather than
   the sure mercies of David. These the apostle describes to be, 2 Tim.
   in. 4, Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.' They prefer a
   little contemptible pleasure before Christ. They venture their souls
   for a minute's pleasure, for one dram or taste of it.

   [2.] They prefer the pleasing of carnal men before him. They can rather
   deny the motions of Christ's Spirit than the importunate solicitations
   of a wicked friend. Many that are not allured into the tents of Shem
   are easily drawn into sin. The most easy facile natures and
   dispositions are hard enough to be wrought upon to any good, but they
   are easily drawn to sin, and to continue wilful and stubborn to Christ.
   It is said, Prov. vii. 22, He goeth after her straightway, as an ox
   goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks.'
   Whereas a godly man saith as Joseph, How can I do this great
   wickedness, and sin against God?' They cannot so readily comply;
   others,--they will rather lose their souls than leave their wicked
   company; they cannot say nay to a solicitation that pleaseth the lust.

   [3.] They are so far from esteeming Christ, that they think he will be
   a disgrace to them, and therefore they are ashamed to be joined to him
   in a more strict and holy way, especially if they be great in the
   world. They think to be religious is beneath them. Nicodemus, being a
   rabbi, was ashamed to come to Christ before he was converted; but
   afterwards this Nicodemus spake boldly for him: John vii. 51,
   Nicodemus, that came to Jesus by night, spake boldly, Doth our law
   judge any man before it hear him?' There is a base disposition in men;
   they think religion a disgrace, and that it is an abasement to them to
   stand publicly for the ways of God, to vary from the customs of the
   world, to begin holy conference, to do something beyond the general
   tenor and frame of profession in the world.

   2. For the godly; they manifest their esteem of Christ divers ways.

   [1.] By labouring after communion with him with all care and diligence,
   and earnestness of desire. Oh, how they prize communion with him! Thy
   loves are better than wine.' Cant. i. 2; Thy loving-kindness is better
   than life,' Ps. lxiii. 3. They would rather have some intimations from
   God of his love, than life, and comfort, and honour.

   [2.] By rejoicing in him when they have at any time found him: Cant. i.
   4, The king hath brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and
   rejoice in thee;' that the king should give them any closet-mercies,
   and the sweet solaces of his chamber: Isa. lxi. 10, My soul shall be
   joyful in God, for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation.'

   [3.] By prizing those things where they find most of Christ, viz., his
   ordinances and servants, judging they are the excellent ones of the
   earth: Ps. xvi. 3, and Ps. xxvii. 4, One thing have I desired of the
   Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
   all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to in
   quire in his temple.'

   [4.] By their boldness in professing him. A man that is ashamed of his
   religion dishonoureth it: Heb. xi. 16, They declared plainly that they
   sought a country, that is an heavenly.' And St Paul saith, Rom. i. 16,
   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.' Nature brands evil with
   shame. They conceive more honourably of Christ's ways, than to be
   afraid to be seen in them.

   [5.] By seeking his honour and praise more than their own concernments.
   It is enough if Christ be exalted. They would fain have him exalted not
   only in their own hearts, but in the kingdom also where they live. Men
   desire that what they esteem should be publicly advanced: Ps. xiv. 7,
   Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When will the
   Lord bring back the captivity of his people?'

   [6.] By avoiding all means whereby Christ may be dishonoured and
   disesteemed. They would have Christ held forth in their hearts, and in
   their ways. Christians are often pressed to live to the glory of God:
   Mat. v. 16, Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
   good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven;' 1 Peter li. 12,
   Having your conversations honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they
   speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which
   they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.' One of their
   questions will be, Shall I not dishonour God by this? Nathan, when he
   came to David, telleth him he had made the name of God to be
   blasphemed: 2 Sam. xii. 13, Nathan said unto David, The Lord also hath
   put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. Howbeit, because by this deed
   thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme,
   the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.'

   [7.] By accounting those things which are dishonourable in the world to
   be honourable with Christ, such as reproaches and afflictions. It is
   said, Acts v. 41, They departed from the council, rejoicing that they
   were counted worthy to suffer for his name.' So St Paul saith, Acts
   xxviii. 20, For the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.' He
   holds it up in triumph.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE FOURTH VERSE.

   Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did
   esteem Mm stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

   THE prophet having given you the meanness of Christ's birth, and the
   manner of his appearing in the world, beginneth now to draw towards his
   death and passion, and in this verse entereth upon it, and doth not
   barely describe Christ's agonies and fears, but showeth the cause of
   it, confuting the folly of the Jews, who rejected Christ because he
   came under this disguise of meanness and sufferings, by showing it was
   for their sakes: Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our
   sorrows.'

   This text is the rather to be prized, because as it is a clear
   conviction against the Jews, so it is a ground of all consolation to
   Christians. It is a clear demonstration against the Jews; they could
   never elude it, insomuch that when Luther urged this place to them,
   they had but this poor shift, that certainly the people of the Jews did
   not deserve these plagues and therefore the Messiah needed not to take
   them away; or if they did deserve them, it was because they did not
   persecute Christ enough, the pretended Messiah. Thus it is usual with
   people to have an ill apprehension of their miseries. But other Jews
   left all upon the reading of this chapter; and being asked why? they
   answered, God was stricken and smitten, they could never put by that,
   they said. And it is the ground of all consolation to Christians.
   Luther said all St Paul's epistles were so, and those floods of
   consolation flowed out of this fountain: He hath borne our griefs, and
   carried our sorrows.'

   Therefore, let us a little look upon it. The parts are two:--

   1. Christ's love.

   2. Man's unthankfulness.

   1. Christ's love, which is set forth in that clause, Surely he hath
   borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.' And there consider--

   [1.] The certainty of what is averred of Christ: surely.

   [2.] The acts of Christ's obedience, set forth in two words: he hath
   borne, he hath carried.

   [3.] The objects: they are griefs, sorrows.

   2. Man's unthankfulness, in censuring Christ and despising him; and
   there consider--

   [1.] The persons: we.

   [2.] The guilt: esteeming Christ stricken and smitten of God. These are
   the parts; and that I may open them, I shall go over them in a short
   comment and explication, and then clear a doubt about the quoting of
   these words by St Matthew. I shall first go over the words.

   Surely. To note--(1.) The reality of the thing in regard of Christ's
   suffering, it was verily and really done. (2.) To note the truth of the
   proposition; this is a true proposition. Christ hath borne our griefs;
   he bore them, and it is true that he bore them really. And then for the
   acts, he bore and carried. They note a susception or taking up of
   things to put them upon our backs. And then the objects, our griefs,
   our sorrows. The first word signifieth sicknesses, the last wounds. The
   one importeth the sin, the other the punishment of sin. The Septuagint
   translates it, outos ta`s amarti`as emon phe'rei kai` peri` emon
   odunatai--he beareth our sins, and is pained for our sakes. Then the
   specification of the object, our sins, our griefs. It implieth, first,
   that it is for our sakes he endured these sicknesses and sorrows for
   us. Secondly, He not only bore pains for our sakes, but the pains that
   we should have endured, or at least equivalent to what we should have
   borne and carried, if we had suffered for sin. And it implieth not only
   the cause of suffering, but the quality of suffering. So much for the
   first part.

   2. For man's unthankfulness, yea, evil requital of Christ's love. For
   here is first something implied, an unworthy refusal of him for our
   saviour: yet we. Secondly, The ground of this refusal, expressed upon a
   false supposition or surmise, that all these calamities came upon him
   by the just judgment of God: we esteemed him stricken and smitten of
   God. Some read quasi leprosum--stricken with a leprosy. Leprosy was
   esteemed among the Jews as the greatest expression of God's anger. They
   looked upon him as in the state of leprosy, as if he had the
   expressions of God's anger upon him. And then as for smitten of God and
   afflicted. Expressions are heaped up one upon another, to show the
   height of Christ's sufferings, and their malice. He suffered much, and
   they looked upon him as having all the expressions of God's anger:
   Stricken, smitten, afflicted.'

   But you will say, Was not this true? was he not stricken and afflicted
   by God?

   I answer--True, but not in their sense; they did not look upon
   themselves stricken and smitten by God in him. For the matter of the
   censure, it was right, but for the form and manner of application to
   Christ, it is wrong.

   But now to answer one objection to the whole, and I have done with the
   explication.

   If this be the meaning of the words, how cometh it then to be quoted by
   Matthew in another sense? Mat. viii. 17, That it might be fulfilled
   which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our
   infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.' Where it is applied to the
   healing of corporal and bodily diseases.

   This is a doubt fit to be solved, and I shall answer it.

   1. Some think, and, for aught I see, Junius is in the number, that this
   place is to be meant of bodily diseases, as if it were an argument only
   brought to prove that Christ was the Messiah by the power he exerted in
   curing those diseases; and that this bearing and carrying intimated no
   more than the bare taking them away. But if it be properly to be
   understood of diseases, how will the last clause agree? for it is
   nonsense to think he was stricken and smitten of God because he took
   away diseases.

   2. Others therefore think that the proper and literal sense is
   concerning the bearing and taking away of sins and punishments, though
   in an accommodative sense it has respect to diseases bodily. But how is
   it said then, that it might be fulfilled,' which is a note of
   difference when a text is quoted for the thing contained in it, or the
   words alluded to in it? Therefore--

   3. What is to be done then? I answer--We must distinguish of the sense
   of a place. There is the proper and full sense, and the less principal,
   secondary, and subordinate sense. So it may be applied to diseases,
   which was some kind of representation of his great love in taking away
   our sins, and is virtually so in this place, because sicknesses are the
   effects of sin at least. And this action of Christ's taking away
   diseases, was a type of his taking away sin. Now, Matthew applieth that
   to the sign, which did more fully agree to the thing itself and the
   truth signified. And observe this, for the clearing of this and other
   scriptures: as the patriarchs in their actions, and in what they did,
   were types of Christ, so Christ's own actions were in a manner types of
   what he himself would more principally do, as casting out of devils,
   dispossessing of Satan, healing the sick; and so the prophecy was
   fulfilled in the type: and it was a taste of Christ's love when he
   cured the sick and healed every disease. And so upon the cross, when he
   bare our sins, and suffered for them; as it is quoted by Peter r who
   expressly followeth the Septuagint's translation of this place, saying,
   1 Peter ii. 24, Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the
   tree.' Now the words being explained, I shall give you several brief
   notes upon them; for if I should speak largely, I shall prevent myself
   in the chapter. (1.) From that deep assertion with which this truth is
   proposed, surely, look upon it, it is a sure thing: this is a true
   proposition, that Christ did bear our sins and carry our griefs; it
   noteth the truth of the thing, and the unquestionableness of it: this
   surely chiefly relateth to that our sins; though it is to the whole
   sentence, yet to that emphatically. The note then is this:--

   Doct. 1. That it is a most unquestionable truth that Jesus Christ
   suffered for our sins. As the centurion said, Mat. xxvii. 54, Truly
   this was a just man, and the Son of God.' They had some tremulous
   consent before, but then he puts it out of question: truly it was so,
   he was some great man. But to prove it, take that place: 1 Tim. i. 15,
   This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners.' It is a sure thing, an
   unquestionable truth. So the gospel of salvation is a word of truth,
   Eph. i. 13. In regard of its effects, it is called there the gospel of
   salvation; in regard of its property, the word of truth.

   I shall prove it to you a little by parts.

   1. It is an unquestionable truth against the Jews that he did not die
   for his own sins, for to those the prophet chiefly speaketh: and I
   should not be faithful to the text if I did not hint it. John viii. 46,
   Christ maketh this challenge, Which of you convinceth me of sin?' not,
   Who can lay anything to my charge? For they were ready to lay anything
   to his charge, and to object against him as a traitor, deceiver,
   glutton, demoniac, what not; but they could not make it good, nor
   convince him of it. Nay, it is worth the observation, that God would
   not surfer him to be condemned till Pilate had solemnly acquitted him
   thrice by his own mouth. See it in one chapter, Luke xxiii. 4, He saith
   to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man;'
   and again, ver. 14, Pilate said to the chief priests, and the rulers,
   and the people altogether, I have examined him before you, and have
   found no fault in him touching those things whereof ye accuse him;' and
   in ver. 22, And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath
   he done? I have found no cause of death in him.' And there was nothing
   but popular tumult, and a confused noise of voices, Crucify him,
   crucify him,' but no cause specified. Just as Tertullian saith of the
   old Christians, Suo jure nos inimicum vulgus invadit lapidibus et
   incendiis--when they were dismissed from the judges, the common people
   would tear them in pieces, but they could assign no cause. Therefore,
   surely he hath borne our griefs.' As in the place before quoted, the
   centurion and they that were with him, when they saw the earthquake,
   and those things that were done, were forced to testify his innocence,
   Surely this was some hero, some man highly favoured by the gods.

   2. It is an unquestionable truth that he died for our sins, in that--

   [1.] It is the sum of all truth: 2 Cor. i. 20, For all the promises of
   God are in him yea, and in him Amen.' It is called a more sure word of
   prophecy,' 2 Peter i. 19. That part of the prophets that concerned
   Christ was more sure than all revelations and voices.

   [2.] This truth is confirmed by God's oath, Heb. vi. 14-19, when God
   made a promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he
   sware by himself, saying, Surely in blessing I will bless thee;' which,
   as the apostle reasoneth there, belongeth to us, through Christ. So
   that we have two immutable things--God's promise, and God's oath.
   Surely that is God's oath; if not, let me not be God.

   [3.] This a truth confirmed by Christ's own testimony, by the apostles
   and witnesses chosen to this purpose, whom the world was not able to
   withstand. And by a multitude of miracles wrought by them, and
   extraordinary gifts bestowed on them. Therefore it should be
   entertained as a sure truth, as a sure word of promise.

   Use. It serveth to show us how this proposition is to be entertained by
   us, as a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation and belief.
   Such truths are so commended to us to show how they should be received.
   It is to check our unbelief that these asseverations and commendations
   are annexed to great truths. A physician commendeth some medicines, not
   that they need it, but that the patient may the better take them. So we
   say it is true, not as if there were a doubt of it, but that the act of
   your faith may be the more revived and exercised upon these truths. Now
   then close with this truth both in the general and particularly.

   1. In the general, look upon it as a faithful saying, that Christ the
   Son of God came into the world. There is a great deal of difference in
   men's assent to the gospel in the general. Every one doth not believe
   it to be a word of truth. First, In some there is but a conjectural
   apprehension; it may be true, or it may not, for they never made a
   strict inquiry into it, only received it by tradition. As the men of
   Samaria, Christ telleth them, Ye worship ye know not what,' John iv.
   22. So they take up the gospel at hap-hazard, not knowing the worth of
   it, never feeling the power of it, nor experiencing the comfort of it.
   Secondly, In others there is but opinion, in which the mind is strongly
   swayed to think it true, but they cannot tell how it may prove. There
   are fears and doubts of the falsehood, as well as of the truth of it.
   They cannot contradict it, and yet cannot settle in it, for the
   establishing of their souls. There may be some ungrounded overly
   persuasions, which may work in them that which the apostle calleth an
   enlightening, and a tasting of the powers of the world to come, Heb.
   vi. 5. As some were drawn into baptism in the primitive church out of a
   probable conceit of the truth of the gospel, there may be some flashy
   momentary lightnings, but in few there are real and thorough
   persuasions of the truth of this proposition.

   2. In particular, we should get the riches of assurance of
   understanding, that we may fetch comfort out of it for ourselves. We
   should all say, For our sins Christ died; and if that word be too
   common, my sins. Take heed of making God a liar: 1 John v. 10, He that
   believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the
   record that God gave of his Son.' Here is the oath of the Spirit of
   God, Surely he hath borne our griefs.' There should be the like
   confidence in our hearts as there is truth in the proposition. Do not
   doubt of the sure word of promise. Many are loth to determine upon
   comfort; they are afraid of presumption; they are afraid to look upon
   the promises on the bright side: why then, look upon them in the
   humbling way. Claim by the apostle's tenure, He came to save sinners,
   of whom I am chief,' 1 Tim. i. 15. He came to die for sinners; why not
   then for me? I am sure I am as much a sinner as any other man, and more
   too. The faithful saying is, that Christ came to die for sinners;
   surely I am sinner enough for Christ to save,--that you can say by
   experience. Why, if the word be true, it is as true Christ came to take
   away our sins.

   But how shall I look upon this as a faithful saying, that Christ came
   to die for my sins? Is not that to believe a lie, suppose I be a
   reprobate?

   Ans. [1.] The word of God excludeth none but those that exclude
   themselves. We are to go to God's revealed will; that we are bound to
   believe, though in his secret will it should not be truth. As Abraham
   was bound to believe, after God's command, that Isaac should die under
   his hand, though God had otherwise purposed; for you know it is said, 1
   Tim. ii. 4, Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the
   knowledge of the truth.' God showeth them that the promulgation of the
   gospel is general.

   [2.] Though every wicked man is not bound to believe that his sins are
   pardoned, yet he is bound to come to Christ that he may obtain
   forgiveness. Therefore I close this proposition with a great deal of
   joy, that surely Christ came to pardon our sins, and to carry our
   griefs. So much to this use and point.

   2. From the first act of Christ's love, with the object of it: He hath
   borne our griefs;' that is, took our sins upon him: the point is:--

   Doct. 2. That Jesus Christ bore the guilt of our sins.

   All our griefs were really transacted and cast upon him. The scriptures
   delight much in the expression of Christ's bearing our sins, and it
   implieth two things:--

   1. A sublation, a taking of them away from us.

   2. A susception of them upon himself. Look, as the sacrifice is said to
   bear the iniquities of the people, and the two goats the slain goat and
   the scape-goat--typed out Christ's death and resurrection: Lev. xvi.
   22, And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land
   not inhabited;' so Christ is said to bear our sins in his own body upon
   the tree,' 1 Peter ii. 24--the guilt and the punishment of them. So
   Heb. ix. 28, it is said, Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
   many;' and John i. 29, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
   sins of the world,'--a'irei: the word signifieth both to bear and to
   take away. Now, this bearing, in the language of the scripture,
   implieth a real susception of guilt; not only Christ's taking away of
   sin from us, but a taking of it into his own person; as Ezek. xviii.
   20, The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall
   the father bear the iniquity of the son;' that is, his wickedness and
   his guilt shall not be transacted upon him. Now Christ bore our sins:--

   [1.] That he might make a change with us: 2 Cor. v. 21, He was made sin
   for us that knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God
   in him.' He would take our sins, that we might have his righteousness.
   What a great exchange is here! As if a king should take a beggar's
   weeds and dunghill rags for his own royal robes. It was much for Joshua
   to have his filthy garments taken from him, more to have change of
   raiment; most of all that Christ should take such cast-off rags upon
   himself. We are righteousness in him, he is sin in us. In the great
   contrivance of the covenant, everything is done by way of exchange. The
   Son of God was made the Son of man, that the sons of men might become
   the sons of God. He took our misery that we might have his glory. He
   was born of a woman that we might be born of God. Christ was really sin
   for us, that we might be really righteous in him.

   [2.] That he might destroy sin in us, by taking it into his own person:
   1 Peter ii. 24, He bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might
   be dead unto sin,'--apogenomenoi: the word signifieth that we might be
   unborn to sin: it cannot be fully rendered. We were before dead in
   sins: Christ would make us dead to sin, and, therefore, he took it into
   his own person. You know some foul diseases pass from us by the
   transmission of the infection to others. Christ was infected, as it
   were, by our corruptions, that we might be free. We, that were dead in
   sins, are now dead to sin, the vigour and strength of sin being
   extinguished by virtue derived from Christ's bearing of them, whereby
   the soul is restored to health again.

   The uses of this point are:--

   1. To discover to us the love of Christ, whereby our faith hath
   somewhat to fix and dwell upon. The love of Christ is seen in that he
   would not only take away the guilt of sins, but take it into his own
   person. Here is the lowest condescension, and so the highest expression
   of love, that he was made sin.' This is that which is most ab horrent
   from the purity of the divine nature, to be sin; and yet he was so for
   our sakes; that was the lowest step and condescension that could be.
   Christ was made many things for us, but there is the highest wonder of
   his love, that he should be made sin for us. Usually that is the
   highest expression of love, when men do not only stoop beneath
   themselves, but do that which is contrary to their natures, to do us
   good. As when a stern man doth not only serve our necessities in his
   own way, but with great affability; and when a modest man is bold for
   our sakes. These things take with us, when men deny their very tempers
   and dispositions to serve us. This was the greatest self-denial in
   Christ, to become sin. Oh, work it upon your hearts, and display it
   before your faith! Here is cause of triumph: Col. ii. 14, Whatever was
   contrary to us, Christ took it away, nailing it to his cross.' How
   nailed it? It was nailed when Christ was nailed: he bore it in his own
   person. Oh, how hath God provided for the triumph of our faith!

   Doct. 3. I might further observe, that sin is our soul-sickness.

   He took our griefs or sickness. The more gracious, the more healthy the
   soul is: 3 John 2, I wish above all thing that thou mayest prosper and
   be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.' Gaius had a healthy soul in
   a sickly body. As a disease blasteth the perfection and beauty of the
   body, so doth sin that of the soul,--it doth not thrive and prosper
   under it. There are some sins that bear a great analogy and resemblance
   with outward diseases, and affect the soul just as they do the body.
   But I will not speak to that now.

   I proceed to a fourth point from the second act of Christ's love.

   Doct 4. That the Lord Jesus Christ took not only our sickness but our
   sorrows.

   He did not only bear our griefs, but carried our sorrows; that is, took
   not only our guilt, but our punishment upon him; that is, the very
   wrath that we should have endured if we had suffered for sin, even the
   curse of the law and the wrath of God. He put himself in our stead;
   Christ would give us an experience of what he freed us from in his own
   person. That I may make this out to you, consider:--(1.) What; (2.)
   How; (3.) Why Christ suffered.

   1. What Christ suffered. His sufferings were not only outward and
   visible, such as he endured in the garden, in the hall, and on the
   cross,--buffetings, scourgings, taunting insultations, being mocked,
   spit upon, crowned with thorns, pierced, crucified. Not only these, but
   inward sufferings, such as were:--

   [1.] The assaults of spiritual wickednesses. The devil, seeing Christ
   under great agonies, thought he had a great advantage upon him, and
   therefore was very busy with him. Now God gave him leave, and Christ
   offered as it were the occasion, being stirred with passions; though,
   as a glass of clean water that is shaken, there was no filth to arise.
   God gave Satan leave, the chains of his providence being taken off from
   him, as in that place, Luke xxii. 53, This is your hour, and the power
   of darkness:' he hora kai he exousia tou skotous. Hell's licentious
   time,--it was, as it were, let loose to do what it would. The devil,
   who would tempt Christ in his fasting, would now much more in his
   dissolution and desertion: hell had a kind of license to tempt Christ,
   so far as it might stand with the innocency of his person.

   [2.] The desertion of God the Father, whereby all comfort was eclipsed
   and hidden from his soul; he was sequestered from all sense of comfort,
   though the union were not dissolved. Therefore, he crieth out, Mat.
   xxvii. 46, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' Though he lost
   his Father's love, it was not as if he had apprehensions that there was
   any change in God towards him; God was the same to Christ still, though
   not appearing in the same way: as the sun is the same, whether it shine
   through a red or green glass, and so casteth sometimes a comfortable
   and sometimes a bloody reflection.

   [3.] He suffered inwardly the impressions of his Father's wrath, and
   that was a heavy burden indeed; and, therefore, he saith, Mat. xxvi.
   38, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.' It is said, Gal.
   iii. 13, He was made a curse for us;' not only deprived of love, but
   made a curse. He suffered so much of the wrath of God, and underwent
   the curse of the law, so far forth as it might stand with his office
   and person, that, if he had not been God, he would have remained under
   that curse to all eternity.

   2. How he suffered. It was with a great deal of reluctancy and
   consternation expressed in his prayers, fears, grief, insomuch that he
   needed an angel to comfort him; and yet, notwithstanding, he was in so
   great an agony, that he sweat great drops of blood: the word is
   thromboi, crumbs and clots of blood, Luke xxii. 44. That implieth a
   great deal of consternation of mind. Ordinarily, men, when they are in
   a great passion, emit sweat; but the impression of it was so strong
   upon Christ that he emitted blood,--nay, thick clots of blood, a sign
   that his soul laboured under the violence of strong passions. How
   poorly, then, do they provide for the honour of our Saviour that say he
   suffered no more than the cruelty and malice of men! The martyrs have
   suffered a great deal of more outward cruelty from men cheerfully, when
   they have been sawed, burned, melted, roasted, harrowed, boiled in lead
   or oil. They never felt much agonies and consternations, and,
   therefore, there was more in Christ's suffering than man's cruelty.

   3. Let us consider why he suffered, and how that will clear the
   conclusion we have in hand.

   [1.] He suffered to free us from the wrath which he endured, that was
   one end: 1 Thes. i. 10, Even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to
   come.' Therefore, he underwent it in his own person; and the pains of
   hell did in a manner compass him round [about. The ground of this
   reason lieth in this, that Christ was our surety and substitute, and,
   therefore, was to subject himself to that wrath which we had deserved
   by our sins, and should have endured in our persons, if he had not
   redeemed us from it. Our surety must carry our sorrows. He was to
   suffer not only for us, but in our name and stead; and the surety was
   to pay the same sum of money that the debtor oweth: Heb. vii. 22, Jesus
   was made a surety of a better testament.' The debt of punishment was to
   be exacted of him, as well as the debt of obedience. Jesus was made our
   surety, and he fully satisfied God's justice for that punishment that
   we owed to him by suffering it in his own person.

   [2.] He was to suffer to satisfy for our sins that he had taken upon
   him; for our sins were really put upon Christ, as was shown in the
   former point. And if the sins and the punishment, which was the wrath
   of God, it followeth by a necessary consequence, that he who bore our
   griefs should also carry our sorrows. The ground of this reason is,
   because, as God meant to magnify his mercy at this time, so also his
   justice. He would not pardon sin without satisfaction for sin in us, or
   in our surety: Ps. cxvi. 5, Gracious is the Lord, and righteous.' Now,
   if God had restored mankind without requiring our sins of Christ, he
   had only discovered his mercy. Nay, if an ordinary death had been
   accepted, as some dream of an acceptation, it had been all grace still.
   Now, it was God's design to express his justice as well as his mercy:
   Rom. iii. 25, Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through
   faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of
   sins.' And the apostle repeateth it, ver. 26, To declare, I say, his
   righteousness, that he might be just and the justifier of him that
   believeth in Jesus;' that is, that he might be acknowledged just, even
   while of mercy he forgave sins. This is what the light of nature
   teacheth men, that justice must be satisfied before mercy could have a
   free passage. And, indeed, in the business of believing, the soul
   sticketh here: God is a just God, and this was what made the most
   seeing and knowing heathens to be at a loss how divine justice could be
   satisfied; and, therefore, to expiate guilt, they would give all that
   was near and dear to them,--the fruit of their bodies for the sin of
   their souls. Whereas the gospel, you see, holdeth it forth in a sweet
   way,--Christ suffering the infinite wrath of his Father, even as much
   as would have sunk any soul to hell eternally, if it had been laid upon
   him.

   These arguments, I conceive, are sufficient. I will not traverse all
   the arguments and doubts that might be objected. Solid and fundamental
   truths are much weakened and lessened in the hearts of the hearers,
   when they are proposed in a controversial way; and therefore, lest I
   should prejudice this comfortable doctrine, while I go about to confirm
   it, I shall only touch upon two objections that concern the main state
   of the point.

   Object. 1. If Christ made a full satisfaction by bearing our sorrows
   and his Father's wrath, how then doth God love us freely?--how is mercy
   magnified?

   I answer briefly--The freeness of God's love or mercy doth not exclude
   the fulness of Christ's merit. You shall see the apostle joineth both
   together, God's mercy and Christ's merit: Rom. iii. 24, Being justified
   freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.'
   Freely, in respect of us; we could contribute nothing of desert, nor
   nothing of satisfaction toward it. There can be no price paid by
   ourselves, nor by any for us. We could not satisfy for ourselves, nor
   merit a satisfier. And therefore there is a great deal of freeness of
   mercy held forth in it, in that God freely gave Christ for us. The
   scriptures always speak of Christ as a gift: For God so loved the
   world, that he gave his only-begotten Son.' There are divers respects
   that set out the freeness of the gift. First, In that he gave him of
   his own accord. We could not enlarge our thoughts to such a desire,
   Isa. lxv. 1. As God said in another like case, I am found of them that
   sought me not.' It is impossible that man or angel could take in such a
   contrivance in his thoughts to ask it of God. Secondly, Freely,
   because, as we cannot deserve it, so we cannot requite it. God giveth
   Christ to them that can give nothing for him. But this must be the work
   of another place.

   Object. 2 is this, How did Christ suffer our punishment, since his
   sufferings were but temporary, and ours to be eternal? There are divers
   answers. I will give you that which is most satisfying.

   1. I distinguish of our punishment; it maybe considered two ways: as to
   the substance, and as to the circumstances of it. For the substance,
   Christ suffered it fully, even infinite wrath, though not with such
   circumstances as could not stand with his person and office.

   2. That those circumstances, the eternity and duration of our
   punishment, are not so much in regard of the punishment itself, as the
   persons that undergo it. It is because they cannot conquer and get
   above it. Now Christ was such an excellent person that he could not
   only undergo infinite wrath, but get above it. Christ could set himself
   free by his own power. The scriptures hint this answer in that
   expression, Acts ii. 24, Having loosed the pains of death, because it
   was not possible he should be holden of it.' Death and the curse were,
   as it were, in travail; for look, what pains and throes a travailing
   woman sustaineth till she be delivered of her burden; even such pangs
   did the grave and the curse feel till Christ were gotten free from
   them, for it was impossible he could be holden of it. Thus for that
   objection. Those curses that would have continued upon him for ever and
   ever, Christ conquered by the power of his Godhead, for he was to
   suffer triumphantly.

   Use 1. Is exhortation, to press you to three duties:--

   1. To observe this great work of God, to put the punishment of our sins
   upon Christ.

   [1.] Meditate upon it in your thoughts. Here is enough to take them up
   to all eternity. Deep sufferings seem to challenge from us a serious
   contemplation: Lam. i. 12, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?
   Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is
   done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his
   fierce anger,'--which some have applied to Christ, though I think
   improperly. I quote it only to show you that a transient glance, a mere
   passing by, is not enough for deep sorrows; you must behold and see.
   The scripture speaks of looking upon him whom we have pierced, Zech.
   xii. 10. And observe it seriously; it is not a slight turn of the
   thoughts this way that will serve. What is the reason that men that
   know the evil of sin and the mercy of Christ do not more love Christ
   and hate sin? They have but a slight and superficial apprehension--it
   swimmeth upon the top of their thoughts, and is readily up: It is true
   we are all sinners, and God is merciful. These men, though they speak
   often of it, do least of all believe it. Therefore do not hastily run
   over these truths. The scriptures always, when they express the love of
   God, they seem to give occasion for some pause of the thoughts: God so
   loved the world!' Behold what manner of love!' and the like. The works
   of God's providence require an accurate search: Ps. cxi. 2, The works
   of the Lord are great, and to be sought out by all that take pleasure
   therein.' Much more the great contrivance of the covenant. Take it into
   your thoughts, what it is to have a God suffering, and a God punishing.

   [2.] Observe it with admiration. One said he had gotten this good by
   philosophy, that he had learned to admire at nothing. The more you know
   of the things of God, the more you will admire at every thing,
   especially at this great mystery. There is an observation of curiosity,
   when men look into every creek of it by their reasons, and so lose
   themselves in a mist of errors. The Christian way is to look upon it
   with admiration, to admire the wisdom of God, that he should in such a
   sweet way magnify infinite wisdom and infinite justice at the same
   time. This very thing, the sufferings of Christ, the angels desire to
   pry into, 1 Peter i. 12; if you consult the context, you will find it
   so. He alludeth to the two angels that were set upon the mercy-seat,
   which was the covering of the ark, and typed out Christ. They would
   fain see the utmost of this mystery. They desire to look into it out of
   a thirst of knowledge, or a delight in meditation. So 1 Tim. iii. 16,
   Seen of angels;' that is, this was the ravishing object that took up
   their thoughts.

   2. To learn that which God teacheth us in such an instance. There are
   many profitable lessons. I will but name them:--First, There is the
   evil of sin. God would express his hatred against it by punishing it in
   Christ. Sin is such a thing, that when Christ did but take the guilt of
   it into his own person, he must suffer the infinite wrath of his
   Father. Secondly, Then the impartial severity of divine justice: God
   spared not his own Son. It is said, 2 Peter ii. 4, that he spared not
   the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell.' But lo, here is a
   greater instance: Rom. viii. 32, He spared not his own Son,' when he
   bore our sins by imputation. No prerogative then can hinder. In vain do
   men pretend privileges against God's wrath. There is nothing but Christ
   that hath borne wrath that we can oppose against wrath. There is
   nothing that stoppeth the long fur rows but the casting God's Son in
   the way. Think of this, that you may fear before him. God is a
   consuming fire, Heb. xii. 29. He was so in Christ in a sense, and is so
   to all out of Christ. Thirdly, The law's dignity and indispensableness.
   God would fulfil every tittle; not the least iota must pass away, but
   it must be fulfilled in Christ, both in regard of the duty it
   commandeth, and the curse it annexeth to the breach of it. Fourthly,
   The love of God in providing amply against all our scruples, that he
   would offer us mercy in such a way as he might declare his justice, and
   so satisfy all our doubts. There is a saying usual in some men's
   prayers, We appeal from thy justice to thy mercy.' This expression is
   not so warrantable. God's justice and God's mercy both look comfortably
   upon a sinner through Christ. It is mercy, and mercy purchased, when
   justice is satisfied. God is now faithful and just. That which before
   caused our greatest horror, causeth now our greatest triumph. God is a
   just God. What would men have given heretofore to appease justice? It
   could never enter into men's thoughts which way that should be done,
   till the gospel revealed it.

   3. To render praise and thanksgiving to God. We enjoy a great deal of
   benefit by it, and great benefits require a great deal of duty. Here is
   a double motive to praise. The wrath of God is taken away from us, and
   Christ endured it for us. As to its being taken away from us, consider
   what it is to be freed from the wrath of God. What should we have
   endured if Christ had not made such a satisfaction! You cannot expect
   that I should give you a map of hell. I have observed that great truths
   never do well when they are painted by fancy. War and hell are rather
   pleasant in the description than horrible. It is like there may be a
   little shrinking in the soul; as a gentle fresh gale that is let out
   upon the face of the sea may a little furl the surface and upper part
   rather than stir the billows, it doth not work soundly. A mere relation
   is better than a passionate description. Oh, consider, then, what it is
   to be deprived of all sense of the favour of God, to be delivered over
   to torments ceaseless, endless, and remediless. One flash of God's
   wrath into our consciences, how doth it make us roar! And if a drop be
   so irksome, what is it to have an ocean of wrath poured upon us, and to
   be overwhelmed in soul and body! Oh, what a mercy is it that our
   Saviour hath delivered us from this everlasting vengeance of hell-fire!
   I had rather you should enlarge your hearts to think of these things
   than expatiate upon them. To have all this taken away should make us
   abound in praise. And then, in the next place, consider how Christ took
   it upon himself. He hath carried our sorrows!' There are some rare
   instances and representations of those in story that have exposed
   themselves to violence and cruelty for others; as in Damon and Pythias,
   Pambo, &c. But none riseth so high as this, to wit, the leaving of
   infinite glory to suffer infinite wrath for us--that was a hard
   exchange. Oh, then, work it upon your thoughts, that you may live to
   that God that gave himself for you. The main argument that faith urgeth
   upon the soul is drawn from Christ's suffering for us: Gal. ii. 20, The
   life which I live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,
   who loved me, and gave himself for me.' I should have been given, but
   he gave himself in my stead.

   Use 2. Is information to the children of God to show the happiness of
   those that have an interest in Christ's death. There is no wrath
   against them: Isa. xxvii. 4, Fury is not in me.' There may be sometimes
   filii sub ira; they may have some apprehensions of God's wrath through
   their own sins, when they have offended God. They must get a new act of
   pardon assured to them and to their consciences. There may be
   displeasure, though not wrath. There may be afflictions, and that in
   pursuance of divine vengeance; though for the matter they may be the
   same as light upon wicked men, yet their habitude and use is changed
   unto God's children. They are of exceeding great use to them, to
   quicken them to duties, to humble them for sin, to keep lusts low, to
   prevent vanity and pride of heart, and to brine: us nearer to God. So
   much for this verse.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE FIFTH VERSE.

   He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
   iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and by his
   stripes we are healed.

   THE prophet having in the former verse briefly touched upon the
   sufferings of Christ, and the cause of them, by way of confutation of
   the Jews, he now amplifieth the argument, and enlargeth himself by
   setting it out in other expressions. All words and all thoughts are
   little enough for so great a mystery. It should not be tedious, though
   a man do always dwell upon it. St Paul's e'krina justifieth a minister,
   if he should preach no other thing to you: 1 Cor. ii. 2, For I
   determined not to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ and him
   crucified.' Christ's sufferings are like the widow of Sarepta's cruse;
   though we spend much of the oil of it, it will not fail, it will afford
   more consolation still; and therefore it should not be grievous to you,
   if we hold your meditation to it. The prophet here, now he is fallen
   upon the subject, will not give it over. Though he had told you that
   surely he bore our sorrows and carried our griefs, yet he will not quit
   it so till he hath more fully expressed it to you, as he doth in the
   text: He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
   iniquities,' &c. You may here in this verse observe three things:--

   1. The history of Christ's sufferings.

   2. The cause of them.

   3. The fruit and benefit of them. These three things are scattered in
   divers expressions throughout the verse.

   1. The history of Christ's sufferings, set out by wounds, bruises,
   chastisements, stripes; which expressions are multiplied to fasten the
   thought of it the more upon our minds. And the words do not only imply
   those wounds in Christ's body by the nails, the spear, the scourge, but
   the whole bitterness of his bloody death; and some of the expressions
   will bear it. He was wounded.' It is the manner of the scripture to use
   wounding for killing. He was bruised,' or broken, as it were crushed to
   pieces by the hand of God. The chastisement of our peace.'
   Chastisement, the word is applied to learning; and because lazy and
   slow learners must be whipped, it is applied to signify punishment.
   Some think the prophet alludeth to those that were whipped by the
   sentence of the law, and by way of punishment. And then stripes,'
   mo'lopi autou,--the word signifieth sometimes gore, blood, or scars.
   And I conceive these things are the rather mentioned, wounds, stripes,
   scars, because Christ after his resurrection, for a testimony of the
   reality of his sufferings, retained these wounds and scars. So much for
   the first thing, the history.

   2. The cause of it: for our transgressions, for our iniquities. The
   first word noteth more properly the doing of evil, the latter swerving
   from good; sins of omission and commission: Christ suffered for them
   all: the least neglect of duty, and the least obliquity in duties
   needed Christ to satisfy for them. It was for our iniquities as well as
   our transgressions, our defections from the right way.

   3. The fruits and benefits: they are two--peace and healing.

   [1.] Peace: the chastisement of our peace was upon him. Some understand
   by peace whatsoever is good and precious; it being usual with the
   Hebrews to express it by the word peace. And because the Septuagint
   sometimes turn shelomim, the plural word for peace, into retributions,
   some read it thus, The chastisement of retributions was upon him;' that
   is, God payed him what should have been payed us, namely, punishment
   and wrath. But I conceive it noteth here that peace and reconciliation
   that is between God and a sinner. Christ was chastised to procure it
   for us. Sin made us odious, and enemies to God. Here is the first
   privilege: Christ bore the chastisement of our peace.

   [2.] Healing. A strange paradox, you will think, that we should be
   healed by another's stripes; but so it is. The meaning is, by this our
   souls are cured from the wounds and infection of sin. From the wounds,
   Christ took them upon himself. From the infection, sin is wounded by
   it, as you will see hereafter.

   I come to the points, which are three, according to the parts of the
   text.

   1. That the Lord Jesus at his death endured many cruel and bitter
   sufferings.

   2. That all these sufferings were undergone for our sins and
   transgressions.

   3. That by these sufferings Christ hath purchased for us peace and
   healing.

   Doct. 1. That Jesus Christ at his death endured many cruel and bitter
   sufferings. The prophet sets them out here by wounds, bruises, stripes;
   which words, because they imply most of all his outward and bodily
   sufferings, and what he suffered from the cruelty and malice of man, I
   shall most of all touch upon these things, that they may be matter of
   meditation to you.

   1. He was betrayed by his own disciple; that is sad. It was a double
   stab to Caesar's heart when Brutus was among the conspirators; the
   grief is the more by far. David, in the person of Christ, complaineth
   of it, Ps. lv. 12, 13, It was not an enemy that reproached me; then I
   could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify
   himself against me; then I would have hid my face from him. But it was
   thou, a man, mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.'

   2. Forsaken by the rest of the disciples: Mark xiv. 50, And they all
   forsook him and fled;' that is, all the disciples. And that is a
   misery, to be deprived of the solace of friends when we most want them.
   A friend is for adversity; that is the reason of our choice, that we
   may have some to stand by us in evil times. But all are gone.

   3. He was an object of the common hatred. They do not only come out
   against him with swords and staves, the usual instruments of vulgar
   fury, but thirst after his blood, cry against him, His blood be upon us
   and on our children.' They would rather have Barabbas released than
   Christ.

   4. Then he was haled to the judgment-seat, and there accused and
   sentenced contrary to all law, and their own conscience. When Pilate
   asked of them what evil they found in him, they could rejoin nothing
   but a tumultous noise, Crucify him, crucify him;' that is all the
   reason they urge.

   5. There are several expressions of contempt used to him, which are
   like vinegar to wounds, the very smart and quintessence of grief. They
   buffeted him, that is an ignominious expression of cruelty; buffeting
   being the punishment of slaves. Spitting, which was another token of
   contempt among the Jews: If her father had spit upon her, should she
   not be unclean seven days?' Numb. xii. 14. Yea, Job reckoned it as a
   great aggravation of his sufferings: Job xxx. 10, They abhor me, they
   even dare to spit upon me.' And then they whipped and mocked him with a
   robe, a sceptre of reeds, and a crown of thorns. There can be no
   greater dishonour done to a man than to twit him with his dignity, to
   put the mock habiliments of majesty upon him. And then as to their
   several beatings and smitings, I cannot mention all. And at last they
   crucified him, a death designed for men accursed. Usually those that
   suffered that death were looked upon as accursed by God and men; Deut.
   xxi. 23, Cursed is every one that hangeth upon a tree.' It was the
   death of grievous malefactors, such as blasphemers and idolaters. Nay,
   he was hanged between two thieves, in medio latronum, tanquam latronum
   maximus; he was put in the midst, as if he was the greatest malefactor
   of the three. And when he was dead, he was wounded with a spear, John
   xix. 34. An impotent, silly malice, to triumph over the dead! Thus I
   have given you a taste of what you may read more fully in the
   evangelists.

   I come now to apply it.

   Use 1. It serveth for consolation, for examples are apt to ease the
   soul. The great sting of misery is, that we think it strange, and such
   a thing as never happened: Is there any sorrow like my sorrow?' Lam. i.
   12. We are all apt to say so. Why, here is a great example. Christ,
   that he might sanctify afflictions to us, endured them in his own
   person. Comfort is never so well taken as when we speak to the
   particular case. Why, here in Christ's instance there is comfort.
   Whatever the case and distress be, there is some use in the argument: 1
   Peter ii. 21, Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example that we
   should follow his steps.' There is a great deal of merit in Christ's
   sufferings. Example is not all, and yet example is much. God would
   suffer too, that he might provide against all the terrible troubles you
   can be cast upon. I shall instance a little in those things that cause
   the greatest storm and tumult in the heart.

   1. In case thy greatest woe is brought about to thee by the men of
   thine own family and cherishing, remember Christ was so used, and so
   was St Paul. Among the other dangers that he reckoned up, he saith, In
   perils among false brethren.' And divers of the martyrs in church
   history have been betrayed into the hands of their enemies by their
   friends and allies. It is much, I confess, to meet with evil usage from
   whom we least looked for it. And yet you see this hath been the lot of
   Christ and the people of God before you.

   2. Is the case so, that you are in misery and forsaken of friends? It
   is a very miserable case, that you find respect no longer than you are
   able to purchase it. Why, Christ was left by his own disciples; and it
   is the lot of many a faithful servant of God, and will be till you can
   weed self-love out of men's hearts. Usually they aim at their own good
   in dispensing of their respects; and when they cannot serve them selves
   of us, they will leave us: Prov. xiv. 20, The poor is hated by his
   neighbour, but the rich hath many friends.'

   3. Is it so that thou art an object of the common hatred, like Ishmael,
   thy hand against every man, and every man's hand against thine? Christ
   suffered it, and it is the lot of many a public-spirited servant of
   God. Lapidibus nos invadit inimicum vulgus, saith Tertullian. The
   common people are ready to brain us with stones wheresoever we go.
   Remember the Ephesian tumult, where the common people raged against
   Paul, so that he speaketh of them as if they had put off all humanity:
   1 Cor. xv. 32, If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at
   Ephesus, what advantageth it me?' Hinting at that story in Acts xix.
   And it is the lot of many of God's people now to be cruelly handled by
   rude hands; and evil neighbours look upon the day of their brethren's
   adversity, and are as some of them that do it.

   4. To be denied the benefit of law, the wall of our safety, the fence
   of our privileges and interests. The thing we suffer many times doth
   not grieve us so much as the injustice of it. Why, remember it was
   Christ's case; he was condemned, though none could fasten the least
   guilt upon him. So it is many a Christian's case to be denied all right
   and equity: Eccles. v. 8, If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and
   violent perverting of justice and judgment in a province, marvel not at
   the matter; for he that is higher than the highest regardeth, and there
   be higher than they.' The primitive martyrs were condemned before they
   were heard. Tertullian complaineth much that they would not hear the
   Christians plead for themselves. So it would make a man gnash his teeth
   for indignation to see what undue proceedings there were against the
   martyrs that were convened before the bishops here in England; the case
   was determined before heard. It was likewise so of late, agreeable to
   what Tertullian spake of the heathen.

   5. Art thou handled with a great deal of contempt, as in all the in
   stances of Christ's sufferings, buffeted with the back of the hand? So
   was Christ: Mat. v. 39, Whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek,
   turn to him the other also.' A transverse blow, such as might light
   upon the right cheek, expresseth great contempt. Christ would have you
   bear it. Again, be it spitting upon us, any expression of contempt,
   this is that which the nature of man stormeth at; every one counteth
   himself worthy of some respect. And yet Christ submitted to it. So Job,
   they even dare to spit upon me.' See how the prophet speaketh in the
   person of Christ, Isa. l. 6, I gave my back to the smiters, and my
   cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame
   and spitting.' Suppose thy case to be an opprobrious punishment. John
   Frith was put in the stocks, mocked, and made a laughing-stock, marked
   as a common vagrant. So was Christ, so was Samson, and so it was with
   Israel: Jer. xlviii. 27, For was not Israel a derision unto thee? Was
   he found among thieves?' They did hoot at them, as boys do in the
   street after a thief when he is taken. Again, is there some upbraiding
   pageantry used in contempt of thee? Why, they gave Christ a reeden
   sceptre and a thorny crown. John Huss and Jerome of Prague had painted
   coats put upon them with devils round about them; and many poor souls
   have been served in that manner. I remember a story of a king of
   England in his distress, whom they would trim upon a hill with cold
   water. Ay but, saith he, Hot water will come, meaning his tears. Is thy
   case so, that thou art called to suffer a shameful death for Christ?
   Christ suffered the shamefulest death that can be for thee. Hanging is
   no dishonour to a Christian. It is not the death, but the cause that
   maketh it shameful. Ludovicus Marsaius thought himself honoured by his
   rope. Cur non et mihi quoque torquem donas, et hujus ordinis equitem
   creas?--Give me a rope likewise, saith he, and make me a knight of this
   noble order. St Paul saith, With this chain,' holding it up by way of
   triumph. A man would have thought that it had been a golden chain that
   he spake of, since he honoured it so much, when, alas! it was iron.
   Christ hath taken away all shame of punishment. And then they gave
   Christ vinegar instead of drink. This has been the lot of many
   Christians upon the inquisition-rack. So to have your dying words
   misconstrued and misreported; there have not been wanting in all ages
   those that have turned the saints' Eloi into Elias. What reports have
   there been of Tremellius turning Jew, and of divers protestants turning
   papists! So after death; for you may live in such calamitous times in
   which you may see a great deal of cruelty exercised, not only upon the
   bodies of the saints here, but even after death; so it was with Christ,
   and so with his people. They were not safe when they had taken
   sanctuary in the grave. So the papists did against the bones of
   Wickliffe, Bucer, and others. Nay, if it were possible, they would
   reach to the damnation of the soul. As the papists said of John Huss,
   mandamus animam diabolo. And then, as Christ was crucified in the midst
   of two thieves, so it may be your case to be numbered among
   transgressors, to be counted heretics, factious, schismatics; this is
   what the people of God hath suffered from the proud men of the world.
   Papists would make Protestantism a bundle of old errors, as Baily says
   in the Jesuit's Catechism. Thus the enemies, like the cruel watchmen,
   would fain take away the garment from the spouse, expose her to shame
   and contempt in the world. But remember, in all these cases Jesus
   Christ has gone before you.

   Use 2. Did Jesus endure such cruel and bitter sufferings? It informeth
   you how unlike Christ they are who live in a way of pleasure and ease,
   as if the way to heaven were over a bed of roses. If Christ were a Man
   of Sorrows, certainly they are men of pleasures, such as mind nothing
   but present contentments and satisfactions. Thus I have given you the
   history of Christ's sufferings.

   I now come to the cause. We must not only look upon the sufferings of
   Christ, but must look upon the cause of it. The point is:--

   Doct. That Jesus Christ endured all these bitter sufferings at his
   death for our sins. Take a place or two of scripture to prove this:
   Rom. iv. 25, Who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for
   our justification.' You have need of places to confirm you when the
   most substantial truths are questioned. Delivered, that is delivered to
   death for our transgressions: 1 Cor. xv. 3, For I delivered unto you
   first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our
   sins according to the scriptures.' This was the doctrine St Paul would
   preach among them, and the doctrine that contained the drift of the
   scriptures. He suffered for our sins, that he might become a sacrifice
   to appease God for us. That was it that all the world thirsted after,
   an expiation; and it is fully performed by Christ. God for a while
   trained up his people in sacrifices, that he might type out the Lamb of
   God that was to be slain for the satisfying of wronged justice. But I
   shall say no more to that here, but proceed to application.

   Use 1. It confuteth divers errors and mistakes in doctrine, viz.:--

   1. That evil blasphemy of the Socinians, that say that Christ only died
   by occasion of sin, not for sin. The scriptures speak plainly, and yet
   vain men list to blaspheme, that they may take away the merit of
   Christ's passion, and establish only his example. Christ did not only
   leave us an example, but satisfied for our sins. Adam left us more than
   an example of sin, and Christ left us more than an example of
   suffering.

   2. The derogatory doctrine of the papists, who extend this full
   satisfaction of Christ to sins only committed before baptism; but as
   for mortal sins, and sins committed after baptism, they say we receive
   forgiveness only of the eternal, but not of the temporal punishment of
   them, which remaineth to be suffered by us to the satisfaction of
   divine justice. But when the scriptures speak so fully of all sins,
   transgressions, and iniquities satisfied for, why should men fancy a
   restraint? In human matters we account those things that are in our
   favour may be construed in the largest sense that they can bear with
   probability. Christians, stand for your liberty against those
   encroachments of Antichrist.

   3. That fond dream of some that think Christ's sufferings were any way
   for himself. They urge for it Luke xxiv. 26, Ought not Christ to have
   suffered these things, and then to enter into his glory?' That proveth
   it an antecedent, not a cause or merit of glory. There is a difference
   between consequents and effects: Phil. ii. 8, 9, He became obedient
   unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God hath highly
   exalted him:' dio` signifieth after which. In Dan. ix. 26, it is said,
   The Messiah shall be cut off, but not for himself.' And so here, He was
   wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities.'

   Use 2. Is exhortation to look upon the cause of Christ's sufferings. Mr
   Perkins well observeth it to be a superstitious looking upon Christ,
   when we reflect upon his passion without looking upon the cause. So to
   look upon him in a crucifix is superstition to the eye; and to look
   upon his sufferings as a dolorous and sad story, is superstition to the
   ear. Look, then, upon them as they refer to the cause, to wit, our
   sins. This is the consideration that maketh them profitable and useful
   to us. The cause yieldeth this profit.

   1. Here is matter for our faith to work upon. Christ died for those
   things that trouble a gracious heart, viz., sins. One saith, Send
   drooping Christians to the 53d of Isaiah, send them to this place, He
   was wounded' for that for which your consciences were wounded. When the
   soul groaneth under the sad apprehensions of God's wrath and hell's
   horror, why here is thy comfort, He was wounded for our
   transgressions,' Pray as those for the distressed: Job xxxiii. 24,
   Deliver me from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom.' O Lord,
   here I have found a ransom; show him Christ's wounds: O Lord, wilt not
   thou forgive in a servant what thou didst punish in a Son? What is
   there in sin that there is not in Christ's sufferings? Are they
   manifold? Tell God here are wounds, bruises, stripes, chastisements.
   Are they great? Here is infinite wrath suffered, divine justice fully
   satisfied. Art thou a base, vile, filthy person? Christ is a glorious
   and all-sufficient Saviour. Every way here is triumph for faith.

   2. Here is an object for your love. It is a great testimony of the love
   of Christ, that he was wounded for our transgressions. Viscera patent
   per vulnera--you may see his bowels through his wounds. A strange kind
   of surgery! The whole body is sick, and the head wounded to cure it. We
   committed the sins, and Christ suffered the punishment due to them.
   Usually, we love them more that suffer for us, than those that
   otherwise do us good. Oh, work it upon your affections!

   3. It giveth you help in your endeavours against sin.

   [1.] It is a help to humble us for sins past. There is a leanness in
   the soul many times, and we cannot make sin so odious and grievous to
   our souls as we would. Take in this circumstance; all Christ's
   sufferings and wounds were but the effects of our sins. This is a glass
   which will discover it to us, our knowledge is by the effects. The
   effects of sin were never so apparent and eminent as in Christ. Oh,
   look upon him whom you have pierced, and then mourn, Zech. x. 12.

   [2.] To caution you against sins to come. Here is a double argument,
   from experience, and from love.

   (1.) From experience. Sin is not so sweet as the sinner imagines.
   Christ suffered bitter things when he bore it in his body upon the
   tree. It lieth when it flattereth you with hopes of some contentment.
   Sin indeed smileth upon the soul at the first coming. Therefore Solomon
   saith, Prov. xxiii. 31, Look not upon the wine when it is red, when it
   giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright;' that is,
   upon the seeming pleasure of it. Oh, remember, it cost Christ dear; it
   is a flattering, deceiving thing.

   (2.) From love. Oh, shall I wound Christ again? Shall I grieve God once
   more? We hate that which hath injured our friends. Shall I allow that
   in my bosom which Christ hates? Use yourselves to these meditations
   upon the least solicitations to drunkenness, adultery, and the like: 1
   Peter iv. 1, Forasmuch as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
   yourselves likewise with the same mind.' The apostle meaneth, we should
   arm ourselves with such contemplations as Christ's death affordeth us.
   He speaketh of it as a great remedy against temptations. By such
   thoughts the work of the Spirit is perfected. By drunkenness, thou
   givest him vinegar to drink; thy oppression is a wounding of his sides;
   wresting scripture is a turning of Eloi into Elias; scoffing at
   religion is spitting upon him; jeering of his ministers is like the
   soldiers jeering at him; professing him for fashion's sake, and hating
   him in your hearts, is a putting mock habiliments upon him; by abusing
   of his servants thou dost again buffet and beat him. Thus you may
   exemplify in every sin.

   I am now to make entrance upon the last point--

   That by these sufferings, Christ hath purchased for us peace and
   healing.

   I begin with the first of these benefits.

   1. That Christ hath purchased peace for his people, The chastisement of
   our peace was upon him.' Peace, among other expositions of the phrase,
   I take to be that reconciliation and amity that was wrought out between
   God and a sinner. Christ was chastised to procure it for us, and all
   other good things that follow upon it.

   I shall prove it to you by scripture, that one of the great benefits
   that we enjoy by Christ's sufferings is peace, or the favour of God.
   Take a few scriptures: Rom. v. 1, Being justified by faith, we have
   peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.' There is peace of
   conscience, and peace with God, which is nothing else but our atonement
   and reconciliation with him. Every one that is justified hath not peace
   of conscience; but every one that is justified hath peace with God.
   There is a quarrel between God and the soul because of sin; your sins
   have separated between God and you. Sin maketh God not only an utter
   enemy, but a severe punisher. Now this strife and quarrel is taken up
   by Christ: through Jesus it is said we have peace. He maketh God our
   friend; so Col. i. 20, And having made peace through the blood of his
   cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself.' By the blood of
   his cross; that is, by the bloody cruel death he suffered upon the
   cross, he took away sin and wrath. The scriptures speak of what is most
   visible: so Eph. ii. 14, He is our peace, who hath made both one, and
   hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us.' He is our
   peace, the abstract for the concrete; such a speech as is usual in
   relation to the business of Christ's undertaking; even as he is wisdom
   to us, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, so Zech. ix. 10,
   He shall speak peace to the heathen;' so Isa. ix. 8, Christ is called
   the Prince of peace.' Look, as we call men by the better title, as we
   say the king of England, not mentioning the lesser dominions, as Scot
   land, Wales, Ireland; and the king of France, not taking in the petty
   governments in our ordinary way of speaking; so Christ is set forth by
   the great privilege he hath purchased for mankind, which includes other
   things: Mic. v. 5, And this man shall be the peace.' This man shall be
   our peace, the Prince of peace. All these expressions imply, that as we
   are said to have it this way, so we can have it no other way.

   I come to the reasons of the point.

   1. Because Christ by his death hath slain all hatred. It is the
   apostle's phrase: Eph. ii. 16, And that he might reconcile both unto
   God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby;' that
   is, took away the cause of hatred; and the cause being taken away, the
   effect ceaseth. Look, as when there is a whisperer that goeth between
   party and party, and sets them at odds and variance, we say we shall
   never be friends till such an one be removed out of the way; so it was
   between God and the soul, there is no hope of agreement till those that
   do the ill offices between God and us be removed. And therefore Christ
   himself would die rather than not slay our enemy. He hath slain hatred
   by taking away the cause of it, which was:--

   [1.] The just wrath of God. Now that was abolished by Christ; he
   conquered it by suffering it; insomuch that God saith, Fury is not in
   me.' Isa. xxvii. 4. God's justice being satisfied in Christ, he doth
   not pursue revenge against his people. Is there any fury in God?

   [2.] Sin in us, that was the cause of hatred. You may consider it both
   in its guilt and power, and both sit heavy upon the soul.

   (1.) The guilt of it. There can be no peace as long as this lieth
   charged upon the soul. This works all that distance and hatred between
   us and God; and therefore guilt will cause horror: Job xiii. 26, Thou
   writest bitter things against me, and makest me possess the iniquities
   of my youth;' that is, bitter enough to possess sins, to own the guilt
   of them. It was as great a threatening as Christ could use, when he
   told the Jews they should die in their sins, John viii. 21-24. Oh, it
   is a miserable thing that death should seize upon us in our sins! What
   a perplexity is the soul then left to! Whither will it go when it dieth
   in its own guilt? Now this is taken away by Christ; and therefore it is
   so often said that we have remission of sins by his blood: 1 John i. 7,
   And the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin.'

   (2.) The power of sin. This disturbeth and filleth the soul with the
   sense of God's wrath, and embittereth the soul against God. Through the
   strength of sin we hate God, because we cannot but look upon him as a
   punisher of it. Now Christ slayeth this hatred by sending his Spirit to
   kill our enmity, to heal our poisoned natures, and maketh us more
   willing and careful to please God. It is said, Titus iii. 6, The Spirit
   of regeneration is shed on us abundantly (or richly), through Jesus
   Christ our Saviour.' He taketh away that rancorous disposition that is
   in the heart. This is the first reason: Christ taketh away hatred, and
   therefore purchaseth peace.

   2. Because he hath taken away all show of hatred. The ceremonial law
   was an ordinance hinting out our guilt. Now Christ would take away
   whatever in show made against us, or was contrary to us: Col. ii. 14,
   He took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.' He would not leave
   any ground for doubt or suspicion; he hath provided against all our
   scruples: Christ would not leave the least line uncrossed, our own
   confessions do not make against us. As soon as you give in the bill,
   Christ teareth it; he hath nailed all in triumph to his cross. You can
   urge many things against yourselves; ay! but all these things are
   pardoned, and God hath nothing to show for the debt. St Paul says, 1
   Tim. i. 13, I was a blasphemer and a persecutor;' a heavy bill, but I
   obtained mercy.' All this was taken out of the way. Christ hath not
   only paid the debt, but torn also the bonds. By his death on the cross
   he did as it were declare to the believer that God hath nothing to show
   against him. As there is not anger, so there should not be suspicion of
   anger. He hath taken up the controversy that was between God and the
   soul.

   3. Christ hath procured us favour. Not only the matter that kindleth
   anger, and all show of it is taken away, but love is procured: the
   children of wrath are become the children of love: Mat. iii. 17, This
   is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' The eyes of God's
   holiness cannot but be offended with a filthy, polluted sinner, yet he
   is well-pleased with them in Christ, and so they are not only objects
   of his love but of his delight: Isa. lxii. 4, But thou shalt be called
   Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah; for the Lord delighteth in thee;' and
   in another place, He shall rejoice over them to do them good.' A man
   delighteth in things that are most suitable and agree able to his
   nature. There cannot be a more pleasing work to God than to do his
   people good. It is said, Luke xv. 5, of the lost sheep, that when he
   hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.' Before there
   could be no work more suitable to God's justice than to punish sinners;
   whereas now it is, as the prophet calleth it, his strange work,' Isa.
   xxviii. 21, a thing that he would not be acquainted with towards his
   people. Whereas, to the wicked, still he laughs at their destruction,
   Prov. i. 26. Therefore, Christ hath purchased peace for us, because he
   hath not only taken away anger but procured favour. Among men, anger
   many times may be taken away, but they have not love. Rebels, after a
   pardon, live in a great deal of umbrage, and are under suspicion; the
   scars remain though the wound be cured: as Absalom, when pardoned, did
   not see the king's face. Artificial cracks will be seen though
   soldered; but it is not so here, for we are re-instated in God's love
   and affections. Christ hath satisfied wrath and merited favour; so that
   the soul can look upon God with a great deal of comfort and joy.

   Use 1. This serveth to reprove those--

   1. That fetch their peace anywhere else. No comfort is lasting but what
   floweth from the blood of Christ; that only is the true peace that he
   hath merited.

   2. Those that are against peace, or the settling of the heart in the
   sufferings of Jesus Christ. I begin with these first, and they are of
   two sorts:--

   [1.] Such as are grossly ignorant of Christian privileges, and think it
   a duty to doubt, and a matter of merit to keep themselves upon terms of
   perplexity. A popish spirit haunts many; they think assurance a dry
   doctrine, and therefore do not strive to settle their hearts; as if
   there could be no duty where there is no fear. Hereby they plainly
   discover out of what principles they act for God,--to wit, out of a
   servile spirit; and therefore they cannot be kept right any longer than
   they fear wrath. O brethren! turn these evil thoughts out of your
   hearts. True peace is a great benefit that Christ hath purchased for
   us.

   [2.] Such as would fain apply themselves to Christ, but are loth to
   busy themselves with what should make for the settling of their hearts
   and establishing their spirits; as if it were more pleasing to God to
   keep the conscience raw with sins, than to heal it with Christ's
   righteousness. A man should labour after peace with God, and peace of
   conscience too. It is a natural superstitious thought to think God is
   pleased with the mere sorrow of a creature; and, therefore, false
   worshippers have wounded themselves, that they might make some dolorous
   impressions upon his mind. Christ suffered the sorrows that you might
   have the peace; the chastisement of your peace was upon him. Why should
   you stand out against comfort, if there were not some secret thought of
   satisfying by your sorrow? Now you are not to satisfy, but Christ. It
   is good to reflect upon wrath, to drive us to mercy; but it is not good
   to dwell always in the preparations, for that is to forget our errand,
   and to stay in the porch when we should enter into the temple. Labour
   to get an interest in him in whom dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead
   bodily.

   3. It reproveth such as would have peace, but not this way, but upon
   wrong grounds. Now that is an evil peace that cometh any other way.
   Look to the grounds of your peace. How came you to such a peaceable
   frame of heart? The false grounds are:--

   [1.] Ignorance of our condition. A man doth not fear danger till he be
   sensible of it. Now many do not know that God and they are at such
   terms of distance and anger. Little doth a man trouble himself when he
   doth not know what evil is determined against him: Rom. iii. 11, There
   is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God, they
   have no understanding.' And it is easy to go hoodwinked to hell.
   Blinded sinners go merrily to the pit of destruction, never dreaming
   that danger was so near hand. Poor souls that do not know the worst by
   themselves! This is the greatest judgment that can be fall them.

   [2.] Carelessness in others. When men cannot put off sorrow, they put
   it by, and will not so much as reflect upon themselves. You may know it
   is bad with men when they cannot endure to look inward. Things that are
   evil cannot brook a trial; men will put all care out of their hearts as
   to their eternal concerns.

   [3.] When men avoid whatever may put them in mind of their misery.
   There are two things that humble men, doing of duty and striving
   against sin.

   (1.) Doing of duty seriously, that will make men see what profane,
   unsavoury, and senseless spirits they have. A man that lieth abed doth
   not feel his lame leg, but when he goeth to walk upon it he does.
   Exercise the soul in inward duties, and you will see it diseased. We
   know things when we come to make trial of them: therefore, wicked men
   will not meddle in inward and hearty duties, lest thereby they should
   discover the soul to itself. Formal duties make men the more secure:
   they are thereby apt to think better of themselves than they ought. The
   pharisee thought himself in a good case, because of his vain fasting,
   giving alms, and paying tithes. So formal duties are a vain refuge. But
   now duties wholly spiritual, and spiritually performed, make men see
   the weakness and wickedness of their spirits; but they are looked upon
   as such a disturbance to wicked men that they cannot endure to hear of
   them.

   (2.) Resisting of sin. Tumult is caused by opposition. When a man
   tamely yieldeth to Satan, no wonder if he be let alone. The devil
   rageth most when we set against him: Rev. xii. 12, For the devil is
   come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath
   but a short time.' Dying beasts bite shrewdly. Oh, how is the poor soul
   tortured with sin, when it is about to quit it! The sea doth not rage
   so much when the wind and the tide go together. Please the worst
   natures and they will not disturb you. This is a peace that will end in
   trouble: there will be a quarrelling between affections and convictions
   when a sinner cometh to be serious and thoughtful.

   [4.] When men do what they can to divert all care and minding of their
   condition: this is like a few stolen waters, when they can get
   conscience asleep. As it is said, Prov. ix. 17, Stolen waters are
   sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.' They lull the soul
   asleep by pleasures, or distract it by business. They never keep the
   heart empty that they may enter into themselves. As Cain built cities,
   so carnal men drown themselves in business or pleasures.

   Use 2. Is direction, to teach us what to do if we would have peace when
   our consciences are enraged. Go to Christ; the chastisement of our
   peace was upon him. Get an interest in Christ, and you have an interest
   in God. God is not to be had as a friend without Christ. Get him and
   you are presently interested in God's favour. For he that has the Son
   hath the Father also.'

   But, you will say, how shall I get an interest in Christ? I answer--in
   one word--By faith; that is the way to get Christ to you with all his
   benefits; and, therefore, faith is expressed by receiving Christ: John
   i. 12, To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
   sons of God;' and Eph. iii. 17, Christ is said to dwell in our hearts
   by faith.' You must say, in the language of faith here, The
   chastisement of our peace was upon him.' Those that offered a
   peace-offering were to lay their hands upon the head of the sacrifice,
   which implieth a kind of joining. So Christ is the peace-offering, and
   you must lay your hands upon his head. When Thomas believed, he cried,
   My Lord and my God.' That gives your souls the possession of Christ;
   and if of Christ, of God. But briefly I might from this speak to two
   sorts of persons:--

   1. To secure sinners.

   2. To poor broken-hearted sinners that labour under the sense of wrath.
   But having spoken from several passages of Christ's sufferings for
   them, and more remaining to be insisted on from other verses, I shall
   now only speak a little to secure sinners. I shall press them to two
   things:--

   [1.] To consider their condition; and,

   [2.] The danger of their condition.

   [1.] Consider your condition. You are. in a state of enmity with God;
   God is at war with you. That this may appear to you, weigh these things
   following:--

   (1.) That your condition is not to be measured by your present feeling
   and apprehension. A man may be in danger, though he be not sensible of
   it: Isa. lvii. 21, There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked: they
   are like a troubled sea when it cannot rest.' The wicked do not think
   so, but my God saith so. It is what God speaketh to you, not what you
   think of yourselves. Wicked men's lives slide away in pastimes, and
   pomp, and pleasure; but still they are under continual danger, though
   they mind it not. Mark that expression; 2 Peter ii. 3, it is said,
   Their damnation slumbereth not.' Though they slumber, their damnation
   doth not slumber. If men could make their condemnation sleep as well as
   themselves, it were well. Do not measure your estate by your own
   thoughts, but by God's heart towards you, how he looketh upon you in
   Christ. God may be angry with you and you not know it.

   (2.) Remember that God is angry with every man in his natural
   condition. Till you get an interest in Christ, you have not God for a
   Father. There is a war between God and every natural man. Those that
   think themselves at peace with God from their cradles upwards, never
   were at peace with him. You are at peace with God, you say, when you
   are at war with him. The scripture speaks otherwise of you: Eph. ii. 2,
   You are children of wrath, even as others.' And, John iii. 36, The
   wrath of God abideth on them.' This you must take for granted. There
   was a time when you were fallen out with God and God with you, even as
   well as others those that embraced the Christian profession, as well as
   Turks and pagans. We are indeed estranged from the womb, but we are not
   reconciled from the womb, Ps. lviii. 3; therefore, whatever you think,
   you must conclude that God is angry till you can get him pacified in
   Christ.

   (3.) There are expressions of this anger and enmity that pass between
   God and the soul, though we do not take notice of it.

   (1st.) On our part there are a great many expressions of our enmity to
   God; as hatred of his being, wishing he were not, slighting of his
   ordinances, rebellion against his laws, a rising of heart against his
   servants; a rancorous tumult, and rebellious storming in our affections
   against his providence; a vexing that he doth so thwart us in our ways
   and courses. This is our war. Then vexing and grieving his blessed
   Spirit. God hath told us what will grieve him, and yet, contrary to all
   the motions of his blessed Spirit, and the checks of our own
   consciences, we will go on our own way. As Esau took a wife from the
   daughters of Heth, which was a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah, Gen.
   xxvi. 35.

   (2dly.) From God to us. There are some flashes of wrath, and opening of
   our consciences, fears of hell, horrors, Hosea ii. 6. Hedging up our
   ways with thorns, and making a wall that we should not find our paths,
   which maketh us to vex and storm when we cannot have as much as we
   desire. So likewise by turning all providences into a snare, cursing
   all ordinances to us. Now and then, I say, God discovereth much wrath
   to the soul, that it cannot but see it. Oh, then, labour to be sensible
   of your condition. You think to rub it out well enough, and yet you see
   there are many expressions of war between God and you.

   [2.] Consider the danger of your condition. Oh, it is a sad thing to be
   at war with God. If a man were at war with one with whom he were able
   to make his party good, it were no such matter; but this you can never
   do with God. Foolish man thinketh so, and therefore the apostle saith,
   1 Cor. x. 22, Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than
   he?' Will ye act so flatly against his commandments, as if you thought
   you should be able to bear out yourselves in the transgression? That
   you may not think so, consider:--

   (1.) He it is that upholdeth you in your beings, and he can resolve you
   into nothing, as easily as he could create you out of nothing. Solomon
   saith, Prov. xvi. 14, that the wrath of a king is as the messenger of
   death;' that is, you had as good have one to come and tell you that you
   shall die, as to come and tell you that a king is angry with you. A
   wrinkle in the brow of majesty is as a grave to you. If men were
   sensible, it is much more true of the wrath of God; he can speak you
   out of your beings in an instant. It is said, Heb. i. 2, He upholdeth
   all things by the word of his power.' And would a man be angry with him
   that is able to speak him into nothing? Now thus it is with God.

   (2.) Besides his power, consider the whole creation taketh part with
   God; and when he pleaseth he is able to arm the meanest creatures
   against you. As he said that would not dispute with a king, I have
   learned not to contend with him that is able to command legions;' so
   should we say, that we will not contend with God, that is able to
   command the creatures. The meanest worm is able to revenge God's
   quarrel against you. Sometimes God declareth his power against his
   enemies by frogs, flies, mean contemptible things, as we read
   concerning the plagues of Egypt. So Herod was eaten up of worms, Acts
   xii. 23; and Pope Adrian was choked with a gnat. I would not willingly
   expatiate on these things, to offer only matter to your fancies, but
   beseech you to weigh it in your thoughts. God might kill you with the
   least fly that hummeth about you, and you have deserved it. It is not
   only the more dangerous things that can do man hurt, but all things.
   Consider this, I pray you; God doth more eminently discover it to you,
   that you may consider it.

   (3.) If nobody else, yet God can make use of your own selves against
   yourselves. He need plague a man no worse than to open his own
   conscience against him. As Luther said, for a man to see but his own
   sins, is as great a hell as can be imagined. This hath made saints to
   roar, Ps. xxxii. 3. This dried up David's moisture, ver. 4. Spira would
   give all the world for one motion of the Spirit to make him believe
   what was proposed to him concerning Christ. See that expression, Job
   vi. 4, The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof
   drinketh up my spirits; the terrors of God do set themselves in array
   against me.' Just as a man runneth up and down in distraction that hath
   a poisoned arrow shot into his bowels. In the whole circuit of nature
   you cannot find one medicine that will heal this grief. All friends,
   comforts, and relations, are nothing, and all other troubles are but
   sport and recreation to these. Spiritual good and evil, both are not
   known till felt. Oh, consider how it will be with you when God shall
   bring out all those unclean thoughts, horrid oaths, lies, deceits that
   you have been guilty of. All shall be set on upon the heart, and you
   become a terror to yourselves.

   (4.) He is able to ruin you, body and soul, eternally; and so he will
   deal with all his enemies: Mat. xxi. 41, He will miserably destroy
   those wicked men.' Not only destroy, but miserably destroy. Many are
   encouraged in their attempts, that if they be ruined, it is but their
   fortune, there is the worst of it. Now he is able to destroy you so as
   you shall not know the worst of it; he is able to sink you below all
   happiness of being or subsistence. Oh, consider the end of those whose
   peace is not made with God! Judgments without measure, most extreme and
   exquisite sufferings without mitigation, not a drop of cold water to
   cool the tongue; judgment without mercy.

   By his stripes we are healed.

   Doct. That the healing of our natures, as well as peace and
   reconciliation with God, is the fruit of Christ's sufferings. Three
   things are here to be taken notice of:--

   1. Healing puts us in mind of a disease incurable by human art, or any
   remedies that are in our power.

   2. Health implieth our recovery out of this disease, or our salvation
   by Christ.

   3. The means of this recovery is by Christ's stripes.

   First, For the disease.

   1. The soul hath its diseases as well as the body, and may be in a good
   or ill plight, as well as the body. It is in a good plight when it is
   fit to serve God or enjoy him. It is in an ill plight, or diseased,
   when it is disabled for these ends. The diseases therefore of the soul
   are those inordinate dispositions by which it is hindered from bringing
   forth actions agreeable or belonging to the spiritual life. This came
   to pass by Adam's sin, which, according to the tenor of the first
   covenant, is imputed to all those who were naturally propagated from
   him, they being thereupon deprived of original righteousness; whereby
   we became blind in our minds, perverse in our hearts, and so sold under
   sin; and till we be freed by the grace of God, we cannot but act
   sinfully, and daily contract and strengthen evil habits and
   inclinations. Therefore the work of conversion is expressed by healing:
   Isa. vi. 10, And convert and be healed.' When these distempers and
   perverse inclinations of the soul are done away, we are healed,
   otherwise we lie under the power of a blind mind, and a hard heart, a
   guilty conscience and carnal affections, which are as so many deadly
   wounds and diseases of the soul.

   2. The diseases of the soul are greater than those of the body, as
   being seated in the nobler part, and so the wound is the more grievous.
   As a cut in the body is worse than a rent in the clothes, so is a wound
   in the soul more grievous than a cut in the body. The diseases of the
   body tend only to the death of the body, which of itself must
   necessarily die: Eccles. xii. 7, Then shall the dust return to the
   earth as it was;' and then by the power of God shall certainly rise
   again. But the diseases of the soul, as they make us unuseful to God
   for the present, so they tend to eternal destruction and death both of
   body and soul for ever: Mat. x. 28, But rather fear him that is able to
   destroy both body and soul in hell.'

   3. I assert that sin is the great sickness of the soul. There are two
   sorts of diseases in the soul:--

   [1.] Terrors, or spiritual bondage, by which the soul is driven from
   God, and cannot think of him, or seek after him, with any comfort or
   peace. And this is a sore and evil disease indeed, for the curing of
   which Christ also came; for it is said, Ps. cxlvii. 3, He hath healed
   the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds;' Luke iv. 18, He hath
   sent me to heal the broken-hearted.' Which he doth by pardon or peace,
   the former benefit mentioned in this verse.

   [2.] Sins, or evil habits and inclinations, which disable us from
   pleasing of God. These are the worst sort of diseases, as being the
   cause of the other; for terrors entered into the world with sin. When
   Adam had sinned against God he was afraid of him, and ran to the
   bushes, Gen. iii. 8-10. And when sin is taken away, the others cease.
   Now that sin is the great sickness and wound of the soul, I shall prove
   by these considerations:--

   First, It is a wasting disease; it bringeth the soul into a languishing
   condition, and wasteth the strength of it. Therefore our natural estate
   is described to be an estate without strength: Rom. v. 6, When we were
   yet without strength, Christ died for us;' that is, without strength to
   help ourselves out of that misery into which sin had plunged us. Sin
   hath weakened the soul in all the faculties of it, which all may
   discern and observe in themselves. The mind is weakened; for how acute
   and discerning soever it be in earthly things, it is stupid and dull in
   things spiritual and heavenly. We see little of the danger of eternal
   damnation, or the worth of eternal salvation, or the need of Christ, or
   the serious preparation for the world to come: 2 Peter i. 9, He that
   lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off.' These things,
   that is, faith and other graces of the Spirit. And then the memory is
   weakened; it is true and faithful in retaining what is evil, but
   slippery and treacherous in what is good. These things we easily let
   slip, as leaky vessels do the liquor contained in them: Heb. ii. 1,
   Therefore we ought to give the more diligent heed to the things which
   we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.' Our will is
   fixedly inclined to evil, and averse to good: Their heart is fully set
   in them to do evil,' Eccles. viii. 11. The affections are like tinder,
   apt to catch fire at the spark of every temptation: Prov. vii. 22, He
   goeth after her straightway.' But they are like wet wood as to the
   entertainment of any heavenly motion: 1 Cor. ii. 14, The natural man
   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know
   them, because they are spiritually discerned.' Therefore sin hath made
   fearful havoc in the soul, and destroyed the strength and right
   constitution of it. The strength of man lieth not in the robust,
   healthy temper of his body; that is a brutish strength, and a bull or
   an ox exceedeth us in that; nor merely in the strength of natural
   parts, for therein many pagans excel many Christians: but it lies in
   the strength of grace, strength to overcome temptations to sin, to
   govern our passions and affections, to do the things which God
   commandeth, that is strength indeed, the strength of the inward man.
   See, on the other side, man's proper strength described, Prov. xvi. 32,
   He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth
   his spirit, than he that taketh a city.' On the other side see weakness
   described, Ezek. xvi. 30, How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord God,
   seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish
   woman!' That is a weak heart that lieth open to every temptation; that
   is at the beck of every foolish and hurtful lust, as pride, sensuality,
   worldliness, carnal fear and sorrow. An imperious heart is a weak
   heart, and this weakness sin hath brought upon us.

   Secondly, It is a painful disease, it woundeth the spirit; and a
   wounded spirit who can bear? Prov. xviii. 14. Greatness of mind may
   support us under a wounded body, but when there is a breach made upon
   the conscience, what can relieve us then? Take either a tender
   conscience, or a raging, stormy conscience, for an instance to show
   what sin is. Ask of Cain and Judas, and they will tell you what horror
   and anguish it breedeth in the soul, what storms and tempests it
   raiseth in the mind: Gen. iv. 13, My iniquity is greater than I can
   bear.' Their lives, yea, all their comforts, are a burden to them. Nay,
   ask any man whose heart is well awaked, and he will tell you, that the
   sense of the guilt of sin is bitterer to the soul than the gall of
   asps, and that no tortures are comparable to the piercing stings of an
   accusing conscience. Even holy David could say, Ps. xxxviii. 1-3, Lord,
   rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
   For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thine hand presseth me sore.
   There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger, neither is
   there any rest in my bones because of my sin.' If this holy man, whose
   heart was upright with God, did thus complain, what should they do who
   are nothing else but wounds and putrified sores from the crown of the
   head to the sole of the foot? We think a man in a fever is in a
   miserable condition, who hath little rest day or night: but alas!
   feverish flames are nothing to the scorchings of conscience, and the
   fearful apprehensions of divine wrath: they that are under these are
   miser able indeed, because the pains of hell do compass them round
   about, and wherever they go, they carry their own hell along with them.

   Object. But you will say, They that are most infected with sin feel
   little of this; how is it then so painful a disease?

   Ans. 1. If they feel it not, the greater is their danger; for stupid
   diseases are the worst, and usually most mortal. It is an ill crisis
   and state of soul when men are past feeling: Eph. iv. 19, Who, being
   past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness.' These have
   out grown their consciences. There is hope of sensible sinners; their
   anguish may drive them to the physician, and make them inquisitive
   after a remedy: Acts ii. 37, When they heard this, they were pricked in
   their hearts, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men and
   brethren, what shall we do?' But it is more dangerous when sins do not
   terrify but stupefy. A spiritual lethargy is the common disease that
   ruineth the far greatest part of the world.

   2. The soul of a sinner never sits so easy but that he has his qualms
   and pangs of conscience, and that sometimes in the midst of jollity; as
   was the case of Belshazzar, while carousing in the cups of the temple.
   Certainly they feel enough to show that if they were cured of this
   disease, it would be a great comfort and felicity to them; their best
   pleasures are but stolen waters, and bread eaten in secret, poor
   sneaking delights, when they can get conscience asleep.

   3. Though they feel not their diseases now, they shall hereafter. Oh,
   what a pain will sin be to them when God awakeneth them, either in this
   life, by letting a spark of his wrath fall into the conscience, and
   then they become a terror to themselves; or, if not here, yet in hell
   hereafter, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth!

   Thirdly, It is a loathsome disease. The pain of sin, which worketh upon
   our fear, is first and soonest felt: but the loathsomeness of sin,
   which worketh on our shame, requireth a quicker and more tender sense.
   As a man overgrown with noisome boils and sores, is first affected with
   the pain caused by them, and then with the sight and smell of them; so
   it is with soul-distempers: Ps. xxxviii. 5, My wounds stink and are
   corrupt, because of my foolishness;' and ver. 7, My loins are filled
   with a loathsome disease.' The soul abhors, and is ashamed of itself,
   when it hath anything of tenderness, or lively sense of the purity of
   God. Solomon telleth us that a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to
   shame,' Prov. xiii. 5. How loathsome? He is loathsome to God, who is of
   purer eyes than to behold iniquity,' Hab. i. 13. Loathsome to good men,
   who can no more delight in him than a sound man can in the conversation
   of a leper: Prov. xxix. 27, An unjust man is an abomination to the
   just.' Loathsome to indifferent men, for those that can allow sin in
   themselves dislike it in others: Titus iii. 3, Hateful and hating one
   another.' Another's pride, sensuality, and worldliness, is offensive to
   us. Though we be proud, sensual, and worldly ourselves, yet it is an
   offence to ourselves; therefore a sinner dareth not converse with his
   own heart, but doth what he can to fly from himself, to divert his
   thoughts from the sight of his own natural face in the glass of the
   word, as being ashamed of himself and his own ways: Rom. vi. 21, What
   fruit had ye then of those things whereof ye are now ashamed?' However
   it is enough for our purpose, if loathsome to God: Ps. xiv. 2, 3, the
   psalmist telleth us, The Lord looked down from heaven.' And what did he
   see here below? They are altogether become filthy and abominable.' All
   their persons, all their actions flowing forth from their corrupt
   hearts, are vile and loathsome in God's sight. When God looked upon his
   creatures just as they passed his hand, all was very good, Gen. i. 31.
   But when once they were infected with sin, the case is altered, they
   are all become filthy and abominable; some more, some less gross, as to
   the outbreaking of sin; but they are all odious to God, and we are
   sensible of it, as appeareth by our shyness of God, and backwardness to
   look him in the face.

   Fourthly, It is an infectious and catching disease. Sin cometh into the
   world by propagation rather than imitation: yet imitation and example
   hath a great force upon the soul: Eph. ii. 3, kata` to`n aiona, Among
   whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our
   flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by
   nature the children of wrath, even as others;' Isa. vi. 5, Woe is me,
   for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among
   a people of unclean lips.' Living among such, he had contracted some
   contagion and taint. It is hard to converse with wicked ones and not to
   be defiled: Micah i. 9, Her wound is incurable, for it is come into
   Judah.' Samaria was desperately sick of provocations, and the taint
   reached to Judah also.

   Fifthly, It is a mortal disease if we continue in it without
   repentance, for by sin came death' into the world, Rom. v. 12; and the
   wages of sin is death.' Rom. vi. 23. Not only death temporal, which
   consists in the separation of the soul from the body, but death
   spiritual, which consists in an estrangement from God, as the author of
   the life of grace; yea, death eternal, which consists in a separation
   both of body and soul from the presence of God for ever, and is a
   perpetual living in deadly pain and torment. The second death is set
   forth by two notions--the worm that never dieth,' and the fire that
   shall never be quenched,' Mark ix. 44; by which is meant the sting of
   conscience and the wrath of God. Conscience worketh on what is past,
   present, and to come. There is a vexing remembrance of what is past,
   your past folly and evil choice, past neglects of grace, past misspense
   of time, past abuse of mercies, past despising of the offered
   salvation. Oh, what cutting thoughts will these be to the damned to all
   eternity! There is a sense of what is present; they have nothing to
   divert their thoughts from their misery, no company nor sensual
   comforts, but are left to the bitter apprehension of their sad estate.
   There is also a fear of what is to come, or a fearful looking for of
   more wrath from God. The fire is the wrath of God, which inflicts pains
   upon the damned both in body and soul. There is no member or faculty
   free, but feeleth the misery of the second death. The agonies of the
   first death are soon over, but those of the second endure for ever. The
   first death is the more terrible because of this death which is to
   succeed it. In the first death our struggling is for life, we would not
   die; but here, for death and destruction, we would not live. This is
   the fruit of sin.

   Secondly, Our recovery out of sin, and all the effects of it, which is
   our health. Before the application of the blood of Christ, every man in
   his natural estate is in no less dangerous a condition than a man that
   is wounded and bleeding to death: Luke x. 30, A certain man went down
   from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him of
   his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.' Not
   as if he had any spiritual life at all, but it is spoken in respect to
   his natural life. So before Christ's blood is applied, every man is
   dead spiritually, and is posting towards eternal death; but when he is
   regenerated and converted to God, then he is translated from death to
   life. Therefore this healing must be considered--

   1. As to its nature.

   2. With respect to the several periods of this benefit, as to its
   beginning, progress, and final consummation.

   1 The nature of this cure, or health bestowed upon us, will be best
   understood by considering what is in sin. There are in sin four
   things--culpa, macula, reatus, poena.

   [1.] Culpa. The fault is the criminal action, which is the foundation
   of our guilt. Now this properly is not healed, but passed by, or not
   brought into judgment against us, for as it is an action it cannot be
   reversed. Factum infectum fieri nequit. As it is a criminal action
   against the law of God, it cannot lose its nature, for Christ came not
   to make a fault to be no fault. This properly is not healed. Indeed
   some phrases express pardon but by a passing by: Micah vii. 18, That
   pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of
   his heritage.' The Lord passeth over the fault, or quits the plea
   towards them that own their faults. The Lord seeth them, and not seeth
   them; that is, will not lay them to their charge: Isa. lvii. 18, I have
   seen his ways, and will heal him;' that is, not enter into judgment
   with him. In short, the fault is not disannulled, but passed over, and
   cast behind God's back. The offender is not made innocent, but
   pardonable on certain terms. We must remember the fault, but God
   forgets it.

   [2.] Here is macula, which is the blot or inclination to sin again. So
   he healeth us by sanctification, renewing and cleansing us by the
   .Spirit, which is the work of God: Exod. xv. 26, I am the Lord that
   healeth thee.' This is most properly his healing grace. So God reneweth
   and healeth our natures: Ps. ciii. 3, Who forgiveth all thine
   iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases.'

   [3.] There is reatus, the guilt or obligation to punishment. God
   dissolveth this by his sovereign authority, according to his new
   covenant: 2 Chron. xxx. 20, The Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed
   the people.' There was no actual stroke or judgment upon them, but
   healing--there is dissolving the guilt. He forgave their sin, or
   remitted the penalty which they had incurred by eating the passover
   otherwise than it was written.

   [4.] There is poena, the punishment, which is external, internal, or
   eternal. The external punishment is affliction. This is the wound that
   sin maketh in us. This wound God healeth by restoring prosperity: Hosea
   vi. 1, Come, let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will
   heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up;' 2 Chron. vii. 14, I
   will forgive their sin, and heal their land.' The internal punishment
   consists in trouble of conscience, or the anguish and pain occasioned
   by the fear of God's wrath, which he healeth: Ps. vi. 2, Have mercy
   upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
   vexed;' Ps. xli. 4, Lord, be merciful unto me, and heal my soul; for I
   have sinned against thee.' As to eternal, or the mortal wound of sin,
   he healeth that by reversing the sentence of eternal death, and
   bestowing upon us eternal life, that from children of wrath we may be
   made heirs of glory. This grant is the true balsam for a wounded soul,
   when it is not only freed from the fears of the flames of hell and the
   sting of death, but made heir according to the hope of eternal life. If
   God and heaven be not matter of comfort, I know not what is. This is
   the portion of one that believeth in Christ.

   2. The several periods of this benefit.

   [1.] The cure is begun when we repent and believe, and so are renewed
   and reconciled to God; then the danger of death is over: John v. 24, He
   that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath
   everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed
   from death to life.' The disease will not prove mortal.

   [2.] It is carried on by degrees, as he doth sanctify us more and more
   by his Spirit, and settles us in the peace of the gospel. Christ is
   still in hand with the cure: Mal. iv. 2, The Sun of righteousness shall
   arise upon you with healing in his wings, and ye shall go forth and
   grow up like calves in the stall.' Increase of grace and joy in the
   Holy Ghost is our continued healing. Dangerous sores and deadly wounds
   are not so soon cured. We have defects and distempers which disable us
   for duty, but the healing virtue prevaileth more and more. The wicked
   grow more and more diseased, and in the godly there are some ups and
   downs; but the Lord promiseth to heal our backslidings: Hosea xiv. 4, I
   will heal your back sliding, and I will love you freely; for mine anger
   is turned away from you.' He will take away more and more the guilt,
   pollution, and other effects of sin.

   [3.] Our state of perfect health is in heaven; there is our complete
   and eternal welfare, when sin and misery shall be no more. Therefore
   heaven is set forth by the tree of life which groweth in the midst of
   paradise, and beareth twelve manner of fruits, and yieldeth its fruit
   every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
   nations,' Rev. xxii. 2; and ver. 14, it is said, Blessed are they that
   do his commandments, that they may have a right to eat of the tree of
   life, and may enter in through the gates into the city;' that is into
   the happiness of the saints in glory. These enter into the New
   Jerusalem, and are there fully healed.

   Thirdly, The means of our recovery is by Christ's stripes.

   1. None but Christ can cure us, for he is the physician of souls--all
   else are physicians of no value. Sin is the disease, the, Redeemer's
   grace the medicine, and salvation is our health.; and then it is
   perfect when we are fully saved from sin, and all the consequents of
   it. Now this is above the sinner's cure, till God himself takes us in
   hand. Christ is the Sun of righteousness, who hath healing in his
   wings, and hath set forth himself under the notion of a physician: Mat.
   ix. 12, The whole need not the physician, but they that are sick.' This
   sore sickness can be cured by no other hand. And the proper nature of
   his grace is to be medicinal, that is, a healing dispensation.

   2. Christ cureth us not by doctrine and example only, but by merit and
   suffering; for it is said in the text, We are healed by his stripes. I
   confess the doctrine of Christ hath a great tendency this way; for it
   is said, Prov. iv. 22, My word is life to them that find it, and health
   to their flesh.' There is the medicine for sick souls; there are our
   cordials and encouragements to prevent sinkings and despondences of
   spirit; there are potent arguments against distrustful cares and fears,
   excellent remedies against covetousness, sensuality, and pride;
   forcible dissuasions from unkind and unholy walking. In short, it is
   the common shop and storehouse against any distemper incident to the
   soul. The words of the Lord Jesus are wholesome words, but yet the
   virtue of the word mainly results from his merit and satisfaction: John
   xvii. 19, And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be
   sanctified through the truth;' and Eph. v. 25, 26, Christ loved the
   church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it
   with the washing of water by the word.' So his example hath a great
   force, seeing how prone the nature of man is to imitate. And this
   example is so much commended to us by his kindness and condescension in
   coming down to be subject to the same laws we live by, by the exactness
   of it, and the issue and consequent--life and immortality--into which
   he entered to give us a visible demonstration of the success of our
   obedience. But an example would nothing at all have profited those that
   are dead in sin and hated of God, if some other means had not been
   used. Compare 1 Peter ii. 21 with 24; For even hereunto were ye called,
   because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that we
   should follow his steps;' then ver. 24, Who his own self bare our sins
   in his own body upon the tree, that we, being dead to sin, should live
   unto righteousness, by whose stripes we are healed.' There needed grace
   to make example effectual: 2 Cor. iii. 18, We all with open face, be
   holding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same
   image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.'

   3. Christ's merit and sufferings do effect our cure, as they purchased
   the Spirit for us, who reneweth and healeth our sick souls: Titus iii.
   5, 6, Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according
   to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the
   renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through
   Jesus Christ our Saviour.' We have it by virtue of Christ's sufferings:
   Gal. iii. 13, 14, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,
   being made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that
   hangeth on a tree, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the
   Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the
   Spirit through faith.' So in many other places. He is powerful to
   change our hearts, and to take away sin. Our wound is not in curable.
   The Spirit of God can and will heal the diseased soul. God's justice
   being satisfied in Christ, he is at more liberty now to dispense his
   grace.

   Use 1. Is for reproof, and that to divers sorts; as--

   1. Those that are not sensible of their deadly wounds and the diseases
   of their souls. There is a carelessness and insensibility in most of
   soul diseases. If the body be but ill at ease, they complain presently,
   and seek help for their bodies, but never think of the languishing
   condition of their souls, and how lamentably distempered they are. They
   are hard by death's door, on the brink of destruction, yet are merry
   and laugh, lay not their condition to heart; nay, think it an injury
   done them, if you mind them of their cure. Though they are spiritually
   sick, yet they will not know nor acknowledge it, but, like persons of a
   distempered brain, who take the physician for an enemy, they murmur at
   and resist all Christ's healing methods, as if their duty were their
   torment, and not their disease. These are in love with their diseases:
   John iii. 19, This is the condemnation, that light is come into the
   world, and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are
   evil.'

   2. Some would have peace and comfort by Christ, but neglect healing;
   whereas both were purchased by him, and both must be regarded by us. We
   should aim at a sound cure, not to have the grief assuaged only, but
   the distemper removed. It is a mountebank's cure to stop the pain and
   let alone the cause; yet such a cure do they seek after that are more
   earnest for ease and comfort than grace. A good Christian is troubled
   with the strength of sin, as well as the guilt of it, and mindeth the
   rectitude of all his faculties as well as the ease and peace of his
   conscience, that he may be enabled to walk with God cheerfully, in the
   way of holiness, as well as enjoy the pardon of sins: 1 John i. 9, He
   is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
   unrighteousness.' He would be an unwise man who, having his leg broken,
   should only mind to be eased of the pain, but not take care to have it
   set right again. So foolish is that Christian who is earnest for
   comfort, but taketh no care how to be directed and enabled to please
   God. Sin, in some sense, is worse than damnation.

   3. It reproveth those who think it impossible to get rid of their
   carnal distempers. Will you lessen the merit of Christ and the power of
   his Spirit, or doubt of the promise of God? Jer. iii. 22, Return, and I
   will heal you.' Now, upon these terms we should come to Christ with
   confidence, to be the better for coming: Jer. xvii. 14, Heal me, and I
   shall be healed.' God can heal, and he will; that is, he is ready to do
   it, or else why did he take this course?

   Use 2. Is to press us to come to God for healing. I shall give you a
   few directions.

   1. You must, in a broken-hearted manner, be sensible of your sickness.
   It is the sensible sinner Christ undertaketh to cure; the heart-whole
   are not within the compass of his commission: Luke v. 31, 32, They that
   are whole need not the physician, but they that are sick. I came not to
   call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.' A sense of our disease
   is a good step toward our cure. God will so heal that he will make us
   feel our sickness, that the smart of it may be a warning to us for the
   future, that we may not presume to offend again when we are recovered:
   Josh. xxii. 17, Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which
   we are not cleansed until this day?' We must not make too bold with
   God.

   2. We must by earnest prayer seek this blessing of God, for God will be
   entreated for all things which he meaneth to bestow: Isa. xix. 22, He
   shall be entreated of them, and he shall heal them;' Ps. xci. 14,
   Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him.'
   The leven of these distempers is so kneaded into the nature of man that
   it cannot be gotten out presently; therefore come often to God by
   prayer for healing, sometimes this, sometimes that distemper; now that
   our pride may be mortified, and anon our impatience; at another time
   our carnal fear, our sensuality; still praying as occasion requireth.
   We speed well at the throne of grace if we obtain the rid dance and
   abatement of any one spiritual disease.

   3. We must use God's means, viz.:--(1.) The word, which is our
   medicine: 2 Tim. i. 13, Hold fast the form of sound words which thou
   hast heard of me in faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.' Keep the
   soul healthy. (2.) The sacraments, they are a part of the medicinal
   dispensation, sealing the great benefits of God towards us, and our
   duty towards him, and so are a help against backsliding. (3.)
   Meditation on the death of Christ, not only as a price and ransom, but
   morally, as it represents the odiousness of sin, and also the love of
   Christ towards us. So that, out of gratitude to him, and kindness to
   ourselves, we are bound to abstain from sin for the future. Viscera
   patent per vulnera. By his stripes we see what we have deserved, and
   what Christ hath endured.

   4. When God is seriously dealing with us about a cure, and applying
   means of healing, let us take heed we do not lose the advantage and
   grow worse: Jer. li. 9, We would, have healed Babylon, but she would
   not be healed.' So of Sion it is said, Hosea vii. 1, When I would have
   healed Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered.' God is willing
   to offer us help to cure us of our sins, and affordeth us special means
   and excitations to that purpose. Now, when the waters are stirred, we
   should step in that we may be made whole; otherwise the disease is the
   more irritated, and breaketh out in a worse manner than it did before.
   The great Physician of souls must be carefully observed and constantly
   waited upon, and in time he will give us perfect ease and health.

   5. Take heed, when you are healed, of casting yourselves into new
   diseases: John v. 14, Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a
   worse thing come unto thee;' Heb. ix. 14, How much more shall the blood
   of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot
   to God, purge your consciences from dead works to serve the living
   God?'
     __________________________________________________________________

THE SIXTH VERSE.

   All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to his
   own way; and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquities of us all.

   IN this verse we have two things which ought to be matter of continual
   meditation to us all our days, to wit, our misery by sin, and our
   remedy by Christ.

   1. Our misery in the former clause; where--

   [1.] Our sin is charged upon us collectively in common: we have all
   gone astray.

   [2.] Distributively: every one to his own way. We all agree in turning
   aside from the right way of pleasing and enjoying of God; and we
   disagree, as each one hath a by-path of his own, some running after
   this lust, some after that, and so are not only divided from God, but
   divided from one another, while every one maketh his will his law.
   Velle suum cuique est, nec voto vivitur uno: several desires breed
   difference.

   2. The remedy provided against this misery: and the Lord hath laid upon
   him the iniquities of us all. The burden of sin, that would otherwise
   have ruined us, is cast upon Christ. The sheep wander and the shepherd
   is slain. He is the good shepherd that layeth down his life for the
   sheep. David saith, 2 Sam. xxiv. 17, These sheep, what have they done?'
   David was more tender of his people than of himself, yet David was
   guilty. But here it is otherwise, for our iniquities were laid upon
   Christ. Here we may observe:--

   [1.] The author of this benefit, or who it was that provided this
   remedy for us: the Lord.

   [2.] The nature of the benefit: he laid our iniquities on him; that is,
   on Christ.

   [3.] The persons concerned: the iniquities of us all; all those that
   are at length gained to believe in him, and return to him, as the
   bishop and shepherd of their souls.

   First, I begin with the misery or the woeful case wherein all those for
   whom Christ died were in before conversion.

   1. They wandered in their ignorance and sinful ways to their own
   destruction, set forth by the going astray of sheep: All we, like
   sheep, are gone astray.' It is a usual similitude, which is not put
   here by way of extenuation, as in some scriptures, as I send you forth
   as sheep among wolves;' but in a way of aggravation, not to extenuate
   the sin, but to set it out the more. It is to show the folly of man.
   Sheep, of all creatures, are most apt to stray without a shepherd. They
   are apt either to be driven out of the fold as a dog or wolf scattereth
   the sheep, or to wander of their own accord, a fit emblem of our folly,
   who love to depart from God, and go astray from the way of life: Rom.
   iii. 12, They are all gone out of the way;' that is, the way to true
   happiness.

   2. They were unable to bring themselves into the right way: Luke xv.
   18, I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I
   have sinned against heaven, and before thee.' St Austin saith, Domine,
   errare per me potui, redire non potui--Lord, I could go astray of my
   own accord, but could not return by myself.

   3. In hazard to be preyed upon by the roaring lion, and the dogs and
   wolves that are abroad: 1 Peter v. 8, Be sober, be vigilant, because
   your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom
   he may devour.' Our misery is mentioned to show the necessity of a
   Saviour; and this misery is made to consist in sin or straying from
   God; the sense of which is our first motive to make us look after
   Christ, that we by him may return again to our own happiness, even to
   God, who is the refuge of our souls, and the centre of our rest. But
   let us more nearly observe how our misery is described. And first of
   the universal particle, all we; and then of the distributive particle,
   every one.

   First, From the universal particle all, we may observe:--

   Doct. 1. That no son of Adam can exempt himself from the number of
   those that are gone astray from God and the way of true happiness. I
   shall explain the point in these considerations:--

   First, All are sinners by nature. There are three branches of original
   sin:--

   1. The communication of Adam's guilt.

   2. The want of original righteousness.

   3. The corruption or pollution of nature. These are derived from Adam
   to all his children, and in respect of these they are all out of the
   way.

   1. Because the guilt of Adam's sin is imputed to us; his guilt we
   receive as children do the brand of their ancestors, that are tainted
   in blood and forfeited in law. Look, as Reuben's act in defiling his
   father's bed was a stain to all his posterity, and they lost the
   sovereignty by it, Gen. xlix. 4, so all mankind, being in Adam, as they
   descended from him, and were in him as in a common person, they sinned
   in him, so that what Adam did we did. Thus it is said, Heb. vii. 9,
   Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.' There is ground you
   see in nature for the imputation of the father's deed to those that
   descend of him: and God may as justly impute to us Adam's sin as to
   Levi Abraham's paying of tithes. When Abraham did it, it was as if Levi
   did it; and when Adam sinned, it was as if you sinned. We were all in
   his loins at that time; and, if it had been our personal case, we
   should have done so. Now this answer may satisfy as to the angels, that
   do not beget one another, and, therefore, sustain not the person of one
   another; their sins do not take hold of one another; they, being all
   immediately begotten by God, are not guilty of each others' sins,
   unless it be by consent and mutual agreement; therefore, those only
   fell that combined to follow one as the ringleader of the faction.
   Hence it is said, Mat. xxv. 41, The devil and his angels;' not as if
   begotten by him, but adhering to him. But to return, in pursuance of
   the former matter, note, the scripture looketh upon parents as
   sustaining a common person, and, therefore, what injury is done to the
   father, is spoken of as done to his seed; and many families suffer for
   the miscarriages of their progenitors: Gen. iv. 10. Thy brother's blood
   crieth unto me:' thou hast shed the blood of his offspring in spilling
   his, and, therefore, it is bloods, in the plural number. And so for
   Jacob and Esau, God elected them as sustaining the common persons of
   their posterity, and so likewise in many places. Now this holdeth good
   in man's justice, for treason in the father taints the blood of the
   son.

   2. The want of original righteousness, which cometh upon us thus. As
   poor and ignoble parents convey their poverty and want to their
   children, and none can give what he hath not. A bankrupt father must
   needs leave his family poor; so Adam, having lost his righteousness, he
   could not bequeath it as a legacy to his children.

   3. As to the corruption and pollution of nature, that is conveyed as a
   leprosy is propagated to the children of lepers: 2 Kings v. 27, The
   leprosy of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and to thy seed for ever;' so
   that every child born of that line was born a leper. Thus men be get
   children like themselves, corrupt and sinful; the copy answereth the
   original--the blood resembleth the kind. Of vipers there cometh nothing
   but vipers, and sinners produce sinners after their kind. If the
   immediate parent be sanctified, yet, that being not natural, doth not
   alter the case; from a circumcised father there doth not come a
   circumcised child,--threshed corn doth not produce threshed corn. But
   let us consider these branches a little more particularly.

   1. All men are sinners as they partake of Adam's guilt in being
   descended of him. As they sprang from him, they were in him as in a
   common person, and sinned in him; as Levi paid tithes in Abraham, as
   aforesaid, Heb. vii. 9. To be sure, sin and death came upon him and
   upon all: Rom. v. 12, Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the
   world, and death by sin, so that death passed upon all men, for that
   all have sinned.' If death, as is visible, then sin, even upon
   children: ver. 14, Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
   that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression.'
   Otherwise the apostle's reason would not be good and cogent, and there
   would be a punishment without a guilt: but ubi poena, ibi culpa. Yea,
   Rom. v. 19, For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so
   by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.' Made sinners is
   meant sensu forensi, in a law or court sense, by the imputation of
   Adam's guilt, as appeareth by the opposition. In short, those things
   are said to be imputed to us which are reckoned ours to all intents and
   purposes, as much as if they were our own. As another man's debt, taken
   on upon my score and account, is really and truly mine: so Adam's
   disobedience, and Christ's righteousness are imputed to all those whom
   they represented.

   2. They are sinners as they want original righteousness: Rom. iii. 23,
   For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.' By the glory
   of God may be meant his glorious recompenses, or his glorious image.
   The latter, questionless, is meant: 1 Cor. xi. 7, A man ought not to
   cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God; but the
   woman is the glory of man.' See also 2 Cor. iii. 18, But we all with
   open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed
   into the same image from glory to glory.' This necessarily maketh them
   sinners: for the soul being destitute of a principle to incline it to
   God, wholly accommodateth itself to the interests of the flesh, and is
   only employed to cater for the body and the bodily life; for, though it
   be created by God, yet being created destitute of grace and original
   righteousness, and put into the body, it soon forgets its divine
   original, and that region of spirits from whence it came, and
   conformeth itself to the body; as water put into a round or square
   vessel, taketh form from the vessel into which it is put. The soul doth
   only affect things present and known, having no other principle to
   guide it. Now things present and known are the delights of the body and
   bodily life, such as meat, drink, natural generation, sports, wealth,
   honour, and pomp of living. And the soul is turned from the love and
   study of better things. That self-love that carrieth us to these things
   is naturally good but morally evil, as it destroys the love of God, and
   the care of pleasing and enjoying him. There is a conversion from God
   to the creature, a falling off from our last end.

   3. There is pollution or corruption of nature, the stock of sin which
   we have inbred in us, consisting in a blind mind, perverse will,
   disorderly affections, an unruly appetite, and evil inclinations to
   sensual things. This corruption is often spoken of in scripture: Ps.
   li. 5, Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother
   conceive me;' John iii. 6, That which is born of the flesh is flesh.'
   We all partake of the same carnal nature, the dunghill of corruption,
   which wreaketh out in the mind by vain thoughts, in the heart by carnal
   desires, and constantly discovereth itself by a proneness to all evil:
   Gen. vi. 5, the imaginations and the thoughts of his heart are evil,
   and that continually.' An aversion from and enmity to all that is good:
   Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is enmity against God, and is not subject
   to the law, neither indeed can be.' Man, in respect to that which is
   good, is described not only by terms that imply weakness, but hostility
   and opposition, as unfit for every good work, and so opposite to it:
   Col. i. 21, Alienated and enemies in your minds by wicked works.' If a
   man were indifferent to good and evil, a neuter and not a rebel, the
   case were the less; but the bent of his heart is against it, as
   appeareth not only by scripture but experience. There is a proneness,
   and a greater inclination to evil than to good. Now, from whence should
   it come? Not by example, for then this inclination would not discover
   itself so early, and children would be as capable of good as evil. We
   catch a disease from the sick, but not health from the sound. We find a
   manifest disproportion in all our faculties. In the understanding, a
   sharpness of apprehension in carnal things, but a dulness and slowness
   to conceive of what is spiritual--the will is backward and slow to what
   is good, but there is a strong bent and urging in it to what is evil.
   We need a bridle to curb and restrain us from evil, and a spur to
   excite and quicken us to good. Evil things persevere and continue with
   us. Oh, but how fickle and changeable are we in any holy matter! The
   memory is slippery in what is good, firm and strong in what is evil,
   the affections quick, and easily stirred; like fire in tinder, they
   catch presently what is evil, but are cold and dead, like fire in wet
   or green wood, to anything that is good. The body is unwieldy for any
   holy use, but ready to execute any carnal purpose. In short, there is
   the seed of all actual transgressions before it break forth; so that we
   are gone astray and out of the way indeed. This should be minded by us.
   Nothing inferreth so much a contra diction to God as our being sinners
   by nature. This is a standing enmity; actual sin is a blow and away, a
   fit of anger, this a state of malice. Surely, we had need look to a
   redeemer and a change by regeneration, that are so corrupt and fleshly
   in all the powers and faculties both of soul and body. This secludeth
   us from any possibility of attaining heaven and true happiness.

   Secondly, All that come to the use of reason have actually sinned
   against God. The bad: 1 Kings viii. 46, For there is no man that
   sinneth not.' The good: Eccles. vii. 20, For there is not a just man
   upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.' Our nature, being
   unsubdued, discovereth itself in acts suitable: Gen. viii. 21, For the
   imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, and that
   continually.' Though there be mixtures and intermissions, and though
   this corruption be in part broken, yet it is not wholly vanquished; as
   cloth dyed in the wool doth not easily leave its first mixture.
   Principles in the best are mixed, so are their operations, like fair
   water passing through a dirty sink. Bonum non est nisi ex integro--not
   so purely good, as merely evil before. The best are either overtaken,
   Gal. vi. 1, or over borne, Rom. vii. The saints in heaven are called
   spirits made perfect.' Heb. xii. 23. They sin no more; but here we come
   very short of that exact obedience which the law requireth: Prov. xx.
   9, Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?'
   They have entered upon the work of cleansing their hearts, but cannot
   get them quite clean, but still go on with the work, and make use of
   the blood of Christ. Though none accuse them, yet God and their own
   hearts may justly condemn them for many sinful swervings from their
   duty.

   Thirdly, This departing from God and his ways is fitly represented by
   the straying of sheep: All we like sheep have gone astray.'

   In the general it implieth:--

   1. That we are brutish in our sin and defection from God: it could not
   be expressed but by a comparison fetched from the beasts; we were like
   sheep led aside in a sensual way. Man aimed at being equal with God,
   and he was made beneath himself: Ps. xlix. 12, Nevertheless, man being
   in honour, abideth not; he is like the beasts that perish.' He
   continued not in the honour of his creation, and in that excellency and
   dignity wherein God had set him; but became like a beast, governed by
   his senses and lower appetite. It is true of all men, they do not
   continue in the excellency of their being, they have lost much of the
   dignity of their reason, and are more led by sense, as the brute
   creatures are. And therefore you have the saints often complaining: Ps.
   lxxiii. 22, So foolish was I and ignorant, I was as a beast before
   thee.' I was as behemoth, a great beast. Sometimes they have no command
   of their affections, but are merely led by the unruliness of appetite
   or passions: so Prov. xxx. 2, I was more brutish than any man;' that
   is, he was no more able to gain heavenly knowledge, whereby to be wise
   for heaven and salvation, than brute creatures are able to wield man's
   reason, whereby to apply themselves to the affairs of this life.
   Therefore man is often compared to beasts for fierceness and cruelty,
   as the prophet calleth the proud oppressors cows: Amos iv. 3, And ye
   shall go out of the breaches, every cow at that which is before her.'
   So for their rude wanton simplicity, they are compared to a wild ass's
   colt,' Job xi. 12. And here to a sheep in decay of knowledge and
   government. In the general, then, it implieth something brutish in us,
   and that through the fall we have slipped beneath the excellency of our
   rank and being.

   2. Proneness to err. No creature is more prone to wander and lose his
   way than a sheep without a shepherd, which is easily seduced. So are we
   apt to transgress the bounds whereby God hath hedged up our way: Jer.
   xiv. 10, Thus saith the Lord unto this people, thus have they loved to
   wander.' They loved to try experiments in a way of sin. Man indeed
   would fain transmit the fault from himself, as Adam doth obliquely upon
   God: The woman which thou gavest me to be with me, she gave me of the
   tree, and I did eat,' Gen. iii. 12. It may not be the shepherd's fault
   if the sheep wander, but their own nature, their aptness to wander.
   When we bring ourselves into inconveniences, we are apt to murmur, and
   secretly to accuse God in our thoughts, as if he did not sufficiently
   provide for us. Solomon saith, Prov. xix. 3, The foolishness of man
   perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth against the Lord.' It is our
   own folly, and we blame our own fate, our evil destiny, and those
   unlucky stars that shone at our birth; and in these things we blame God
   himself. The saints themselves have been guilty of this evil, fretting
   at God for what inconvenience comes to pass through their own sin and
   folly. 2 Sam. vi. 8, it is said, David was displeased, because the Lord
   had made a breach upon Uzzah.' He should have been displeased with
   himself and his own ignorance, to order the ark to be carried upon a
   cart, when it should have been carried upon the priests' shoulders.
   Thus, as sheep, it noteth to us self-abasement, because of our own
   proneness: we did it as sheep, and they are apt to wander.

   3. Our inability to return, or to bring ourselves into the right way
   again. It is like a sheep, not like a swine or a dog; these creatures
   will find the way home again, but a sheep is irrecoverably lost without
   the shepherd's diligence and care: Jer. 1. 6, My people have been lost
   sheep, their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned
   them away on the mountains, they have gone from mountain to hill, they
   have forgotten their resting-place.' The farther they go the farther
   they will be from the flock, and in a very sad condition. It holdeth
   good too here; for we do not know the way back again to God. Austin
   saith, I could wander by myself, and could not return by myself. And
   God saith as much, Hosea xiii. 9, O Israel, thou hast destroyed
   thyself, but in me is thy help.' That is done in a moment which we
   cannot help to all eternity. Our destruction is from ourselves, but our
   reparation from God. The good shepherd bringeth home the lost sheep
   upon his shoulders, Luke xv. 5.

   4. It noteth our readiness to follow evil example. A sheep is animal
   sequax, they run one after another, and one straggler draweth away the
   whole flock: Eph. ii. 2, 3, Wherein in times past ye walked, according
   to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of
   the air, that now worketh in the children of disobedience: among whom
   also we had our conversation in times past, in the lust of our flesh,
   fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature
   the children of wrath even as others.' There is Satan, corrupt
   examples, and evil inclinations, the world and the flesh, all
   concurring to ruin man. We easily swim with the stream and current of
   others' examples, and do as they do; and even so men take and do a
   great deal of hurt by evil examples. Thus sins are propagated, and we
   live by imitation; like sheep, we draw others out of the pasture
   together with ourselves. Sheep go by troops, and so do men follow the
   multitude to do evil; and what is common passeth into our practice
   without observance.

   5. The danger of straying sheep, which when out of the pasture, are
   often in harm's way, and exposed to a thousand dangers: Jer. l. 6, 7,
   My people have been like lost sheep; all that have found them have
   devoured them.' So are we in danger to be preyed upon by the roaring
   lion, and the dogs and wolves that are abroad. In our sinful estate we
   are as sheep whom no man taketh up, being out of God's protection, and
   so a ready prey for Satan. See how pathetically the prophet describeth
   the misery of Israel: Hosea iv, 16, Now the Lord will feed them as a
   lamb in a large place.' Oh, consider what it is for a poor solitary
   lamb to wander through the mountains, where, it may be, some hungry
   lion and ravenous wolf looketh for such a prey. Even so it is with
   straying men, their judgment sleepeth not; it may be the next hour they
   will be delivered over to destruction: Rom. iii. 16, Destruction and
   misery is in their way, and the way of peace they have not known.'

   Use 1. Is to show us the necessity of a Redeemer. All are included
   under a necessity of looking after a remedy; if all be sick, they must
   all seek to the physician or perish. And therefore it concerneth every
   one to see what they have done for the saving of their lost souls. All
   the world is become guilty before God,' as the apostle saith, Rom. iii.
   19. Guilty you are, but have you sued out your discharge? By nature you
   lost the glory of God, but are you changed into the image and likeness
   of Christ from glory to glory? You were polluted in your first birth,
   but are you born again of water and the Spirit? Are you saved by being
   washed in the laver of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost,
   which he hath shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour?
   You are sinners by practice, but are you washed in the blood of the
   Lamb, and reconciled to God? You have gone astray, but is the case
   altered with you? 1 Peter ii. 25, For ye were as sheep going astray,
   but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls.' Do
   you use Christ as a mediator to seek the favour of God by him? Do you
   put yourselves into his hands as your Shepherd, and resign and give up
   yourselves to be governed by him as your bishop and overseer? As the
   misery involveth all, so doth the care and necessity of looking after a
   remedy concern all. In the first Adam we contracted guilt, and became
   liable to the wrath of God; in the second, we have righteousness, which
   is a pledge of God's favour. In the first Adam we lost the image of
   God; by the second, we are made partakers of the divine nature. In the
   first, we lost paradise; but by the second, are restored to a better
   paradise, heaven itself.

   But let us not reflect only upon this common necessity, but our own
   personal necessity, what need we have to look after a Redeemer, and to
   get an interest in him, and that his redeeming grace may become
   glorious in our eyes.

   1. In your natural estate you were every one of you as lost sheep,
   fugitives, and strangers, and enemies to him. Thy way was lost, thy God
   lost, thy happiness lost, thy soul lost; so it was, for Christ came to
   seek and to save that which was lost.' Then the devil was thy shepherd,
   then thou didst put thyself under his conduct, and God was looked upon
   as thy enemy. Oh, think of it; at a day old thou wert sinful, even to
   the death, and worthy of God's hatred: Col. i. 21, You were sometimes
   alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works.' And his wrath
   remaineth on you, till application be made of the blood of Christ upon
   gospel terms: John iii. 36, He that believeth not the Son, shall not
   see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.' These terms are
   repentance and turning to God. Now dost thou believe that thou wert a
   child of wrath by nature, a firebrand of hell? and canst thou be
   secure, and desirest thou not to be freed from so great a danger?

   2. In practice. How didst thou wander and depart from God throughout
   the whole course of thy life? The stragglings of thy youth, how canst
   thou look back upon them without shame and blushing? Cry out then, Ps.
   xxv. 7, Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
   according to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, O
   Lord.' And in thy riper years how shamefully didst thou stray from God,
   even since thou begannest to have more of conscience, and a greater use
   of reason? It were end less to trace us in all our by-paths: Who can
   understand his errors?' Ps. xix. 12. In every age, in every condition,
   in every business, we have been wandering from God.

   3. Since grace received we have had our deviations: Ps. cxix. 176, I
   have gone astray like a lost sheep: seek thy servant, for I do not
   forget thy commandments.' Though our hearts be set to walk with God in
   the main, yet we are ever and anon swerving from the rule, either
   neglecting our duty to God, or transgressing against the holy
   commandment. Oh, therefore eat your passover with sour herbs, and bless
   the Lord for finding you out in your wanderings, and following you with
   the tenders of his grace in Christ.

   Use 2. If the Spirit of God sets forth our natural estate by the
   straying or wandering of sheep, see if this disposition be still in
   you, yea or no. Are you not apt to go astray from God and from his
   ways?

   1. From God. Every sin is a departing from him, but especially
   unbelief: Heb. iii. 12, Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of
   you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.' Adam
   thought to find much happiness in forbidden fruit, to mend and better
   his condition, but was miserably disappointed. So when we do not
   believe God in his word, we will be trying our fortunes and taking our
   own swing and course. But I speak of a more general disposition. There
   are some whose main care it is to be getting away from God; as the
   prodigal went into a far country, Luke xv. 11. They think to be better
   anywhere than at home under God's eye and presence. This appeareth by
   the care they take to keep God out of their thoughts: Ps. x. 4, God is
   not in all his thoughts.' A thought of God rushing into their mind is
   very unwelcome and unpleasant to them; they are backward and hang off
   from communion with God, and the duties of religion are looked upon as
   a melancholy interruption.

   2. From the ways of God. Though they are the only ways of peace and
   life, and will surely make us happy in the end, yet naturally we are of
   a libertine and yokeless spirit. Sinners looking upon all things
   through the spectacles of the flesh, count them harsh and unequal, and
   a strict confinement: Mat. vii. 14, Because strait is the gate, and
   narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find
   it.' They cannot endure God's restraint: Prov. xiv. 12, There is a way
   that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of
   death.' The broad and easy ways of sin are pleasing to flesh and blood,
   but destructive to the soul. Well, then, he that counteth the company
   of God or the ways of God irksome, hath this wandering disposition
   still remaining with him; and if it be not checked it will prove his
   eternal destruction. The sheep do not fare the better for going out of
   the pasture. We leave all good in leaving the chiefest good; and in
   departing from God you turn your back upon your own happiness; as
   beasts put into a good pasture will yet seek out some gap that they may
   range abroad.

   I come now to observe from the distribution of this common error: every
   man to his own way:--

   Doct. 2. That there are many several ways of sinning; or thus, though
   there be one path to heaven, yet there are several ways of sinning and
   going to hell.

   Every man hath his several course. And as the channel is cut, so his
   corrupt nature findeth an issue and passage: Eccles. vii. 29, God hath
   made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions.' One hath
   one invention, and another, wherein he imagineth to find contentment
   and happiness, but findeth none. Man swerving from the state of
   happiness and sufficiency wherein God had created him, thinketh to
   better his condition, and therefore hath many devices and inventions,
   which indeed make it worse. So 1 John ii. 16, For all that is in the
   world is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of
   life.' Though no sin cometh amiss to a carnal heart, yet some are more
   kindly and suitable to that particular humour. One's notorious blemish
   is the lust of the eyes, worldliness; another, sensuality; another,
   pride; one this sin, another that. Hence the psalmist saith, Ps. xviii.
   23, I kept myself from mine iniquity.' That which most urgeth us, and
   prevaileth with us, we should endeavour to mortify.

   The reasons how this cometh to pass are:--

   1. Because of the activeness of man's spirit. It is always a-devising
   wickedness, which as it is true most especially of the malicious musing
   mind, so of all evil hearts: Ps. lxiv. 6, They search out iniquities,
   they accomplish a diligent search; both the inward thought of every one
   of them, and the heart, is deep.' A wicked spirit is a searching
   spirit; they contrive new ways; they are always finding out new
   inventions and devices; they are not contented with the way God hath
   set them, and therefore will try others.

   2. It happeneth through diversity of constitutions. Amores animi
   sequuntur humores corporis--the conditions of the mind follow the
   constitution of the body. The matter of some men's bodies is more
   viciously disposed than others are. We plainly see the body hath some
   indirect operation upon the soul; the affections, in their work and
   exercise, depend upon the body; and these corrupt affections meeting
   with a disposed body for them, by a violent sway carry the whole man
   with them. And this reason is the stronger, because the devil joineth
   with our tempers to help on those sins to which we are naturally
   disposed, as wantonness, drunkenness, gluttony; or if of a better
   constitution, to pride and vainglory. As when the devil observeth a
   lustful man, he helpeth forward the temptation, and offereth occasions,
   stirring up raging and immoderate desires, until at length, forgetting
   all shame and modesty, or the danger of punishments, he does most
   foully pollute himself. So if to luxury and gluttony, he presents sweet
   baits till the soul is drowned and drenched in meats and drinks, and
   there be no sense of piety, and the heart is made unwieldy to prayer or
   any good duty. So for contentious or furious persons; whatever the
   constitution be, he worketh mightily in the children of disobedience.'
   Eph. ii. 2. Godly men find least hurt by him, as being led by the
   Spirit, and avoid the occasions and snares, and strive against evil
   suggestions, and yet they smart too much under his malice many times,
   through the advantage he hath over them by their constitutions.

   3. It happeneth from their business and occasions in the world. Many
   men are engaged to ways of sin because they suit best with their
   employments, the sin of their calling, as vainglory in a minister. The
   apostle saith, Ordain not a novice, lest he be lifted up of pride, and
   fall into the condemnation of the devil,' 1 Tim. iii. 6. So worldliness
   suits a man of business, or deceitfulness in his trade; and corruption
   is common to a magistrate. Several callings and businesses have their
   several corruptions. Men easily slide into the corruptions of their
   way, and every calling, through the wickedness of our hearts, is made
   to serve this or that sin.

   4. Custom and education. Aristotle saith, It is ill education that
   engageth men to a way of wickedness, and it is not easy to break them
   off from it. Vessels will not easily quit their first savour, and
   customs will not easily be left. Teach a child the way of the Lord and
   it will stick by him: Prov. xxii. 6, Train up a child in the way he
   should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.'

   5. Company and example. Men learn from them with whom they converse,
   and thence come national sins, partly as they run in the blood, but
   more by example. Of the Germans we learn drunkenness and gluttony; of
   the French, wantonness. Men shape their practices to the patterns that
   are before them, and learn their way; for it easily taints the spirits.
   And thus you see why there are so many inventions and ways of
   wickedness.

   Use 1. Well, then, do not be too ready to bless yourselves, provided
   the sins of others break not out upon you: do not flatter yourselves
   that you run not into the same sins that others do. The devil may take
   you in another snare that suiteth more with your temper and condition
   of life. Some are sensual and some vainglorious, others worldly; many
   meet in hell that do not go thither the same way. A man may not be as
   other men, and yet he may not be as he should be: Luke xviii. 11, The
   pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee that I
   am not as other men;' yet the publican went down to his house justified
   rather than the proud pharisee.' Those that slighted the invitation to
   the marriage-feast had their several diversions and reasons of excuse:
   Mat. xxii. 5, But they all made light of it, and went their ways, one
   to his farm, another to his merchandise.' One hath business to keep him
   from Christ, and another pleasures and the pomps and vanities of the
   present world, and another has his superstitious observances. But all
   obstruct the power of the truth, and the receiving of Christ into their
   souls. Every man will have his way, saith Luther upon this text. Some
   follow their hawks and hounds, and neglect their precious and immortal
   souls. Others busy themselves in heaping up riches; others are for
   plays and sports to fool away the day of grace. My way,' saith he, when
   I was a monk, was to fast and pray till I had made myself sick; to
   observe the statutes of my order strictly. I called upon the blessed
   Virgin, and St George, and St Christopher'; and this was my way. And so
   vile a creature as I was, for all this, became the more sinful.' Others
   may hate this or that public and visible blemish, but what are thy
   failings? John viii. 7, He that is without sin among you, let him cast
   the first stone at her.' We may rashly censure others, and descant on
   their faults, but it is better to look inward. Do not I offend God as
   much another way as those whom I censure? There is a double
   madness--not only that which is idle and light, and breaketh out in
   strange freaks and furious extravagances, but that which is more sober,
   solemn, and grave. A frenzy betrayeth itself by deep musings and high
   conceits. So it is true of these discoveries of sin. Some delight in
   vain pleasures, others go to hell in a graver course. When a man
   perisheth, he eateth the fruit of his own way, and is filled with his
   own devices,' Prov. i. 31.

   2. Stop your way of sinning, pluck out thy right eye, cut off thy right
   hand, Mat. v. 29, 30. Your trial lieth there, as Abraham was tried in
   offering up his Isaac; and David voucheth it as a mark of sincerity:
   Ps. xviii. 23, I was upright before thee, and kept myself from mine
   iniquity.' It will prove a stumbling-block, and eat out all the heart
   and power of grace if let alone. It concerneth us in our covenanting
   with God to set against the sin of this inbred and natural inclination.
   Though original sin dispose us to all sin, yet our particular and
   personal inclination may carry us more strongly to some one kind of
   sin: Heb. xii. 1, Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth
   so easily beset us.' Thus childhood is wanton, and old age touchy and
   covetous. Sins take the throne by turns, according to our vocation and
   course of life. Every calling hath its temptations, and there is a
   snare which others meet not with. Every condition of life hath a
   predominant sin; as the young man with his great possessions. Oh! let
   us consider our tender parts, our Delilah, our Herodias, that sin that
   hindereth us most in closing with Christ, that sin that most engrosseth
   our thoughts; for they always follow the temper of our hearts. Some
   sins we hide under the tongue, Job xx. 12, which we cannot endure
   should be touched; our private sore is a tender place. Thus Herod would
   not be crossed in his Herodias, and Felix trembled when Paul reasoned
   of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.' Acts xxiv. 25,
   because he lived in intemperance with Drusilla, his pretended wife.
   That which you reserve in turning to God, that which you set up a
   toleration in your hearts for, even this sin must be bewailed to God,
   and you must seek the blood of Christ to mortify it with all the
   promising occasions of it. Act the contrary grace, and see how you can
   deny yourselves in what you most affect.

   Use 2. Is caution not to walk slightly. There is but one right path,
   there are many evil ones. As one said, Evil is manifold, and the way of
   sin divideth itself into divers paths; you may easily mistake. See that
   place, Prov. iv. 26, 27, Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy
   ways be established: turn not to the right hand, nor to the left;
   remove thy foot from evil.' Walk with a great deal of care and
   circumspection. When it is so easy to err, a man would be solicitous.
   The apostle blameth those that did not orthopodein, not walk uprightly
   according to the truth of the gospel.' Gal. ii. 14. They did not go
   with a right foot. The world thinketh strictness to be folly and
   niceness. You see there is a great deal of reason for it: there is
   error on both sides of truth, and you may easily miscarry: there is an
   extreme on both hands. A little to direct you, mind that place, Mat.
   vii. 14, Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, and few there be
   that find it.' There are some way-marks. I think, without wrong to that
   place, that I may give you three--a strait gate, a narrow way, and few
   company.

   1. A strait gate. The entrance into it puts the soul shrewdly to it,
   whether taken for the coming out of ourselves, or the getting into
   -Christ. It is a narrow way to carry the soul right. It is like the pas
   sages by which Jonathan and his armour-bearer sought to get up to the
   Philistines: 1 Sam. xiv. 4, There was a sharp rock on the one side, and
   a sharp rock on the other side; the name of the one was Bozez, and the
   name of the other was Seneh.' So here, between presumption and despair,
   it is hard to keep the soul right, sometimes the wind bloweth in one
   corner, sometimes in another. How to keep our selves from despair in
   going out of ourselves, how to keep ourselves from presumption by
   getting into Christ, is not so easy.

   2. There is a narrow path, tethlimme'ne e odo`s, an afflicted, rough
   way, such as will engage believers--

   [1.] To the exercise of care. A diffident, regardless soul is out of
   his way: you have but a ridge to walk upon: Eph. v. 15, Walk
   circumspectly;' not even as it hitteth; for it is a hard matter to keep
   a good conscience, Acts xxiv. 16; and Prov. xxiii. 19, Hear thou, my
   son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the right way.' You had need
   look to it.

   [2.] To a great deal of pains and sorrow. He was mistaken that said,
   Take thine ease. Many can swallow sins, and pursue them, and yet have
   no sense of them that they are wrong. It is a way that will put you
   upon much sorrow and affliction, because you have such a distempered
   soul, and such a deal of pride and intemperance and anger in it: Rom.
   vii. 24, O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
   of this death?' Ps. cxx. 5, Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I
   dwell in the tents of Kedar!' The saints are apt to grieve that they
   have such a worldly spirit in a heavenly journey.

   [3.] To a great deal of self-denial. It is a way that restraineth
   nature; therefore we are called upon, Mat. iii. 3, Prepare ye the way
   of the Lord, make his paths straight;' Heb. xii. 13, And make straight
   paths to your feet.' There must be strictness in our course. It is not
   such a way as will leave you to the sway of your own hearts. Nature
   would have a thing many times, but you must put a knife to your
   throats, as if you were more ready to slay your appetite than to
   satisfy it. The thoughts, the affections, the speeches, the actions,
   must be reduced to the strict rules of the word. When men please nature
   to the full, it is a sign they have mistaken their way.

   [4.] It will engage you to much mortification, to much opposition: Eph.
   vi. 12, For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
   principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
   this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.' You have
   strong lusts to cope with, and those must be mortified, which you
   cannot do without the Spirit of Christ, Rom. viii. 13. It will cost you
   many prayers and tears, and fighting with spiritual wickednesses.

   3. The next way-mark is, that you have but little company: Narrow is
   the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it.' Many walk
   as others do, and so mistake. Others sever themselves from the world,
   but go in the ordinary track of profession, not out of the common road.
   This is to be true to a sect and company of men, not to the ways of
   God. As Paul, when he was a pharisee, he lived by the eye, and did as
   others did; he lived after the strictest sect of religion y Acts. xxvi.
   5. You must put a difference between the ordinary number of professors
   and yourself. But if you be vain and sensual, what do you more than
   they? Christians should look after the distinction and the difference
   between them and others: Mat. vi. 32, For after all these things do the
   Gentiles seek.' Implying, a man should do more than they, more than the
   men of the world can ever do: Ps. iv. 6, There be many that say, Who
   will show us any good?' That is the fashion of the men of the brutish
   multitude. But the godly say, Lord, lift up the light of thy
   countenance upon us.'

   Use 3. Is to press you to look into the state of your hearts, and see
   what you have by long experience observed, what is your sin, your way
   of wickedness, what assaults you most frequently, most fiercely;
   observe the frequency of temptations, and the strength of them, the law
   in the members, and a thorn in the flesh; so, as it is conceived, he
   calleth the violent stirrings of lusts. Now bend all your strength
   against these; as the king of Aram said, 1 Kings xxii. 31, Fight not
   against small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.' So bend
   the strength of the soul against this way of wickedness.

   I come now to the last point of the first part of the text, and that is
   drawn from that possessive particle whereby every man's by-path is
   expressed: Every man to his way.

   Doct. 3. That this is the sin of men in their natural condition, that
   they turn to their own way.

   The phrase implieth these two things--First, A defect or want of divine
   guidance; Secondly, A rejection of the ways of God when made known to
   us. We do not like them so well as some other, which we fancy to be
   better to us, because more suitable to our carnal desires; and
   therefore it is often charged upon the people of Israel, especially by
   Jeremiah, that they would not regard the ways of God, but the way of
   their own imaginations. See Jer. vii. 24. God had told them that all
   that he required of them was this, Obey my voice, and walk in the way
   that I have commanded you; but they hearkened not, nor inclined their
   ear, but walked in the counsel and in the imagination of their evil
   heart, and went backward and not forward.' So that you see it argueth a
   refusal of God's ways when discovered to them, as not being for their
   turns. So Jer. ix. 13, 14, Because they have forsaken my law which I
   have set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked
   therein, but have walked after the imagination of their heart and after
   Baalim.' They think their own path better, safer, or more comfortable,
   and therefore would not meddle with God's. So Jer. xi. 8, Yet they
   obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the
   imagination of their evil heart.' This refusal is the more sottishly
   perverse; as in Jer. xliv. 17, But will certainly do whatsoever thing
   goeth out of our mouth.' So that here is a scorning to have their ways
   prescribed, out of a presumption that they can better provide for
   themselves. The drunkard, the adulterer, thinks God's way is either
   insipid or injurious. Our first parents thought their conceit was
   better, and that God in envy had denied it to them; and therefore they
   did not weigh God's restraint and prohibition, Gen. iii. 17; she would
   eat, the devil had fastened her fancy to it, and she went on with the
   temptation.

   1. There is a defect or want of divine guidance. God leaveth men to
   their own sway, and taketh away all check and restraint from them; and
   then whatever a man doth is purely from himself. So it is said, Ps.
   lxxxi. 12, I gave them up to their own hearts' lust, and they walked in
   their own counsels.' When all divine guidance or direction is taken
   away, you will be left to the impure dictates of a corrupt mind, or at
   best to some poor remains of civility. As it is said, Gen. xx. 6, I
   also withheld thee from sinning against me, therefore suffered thee not
   to touch her.' Some restraints and chains God casteth upon men, that
   they are not able to do the evil which naturally they would. Though
   they do not go God's way, they cannot go their own. But when God
   pleaseth he letteth men alone, and then they do what is right in their
   own eyes; as you shall see, Acts xiv. 16, Who in times past suffered
   all nations to walk in their own ways;' that is, to live according to
   their own pleasure, prescribing no restraint to them by discovering
   himself in a law; or, to those that have the outward written word, by
   using no inward motions of his Spirit. So that this is the first thing,
   the privative part, a defect of divine guidance, either by such outward
   prescriptions as may revive natural light, or such inward motions as
   may restore it.

   2. That which is positive or more formally imported is a following of
   the dictates of our own corrupt minds, and fulfilling the desires of
   our own corrupt wills. For I conceive this turning to our own way is
   expressed by the apostle upon the same occasion, Eph. ii. 3; for he
   saith there, that natural men have their conversations in the lusts of
   the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.' There
   is a natural inclination to obey his corrupt mind, and to satisfy his
   corrupt will. It is but a pleasing of themselves. It is the way they
   have devised, and the way they have desired. But to speak of these
   things a little severally:--

   [1.] There is a following the dictates of a corrupt mind. This is the
   first and chiefest, and therefore it is often expressed, According to
   their imaginations and their counsels.' There are a great many
   prejudices in a natural understanding against the ways of God. It is a
   way of their own contriving. Men think their way is good: Prov. xiv.
   12, There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof
   are the ways of death.' Their blind hearts dictate to them that their
   own way is the best, safest, most pleasant, and comfortable. The mind
   chooseth, pauseth, and determineth upon what it conceives to be better
   for it than the rule of obedience. Therefore it is called our own way,
   because it is not of God's appointment, but our own choice. Men consult
   with their own hearts, and think sin is better. You may go through all
   the commandments of God, and you shall see a natural understanding
   dictates otherwise than God saith. As to the first table, man hath some
   confused knowledge that there is a God, who is to be worshipped, to be
   spoken of with reverence and observance; that there is some time to be
   set apart for his worship. Now what this God is, what is his worship,
   what time is to be set apart for it, and how it is to be spent, there
   reason faileth. We have some ways that seem right to us for that; and
   we are guided either by our own reason, or prescript of time, or
   education, or example, or custom. It is our own ways that we turn to,
   and therefore do not give God the glory that is due to his name: Rom.
   i. 21, Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
   neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their
   foolish heart was darkened.' They do not glorify him as God. We paint
   out worship by our own lazy thoughts, or overdo it by some fancies of
   our own: this is our own way. Then, as to the second table, there
   natural light is most clear. There we have some sparks and knowledge
   left of good and evil, and yet even there our carnal understanding
   easily leadeth us into a way that we think better to us than that which
   God hath set us; and so we think liberty is better than obedience to
   superiors; revenge is sweet, and injury is looked upon as profitable,
   and mere adultery as pleasant, some thinking nature never planted such
   strong desires in a man but to have them satisfied. And as to theft and
   oppression, why should a man be scrupulous and stand upon conscience
   when he seeth a present benefit? So calumny and reproach of others
   pleaseth us and serveth our ends, by making them odious to others whom
   we ourselves hate. Thus, by a little use, all knowledge of good and
   evil is blotted out of the mind, and a thing seemeth right to us,
   though condemned by God.

   [2.] There is a fulfilling of the desires of our corrupt wills. Men go
   the way of their own affections; and though it be not according to the
   law of God, it is according to their desires, lust being their law; as
   if it were warrant enough to do a thing because they desire it. The
   apostle saith, Titus iii. 3, Serving divers lusts and pleasures;' that
   is, their mind was to obey their vile affections. They think the desire
   was planted in them that they might satisfy it, and they are not bound
   to thwart it: it were a wrong to their natures, whose bent and force
   they follow. It is said of Eve, Gen. iii. 6, that when she saw that the
   tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a
   tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and
   did eat.' Men think there is no harm as long as they do but please
   appetite, and only meddle with what tempts the desire. But, brethren,
   do not deceive yourselves: the mere fulfilling of natural desires
   without thwarting is a walking in your own ways; for even so you may
   wander beyond those bounds by which the word hath hedged up your way,
   be it of pleasures, honour, or profit. One of the first lessons in
   Christ's school is self-denial. You must reckon upon it to go against
   your desires, and indeed it is a hard lesson. The way of natural men is
   their own way, they do not love to be restrained in their desires, and
   therefore they have ventured upon sin, notwithstanding great
   restraints, yea, the more for restraints. Men fancy some exceeding
   goodness in forbidden fruit, and think the prohibition cruel and
   envious, and therefore will venture and try their own way, as being
   loth to lose their longing and to disappoint nature. See that place,
   Rom. vii. 5, For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which
   were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto
   death;' that is, when in our natural condition, the restraints of the
   law revived sin, and we let it work, though it were to our destruction.
   Men's voluptuous hearts will not let them enter upon such a strict
   course as the law prescribes. Well, now, gather all together, and you
   may see what it is to turn to our own way. It is to be left to
   ourselves, and then to reject the ways of God, upon a supposition that
   we have found something that is better for us, because it is more
   pleasing to our fancies, and more suitable to our desires.

   The reasons may be referred to two heads. Our own way can never be
   right, either--

   1. To please God; or,

   2. To do ourselves good.

   1. Not to please God. This appears in that:--

   [1.] God will not stand to our appointment. Nothing pleaseth him but
   what he hath required; all other things he looketh upon as mere
   invention or imagination. Though man should be very zealous in his own
   way, with never so devout an intention, it is not acceptable. There is
   naturally implanted in the creature some desire to please God. Now, you
   will never do it in your duties, or in your lives, if your carriage be
   not suitable to his rule: Micah vi. 7, 8, Will the Lord be pleased with
   thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give
   my first-born for my transgression, and the fruit of my body for the
   sin of my soul?' Here is a very liberal proposal. Bat what doth the
   prophet rejoin upon this? He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and
   what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy,
   and to walk humbly with thy God?' There is the trial what God hath
   required of us. He will not stand to the creatures' courtesy; it is his
   prerogative to appoint what pleaseth him best. God hath been angry with
   things, though done with a good intention, if not according to what he
   hath showed. Uzzah's breach sets forth this: 2 Sam. vi. 7, God smote
   him for his error;' it is said there, for doing besides the rule.' So
   you may see in a case that concerneth conversation as well as worship:
   Rom. x. 2, it is said of the Jews, that they have a zeal of God, but
   not according to knowledge.' They were very furious in it; they had
   good intentions, but they did not understand God's way. A man may seem
   to have much zeal, and much scrupulous tenderness of doing good, and
   avoiding evil; but it is such as is in his own fancy and apprehension,
   but not in God's law; he hateth it. The false teachers had some
   seemingly strict ordinances: Col. ii. 21, 22, Touch not, taste not,
   handle not;' but they were the doctrines and commandments of men. Thus
   you see God will not like our way, though it should be never so strict,
   and accommodated with the advantage of many devout and pure intentions.
   A popish spirit may be very devout, but God regardeth it not, because
   it is not according to his appointment. A good intention cannot make
   the action good, but the conformity of it to the rule; otherwise, those
   that slew the apostles and crucified Christ pleased him; many of them
   did it with a devout heart to that way which seemed right to them and
   they thought was pleasing to God: John xvi. 2, The time cometh, that
   whosoever killeth you, will think that he doeth God service.' They
   think this is well, and will please God. Usually that hath been the lot
   of the saints hitherto, to suffer under such rage as hath been rashly
   and unadvisedly conceived for God's sake. Ecclesia nunquam magis passa
   est quam sub nomine ecclesiae. Therefore I say, God doth not look to
   the intention of a thing, but the conformity of it to the rule, and to
   his appointment, that he liketh; otherwise that which is odious to him
   would seem right in our eyes.

   [2.] Suppose God should commit it to ourselves, yet we should never do
   that which would please him. If God had left us no direction but the
   light of our own reason, we would never reach the right way, but there
   would be divers hindrances; as--

   (1st.) Ignorance. Natural men know not which way to go about it: they
   are described, Rom. i. 21, to be such as became vain in their
   imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.' A frivolous mind
   every man hath; the word is dialogismois, they are vain in their
   discourses and reasonings: they have very unsavoury apprehensions of
   the ways of God. It is spoken of the heathen there. And the like you
   shall see of the Jews, and of natural men within the church: Jer. iv.
   22, For my people is foolish; they have not known me, they are sottish
   children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but
   to do good they have no knowledge.' Men of parts are sometimes
   extremely ignorant in point of duty towards God and man, and therefore
   certainly their own path must needs be a wrong way. Brethren, it
   signifies not what men in a notional way can discourse or argue
   concerning duty, for their foolish darkness will be discovered when it
   cometh to practice.

   (2dly.) Their antipathy against anything that concerneth the ways of
   God. Our way must needs be seen, for our heart is exceeding averse to
   the will of God: Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is enmity against God.'
   Mark, it is not only an enemy, but enmity. There is the spirit of
   malice in it against all the ways of God. Therefore, God's appointments
   and carnal devices will never be brought together; if you be wise to
   the flesh, you cannot be wise to duty. A carnal wise heart must needs
   err in its choice then. There is a disallowing of all that is good, and
   an approving of all that is naught: this is most suit able to us. See
   Isa. v. 20, Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil; that put
   darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet
   and sweet for bitter.' The prophet useth divers expressions to set out
   that wicked disvaluing of the ways of God that is in all carnal hearts.
   They think all the comfort and sweetness is in their own ways of
   jollity and excess, and for God's ways they look upon them as bitter
   and dark, such as will banish mirth and eat out all contentment, and
   fill the heart with sad fears and darkness. Oh, how are these men
   mistaken!

   (3dly.) We have a base, paltry heart, and are loth to serve him as far
   as we know. It is said, Rom. i. 28, They did not like to retain -God in
   their knowledge.' They do not approve or make such precious account of
   the ways of God as they should do. Carnal men are loth to go contrary
   to their desires. They like the knowledge that they have, and are
   better content with ignorance,--as it is said, 2 Peter in. 5: the
   apostle Peter saith, They are willingly ignorant' of what might make
   against them. This they are angry at, that they know so much, and are
   willing to practise so little; and, therefore, what is chosen and
   followed with full consent by such hearts must needs be a wrong way.
   You may well suspect whatever nature deviseth so willingly, and
   practiseth so cheerfully. This is the first reason: Our own way is not
   the right way, because we can never please God in it.

   2. Our own way is not the right way to do ourselves good. The more we
   please the flesh, the more we wrong our own souls: passions and corrupt
   affections do but blind the heart to its own destruction. As the fishes
   that play down the pleasant streams of Jordan devolve themselves into
   the Dead Sea, so ways that are altogether suitable to our nature do but
   end in destruction: Prov. xvi. 25, There is a way that seemeth right
   unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.' Mark, it is the
   plural, ways,--it is multiplex. A man ruineth himself many ways, by one
   sin or another; some their way is adultery, that wasteth the strength,
   blasteth the beauty, bringeth infamy, poverty, reproach, horror of
   conscience, death, and eternal destruction. Another drunkenness, which
   besots the brain, wasteth the estate, betrayeth a man to reproach,
   brawneth the heart, and bringeth death and destruction. I will not
   stand longer upon the reasons, but apply it.

   Use 1. Is caution to you not to go in your own ways, neither in worship
   nor conversation; that is the sin of men in their natural condition.
   Now, that you may not do so--

   1. I shall give you some cautionary propositions.

   2. A few directions.

   The cautionary propositions I shall spread before you for the greater
   quickening and incitement of you.

   [1.] God may not like what men like: Prov. xvi. 2, All the ways of a
   man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weigheth the spirit.' A man
   that doth not weigh his service in the balance of the sanctuary is not
   sensible of the defects of it God weigheth and can look beneath the
   veil of pretences: so Luke xvi. 15, For that which is highly esteemed
   amongst men is abomination in the sight of God.' You may please
   yourselves in your ways, and yet you may very much displease God. The
   rule holdeth in duties. You may pass it off as if it were a seemly
   beast for an offering, whereas God looketh upon it as a poor, sick
   sacrifice, a corrupt thing, Mal. i. 14. This rule likewise holds good
   in conversation. Men please themselves in an easy moral way, but God
   can find a great deal of evil in it. We look upon sins as they are
   odious abroad, but God considereth inward guilt. Now, when men live in
   an easy, voluptuous, sensual way, they do not check themselves for it
   because others do not, but God may hate them for it.

   [2.] Nay, the more thy way pleaseth thee, the more thou shouldest
   suspect it doth not please God. Whence cometh all this vigilance?
   Either the thing is carnal, or, if it be spiritual, thou art set on by
   the concernments of the flesh. Certainly, thy carnal heart is set on by
   something that is suitable. David did not dare touch the waters of
   Bethlehem, because he longed for them: 2 Sam. xxiii. 15, 16, Oh that
   one would give me of the water of Bethlehem!' He would not drink of it,
   because they went in jeopardy of their lives that fetched it, but
   poured it out before the Lord. I say, in doubtful things, when thou art
   so vehement, suspect thy heart; and the more thy life pleaseth thee,
   fear it is the less acceptable to God. Consider not what thou art
   willing to do, but what God alloweth. Nature would not be so strongly
   bent upon a thing, if there were not corruption in it. These are the
   two quickening propositions. The rules or directions are three:--

   [1.] Lead your life by a divine rule; have respect to the commandment.
   See how heartily David prayeth, Ps. cxix. 10, With my whole heart have
   I sought thee; let me not wander from thy commandments.' That is the
   rule--the law a man should go by. Advise with the word. Bind it
   continually about thine heart, and tie it about thy neck.' The
   commandment is a lamp, and the law is light. When thou goest it shall
   lead thee, when thou sleepest it shall keep thee, and when thou wakest
   it shall talk with thee,' Prov. vi. 21-23. He would not deviate into
   his own path: Gal. vi. 16, As many as walk according to this rule,
   peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God;'--they that
   walk by this rule, that is, according to the word of God. The law is
   the expression of God's will to us creatures, therefore conform to
   that. If Christians had oftener recourse to the rule, they would have a
   better sight of duty.

   [2.] Beg divine assistance. We cannot keep to God's rule without God's
   power; beg it of God, then, as David in the psalm before mentioned.
   There are divers places hint this in scripture. It is a sign we run
   beyond ourselves when we would not be directed by God. When God leaveth
   us to ourselves, then we leave his law: Acts xiv. 16, In times past God
   suffered the Gentiles to walk in their own ways.' A man left to himself
   cannot but err; and, therefore, desire God that he would guide you; for
   a blind mind and a wicked heart cannot guide you in his ways. This is
   called a taking heed to the word, Ps. cxix. 9; and ver. 101, I have
   refrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep thy word;' and
   David prayeth, ver. 133, Order my steps in thy word.' God must order
   every step, or else we shall soon go astray.

   [3.] Look up to divine encouragement. As you must take the word for
   your rule, and the Spirit for your guide, so the promises for your
   encouragement: 2 Cor. vii. 1, Having, therefore, these promises, dearly
   beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all. filthiness of the flesh and
   spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God;' 2 Peter i. 4, Whereby
   are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these
   you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
   corruption that is in the world through lust.' Worldly wisdom is seen
   otherwhere: Rom. viii. 5, For they that are after the flesh do mind the
   things of the flesh; and they that are after the Spirit, the things of
   the Spirit.' Christians should fetch in a supply that way; it is a sign
   you are in God's way when you eye God's encouragements. Some mind only
   to compass their carnal ends, and sweeten all their endeavours by
   fleshly considerations; they are in their own way: To be carnally
   minded is death.' To savour only fleshly encouragements argueth a very
   naughty heart.

   Use 2. Is examination, to try whether you be in the state of nature or
   no. Your own way is a sinful way; and, therefore, what is the
   generality of your conversations? Is it not a turning to your own way?
   But, you will say, how shall I know that?

   1. By the suitableness of it to nature. A life led in pleasures,
   without self-denial and mortification, certainly is none of God's way;
   it is a way of your own choosing: 1 Tim. v. 6, She that liveth in
   pleasure is dead while she liveth.' Though she liveth a natural life,
   she dieth a spiritual death. This is even just as nature would have it.
   Observe what compliance it hath with your carnal desires and delights.

   2. By the easiness of it to nature. It is your own way, for you can
   walk in it by your own strength. It is often said of such as were in a
   natural state, He did that which was right in his own eyes.' You have
   shaped out to yourselves such an easy course; but what difficulty is it
   to be such a Christian? Solomon saith, Lean not to thine
   understanding,' Prov. iii. 5, but trust in the Lord with all thine
   heart.' That is necessary to true Christianity; but now here men keep
   up themselves well enough, though no intercourse be between them.

   3. The serviceableness of it to nature, and to natural ends and
   courses. Every man naturally is for himself, to attain honour, plea
   sure, profit, or satisfaction to his lusts. Our own way will serve for
   our own end. Though many things that man may do be of divine
   appointment, yet it is but your own way still; you borrow means of God
   to further your own purposes. The glory of God is the great Christian
   end, but men value themselves by other things.

   Use 3. Is exhortation; to press men in their natural condition to turn
   from their sottishness and foolish ways by repentance. Now repentance
   first beginneth with turning from our own ways, as the prophet Jeremiah
   calleth it: Jer. xxvi. 13, Therefore now amend your ways and your
   doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God.' To this end a few
   things must be spoken to.

   There are two things that make this exhortation fruitless:--

   1. Carnal prejudices. Do not believe what your own hearts suggest to
   you concerning the folly and uncomfortableness of God's ways, for these
   prove the best and most comfortable to the soul. Other pleasures are
   but for a season, Heb. xi. 25. Natural reason calleth sour sweet. The
   best way to know is to try them once, then you will see how all was
   delusive; mistakes and prejudices will vanish then.

   2. Despairing stubbornness. Men have been in an ill way, and they are
   loth to quit it: they think now they must try the worst of it: Jer.
   xviii. 12, And they said there is no hope, but we will walk after our
   devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.'

   But I would not tarry too long on these black lines and dark shadows of
   man's sin and misery which are in the text; therefore I come now to the
   comfortable part, viz., God's remedy: and the Lord hath laid on him the
   iniquities of us all. There I propounded three things:--

   1. The author of our deliverance: the Lord; that is, God the Father.

   2. The nature or manner of our deliverance: he hath laid our iniquities
   on him.

   3. The parties interested: the iniquities of as all.

   1. The author: the Lord.' You may take it essentially for the whole
   Deity, or personally for God the Father, who, in the mystery of
   redemption, is looked upon as pars offensa, the wronged party against
   whom the offence is committed, and the supreme Judge to whom the
   satisfaction is tendered. The point is--

   Doct. That God the Father laid our iniquities on Christ.

   I shall a little open this point to you, and therein you shall see,
   that whatever Christ did as Mediator, or whatever was done to Christ,
   is attributed to God the Father, to his counsel and appointment.

   1. He designed the person, and therefore it is said: Gal. iv. 4, God
   sent forth his Son;' Rom. viii. 3, God sending his Son in the likeness
   of sinful flesh;' 1 John iv. 14, God sent his Son to be the Saviour of
   the world.' It noteth the decree and designation of God the Father
   concerning the second person: John x. 36, Whom the Father hath
   sanctified, and sent into the world.' When a thing or person is set
   aside for divine uses and purposes, it is said to be sanctified. And so
   it is said, John vi. 27, For him hath God the Father sealed.' The
   Father cannot but accept of the obedience of Christ in the name of
   those for whom it is offered, and who do lay hold upon him by faith,
   seeing Christ did not come of himself, but was sent of the Father to
   pay our ransom for us. Moses, that interposed of his own accord, was
   denied: Exod. xxxii. 32, If thou wilt not forgive their sin, blot me
   out of thy book.' But God told him, The soul that sinneth, him will I
   blot out of my book.' But Christ interposed not of his own accord. This
   sending his Son was a remedy of God's appointing. So in the place
   forementioned, John x. 36, Whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent
   into the world;' that is, consecrated him from eternity unto the office
   of Mediator, and then sent him into the world to assume human nature
   into the unity of his own person. Him hath the Father sealed;' that is,
   the Father hath authorised him to be the Saviour and Redeemer of lost
   sinners. He hath a commission under the broad seal of heaven. Thus
   kings give commissions to their ministers of state, who are employed in
   their affairs: Esther viii. 8, For the writing which is written in the
   king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.'
   Christ coming in God's name is fully authorised to do your souls good.

   2. He qualified him for his office, and therefore he is said to be
   anointed with the Spirit of the Lord to preach the gospel to the poor,
   and to heal the broken-hearted.' Luke iv. 18; and John iii. 34, For he
   whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God, for God giveth not the
   Spirit by measure unto him.' As Mediator he is endowed with the Spirit
   for the discharge of his office, that he might be a full storehouse of
   all grace for his people: 1 Cor. i. 30, Who of God is made unto us
   wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.' Surely
   we may use him for what he was made of God.

   3. Whatever was done to Christ as Mediator, was from God the Father;
   either, first, mediately by men; God ordered their cruelty with
   reference to his own designs: Acts iv. 28, For to do whatsoever thy
   hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.' God hath so laid
   the state of our redemption, that whatever was done to Christ, he
   ordereth the whole business from first to last. Or, secondly,
   immediately by God: Isa. liii. 10, It pleased the Lord to bruise him,
   he hath put him to grief;' Zech. xiii. 7, Awake, O sword, against my
   Shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow.' Our sin and
   punishment was not taken up by Christ without the Father's privity and
   consent; it was not by our desire and will, but by the counsel of the
   Father, that he laid our iniquities upon him.

   4. Whatever was done by Christ, you shall find in the scripture; Christ
   always going according to the appointment of the Father, the whole work
   being but a testimony of his obedience: Heb. x. 7, Lo, I come to do thy
   will, O God.' In the whole transaction Christ would be ordered by the
   will of his Father; the Son is become a servant in this business;
   therefore it is said, Phil. ii. 7, He took upon him the form of a
   servant.' So in that place, Heb. x. 5, A body hast thou prepared me.'
   It is in Ps. xl. 6, Mine ears hast thou opened,' or bored; that is,
   made me a wise and faithful servant in the work of redemption. They
   were wont, under the law, to bore the ears of their servants: Exod.
   xxi. 6, So that he was to be a servant for ever.' And thus you have
   Christ always professing his obedience to the Father. As if it were not
   his own business that he was set about, and he could not do as he would
   in it, but he must be acted and guided by another: John x. 37, If I do
   not the works of my Father, believe me not;' John x. 18, I have power
   to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again; this
   commandment have I received of my Father.' All which is a testimony
   that the Father was satisfied by his sufferings, and is a ground of
   strong consolation to believers. The way was agreed upon between God
   and Christ long before the accomplishment. It was not out of impotence,
   as if forced to give place to the devil and the violence of wicked men,
   but obedience to God's designed way.

   Now in two things Christ showeth this:--

   [1.] As if he acted altogether by the Father's power: John v. 19, The
   Son can do nothing of himself.' So ver. 30, I can of mine own self do
   nothing;' that is, the Father and he were distinct persons in
   themselves, but not separate in nature, power, and operation. The Son
   acts by the Father, and the Father in the Son. The Son doth nothing of
   himself, that is, separate from the Father. Or understand it of the
   manhood of Christ, that is guided by God the Father in its operations,
   it doth not act at pleasure. Christ would will or act nothing separate
   from the will and power of the Godhead. This is spoken to remove such a
   gross speculation, as if the union between God and Christ were no other
   than that between a natural father and son.

   [2.] As if he acted by the Father's appointment: for he would do
   nothing, neither lay down his life, nor take it up, unless God the
   Father said Amen to it; as where Christ speaketh of some power he had
   in himself, yet it was a power limited by the Father: John x. 18, No
   man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself: I have power to lay
   it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I
   received from my Father.' Christ would lay down his life for his
   people, and take it up again, and all because of the Father's
   commandment. The words are spoken to exclude any external power or
   violence that could be offered to Christ; none could impose upon him,
   but at the Father's commandment he would lay it down, and take it up
   again. Christ would leave a testimony of his love and obedience: John
   xiv. 31, But that the world may know that I love the Father, as the
   Father gave me commandment, even so I do.' No outward force can impose
   upon him, but the Lord can impose. Jehovah laid on him the iniquities
   of us all.'

   The reasons of the point.

   1. Because none else had any power to lay it on Christ but God alone.
   That God could, it is clear by virtue of that interest he had in him. A
   loving son can deny the father nothing. Now, it being the ordination
   and the will of God, Christ would not gainsay it; and as long as the
   Father's commandment lasted, he would obey; and therefore, when the
   burden of our sins lay sore upon him, to whom doth he address himself
   but to the Father? He laid it on, and he alone could take it off: Mat.
   xxvi. 39, He fell on his face and prayed, O my Father, if it be
   possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, riot as I will, but
   as thou wilt.' Though it were a deadly cup, yet Christ would not have
   it any way to pass from him, unless it were the Father's will. He had
   such an interest in him, that he would stoop to that: no other could
   have gained Christ to such a service but the Father.

   2. Because if God should not lay iniquity upon Christ, it would be to
   no purpose; for to him it belongeth, because against him was the
   offence committed. Ps. li. 4, see what David saith there with eyes
   brimful of tears, Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this
   evil in thy sight.' He had sinned against Bathsheba and against Uriah,
   yet against thee only have I sinned.' His sin was not known to many,
   for the plot was closely carried: 2 Sam. xii. 12, Thou didst it
   secretly,' as the prophet Nathan told him. But how should he do to get
   it expiated by him against whom the offence was chiefly committed, and
   who knew it well enough? Ps. xli. 4, Lord, be merciful unto me, heal my
   soul, for I have sinned against thee.' Against whomsoever else the
   offence be, the chiefest aggravation is that it is against God, and
   therefore he must have all the ordering how the iniquity must be
   forgiven: Isa. xliii. 25, I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
   transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.' God
   would have you to look to him as one that only hath to do about the
   guilt of his people's sin: I, even I, am he.'

   Use. Is to inform us what abundant matter here is for your faith to
   work upon. Jehovah laid the iniquities of us all on him. God, whom you
   most fear, God the Father, he is first in the design, and he layeth the
   command upon the bowels of Christ. Do but lay it abroad in some
   particular considerations before you pass over this circumstance: the
   Lord. Certainly all the triumph of faith cometh from it.

   1. The Lord, to whom belongeth forgiveness. It is not the business of
   others to lay it upon Christ, it is not their right, it is not what
   they say, but what the Father saith; you must look to that. You see
   when Christ prayeth for pardon he addresseth himself to his Father, as
   if it were not in his own single power: Luke xxiii. 34, Father, forgive
   them, for they know not what they do.' The Son prayeth, there is hope:
   Father, forgive them.' If it passeth with God the Father, the matter is
   ended. So 1 John ii. 1, Christ is said to be an advocate with the
   Father.' And so you shall see frequent places, as John xiv. 16, I will
   pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter.' Forgiveness
   and mercy and comfort, they all proceed from the Father. It is true, we
   read Mat. ix. 6, that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive
   sins,' but it is by commission from the Father, and as having the mind
   of the Father in it; as it is said, John v. 22, For the Father judgeth
   no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.' So the immediate
   dispensation of all censures is given to the Son by the Father, whose
   will passeth for a law. God the Father, in all the work of salvation is
   to be considered as a superior wronged. And what an encouragement is it
   to a poor soul, in the matter of its faith, to understand that God has
   laid its iniquities on Christ! Oh, then, as you would magnify the
   sufficiency of the Son's merit, so magnify the largeness of the
   Father's mercy. Look upon Christ as able to save you, and look upon God
   as willing to give Christ to you. Christ hath fully satisfied for
   iniquities; the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all. Tell me
   then, where should the soul stick? Usually it sticketh here: they doubt
   whether Christ be for them or no. No pardon is granted but it first
   passeth the Father. Why? because the Father is first in the design. God
   sent the Son. If men would reason thus out of the scriptures, how might
   they shame their hearts in the sense of their unbelief! Oh, wait then
   for the Spirit to fix this truth upon you. Though a man should frame
   never so many deductions without the Spirit, it would not do.
   Therefore, I cease to wonder why men do not believe, though they can
   object nothing against the free grace of God.

   2. The God whom you have wronged. Sin is against all the persons of the
   Trinity, but it is chiefly against the Father. You may despise the Son,
   and grieve the Spirit, but the chiefest injury is against the Father,
   because he is the fountain of all; nay, all that is done to the other
   persons redounds to the Father's dishonour. Thus our Saviour often
   reasoneth with the Jews, He that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent
   me.' And the injury to the Spirit, it is called a vexing of his Spirit:
   Isa. lxiii. 10, They rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit.' Therefore the
   prophet inquireth, Isa. vii. 13, Is it a small thing for you to weary
   men, but will ye weary my God also?' Oh, what a grievous thing is this,
   to do all this despite to God, that you have vexed and wearied God by
   your stubborn resisting of the motions of his Spirit! Why, yet this God
   puts Christ upon this task, the Lord hath laid on him our iniquities.
   He whom you have most cause to fear is your greatest friend. A soul
   that is sensible of sin is sensible of the wrong he hath done to God.
   Why, though you have wronged him, he is chief in the design of mercy.
   You have not only the Son on your side, but you have the Father.
   Jehovah laid our iniquities upon him. You shall see the apostle maketh
   it a great advantage to mercy that we have the Son and Father too: 2
   John 9, He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the
   Father and the Son.' He hath one that is willing and one that is able
   to save him, and therefore the wronged party is of his side and
   reconciled to him. O Christians! triumph now in this great design of
   salvation, if you believe you have an interest in the Father's
   affection, as well as the Son's merit. Nay, to invite you to believe,
   consider what a remedy here is against all your doubts; it was the Lord
   that put Christ upon all that he did for you. I use the more words that
   I may bring you to weigh these things. Why should you stick at your
   sins? The first motion to pardon cometh from him that should avenge
   them. You have sinned against Jehovah, and Jehovah hath laid on him the
   iniquities of us all.

   3. The Lord, whose will and word is alone to be looked to. It is no
   matter what Satan saith, or what your hearts say, for it goeth
   altogether by what God saith, who hath laid our sins upon Christ. See
   how the apostle rejoiceth that God's hand was in the acquitting of poor
   sinners: Rom. viii. 33, 34, Who shall lay anything to the charge of
   God's elect? It is God that justifieth: who is he that condemneth? It
   is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen.' What a bold challenge
   is there! Satan may say, I can, and our consciences may condemn us too.
   The devil is an accuser of the brethren to God as well as men, and a
   poor soul can go and indict itself at the throne of grace, and bring in
   many a sad charge against itself, and find its own case liable to death
   and damnation. I have sinned, and the wages of sin is death. Ay! but
   who will you believe--God, or Satan and your own hearts? The Lord hath
   laid your sins upon Christ, and you will believe Satan, and lay them
   upon yourselves. God would have Christ not only to suffer the death,
   but to bear the sins; that, as he did take away the condemnation, so he
   might take away the accusation too; for mark, the apostle saith, Who
   shall charge?' and then, Who shall condemn?' Satan hath nothing to do
   to bring in the sad charge, or to collect the doleful inferences.
   Brethren, keep your ground still. It is God that justifieth, the whole
   business of your acquitment is carried on by the Lord. Satan telleth
   you, you have been a swearer, a drunkard. It is a sad thing that you
   have been so, but has God given you a sight of this? Here is your
   comfort, God hath ordered all this to be laid upon the back of Christ.
   Ay! but Satan saith, the soul that sinneth shall die. But keep your
   faith on what God has done; he hath less reason to condemn than he hath
   to accuse. It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen again.'
   Thus you see what comfort there is in God's acquitment. It is the Lord
   hath laid: now, nobody is to be believed before him. It is the great
   policy of Satan to make you put this high affront upon God, that you
   should believe him before the Lord: thus he did by our first parents in
   another case, Gen. iii. 4, Ye shall not surely die.' Here he telleth a
   poor distressed soul, Ye shall surely die. The devil acts his part on
   every hand; but do not you believe him, for it is God that justifieth.
   Satan saith it shall be laid on thyself; the Lord saith, on Christ. Do
   not believe the father of lies before the Father of lights.

   4. The Lord hath laid, even God, that hath so great an interest in
   Christ that he can deny him nothing. Look, as God denieth Christ
   nothing that he asketh him, so Christ denieth God nothing that he
   commandeth him. Thus you shall see when God commandeth Christ to die
   for souls, Ps. xl. 8, I delight to do thy will, O God; yea, thy law is
   within my heart.' It was a gladsome intimation to Christ to be ordained
   to such a service. There is a law upon the bowels of Christ; he is
   called to bear your sins; he will be accounted the sinner, and you
   shall go free. Therefore see what rich matter there is for your faith
   to work upon, and beg the Spirit to fix it upon you.

   Use 2. Is exhortation to glorify God for his goodness. Here are two
   things I would exhort you to:--

   1. To glorify God for his mercy and goodness; and,

   2. To glorify him alone.

   1. Glorify God. Though Christ effected your deliverance, yet he was
   sent by the Father; the Lord laid our iniquities upon him. We have
   experience not only of Christ's love, but of God's; every person of the
   Trinity hath a hand in it, and every person must have his distinct
   glory. I will not speak now of what the Son did, or what the Spirit
   doth, but of the love of the Father. He showed a great deal of love:--

   [1.] In deputing Christ to this office, and laying his command upon
   Christ for it: John xvii. 23, That the world may know that thou hast
   sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.' It is a high
   expression of the love of God to lay our sins upon his own Son, to send
   Christ to die for our sins. It is an expression of the same love to you
   that God bare to Christ; it was the same kind of love, though not the
   same degree, God's complacency in Christ being infinite and
   incomprehensible, above all the creatures in the world.

   [2.] In fitting Christ to bear the sins that were laid upon him. God
   anointed him with a compassionate spirit, so that the Spirit of the
   Godhead was always with him in the greatest agonies, and also in giving
   him readiness and strength. Acts x. 38, it is said, God anointed Jesus
   of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power.' It is usual in
   scripture to express the powerful graces of God's Spirit by anointing.

   [3.] In loving him for it, for taking our sins upon him according to
   his will: John x. 17, Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay
   down my life, that I may take it up again.' Though God's love to Christ
   were eternal, yet you see how he expresseth it, as if he were loved the
   more for his kindness to us. The like expression you have John xv. 10,
   If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I kept
   my Father's, and abide in his love;' that is, his commandments about
   the office of his mediatorship. This is a great endearment to God's
   affection.

   [4.] God rewarded him for it: Heb. ii. 9, But we see Jesus, who was
   made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death,
   crowned with glory and honour;' so Phil. ii. 9, Wherefore God also hath
   highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name.' God
   restored him to his glory with a great deal of renown in the eyes of
   men. So Christ prayeth, John xvii. 5, And now, O Father, glorify thou
   me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the
   world was.'

   2. Glorify God alone. Let not other things share with him in your
   thoughts; do not think it is for your sakes. God can have no higher
   motive than his own will. The Lord laid it upon Christ, but nothing
   moved him to lay it but his own goodness. Now men usually fancy
   something without God to be the ground of his love; but he expressly
   saith, Isa. xliii. 25, I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
   transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. Mark,
   his own sake. Therefore exalt God, in that, as you see, nothing else
   could lay it upon Christ: Isa. ii. 11, The Lord alone shall be exalted
   in that day;' that is, so separately and so singly, that you may see it
   was his own mere will that put him upon such a design of mercy. Dr
   Crisp disputeth at large that nothing else could lay it upon Christ,
   and so excludeth faith and all holy means, out of a mistake that we
   think faith layeth it on Christ, whereas faith only apprehendeth it to
   be laid on Christ. But this we may safely say, Nothing did put God upon
   it that could be found in us, no good disposition, faith or works
   foreseen. It is merely his own sovereignty and goodness; and therefore,
   Rom. iii. 24, we are said to be justified freely by his grace, through
   the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.'

   But a little more particularly let me show you how you do not exalt God
   alone and separately for laying it upon Christ. It is inclusive two
   ways:--

   1. If you have such a secret thought in you that it is because you are
   less sinners than others, therefore you are pardoned, and your sins are
   laid upon Christ.

   2. If because you are greater sinners than others, you therefore
   conclude you shall not be pardoned, you do not give God the glory of
   his prerogative, that he alone should lay your sins upon Christ, but
   you look for somewhat in the creature.

   1. When you think God laid your sins on Christ because you are not so
   vile as others. Take heed, say not in your hearts it is for your
   righteousness. God acts according to his own pleasure; he many times
   leaveth those that to outward appearance are most righteous. You have
   heard of the heathens, and yet they were passed by, as Cato and
   Aristides; nay, Fabricius and Socrates, though they did excel in
   outward honesty of life, yet God did not regard them in his choice.
   Whereas Paul, who was a persecutor, a blasphemer, and injurious, his
   sins were laid upon the back of Christ, as were those of Mary Magdalen,
   and the thief upon the cross, whose whole life was wasted in
   wickedness. And Christ telleth the pharisees that publicans and harlots
   should enter into the kingdom of heaven before them.' It doth not go by
   your works. The apostle Paul doth strive often to remove this conceit
   out of our hearts: Titus iii. 4, 5, But after that the love and
   kindness of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of
   righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved
   us.' All that we could bring to God was disobedience, and lusts, and
   malice, and envy. So 2 Tim. i. 9, He called us with an holy calling,
   not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
   which was given us in Christ before the world began.' God doth not look
   without himself, but only to his own purpose and grace. It is good to
   improve natural light, and to live to the utmost of it; but it is a
   vain thing to think that by any action of ours we should hope to move
   God to lay our sins upon Christ. Luther hath a pretty expression to
   this purpose upon this text: Take heed,' saith he, of bringing the
   servants or the ass to God's mountain. They may accompany you thither:
   Abraham and the lad must go yonder and worship; the servants and the
   ass must tarry at the foot of the hill. Only go you with faith to deal
   with the mercy of God; do not any way admit your works to the glory of
   a pardon.' Therefore, I say, look upon God as laying your sins upon
   Christ, being moved thereunto merely by his own purpose and will. He
   saw nothing in you to incline him to lay your sins on Christ more than
   others'. This is the first way.

   2. When you think God will not lay your sins upon Christ, because you
   are so great sinners, and have committed so much wickedness. We are all
   apt to say, as Peter, Luke v. 8, Lord, depart from me, for I am a
   sinful man.' Do not you make God to eye something without himself now
   to incline him to this? Alas! it is all one to God whether you are
   great or little sinners. The spring and rise of his love in giving
   Christ to you is from his own bowels; and if there be any difference in
   this kind it is in this, that the greater sins comply with God's ends
   and designs. And therefore it is sometimes an argument used to God,
   that though they can bring him no other thing, they can bring him
   wickedness enough. Thus David saith, Pardon my sin, for it is great,'
   Ps. xxv. 11; so Isa. xliii. 24, 25, Thou hast bought me no sweet cane
   with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices,
   but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, and hast wearied me with
   thine iniquities.' What followeth? A man would think terrible,
   thundering words. No; it is a sweet and evangelical promise; I, even I,
   am he that blotteth out your transgressions, for my own sake, and will
   not remember thy sins.' So Gen. viii. 21, I will not again curse the
   ground any more for man's sake, for the imagination of man's heart is
   evil from his youth;' and Isa. lvii. 17, 18, For the iniquity of his
   covetousness, I was wroth, and smote him; I hid me, and was wroth, and
   he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and
   will heal him. I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him, and
   to his mourners.' God, you see, declares that it is according to his
   own purpose, and not of our works. He doth quite contrary to the
   deserts of man, not to debase strictness, but to exalt his own grace.
   Mark, that place fully setteth forth the covenant of grace, Isa. liv.
   9, where God saith, For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; for as I
   have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so
   have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee.'

   I come now to the next part, the nature and way of our deliverance: The
   Lord hath laid upon him the iniquities of us all.' Our sin and
   punishment is transferred to Christ. The point is--

   Doct. That the way that God taketh to acquit poor sinners is to lay the
   guilt and punishment of sin on the back of his own Son. The Lord hath
   laid on him the iniquities of us all.' What the phrase importeth I did
   in part discover in giving you the different readings of it in several
   translations. Four especially you may take to set it off to your
   thoughts.

   1. That of the Septuagint, pare'doken auto`n tais amartiais--he
   delivered him over to our sins. It is hard and sad with a man to be
   delivered over to be torn by wild beasts, to be delivered to
   persecutors, to be burned in the flames, to be stretched on a rack, to
   be broken on a wheel, and other tortures. But it is far more hard and
   evil to be delivered over to sins. Especially for Christ, who was in
   flamed with a desire to please God; there is nothing more abhorrent
   from his nature than the filthiness of sin. And therefore, though you
   should suppose him to be delivered over to the most exquisite
   punishments that the world or the wit and malice of man can invent, yet
   it is nothing in respect of his being given over to sins. So the
   spittings, scourgings, buffeting, his cross, and all, were but as a
   flea-biting in respect of his being given over to our sins. God
   delivered him to Pilate. The Jews could have done nothing if power had
   not been given them from above. But to be delivered over to the power
   of our sins, what a heavy thing was this for Christ! And therefore the
   expression doth in part reach what is meant here by God's laying it
   upon Christ.

   2. That of Junius and others, Fecit ut in eum incurrerent peccata
   nostra. Our sins did rush upon Christ; they would fain destroy him, as
   an enemy pusheth sore to destroy their enemy. We read of a company that
   came out to take Christ with swords and staves, and a soldier that
   fiercely run him through. Ay! but brethren, there is another company
   that came rushing, and would fain destroy him, and that was your and my
   sins. We came forth with swords and lances, and, as it were, run him
   through.

   3. Another version has it, Traduxit in eum, or, as with us, he laid it
   on him.' Do but consider what it is to have sin laid upon any. It is to
   be bound over to death and destruction; it is to put that upon a man
   that will be his certain ruin: 1 Kings xiii. 34, And this thing became
   sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it
   from off the face of the earth.' When sin is laid upon a man, it will
   undo him.

   4. Others take our marginal reading, Occurrere fecit in eum: he made
   our sins to meet in him; that raiseth it a little higher. Though one
   sin be enough to ruin a man, yet all the sins in the world were as it
   were concentred in Christ to overwhelm his soul, and to fill it with a
   great deal of terror; and indeed he stood in much danger of a great
   condemnation unless he could satisfy God's wrath. Thus you see, from
   the several readings, what may be gathered out of this expression. And
   I the rather note it, because the Spirit of God useth a word here that
   hath so many significations. Out of all you may gather a delivery of
   Christ over to that which was most contrary to him, which seized upon
   his soul, and settled there, and brought him to the death of the cross,
   and would not leave him till he had fully expiated and satisfied for
   it, even our sins.

   But I come more particularly to set out the thing that is intended here
   by the Holy Ghost in this expression: but he hath laid on him the
   iniquities of us all.'

   There are two things in it--one implied, which is a taking off sin from
   the creature; and the other more formally expressed, which is a putting
   it upon Christ.

   First, therefore, I shall show you how far it is taken off from the
   creature. But, for the understanding of both, you must know there are
   three things in sin:--

   1. The fault or offence against God.

   2. The guilt or obligation to punishment.

   3. The blot or sinful inclination, or vicious disposition to sin.

   1. I begin with the first. For the offence, it is as if it were never
   committed. The creature, when justified and sanctified, is as free as
   if it had never sinned, which is intimated in divers expressions of
   scripture. I will give you a few places: Jer. l. 20, In those days, and
   in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought
   for, and shall not be found; and the sins of Judah, and there shall be
   none, for I will pardon them whom I reserve;' Isa. xliv. 22, I have
   blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy
   sins.' They are exhaled and dried up by the beams of mercy. And Jer.
   xxxi. 34, I will remember your sins no more.' It is quite gone from the
   creature: Num. xxiii. 21, He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither
   hath he seen perverseness in Israel;' Ps. li. 9, David prayeth, Hide
   thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.' God doth so
   cover the sin as if it were not at all; his carriage to the soul is as
   if there were no sin. As a holy and just God, he cannot behold it with
   approbation; and therefore, as a merciful God, he doth as it were cover
   it from his eyes. Whereas, on the contrary, when God punisheth sin, he
   is said to set iniquity before him: Ps. xc. 8, Thou hast set our
   iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy
   countenance;' Ps. cix. 15, Let them be before the Lord continually.'
   God in love will not take notice of the offence.

   2. He taketh off all guilt and obligation to punishment: Rom. viii. 1,
   There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ.' Nothing is done
   in a vindictive and punitive way, though many things be done in a
   corrective and chastising way. All God's dispensations are as branches
   of the covenant.

   3. For the blot or sinful inclination; that is more and more taken away
   by virtue of Christ taking our sins upon him: 1 Peter ii. 24, Who his
   own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead
   unto sin, should live unto righteousness; by whose stripes we are
   healed.' He took away vicious inclinations, as well as the penal
   obligations.

   Secondly, It is transacted on Christ, or laid upon him. We cannot
   safely say the fault, for that is the guilt that groweth out of the sin
   inherent; but the guilt was laid upon him, such as groweth out of sin
   imputed: therefore he is said to bear the sins of many,' Isa. liii. 12,
   and to bear our sorrows and griefs,' ver. 4.

   1. So much sin was laid upon Christ as obliged him to make satisfaction
   for it to his Father's justice; for having once submitted to the taking
   of it, he could not recede; there was a necessity that he should clear
   himself with his Father: and therefore it is said, Luke xxiv. 26, Ought
   not Christ to have suffered, and then to enter into his glory?'

   2. There was so much sin as put Christ in our stead. Therefore, 2 Cor.
   v. 21, it is said, he was made sin for us.' And in this chapter he is
   said to be numbered among transgressors,' nay, the chief of
   transgressors.

   3. So much sin as made him liable to the infinite wrath of God;
   therefore it is said, Gal. iii. 13, he was made a curse for us.' And in
   the Psalms it is said, The pains of hell gat hold of him;' insomuch
   that he needed justification as well as we: Isa. l. 8, He is near that
   justifieth me, who shall contend with me?' It is spoken of Christ; this
   chapter is a chapter of Christ. He needed that God should clear him.

   4. So much sin as would have sunk him into eternal misery, had he not
   been God to escape out of it: Acts ii. 24, Having loosed the pains of
   death, because it was impossible that he should be holden of it.' And
   therefore you shall find faith's chiefest support cometh from Christ's
   resurrection: Rom. viii. 34, It is Christ that died, yea, rather that
   is risen again.' Mark that, mallon de; faith looketh to that as the
   wonderfullest thing, that, having such a weight of sin upon him, he
   should be able to rise up again. This was a great wonder.

   But I come to the reasons of the point.

   1. Therefore did God lay it upon Christ, because he was the fittest
   person to bear it: he was most able. It best befitted the divine
   justice to choose such a person as might not miscarry in the work and
   transaction, else we could have had no assurance that satisfaction was
   given: Ps. lxxxix. 19, I have laid help upon one that is mighty.' It is
   spoken of David, but chiefly means Christ in it. The help is laid on
   one that is most able to go through with it, and Christ was most
   willing to come to the utmost: Luke xii. 50, I have a baptism to be
   baptized with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!' Christ
   had not room enough, his heart being enlarged with love, till he had
   given testimony of it to the world: Luke xxii. 15, With desire have I
   desired to eat this passover.' Christ knew the date of his days was
   then at an end.

   2. This did suit best with God's design, which was to magnify justice
   and mercy at the same time. The mercy-seat did but cover the tables of
   the law in the ark. The law was satisfied by Christ, and yet God is
   merciful to us. David saith, Ps. ci. 1, I will sing of mercy and
   judgment.' God would have his people triumph in both now.

   Use 1. To press us to bless the Lord for this wonderful deliverance by
   Christ.

   1. That sin is taken off from our shoulders and laid upon Christ. How
   miserable would it have been if every man had borne his own burden!
   Gal. v. 6. How light soever men's sins seem when they are committed,
   yet they will not be found light when they come to reckon with God, for
   then sin to an awakened conscience is one of the heaviest burdens that
   ever was felt. Now Christ hath taken off this burden from us. If God
   had laid sins upon us, as he laid them upon Christ, they would have
   sunk us to hell. The little finger of sin is heavier than the loins of
   any other sorrow. If God give you but a touch of it, or a spark of it
   light into your consciences, you will groan sadly: Ps. xxxviii. 4, Mine
   iniquities are gone over mine head, as an heavy burden they are too
   heavy for me.' When we do but taste of this cup, we cry out presently,
   My heart faileth.' You may know it--

   [1.] By what Christ felt. He lost his actual comforts, felt strange
   agonies, insomuch that he sweat drops of blood. We are of weak spirits,
   and soon dismayed, but his soul was exceeding sorrowful: If this be
   done in the green tree, what shall be done to the dry?' Many times, a
   little before a shower, falls a gloominess and sad blackness: so it was
   in Christ's spirit.

   [2.] The saints, when the little finger of God is upon them, how have
   they roared all the day long 1 Ps. xl. 12, Mine iniquities have taken
   hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the
   hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.' All life and spirit
   is gone when God sets home but one sin upon the conscience. Job saith,
   chap. vi. 4, The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison
   thereof drinks up my spirits.'

   [3.] You may know it by your own experience. When conscience is a
   little opened, what horrors and disquiets are there! Prov. xviii. 14, A
   wounded spirit who can bear?' Then for thousands of rams, and ten
   thousand rivers of oil! Cain crieth out, My iniquity is greater than I
   can bear.'

   [4.] Consider the life to come, and the threatenings of the word
   concerning those that die in their sins: Heb. x. 31, It is a fearful
   thing to fall into the hands of the living God.' Who can conceive what
   it is to remain in chains of darkness? 2 Peter ii. 4. Sins that now lie
   asleep like sleepy lions will be then roused up: Mark ix. 44, Their
   worm never dieth, and their fire is not quenched.' This is the portion
   of them that bear their own burden and their own transgressions.

   2. When you begin to feel the burden of sin, make use of Christ for
   ease; remember this burden is laid upon him: Mat. xi. 28, Come unto me,
   all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' The
   weight lieth upon us, not to press us down to hell and despair, but to
   go to Christ, as they were to do under the law to the sacrifice, Lev.
   i. 4. They were to lay their hand upon the head of the sacrifice--a
   rite expressing that the sacrifice did bear the burden of their sins.
   This they were to do with brokenness of heart, acknowledging their
   offences--acknowledging that they were worthy to die as the beast died
   owning the sacrifice of atonement, Christ Jesus: Ps. li. 17, The
   sacrifices of a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.' So John i.
   29, Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world;'
   Look on him whom they have pierced,' Zech. xii. 10. This was done to
   renew the covenant: Ps. 1. 5, Gather my saints together unto me, those
   that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.' And they were to
   promise to walk with God in all humble obedience.

   Use 2. Is exhortation, to beseech you to believe this truth, that your
   iniquities are cast upon Christ. A man hath no benefit by it till he
   believeth. There is as much need of your believing as of Christ's
   suffering. Believe in the Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the
   world.'

   1. As soon as you feel sin a burden, ease yourselves by considering it
   is laid upon Christ. Free grace, as it doth not exclude the merits of
   Christ, so not the application of faith: Rom. iii. 25, Whom God hath
   set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.' The
   business was transacted between God and Christ before all worlds. Faith
   gets it copied out to the soul. You are weary and heavy laden with sin,
   come then to him, Mat. xi. 28, with a lively faith; not as if by faith
   we did anew lay the burden of sin upon Christ, only then we apprehend
   it to be done for our sakes.

   2. After you have gotten an interest in him by faith, renew the sense
   of your pardon, God seeth as a just God, and so our sins should be
   matter of humiliation to us; but he covereth them as a merciful God,
   and so it is matter of comfort. Sins, they were long since laid upon
   Christ; renew thy pardon again by faith, and strive to get an actual
   sense of it. Remember, Christ's soul was heavy to the death, that thou
   mightest go free.

   But you say, I could take comfort in these things if I knew that my
   sins were laid upon Christ; it is only the sins of the elect are laid
   upon Christ.

   Ans. The text saith, The iniquities of us all.'

   Doct. That Christ is set forth in the gospel, as having all men's sins
   laid upon him. The word carrieth it in such a general way, that none is
   excepted, and there are very many other places to confirm it, where
   Christ is said to reconcile the world: 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in Christ,
   reconciling the world to himself;' and to taste death for every man.'
   Heb. ii. 9; and to die for all,' It is good to mark that: 2 Cor. v. 14,
   If one died for all.' I shall come to the reasons why Christ is
   proposed so generally.

   1. Because all men in some sort have benefit by him. So far Christ
   suffered his Father's wrath that was due to all men's sins, that in a
   large sense they have benefit by him. All the common mercies we enjoy
   we have by virtue of Christ's death. You know how the threatening ran,
   In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die,' Gen. ii. 17; nay, it
   is surely die.' And all mankind might have been lost; but yet you see
   the absolute accomplishment of the sentence, even to wicked men, is
   referred to the day of judgment. The worst, at least, enjoy a reprieve
   by Christ. In this sense it is said, 1 Tim. iv. 10, We trust in the
   living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of them that
   believe.' Such as is spoken of, Ps. xxxvi. 6, O Lord, thou preservest
   man and beast;' by a common salvation and preservation. And the word
   soter, which is usually applied to Christ as Mediator, is used there to
   hint that it cometh by Christ; though it be a common mercy, it is from
   him. Thus it is said, Eph. i. 10, That in the dispensation of the
   fulness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ,
   both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.' Some
   understand it of collecting the scattered parts of the world, and
   renewing the creature, which, had it not been for Christ, would have
   been lost. As an orator collects the heads of a discourse, that nothing
   be lost, and bringeth it into one sum. So the heathens, all their
   mercies come to them swimming in the blood of Christ; so the word,
   ordinances, covenant, and outward graces to the church. Thus he
   suffered for the sins of the whole world, that the whole should enjoy
   these common favours and blessings by him.

   2. Because there is a sufficiency in the merits of Christ for all, so
   that if it had pleased God to give Christ to all mankind, his justice
   had been sufficiently satisfied. For there is no defect in the
   Redeemer, and therefore there are so many general expressions in
   scripture to set out the value of Christ's sacrifice; so that if there
   were ten thousand times more sins committed than there are, here is
   enough to expiate them all, the person that suffered being so eminent,
   and the sufferings so great and infinite. Those that perish do not
   perish out of any defect or insufficiency in the merit of Christ, as if
   enough were not done to save them; but out of their own fault, because
   they did not believe it. Thus it is said, 1 Cor. xv. 22, For as in Adam
   all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive;' that is, as there was a
   sufficiency in Adam, the first common person, to ruin all his
   posterity, so there was a sufficiency in Christ to save all that Adam
   ruined; for it must needs be understood so, for take it literally and
   it is against all common experience. Many know not Christ, many hate
   him and will not come unto him: Ye will not come unto me, that ye may
   have life;' Rom. v. 18, Therefore, as by the offence of one judgment
   came upon all to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the
   free gift came upon all men to justification of life.' The text proveth
   nothing but that there was as much sufficiency in Christ to justify, as
   there was in Adam to condemn. That we may not have too low and
   undervaluing thoughts of Christ's sufferings, the scripture speaks thus
   generally: there is enough for me and thee, and all the world. It is a
   great in jury done to Christ to lessen and extenuate him beneath Adam,
   as if he were not as able to recover as the other to ruin us.

   3. Therefore it is expressed thus generally, that all conditions of men
   might be included. God would not have any enclosure of his mercy within
   the bounds of any nation, persons, and conditions of men, that he might
   take off all outward exceptions, and comprise every believer, of what
   condition and rank soever; and therefore he expresseth himself
   promiscuously to all of every state, every nation, every order. It is
   the nature of man to confine privileges to their own nation and order.
   We would be singular and shine alone, and have none share with us;
   envy, I say, grudgeth at the commonest mercies. We see in common things
   nothing is so welcome to us as that which we enjoy alone. The Romans
   would be the only civil nation, all else were barbarians. The Romish
   clergy would have all learning and knowledge confined within their
   function; and the Jews could not endure to hear of a general salvation
   for other nations. It was the harshest note that could be sounded in
   their ears, that Christ died for all. It is much urged by the apostle,
   because of the rage of the Jews, for the enlargement of the pale of
   God's church. Therefore I conceive the apostle did inculcate, and so
   largely insist upon it, to meet with this perverseness of the Jews, as
   that which they would never hear of. In this sense it is said, Heb. ii.
   9, he tasted death for every man;' and so 1 John ii. 2, And he is the
   propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins
   of the whole world;' that is, not only for us Jews, but for all the
   world, even of all places, orders, and ranks. God would not have the
   creatures envy it to any man, he proposeth it so generally to take away
   that Jewish indignation against the Gentiles. Therefore the apostles do
   so plentifully abound in these expressions.

   4. That no man might accuse God as if he had not made sufficient
   provision for his soul. Men are apt to transfer their guilt; though
   they will not charge Christ with it in a way of faith, they will charge
   God with it in a way of censure; as Prov. xix. 3, The foolishness of
   man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth against the Lord.' It is
   their own folly and unbelief, and we are apt to impute it to God, as if
   he did not intend Christ to us. Now there would be more occasion
   offered, if the Lord should have pointed out by name those to whom he
   intended Christ. God keepeth it secret what he will do with men, that
   he may provoke them to endeavours after duty, leaving themselves to his
   good pleasure. No man can plead now, as an excuse for his negligence,
   that God left him out; it is we leave out ourselves; and therefore the
   proposal and offer of Christ is general. God hath expressed enough of
   his will to show man his duty, though not enough of his will to tell
   man his pleasure and secret intention. Now the will of God concerning
   any particular person is hidden. Men would fain excuse themselves of
   duty by prying into God's secrets. God giveth a check to such curious
   impudence, by making the proposal and offer of Christ general, though
   his intentions to give Christ may be particular; yet we must not meddle
   with that. Foolish curiosity proceeds from an innate desire in the
   creature to charge God with all its miscarriages: Deut. xxix. 29,
   Secret things belong unto the Lord, but those things which are revealed
   belong to us, and our children for ever.' The proposal of Christ in the
   gospel, that is a revealed thing, and it belongeth to the creatures.
   God would have it carried so as rather typing out duty to them than
   revealing his own purposes; he would not give the creature such an
   occasion to murmur.

   5. To denote the multitude that should come into Christ, especially in
   the latter times; they are as good as a whole world: he so loved the
   world,' John iii. 16. It is understood by many of mundus credentium;
   they were but a world when Christ saved them. God's elect, compared
   with the wicked world, are but a little flock by themselves, but they
   are accounted in the scripture as innumerable: Rev. vii. 9, I beheld,
   and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations,
   and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and
   before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.'
   Mark, it is a multitude which none can number; the sheep of Christ's
   flock are so many that it is innumerable: in a sort especially, there
   shall be a great increase in the last times. And thus you may expound
   that place: Heb. ii. 9, He tasted death for every man.' In the next
   verse it is so intended, in bringing many sons unto glory.' So Ps. ii.
   8, Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for an inheritance, and
   the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.' The gospel shall
   then be spread far and near. God hath given Christ to have and to hold
   all the world: Heb. i. 3, Whom he hath appointed heir of all things.'
   And it is said in the 10th verse of this Isa. liii., that the pleasure
   of the Lord shall prosper in his hands.' Therefore the scripture
   speaketh this generally, to comprise the vast multitude that should
   embrace the doctrine of Christ.

   6. To denote the oneness, or the one way by which all are reconciled to
   God: all that have it have it by Christ. I say, many times the
   expressions are general, to show that God disposeth of the sins of all
   his people one way. Such expressions are rather exclusive of other
   ways, than inclusive and comprising all persons. God is said to lay the
   iniquities of us all upon Christ, because all those whose iniquities
   are disposed in a merciful way, they are disposed this way. Let me
   exemplify this a little:--The philosophers define good thus: kalo`n
   Estin de pantes ephiletai [9] --good is that which all things desire.
   It is not to be understood as if all things in the world did desire
   good; for stones and timber, and many other things, have no appetite.
   The meaning is, all things that desire, desire that which is good. But
   I will give you instances in scripture: Col. i. 20, And having made
   peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things
   unto himself.' Not that everything is reconciled, but everything that
   is reconciled, is reconciled this way, by the blood of Christ's cross.
   So Titus ii. 11, The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
   to all men;' that is, to all to whom salvation is brought, it is
   brought by the grace of God; it rather noteth Christ's merits than the
   persons that enjoy it. Divers such expressions there are in scripture.
   Thus, John i. 9, That was the true light which lighteth every man that
   cometh into the world.' Not that every man that cometh into the world
   is enlightened, there are many that perish and die in their ignorance:
   the meaning is, every man that is enlightened, is enlightened by him.
   As, for example, such a man cured all the city; not that every
   particular man was cured, but all that were cured were cured by him: so
   Christ is the Saviour of all men, that is, of all that are saved. These
   expressions are exclusive of all other ways, not inclusive of every
   person. Thus you have the reasons.

APPLICATION.

   Use 1. This serveth to clear to us the mistake of the doctrine of
   universal grace, and to explain those expressions in scripture that are
   brought to favour this opinion: though you cannot conclude out of them
   universal grace, yet you may a universal necessity of believing this
   benefit. Solomon saith, Prov. xxiv. 26, Every man shall kiss his lips
   that giveth a right answer;' that is, ingenuous men will mightily prize
   and be taken with aright answer. Why, here now you have an answer
   against the patrons of universal grace. You see the reasons why the
   proposals of Christ are so general, and why there are so many
   expressions of it to all men: it is because all enjoy benefit by him.
   He is sufficient for all: God would not have any enclosure of his grace
   to any particular person; and it is to show the multitude of believers;
   and that God would have all men look to this, and to no other name, and
   to but one Christ.

   Use 2. Is to inform us what little reason we have to refuse to come to
   God at his call, seeing he keeps open-house for all comers; yea, though
   you have no money for heaven: Isa. lv. 1, Ho, every one that thirsteth,
   come to the waters, and he that hath no money: come ye, buy and eat;
   yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and with out price.' The
   publication of the gospel is general to all men to all kinds of
   men:--nothing hindereth now but unbelief, or the refusal of Christ.

   1. Not thy nation. Oh, how are we to praise God that he hath enlarged
   the bounds of mercy to us Gentiles now, as well as to the Jews
   formerly! You may look upon your iniquities as laid upon Christ: Rom.
   xv. 11, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles.' It is quoted out of Ps.
   cxvii. 1. All nations now share in this privilege. You know, in traffic
   or otherwise, peculiar nations have peculiar privileges, but here all
   alike.

   2. Not thy condition. Art thou poor? Christ is as mindful of thee as of
   the rich. God taketh a great deal of care and knowledge of a poor soul.
   In the parable of Dives and Lazarus, the poor man hath a proper name,
   and the rich man hath an appellative; and it is a great favour, I can
   tell you, to be known to God by name. It is spoken as a great privilege
   that God knew Moses by name: Exod. xxxiii. 12, I have known thee by
   name, and thou hast found favour in my sight;' Acts xvii. 34, Howbeit,
   certain men clave unto him, and believed, among which was Dionysius the
   Areopagite, and a woman named Damans.' God took notice of the poor
   woman at Athens as well as the great scholars. So James ii. 5, Hath not
   God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith?' Art thou a poor,
   neglected man or woman, or a poor servant? Yet your souls may be as
   dear to him as the richest man's alive, and he is as tender over you.
   You read in the 16th verse of Philemon, that Onesimus, a servant, was
   above a servant in regard of his spiritual condition. Oh, brethren, it
   is a great fault in men, they do not look after the poor in the world,
   especially poor servants; if they mind the good of the higher servants,
   yet they neglect the other. I speak a homely word, and yet a true one;
   it may be the soul of the poor scullion-boy in the kitchen may be as
   dear and precious to Christ as yours. So it may be said of one
   deformed: Acts xiii. I and Simon that was called Niger' was a saint as
   well as Moses the fair.

   3. Not your sins. Make no exceptions where the word maketh none. Christ
   came to die for the dissolute drunkard as well as for the devout
   hypocrite. Men in despair look upon their sins as Cain did, and cry
   out, My sins are greater than I can bear.' Why, did Christ upon the
   cross only except thy sins, thinkest thou? Did he say he would not die
   for such a one as thou art? Mat. xi. 28, Come unto me, all ye that are
   weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Those that have
   committed so many sins that they are even sunk down to hell by them,
   Christ calleth to himself; yea, the more unlikely it seemeth to you,
   God may have the greater regard to you: Luke xiv. 21, The master of the
   house being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets
   and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed,
   and the halt, and the blind.' A man would have thought a morsel at the
   door had been great preferment for them, and of all persons they should
   never have been invited. There is nothing exempted out of the call of
   the gospel but the sin against the Holy Ghost, and that is never
   pardoned, because the forgiveness thereof is never asked. Take heed of
   making exceptions where God hath made none; a feast may be intended for
   thee, though thou hast a poor, blind, lame soul.

   4. Not any thoughts that Christ was never intended for us. How do you
   know that? Reprobation is God's sealed book. It is not for creatures to
   look into it; you would fain justify your unbelief by God's decree
   against you, but it argueth an ill spirit. If you can exempt yourself
   out of the number of them that go astray, you may exempt yourself out
   of the number of those whose iniquities are laid upon Christ. Let God
   alone with his secret judgments. Christians are to look to the revealed
   will of God--to directions in the scriptures, not to the secret that is
   in God's bosom.

   But still the soul replieth, If I knew that I belonged to the election
   of grace, then I would believe; otherwise, I know that I cannot change
   his purpose by any faith of mine. Doth God promiscuously intend Christ
   to every one? I reserved the discussion of this doubt, that I might
   answer it the more fully. I shall endeavour it in these propositions,
   by which I shall lay open the whole matter:--

   1. Certain it is that there is enough in Christ's death to merit pardon
   for all men in the world, though there were ten thousand times more men
   than ever there were or shall be; and so they would find it if they did
   believe. It is good to determine that first, for the defect is not on
   Christ's part; but this I spoke to before in the reasons.

   2. Though Christ's death be sufficient for all, yet the efficacy and
   benefit of it is intended only to believers--to those that enjoy it by
   faith,--not only applied, but intended only. Mark, I say, that not only
   the efficacy of it is to believers, but the efficacy of it is intended
   to believers. See some proof of this from scripture: John x. 15, I lay
   down my life for the sheep.' There was the intent of God and Christ,
   that Christ should die only for those of his own flock; and therefore
   many times, where you find the expressions of God's love very general,
   you shall see the intention of it is restrained to those that believe.
   As John iii. 16, God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life.' God intended him to the world of believers: whoever
   amongst them do believe, let him be whatever he will, or whatever he
   was, he should not perish. So Rom. iii. 22, Even the righteousness of
   God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that
   believe, for there is no difference.' Though it be to all, it is with
   this restraint and limitation, to all that believe.' And there is good
   reason for it; for if God intended it, he would effect it: Ps. cxv. 3,
   Our God is in heaven, and doth whatsoever he will.' If ever God willed
   it, certainly he would accomplish it--man cannot frustrate it. And if
   God intended the giving Christ to the whole world, Christ would have
   prayed for it. A man can not know what was God's will or the Son's duty
   better than by taking notice of his solemn prayer when he was about to
   offer up the sacrifice of himself: John xvii. 9, I pray not for the
   world, but for them which thou hast given me out of the world.' Christ
   was given for none but for those that were given to him; and for them
   he prayeth, ver. 20, Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also
   which shall believe on me through their word.' Christ prayed only for
   those for whom he died, and he died only for believers.

   3. God no doubt intended him such a sufficient sacrifice to the world.
   Christ did nothing but by the Father's will, as was largely confirmed
   in the beginning of this discourse: John v. 30, I seek not mine own
   will, but the will of the Father, which hath sent me.' It was the
   Father's intention as well as the Son's. So far, then, we may safely
   say, God intended Christ as a sufficient sacrifice.

   4. Though the efficacy and benefit be certainly intended to believers,
   yet God's offer of Christ, and the publication of the gospel, is
   general: Isa. lv. 1, Ho, every one that thirsteth, come to the waters;'
   Rev. xxii. 17, Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life
   freely.' Such commands being rather an intimation of what he would have
   us do than what he intendeth we shall do; of the creature's duty rather
   than of God's will. It is the will of God's pleasure that they ought to
   seek after an interest in Christ. So it is said, I Tim. ii. 4, God will
   have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth;'
   voluntate praecepti, by the will of his command: and by virtue of this
   we are bidden to preach the gospel to every creature, Mark xvi. 16. To
   the making it effectual, there is required not only God's will, but
   God's grace, still reserving to God the power of his own secret
   judgment.

   5. God is serious and in earnest in these offers and publications of
   Christ to all. That he mocketh no man you shall see: do but try him,
   accept him, and he will be as good as his word. It is not made to you
   fraudulently, and with an intent to deceive, but God is serious. God is
   bound to no man, and wicked men refuse him out of their own
   perverseness. And indeed we should rather admire his mercy that he
   giveth Christ to any, than quarrel at his justice that he doth not give
   him to all.

   That God is serious and in good earnest in these offers, appeareth--

   1. By his entreaties. He beseecheth you to take him as well as offereth
   him: Ezek. xxxiii. 11, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no
   pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his
   way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will you
   die, O house of Israel?' 2 Cor. v. 20, Now then we are ambassadors for
   Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.' So God useth all these
   entreaties to show that he is sincere and in earnest with all men.

   2. Because it suiteth more with his delight that you should take hold
   of these offers and not refuse them. God bindeth himself with a strong
   oath: Ezek. xxxiii. 11, As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure
   in the death of the wicked.' Merely as it is the destruction of the
   creature, so God doth not any way approve of it, though, as a just
   punishment, he delighteth in it. If you look to God's approbation or
   delight, your accepting grace more suiteth with it than your refusal.

   3. Because he is angry that you do refuse: John v. 40, Ye will not come
   to me that you may have life.' He is grieved that men, through their
   own folly, neglect that which should do them good: Mat. xxiii. 37, O
   Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them
   that are sent unto thee! how often would I have gathered thy children
   together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye
   would not?' He meant by his outward ministry, though not inward call.
   He was mighty solicitous and earnest in that. So though God use all the
   means with us, and give us all the light that possibly can be into his
   will, except saving light, we turn unto our own way.

THE SEVENTH VERSE.

   He was oppressed, and he was afflicted; yet he opened not his mouth: he
   is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her
   shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.

   THE main drift of the prophet in this chapter, as I have showed, is to
   remove the stone of stumbling and the rock of offence which lay in the
   way of the Jews because of Christ's meanness and sufferings. They
   looked for a Messiah to come fluttering with the pomp and royalty of an
   earthly prince; and therefore, when they found nothing but a mean
   outside, a despised branch, and a withered root in a dry ground, a man
   of no splendour, but of much sorrow, they did easily dash the foot of
   their faith, and split all their hopes upon this rock, as if there were
   nothing worthy of the arm of God to be found in Jesus. Against this
   scandal the prophet maketh many defences, and showeth the several
   reasons why the excellency of Christ was to be hid under the veil of
   meanness and miseries; and therefore what a slender ground there was
   why it should be turned to the blemish and disrepute of Christ.

   1. His first argument was, because it was for our good, and for our
   sakes that he did put on this disguise; and so being found in
   appearance like us, he might be taken in our stead: Surely he hath
   borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.' And what foul ingratitude
   were this, not to know a friend because he hath put on a disguise of
   meanness and misery for our sakes! Having fully traversed this argument
   in the fourth, fifth, and sixth verses, he proceeds to another, a
   second defence against the scandal, and that is--

   2. The voluntariness and willingness of Christ to undergo these
   sufferings. He was not compelled to it unless by his own spirit. He
   might have come in the lustre and glory of the Godhead. Or if not so,
   yet being a man, he might have hid himself secretly from the malice of
   his adversaries; or, when seized upon and taken, he might then have
   vouched his innocency, and have pleaded the matter with them; or have
   made a party among the people, and so, one way or another, rescued
   himself from the ignominy and bitterness of that death that he was to
   suffer. No, saith the prophet, here is nothing but patience and a
   willing subjection to his Father's design: He was oppressed, and he was
   afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth.' And, indeed, you had need
   observe these words, for they were the occasion of the eunuch's
   conversion; for he was reading this very place in Isaiah: Acts viii.
   32, And the place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led
   as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb before the shearer, so
   opened he not his mouth.' And God sent Philip to join with him. And
   usually such scriptures have been of greatest account that have proved
   effectual to the converting of a sinner; as that place in Rom. xiii.
   11, And that knowing the time, that it is high time to awake out of
   sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.' This
   scripture was the occasion of Austin's conversion, as John I. was of
   Junius's conversion, and this of the eunuch's. God sendeth the same
   Spirit to speak to you as to Philip, and you are to hear with the same
   affection. These words are the second argument to take off the scandal
   of Christ's death and bitter sufferings. And it is taken from the
   willingness and ready patience wherewith he underwent those sufferings.
   I may observe in the verse two parts:--

   1. The nature of the sufferings: he was oppressed, and he was
   afflicted.

   2. The carriage of Christ under them: he opened not his mouth; which is
   amplified and illustrated by two similitudes, of a lamb going to the
   slaughter, and a sheep before her shearers.

   The points hence may be many; but because the prophet doth so often
   double and redouble expressions about the sufferings of Christ, and I
   have spoken so much of almost every circumstance considerable in them
   already, I shall be enforced now and hereafter to touch only upon the
   main thing held forth in every verse. Notwithstanding, I shall
   endeavour to draw out the strength and sweetness of every phrase in the
   comment and explication. Briefly, then, to go over the parts.

   1. As to what was done to Christ, or the nature of his sufferings: He
   was oppressed, and he was afflicted.' There is a great deal of variety
   about the rendering of these words, because of the diversity of the
   Hebrew pointings. The vulgar readeth, Oblatus quia ipse voluit--he was
   offered because he would. Symmachus renders it, He was brought, and he
   obeyed. But these do not follow the best pointed Bibles, though they do
   not much vary from the sense intended in the verse. Those come nearer
   that render, He was punished and troubled; for the first word
   signifieth, to exact a thing with rigour and molestation, and is
   applied to this case: as if a man should come and molest a surety for
   the debt of another for whom he is engaged. I find most of the best
   interpreters going this way; and Junius rendereth it, exigitur poena,
   our punishment is exacted of Christ: the creditor came upon him for our
   debt; as if the word did point to that great truth which is held forth
   in other places, that Christ died for us as our surety. And therefore
   he is called the surety of a better testament.' Heb. vii. 22. Mat. xx.
   28, he is said to give his life, lu'tron anti` pollon, as a ransom for
   many.' He laid down his life to set us free from the debt and
   engagement; so that they that are Christ's need not fear that the debt
   will be required of them again: Luke xii. 58, Lest the judge deliver
   thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison, where thou
   shalt remain till the uttermost price be paid.' I say this is a very
   comfortable truth for God's people, that the surety had paid the debt
   for them, so that they need not fear the officer or the prison; God
   hath exacted it of Christ. Or you may, if you will, read, as generally
   our translation, He was oppressed,' as the Seventy render both words by
   one, he was evilly dealt with and evilly entreated: and so our
   translation maketh it to be read with an emphasis, He was oppressed and
   afflicted;' that is, it was such an affliction as did amount to an
   oppression, and yet he bore it patiently. Oppression,' saith Solomon,
   maketh a wise man mad.' Eccles. vii. 7. A wise man, that is a man that
   hath the greatest command over himself. The heart stormeth and rageth
   when it meets with such usage as it did not expect, or hath not
   deserved. But Christ was oppressed and afflicted, and he opened riot
   his mouth. And indeed the sufferings of Christ, in reference to man, do
   best of all come under the notion of oppression; for the other word
   afflicted,' it is well rendered, and therefore I will not criticise
   upon it.

   2. How Christ bore it, or his carriage under it. It is given first in
   general: He opened not his mouth;' and then it is particularly
   amplified by two similitudes.

   First, In the general: He opened not his mouth.' This shows two
   things:--

   1. The great patience of Christ. When all this was upon him, not an
   impatient word dropped from him, either against God or his enemies.
   And, indeed, you shall find in scripture that holy patience is many
   times expressed by holding our peace. Discontent easily breaketh out
   into daring and provoking language. The tongue and lips speak
   unadvisedly against God, therefore the bridling the tongue is a great
   sign of patience. Hence it is said, Lev. x. 3, that Aaron held his
   peace when a remarkable judgment was upon him. Stormy hearts will soon
   boil over; but Aaron held his peace. I conceive it was not out of the
   greatness of his sorrow--as, indeed, griefs are not always
   utterable--but out of the greatness of his patience. As David, Ps.
   xxxix. 9, I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.'
   He sweetly acquiesced in Providence. And so in the person of Christ,
   Ps. xxxviii. 13, he saith, I as a deaf man heard not, and I was as a
   dumb man that openeth not his mouth;' as if he had been either deaf or
   dumb, not sensible of the injury, nor willing to speak of it. Thus
   Christ suffered unjustly for our sake and in our stead, yet spoke not a
   word. This showed his great patience.

   2. His great love to man, showed in his wonderful silence, even then
   when he might justly have spoken in his own defence, but would not seem
   to interrupt the design of God. It is witnessed in many places that
   Jesus held his peace when they asked him questions about his innocence,
   as I shall show you by and by out of several places. I conceive it
   hinteth that great silence that Christ manifested upon all his
   accusations.

   But some may object, and say, How can this be, since Christ did
   sometimes open his mouth? Did not he say to the soldiers, Are you come
   out against me as against a thief and a robber?' And he said to Pilate,
   Thou hast no power unless it be given from above.' And he prayed for
   them, Luke xxiii. 34, and rebuked him that smote with the sword, and
   forbade Peter to use it. How, then, doth this suit with these words, He
   opened not his mouth'?

   I answer--He never spoke to hinder our redemption, neither railingly
   nor revilingly; for so Peter explaineth it, I Peter ii. 23, Who, when
   he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not,
   but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.' He used no
   threatening, no reviling--no, many times not a modest reply, when a man
   would think he might very well have made it. Thus you see the meaning
   of the phrase, He opened not his mouth.'

   Secondly, Now for the particular resemblance; as--

   1. That he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter. The scripture often
   useth this similitude; for, indeed, it was not a casual similitude, but
   a standing type of Christ; as the lamb in the daily sacrifice, Exod.
   xxix. 38, which was offered to God daily, morning and evening, for
   pardon--we being only accepted through his mediation; and the Paschal
   lamb in the Lord's Supper importeth Christ's being offered to God, for
   Christ is called a lamb in scripture, I conceive, for three reasons.

   [1.] As it is an emblem of innocence, meekness, and patience, as the
   lamb was to be without spot and blemish. Therefore, St Peter saith, 1
   Peter i. 18, We are redeemed by the blood of Christ, as of a lamb
   without spot and blemish.' A pure, harmless, undefiled lamb.

   [2.] As it may import weakness and slenderness of appearance in the
   world. Christ is nothing in show, though mighty in power: Rev. vi. 15,
   16, And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
   and the chief captains, and the mighty men, hid themselves in dens, and
   rocks, and mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us,
   and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from
   the wrath of the Lamb,' that is, even from Christ. Christ in his
   weakest appearance was but as a lamb, yet such a lamb as at the last
   day will make the wolves to shake.

   [3.] It noteth the meekness and sweetness of Christ, willingly yielding
   to be a sacrifice for us. Christ, when he cometh to judgment, is
   expressed in Hosea and other places to be as a lion; but when to save,
   then as a lamb. When he cometh to destroy men, he cometh as a lion; but
   when he cometh to destroy sins, he cometh as a lamb. Thus here, and
   John i. 29, Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the
   world.' This was the Lamb the prophet Isaiah foretold, and the
   sacrifices prefigured that Lamb, the Lamb slain from the foundation of
   the world,' Rev. xiii. 8. Well, then, you see the force of the
   expression here,--that Christ went as sweetly and readily to the work
   of our redemption as an innocent lamb to the slaughter or shambles.

   2. The next similitude is, As a sheep before her shearers is dumb.' Of
   all creatures the sheep is the most silent. Hogs whine and hout, but
   sheep are dumb before the shearer. Christ did not open his mouth,
   unless to pray, instruct, and reprove, as before mentioned. Many points
   might be observed, but I will sum up all in this one.

   Doct. That Jesus Christ underwent cruel and bitter sufferings for us
   with' a great deal of willing patience.

   For this I take to be the intent of this verse, to show how ready
   Christ was to accomplish the office of the mediatorship: Rev. i. 5, he
   loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.' For in all his
   conflicts with malicious accusations and opprobrious speeches, he would
   do no violence, nor express anything that might be an occasion to
   divert him from his purpose; but, as a lamb is brought to the
   slaughter, so he opened not his mouth. I shall prove the point:--

   1. By some scriptures that assert it, and show the willingness of
   Christ: Phil. ii. 8, He humbled himself, and became obedient to death,
   even the death of the cross.' With a great deal of willing patience he
   complied with the sorest and most bruising act of the mediatorship. He
   was obedient to death, even the death of the cross.' So it is said,
   Eph. v. 25, Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it.' And in
   other places: Heb. x. 7, with its parallel, Ps. xl. 7, In the volume of
   thy book it is written of me, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.' Christ
   doth, as it were, exult in the command, and rejoice over the work of
   redemption: Lo, I come to do thy will!'

   2. By several passages in the history of Christ's life.

   [1.] His longing for it before it came. When a man desireth a thing, he
   is impatient till he obtain his desire; every minute is tedious till he
   doth enjoy it: Luke xii. 50, I have a baptism to be baptized with, and
   how am I straitened till it be accomplished!' That baptism was the
   laver of his own blood. Earnestness of expectation straiteneth joy, and
   a man cannot let out his spirit upon other things till he hath what he
   waiteth for. How am I straitened!' saith Christ. He consulted with
   himself, that thou, and I, and others, have souls to be saved, and
   therefore he would not do otherwise: Luke xx. 15, With desire have I
   desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.' The earnest and
   vigorous bent of his desire is shown in that expression, With desire
   have I desired.'

   [2.] In not preventing it when he knew it. Many are cast unawares upon
   danger, but Christ knew it, and foretold it before he came to suffer:
   Luke xviii. 32, Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are
   written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be
   accomplished: that he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be
   mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on.' He knew which way
   the divine decrees and predictions ran, yet he went to Jerusalem. He
   could have kept himself safe from danger, yet he offered himself to it.
   It was in his power to have commanded twelve legions of angels, but the
   scripture saith it must be so. He could have kept himself and his
   disciples safe too, for he had power enough: John x. 17, 18, I lay down
   my life, no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself: I have
   power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.' Unless he had
   been pleased to lay it down, no man could have taken it from him.
   Voluntarily he submitted to it. Creatures do things out of necessity,
   because they cannot do otherwise, but Christ might have prevented it,
   for he knew it before: John xviii. 4, Therefore Jesus, knowing all
   things that should come upon him, went forth and saith unto them, Whom
   seek ye?'

   [3.] His cheerful casting himself upon it: John xiv. 31, Arise, let us
   go hence,' Presently, upon the end of that sermon, Christ went into the
   garden, where he is taken. So he saith to Judas, John xiii. 27, What
   thou doest do quickly.' Not to encourage him to the evil in his
   treasonable fact, but to show how willing he was to undertake our
   redemption.

   [4.] In submitting to his Father's will in his highest agonies and
   conflicts: Luke xxii., Not my will, but thine be done.' Here was no
   murmuring, but a sweet submission and acquiescence at the appointment
   of God. Many may seem to submit to God till they come to be pinched
   with the soreness of the trial. It is then you may discern and try your
   readiness in submitting to God's will.

   [5.] By his silence. When he heard the false witnesses, he held his
   peace and answered nothing, Mark xiv. 61; so Mat xxvii. 13, Then saith
   Pilate unto him, hearest thou how many things they witness against
   thee? and he answered him never a word;' so Mark xv. 5, But Jesus yet
   answered nothing, so that Pilate marvelled: and he questioned him in
   many words, but he answered him nothing.' Christ holdeth his peace,
   that we might speak and have boldness with the Father, and taketh the
   accusation patiently, that he might break it off from us. His not
   answering was to show our guilt; and yet he carried it so that nothing
   could be clearly proved to impeach his own innocency: Mat. xxvi. 62,
   63, And Jesus held his peace, and the high priest arose and said unto
   him, Answerest thou nothing?' Not as if his silence did (as it doth in
   others) come from suppressed anger, or scornful stubbornness, but
   patience and meekness: He opened not his mouth.' Not a malicious taunt,
   or proud reproach, nor angry threatenings; nothing but silence, nothing
   but what argued oppressed innocence.

   [6.] By forbidding all violence that might seem to hinder this
   intention: Mat. xxvi. 52, Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy
   sword into its place.' If he opened his mouth, it was to forbid
   violence, and to pray for his persecutors: Luke xxii. 51, And he
   touched his ear, and healed him.' Every one of these things showeth a
   sweet submission, and readiness, and willingness in Christ to suffer
   for us.

   Now the reasons why it must be so are these:--

   1. That he might be fit for the Mediatorship, that all things might
   come freely and sweetly to you from his Father. He offered himself
   willingly, that thou mayest have mercies willingly. All wicked men's
   blessings seem to be extorted from Providence; they have them, as it
   were, invito Deo: Hosea xiii. 11, I gave thee a king in mine anger.' So
   the murmuring Israelites had quails in anger: Ps. lxxviii. 31, Now
   Christ went willingly, that his own people might have everything from
   the heart of God as well as his hand: Jer. xxxii. 41, I will rejoice
   over them to do them good.' One of the conditions, as divines observe,
   how it may stand with the justice of God to punish the innocent for the
   nocent, is, if he be willing; for God could not have extorted our debt
   of Christ, unless he had been willing. When Paul would take Onesimus
   his debt upon himself, Philemon might justly require it of him: Philem.
   18, 19, If Onesimus hath wronged thee aught, put it upon my account,
   and I will repay it.' It would not stand with God's justice to force
   the obligation upon Christ, but Christ voluntarily engageth himself; if
   these souls owe thee aught, put it on my account--I will repay it.
   There was not only an ordination of God the Father, but a voluntary
   susception and undertaking of God the Son; he cheerfully and willingly
   submitted to have sin translated upon him, and to be liable by
   engagement; put that on my account, and I will repay it.

   2. That he might set off the worth of his love to us. Willingness and
   freeness commendeth a kindness, extorted courtesies lose their value.
   Therefore it is said, He loved us, and gave himself for us.' We see
   among men it would be ill taken to do a thing grudgingly. Decius [10]
   rode cheerfully into the gulf for the good of his country; nay, in some
   men it is a kind of corruption to be over-forward with their favours:
   Prov. xvii. 18, A man void of understanding striketh hands, and
   becometh surety in the presence of his friend;' that is, before his
   friend desires and seeks for it. Many men, rather than lose the praise
   of their kindness, undo themselves, their stock being soon spent. It is
   folly to be over-lavish and easy in such kindnesses. Therefore much
   more now would Christ commend his love to us: this ocean and
   overflowing of comforts being in Christ, it was the commendation of his
   love; he strikes hands and becometh surety before he is asked; it is
   the enhancement of Christ's love, and therefore he willingly submitted
   to it.

   But you will object, How did Christ do it willingly? did not he pray
   that the cup might pass from him? and did he not fear and stagger at
   it? Heb. v. 7, Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up
   prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, unto him that
   was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared.'

   I answer--1. Briefly, Christ's prayers are rather for our example and
   comfort, and that he might leave us a pattern where to go, and to whom
   to apply ourselves in all our straits, than to declare his willingness
   to decline this hot service: he would be tempted in all things like us,
   except sin, Heb. iv. 15, that he might be touched with the feeling of
   every infirmity.' He would be touched with such a conflict as came
   nearest to a sin of infirmity, but without sin. Jesus did it that we
   might know ourselves in the like case, when we struggle with the sense
   of guilt and the apprehension of divine wrath.

   2. To show himself truly man. Christ prayed against the cup, Father, if
   it be possible, let this cup pass.' He doth not contend with
   instruments, but beseech God. Christ's prayers against the cup were as
   the prayers of a private man; and so Christ would show all the passions
   of our nature; for if he had not prayed that the cup might pass, he
   must have put off all natural affections, because Christ, as a private
   person, looked upon it as a mere suffering, it being the nature and
   duty of man to decline all those things that are grievous and painful
   to him; and Christ having the same love, and hatred, and fear that we
   have, as a private person, he would manifest it at this time.

   3. As a common and public person, namely, as our Mediator and surety,
   so he was extremely willing and desirous to do this great office of
   love for us. For so it followeth, he sweetly submitted to his Father's
   will: Father, not my will, but thine be done.' Not my will as a private
   person, but thy will, which is more to a public person, let that be
   done; it was not in reference to the work, but how he should go through
   with it.

   2dly, For his fears: these were not a shrinking from the work, but only
   a natural consternation and retirement of the spirits upon so ghastly
   an apprehension as he then had of his Father's wrath against him for
   our sins. When the cold hands of death were put into his bosom to pluck
   out his heart, no wonder if there were a struggling; it is natural to
   be moved with things that are nigh. These fears were a part of the fire
   in which this sacrifice was to be burnt and offered to God. No wonder,
   therefore, if the Spirit of the Godhead did freely give up the manhood
   to be scorched with these fears: Mark xiv. 38, The spirit is willing,
   but the flesh is weak.' The willing spirit giveth up the flesh to this
   weakness.

   3dly, For his tears: they were such an eruption and overflow of his
   love; a part of that deluge by which he would drown the world of sin
   and wickedness.

   Divers inferences may be drawn from hence.

   Use 1. Is consolation, and that more generally. Here is comfort for
   believers, for your faith to feed upon. You may be sure that God
   accepted Christ for you, for he willingly offered himself to be a
   sacrifice for you. He went as a lamb to the slaughter, and this lamb
   taketh away the sins of the world. You have it twice proclaimed from
   heaven that God was well pleased with Christ--at his baptism and at his
   transfiguration: Mat iii. 17; and Mat. xvii. 5, This is my beloved Son,
   in whom I am well pleased.' God is pleased in Christ with you. Your
   willing sacrifices are acceptable to the Lord; God had no respect to
   Cain and his offering, because it was offered with a grudging mind. The
   Lord loveth a cheerful giver. Christ gave himself cheerfully and
   willingly for you; therefore the Lord loveth him, and loveth you for
   his sake. Among the heathens, a sacrifice that came unwillingly to the
   altar was thought ominous, as when the beast did show much reluctance,
   or did roar, or bleat much. O Christians! your sacrifice came
   willingly; he was not haled to the altar with rigour, but he went as a
   lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before her shearers is dumb.
   Go and urge it to God; willing sacrifices are pleasing to him; Jesus
   Christ did not offer himself with a grudging mind.

   2. More particularly, there is comfort against sad thoughts about sin.
   The great aggravation upon which the soul doth so bitterly reflect is
   the willingness of it; and, indeed, here lieth much of the evil of sin.
   It was that which heightened Ephraim's guilt, that he willingly walked
   after the commandment, Hosea v. 11; that is, so readily complied with
   Jeroboam's calves; and, indeed, the foulness of the fact is not so much
   to be gathered from the grossness of the acts of it, as from the
   propension, and inclination, and disposition of the heart towards it,
   and the fulness of the will to it, a deliberate ready-giving ourselves
   to it. Wilfulness in sin maketh the heart very sad when it cometh to
   see it. But, blessed be God, here is an answer to it--you have a
   willing Saviour. Though there be in you much reluctancy against God's
   will, and much readiness to offend, yet you could not be so ready to
   sin as Christ was willing to die for you: With desire have I desired to
   eat this passover.' How earnest was he to show his love! Have you felt
   the rage of lust in your bosoms? Christ felt the rage of love. He was
   straitened till he were baptized with blood for your sakes. This is the
   true reflection upon Christ, when we see enough in him to stop the
   mouth of conscience: Who shall condemn? it is Christ that justifieth.'

   Use 2. Is exhortation to bless and praise God. This was the endearment
   of his love, the willingness of it. Oh, how much are we indebted to
   him! The very argument that faith useth in the heart is the willingness
   of Christ to serve us in this business: Gal. ii. 20, I live by the
   faith of the Son of God, who hath loved me, and gave himself for me.'

   Use 3. Is instruction. It giveth out divers lessons, for Christ's life
   is a praxis of divinity, and the rules of religion exemplified.

   1. To show us how we should give up ourselves to the service of Christ,
   how we should come with the sacrifice of ourselves and duties with a
   ready and cheerful heart. When you feel any reluctancy and regret of
   spirit, oh, remember Christ offered himself willingly. The Socinians
   would make Christ's sufferings to serve for some other use, only to be
   exemplary; but certainly they were not only to leave us an example: I
   Peter ii. 21, Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example that we
   should follow his steps;' but he died in our room and stead, and for
   our sakes. And therefore we should give up our selves to him. The
   scripture speaketh often of the free-will offering of the saints: Ps.
   cxix. 108, Accept, I beseech thee, the free-will offering of my mouth,
   O Lord;' Ps. cx. 3, They shall be a willing people in the day of thy
   power.' Bernard saith, Lord, I will willingly sacrifice myself to thee,
   because thou wert willingly sacrificed for me. Christ was sacrificed
   willingly, not for his own gain but your benefit; and will you not give
   up yourselves to God, when it is better you should be given to him than
   left to yourselves?

   2. It showeth us what we should do in all our straits, wants, and
   calamities that befall us. The saints are as lambs in the midst of
   wolves, Luke x. 3: show yourselves lambs in suffering, as well as like
   lambs in danger, not like swine that whine and yell. You should not
   open your mouth against God. Do not please your own carnal mind by
   murmuring, but rather resign up yourselves to God's disposal; this is
   somewhat hard to do. The saints have been troubled with carnal
   reasonings, as Job, and David, and Jeremiah, and Habakkuk; but learn of
   a higher instance, Jesus Christ, who, though innocent, did not murmur
   under his sufferings, but bore all with a ready and willing patience.
   Oh, therefore yield up yourselves to God with great patience, both in
   life and death.

   3. It teacheth us not to use reviling and threatenings words to men.
   You may be wronged, so was Christ; he was more innocent than you can
   be, for it is impossible but something of the flesh will discover
   itself in us; but what a sad thing is it to see the people of God bring
   a railing accusation against others! Consider, Christ opened not his
   mouth, but went as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before
   her shearers is dumb.

THE EIGHTH VERSE.

   He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare his
   generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the
   transgression of my people was he stricken.

   WE now come to the third defence to take off the scandal of Christ's
   meanness and sufferings; and that is taken from the glorious issue and
   end of these sufferings. It was an ignominious death, but there
   followed a glorious resurrection: he was not detained and holden of
   death, he got clear of it, and then lived for ever. The text saith, He
   was taken from prison, and from judgment,' &c.

   There is scarce a verse in the scripture that hath been so variously
   expounded as this hath been, not only by others, but by the same men.
   Scarce a man hath agreed with himself positively to determine of the
   sense of it, the phrases looking so many several ways. However,
   difficulty provoketh endeavours. According as I apprehend them, you may
   divide them into two parts:--

   1. The scandal itself, laid down in the most aggravating terms prison,'
   judgment,' cutting off from the land of the living,' and a stroke upon
   him for transgression;' as if the prophet had said, Grant all that you
   will charge upon him, prison, judgment, strokes, cutting off, express
   it the worst way you can, all this will not impeach the glory of his
   excellency.

   2. We have the defence in other terms: He was taken' from those things,
   and who shall declare his generation?' If you think it is not enough to
   say that he died for others, and that he was stricken for the
   transgression of my people, yet he did not as every man that dieth for
   others; he perished not in this expression of his love, as others do:
   he was taken from prison, and from judgment, and now liveth gloriously.
   There are two things in the defence:--

   [1.] His resurrection: He was taken from prison and from judgment;' he
   got out from under it.

   [2.] His life and duration in that state: Who shall declare his
   generation?' These are the parts, which will be the better made out to
   you by going over the phrases, as they lie in the order of the words,
   clearing this scripture from a wrong sense.

   1. He was taken from prison and from judgment. These words have been
   variously translated and variously expounded. Some read by prison and
   judgment he was taken away;' but that doth not suit with the scope:
   others, after distress and judgment he was taken into glory;' that
   differeth not from the proper sense: others, without prison and
   judgment he was taken away in a violent, wrongful, extrajudicial
   manner;' but the Hebrew words do not so easily signify that. Now the
   main thing is to reconcile scripture and scripture, though it is
   impossible to reconcile interpreters. Therefore to dance after their
   pipe would perplex a man with much uncertainty, seeing they knew not
   which sense to take themselves. The Seventy translate it otherwise than
   it is read here, and the words are quoted in Acts viii. 32, en te, &c.,
   In his humiliation his judgment was taken away;' for that place hath
   the sense, though not the same words; for in or after his humiliation
   his judgment was taken away, when he was taken from it: in the middle
   of death he was a conqueror. Others now follow our reading, and give
   the sense thus: He was taken from prison and judgment to the cross;' as
   soon as bound and condemned, presently crucified. But that mistaketh
   the sense, and the following words show it is wrong, for they declare
   the glory of his resurrection, as these do his resurrection.

   Thus for the different opinions. The true sense briefly is, that Christ
   was taken and assumed into glory from the prison of the grave. Prison
   is taken metaphorically for any distress, or it may be taken properly
   for the prison of the grave, and that judgment and condemnation that
   was passed upon him by God and men: by God, as our surety, condemning
   him in our stead; by men, in an unjust and violent way. Thus, after
   much traversing the variety of senses, I find this to be best and most
   approved.

   2. It followeth, Who shall declare his generation? The Seventy, and
   Luke out of them, have it, te`n genea`n autou ti's diege'setai; Who
   shall declare his generation?' Some apply this to his eternal
   generation, as the fathers generally do,--as if the scandal of his
   misery were excused by that: others to his incarnation, who can declare
   it how he was begotten of the Virgin? But these are wide of the scope,
   and the word will not bear it. Others refer it to the wickedness of
   that age,--Who can tell it? Oh, the wickedness of such a generation,
   who would put to death such an innocent person as the Messiah! Who can
   declare the wickedness of the people of this generation? But that is
   but arresting the place, and a harsh sense. Others more properly
   interpret it thus: Who shall declare his generation? that is, the
   numerousness of those converts that shall be gained to him, the race or
   issue that shall come of the gospel? But this is the matter of another
   verse, and such a thing is never expressed by dor or gene'a properly,
   but by other words. The sense is, then, who shall declare his
   generation? that is, his age or duration: dor is often for that, and
   gene'a too: Acts xiii. 36, David, after he had served (gene'a) his age,
   or his generation, he fell asleep.' The like in other places. So that
   the meaning is, though he were a short time under distress and
   judgment, some two or three days; yet, when he was taken from it, who
   shall declare his generation? who shall be able to count the number of
   his age, or the date of that time? You may easily count the number of a
   man's age and the date of his generation: Ps. xc. 10, The days of our
   years are threescore years and ten.' But who can tell those many
   thousands of thousands of years, those endless ages that for ever
   Christ shall live? You can tell David's or Jacob's generation, but can
   you tell his? Theirs is soon reckoned, but who can find out a sum that
   can reach eternity? Thus for this phrase.

   3. It followeth, For he was cut off out of the land of the living: for,
   or though he were cut off; that is, though he were by a violent death
   cut off, yet he shall be taken thence and translated into glory, where
   he shall have a long and lasting age. Or you may take the particle
   causally, as we render it, for: here is a double reason, he was but cut
   off as a slip, and it was not for his own sins; and therefore there is
   reason why he should not miscarry under it: this will appear in the
   exposition. He was cut off' is a metaphor taken from plants or trees,
   that do not fall down of their own accord, but are slipped and plucked
   off. The same metaphor is used, Dan. ix. 25, The Messiah is cut off,
   but not for himself.' To which metaphor Christ himself seemeth to
   allude, Luke xxiii. 31, For if they do these things in the green tree,
   what shall be done in a dry?' The meaning is, if Christ himself be
   taken off, who was cut off as a green tree, and not planted again,--was
   taken from the land of the living; that is, from living and conversing
   here upon earth: and it is so called, both by way of opposition to the
   land of the dead, or the grave; and by a condescension of the Spirit of
   God to our weakness, because we count that none live but those that are
   before us. This phrase is often used: Ps. xxvii. 13, I had fainted
   unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of
   the living.' So Isa. xxxviii. 11, I shall not see the Lord, even the
   Lord, in the land of the living.'

   4. And for the transgression of my people was he stricken; or by the
   transgression, by the wickedness of Israel. He bringeth in God speaking
   it, as taking notice of their sin: Acts ii. 23, Him, being delivered by
   the determinate counsel of God, have ye taken, and by wicked hands have
   crucified and slain.' You may take both; it is like this may be the
   scripture Paul meaneth when he saith, I Cor. xv. 3, Christ died for our
   sins according to the scriptures;' either sense is good. The sum of all
   is this, that though Jesus Christ was so cruelly and despitefully
   handled for our sins, yet at length he was taken from all this
   suffering, and reigneth for ever with God in glory.

   Many points may be raised from these words; but having promised only to
   hint at the main things in these following verses, I shall take notice
   but of these few.

   Doct. 1. That by the divine appointment there was a formal process
   against Christ. He was made guilty, he was cast into prison, he was
   condemned. Sin was translated upon him in the former verses. Here God
   had him to prison, and let all his distresses come upon him; and so the
   grave especially he was condemned to; there was judgment passed upon
   him. And therefore, the next time you see your surety without sin; here
   you see him as under your sin in misery and distress: Heb. ix. 28,
   Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many, and unto them that
   look for him he shall appear the second time without sin unto
   salvation.'

   What comfort is there for believers in this, to support and strengthen
   their faith?

   1. In that whatsoever should be done to them, is done to Christ in
   their stead. It is comfort that Christ hath made full satisfaction,
   that he hath been in prison and under judgment for our sakes. God will
   not exact twice, of Christ and you too.

   2. It yieldeth them instruction as well as comfort, not to think it
   much if they be imprisoned, and be under judgment for Christ's sake.
   Christ hath been so for theirs, and you may be glad you are conformed
   to your head: Luke xxi. 12, Christ told the apostles, They shall lay
   their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the
   synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for
   my name's sake.' So it may be with you; but remember he was taken from
   prison and from judgment.

   3. Christ had a long reign for a short death. Christ's glory was in the
   midst of his sufferings, in his humiliation, that is, when most
   humbled. Christ did not recover glory till in the prison of the grave.
   We can easily count the time of his suffering, but his generation who
   can declare? 2 Cor. iv. 17, This light affliction, which is but for a
   moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
   glory.' An hyperbole, which is an expression greater than the truth,
   will not declare the glory. Hyperboles of hyperboles are not high
   enough; who can declare his generation?

   4. Those that are cut off from the land of the living may live again to
   glory. So the church, when buried as it were under its ruins, there
   will be a resurrection; and therefore the glory of the churches is
   called the first resurrection,' Rev. xx. Death is but a transplanting
   to glory to the godly; they are but a slip taken off from an earthly
   root, that God may set them in the field of glory. Alas! this life is
   nothing to the age and generation that we shall have with Christ in
   heaven; a man may die, and yet be saved from death.

   5. All Christ's sufferings were from men or by men. If there be
   anything shameful in the cross, blame the Jews for it, and yourselves
   for it. Many blame the Jews, and are ready to fly in their faces; but
   do you blame yourselves? It is hard to know which is meant by the
   transgression of my people,' or for,' or of my people.' God would have
   us reflect upon both. Christ, that died for the sins of men, was taken
   away by the sins of men, that so he might at the same time discover his
   personal innocency and assumed guilt.

   6. Oppressed innocency will get clear again: Who shall declare his
   generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living, for the
   transgression of my people.' It was not a just debt in regard of men,
   and therefore not a lasting death; and it was not for any fault of his
   own. It plainly hinteth the unexpected restitution of glory to the
   people of God in their greatest humiliation; their judgment is taken
   away: God can never come with help too late, but men can. In his
   humiliation, in his judgment, Christ showeth the meaning of that
   riddle, Though he kill me, yet I will trust in him.' There may be
   victory in death; the matter is never past help with God: Jonas in the
   whale's belly was recovered. We can never sink below hope and prayer.
   Our interest thrives best many times when the case is dead and
   desperate as to all appearance.

   These things having been observed, I now come to the main things
   intended in the text, and that is the glory of the resurrection, and
   the duration and continuance of that glory.

   The points are two:--

   1. That the Lord Jesus was taken from prison and from judgment, i.e.,
   he rose again out of the pit of distress, to which he was condemned for
   our sakes.

   2. That Christ being risen, liveth a numberless date of years, even for
   ever with God in glory.

   These two points, then, the resurrection of Christ, and the life of
   Christ: the first is from that clause, He was taken from prison and
   from judgment;' the other from that, Who can declare his generation?'

   I begin with the first point, that the Lord Jesus was taken from prison
   and from judgment, and rose out of the pit of distress, to which he was
   condemned for our sakes. He was taken from prison and from judgment; he
   did rise as Mediator, and could not choose but rise; he was not
   suffered to miscarry in it. The scriptures testify abundantly that he
   rose again: I Cor. xv. 3, 4, That he died for our sins, and rose again
   the third day, according to the scriptures.' And in other places, that
   he ought to rise again: Luke xxiv. 46, And thus it behoved Christ to
   suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day.' This Christ proveth
   out of the scriptures.

   Therefore I shall show you--(1.) Why he rose, by reasons reflecting
   upon the efficient cause; (2.) Why he ought to rise, reflecting upon
   the final causes and ends of God in Christ in it for our good.

   First, I shall show you why he rose, giving you the reasons for it;
   as--

   1. His own prayer. Christ's prayers were all granted, but especially
   those that were put forth with such vehemency and strong pouring out of
   his soul to his Father. He prayed for it with a great deal of holy
   fear, that he might not miscarry in the work. Therefore he was taken
   from prison and from judgment The apostle saith, Heb. v. 7, He was
   heard in that he feared; he offered up prayers and supplications, with
   strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from
   death.' He did not so much pray that he might not die, as that he might
   be saved from death; that having taken so much guilt upon him, he might
   not sink under it.

   2. God's power was put forth upon his prayer to support him. He had a
   Father to look after him, whose tenderness would not let him leave
   Christ in the grave, nor suffer his Holy One to see corruption. And
   therefore the resurrection of Christ is applied to God the Father; as
   here in the text, He was taken from prison and from judgment.' And Acts
   ii. 24, Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death,
   because it was not possible he should be holden of it.' He helped the
   grave to disburden herself, easing it of its pangs and throes: Rom.
   viii. 11, But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead
   dwell in you,' &c. The apostle speaketh of a mighty power of God, that
   is, of God the Father, which wrought in Christ when he raised him from
   the dead, Eph. i. 20. God the Father put forth his power to take off
   the pains of death and the chains of the grave.

   3. There was the power of his own Godhead; he had in himself a divine
   virtue to quicken his body. I distinguish this from the former, because
   God did not only raise Christ, but he raised himself, so as his
   resurrection might be a discovery of his Godhead. And therefore you
   shall find in scripture, that he is not only said to be raised by the
   power of God, but by himself, by his own person: Acts ii. 24, He loosed
   the pains of death, because it was not possible he should be holden of
   it.' The grave was to give up this hot morsel, as a man that hath
   swallowed down a hot bit was not able to hold it. The scriptures do not
   only ascribe the resurrection to God the Father, but to the Godhead of
   the Son too: John x. 17, I lay down my life, that I may take it again.'
   The words speak of Christ's taking up his life by his own power. He so
   laid down his life, that he might re-assume it again by his own power.
   It is said, 2 Cor. xiii. 4, that though he was crucified through
   weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God; for we are weak in him,
   but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.' And it is
   very like that expression of St Peter, I Peter iii. 18, Put to death in
   the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.' The apostle's scope in that
   place of the Corinthians is to prove that Christ and Christians are
   both alike in some respects: there is visible weakness, and inward
   power; he died through visible weakness. That which you could see in
   him was man's form, and so he was crucified; that which was not seen
   was his divinity, through the power of which he liveth. His
   resurrection was a glorious instance and manifestation of his own
   Godhead.

   Secondly, For what end Christ was raised. And here, that I may show
   believers the fountain of their comfort, why it ought to be that Christ
   should be raised from the dead, since all the comfort of the soul
   dependeth upon his getting above the grave, and shaking the powers of
   death, I will here a little refresh your spirits with the water of this
   well-spring of salvation; I will draw it up and pour it forth in three
   considerations. In regard of a moral necessity which I call
   conveniency, the good that we attain by Christ's getting the upper hand
   of the grave, and the confirmation of our souls in all the benefits of
   his purchase; for without his resurrection they had been nothing to us.

   1. Generally the resurrection is made to be the chiefest ground of
   comfort to Christians in the scripture; and therefore you shall find in
   scripture that this is made the great article: Rom. x. 9. If thou shalt
   confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart
   that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.' Mark,
   that is put as the main thing of Christianity, that God hath raised him
   from the dead: 2 Tim. ii. 8, Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of
   David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel.' Above all
   truths we must clearly preach that, and press that as if it were the
   life of all religion. Remember Christ is raised from the dead; and
   therefore it was a usual salutation among the Christians, The Lord is
   risen. The apostle maketh the triumph of faith chiefly to arise from
   this, Christ's resurrection: Rom. viii. 34, Who is he that condemneth?
   It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again.' If Christ
   had not risen, there would be but poor comfort to believers: I Cor. xv.
   14, If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith
   is also vain.' All would be to no purpose without this great seal and
   confirmation. It is a point of so great importance, that it is
   generally made the corner-stone in religion, the main hinge upon which
   gospel comfort hangs.

   2. More particularly to show you the benefits of it.

   [1.] All your spiritual enemies are subdued: Eph. iv. 8, When he
   ascended up on high, he led captivity captive;' that is, those things
   that usually captivate the spirits of Christians, they were forced to
   set off the triumph of Christ's ascension; he seized upon the spoils at
   his resurrection, and rode in triumph at his ascension to glory. Death
   is unstinged; death shall be served as Haman, when it thinketh to hurt
   believers, and shall honour them as he did Mordecai. You may die, but
   you are saved from death: 1 Cor. xv. 55, O death, where is thy sting? O
   grave, where is thy victory?' It followeth, Thanks be to God, who
   giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.' You can no more
   be held of the grave than Christ could be holden thereby. Hell is
   unarmed and subdued, and the powers of darkness triumphed over. Though
   the devil mustereth temptations against you, you can see all conquered
   by faith in Christ's resurrection: Your life is hid with Christ.' Then
   for sin, that is subdued: Christ gave it its death-wound upon the
   cross, and at his resurrection got above it. Then for the world,
   remember what Christ says, John xvi. 33, Fear not, little flock.' I
   have overcome the world;' that is, so conquered and triumphed over the
   world that it shall not hurt them. As for the devil, he trode him
   underfoot, and so shall Christians shortly: Rom. xvi. 20, The God of
   peace shall tread Satan under our feet shortly.'

   [2.] All spiritual blessings are procured for us. The blessedness of a
   Christian lieth in these three things: in pardon, grace, and glory; in
   justification, sanctification, and glorification. And all these are
   confirmed by Christ's being risen, and taken from prison and from
   judgment.

   (1.) For pardon or justification. If any one sin had remained
   unsatisfied for, Christ could riot have risen; every sin must be
   expiated with death: Rom. vi. 23, The wages of [every] sin is death;'
   and Christ would fulfil every tittle of the law, Mat. v. 18. But seeing
   he is got free, you may be sure he hath paid the wages of every sin: 1
   Cor. xv. 17, If Christ be not risen, your faith is vain, ye are yet in
   your sins.' While the surety is in prison, it is a sign the debt is not
   satisfied; but your surety is taken from prison and from judgment. Be
   of good comfort, all is paid: Rom. iv. 25, Who was delivered for our
   offences, and was raised again for our justification.' God had him to
   prison for the debt of the creatures, and took him from prison and from
   judgment for their comfort, and that they might be persuaded of his
   satisfaction.

   (2.) For the grace of sanctification; he rose that he might purchase
   the Spirit to raise us from the death of sin to the life of grace: Rom.
   vi. 4, That like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of
   the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.' By the
   same glory of the Father both is done, that is, by the same glorious
   power that raised Jesus from the dead: Phil. iii. 10, the apostle
   speaketh of the power of Christ's resurrection, that is, the virtue
   that goeth out from it unto believers.

   (3.) Glorification. Christ rose before us to open the way; and
   therefore he is called the first-fruits of them that slept,' 1 Cor. xv.
   20. Others rise as a single ear of corn, but Christ as the
   first-fruits. The first-fruits were consecrated in lieu of all the
   rest; so is Christ in your stead: Col. i. 18, Christ is called the
   first-born from the dead;' that is, the chiefest, and one that rose for
   us all,--the first that entered into heaven as a common person. There
   was a resurrection of some before the glorification of Christ's body,
   but he was the first-born that stood for all: Heb. vi. 20, Whither the
   forerunner is for us entered.' Jesus Christ is our forerunner, his
   resurrection doth make way for us to rise after him; he is our
   harbinger that is gone before.

   [3.] Consider what special thing there is in the resurrection of Christ
   above the other acts of the mediatorship, since the scripture layeth so
   much weight upon it. What is it that it contributes to the comfort of
   Christians above his death? It will be necessary to inquire after that,
   because the scripture speaketh so much of this circumstance, the
   resurrection of Christ from the dead.

   I answer--First, By way of confirmation: it confirmeth the heart in the
   expectation of salvation by Christ. By this it appeareth that the whole
   contrivance of salvation was a true thing; you have God's seal for it.
   It therefore confirmeth the heart in two things:--(1.) The person of
   Christ; and (2.) The office of Christ, upon which all hangeth.

   1. The person of Christ. There can be no greater proof of his divinity
   than the resurrection: 1 Peter i. 21, Who by him do believe in God,
   that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith
   and hope might be in God.' And, indeed, there our faith beginneth upon
   Christ's being God; as Peter saith, Your faith is built on God.' Well,
   then, here is God's seal to the heart, about the person of the Messiah:
   Rom. i. 4, Declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
   Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.' There the case
   was plainly and mightily decided that he was so, so as no man could
   contradict it: Truly this was the Son of God,' as the centurion cried.
   All were forced to say so by this instance. So Acts xiii. 33, he is
   said to be begotten of the Father.' He proveth it there to be at his
   resurrection, that is, declarativè; then it was evidently shown that he
   was begotten of the Father. Well, then, though the mercies of pardon,
   grace, and glory were merited by other acts of the mediatorship, yet
   they are confirmed and sealed by this, because this establisheth the
   soul in the ground of it--in the truth of the person of Christ.

   2. It sealeth to us the truth of his office, that this was he that was
   sealed to be Mediator. When the Jews taxed Christ for usurpation, he
   would confirm his office to them by no other sign but the resurrection:
   Mat. xii. 39, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign,
   and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet
   Jonas;' that is, that which answereth to the type of Jonas; and what
   was that but his lying three days and three nights in the grave and
   rising again? As if Christ had said, If you will have a miracle and a
   seal from heaven, that is all that I will give you. So you shall see
   upon another occasion, in John ii., when the Jews saw him
   authoritatively purging the temple, and acting as an extraordinary
   person, ver. 18, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest
   these things?' What confirmation hast thou from heaven to be the
   Messiah, that thou takest upon thee to reform the temple? Ver. 19,
   Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three
   days I will raise it up;' meaning the temple of his body,' ver. 21.
   There was all the sign he would give them, viz., his resurrection; this
   was the most proper confirmation of his office.

   Secondly, There is something by way of evidence,--it is a clearing and
   justifying of the merits of Christ. The benefits purchased by his death
   are evidenced to us in his resurrection; God must not only be
   satisfied, but it must be discovered to the world that God was fully
   satisfied, or else we should remain under doubts and perplexities
   still. Now the resurrection of Christ is the full discovery of that
   satisfaction that is made by his death. This is that that the fallen
   creature hath to show for it, that God was satisfied, even Christ's
   resurrection. You know, among men, when they pay debts, they look that
   the book be cancelled, and that they have an acquittance to show, if
   they should be challenged that the debt is not paid. Now, what have you
   to answer the challenge? What have you to show Satan when he impleadeth
   you before God? Why, by Christ's resurrection you may even challenge
   the challenger: Rom. viii. 34, Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ
   that died, yea, rather, that is risen again.' Why should God let him
   out of prison, if he had not paid the utmost farthing? He was taken
   from prison and from judgment. If Christ had been still in the prison
   of the grave, you must have looked for another surety that must make up
   his defects and satisfy where he could not: If Christ be not risen, ye
   are yet in your sins;' ye have nothing to show for your discharge. How
   could ye have answered Satan then, if your surety had miscarried? Thus
   by way of evidence.

   Thirdly, Something by way of pledge to us. By Christ's resurrection God
   giveth us a pawn and earnest, as it were, that we may expect the
   raising of our own bodies. You may plead it to God, and you may argue
   it for yourselves to God: Christ is raised, therefore raise me. And to
   yourselves, Therefore shall I be raised, because Christ was raised.
   Christ was acquitted from sins and received into glory: therefore,
   Lord, for his sake acquit me from my sins. Or shall I say, this is a
   pledge to us, that our persons shall be raised, justified, sanctified,
   glorified, because our head is raised? The apostle thinketh it is a
   good argument to prove the resurrection of our bodies by the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. xv.; and 1 Thes. iv. 14, For if we
   believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that sleep in
   Jesus will God bring with him.' The meaning is, that Christ's
   resurrection doth not only manifest a possibility, but a necessity of
   our rising with him. God hath in him given you an earnest of the
   resurrection, so as through Christ you may humbly challenge it at his
   hands--Lord, I believe thou wilt raise me to life everlasting. The
   wicked rise by the general power of God, but Christians rise with
   reference to Christ's resurrection; that was a pledge to them of
   theirs: and, therefore, it is observable, that presently upon the
   resurrection of Christ's body, there followed the resurrection of the
   bodies of some of the saints, that it might not only be a pledge, but
   that we might look upon it as a pledge to us: Mat. xxvii. 52, 53, And
   the graves were opened, and many bodies of saints which slept arose,
   and came out of their graves after his resurrection, and went into the
   holy city, and appeared to many.' There the virtue wrought immediately,
   that others of God's people might look for it, and the rest of Christ's
   mystical body expect their turn; not only the head, but some of the
   members rose too. Therefore, here is our comfort, because it is the
   great pledge and earnest that God hath given to the saints, namely,
   that, as it was done to Christ, so they may expect it shall be done to
   them.

   Fourthly, Something you may expect by way of influence. Every well of
   salvation hath its proper stream, and everything in a believer's heart
   hangs and depends upon some proportionable thing in Christ Jesus; our
   death to sin upon his death, our life upon his life, our holiness upon
   his holiness: John xvii. 19, For their sakes I sanctify myself, that
   they may be sanctified through the truth.' For whatever Christ had in
   himself as Mediator, he had it and did it for us. So that from these
   special things there is special causal influence on the hearts of
   believers. As from the resurrection of Christ our resurrection; from
   his death, the death of sin to the life of grace, or to the life of
   glory. There is causal influence from Christ's resurrection upon our
   hearts, which is the donation of the Spirit of God upon this act of
   Christ's resurrection, to raise us to grace and glory. And therefore we
   are said, 1 Peter i. 3, to be begotten to a lively hope by the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ.' Regeneration cometh from the virtue and
   influence of it, that passeth into our hearts for the conquering of
   sin, and begetting the new nature and the raising us to glory. But
   there is another benefit you are to expect by way of influence from the
   resurrection of Christ, even the gift of the Spirit, to conform you to
   your head. Christ by his resurrection being made a fountain of
   supernatural life, will^ send out vital influence. Wait for it, then;
   he will renew and heal you, and he will carry on the work, to the
   perfection of glory. Head and members must be conformable, as far as
   the model of the creatures will permit. Therefore, as sure as Christ is
   risen, you shall be raised with him to holiness here, and to heaven
   hereafter. That you may wait for this influence--

   1. Labour to get your union with Christ cleared to you. The passing out
   of virtue and influence from Christ depends upon that; the head doth
   not guide and act foreign members. Oh, say, then, if I were sure of my
   union with Christ, I should have this rich comfort. As the woman said,
   Mat. ix. 21, If I might but touch the hem of his garment, I shall be
   made whole.' The least evidence of an interest and union with Christ
   would fill us with wonderful comfort.

   2. Value it. Think it worthy of the best of your endeavours, and your
   greatest self-denial: Phil. iii. 10, That I may know him, and the power
   of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made
   conformable to his death.'

   Now this appeareth to be from the resurrection of Christ, for these
   three reasons:--From its influence--

   1. Because this is the most proportionable and suitable act in the
   creatures; and I take it for a spiritual principle that every act of
   grace hath a necessary dependence upon that work of Christ that is most
   suit able to it. Observe it, Christians, faith is mightily helped when
   you know that special well-head to which you must repair for the
   refreshment of your spirit in every exigence. It is not enough to know
   in the general that Christ must do all for you, and that he is the
   fountain of all mercies; but you must know particularly what is the
   spring of your comfort on such and such a needful occasion. In times of
   knowledge God will have our thoughts more explicit; and if you observe
   it, you will find that general and indistinct considerations do not
   work so effectually to the stablishing of the spirit. God would have
   you to see the provision he hath made for every need. Christ died for
   sin that you might die to sin; and Christ rose to glory that you might
   rise to grace and glory. The dependence and looking up of the creature
   must be to the most suitable act and work of the Messiah. Whole Christ
   carrieth in himself the complete work of our salvation, and the several
   acts and conditions of Christ are proportioned to the several acts and
   conditions of salvation.

   2. Because the same power that raised Christ raiseth us from death to
   life; and therefore clearly such influence is from the resurrection of
   Christ. This is evidenced in many places of scripture: Col. ii. 12, You
   are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath
   raised him from the dead.' It is the same operation of God. The meaning
   of that place is, that the life of faith was created in our souls by
   the same almighty efficacy of God by which Jesus Christ was raised from
   the dead. For the apostle proveth three things there: That whoever is
   in Christ is risen from death to life; and that this rising is by
   faith; and that this faith is wrought by the same power that raised
   Jesus from the dead. See another place, Eph. i. 19, 20, And what is the
   exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe, according to
   the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he
   raised him from the dead.' It was the same power, because it was the
   same power that procured it for us. God raised him up, that he might be
   a fountain and root of all supernatural life to us, that the power
   might work in his as well as him. So Rom. viii. 11, If the Spirit of
   him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised
   Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his
   Spirit which dwelleth in you.' Mark, it is the same Spirit. The power
   of the Spirit is put forth to raise Christ, and the power of the Spirit
   is put forth to raise you. This is not done by the consideration of
   Christ's resurrection, but by the power of the Spirit accompanying it.
   It is the Spirit that doth effectually apply this raising and begetting
   power.

   3. Because the Spirit worketh always with reference to this act and
   work of Christ. It raiseth you with respect to Christ's resurrection;
   and that is the meaning of these phrases which do abound in scripture,
   that couple the soul and Christ together in all his works, as crucified
   with him, raised with him. For the latter, take these places: Eph. ii.
   5, Even when we were dead in sins hath he quickened us together with
   Christ, and hath raised us up together.' So Col. ii. 13, So you, being
   dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he
   quickened together with him;' so Col. iii. 1, If ye be risen with
   Christ, seek the things which are above.' Divers such kinds of
   expressions there are in the word, which make out the soul's sharing
   with Christ in the virtue of these works. The Spirit revealeth to them
   that they are not only to be raised with Christ, but that they are
   raised, and so make it a powerful argument to heavenliness, or any
   other part of the new creature. This is done already in the root and
   mystical notion, and therefore it should be done in the effectual
   application. I say, the Spirit revealeth to the soul the resurrection
   of Christ, and that he is our head, and the fountain of our life; and
   therefore we should live and be conformed to our head. And by such
   considerations the Spirit leaveth a great virtue and force upon the
   soul, which is called the power of the resurrection.' And thus I have a
   little opened this difficult matter to you. Take but one place more and
   I have done: Rom. vi. 10, 11, For in that he died, he died unto sin
   once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.' There are Christ's
   acts. Now in the next verse you shall see how the Spirit maketh the
   soul to share in them: Likewise reckon ye also your selves to be dead
   indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.'
   Dead by the death of Christ, but alive by the life of Christ. The
   Spirit cometh to the heart, and revealeth this to it. Lo, this is done
   for you in Christ, and so bringeth the soul by the same efficacy to a
   likeness to Christ.

   Use 1. Is consolation. Here is comfort for those that have an interest
   in Christ. Believers, know the ground of your privileges. Christ is
   risen, and thereby declared mightily to be the Son of God. So shall you
   be declared mightily to be the sons of God at your resurrection: Ps.
   xxxvii. 5, Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he
   shall bring it to pass.' Oh, what comfort is there for their spirits in
   that word, Christ is risen.' It was the comfortable message Christ sent
   to Peter, when he was ready to faint under the sadness of his own
   apprehensions, Go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is risen, and
   goeth before you into Galilee.' Mark xvi. 7--Go to Peter, and tell him
   by name. O poor Peter! he is weeping and ready to break his heart; go
   and comfort him, be sure to tell him I am risen. Christians, here is
   comfort for the saddest believer. Among the primitive Christians their
   usual salutation was, The Lord is risen; as if that were as much as
   wishing them all peace and grace.

   But how shall we do to draw out these comforts?

   Ans. Act faith, which bringeth in the virtues of Christ upon the soul.

   But how must we act faith in this matter of the resurrection of Christ?
   It consists in reasoning and waiting. There is something you must
   collect by way of inference, and something you must expect by way of
   influence.

   First, Set faith a-work, or arguing by way of inference. You must
   collect somewhat that you may extract the quintessence of it. As a
   surety, as a common person, and as a pattern of providence and church
   dispensations, in all these respects you may fetch comfort from
   Christ's resurrection. I shall a little clear these three
   considerations of Christ, though the two first be somewhat common among
   divines.

   1. As a surety, and one that undertook for us; that is clear, because
   Christ is called the surety of a better testament.' Heb. vii. 22. Now
   your surety is risen, then draw out the comfort thus: Surely sin is
   satisfied, for the debt is paid. A man is never the richer for gold in
   the mine till it be digged out; no more is a man the better for
   comforts in the lump; dig them out by holy reasoning. Say then, Christ,
   that undertook all, he is got free again; surely then I am discharged,
   I have something to show to God. Go and urge it to the Lord Why didst
   thou suffer Christ to rise again, if thou wilt charge poor creatures
   with their guilt? And urge it to Satan too Dost thou condemn me, and
   tell me what I have done, and wherein so often I have sinned?--Why,
   Jesus Christ is risen. As Paul: Rom viii. 34, Who is he that
   condemneth? it is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again.'
   Surely the whole business is accomplished by Christ. Thus dwell upon
   such thoughts; only take heed you rest not in your own reasonings--look
   for the success of all from the Spirit. O Lord, didst thou not let
   thine only-begotten and well-beloved Son, Jesus Christ, go free, after
   he had been in the prison and in the grave? Did not he undertake for
   us, and hast thou discharged him and not us? He is our surety, he hath
   paid our debt for us. Therefore reason with your souls as David
   reasoned with his soul: Ps. xlii. 11, Why art thou cast down, O my
   soul, and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I
   shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.'

   2. As a common person, Christ may be said to be all of us; for as Adam,
   in a sense, was all mankind, so Christ had all the elect in his own
   person, and so represents them: so that what he did we may, in some
   sense, be said to have done. Thus, a burgess in parliament, that
   represents all the town or corporation that sendeth him, his act is
   their act: it is grounded upon what the apostle saith, 1 Cor. xv. 22,
   As in Adam all died, so in Christ shall all be made alive.' As Adam was
   a common person representing all mankind, so Christ all the elect.
   Therefore the apostle saith, Rom. vi. 11, Reckon ye also yourselves
   dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our
   Lord.' You must do two things:--

   [1.] Interest yourselves in the acts of your common person. Reason
   thus--If we are united to Christ, then we shall share in all his
   purchased benefits: I am crucified with Christ.' Gal. ii. 20; and I am
   risen with Christ. You are instated by virtue of your union in all
   Christ's acts: Christ was raised, therefore I shall rise; Christ was
   taken to glory, therefore I shall be so. Urge it to God--O Lord, did I
   not rise out of the dust in Christ? Lord, didst thou not take me out of
   the devil's power when thou tookest Christ out of the grave?

   [2.] You must reason from this privilege against present distress--Is
   it the evil of sin? Rom. vi. 2, How shall we that are dead to sin live
   any longer therein?' Am not I dead to sin in Christ, and alive to this
   grace in Christ? Then reason from your privileges; I am above this
   cross, for Christ is, and shall I sink under it? I am in this glory
   already, as united to Christ, who is there, and shall I despair of it?
   Is not my head there, and will the head be severed from the rest of the
   members in the mystical body?

   3. As a pattern of Providence: for God meant to copy out all his
   dispensations to his people in the life of Christ. There is not a
   providence happeneth to the church or to believers but there is
   something therein conformable to the life of Christ. For look, as all
   dispensations typed out Christ, as the children of Israel's going out
   of Egypt did, for which see that of Hosea, I called my Son out of
   Egypt.' Hosea xi. 1, which is cited, Mat. ii. 15, Out of Egypt I called
   my Son;' and as Jonas, being three days and three nights in the whale's
   belly, did; so Christ is the type of all providences after him. There
   is no misery but some passage of Christ's life is parallel to it. Out
   of all these considerations you may fetch a great deal of comfort.
   Reason then against all the depths of misery into which you may be
   cast; I shall get free, for Christ got free; I see the success in the
   story of Christ's life. Is it the depth of inward misery? Ps. xviii. 5,
   The sorrows of hell compassed me about, and the snares of death
   compassed me.' So they did Christ, yet he got free of them, as the
   apostle saith, Heb. xii. 2, Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher
   of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the
   cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
   throne of God.' Is it outward misery? None could have more distress
   upon him than Christ, yet he was taken from distress and judgment. Is
   it death? Christ died and rose again. Either God will preserve you from
   the evil, or he will order it so that it shall not hold you. Christ
   could not be holden of death when it seized upon him. Is it reproaches?
   It may be you are buried in the scorn of the world, and crowded under
   disrespects and abasures--so was Christ before you.

   We now come to the second considerable circumstance in the text, and
   that is the life of Christ: Who shall declare his generation?' As
   Christ saith, I am the resurrection and the life,' that is, the cause
   of both; for Christ did not only rise, and not only live, but he was
   the resurrection and the life. He rose as a resurrection, and he liveth
   as a life. And therefore all our spiritual rising and living is from
   his rising and living. But having spoken of his resurrection, it will
   be necessary to inquire into his life.

   Doct. That Christ, being risen, liveth a numberless term of years, even
   for ever, with God in glory.

   Who shall declare his generation? That is so long that it cannot be
   reckoned. Those that have the best skill in numbers cannot rise high
   enough to reach his age. By what sum will you express eternity?
   Thousands of thousand thousands can scarce be admitted to be a shadow
   of it: Heb. vii. 3, Having neither beginning of days, nor end of life;'
   which is to prove, not that Christ as God should live for ever, but
   Christ as Mediator, as God-man, under which notion he is considered
   here.

   1. Because at his resurrection he was cleared from sin, and so was no
   more liable to death. The apostle saith, Rom. v. 12, that death entered
   by sin.' It did so upon Christ as well as upon us when he took our
   guilt: 1 Peter iv. 1, He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased
   from sin,' being cleared at his resurrection. When he ceased from
   suffering he ceased from sin. Therefore the apostle saith, 1 Tim. iii.
   16, He was justified in the Spirit,' and manifested to the world in the
   flesh; that is, they saw him, but because of his miser able appearance,
   they could judge nothing but that he was a sinner; but when his Godhead
   came to be discovered at his resurrection, then he was justified in the
   Spirit. Therefore now he is no more liable to death. Christ was not
   justified, neither by God nor men, till that time. Now he is raised, he
   is exempt from it, as the apostle urgeth, Rom. vi. 9, Christ, being
   raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over
   him.' Death can lord it no more over Christ, as it seemed to do for a
   while; but now Christ hath destroyed death: Rev. i. 18: I am he that
   liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have
   the keys of hell and death.' Death and hell thought to make sure of
   Christ, and to have him under lock and key, as it were; but he could
   not be holden by them. But now Christ hath the power of death and hell,
   so that none goeth there but whom he pleaseth. Amen; it is very certain
   it is so. This is the first reason; having fully cleared the debt
   wherein he stood engaged to divine justice, he is no more liable to
   death.

   2. That he might become a principle and fountain of life to us.
   Whatever Christ hath as Mediator, he hath it for us. He lived for us
   upon earth, and he died for us; and he liveth for ever for us in
   heaven: 1 Thes. v. 10, Who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep,
   we should live together with him.' His life of glory is our life, as
   well as his life of grace; and therefore he is said to be the
   Resurrection and the Life:' 1 John v. 11, 12, And this is the record,
   that God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He
   that hath the Son hath life;' that is, the testimony of God's bounty,
   eternal life, which is by virtue of his life. And so Christ is said to
   have life in himself: John v. 26, For as the Father hath life in
   himself, so he hath given to the Son to have life in himself;' that is,
   to have an original fountain of life. No creature in the scripture
   notion hath life in itself.

   3. That he might perform all the other acts of the mediatorship, and so
   be doing something continually in heaven for the elect of God, that he
   may apply the merit of his sufferings, death, and resurrection. Past
   acts would not satisfy the spirit; they are more immediately for the
   comfort of those that have some evidence of their right in Christ. The
   soul saith, Here is much done, but what was this to me? This was done
   for those that have interest in Christ, as his sufferings, dying, and
   resurrection. Ay! but Christ liveth; there is something a-doing
   still--there is something a-negotiating in heaven for you. Therefore,
   he not only negotiated for you by the past acts of his life upon earth,
   his death, burial, and resurrection, but he yet liveth to be doing for
   you. His office required this: Heb. vii. 16, Who is made not after the
   law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.'
   The meaning is, the Levitical priests were by the law of carnal rites
   for a while, but Christ for ever. As a judicious divine observeth,
   present acts do most satisfy such doubtful spirits. Christ's life in
   heaven is for the effectual application of his merit, and other the
   great offices of the mediatorship.

   But what doth Christ in heaven for us?

   1. He intercedes for us: Heb. vii. 25, Wherefore he is able also to
   save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever
   liveth to make intercession for us.' That is the end of his life, to
   beseech the Father for such as come to him; he intercedeth for the
   application of his merit. Christ is a continual remembrancer in heaven,
   as it were, to God the Father; he is praying that you may believe; he
   is our soul's solicitor, as it were, to appear and plead our cause in
   heaven for us: Heb. ix. 24, he is said to appear in the presence of God
   for us,' as our agent in heaven. He proveth the matter, he prayeth for
   what thou prayest for, and liveth to appear before God for you in all
   your straits.

   2. That he may seize upon his kingdom, and administer it to the
   destruction of his adversaries. Christ's life is their death: Ps. cx.
   1, The Lord said unto nay Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make
   thine enemies thy footstool.' Christ must live, that they may fall and
   be under the feet of Christ. So the apostle saith, 1 Cor. xv. 25, For
   he must reign till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.' At the
   time of his ascension Christ was solemnly inaugurated into the regal
   office, that, so he might destroy his adversaries: Rev. xvii. 14, The
   Lamb shall overcome.' It is Christ shall fight against them. Isa.
   lviii. 8, Thy righteousness shall go before thee.' That which is
   comfort to God's people, is terror to the adversaries; if they could
   make sure work of him, their business were at an end; but Christ is
   alive to destroy their persons, and blast their designs. Some of the
   people of God may fall before them, and all visible supplies may be
   dead, as Sarah's womb; but the Lord liveth, and blessed be my rock, and
   let the God of my salvation be exalted.'

   3. That he may dispense all necessary supplies to the needs of his
   servants: Eph. iv. 10, When he ascended up on high, he gave gifts to
   men;' that is, all necessary supplies for his servants. As a fountain
   of living waters continually feedeth the stream, so you have a living
   Christ who will continually supply the streams of grace;. he knoweth
   your needs, and can supply them. And therefore the apostle maketh the
   main business of salvation to hang upon the life of Christ: Rom. v. 10,
   For if when we were enemies we were reconciled by the death of his Son,
   much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life;' that is, can
   we want anything necessary to salvation, that have a living Christ to
   go to? You may be sure, if by his death he could bring you into such a
   glorious estate, now he is alive he will not be wanting to you.

   Use 1. Is information. Learn hence divers truths:--

   1. What is the fountain of spiritual life, to wit, the life of Christ;
   and, therefore, it is called the life of God, and the life of Christ,
   in many places of scripture: Alienated from the life of God.' Eph. iv.
   18; It is God and Christ that liveth, and liveth in us, Eph. iii. 17;
   and Col. iii. 3, Your life is hid with Christ in God,' and Christ that
   liveth in me.' Gal. ii. 20. Again, When Christ, who is our life, shall
   appear.' Col. iii. 4. As things are hid in their causes, flowers in
   their root, till their appearance at spring, so the glory of spiritual
   life is hid in its cause and fountain.

   2. That true believers cannot wholly fall away. Christ liveth for ever,
   and, therefore, they shall live for ever; the life of Christ cannot
   wholly be abolished in them. When you can dig up the spring and
   fountain, then grace may wither, and you may be lost in a seducement
   and a temptation, but now you are kept by the power of an endless life.
   The perpetuity of the saints, if it had no other ground but this, would
   remain unshaken; therefore, it is said, We are preserved in Jesus
   Christ,' Jude 1. Christ's life is their life, and Christ's life is such
   a numberless age, that none can count it.

   3. That Christ is a fit object for worship and service. Every being is
   the more noble, the more life it hath in it; the life of things is the
   commendation of them: Eccles. ix. 4, A living dog is better than a dead
   lion;' better, that is, more noble. Now, since Christ hath the noblest
   and the highest being, he liveth for ever. The scriptures often call
   upon us to trust in the living God: Ps. xlii. 2, My soul thirsteth for
   the living God.' Who would go to the dead cistern, and leave the living
   fountain? Alas! what is a man the better for a dead idol? All the
   satisfaction of the spirit lieth in the life of him whom we worship.
   Now Christ is not only living, but living for ever. Your hopes in him
   will not run waste. A prince, whose breath is in his nostrils, may
   uphold his favourites during his life, but upon his death they may be
   brought from the crown of their excellency to the dust of scorn and
   ignominy; but Jesus Christ never dieth. As Bathsheba said to David, 1
   Kings i. 21, When my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, I and
   my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.' All their care and cost is
   lost; but it cannot be so with Jesus Christ; he liveth to make you
   everlastingly happy.

   Use 2. Is for the discovery of hypocrites, that pretend to Christ, but
   live as if Christ were in the grave still, as if he were a dead Christ,
   as if there were no life nor virtue in him.

   But how shall we know what is the life of Christ? I answer--By three
   things: there will be freeness, and there will be power, and there will
   be likeness to Christ.

   1. There will be freeness towards God. The heart is sweetly drawn out
   to comply with the mind of Christ. Christ doth not live in you, if
   there be not a willingness in you to be like him. The Spirit of Christ
   supplieth the place of a law in such a soul: Rom. viii. 2, For the law
   of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of
   sin and death.' Outward letters and the rule could not make him free,
   and disentangle him from his corruptions, but the Spirit of the Lord
   Jesus evangelising the law of God, did. The law is made gospel by the
   Spirit in the life of Christ; it giveth the heart a sweet liberty and
   freedom towards God. The tears of those that pray are sweeter than the
   joys of the theatre.

   2. There will be power, there will be something besides cold forms and
   slight pretences; 2 Tim. iii. 5, Having a form of godliness, but
   denying the power.' That which the apostle calleth the power and force
   of godliness is a real impression and operation upon the heart; there
   will be somewhat besides empty profession and barren speculation; there
   will be somewhat that you may call power and mighty working,' as the
   apostle calleth it everywhere. Now, when there is no working upon the
   spirit answerable to knowledge or pretences, what a dead Christ do such
   make him!

   3. There will be likeness to Christ. Christ as surely liveth in
   believers now, as he once lived upon the earth in his own person. And
   you know three things were eminent in the person of Christ when on
   earth:--Obedience to his Father: he often professeth that he came to do
   the will of his Father: John iv. 34, My meat is to do the will of him
   that sent me, and to finish his work.' But we drink in iniquity like
   water; our meat and drink is to sin against the Father. That is the
   meaning of that phrase before mentioned, Job xv. 16. Then for his
   humility: Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.' Mat. xi. 29.
   He could have given the world another pattern: Learn of me, for I made
   the world; I can do wonders. But Christ would teach this lesson, Not as
   I am mighty, but meek: Phil, ii. 5, Let this mind be in you which was
   also in Jesus Christ.' What was that? A humble mind, as you may see in
   the context. And then usefulness: that was eminent in him; he went
   about doing good. Laziness and selfishness were abhorred by him. If
   Christ would make Christians more useful, he would still act according
   to his old copy, and live over his life in their hearts again. Search
   then; is the living God a dead thing to you?

   Use 3. For reproof to the people of God, that do not draw out this life
   of Christ. Believers, Christ should not only live in heaven, but he
   should live in you also: Not I, but Christ that liveth in me,' Gal. ii.
   20. Christians are to blame especially in their conflicts with sin, and
   the difficulties of duty, and the hardships of the world, and they
   faint under miseries, as if there were not a living Christ, whence they
   might fetch comfort. A Christian should say, The Lord liveth, and
   blessed be my Rock. You should make his power useful in your worst
   condition; your lives should be nothing else but a discovery of the
   life of Christ in yourselves: 2 Cor. iv. 10, the apostle saith that he
   suffered terrible things with a courageous heart, That the life also of
   Jesus might be manifested in our body.' Noble actings of grace hold
   forth the life of Christ, as effects discover the cause. And by your
   conversations it should appear there is one liveth in heaven.

   Use 4. Is consolation in all conditions. Is it sin that is grievous to
   you? doth it leave a wound upon the soul? There is one that liveth in
   heaven; that prays for the binding up of your souls, and for the
   healing of the wounded spirit; he is negotiating the matter with God
   for you. Is it death? Christ liveth, though you die; and though you
   were dead, yet shall you live: Hosea vi. 2, After two days he will
   revive us; in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in
   his sight.' Are friends dead? Remember your Friend in heaven liveth for
   ever. Are your hopes dead as Sarah's womb and Abraham's body? Yet
   Christ is alive still. Succours may miscarry, supports may fail,
   violence may cut off your comforts; but no hand of iniquity can reach
   Jesus Christ. He liveth for ever with God in glory.

   Use 5. Is exhortation to believers:--

   1. To wait for the like privileges. Oh, who shall count your generation
   when you shall come to share with Christ? You know the longings of
   Christ's heart towards you, and that you shall behold his glory: John
   xvii. 24, Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me may be
   where I am, that they may behold my glory.' You are to enjoy the same
   endless life of bliss and glory. Oh, groan and wait for the consolation
   of the saints in heaven. For the present you have rich privileges, but
   alas! this is nothing: It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we
   know when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him
   as he is,' 1 John iii. 2.

   2. Possess your souls of this life of Christ, and by faith see
   yourselves in him: Rom. vi. 10, Reckon ye also yourselves dead indeed
   unto sin, but alive unto God.' Dead first in his death, then raised in
   his resurrection, and at last glorified in his glory. All these acts of
   the Mediator must pass out into your souls; first I was dead to the
   law, dead to sin, dead to the curse; but then, shall live and die no
   more.

   3. Strive to be conformed to your head. He is to die no more; do not
   you die any more in sin. There is in every action of Christ influence
   and matter of imitation: influence, of which you must possess
   yourselves; but matter of imitation is that to which you must be
   conformed. Oh, strive to keep in the same condition with your dear Lord
   and Saviour. If death hath no more dominion over him, let not sin reign
   in your mortal bodies,' Rom. vi. 12. From the same enforcement the
   apostle urgeth it; and indeed for a motive you can have no better than
   what the subject offereth. Christ would not only suffer for you for a
   time, but lives for your sake for ever. Christ spendeth all his time to
   do you good.

THE NINTH VERSE.

   And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death;
   because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.

   THE prophet goeth on with the account of Christ's sufferings, and
   showeth that he should at length be humbled to the grave, and brought
   thither in a most ignominious manner. Yet, however, there was no cause
   why the Jews should stumble at it, and dash the foot of their faith
   against this rock, for God had made provision ample enough against this
   offence and scandal. Even his grave, that seemed to obscure his glory,
   did in some measure illustrate it: He made his grave with the wicked,
   and with the rich in his death, because,' &c.

   Here are in this verse, as in many of the former, two parts
   considerable:--

   1. The Jews' scandal: he made his grave with the wicked.

   2. The prophet's defence, which you have--

   [1.] By the circumstances which made for the glory of Christ: and with
   the rich in his death.

   [2.] By asserting his innocency--

   (1.) In respect of open and gross sins: he hath done no violence.

   (2.) In respect of secret and hidden sins: neither was any deceit found
   in his mouth. All these parts will more plainly appear in the
   explication. There are no verses have been so severally expounded as
   this and the former. I should perplex your thoughts too much to give
   you the differences. Some distinct senses there are: I shall only give
   you what I conceive to be the positive and plain sense, by going over
   the phrases.

   And he made. There may be a question to whom this he must be referred,
   for the number being so often changed, we can have no relief from the
   context. There are three persons spoken of in the chapter: God the
   Father, God the Son, and the Jews. If this he be applied to God the
   Father, then the sense is, he dispensed and ordered it so by his
   providence that his grave should be appointed among the wicked; and so
   it points at the divine decrees, which implied that Christ should be
   executed as an offender, and be buried in an ignominious manner, as
   other offenders are, for aught could be discerned at first. This
   suiteth with the Seventy, who bring in God the Father speaking this
   clause, though they read the sentence a little otherwise than we do:
   do'so tou`s ponerou`s, &c., I will give the wicked for his grave.' Or
   it may be referred to God the Son,--his patience, who submitted so, as
   it seemed to hold forth nothing but as if he were to have had the
   burial of an ordinary malefactor, he submitting to it till a further
   declaration of God's pleasure; a man could have guessed nothing else.
   Or, he made, may be referred to the people of the Jews; they did as
   much as in them lay that Christ should have the burial of a wicked man:
   He made,' that is, by their ordination. You may take either or all very
   commodiously. It followeth, and with the rich in his death.' There is a
   great deal ado about what is meant by rich. Some understand the term,
   as Calvin, equivalent with the wicked; because riches puff up men's
   minds and dispose them to injury and violence. Junius understands
   Pilate; others have different apprehensions of the place. I shall take
   liberty to recede from them; for by this phrase, the rich in his
   death.' I understand Joseph of Arimathea; and the meaning I conceive
   thus, that though at his crucifixion his grave was intended to be with
   ordinary malefactors, yet God ordered it so that he should be
   honourably interred by a rich person, Joseph of Arimathea: With the
   rich in his death,' that is, after his death. And my reasons for this
   interpretation are two:--

   1. Because the word for rich, aasir, in the Hebrew, is in the singular
   number, and so noteth some eminent rich man that had to do about the
   grave and sepulchre of Christ; and that was Joseph of Arimathea.

   2. Because the evangelist Matthew seemeth, as with a finger, to point
   to this place when he saith, Mat. xxvii. 57, When the evening was come,
   there was a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was
   Jesus' disciple, and he went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.'
   And besides, the place is most sweetly and without wresting opened.
   And, indeed, the following words yield us a twofold reason:--

   [1.] Because God would right his innocency in the midst of calumnies
   and reproaches. God would not have an innocent buried among
   malefactors; and, therefore, by the care of Joseph and Nicodemus, he
   would have it testified to the world that there were some thought him
   innocent and worthy of an honourable burial.

   [2.] It may well be to show the suitableness of it. He would have a new
   kind of man laid in a new grave, in which no man was ever laid. It
   could be said of no man but Christ that no iniquity and guile was found
   in him; and therefore he was put in a sepulchre in which no man was
   laid. For now God began to honour Christ because he had done no
   violence. In Peter, it is, Who did no sin;' for indeed the word must be
   taken so generally, anomi'as. It is meant, no gross fact could be
   charged upon him; neither was there deceit in his mouth; that is, he
   was guilty of no secret evil: for no guile in the mouth argueth there
   was none in the heart--there being a swift intercourse between the
   heart and the tongue: James iii. 2, If any man offend not in word, the
   same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body.'

   Thus for the phrases. The sum of all is this, that though the Messiah
   was taken away by a shameful death, and therefore likely to be looked
   upon as an eminent instance of divine wrath and vengeance, yet the Lord
   provided for his glory in the midst of this ignominy, by procuring such
   a sepulchre and burial for him as might set out not only his innocency
   but his honour; for he indeed was without fault and blame.

   There is not much to be observed out of this verse, yet that which is,
   is very comfortable, and therefore in the general take these notes.

   1. There is a sweet harmony and accord between the Old and New
   Testament; they agree in the least things. Isaiah saith, He made his
   grave with the rich;' and Matthew saith, a rich man of Arimathea came
   and begged his body.' So in other things you may observe there is an
   agreement in those things which a man would judge to be of least
   consequence.

   Note 2. That every passage of Christ's life is considerable; as this
   concerning the account of his burial. A man would have thought it had
   not been so worthy of observation, and yet the prophet speaketh of it
   as an eminent circumstance, and you shall see much use may be made of
   it by and by. So, for Christ's name, Mat. i. 23, They shall call his
   name Emmanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God with us.' So the
   offering for him a pair of turtle-doves and two young pigeons. Man
   would easily overlook these things, yet the Holy Ghost thought them
   worthy the noting. Oh, study Christ's life more; there is no waste
   passage in it. But what benefit is there in the text? I shall not here
   give you doctrines, as I did from the other verses, but direct you, for
   your comfort, to look upon Christ under a threefold notion, viz., as
   our surety, as a pattern of providence, and as a great example.

   1. As a surety; so there are two clauses that afford comfort to
   believers:--

   [1.] That he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich is
   death.' That expression, He made his grave with the wicked,' holdeth
   forth the payment of the debt, and full evidence of his satisfaction.
   Your surety suffered in your stead. Cursed is every one that continueth
   not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.'
   And the Lord Christ was accursed to redeem us from the curse of the
   law. But I shall chiefly take notice of this circumstance, And with the
   rich in his death.' After Christ had once died, God began to honour
   him: full satisfaction being made to God, and the reproach and shame
   due to sins taken away; after death he had an honourable interment. Of
   all people, the Jews did most look to burials. It was a great
   threatening that they should die unburied: Prov. xxx. 17, The eye that
   mocketh at his father, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and
   the young eagles shall eat it;' alluding to the shameful death and
   burial of the disobedient son. And again, Ps. lxxix. 3, There should be
   none to bury him.' And Jer. xxii. 19, He shall be buried with the
   burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.'
   But now Christ had not only a decent but an honourable burial. Well,
   then, Christians, here is encouragement for your faith. Christ was
   honoured as soon as he died: the work is ended--the last act of his
   humiliation was the first step to his exaltation, and there began his
   triumph and glory. Joseph and Nicodemus, two of his devout followers,
   they celebrate his funerals, and bury him with such solemnities as are
   due to persons of the greatest honour. Well, then, conclude in faith,
   that by Christ's death, shame, and sufferings, sin is done away.
   Christians were wont to solemnise their funerals with psalms of
   thanksgiving. You may remember Christ's funeral with rejoicing and
   giving of thanks: there you have the first intimation that the work was
   finished, sins were satisfied for, shame and reproach began to vanish.
   O you redeemed of the Lord, go forth and rejoice. God beginneth to take
   off the ignominy of Christ's death, and thereby your ignominy and your
   shame. So that now, In him we have boldness and access with confidence
   by the faith of him.' Eph. iii. 12; that is, you may freely have
   communion and social commerce with God, your shame being gone; God hath
   branded sin with shame. Adam hid himself; the captains and great men
   called to the mountains to cover them from the wrath of the Lamb, they
   could not endure the sight of God. Guilt maketh a fallen countenance,
   and causeth a shyness of God. Now you may lift up your heads, your
   shame is taken away.

   [2.] From that clause, Because he had done no violence, neither was any
   deceit in his mouth.' Your surety was a pure person he had no guilt of
   his own to satisfy for, and so it yieldeth not only an encouragement to
   faith, but an endearment of love to Christ. All these sufferings were
   for you, there is nothing that can argue a need for himself to do it.
   The scriptures everywhere urge and testify this: 1 John iii. 5, And ye
   know that he was manifested to take away our sins, and in him is no
   sin.' All his sufferings were for some cause: there was nothing to
   occasion them in himself, it must therefore be for our sins: 1 Peter
   iii. 18, For Christ hath also once suffered for sin, the just for the
   unjust, that he might bring us to God.' It was for sins he suffered,
   and therefore certainly for ours, for he had none of his own. Urge it
   then upon your hearts, both as an encouragement to faith and an
   endearment to love. It was a pure Christ that suffered, and therefore
   certainly for such an impure wretch as I am the just for the unjust.
   Reason thus: Surely God is just; Christ undergoing so great sufferings,
   and yet possessed of great purity, certainly died for great sinners.

   2. As a pattern of providence. God meant to copy out all dispensations
   in the life of Christ. Learn then:--

   [1.] That we must not always look upon the face of providence and eye
   present appearances. He made his grave with the wicked, and with the
   rich in his death.' A man would have thought that Christ should have
   had an ignominious burial, and that none would have contributed to his
   glory; but the rich man begged his body from the cross, and God turns
   his grave into his glory. Oh, do not look to present appearance; you
   know not what a mercy may be couched under the frowns of providence.
   John ii. 7, Christ calleth for water-pots when he meant to give them
   wine; and John xi. 6, when he meant to restore Lazarus from the dead by
   a miracle, he would not vouchsafe to go and see him; he abode still two
   days in the same place. When God designed to honour Christ with a
   funeral, he meant to order it so that the Jews looked for nothing else
   but the burial of an ass. Thus God many times seems to hide himself,
   and when we seek for him, he is not to be found: Eccles. xi. 4, He that
   observeth the wind shall not sow, and he that regardeth the clouds
   shall not reap.' If you look always upon the face of outward things,
   the heart will be discouraged with the louring of Providence.

   [2.] Learn what reason you have to wait upon God when things are at the
   worst. There was no appearance for Christ till things came to the
   worst. Joseph begged his body when dead upon the cross: He was with the
   rich in his death;' Job xiii. 15, Though he slay me, yet will I trust
   in him.' God can of a sudden turn things, and disappoint the devices
   and counsels of wicked men, even when they think all is sure. Therefore
   wait upon God, and see what event he will give to things. When the Jews
   thought every one would be ashamed of Christ, up start Joseph and
   Nicodemus, and boldly begged his body. There was death first before God
   would do him honour.

   3. Look upon him as the great example; so there is benefit in the last
   clause: For he had done no violence, neither was there deceit in his
   mouth.' This is your pattern: 1 Peter ii. 21, 22, Because Christ also
   suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow his steps,
   who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.' Oh that we could
   write after this fair copy that Christ hath set us, that we might be
   holy as he was holy in all manner of conversation,' 1 Peter i. 15, in
   every turning of our lives. I would not that you should lose the
   benefit of this instruction for want of making it particular. I shall
   set home this pattern by the two words of the text, violence and
   deceit. None of this was found in Christ.

   [1.] Violence. Take heed of that. There is violence in the spirit,
   manifested by wrath, revenge, boisterousness of passion, affection. Oh,
   what an unbecoming thing is it for men to deliver themselves over to
   the sway of their own passions! James i. 20, The wrath of man worketh
   not the righteousness of God.' The meaning is, such a heart is not fit
   to serve God; it will not reach righteousness. God must have always
   service proportionate. God, that is a spirit, must be served in spirit
   and in truth; the God of peace with peace, with a peaceable, calm
   spirit: 1 Tim. ii. 8, Lifting up holy hands without wrath and
   doubting.' Then there is violence in the tongue, showed in bitterness,
   reviling, reproaches. This was far from Christ; he did no violence.
   This becometh the sons of the world rather than the sons of God. Surely
   such wolfish dispositions do ill become them that are related to the
   Lamb, the Lamb slain for the sins of the world. Where is your warrant
   for this in the life of Christ? Gal. v. 15, If ye bite and devour one
   another, take heed ye be not consumed one of another.' You learn it of
   the wolf or the old dragon, not of the Lamb. The apostle useth such a
   word as implieth such bitterness as is brutish. Then in practice, by
   oppression, invading of another's right and property. There was no such
   thing in Christ. He would not intrench upon the magistrate's office:
   John viii. 11, Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.' Not in
   respect of guilt, for he saith, Sin no more.' But the meaning is, he
   would not meddle with her punishment; it was none of his office, and
   therefore he would not in the least manner encroach upon another's
   right. Learn of Christ, who did no violence.

   [2.] There was no deceit found in his mouth. Take heed also of that. Be
   like Christ. It is said of Nathanael, John i. 47, Behold an Israelite
   indeed, in whom there is no guile.' Why an Israelite indeed? Because,
   like old Israel, like old Jacob; for it is said of him, Gen. xxv. 27,
   Jacob was a plain man, and dwelt in tents.' So here; we are Christians
   indeed when without guile, when we are like Christ, for no deceit was
   found in him. There is deceit in heart, which the scripture calleth
   guile of spirit: Ps. xxxii. 2, Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord
   imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.' Take
   heed of this deceitful heart. We must take heed we drive not on a
   self-design in all our respects to God and men; and when we pretend to
   zeal in worship, that it is not to serve ourselves of it. Rev. xiv. 5,
   it is said of the Lamb's followers, that in their mouth was found no
   guile;' they are without fault before the throne of God, Heb. iv. 12.
   Wait upon the word, for that is a divider between soul and spirit, and
   of the joints and mar row, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
   intention of the heart;' that is, between fairness of pretences, and
   vileness of affection and baseness of intents. And there is deceit in
   the mouth when men dissemble for advantage. You did not learn this of
   Jesus Christ. As Doeg glavered upon David, to tell Saul of it: Ps.
   cxx.3, What shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?' Though he told
   the truth, yet he flattered with David, that he might observe his
   carriage, and relate it to Saul: Ps. lii. 4, Thou lovest all devouring
   words, O thou deceitful tongue.' Then for practice, many give out
   specious pretences, as if they were what indeed they are not. Be what
   you would be accounted to be. It is hypocrisy that overacts to the
   world. We know counterfeit gold because it looketh so yellow: 2 Sam.
   xv. 6, Absalom stole hearts of the men of Israel by flattery, and fair
   but false pretences. But we should eye our pattern. That is true
   religion, to imitate him whom we worship.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE TENTH VERSE.

   Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when
   thou shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he
   shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
   his hand.

   THE prophet is still dealing with the Jews' scandals. Unbelief will
   easily take up any pretence to justify itself. And therefore when there
   was so much ground for their prejudice against Christ, as such meanness
   and so many sufferings, these vain pleas could not easily be removed
   out of their minds; and that is the reason why he speaketh to it again
   in this verse, that he might further discover their folly, because they
   would suffer their thoughts to stay in the outward appearance of
   things, not considering how God bringeth about many times his greatest
   designs in a riddle and mystery, and wraps up the good and salvation of
   his people under a veil of contradictions. God the Father is the
   wronged party, and he that hath to do with pardon: Rom. iii. 26, He is
   the justifier of them that believe in Jesus.' The prophet telleth them
   in this verse that Christ should live by dying, gain by his bruises and
   sufferings;. that which was likely to disaffect the world against him,
   should draw them into his obedience. Where the work of the Lord seemed
   to miscarry, there it should prosper in his hands. The great
   expectation was that the Lord should bruise the head of the serpent;
   yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Christ. Look to the design of God,
   and you shall see sufferings are not matter of scandal, but admiration.
   It is no good rule to measure the in tents of God by the looks and face
   of things. Whilst you look only to the outward meanness and sufferings
   of Christ, you overlook the design of God in him. It pleased the Lord
   to bruise him; he hath put him to grief,' &c. The words contain divers
   arguments and defences against the scandals taken up against Christ by
   the Jews.

   1. The will of God: it pleased the Lord to bruise him, he hath put him
   to grief; that is the cause of his sufferings.

   2. The nature of his suffering: when thou shalt make his soul an
   offering for sin.

   3. The fruits of his suffering, and they are three:--

   [1.] The propagation of his spiritual seed: he shall see his seed.

   !2.] The prolongation of his life: he shall prolong his days.

   [3.] The promulgation of the will of God in his hands: the pleasure of
   the Lord shall prosper in his hands. This will be clear to you by going
   over the phrases.

   Tremellius has it, Delectatus est Dominus, the Lord delighted to bruise
   him. The Seventy, to mend the harshness of the phrase, render it, It
   pleased the Lord to cleanse him;' but that is a mistake of the word,
   which among the Chaldees signifieth to cleanse; and there is no reason
   why we should fear to say that the Lord designed to subject his Son to
   bruisings and to grief, since the great comfort of Christians dependeth
   upon it. That these things did not happen by chance, or against the
   will of God, as something that he did not care for, or would abhor. The
   Lord's pleasure was fulfilled in all these sufferings, though these
   wicked men that brought them upon Christ had other intentions. And that
   decision of Lombard and other school men is very derogatory to the
   truth of the gospel and the comfort of believers, when they say, God
   would only discover the virtues of Christ, and the fruits of his
   sufferings, and the malice of the Jews; as if the sufferings of Christ
   were beside God's intention and design. But the acts of their malice
   are ascribed to the ordination of God: It pleased the Lord to bruise
   him and to put him to grief.' And suit able to this, it is very
   observable in the New Testament, that those words which imply their
   malice do also imply God's appointment. Pilate delivered him, Judas
   delivered him, and God delivered him: Mat. xxvii. 2, pare'doken, And
   delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.' And then it is said of
   Pilate, in the 26th verse, that he loosed or released Barabbas,'
   pare'doken, and delivered Christ to be crucified. And Judas delivered
   him: Mat. xxvi. 15, I will deliver him to you.' And Christ, speaking of
   Judas, says, John xix. 11, Therefore he that delivered me unto thee
   hath the greater sin.' And the same word is used of God's disposal of
   Christ, Rom. viii. 32, He spared not his own Son, but delivered him up
   for us all.' And again, of the Jews, Acts iii. 13, pare'dokkate, Whom
   ye delivered up.' The priests for envy, Judas for gain, the people in
   blind zeal, and Pilate to keep up his esteem among the Jews, but God to
   make out his own ends for the salvation of his people. And always
   delivered or betrayed is expressed by the same word, which is the
   rather to be noted, because the scriptures, riot in one place only, but
   in many, use the same action and expression. And therefore, without any
   stain or blot upon divine justice, we may say, The Lord delighted to
   bruise him and to put him to grief;' for he had a great hand in all
   that was done to Christ. It followeth:--

   When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin;' or, as it is more
   properly in the margin, When his soul shall make an offering for sin:
   this clause being to be referred to God the Son; for the Lord Christ
   was not unwillingly subjected to bruises and griefs, but voluntarily
   submitted himself to the pleasure of his Father's will, and gave
   himself to die for us: Gal. ii. 20, He made his soul (ascham), sin,' as
   it is in the Hebrew, it being a usual property of scripture-phrase to
   call the sin-offering sin. Thus it is said, 2 Cor. v. 21, For he hath
   made him to be sin for us;' that is, a sin-offering. And thus you may
   understand that of the apostle, Rom. viii. 3, God sending his own Son
   in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the
   flesh.' By a sin-offering, which was Christ, he abolished and took away
   sin. I should pass over this phrase, but that I cannot choose but note
   to you the conditionality of this expression, When he shall make his
   soul an offering for sin.' Erab some read it--if thou wilt do thus and
   thus. It implieth the covenant between God and Christ. There is not
   only a covenant between God and believers, but between God and Christ;
   as I shall show more fully hereafter, when I observe the abundant
   usefulness of that consideration. But it followeth in the text:--

   He shall see his seed. This is the third reason why the death of Christ
   should not be accounted infamous and ignominious to him. The meaning
   is, he shall beget to himself a great many children by the immortal
   seed of the word and the power of his Spirit, which are called his
   seed; and it is said he shall see them, he shall live to see how the
   word is propagated throughout all ages. I conceive in this expression
   the prophet alludeth to the desire of the Hebrew fathers, who were for
   living so long as they might see a numerous issue come from their
   loins. And therefore it is spoken of as a very desirable blessing: Ps.
   cxxviii. 6, Thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
   Israel.' Or, if you will, this expression may refer to Isaac, who,
   though God commanded to be offered, yet he promised that his seed
   should be multiplied as the stars of heaven and the sand on the
   sea-shore;' and all this upon his death. That which seemed to cut off
   other men's hopes should increase Christ's. As he saith himself, John
   xii. 24, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
   abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.' So Christ
   by his death, like the root in the ground, perisheth, that he may bring
   forth fruit. But it is added:--

   He shall prolong his days; that is, he shall live for ever. Some refer
   it to his seed,--he shall prolong the days of his seed: so the Seventy.
   But probably it is to be referred to Christ, though the comfort also
   belongeth to the faithful; their days shall be prolonged in the life of
   Christ, and they shall be eternal in his eternity.

   The pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands; that is, the will
   of the Lord. The will of the Lord for your redemption, justification,
   sanctification, the conversion of the world, the collection of a
   church, whatever you may call the will of God. Any design of his shall
   prosper in the hand of Christ; anything in the grand design of
   reconciliation; that is, by his strength, or by his ministry and
   dispensation: both these are called a hand in scripture; as it is said,
   Num. xxxvi. 13, God published the law by the hand of Moses; These are
   the commandments and judgments which the Lord commanded by the hand of
   Moses unto the children of Israel.' So prosper in his hand;' that is,
   by his ministry and dispensation.

   Thus I have gone through the phrases. I have been the larger, because I
   shall a little stay upon this text. I do not find a verse in the
   scriptures that doth yield more consolation and comfort to Christians
   than this doth. Here is the Father's ordination, the Son's voluntary
   susception, God's covenant with Christ; Christ is a sacrifice for sin.
   Here is the promulgation of the gospel, the life of Christ, and the
   pleasure of the Lord. Oh, what a heap of sweetness is here, if we had
   the skill to draw out the comfort of it!

   I begin with the first: Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath
   put him to grief.' The point is, that all the sufferings of Jesus
   Christ were laid on him by the ordination and appointment of God the
   Father.

   It was the Lord bruised him, and put him to grief; that is, it was by
   the Lord's appointment and decree. This appears by scripture, which
   asserts--

   1. The choice of Christ's person, and the designation and deputation of
   him to the office of Mediator. As Isa. xlii. 1, Behold my servant whom
   I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my Spirit
   upon him.' God would show election in Christ first: the cause of his
   appearing in our salvation was God's choice: John vi. 27, Him hath God
   the Father sealed;' that is, expressly appointed, marked out for such a
   design. So it is set forth, Rom. iii. 25, Whom God hath set forth to be
   a propitiation for our sins.' So 1 Peter i. 20, Who verily was
   fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in
   these last times for you.' The plot of the gospel was long since drawn
   in heaven, and lay hid in God's breast, till he was pleased to copy out
   his eternal thoughts, and give the world a draught of them.

   2. The bestowing the person of Christ upon us, so that he was made
   ours, as it were; which is expressed in scripture by God's sending his
   Son: John iii. 16, God so loved the world that he gave his
   only-begotten Son.' He disposed of his person, to be handled so as
   might make most for your good. And, therefore, in other places he is
   said to send his Son: 1 John iv. 10, He sent his Son to be the
   propitiation for our sins.' God despatched him on that great errand.
   And in this sense is the apostle's phrase, Rom. viii. 32, He spared not
   his own Son.' He would not dismiss him from serving his design, though
   it rendered him liable to wrath and sufferings. Gave, sent, would not
   spare; all these words imply the execution of the decree according to
   the design of God.

   3. The determining of all the sufferings of Christ; not a sorrow, but
   God had it in his thoughts before all worlds. Every bruise and stroke
   was a further discovery of his eternal counsel: Acts ii. 23, Him, being
   delivered by the determinate counsel and fore-knowledge of God, ye have
   taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.' Mark it,
   horismene boule kai prognosei. There was an express counsel for that,
   even the greatest mischief their wickedness could execute upon Christ;
   they had other thoughts than to conform to God's will, yet they did but
   discover it, and draw it out to the world: Luke xxii. 22, The Son of
   man goeth as it was determined.' Which checketh our laziness, that we
   do no more consider the several actions of Christ, they being all
   appointed and ordered in much counsel by the Father: Acts iv. 27, 28,
   Of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both
   Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,
   were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
   determined before to be done.' What Herod and the Jews, and Pontius
   Pilate and the Gentiles did, was all that God would have to be done.
   Every particular was conceived and devised in the decree of God, and so
   necessary to be fulfilled; For who hath resisted his will?' Rom. ix.
   19. God will cause the decree to bring forth, and the world shall see
   what is conceived in the womb of his counsels.

   4. There are some expressions which seem to imply as if there were more
   than a bare knowledge and permission in this great affair, as if there
   were some kind of action in Christ's sufferings. As here, It pleased
   the Lord to bruise him, and to put him to grief;' Zech. xiii. 7, Awake,
   O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow,
   saith the Lord of hosts; smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be
   scattered.' God is said to awake and stir up the sword against Christ,
   which implieth more than a bare suffering, some kind of efficiency and
   concurrent act of God to the bruising and grief of Christ. For that
   place is meant of Christ, my shepherd and my fellow; there is no
   shepherd that is God's fellow but Christ. Besides, Christ applieth it
   to himself: Mat. xxvi. 31, For it is written, I will smite the
   shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.' It will be
   worthy the inquiring, then, what acts of God, what efficiency there was
   from him towards the sufferings of Christ?

   1. Thus far God concurred, by a withdrawing of his presence and the
   sight of his favour; so God might be said to put him to grief indeed,
   for so Christ complaineth, Mat. xxvii. 46, My God, my God, why hast
   thou forsaken me?' That was the greatest torment that could be upon
   Christ's spirit. His humanity would not have been sensible of all the
   other sorrows, if there were not a suspension of that joy and comfort
   which otherwise he might have taken in the union of the Godhead. I say,
   in this sense God may be said to put him to grief, by the withdrawing
   of his love and presence of grace from his apprehension.

   2. By sustaining the wicked instruments in their natures, beings, and
   actings, whilst they were drawing out their spite and violence against
   Christ: Acts xvii. 28, In him we live, and move, and have our beings.'
   It is by his concurrence the action is brought forth. God could have
   blasted the hand of violence, blown them all into nothing, even in the
   heat of their fury against his Son; but the Lord upheld them in their
   beings and actings. As Christ said to Pilate, John xix. 11, Thou
   couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from
   above.' If there were not some leave and concession from heaven, they
   could do nothing. God can suspend the actions of the creature at his
   pleasure, as he did the fire from burning when the three children were
   in it. And therefore so far God concurred to the supporting of the
   creature in acts of violence and sin against Christ: men have not a
   power of themselves, separate from a providential assistance, to
   operate or exercise any power in them. Though God doth not take away
   their power, yet if he doth not co operate with their power, nothing
   will be done; as the beasts stood still when the wheels stood still,
   Ezek. i. 21. When God stands still, all second causes are silent, and
   move not at that time. And though he does not dissolve their beings, he
   can suspend their motion, if he will not work with them. There is his
   concurrence to the action, though not to the pravity and wickedness of
   it. I conceive that is dangerous and unsafe to say.

   3. By serving his love and glory by their wickedness, that bruised and
   afflicted Christ. God would not have permitted it if he did not know
   how to make good use of it, and how he might reduce it by his goodness
   and wisdom to his glory. So far he would uphold them in their actings
   as to serve his purposes of salvation, and to cause his pleasure to
   prosper. It pleased the Lord to bruise Christ, that he might bruise the
   serpent. His aim was at his head, though Christ's heel was bruised in
   the enterprise: Gen. iii. 15, It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
   bruise his heel.' God doth make sin itself to turn to his own glory. As
   Gregory said of Adam's fall, it was foelix culpa, because it made way
   for such a Redeemer as Christ, because it made way for his redemption;
   as the apostle said, Rom. iii. 5, Our unrighteousness commendeth the
   righteousness of God.' And such efficiency there was about evil, though
   not of evil, that God might bring good out of it, and dispose of it for
   the advantage of his own counsels and intents. And so he may be said to
   awake the sword against the shepherd that was his fellow, as justly
   pursuing the effect of his own decrees.

   The reasons of this point are:--

   1. Because all things fall under his decrees and the care of his
   providence, and therefore certainly this matter of Christ does. See
   that place, Eph. i. 11, he worketh all things after the counsel of his
   own will;' the meaning is, there is nothing done in the world but God
   may be said to work it; he doth it by counsel and by the counsel of his
   own will, in a wise order and freely, as God pleaseth and as he seeth
   best. God's will and counsel is the ground of all things. Mark the
   generality of the expression, all things; nothing so low and frivolous
   but God's will taketh cognisance of it; nothing so wicked but God will
   order and dispose it for good: Mat. x. 29, Not a sparrow shall fall
   upon the ground without your Father; and every hair of your head is
   numbered.' Nothing so sinful as Judas's act and Pilate's, yet it was
   determined; God's hand and counsel intended it. Whatever is done is
   done in reference to some foregoing decree.

   2. Because this was the special design and contrivance of heaven to
   bring forth Christ into the world; all other dispensations looked this
   way. Adam's fall, God's providence through so many ages, did but tend
   to help on this great birth, and therefore this design of Christ is
   called by the apostle, Eph. iii. 10, The manifold wisdom of God.' All
   that variety and intermixture of providences was but in pursuance of
   his design: 1 Tim. iii. 16, Without controversy great is the mystery of
   godliness, God manifest in the flesh.' This was the great contrivance,
   the masterpiece of heaven, that discovered most of God to the
   creatures. It was much when God made man after his own image and
   likeness, the wonder of nature; yet it was more when God made himself
   after our image. That is a wonder indeed. The apostle would have it
   carried above all exception by all Christians. Therefore, it was
   especially in heaven designed by God.

   Object. How is the creature to blame, then, for smiting and bruising of
   Christ? Or if to blame, how is God clear? It was by his ordination and
   appointment.

   Ans. 1. For the creatures' blame; they are faulty:--

   [1.] Because God's secret thoughts and intents are not their rule.
   Hidden things belong to God; and it is he that worketh according to the
   counsel of his own will. You must look to the counsel of his word.
   Though God got a great deal of glory, yet that was no thanks to them
   that crucified Christ; for because they crucified him, the wrath of God
   came upon them to the uttermost, to their ruin and desolation, 1 Thes.
   ii. 16.

   [2.] They had other ends, though God turned it for good: Acts ii., With
   wicked hands ye have taken, and crucified, and slain;' Isa. x. 7,
   Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is
   in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few,' Judas's end was
   gain, Pilate's to please the people, the high priests' to wreak their
   malice; but God had other ends in it, the salvation of fallen man.

   [3.] God's decrees did not compel them to evil; it implieth things will
   be, though it doth not effect them--there is no necessity of constraint
   and compulsion, though there be of infallibility. God taketh not
   liberty from the creatures, nor contingency from the second causes;
   they act their own way, though God turneth it to his own ends; they
   were carried to it by their wickedness. This is the plain decision of
   the matter.

   2. For the justifying of God when he judgeth. His justice cannot be
   impeached, because he infuseth no evil, enforceth to no evil, only
   ordaineth what shall be; his goodness cannot be impeached for suffering
   things which he can turn to such advantage for his own glory and the
   creature's good. And, therefore, as the sun shineth upon a dung hill
   without having his beams polluted by it, so God's ordination taketh in
   the sin of the creatures without any blemish to itself. God's decrees
   are immanent in himself, working nothing that is evil in the creatures.
   Other things might be said, but I would not perplex the matter.

APPLICATION.

   Use 1. It serveth to give check to curiosity. Men are bold in their
   inquiries, and cavil at such dispensations. Though you cannot see the
   reason of them, yet rest in God's appointment: It pleased the Father to
   bruise him.' You shall find in scripture this is made to be the last
   result of all difficulty, the pleasure and will of God: Col. i. 19, It
   pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.' If you would
   know the reason why the second person should be chosen, and enriched
   with the fulness of the Godhead, it pleased the Father. So for God's
   liberty in dispensing mercies to babes, passing by wise men: Mat. xi.
   26, Even so, Father, because it pleaseth thee.'

   Use 2. Is consolation to believers. Here is ample encouragement for
   your faith: every grain in the life of Christ should be weighed. Now
   this is a material consideration, that he was ordained by God the
   Father.

   1. That the offended party beginneth first to think of a remedy: 1 John
   iv. 19, He loved us first.' Certainly it is a great relief and support
   to our thoughts; God thinketh of a pardon before we could think of the
   sin. It pleased the Father to take the sufferings of Christ into his
   eternal thoughts. Oh, then, when you have offended the Father, think
   you have a Christ to present to him, one that he thought of before all
   worlds.

   2. Here is encouragement. Christ is a sacrifice of the Father's
   ordaining. He was pleased to bruise him. Therefore, rejoice and triumph
   in believing. You have found him who is acceptable to God the Father.
   This is the great inquiry of men, how to appease God. When they are
   filled with fears, and a sense of divine wrath, what would they give to
   redeem their souls from guilt? You shall see the offers of the creature
   are very large: Micah vi. 6, 7, Wherewith shall I come before the Lord,
   and bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him with
   burnt-offerings and calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with
   thousands of rams, and ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my
   first-born for my transgression, and the fruit of my body for the sin
   of my soul?' Thus, you see, they bid high. Oh, this will be your
   disposition when you are scorched with God's wrath. Anything for a
   pardon, for a testimony of his love. How shall you please him? Though
   he will not accept of thy first-born, yet he will of his own Son, whom
   himself hath given thee. It is not the creature's shift, but the Lord's
   appointment. You may be sure here is somewhat will please the Father;
   you have it from heaven: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased.' But God will have all believers know it. Oh, say with joy
   then, Job xxxiii. 20, I have found a ransom.' God will say so too: it
   was his ordination for reconciliation.

   3. Here is comfort against sins of deliberation. It may be you have
   catered for your lusts, and devised wickedness upon your beds. It is
   sad when so much of your hearts hath gone out to the ways of sin. Sins
   of counsel and premeditation do most sadly wound the Spirit; but here
   is your balm and comfort. Christ was the result of God's eternal
   thoughts. The Lord was devising the remedy as well as we the sin.

   Use 3. Is information. It informeth us of divers things.

   1. The greatness of God's love: John iii. 16, God so loved the world,
   that he gave his only-begotten Son.' Christ himself speaketh of it with
   admiration. So loved! as if there were not an expression great enough
   to show how much: 1 John iv. 10, Herein is love, not that we loved God,
   but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our
   sins.' If you speak of love, this is love indeed. When Abraham offered
   Isaac, and would part with his son, how doth the Lord make him promises
   upon it? Oh, then, consider what it was for God, of all persons, to
   choose the second person in the Godhead, his Son, and to give him up
   for you--to determine so great sufferings against him, to awaken the
   sword against the shepherd his fellow--and all for your sakes. Consider
   of it in your thoughts, and let these thoughts of God be sweet and
   endearing to you. He was not bound to it; you could oblige him by no
   merits, by no satisfaction you could make him,--only it pleased him.
   Oh, study this his love, the dying love of our dear Redeemer.

   2. The ancientness of God's love in Christ. The oldness of love is the
   commendation of it; therefore God saith, Isa. liv. 8, With an
   everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee.' His pleasure in Christ
   was conceived before all worlds. Christ manifested in time was the
   effect of an eternal love. You shall see the scriptures voucheth the
   ancientness of the promise often: Titus i. 2, In hope of eternal life,
   which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began.' A promise
   that went before all time.

   3. It teacheth us to bless God the Father for giving and appointing of
   Jesus Christ. It is good to look what endearment every person hath upon
   our spirits, that so we may keep them up in our thoughts as a
   proportioned object for our worship and respects. Here is the great
   endearment:--The election of the Father caused the donation of the Son:
   Eph. i. 3, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
   hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.'
   Bless him not only as your creator and preserver, but as the God and
   Father of Christ.

   4. It teacheth us not to look upon the face of things, but upon God's
   counsel and intents in them. The foulest acts that ever were in God's
   design may serve most holy purposes. Providence is like a double-faced
   picture--a monster and a woman: Gen. xlv. 5, God sent me before you to
   preserve life.' So in all that befalleth you, or what others do to you
   out of ill ends, God may work good out of it.

   I come now to the second argument--why Christ's death should not be
   looked upon as infamous and ignominious to him; and that is taken from
   the manner of his sufferings: When thou shalt make his soul an offering
   for sin;' or When his soul shall make an offering for sin.' I shall
   take notice--

   1. Of the form or manner of it.

   2. The matter, or what is contained in it.

   1. For the form or manner of it. It seemeth to be conditional and
   federal, that when Christ would do thus and thus, God would perform his
   part to him, and he should enjoy such and such privileges. The point
   is--

   Doct. That the business of man's salvation was transacted by way of
   covenant between God and Christ.

   Here is the form of it, that in case Christ would make his soul an
   offering for sin, he should see his seed, and prolong his days, and the
   pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hands. That this point may
   be fully made out to you, I shall use this method:--

   1. Show how it may appear that there was such a covenant and formality
   of agreement between God and Christ.

   2. What this covenant is, and the several ways whereby it doth appear
   in scripture.

   1. I shall show how it may appear there was such a covenant.

   [1.] By such titles given to Christ as do infer it, because he is the
   effect or result of it; as Mal. iii. 1, I will send the angel (or
   messenger) of the covenant, even the messenger of the covenant whom ye
   delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.' This him
   whom by covenant I have designed to such an office, him whom by virtue
   of the compact and agreement I have made with him, I shall send to you.
   So you shall see he is called a covenant: Isa. xlii. 6, And give thee
   for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;' Isa. xlix.
   8, And give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth.'
   Because of the eternal agreement between God and Christ, he is said to
   be a covenant; that is, the foundation of a covenant between God and
   believers. His being given for a covenant, is to be a means to redeem
   and reconcile them.

   [2.] By the words that passed between God and Christ, that are recorded
   in scripture. It is very observable that the scripture, for the
   relieving of our thoughts and apprehensions, does make all the passages
   and debates between God and Christ to pass by words: so in this
   business: Ps. cx., Thou art my Son, sit thou at my right hand;' Ps. ii.
   8, Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,
   and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.' But to this
   affair in hand, you shall see how God breaketh the matter to him: Ps.
   lxxxix. 19, Thou spakest in vision to the Holy One, and saidst, I have
   laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of
   the people.' Thou speakest in a mystical way to thy Christ; God
   revealeth himself to his Holy One, and said thus, Lo, the creatures are
   weak and miserable, never able to recover themselves into my favour,
   but thou art mighty; therefore I shall lay this charge upon you, to
   help them. And thereupon you shall see Christ's answer: Ps. xl. 7, 8,
   Lo, I come; in the volume of thy book it is written of me, I delight to
   do thy will, O my God.' Christ accepted of it, and agreed to the terms,
   and was willing to do, and conform to the pleasure of God the Father
   for poor sinners. So in this place, if he will do thus and thus, then
   he shall see his seed, and prolong his days, and the pleasure of the
   Lord shall prosper in his hands.

   [3.] It appeareth by the carriage of Christ. The scripture showeth
   everywhere that it was according to the covenant God made with him: he
   undertook to do all things according to the will of the Father: John
   iv. 34, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish
   his work;' and therefore he would punctually keep to the laws of the
   covenant. And accordingly he is said to look up to God the Father for
   the accomplishment of his promise to him: John x. 18, This commandment
   I received of my Father, that I should lay down my life: I have agreed
   to it. John xii. 49, For I have not spoken of myself, but the Father
   that sent me, he gave me a commandment what I should say, and what I
   should speak: according to the instructions he received from God, and
   the tenor of his commission; he would not vary from it a tittle. And he
   goeth to the Father, and urgeth it to him: John xvii. 4, I have
   glorified thee upon earth, and have finished the work which thou gavest
   me to do.' He did all that he was bound to do. So in many other places.

   2. What this covenant is. I shall here show you the whole draught of
   this transaction. To a covenant there belong four things--two on the
   part of the proposer, and two on the part of the undertaker; and so in
   this covenant you will find the scriptures fully discovering these four
   things--two on God's part, and two on Christ's. On God's part, there is
   the work proposed and the encouragements promised. And then, on
   Christ's part, the work is undertaken, and the terms and promises
   expected to be fulfilled.

   [1.] To begin with that which is God the Father's part, who being the
   first in order of persons, is the first covenanter. In the motioning of
   a thing, something is required and something promised.

   (1.) See what is required then, and what charge is given to Christ.
   Help is laid upon the shoulders of Christ. It may be referred to two
   heads:--

   (1st) He was to do something by way of merit and impetration, that so
   he might satisfy the creatures' engagement, and merit the favour of God
   for them, which they had forfeited; and there were divers steps in
   this. He was to divest himself of his glory, to strip himself of all
   appearances of the Godhead. And therefore he is said to he employed as
   an instrument and servant in the execution of God's decrees. Hence it
   is said, Isa. liii. 2, He shall grow up before him as a tender plant,
   and as a root out of a dry ground, having no form nor comeliness.'
   Before him; that is, before God the Father: ver. 11, By his knowledge
   shall my righteous servant justify many:' Isa. xlii. 1, Behold my
   servant, whom I uphold.' To this end he was to take a body: Heb. x. 5,
   A body hast thou prepared me.' And to take flesh of a woman; and
   therefore it is said, Gal. iv. 4, God sent forth his Son, made of a
   woman, made under the law.' He was to take an office of service and
   obedience, and then to work all our works for us. It is said he was
   made under the law, subjected to the first covenant of works. He was to
   be holy, and harmless, and undefiled, to be exercised with divers
   sufferings, reproaches, and injuries; therefore called a man of
   sorrows,' Isa. liii. 3. And it became God in this regard to make the
   captain of our salvation perfect through sufferings. Then at length to
   humble himself to the very death, and in great consternation and
   agonies to lay down his life, and to pour out his soul as an offering
   for sin: and all by the command of the Father; that is, by the charge
   laid upon him by God. And thus far the merit. He left his glory, taking
   our nature, our works, our debts upon himself, and subjected himself to
   the wrath of God the Father, that he might make an atonement for the
   sins of the world, sufficient for all mankind.

   (2dly.) God gave him something touching the application of his merit.
   God gave in the names of divers persons, and bade him have a care over
   them. Therefore it is said, John x. 3, He calleth his own sheep by
   name.' He hath such a special care over them, as if every distinct name
   were given unto him, and there were a charge committed to him to have a
   care of that soul. And the elect of the Father are said to be given to
   Christ: John xvii. 6, Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.' Now
   what was he to do to them, i.e., to those of the world whom God had
   chosen as his? He was to enlighten them; he was to bring them into
   covenant with himself by enlightening them. God saith of Christ, Isa.
   xlii. 6, I will give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light to
   the Gentiles;' that is, to shine in upon them in the darkness of their
   natural estate, to bring them home to himself: John vi. 37, All that
   the Father giveth me shall come to me: and them that come to me I will
   in no wise cast out.' And the reason is given in the next verse; it is
   the will of my Father.' And then he was to comfort them by the glad
   tidings of salvation: Isa. lxi. 1, The Lord hath anointed me to preach
   good tidings to the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the
   broken-hearted, to proclaim comfort to all that mourn, to proclaim
   liberty to the captives, and the opening the prison to them that are
   bound.' And after this to bear with their weakness and waywardness; for
   that is a part of his charge: Isa. xlii. 3, A bruised reed shall he not
   break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.' Lovingly to bear with
   the ignorance and weaknesses of his children, and supply all their
   defects by his Spirit and strength: Isa, xl. 11, He shall feed his
   flock like a shepherd; he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and
   carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.' He
   shall have a special and certain care of his tender flock. Besides,
   where they want strength, he shall lend his own strength, and so
   sweetly lead and guide them by his counsel, till he has brought them to
   his glory, that is in his commission and charge: John vi. 40, And this
   is the will of him that sent me, that every one that seeth the Son, and
   believeth on him, may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at
   the last day.' This is the Father's charge, who doth as it were say
   thus to his Son, If you will engage yourself to me, here is the work
   you are to do; you must leave your glory and become my servant; I have
   fitted a body for you, and you shall fulfil the law, and live in
   meanness and misery, and then yield up yourself to an accursed death,
   that so you may merit my favour for these persons whose names I give
   you: and then you shall oblige yourself to enlighten and quicken them
   by your Spirit, that their bondage may be removed: and then you shall
   cherish them, and comfort them, and support them, especially the weak
   ones among them, until you have perfected them, and brought them to
   glory. This is the sum, and this was the will of the Father, and the
   charge given to Christ: so that whatsoever Christ acted as Mediator, he
   acteth as God's servant.

   2. Now, the work being proposed, God promiseth what he should expect by
   way of encouragement and reward for it; and that is this, that in case
   Christ will undertake all this, he shall not want help, he shall have
   the Spirit: Isa. lxi. 1, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me;' and that
   he should have the Spirit without measure, not by drops, as the
   creatures have. And that he should have all countenance; God would not
   forget his relation in the meanness of his disguise: I will be to him a
   Father, and he shall be to me a Son,' Heb. i. 5. And because empty
   relations are nothing worth, God would not only be a Father in title,
   but dispense all fatherly care and respects to him, so that though he
   meet with opposition and discouragements, he should be borne up against
   the brunt of them: Isa. xlii. 4, He shall not fail nor be discouraged,
   till he have set judgment in the earth, and the isles shall wait for
   his law.' He shall still have the best. His judgments and law shall be
   set up; and sorry, impotent men shall but express their malice; they
   shall not wreak and satisfy it, for the Lord will be with him: Isa.
   xlii. 4, He shall not fail nor be discouraged;' the meaning is, he will
   mightily come in for his assistance. And then, after all this, he shall
   be full of success and triumph: He shall see his seed,' and God's
   pleasure shall thrive in his hands. He shall have anything, a kingdom
   that knoweth no end and no limits: Ps. ii. 8, Ask of me, and I will
   give thee the heathen for an inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
   the earth for a possession.' He shall have power over his adversaries
   to use them at pleasure, to dash them in pieces as a potter's vessel is
   shattered into pieces by an iron mace. Alas! what is an earthen vessel
   to an iron mace? And then the bowing and stooping of all creatures
   before him: Phil. ii. 9, 10, Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and
   given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus
   every knee should bow.' God hath promised not only to break the
   stoutest back, but to bow the stiffest knee; and wherefore? because he
   undertook this work by covenant. And then, after all this, an entrance
   into glory: Luke xxiv. 26, Ought not Christ to have suffered these
   things, and to enter into glory?' So was he thus engaged to do by
   covenant. And besides, Christ was encouraged by promises not only to
   his person, but for his people. As a sufficiency of grace: Col. i. 19,
   It pleased the Father that in him all fulness should dwell.' And also a
   power to justify them: By his knowledge shall my righteous servant
   justify many.' To sanctify, enlighten, and glorify them: All things are
   delivered me of my Father,' Mat. xi. 27. So that you see what God would
   do for Christ, in case he should take that burden and charge upon him.
   Thus you see the matter proposed by God the Father.

   Secondly, Now you shall see that this is accepted by God the Son; the
   work is undertaken with reference to those terms.

   1. The work is undertaken. God the Son, being equal to the Father,
   could not have been commanded and overruled to any service without a
   voluntary susception and concurrence of his own; and therefore, upon
   this discovery of the will of God, Christ sweetly concurred and
   consented to it: Ps. xl. 7, 8, Lo, I come; in the volume of thy book it
   is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O God.' And he professeth
   in another place, John iv. 34, My meat is to do the will of him that
   sent me, and to finish his work.' It was a gladsome thing to him, as
   the hours of repast are to an ordinary man. As for the impetration, God
   would have him lay aside his glory. And it is said, Phil. ii. 7, And
   made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant,
   and was made in the likeness of men,' incarnate; He was found in
   fashion of a man.' It was his Father's will that he should endure
   reproaches and injuries: Isa. l. 5, 6, The Lord hath opened mine ear,
   and I was not rebellious, neither turned away my back: I gave my back
   to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid
   not my face from shame and spitting.' Christ offered himself to all
   these indignities, being bound to it. He would not be rebellious
   against his Father's motion. Then to do our works; therefore he is said
   to be obedient. And then to pay our debts; and therefore he is said to
   be obedient to the death of the cross, Phil. ii. 7. Then for the
   application of the merit; he inviteth the weary, Mat. xi. 28. He
   enlighteneth the blind, dispossesseth Satan, sets the captive free,
   Mark v. 18. Pitieth the faint: Luke xv. 5, And when he had found it, he
   layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing.' He bringeth home the weary upon
   his own shoulders, and at length bringeth them to glory: John vi. 40,
   And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one that seeth the
   Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life, and I will raise
   him at the last day.'

   2. Christ looketh for the donation, and the accomplishment of God's
   terms upon it. As for help and assistance: Isa. l. 9, Behold, the Lord
   will help me.' So Isa. xlix. 5, And my God shall be my strength.' It is
   spoken of Christ in many places. And Isa. xlix. 7, Thus saith the Lord,
   the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to
   him whom the nations abhor, to a servant of rulers, kings shall see and
   arise, and princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is
   faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.' He
   comforts himself with the promises of success and glory, that though
   the nations should despise it, yet kings should see it, and rulers
   worship him. The apostle, quoting a prophecy of Christ, saith in his
   person, Heb. ii. 13, I will put my trust in him;' that is, for his
   seed; Behold I and the children which God hath given me.' So for his
   people: the Spirit is called the promise of the Father, Luke xxiv. 49,
   And, behold, I send the promise of the Father unto you,' that is, the
   Spirit which my Father hath promised, he will give you. And he pleadeth
   for his own glory upon this ground, because he had submitted to God's
   terms: John xvii. 5, And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own
   self, with the glory I had with thee before the world was.' So for his
   people, ver. 24, Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me
   be with me where I am, and that they may behold my glory which thou
   hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.'
   Thou didst promise this glory to me, and to them in me, in the
   everlasting covenant. And thus I have given you a taste of this matter.

   The reasons are these:--

   First, That God might found another covenant upon it; therefore God
   would make a covenant with his Son before he would make a covenant with
   his creatures; for indeed Christ's covenant is the foundation of
   another covenant. Unless he had been bound to Christ by this, the other
   would not have been sure, if God had not obliged Christ to the
   oversight of it. That this reasoning may be looked upon as the more
   cogent, do but eye the several differences between both these
   covenants.

   1. This was made with Christ; he is the only federate or person in
   covenant with God: but now, in the other, Christ is indeed a main
   federate, the prime federate or chiefest person in covenant, but not
   the only federate. That he is the prime federate is clear: Gal. iii.
   16, To Abraham and his seed were the promises; but he saith not seeds,
   as of many, but to thy seed, as to one, which is Christ;' that is,
   Christ mystical; the whole church, head and members, are called Christ
   in scripture: 1 Cor. xii. 12, For as the body is one, and hath many
   members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one
   body, so also is Christ.' It is true, the promises are mainly pitched
   upon his person, but from him descend to the rest: for the covenant is
   not made with Christ only, as appeareth, Heb. viii. 8, I will make a
   covenant with the house of Israel, and the house of Judah.' It is made
   with all believers. This is made to Christ mystically, whereas the
   other we speak of now is made to Christ personally.

   2. This made with Christ is a covenant of works in the very formality
   of it, and obliged him to subject himself to a covenant of works, to
   fulfil perfect obedience for the creatures, and to satisfy for the
   debts of the creatures, and to buy out their peace by the price of his
   own blood; but now the covenant made with believers is a covenant of
   grace. God dealt with Christ in justice, that he might deal with us in
   mercy: Rom. iii. 24, Being justified freely by his grace, through the
   redemption that is in Jesus Christ.' God dealeth with us freely, though
   he satisfied his justice upon Jesus Christ. The yoke of the old
   covenant is not upon the neck of believers, because the stroke of it is
   Upon the back of Christ.

   3. This covenant made with Christ is eternal, before all worlds; the
   other, the covenant of grace, is made with us in time, and we enter
   into it in time. I confess in itself it is very old, ever since the
   first promise dropped from God's mouth: Gen. iii. 15, The seed of the
   woman shall bruise the serpent's head, and thou shall bruise his heel.'
   Though since that it hath been renewed, and we come to have share in it
   at conversion, yet I say it is very old, ever since the fall; however
   it is not so old as the covenant with Christ, that was before all time:
   Titus i. 2, In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie,
   promised before the world began,' that is, to Jesus Christ. Before any
   succession of time Christ received promises for you, and undertook to
   bestow eternal life upon believers: 2 Tim. i. 9, it is said, According
   to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before
   the world began;' that is, it was given to Christ for us. And this it
   may be is the meaning of that, Heb. xiii. 20, that Jesus Christ is the
   great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting
   covenant;' the blood appointed to be shed to be the everlasting
   covenant between God and him.

   Second reason, That Christ might be inaugurated into his office with
   the more solemnity, and greater endearment to the creatures. That which
   is done by a covenant is done more solemnly and surely; you have not
   only a decree and purpose, and promise and types, but the discovery of
   a covenant: Ps. cx. 4, The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent; thou
   art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.' There you have
   God's oath for Christ's priesthood, which noteth an irreversible
   sentence. Though the creatures play fast and loose with him, yet God
   thinketh himself never enough bound to them. And, therefore, he would
   tie himself in such ways as are most solemn and obliging amongst men,
   as by oaths and covenants. He would fain stablish the hearts of
   sinners, and make things certain to them; and, therefore, he giveth
   this account of his eternal transactions for your good, they were
   ordered by way of covenant.

   Third reason, This is a way that yieldeth mush comfort and satisfaction
   to the people of God. This is the most comfortable representation of
   Jesus Christ that can be made to you, and that for two reasons:--

   1. You have a double engagement upon God; he is engaged to Christ, and
   he is engaged to you. Oh, that is it that makes all sure to our souls,
   that God was engaged to Christ first! If God had only dealt with
   particular persons, the business had been in danger of miscarrying. In
   the covenant of works the burden lay upon every one's person; if thou
   do this, thou shalt live: Gal. iii. 10, Cursed is every one that
   continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law
   to do them.' But now there is a covenant made with Christ: indeed God
   hath taken every one's person into covenant, but God hath given Christ
   the oversight of it; he hath founded a covenant upon a covenant. The
   covenant was made to him before it was made to you. Nay, in the
   covenant made with you, it is made with one seed, which is Christ:
   there to Christ mystical, here to Christ personal; still Christ is
   taken in with you, and therefore the business is more sure and
   satisfying: 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in Christ reconciling the world to
   himself.' There is great comfort that he would transact the matter with
   Christ before he would meddle and deal with the world.

   2. You have double promises; the very promises that are made to
   Christ's person, they are your promises as well as Christ's, so far as
   they are compatible with your state and condition. Your Mediator will
   be nothing but what you shall have the benefit of; nay, it is very
   observable that we have glory not only by virtue of the promises made
   to ourselves, but by virtue of the promises made to Christ; that we
   should have glory, as Christ prays, John xvii. 23, 24, And the glory
   which thou gavest me I have given them. Father, I will that they also
   whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my
   glory which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me from the foundation
   of the world.' God promised to be his God and Father, and therefore you
   may be as confident he will be yours as if the promise had been
   directed to your persons. For Christ reasons thus, John xx. 17, Go to
   my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, to
   my God and your God.' He hath engaged himself to be mine, therefore
   yours; you are what I am. So that besides the promises directed to
   sinners, you have Christ's personal promises so far as they concern
   your state. So you shall see God promised to acquit Christ from all the
   sins he should take upon him, and to free him from the reproaches that
   should be cast upon his person, because of his miserable appearance in
   the world: Isa. l. 7, 8, For the Lord God will help me; therefore I
   shall not be confounded. He is near that justifieth me; who shall
   contend with me?' If all the world count me a sinner, God will justify
   me. As the apostle applieth it to believers, Rom. viii. 33, Who shall
   lay anything to the charge of God's elect? it is God that justifieth.'
   God dealt with Christ as the first believer: if Christ had the Spirit
   put upon him, you shall have the Spirit by virtue of the first promise:
   Isa. xlii. 1, I have put my Spirit upon him; and he shall bring forth
   judgment to the Gentiles.' Isa. xliv. 3, I will pour my Spirit upon thy
   seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.'

   Use 1. Is exhortation by way of inference to two duties:--

   1. If there be such a covenant, meditate upon it. Oh, it is the most
   comfortable subject that you can spend your thoughts upon! Consider the
   form of it, that the divine decrees were laid in the way of a covenant,
   and that God and Christ should article one with another. You may fetch
   a great deal of comfort and support for your faith out of this.

   [1.] It occasioned God and Christ to become both believers, and to
   trust one another; and Christ is a believer to this day: Heb. x. 13,
   From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.' God
   promised Christ, and Christ promised God, and they took each other's
   word for the salvation of all the world. Oh, what an encouragement is
   it to believe when you have such high patterns! If you will not believe
   God upon his oath, believe him upon his engagement to Christ. It is an
   honour to be a believer, because God and Christ were both believers: as
   great personages among men are an honour to the society and fellowship
   into which they come. You may fetch a reason hence; they trusted one
   another, and shall not I trust them both? Now you have a willing God
   and an able Saviour, and they both in covenant with you. Christ would
   not let go the assurance that he had of God's love by this covenant in
   his agonies: Mat. xxvii. 46, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
   me?' Though there were a suspension of the discovery of love, yet he
   could say my God, my God. Oh, why should not we believe now, and
   silence all doubts? Who would not believe God with his surety?

   [2.] Consider the manifold engagements that are upon God. God is bound
   to Christ, and God is bound to you; the heart should not be loose in
   believing when God is thus bound. You have his purpose, his promise,
   his oath, both covenants. Is it not a high affront put upon God to
   distrust him now? God was angry with Sarah for laughing, when she had
   but a bare promise, Gen. xviii. 13. Certainly, then, he has just cause
   to be angry with you for unbelieving, when he hath so deeply engaged
   himself to you. Num. xxiii. 19, it is said, Hath he said, and shall he
   not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?' So I may
   say much more, Hath he not sworn, hath he not covenanted, and will he
   not make good his engagement to Christ?

   [3.] Here is comfort against the sense of our unworthiness: you are
   vile wretches, you can expect nothing; but consider, Christ is not
   unworthy: God made the promises to him; he hath the oversight of the
   covenant of grace: God hath a bond, a covenant with him; and though you
   have given him occasion to break with you, yet he will not break with
   his own Son. Jesus Christ did not fail in his undertaking with God, but
   fulfilled the will of his heavenly Father, even to a tittle. Therefore
   God will make good his word to Jesus Christ for you, though humble and
   vile in yourselves. No matter though you be base in your own eyes;
   consider the truth of God plighted to his Son, who was not unfaithful.

   [4.] Against fears of apostasy. Oh, you shall not keep faithful with
   God! Why, consider God doth not deal first with you as with particular
   persons, but with Jesus Christ. The covenant is not committed to the
   indeterminate freedom of your wills, and the wanderings of your hearts,
   but to the care of Jesus Christ; and there is no breach likely to be on
   Christ's part. It is a dishonour to God to think we are out of favour
   upon every offence. In the state of innocency we had perfect peace, but
   it was such an estate as was capable of enmity, because the covenant
   was made with ourselves; but now it is made with Christ, that is a firm
   foundation. If we were still left to our own free will, it were not
   certain that any should be saved.

   2. The matter of the covenant; this yields ground of comfort also. Do
   but consider what Christ was bound to, or what God promised Christ. Do
   you struggle with unbelief, and you cannot tell how to settle upon any
   comfort? If you belong to Christ, God hath given him a charge to look
   after your souls, you shall not perish; Christ is bound to apply the
   virtue of his sufferings, as well as to merit by them. Are you feeble?
   God hath provided a place for you in Christ's bosom. Christ's shoulders
   are for lambs that cannot go of their own feet. Do you want knowledge?
   It is one of the things given Christ in charge: He shall be a light to
   the Gentiles.' Do you want freedom and liberty towards God? Christ is
   to preach freedom to the captives. Still study the covenant between God
   and Christ, and you shall see the Lord Jesus received a charge to
   supply your wants. Is a nation stubborn and averse from Christ? Is it
   not said, He shall set judgment in the earth, that the isles shall wait
   for his law'? Is there opposition against Christ, his glory, and
   servants? Is it not said, He shall not fail, nor be broken in
   judgment'? Alas! these adversaries can do nothing; like angry bees,
   they may sting, but they leave their life behind them. God will still
   uphold the hand and head of Christ. This is the first part to meditate
   on.

   2. If there were a covenant made with Christ, oh, then, get an interest
   in him, and be united to him, that so you may come within the compass
   of his care and commission. Everything belongeth to you according to
   your interest in Christ: 2 Cor. i. 20, The promises are in him yea, and
   in him amen.' Still a man's hope is in the covenant of grace: and you
   shall see Christ hath all to do in the covenant of grace.

   [1.] In this covenant between God and Christ he is only federate; he
   hath taken the whole business upon himself, to discharge you out of the
   covenant of works, to destroy the powers of hell, to bring you into
   favour with God. We cannot do it with our prayers and tears: Hosea
   xiii. 14, I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem
   them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy
   destruction.' Christ undertook this when God the Father and Christ
   entered into a formal, solemn compact, for so the apostle explaineth
   it, 1 Cor. xv. 55.

   [2.] In the covenant of grace made with believers, Christ is every way
   concerned in it: he taketh several relations upon himself, which seem
   otherwise to be contradistinct.

   (1.) He is called the testator or author of the covenant: Heb. ix. 16,
   For where there is a testament, there must also of necessity be the
   death of the testator.' It was built upon his purchase, confirmed by
   his death. He undertook to make up all controversies that might fall
   out between God and us; and so the whole is ascribed to him; therefore
   he is said to be the author and finisher of our faith,' Heb. xii. 2.
   Our faith is built upon that covenant, and peace with Christ is surely
   ordained for us. We are said to be his people: Mat. i. 21, And he shall
   save his people from their sins.' And therefore there are many promises
   in scripture that pass in the name of Christ. Some what he will do to
   us, which shows him to be joint-author together with God in the
   covenant; he, being heir with his father, is heir to the promises. So
   that you see there is no likelihood of right to the covenant but by
   union with Jesus Christ. It is his covenant as well as the Father's.

   (2.) He is called the Mediator of the covenant: Heb. xii. 24, And to
   Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant.' He is the middle person that
   goeth betwixt God and us, to make up all breaches that may be on our
   default; he mediates with the Father when he is provoked by our sin,
   and mediates with us by his Spirit, to bring us upon our knees before
   God. The old covenant needed no mediator, for God and man were not
   fallen out; but now they are so, and therefore Christ is the fittest
   person to mediate; for partaking of the nature of both parties, he is
   the fittest person to come between them.

   (3.) He is called the surety of the covenant: Heb. vii. 22, By so much
   was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.' One that is to see it
   performed on both sides, so as God will challenge Christ for our part,
   and you may challenge God for Christ's part. He is to see all wrought
   in us which God hath required; to see that the Spirit writes the law in
   our hearts, and inclines us to obedience; and then to see that we yield
   up that obedience, and that God be satisfied. He is to do all our works
   for us, and all our works in us; so that God calleth upon Christ, and
   we call upon Christ. All is done in him, and therefore God calleth him
   his witness, Isa. lv. 4, Ye are my witnesses, and my servant whom I
   have chosen.' Isa. xliii. 10. He is my chief witness, that I am
   faithful, and true, and able. Christ will undertake for him, and he
   will undertake for you, for you need a surety most.

   (4.) In the covenant of grace Christ is the prime federate; the
   promises are mainly pitched upon him, and he receiveth them for all his
   brethren. He is mainly intended: Gen. iii. 15, I will put enmity
   between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. It shall
   bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.' Mark, the covenant is
   made to all in general, but so as it reflects upon Christ especially.
   There is an enmity between all the holy seed and the serpent's, all the
   spawn of Satan, though chiefly Christ be concerned in it, as if the
   whole seed were Christ's. And in the covenant renewed with Abraham, the
   promises are mainly pitched upon Christ, or else the expressions would
   not agree; for he it is that stands as the prime federate, to receive
   the promises for all his brethren: Gen. xii. 3, In thee shall all the
   families of the earth be blessed.' The covenant of works was made with
   Adam and all mankind, and Adam received it for all his race: so does
   Christ. Well, then, you see the necessity and benefit of union with
   Christ, that you may be entitled to his care as he is the only
   federate, that you may receive his bequests and legacies as testator
   and ordainer of the covenant, that he may mediate for you, and go to
   God for you; and as he is Mediator, he may undertake for you; and as a
   surety he may bestow blessings upon you, as your head, as the chiefest
   of the body that is called Christ.

   3. To love God. You have the greatest experience of the love of the
   Godhead that possibly you could have, that there should be a covenant
   between the persons of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
   Spirit, that they would mutually engage one another for your good. It
   is the highest endearment you could have from them, that God should
   ordain you his Son to carry on the work of your salvation; therefore
   engage and give up yourselves to God again: seeing the Lord should
   devise such a way, and Christ effect it, give up your selves by
   covenant to God.

   But I come now to the matter, or to handle the words absolutely, and
   not considered under that conditional and federate form: When thou
   shalt make his soul an offering for sin,' or, as it is in the Hebrew,
   When he shall make his soul sin (ascham), the sin or the
   trespass-offering. His soul, that is, himself: What is a man profited
   if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?' Mat. xvi. 26;
   that is, himself, body and soul. So his soul, that is himself, shall he
   make an offering for sin. His whole man was offered up. He could not
   sacrifice his divinity. The apostle Peter saith, He suffered in the
   flesh.'

   Doct. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ was the only true satisfactory and
   expiatory sacrifice for sin.

   1. Because it was of God's own ordaining. God will be pleased with
   nothing but what he appoints. Foolish man would fain give laws to
   heaven, and think to please God with what liketh himself best either in
   worship or in sacrifices; as if God would be enticed by their own lure.
   Christ is the only ascham: God requireth not ten thou sand rivers of
   oil; and all things else are nothing to God's will. Christ was of his
   own appointment, and therefore expiatory: Rom. iii. 25, Whom God hath
   set forth to be a propitiation;' 1 John iv. 10, God hath sent his Son
   to be a propitiation for our sins.' It is not expiatory, if God, the
   party offended, did not accept of Christ: Eph. v. 2, He gave himself
   for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour;'
   that is, for an acceptable sacrifice: all other sacrifices were an
   abomination to this.

   2. Other sacrifices were but types of this, they could not make the
   comers to them perfect, as the apostle proveth, Heb. ix. 9. There was
   expiation, but not real, except Christ was eyed in them. They could not
   make him that did the service perfect, as appertaining to the
   conscience: that is, they could not satisfy the conscience. The sin was
   not forgiven through their worthiness, they could not have any solid
   ground that justice was satisfied; this is a thing that naturally
   troubleth a man, how to satisfy justice, and to appease the revengeful
   deity. Naturally there is such a sense in guilty man, and that was the
   reason why they would have somewhat above sacrifices, because still
   there was something that stuck with them, that this was not enough. And
   therefore they in Micah added their first-born, Micah vi.; 2 Chron.
   xxxiii. 6, And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the
   valley of the son of Hinnom.' There was somewhat that caused parents to
   be so unnatural besides the example of the heathens. And truly it was
   because their consciences were not perfect. They had not the good
   answer that Peter speaketh of, they could not be persuaded God was
   appeased by the killing of a beast.

   3. No other thing could be satisfactory and expiatory besides the
   sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The prophet Isaiah bringeth in God as
   saying, He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no
   intercessor, therefore his arm brought salvation.' Man could have had
   no other person to interpose for him. Therefore Christ, who is the arm
   of the Lord, he brought salvation to him. All the angels in heaven were
   not able to lay down a valuable consideration; there was no
   intercessor, no intervener, none that could come between man and wrath.
   No creature can stand before infinite wrath to countermand it; man was
   not able, nor all his tears available. The law taketh no notice of
   sorrow for sin. It is true, the creature was easily inclined to think
   of merit in that which is dolorous and costly; but it is but a vain
   thought, the law is satisfied only through full and complete obedience.
   Your prayers would not do. Christ doth not barely pray to God, but
   offer himself also. His entreaties alone would not have been
   sufficient: Heb. ix. 22, Without shedding of blood there is no
   remission.'

   4. Christ sacrificing of himself complied with God's design, which is
   double:--

   [1.] To discover the glory of the Trinity, his love to the souls of
   men, and the Spirit's efficacy. These things would not have been drawn
   out for the creatures' benefit, had it not been for this design. The
   Father is glorified in being the contriver, the Son in being the
   Mediator, the Spirit as the applier and settler of comfort in the
   hearts of Christians. This was a high honour to Christ, next to that
   personal glory that he had with the Father before all worlds. When
   Christ was about to die, he saith, John xiii. 31, Now is the Son of man
   glorified, and God is glorified in him.' The Son especially; and not
   him alone, but the whole Godhead; the Spirit is glorified in your sense
   and experience of him.

   [2.] To magnify his justice and displeasure against sin: Rom. iii. 25,
   God set out Christ to declare his righteousness in the remission of
   sin.' God would have us be reconciled, not only by way of entreaties,
   but satisfaction. You can as well stand before the seat of judgment as
   the throne of grace, if God forgives sinners. God's justice is more
   glorified in punishing sin in Christ, than if all the world had been
   lost for sin. This appears by the impartialness of it, that God should
   not spare his own Son; but the merit of it is full, here is room for
   acceptation through the worth of his person that did all. If men had
   been damned, God would be glorifying his justice, but never be said to
   be glorified. It is more to the creditor to have his debt paid at once,
   than always a-paying. Ten thousand pounds is a long time a-paying by a
   poor man in shillings, but a rich man layeth it down in a little time,
   and pays all.

   Use 1. Then disclaim other satisfactions, your tears, your duties, your
   repentance; do not think to please God with these. Alas! you will never
   know when the work is done fully. Men make their way to God easy
   through these. Naturally we trust in our works and duties; these are
   rather fruits than causes. Look higher than your prayers and tears, to
   Jesus Christ.

   I^now come to the third reason why the death and sufferings of Christ
   are not ignominious to him; and it is drawn from the fruits of his
   sufferings, which are three:--

   The first is a propagation of his spiritual seed: He shall see his
   seed.' By seed, usually the scripture meaneth posterity; he shall see
   his holy posterity; that is, those that are begotten to Christ by the
   word. Observe here two things:--

   1. That believers are the seed of Christ.

   2. That Christ shall live to see his seed.

   Doct. That believers are Christ's seed.

   By purchase and covenant he hath obtained it of the Father, that you
   should be his generation and his posterity. The whole world in some
   sense is God's offspring, Acts xvii. 28. The apostle quoteth it out of
   a poet--tou gar kai` ge'nos esme`n; but the special seed, the spiritual
   seed, that is appointed to God the Son. Eph. iii. 15, it is said of the
   Lord Jesus, Of whom the whole family of heaven and earth is named.'
   Saints militant and triumphant are named from him. As the parents give
   the name to their posterity--as Jacob to Joseph's sons, and Zacharias
   to John the Baptist--so Christ to believers. It is just here as it was
   with Abraham: Gen. xxi. 12, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.' Abraham
   had another son, but that should not be counted his race; not in
   Ishmael, but in Isaac. So here; every son of Adam is the son of God,
   Luke iii. 38, but in Christ shall thy seed be called. Men cannot be
   God's sons, but by being Christ's seed. You have no spiritual right to
   God's fatherhood out of him.

   Object. But you will say, How are believers Christ's seed, since it is
   said everywhere that we are born of God, and especially it is said, 1
   John iii. 1, Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon
   us, that we should be called the sons of God'? And in other places it
   seemeth we are the Spirit's seed: John iii. 5, Except a man be born of
   water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.' And
   we are said to be born of the Spirit;' 1 Cor. iv. 15, Yet have ye not
   many fathers, for in Christ Jesus have I begotten you through the
   gospel.' My answer shall be in these reasons:--

   1. By reason of the gift of the Father, who made over all dispensations
   and all relations to the Son: John v. 22, He hath committed all
   judgment to the Son.' So All things are delivered to me of my Father,'
   Mat. xi. 25. So that quickening, life, and all cometh from the Son; and
   God the Father worketh nothing in us but in reference to the Lord
   Christ; and he hath given over all his interest and relations to
   Christ: John xvii. 6, Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.' They
   were God's sons, but he made them over to Christ, so that all the
   relation that we have to God the Father is through the Son; he is our
   Father, as he is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and we come to
   have interest in the love of the Father by the love of the Son: for it
   is said, John i. 12, As many as received him, to them gave he power to
   become the sons of God.' It is Christ gave us that power and
   prerogative. So Gal. iv. 5, That we that were under the law might
   receive the adoption of sons.' So that you see, through the gift of the
   Father, we are Christ's seed. He worketh nothing in us, and doth own us
   no further than we belong to the Son: for, as he is Christ's Father, so
   he is our Father; and as his seed, we are God's sons born to him.

   2. Because the Lord Christ did so much to purchase them and gain us for
   his seed.

   [1.] He died for them. Christ, like Rachel, dieth, that he may bring
   forth. Perit dum parit--he perisheth that he may bring forth. You are
   Benonis, the children of his sorrows: John xii. 24, Except a corn of
   wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it
   bringeth forth much fruit,' not else. Isaac had not a promise of
   increase and a numerous issue till he was ready to be offered. When in
   this chapter the prophet had spoken of the sufferings of Christ, he
   comes to say, Isa. liv. 1, Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear;
   break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail
   with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children
   of the married wife, saith the Lord.' Christ liveth to make you
   fruitful: Heb. ii. 10, To bring many sons to glory, the captain of
   their salvation was made perfect through sufferings.' God would not
   have his birth exempt from the fate and lot of all bearings; even
   Christ did bring forth in sorrows.

   [2.] Because he sendeth forth power and efficacy to beget them.

   (1.) He provideth the word, and blesseth it with power and efficacy; as
   you may see, 1 Peter i. 23, Being born again, not of corruptible seed,
   but of incorruptible, by the word of God that liveth and abideth for
   ever;' and in the 25th verse you see what word, to wit, The word which
   by the gospel is preached unto you,' the word preached in Christ's
   name, this word begets us. Therefore ministers are said to be
   instruments in the hand of Christ, as he is pleased to bless their
   endeavours. It is said in Ps. cx. 3, From the womb of the morning thou
   hast the dew of thy youth.' The meaning is, that believers should be
   born to Christ like dewdrops in the morning of the first dawning of
   heavenly light: 1 Cor. iv. 15, For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you
   through the gospel.' Others were but schoolmasters; he was their father
   in Christ. God provideth nurses and subordinate parents, to whom he
   conveyeth his own honour. It is by Christ's blessing upon their care
   and ministry.

   (2.) By his Spirit. It is Christ's Spirit that bringeth you to be new
   creatures. He worketh so as he may glorify Christ. The efficiency of
   the Spirit is the seed of Christ. Therefore it is said of one that is
   born of God, 1 John iii. 9, that his seed remaineth in him.' The power
   of the Spirit is a seed by which we are made new creatures, Titus iii.
   6, The renewing of the Holy Ghost is shed on us abundantly, through
   Jesus Christ, our Saviour.' The true virtue is from the Spirit shed on
   us through Christ Jesus. All that are new creatures are begotten by his
   word, actuated and quickened by his Spirit, and therefore they are
   called his seed.

   3. The next reason is, because all that is done to believers is to form
   the image of Christ upon them: Gal. iv. 19, My little children, of whom
   I travail in birth again till Christ be formed in you.' The work of
   conversion is but the stamping and drawing out the lineaments of Christ
   upon the soul. So it is said, Rom. viii. 29, summo'rphous tes eiko'nos,
   Whom he did foreknow, he also predestinated to be conformed to the
   image of his Son.' God intended us to be his seed, because the new
   creature is most like him. The acts of Christianity are expressed by
   our being planted into the likeness of his death and resurrection,'
   Rom. vi. 5. The acts that pass forth into the soul for the subduing of
   sin, for quickening of grace; it is a planting and forming Christ's
   image and likeness: and the whole carriage that passeth from us, it is
   through the Spirit, it is but a discovery of Christ's life. Therefore,
   the seed, likeness, form, and features are an argument of parentage:
   children are but the parents multiplied, and new set forth to the
   world.

   To apply it.

   Use 1. Is a word to the careless world. Look to it whose seed you are.

   There are divers seeds in the world.

   1. There are some that are only the offspring of God in a large sense,
   have no other claim but by the first Adam. Ignorant men look upon
   themselves under no other notion than that of God's creatures. Oh!
   consider your happiness lieth in your relation unto God through Christ.
   You shall see the main encouragement to prayer, or any address to him,
   is when you can come and call him Father. God is sweet to you when you
   can call upon him as sons and daughters. But, alas! what a sad thing is
   it when men have no other title to God but their creation! Isa. xxvii.
   11, He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed
   them will show them no favour.' Ignorant people say, God that made them
   shall save them. No; such an interest and claim to God will not avail
   you; he that made them will not save them; God will reckon his seed in
   Isaac, that is, in Christ. There is no privilege in claiming by
   Ishmael.

   2. There are some that are yet worse, by the virulence and bitterness,
   and rage of heart against the ways of God; they are possessed with an
   opposite seed--the seed of the serpent: Gen. iii. 15, I will put enmity
   between thy seed and her seed.' There is a seed that is full of envy
   and enmity against the people and ways of God: Mat. iii. 7, O
   generation of vipers!' the very spawn and seed of vipers.

   3. There is the holy seed, against whom all the powers of darkness are
   armed: Rev. xii. 17, And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went
   to war with the remnant of her seed, which kept the commandments of
   God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.' The generation of men
   that worshipped God in Jesus Christ, those are they that are hated by
   the world, and yet they are the pillars of the earth, Isa. vi. 13.
   Therefore, look to yourselves whose seed you are. If the Spirit of
   Christ hath not been shed out upon you, to new form you through the
   word; if you are not formed more and more into the image of the Lord
   Jesus, you are none of his seed. Consider who is your root; your fall
   lieth in this. God doth not deal with single men, but with the common
   root and author of the whole seed. Adam was a miscarrying root, but
   Christ is not.

   Use 2. Here is a word to the seed of Jesus Christ, to believers. You
   may say indeed, Ps. c. 4, It is he that made us, and not we ourselves;
   we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.' You are of the Lord's
   making, and therefore of the Lord's keeping. The seed of Jesus Christ
   are preserved in him. The whole work of Christ is the workmanship of
   God in Christ Jesus, Eph. ii. 10. Therefore, look up to him. Children's
   dependence is upon the parents, and yours is upon the supplies of
   Christ, for your heavenly Father knoweth what he hath made. Here is--

   1. Direction to you to whom to look for increase of grace. It is the
   rule of nature, all things are nourished by those things by which they
   are begotten. God maketh the next causes to be the conveyances of
   support to his creatures. God begetteth you by his Spirit, actuating
   and quickening the word, and so he keepeth you: 1 Peter ii. 2, As
   new-born babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow
   thereby.'

   2. Exhortation to press you to conform to Jesus Christ. You are his
   seed, and therefore it is an engagement to likeness: children are to
   bear and show forth the image and likeness of their parents. Christ
   makes imitation an argument of parentage: John viii. 37, I know that ye
   are Abraham's seed, but ye seek to kill me.' A degenerate offspring are
   a shame to their ancestors. They were children of God, that came of an
   ancient royal family, but yet were unworthy of their extraction, I
   Chron. iv. 22, Who had dominion in Moab and Jashubilehem: and these are
   ancient things.' Base powers came of them that preferred sordid
   drudgery work to the king of Babylon before working in the temple. What
   doth it avail to speak of the ancient honour of our family when we are
   degenerated from it? Oh, take heed you be not a stain to Jesus Christ.
   You came of a noble seed, the whole family of God is named of him.
   Ishmael came of Abraham; but cast out the bondwoman and her son.' God
   will have no bond slaves to inherit this honour. To be enslaved to sin,
   and to pretend sonship by Christ, will provoke to a casting out.
   Children, unless degenerate, will hold out the honour of their parents,
   and walk in the high steps of their ancestors; and so must you show
   from whose loins and life you came by a worthy walking before God.

   Use 3. Here is a word of consolation. A great deal of comfort it is to
   be of the seed of Christ; as--

   1. Consider what an honour is done you. By this you have a title and
   claim to the whole Godhead: He gave you power to become the sons of
   God.' You belong to his care, being the seed of Christ. As some living
   fathers among the emperors did make their children co partners with
   them in their dignity, so are you sharers with Christ in all his
   privileges: Rom. viii. 17, And if children, then heirs of God, and
   joint-heirs with Christ.' Our Saviour saith, John xx. 17, I ascend to
   my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.' As if you were
   in the same rank with Christ. And therefore it is said, Heb. ii. 11, He
   is not ashamed to call them brethren.' Christ doth not think it a
   disgrace to him that they should be invested in his honours and
   privileges.

   2. This relation engageth affection.

   [1.] It engageth Christ's delight to Christians. As parents' joy is in
   their seed, so is Christ's in your thriving and welfare. God hath made
   love naturally descending and running down to them that come from us.
   Christ is brought in as a type of Isaiah, Heb. ii. 13, rejoicing over
   his children: Behold I and the children which thou hast given me.'
   Believers are a pleasure and glory to him. To look upon the
   numerousness of the saints is a pleasant sight to Christ; as to a
   father to see the increase of his loins: Isa. lxii. 4, For the Lord
   delighteth in thee.' Christ rejoiceth over his seed. It is promised as
   a privilege that he should see his seed, implying it should be a
   delight to Christ. And what a comfort is this, that we should be
   Christ's joy! Therefore Paul saith, Phil. i. 8, God is my record how
   greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ;' that is,
   as the bowels of Jesus Christ did yearn after you, with such like
   bowels do I yearn for you.

   [2.] It engageth Christ's care of you. He shall see his seed; and you
   are his seed, and therefore he will look after you. He watcheth these
   great births, that they may not miscarry; and is as it were bound that
   we may lack nothing. All his care is about his seed: Cant. ii. 17,
   Christ walketh in the gardens to look after the green figs and tender
   grapes, that he may apply himself to them. The apostle saith, he is
   worse than an infidel that provideth not for his own;' not only beneath
   grace, but beneath nature. And certainly Christ will have a more tender
   regard to his own seed. The greatest expression of love that Christ
   would have spoken to Peter was to feed his lambs, John xxi. 15. We may
   look to him for provisions: Isa. xlix. 15, Can a woman forget her
   sucking child? She may, but I will not forget thee.' Men, by debauching
   their spirits, may wear out the impressions of natural affections, but
   Christ cannot forget his own seed: The foundation of the Lord standeth
   sure.'

   I come now to the second point.

   Doct. That Christ shall see his seed, or an increase of the faithful
   through his word and Spirit. It noteth two things:--

   First, The life of Christ. Many leave seed that do not see it, being
   snatched from their children and comforts as soon as they grow into any
   hopes: but Christ's seeing his seed implieth he should live to see it
   propagated throughout all successions of time.

   First observation, That the seed of Christ have a living parent: He
   shall see his seed.' God's children can never be orphans. We say by
   many that their parents died too soon for them, because they were but
   young, and exposed to the hazards and uncertainties of the world. But
   believers cannot be left as orphans: John xiv. 18, I will not leave you
   comfortless; I will come to you again.'

   Well, then, to apply it: Lay up this comfort, though Christ be ascended
   and gone out of your sight, yet he seeth his seed, he liveth to take
   care for you. You have not his corporeal presence, but you have the
   presence of his Spirit to direct you: John xvi. 7, It is expedient for
   you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come
   to you.' Christ cannot die too soon; his absence in the flesh is
   abundantly recompensed and made up in the Spirit. That more generally
   and more particularly is the comfort that you have by the life of
   Christ as you are his seed: and therefore I shall not handle it at
   large.

   1. You may be sure you are still an object working upon his affections.
   The sight of things worketh more vehemently upon us than the conceit of
   them. Imagination hath a great force upon the spirit, but not so great
   as the senses, as tasting, seeing, and the like. As you shall see in
   impure love: Gen. xxxix. 7, she cast her eyes upon Joseph, and said,
   Lie with me;' Mat. v. 28, Lusting cometh by looking. So in pure
   affection love is enkindled by the presence of the object. You may
   discern the workings of nature in these instances. As you shall see in
   another case; when God would stir up or provoke the rage of his
   justice, it is said, And God looked upon the earth, and behold it was
   corrupt.' It is spoken after the manner of man. It is true of the man
   Christ Jesus, who, looking upon us, and seeing our state and case, is
   the more touched with the feeling of our infirmities, Heb. iv. 15. It
   is said in Mat. xiv. 14, Christ saw a great multitude, and was moved
   with compassion towards them. Christ's eye presented objects to his
   pity; therefore the prophet speaketh to Christ: Isa. lxiii. 15, Look
   down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and
   thy glory.' Christ shall see his seed; not only know their state by
   imagination, but live to look into their particular wants: Though
   Abraham be ignorant of us,' yet Christ liveth to see the several states
   of his seed.

   2. You may be sure that he is able to give you a constant and
   sufficient supply. Parents, that only leave a portion, cannot provide
   against all hazards. Christ doth not only leave you a portion, and so
   let you shift for yourselves, but you are still under his eye and care:
   Rev. ii. 2, I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience.' That
   was the ground of Christ's pity to her: he ever seeth his seed. It was
   the prodigal's comfort, that though he had spent all, yet still his
   father was living: Luke xv. 17, There is bread enough in my father's
   house.' God doth not give us a stock of grace, and leave us to our
   selves; we are still in the family, and under the Father's eye and
   care. You have a parent that liveth for ever, that dispenseth his grace
   to you, and teacheth you how you may manage it without impair and loss.
   A father, whilst living, will not put the whole out of his own hands;
   it is best that our stock is still in Christ's keeping.

   Secondly, He shall see his seed, noteth the increase that is implied in
   the phrase seed put indefinitely: it is put for a multitude, such a
   seed as is worth looking after. Observe then--

   Second observation, That Jesus Christ hath a plenteous seed and
   numerous offspring. In the exposition I showed you it is plural, He
   shall see his seeds.' It is parallel with that, He shall see his
   children's children.' A seed propagated through many successions of
   ages. This appeareth by the promises made to the types of Christ; as--

   1. To several of the patriarchs, &c., viz., Isaac, Ham, Jacob, David,
   whose posterity was a shadow of it: Jer. xxxii. 22, As the host of
   heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured, so
   will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that
   minister unto me.' Great shall be the number of those that are grafted
   into Christ, and made kings and priests to him. So to Abraham: Gen.
   xxviii. 14, And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou
   shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and
   to the south; and in thee and thy seed shall all the families of the
   earth be blessed.' It is meant principally of the holy and spiritual
   seed: Gen. xxxii. 12, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as
   the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.' Balaam
   says, Num. xxiii. 10, Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number
   of the fourth part of Israel?' It is meant of Jacob's sons that are
   propagated; and it is meant of Israel's sons among the Gentiles
   principally, though not with exclusion of the other: Hosea i. 10, Yet
   the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea,
   which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall be said to them, Ye
   are the sons of the living God;' which is applied by the apostle to the
   church among the Gentiles.

   2. To the church: Isa. liv. 1,2,' Sing, O barren, thou that didst not
   bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not
   travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the
   children of the married wife. Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let
   them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not,
   lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.' It is said, the land
   should grow too little: Isa. xlix. 19, The land shall be too narrow by
   reason of the inhabitants;' Isa. lx. 8, Who are these that fly as a
   cloud, and as the doves to the windows?' Doves fly in flocks, so that
   they even darken the air.

   3. To Christ; as here, that he should see his seed: Ps. ii. 8, Ask of
   me, and I will give the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utter
   most parts of the earth for thy possession;' Rev. vii. 9, After this I
   beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all
   nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the
   throne, and before the Lamb.'

   Use 1. Be not discouraged at the church's paucity and fewness. Men say
   they are popular, and go against the whole world: Gen. xix. 9, This one
   fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge.' Elijah was
   zealous alone. Do not be discouraged. A grain of mustard-seed will grow
   into a tree, Mat. xiii. A little flock may increase, so that you must
   stretch forth the curtains, and strengthen the stakes. The little stone
   hewed out of the mountain filled the whole earth, Dan. ii. 35; and Job
   viii. 7, Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should
   greatly increase.'

   2. Wait and pray for the increase of it, for the coming in of the
   fulness of the Gentiles, Rom. xi. 25. Pray that the waters of the
   sanctuary may go out to the former and latter sea, Zech. xiv. 8.

   We are now come to the second fruit of the sufferings of Christ: He
   shall prolong his days;' that is, though he die, the term of his life
   shall never be the shorter for it; he shall live for ever. Some apply
   this to the seed of Christ before mentioned; as if the sense were, He
   shall prolong the days of his seed. And the Seventy favour this sense
   in their translation, for they render this clause with the former, He
   shall see his seed to be long-lived.' I confess the result is the same;
   for if Christ be long-lived, we shall be long-lived; our life and glory
   hang upon his life and glory. But I conceive this phrase more expressly
   and properly doth concern Christ himself. The point is then--

   Doct. That the days of the Lord Jesus Christ were not shortened by his
   dying, but rather prolonged and lengthened out to eternity.

   I cannot give you the full discussion, having spoken much concerning it
   upon that place which I shall now quote as the proof of it: Isa. liii.
   8, Who shall declare his generation?' that is, who can count the number
   of his age and duration? The reason is--

   Because, after suffering, Christ was to return to the glory of his God
   head: Luke xxiv. 26, Ought not Christ to have suffered these things,
   and to enter into his glory?' He was to put off meanness and death;
   these things could have no more dominion over him. He returned to all
   the other glories, and therefore to the glory of his immortality. And
   hence the apostle saith of our Lord Christ, l Tim. vi. 16, Who only
   hath immortality, dwelling in the light;' that is, in opposition to the
   creatures. He only hath it to dispose of it, and in himself; for
   otherwise we are immortal in our souls; but it is only by his benefit
   and promise, and as we live in his life. Well, then, you see the reason
   is, because Christ is in possession of glory and immortality.

   Use 1. It maketh for the comfort of believers: your Saviour liveth for
   ever. As the second person in the Trinity, he is immutably glorious;
   and as the Mediator, he hath eternity made over by grant and covenant
   to him. It is for your comfort divers ways; besides what I have spoken
   to before, take these:--

   1. If Christ be eternal, then his love is eternal, his care and his
   mercy are eternal, his kingdom is eternal: Isa. ix. 6, 7, Of the
   increase of his government and peace there is no end.' Everything in
   Christ is prolonged to you. As you find Christ to you now, so he will
   be to you for ever. It is true, there may be some withdrawings of love
   and grace as to our apprehensions. And so Job saith, Job xxx. 21, Thou
   art become cruel to me.' Saints may think they have lost God and lost
   grace, when it is only through the weakness of their own apprehensions;
   there may be a different appearance of Christ to the creature, but his
   heart is the same to them still; like children, that think the sun doth
   not give light but when they see it breaking out in glory. There is
   light for you in Christ, though you cannot see it through the darkness
   that is upon your spirits.

   2. Here is relief against all our enemies. Is it the shortness of life?
   Ps. cii. 11, 12, My days are like a shadow that declineth, and I am
   withered like grass; but thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever.' It may
   be you are assaulted with weaknesses, you carry about you a sickly,
   crazy, body that is ready at every turn to drop into the grave. This is
   a trouble to you: God having placed in the creature naturally a desire
   of immortality, the vanity and perishableness of their being is a
   trouble to them. But consider, Christ is long-lived, and therefore your
   glory shall not be left in the dust, nor God's holy ones left to
   corruption and rottenness. Christ's life was not shortened by his
   death, but prolonged; so shall yours be that have an interest in him.
   Oh, see that your lives are made long in the prolongation of Christ's
   life; for as the body liveth in the life of the soul, so shall we live
   in the life of Christ. See how the church draweth out this comfort
   everywhere: Hab. i. 12, Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God,
   my Holy One? We shall not die.' We cannot perish if we have an interest
   in one that is everlasting: Ps. cii. 27, 28, Thy years shall have no
   end; therefore the children of thy servants shall continue, and their
   seed shall be established before thee.' It is taken for a good
   consequence, that if God continueth, the saints shall continue: Thy
   years have no end, therefore their seed shall be established.' What a
   privilege is this, that creatures that are in their own nature but of a
   day's standing, as it were, should have their lives prolonged to the
   continuance of their Maker!

   3. This will support and settle the heart in doubtful times, in days of
   misery and violence. Your hearts are ready to be overcome, to see the
   thriving of wicked men; and you know not how dangers may grow upon you.
   Consider, the days of the Lord Christ are prolonged; let them flourish
   never so long, he will outlive them. A man would comfort himself in
   this, if he knew that the interest of religion would thrive to a long
   continuance. Why, you may be sure Christ will take care of his church:
   Ps. ix. 6, 7, O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end;
   but the Lord shall endure for ever.' Their enemies are such as must
   die, but Christ will never die; his days are prolonged, but their days
   are shortened: Ps. lv. 23, Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out
   half their days.' You may see an end of Christ's enemies, but never of
   the life of Christ. Alas! who would fear them? You may be sure when
   they perish, Christ will remain: Ps. xcii. 8, 9, But thou, Lord, are
   most high for evermore. Thine enemies shall perish, all the workers of
   iniquity shall be scattered.' Still you have an eternal God, and an
   everlasting Christ, that will live beyond your enemies.

   4. It is comfort in the loss of outward enjoyments. Alas! their nature
   is vanishing, even the most glorious of all the creatures. The heavens
   shall be like a scorched scroll: Ps. cii. 26, They shall perish, but
   thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old as doth a garment, as
   a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.' But you
   have an interest in a more lasting comfort, in a Christ whose days are
   prolonged, though all things else perish before you.

   Use 2. Is advice to the world, first, to get an interest in Christ; his
   friendship will last. Make a friend of him, that you may be sure will
   abide by you to the last. This is Christ's argument for improvement of
   wealth: They will receive you into everlasting habitations,' Luke xvi.
   9, to wit, those whose bowels you have refreshed. Make friends of the
   saints, but especially of Christ, that when other things fail, you may
   have an eternal God to stand by you. Christ is a friend that can never
   fail. Barzillai commended his son to David, 2 Sam. xix. 37; but David
   must yield to the fate of all men, and was forced to leave him to
   Solomon, 1 Kings ii. 7. Oh, commend your souls to Christ, and he will
   not leave them to another. His days are prolonged, and he doth not
   yield to the fate of the creatures. Well then, choose him. Those are
   not friends that beguile you in your hopes (and then are not able to
   stead you), as the creatures do. Christ is a friend that is able to
   stand by you in the worst of times; he will confess you before his
   Father in heaven.

   2. He will give you long life, which is the great desire of the
   creatures: Ps. xxxiv. 12, What man is he that desireth life, and loveth
   many days, that he may see good?' What man is there that doth not
   desire to live long? that is the meaning of it: Prov. iii. 16, Length
   of days is in her right hand, and in her left riches and honour,'
   Length of days is the right-hand blessing of wisdom; it is the blessing
   of Jesus Christ. Therefore it is said, Eternal life is in the Son: and
   he that hath the Son hath life; his days are prolonged, and he will
   prolong and lengthen out yours to eternity.

   Having showed the things most proper to this phrase, I come now to the
   latter clause, that the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his
   hands.' The point is, that all the will and pleasure of God shall
   prosper and be effectual in the hands of Jesus Christ.

   Reasons--

   1. Because he is the choice instrument of God, the special servant of
   his decrees, therefore everywhere called his servant: Isa. xlii. 1,
   Behold my servant, whom I uphold.' He is God's servant as Mediator,
   therefore God will uphold him, and hear him out in his work: Isa. liii.
   11, By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many.'
   Certainly God's will and work will thrive in the hands of Christ. When
   God raiseth up any special instrument among the creatures to accomplish
   his pleasure, they are successful. Nebuchadnezzar, that was but a
   remoter servant of God's decrees, and one taken in by the by to do
   God's will, he was prosperous: Jer. xxv. 9, Behold, I will send and
   take all the families of the north, saith the Lord, and Nebuchadnezzar
   the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this
   land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these
   nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and will make them
   an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolation.' So the Medes
   and Persians, when called to the service of God's decrees, they were
   successful: Isa. xiii. 3, I have commanded my sanctified ones; I have
   also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my
   highness.' They are set apart for that work. The lowest servants of the
   decrees cannot miscarry, much less, then, can Christ, the choicest
   instrument of God's decrees.

   2. Because the Lord Christ is so qualified that the will of God must
   needs prosper with him.

   [1.] He is willing and ready to comply with the will of God the Father.
   It is motive sufficient to Christ that it is the Father's plea sure:
   John iv. 34, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to
   finish his work.' It is Christ's pleasure, as much as God's, to work
   out the good of the creatures. Work is best done by a willing servant;
   now Christ is willing. As God gave Christ, so Christ gave himself to
   die for man. The Father's delight is to you, and so is the Son's; and
   therefore the business is not like to miscarry, Prov. viii. 31. Christ
   is brought in speaking as the Wisdom of the Father, rejoicing in the
   habitable parts of the earth, and my delights are with the sons of
   men.' Christ's delights were with men; it was a pleasure to him to do
   them good. The pleasure of the Lord will prosper in any hand, but
   especially in the hands of Christ, for it is his own pleasure.

   [2.] He is able and mighty, so as he must needs effectuate the will of
   God: Ps. lxxxix. 19, I have laid help upon one that is mighty.' It is
   an able Christ that the work is committed to, that can break through
   discouragements, overcome difficulties, remove lets. Alas! there is no
   mountain that is anything before this Zerubbabel: Col. i. 19, It
   pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.' He wanteth
   nothing for the accomplishment of this work, there is a fulness and
   supply of all things: Col. ii. 3, In him are hid all the treasures of
   wisdom and knowledge.' There is an unexhausted treasury of grace and
   knowledge to be found in Christ; it was hid, the world does not easily
   see it, but there is a rich magazine of grace, and sufficiency to
   effect all the will of God; but our weakness measureth things by
   appearance, and till God bringeth us within the veil we can not see it.

   But you will say, What is this pleasure of the Lord?

   I answer--It is the whole decree of God about the good of the
   creatures; more especially, that I may open your hearts to the view of
   some cases, these comforts work best when they are drawn forth into
   particulars.

   1. There are some more general, that concern the universality and body
   of men; and so the pleasure of the Lord is that Christ should gather
   churches out of the world, out of all kindreds and nations in the
   world; and then give them his laws; and this Christ will do,
   notwithstanding the rage of tyrants, and the malice of evil men: The
   isles shall wait for his law.' And it is said, Isa. ix. 7, The zeal of
   the Lord of hosts will perform this.' The Lord hath sworn he will
   maintain him against all the attempts of the world; that the gospel
   shall get ground and prosper. Now, see if Christ's hand miscarried in
   these general works: Acts ii. 4, three thousand were converted by one
   sermon; one apostle preached the gospel from Jerusalem to Illyricum,
   and that was some thousands of miles, Rom. xv. 19. These general works
   prospered by the good pleasure of the Lord.

   2. Some more special, as the reconciliation of sinners to God. This
   will thrive in Christ's hands, for it is God's pleasure: Luke iv. 18,
   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to
   preach the gospel to the poor, and sent me to heal the broken-hearted,
   to preach deliverance to the captives;' Col. i. 20, It pleased the
   Father that in him all fulness should dwell; and having made peace
   through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to
   himself.' The conversion of a sinner is the will of God: James i. 18,
   Of his own will begat he us, by the word of truth.' Do not doubt, then;
   there may be discouragements, but the will of God is for your
   regeneration. So the sanctification of the creatures: 1 Thes. iv. 3,
   This is the will of God, even your sanctification.' This is one of the
   wills that shall prosper in the hands of Christ, your preservation and
   keeping in a state of grace: John vi. 34, And this is the Father's
   will, who hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should
   lose nothing.' You may have many assaults, but it is God's will you
   should be kept. Nay, it is his will to glorify you: Luke xii. 32, It is
   your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.'

   Use. What an abundance of encouragement to faith is there from every
   word that is here used!

   1. That all the work of Christ for your good is called chephets, the
   Lord's pleasure. We may come to men for things with greater confidence
   when we know it is their pleasure to give them to us. It was an
   encouragement to Joab to set the woman of Tekoah at work to bring home
   Absalom, because the thing was pleasing to the king: 2 Sam. xiv. 1,
   When he perceived the king's heart was towards Absalom.' So when we
   perceive God's heart towards a thing, we may the better urge him to it.
   Among men we easily speed in an errand that is pleasing to him to whom
   we go: Ps. xxxv. 27, The Lord hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
   servants.' All that can make for good to you, it is the Lord's
   pleasure; your welfare is his delight; nay, to those that are without,
   for them to come in to be recovered and accepted to mercy, it is the
   Lord's pleasure. So it is in prayer, when you come with such requests
   to the throne of grace; you speak to God's bowels when you ask for such
   things as are acceptable to him as they can be to yourselves. We have
   two hints of God's pleasure--chaphets, it pleased the Lord to bruise
   him; and chephets, his pleasure in Christ's bruises was our good.

   2. It shall prosper. It goeth in the way of a promise; it is part of
   God's covenant with Christ to relieve your souls from doubts and fears;
   you may go and urge it to him--Lord, was it not thy covenant that thy
   pleasure should prosper in the hands of Christ? This is thy pleasure.
   Christ urgeth this covenant, and therefore you may urge it: John xvii.
   4, 5, I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finished the work thou
   gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own
   self, with the glory I had with thee before the world was.' Tell him
   Christ observed his ordinances to a tittle; you may plead promises
   though not performances; you may plead Christ's merit, though not your
   own. But to the word, shall prosper. This signifieth to break through,
   or pierce through. Alas! all difficulties are nothing. They are but as
   a fly upon the wheel, that cannot hinder the motion. Rage and
   opposition will not hinder the collection and gathering the church of
   Christ. The devil, sin, and all the powers of darkness, shall not
   hinder the reconciling of a soul to Christ. The will of the Lord shall
   break through. Death nor the grave shall not hinder the glory of
   Christ. Mountains are nothing to Christ. God's pleasure is not retarded
   by difficulty; it breaketh through all.

   3. In his hand. Our hands would fail us, nay, be withered and decay.
   What is the reason discomfort seizeth upon men? They would have the
   will of God prosper in their own hands, like the monk that hopes to
   subdue corruption by his own vows, nihil videt prosperum: Gal. ii. 20,
   I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.' It is not in our hands,
   but in the hand of Christ. Oh that our souls would look up to him in
   the sense of our own weakness! Christ's hand is a strong hand: John x.
   28, No man shall pluck his sheep out of his hand.' The sheep are safe
   when in the hand of Christ, especially when upheld by God: Isa. xlii.
   6, I will hold thine hand, and keep thee.' It is not Christ as man
   only, but as upheld by the power of the Godhead. As a man, he himself
   is subject to agonies and consternations: Ps. lxxxix. 21, With whom my
   hand shall be established, and mine arm shall strengthen him.'
     __________________________________________________________________

THE ELEVENTH VERSE.

   He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his
   knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear
   their iniquities.

   THE prophet goeth on in describing the glorious effects of the covenant
   of God with Jesus Christ, and his obedience and humiliation answerable
   thereunto. God the Father's part was to bestow privileges, grace, and
   glory, and every good thing upon believers; and God the Son's part was
   to obey, and suffer, and die, to submit himself to all kind of labour
   and travail of spirit for our sakes: for God being about to deal with
   us in mercy, would first deal with Christ in justice; and the state of
   the work of redemption was so laid, that, as Suarez proveth well, our
   grace and glory was due to Christ injustice, as the reward of his
   merit. Much was spoken before what God would do, and what Christ might
   expect in case he would lay down his soul as an offering for sin; he
   should see his seed, prolong his days, and God's pleasure should
   prosper in his hands.' And the prophet here goeth on in repeating the
   same thing, only addeth words more particular and significant, that he
   might more fully and expressly draw out the sense and meaning of the
   former privileges to your apprehensions: He shall see of the travail of
   his soul, and be satisfied.'

   In these words three things are asserted:--

   1. Christ's travail of soul in the work of our redemption.

   2. The certainty of success: he shall see; that is, reap the wished and
   expected fruits of his labour and sorrows, which is the comfort and
   salvation of poor creatures.

   3. His contentment therein: he shall be satisfied. He counts the
   salvation of lost sinners to be satisfaction enough for all his pains.
   You may take the words as relating to God's decree, or to the execution
   of it.

   [1.] As to God's decree, the foregoing verse intimateth the compact and
   bargain between God the Father and the Son; there were articles of
   agreement stated between them. Now when Christ came to consider what he
   should give, and what he should gain, he professeth he is satisfied,
   and abundantly pleased with the terms propounded. Our Lord Jesus made
   no blind bargain. He knew from all eternity what it would cost him to
   save sinners; he had leisure enough to cast up his accounts. And when
   he foresaw the temptations of the wilderness, and the agonies of the
   garden, the ignominy of the cross, the vile usage of his body, and the
   travail of his soul, yet saith our dearest Redeemer, I will go down and
   suffer upon these terms; I am satisfied out of all this, if a few
   broken-hearted creatures may be brought home to God.

   [2.] To the execution of God's decree. When sinners are brought to
   accept of mercy, I count my blood well shed, my bitter agonies well
   recompensed: here is wages enough for all my toil. There is joy in
   heaven, in Christ's heart, when a sinner is converted.

   I begin with the first; the travail of his soul. The word for travail
   noteth the highest degree of labour, such as is tiring and wearisome.
   The soul is often put for the whole man; so many souls came out of
   Egypt, that is, so many persons. So Acts xxvii. 37, There were in the
   ship two hundred threescore and six souls.' So that the travail of his
   soul is his whole labour and travail. Or properly it may imply his
   soul-troubles, which were the passion of his passion, the bitterest
   part of his sufferings: Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?'
   John xii. 27.

   The doctrine is, that our salvation cost Christ much travail of soul.
   He was afflicted in his whole man, but chiefly in his inward man.

   1. As a kind of imaginary person: he suffered in his reputation, which,
   is another kind of being in the hearts and opinions of others. They
   accuse him of the two highest crimes in either table, blasphemy and
   sedition; blasphemy against God, and sedition against Caesar, Luke
   xxiii. 2. They mock him in all his offices; his kingly office, by
   putting a soldier's coat upon him for a royal robe, a reed for a
   sceptre, and thorns for a crown, and floutingly saying unto him, Hail,
   King of the Jews,' Mat. xxvii. 29. In his prophetical office; when they
   had blindfolded him, they smote him on the face, saying, Prophesy who
   it was that smote thee;' scoffing at those who honoured him as a
   prophet. When he was upon the cross, offering up himself for our sins,
   they wagged the head, saying, Save thyself,' and He saved others,
   himself he cannot save.' Mat. xxvii. 39, 42. There they scoff at his
   priestly office, while doing the part of a Saviour.

   2. Nearer they come to his real person. In his body he suffered in
   every part, and afflictions were poured in upon him by the conduit of
   every sense. His feeling was exercised with weariness, and wounds, and
   scourges; his ears with their railing and the clamorous noises of
   popular outrage; his taste with vinegar and gall; his sight and smell
   with Golgotha, the place of skulls and dead men's bones. We have made
   all our senses inlets of sin, and therefore in Christ they were inlets
   of sorrow.

   But the consummation of his bodily sufferings was at his death, which
   consisted in the separation of the soul from the body, though both
   still remained united to the divine nature; otherwise for a while he
   would not be God-man, and his resurrection would be a new incarnation;
   though separate from one another, yet they were both united to the
   Godhead. As a man drawing his sword holdeth the sword in one hand, and
   the sheath in the other; there is a separation between the sword and
   the sheath, but the same man holdeth both. O Christians! do we believe
   this, and wonder no more that life itself should die, and Christ be
   free among the dead? If any had cause to love his life, Christ had;
   every man's life is valuable, much more Christ's, which was enriched
   with the continual presence of God. We are often a burden to ourselves;
   we wish for death; but that Christ should die, whose soul dwelt with
   God in a personal union, is a wonder.

   His death was not a naked death, but the painful, shameful, and
   accursed death of the cross. The law pronounced the death of the cross
   accursed: Deut. xxi. 23, He that is hanged is accursed of God.' In the
   account of all nations it is ignominious. It was cruel and painful, to
   show that he came to bear not only our curse but our sorrows: Gal. iii.
   13, He was made a curse for us;' Isa. liii. 4, Surely he hath borne our
   griefs, and carried our sorrows.' If you follow him to the grave, it
   was a continuation of his abasement, though not of his pain. Thither
   Christ went to shut and seal up our sins, that they should no more come
   into remembrance, as Abraham buried his dead out of his sight. If we
   look only to what was visible, Christ was a man of sorrows; his life
   was full of sorrows, his death violent, and bloody, and ignominious.

   But all this doth not answer the expression, travail of soul. Our souls
   sinned, and therefore Christ must lay down his soul as an offering for
   sin, Isa. liii. 10. In Christ's soul-sufferings we may take notice of
   two things--his desertion and agonies. These have some correspondence
   with the poena damni et sensus.

   I. His desertion: Mat. xxvii. 46, My God, my God, why hast thou
   forsaken me?' Christ's desertion cannot be meant of outward
   afflictions, of being left to the rage and violence of men. The word
   forsaking implieth God's withdrawing: 2 Cor. iv. 9, We are persecuted,
   but not forsaken;' though given up to the will of men, yet still
   enjoying the presence of God: but Christ was both persecuted and
   forsaken.

   But how could he be forsaken, who was God-man in the same person?

   Ans. As the personal union gave way to the death of the body, so it
   gave way to the troubles of the soul. Christ, by virtue of the eternal
   covenant, was to yield up the whole human nature, both body and soul,
   to suffer according to the will of God. Now, he declined no part of the
   service; as he offered his body to the pains of death, so his soul to
   the trouble of desertion.

   But what was this desertion?

   [1.] The personal union was not dissolved--the two natures united,
   achori'stos,--his inherent holiness not lessened, for then he should
   have been less fit to be either priest or sacrifice. God's love to him
   was not abated; he was now doing his work, and in the height of
   obedience: John x. 17, Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay
   down my life.' This was a new argument and reason of love.

   [2.] Assisting and sustaining grace was not wholly withdrawn: Isa.
   xlii. 1, Behold my servant, whom I uphold;' and John xvi. 32, I am not
   alone, because the Father is ever with me.' What was that, then, which
   Christ lost? It was the sense and actual comfort of his Father's love,
   the want of a sensible consolation, those effects of joy and solace
   which he used to have.. Now, this was a very grievous loss to Christ.
   He complaineth of it. The disciples were fled, his friend and lover was
   afar off, but he doth not complain of that: Disciples, why have ye
   forsaken me? Peter, why hast thou denied me?--but, My God, my God, why
   hast thou forsaken me?' It was a greater loss to Christ, because it was
   more natural to him to enjoy this comfort and solace than it can be to
   any creature. To have a candle put out, is no great matter; but to have
   the sun eclipsed, who is the fountain of light, that sets the world
   a-wondering. Christ, as God-man, had more to lose. We lose drops; he an
   ocean. The greater the enjoyment, the loss or want of it is the
   greater.

   [3.] He knew how to value the comfort of the union, having a pure
   understanding, heavenly affections, excellent contemplations. God's
   children, that have tasted of his love, if anything of it be shed
   abroad in their hearts, they would not part with it to gain the world.
   They know how to value it, and so none are so sensible of the loss of
   it as they. Now, Christ was best able to apprehend the worth of
   communion with God, having such a clear understanding, and such tender
   affections.

   [4.] So near an interest and relation to God: Prov. viii. 30, I was by
   him as one brought up with him; I was daily his delight, rejoicing
   always before him;' Col. i. 13, he is called his dear Son.' Creatures
   that have any interest in God, how mournfully do they brook his
   absence! As Mary Magdalene: Woman, why weepest thou?' They have taken
   away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.' She sought for
   Christ, and found a grave.

   [5.] Christ's trouble was more than a believer's, because it was to be
   satisfactory. Our desertions are for trial or correction; his from
   vindictive justice, and the revenging hand of God for our sins, that
   met on him: Isa. liii. 6, The Lord laid on him the iniquities of us
   all.' He was forsaken for a time, that we might be received for ever.

   2. There is something positive, or the apprehension of his Father's
   wrath, which he was to undergo for man's sins. There is the trouble of
   a guilty conscience, that is proper to the sinner himself; and there is
   a penal disturbance, which was found in our surety. He was to stand in
   the sinner's stead, and the great burden of sin he was to undergo was
   an amazement to him that had such a delicate and tender spirit as
   Christ had: Mat. xxvi. 38, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto
   death.' He was sore amazed,' Mark xiv. 33. He had his fears.' Heb. v.
   7. The effects were sensible in his bloody sweat. These were a part of
   that fire in which our sacrifice was to be roasted. It was not the fear
   of temporal death that caused these agonies. Christ had not a childish,
   womanish spirit; not to say anything of the fortitude of the martyrs,
   many of whom kissed the stake, and thanked the executioner. And we see
   in malefactors what a courage and stubbornness men of a stout heart
   will put on. No; it was the apprehension of his Father's wrath, which
   he was to undergo for man's sin, when made a curse for us,' Gal. iii.
   13. We have slight thoughts of sin, and the wrath of God deserved
   thereby; but Christ had other thoughts of it. When God cometh to deal
   with him in our stead, we, that know not the power of God's anger, are
   not affected with it. But when the Father shall fall upon him with all
   his weight, this was properly the travail of his soul: Isa. liii. 10,
   It pleased the Father to bruise him: he hath put him to grief.'

   Hence learn:--

   1. The heinousness of sin. You see it is no easy matter to reconcile
   sinners to God. It cost Christ a life of sorrows, and afterwards a
   painful, shameful, and an accursed death; the loss of actual comfort,
   and a terrible feeling, or an amazing sense of the wrath of God. We
   jest and sport away our souls, but Christ found it hard work to save
   them, and recover them to God. Surely they that sin freely in thought,
   and foully in act, have low thoughts of the blood of Christ. You count
   it common blood: Heb. x. 29, And have counted the blood of the
   covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing.' When you make
   it a light thing to sin, you do in effect say so. When a precious
   vessel cannot be mended or repaired but with the cost of a thousand
   pounds, you would be careful how you break it. You slight the
   sufferings of Christ when you break with God for every trifle. Is it
   nothing for the Son of God to come down from heaven to die for poor
   sinners? He calleth to you, Behold, all ye that pass by, is any sorrow
   like unto my sorrow?' Is it nothing to offend your heavenly Father, and
   to lie under the burden of his displeasure? By his dealing with his
   dear Son, substituted into the room and place of sinners, God would
   convince all wicked and hard-hearted sinners what it is to break his
   commandments. Dare you, after all this, to go on pleasingly and
   delightfully in an evil course, as if God made a small matter of our
   sins? Now he is satisfied for them by a Mediator.

   2. Learn hence the terribleness of God's wrath. It put Jesus Christ
   upon dying, yea, upon much travail of soul. Christ knew before all that
   he was to suffer, and yet he is amazed when it came upon him. Many roar
   upon their death-beds when the anger of the Lord breaketh in upon them
   like an armed man. They never thought of their danger before, and were
   not prepared for it; but Christ knew it before. Besides, Christ had no
   personal guilt to weaken his strength; you have wounded consciences.
   Christ had all graces in him to the height; but you have none or little
   patience and fortitude. Christ was God-man, you are poor creatures.
   Christ knew what glory his sufferings would bring to God, what good to
   man; and yet he feareth what he was to undergo; and Christ knew they
   would be short, yet he prayeth, Father, save me from this hour:' but
   yours are to endure for ever. The Lord Jesus is lifted up as a sign of
   salvation to them that trust in him, and is a pledge of what shall
   light upon the wicked to all eternity--an instance to all others of'
   God's wrath. God will make you see what it is to lie under his wrath.
   If a spark of it light upon the conscience, what a burden is a man to
   himself!

   3. We learn hence the greatness of our obligations to Christ, that he
   willingly condescended to endure such hard and bitter things for our
   sakes. He would be deserted and submit to soul-troubles; he knew well
   enough what it would cost him, yet he willingly undertook the business:
   Ps. xl. 7, 8. Then said I, Lo, I come; in the volume of the book it is
   written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is within my
   heart.' Divine justice is there introduced proposing its demands: Son,
   you must take a body and suffer in it. Man's blood is tainted, and you
   must be formed in fashion like one of them, and stand before me in
   their stead. You must expect to be tempted by the devil, hunted and
   baited by men,--to be responsible to my justice, to bear my wrath, and
   to be handled as if you were the sinner in law. And Christ said, Heb.
   x. 7, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God;' I am satisfied and well
   pleased with the terms. Oh! woe unto us, if after all this we should
   slight Christ, and will not come at him, though it cost us travail of
   soul. To pray, wait, meditate, is tedious, and to break our hard hearts
   we are hardly brought to; yet how willingly and readily did Christ
   undergo all his sufferings for our sakes!

   4. We learn hence what reason we have to be willing to suffer any thing
   for Christ, and to yield obedience to God at the dearest rate. We are
   called upon in the gospel to take up our cross and follow Christ, and
   when he invited us first to engage with him, he gave us warning of it;
   yet most men hope to shift well enough for all this, and are not
   troubled, and out of the impatiency of the flesh repine when it cometh
   really and actually to their share to take it up and bear it.
   Certainly, in the general, we should not desire a better lot than
   Christ himself had; for the disciple is not above his Lord: If they
   have persecuted me, they will persecute you also,' John xv. 20. He
   stooped to more than ever we were or shall be put to. But, in
   particular, we should be as willing to suffer for his sake as he for
   ours. He left the bosom of his Father to suffer for you, and will not
   you leave the bosom of your dearest relations to surfer for Christ?
   There is a great disproportion between the persons, and his sufferings
   and ours. Christ suffered as an evil-doer, and we surfer for
   well-doing; otherwise, it is the cross of Barabbas, not of Christ. His
   name was rent and torn with reproaches; and though he never did
   anything worthy of blame, yet he bore the taunts of the world, as well
   as the curse of God that was due for our sins, and suffered not only in
   his person, but in his name and reputation, and foul crimes were
   unjustly laid to his charge. It is an honour to suffer for Christ, and
   for his interest, and can be no disgraceful thing. He was the innocent
   Son of God, completely just and righteous--not only as God, but as man,
   being wholly freed of that original contagion wherewith others that
   come of Adam are defiled, Luke i. 35; fully conform to the law of God,
   both in heart and practice, Mat. iii. 15; and by just deserving lovely
   in the eyes of God and men, for he did all things well. But we, how
   innocent soever of those things which the world chargeth upon us, yet
   we are faulty before God, and cannot altogether justify ourselves
   before men. And so far as God's hand is in our troubles, we must keep
   silence. Therefore, in the sense of our sinfulness in other things, we
   should the sooner submit: Micah vii. 3, I will bear the indignation of
   the Lord, because I have sinned against him.' Again, he hath taken the
   sting out of our sufferings, and borne all the wrath due for our sins.
   Our crosses are not a satisfaction to his vindictive justice; he is but
   trying our sincerity, not pursuing his vengeance upon us. And we have
   our comforts allowed us; his were suspended. In short, since he endured
   the anger and wrath of God for us, shall not we endure the anger and
   wrath of men for his sake? So that, upon the whole matter, our
   murmuring and impatience under the cross show that we have not a due
   sense of Christ's sufferings, but too slight a value of them.

   The next thing offered in this scripture is the certainty of success.
   He shall see; that is, enjoy, receive the fruits of it. The prophet
   speaketh of some that travail in vain; as if they went but with the
   wind: Isa. xxvi. 18, We have been with child, we have been in pain, we
   have as it were brought forth wind.' And of others we read, that when
   the child came near to the birth, there was not strength to bring
   forth, Isa. xxxvii. 3. But the fruits of this travail should be a
   plentiful harvest of souls, or a numerous issue of believers begotten
   unto God.

   Doct. That Christ will infallibly, and without miscarrying, obtain the
   end of his death.

   What was the end of his death?

   1. The salvation of all such as belong to the election of grace. Christ
   died not at uncertainties, nor laid down his life at a venture, that
   some might be saved if they would; but his intention is fixed. He laid
   down his life for his sheep,' John x. 17; for his church.' Eph. v. 26;
   for his people.' Mat. i. 21. These expressions are exclusive; these,
   and not all.

   2. He effects and procures the conditions by which this salvation is
   brought about:--

   [1.] In effectual calling.

   [2.J By final perseverance.

   [1.] Effectual calling. Christ died not only to procure privileges for
   us, but to purchase faith and repentance: Acts v. 31, Him hath God
   exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a Saviour, to give
   repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins;' Heb. xii. 2, Looking
   unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that
   was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set
   down at the right hand of the throne of God;' and Heb. xiii. 21,
   Working in you what is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ;'
   Phil. i. 29, For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only
   to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake,' uper Chri'stou,
   that is, upon Christ's account. He merited faith and holiness for us.

   [2.] Final perseverance. He is both the author and finisher of our
   faith: John x. 29, My Father, who gave them me, is greater than all,
   and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand;' Heb. x. 14,
   For by one offering he perfected for ever them that are sanctified,'
   i.e., set apart for God. He hath made them fully and perfectly happy.

   But briefly to show why Christ cannot miscarry in his ends from the
   eternal covenant: Isa. liii. 10, When thou shalt make his soul an
   offering for sin, he shall see his seed.' Look to the undertaking of
   the Father and the Son, and the salvation of the elect is secured; both
   are intimated in that phrase of being given to Christ: John xvii. 6,
   Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.' All souls were God's in one
   sense; now they are given to Christ two ways:--

   1. By way of reward: Ps. ii. 8, Ask of me, and I will give thee the
   heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
   thy possession.'

   2. By way of charge; and of this charge Christ is to give an account:
   John vi. 37, 38, All that the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and
   him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out: for I came down
   from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent
   me.' And they not only may, but they shall come: John vi. 39, And this
   is the Father's will, who hath sent me, that of all that he hath given
   me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last
   day.' Otherwise Christ would lose part of his reward and part of his
   charge: Heb. ii. 13, Behold I and the children whom thou hast given
   me.'

   Use. Is to persuade us to wait for this power, and observe how the
   whole good pleasure of his will is fulfilled in us. Doth your salvation
   thrive and prosper in the hands of Christ? Do you come on kindly in a
   way of faith? You seek to put your Redeemer to shame,--to hinder Jesus
   Christ of the fruit of his travail, when you are vain, and careless,
   and obstinate. As a moral agent, so all his travail may be in vain,
   though not as Mediator. He complaineth as a minister of the
   circumcision: Isa. xlix. 4, Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I
   have spent my strength for nought and in vain; yet surely my judgment
   is with the Lord, and my work with my God.' When a people that have the
   means of grace will not be reclaimed, they seek to rob Christ of his
   purchase, and to make all his labour of love to be in vain. Christians
   are co-workers with God: We therefore, as workers together with him,
   beseech you to receive not this grace in vain,' 2 Cor. vi. 1. Oh, when
   shall Christ be formed in you? There is travailing in pain till that be
   done, Gal. iv. 19. Will you be shut out from the blessing?

   Use 2. Here is comfort to God's elect, and an engagement to make your
   election sure. How shall we know it? Do you ratify God's decree by your
   consent? Consecration answereth giving by way of reward, and committing
   by way of charge.

   1. Consecrate and set apart yourselves for the use and service of the
   Lord: Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
   God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
   to God, which is your reasonable service.' Employ what ever is bestowed
   upon you for his glory; live according to his will: Ps. cxix. 94, I am
   thine, save me.' Lord, I would not be my own, unless I be thine. Thus
   we should do when God seemeth to put us off.

   2. Commit yourselves to him in well-doing, and in the course of your
   obedience venture your souls in Christ's hands without trouble: 2 Tim.
   i. 12, For I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is
   able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day;' 1
   Peter iv. 19, Commit the keeping of your souls to him in well-doing, as
   unto a faithful Creator;' Ps. xxxi. 5, Into thy hands I commit my
   spirit, for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.'

   I come to the third thing in this scripture, and that is the
   satisfaction Christ took in the salvation of men; it was that which
   gave him full content for all his pains and travail: He shall see of
   the travail of his soul and be satisfied.' The gaining and recovering
   of lost sinners was a great satisfaction to Jesus Christ: John iv. 34,
   Christ saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me,
   and to finish his work.' When the disciples asked him whether he had
   eaten anything, it was satisfaction enough to him that he had gained a
   soul. See Luke xv. 5, And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his
   shoulders, rejoicing.' He rejoiceth at the return of a poor wandering
   sinner; after all the refusals of grace, and despising of offers,
   Christ is glad if he may at length get him home to himself. It is a
   welcome work to Christ to carry home his lost sheep upon his shoulders.

   Doct. That Jesus Christ taketh an infinite contentment and satisfaction
   in the salvation of sinners.

   I shall give you--(1.) Evidences of it; (2.) The reasons of it.

   1. For the evidences:--

   [1.] Christ pleased and entertained himself in the thought of it before
   the world was: Prov. viii. 31, Rejoicing in the habitable parts of the
   earth, and my delights were with the sons of men.' But why the
   habitable parts? The inhabitable are also the work of God's hands.
   There are objects of wonder--there is the great leviathan, and there is
   the sun, moon, and stars; but no men there with whom he was to dwell,
   or whom he was to save. Next to the complacency he took in God the
   Father, this was the delight of Christ, that he should come into the
   world and recover a people to himself.

   [2.] This was the end and aim of his coming into the world; and it is
   pleasant when a man hath attained his end, especially if it be greatly
   desired and much laboured for. For delight is according to the degree
   of the desire and labour.

   (1.) Desires: Luke xii. 50, I have a baptism to be baptized with, and
   how am I straitened till it be accomplished!' Luke xxii. 15, With
   desire have I desired to eat this passover;' that was immediately
   before his death. And it is remarkable, when Peter dissuaded him from
   suffering, Christ rebuked him with the same words that he did Satan
   tempting him to idolatry: Mat. xvi. 23, with iv. 10, He turned and said
   unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan.'

   (2.) Labour. According to the labour in the means, so is the joy in the
   end: God hath made me forget all my toil,' saith Joseph, Gen. xli. 51,
   when advanced after all his hardships and sorrows; Ps. cxxviii. 2, Thou
   shalt eat of the labour of thine hands, and happy shalt thou be.' These
   were the wished, longed, laboured-for fruits of his mediation: no such
   sorrows as his sorrows, therefore no such satisfying joys; things that
   are the purchase of his blood--things dearly bought, are highly prized.
   Rachel is brought in mourning because she had a son in sorrows, Jer.
   xxxi. 15; John xvi. 21, A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow,
   because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child,
   she remembereth no more her anguish for joy that a man is born into the
   world.' This was Christ's travail, and the end that he pursued the
   salvation of poor, lost, and undone sinners.

   [3.] Now, in heaven it is his rejoicing to see the work thrive: Luke
   xv. 7, Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth;' and ver.
   10, There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
   that repenteth;' that the lost sheep is found, and the lost son
   returned: John xv. 11, These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy
   might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.' There is our joy
   and Christ's joy; these are distinct things, joy in us and for us. It
   is not only matter of rejoicing to us to be taken to grace, but a
   rejoicing to Christ. When he seeth the gospel prevail, when sins are
   pardoned, hearts are sanctified, their spirits comforted, he is more
   pleased in this, and rejoiced in this than you can be, when he heareth
   in heaven and knoweth how it is with your souls on earth.

   [4.] When he shall come from heaven to judge the world, oh, with what
   triumph and rejoicing will he come, when he shall deliver up the
   kingdom to the Father! 1 Cor. xv. 24; Heb. ii. 13, Behold I and the
   children which thou hast given me.' He will present them and show them
   to God as the fruit and proof of his death. See what joy and rejoicing
   Paul had as a subordinate instrument: 1 Thes. ii. 19, For what is our
   hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of
   the Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?' They are the fruit of his
   ministerial labours. Paul had not such an interest in them as Christ
   had; the main virtue came from his death.

   But to determine the point, what this contentment and satisfaction is
   negatively and positively:--

   1. Negatively. It is not only that complacency which God taketh in acts
   of grace and mercy: Micah vii. 18, He delighteth in mercy.' It is a
   native act. Justice is as natural to God as mercy; yet the exercise of
   justice in a punitive way presupposeth a foregoing act of ours; and the
   due desert of the creatures' punishment is wrested and extorted from
   him, and therefore called his strange work.' Isa. xxviii. 21: but
   mercy, like live honey, droppeth of its own accord; the exercise of it
   is more pleasing to him: Lam. iii. 33, He doth not afflict willingly,
   nor grieve the children of men.' It is not from his heart; for when the
   rod is in his hand, tears are in his eyes; but, on the other side, Jer.
   xxxii. 41, I will rejoice over them to do them good, with my whole
   heart and whole soul.' It is an act most suitable to the nature of God,
   which goeth before, and is done without any regard to the creatures'
   desert; this is part of it.

   [2.] It is not only that complacency which he taketh in the holiness of
   his people. In the holiness of his people there is amor benevolentiae,
   a good-will and happiness to the unconverted; and there is amor
   placentiae, his delight in them as they are holy, because of the
   suitableness of their nature: Isa. lxii. 4, 5, Thou shalt be called
   Hephzi-bah, for the Lord delighteth in thee. And as a bridegroom
   rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.' When we
   are drawn into a near relation to God, there is another love, for we
   are in another state; and Zeph. iii. 17, He will rejoice over thee with
   joy, he will rest in his love.' His love putteth a comeliness upon his
   people,--there is the ground of God's delight. So, for their
   prosperity, it is said, Ps. xxxv. 27, Let the Lord be magnified, which
   hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.' He is glad to see when
   they are holy, and when they do well.

   2. Positively. The formality of the expression implieth more: he is
   satisfied, he accounts our well-being a sufficient recompense for all
   his pains, and all the travail of his soul well bestowed, though he
   hath been at that expense for it. It is natural and kindly for a good
   man to do good, and to rejoice in others' good. But now for Christ to
   count it a saving bargain, if with the expense of his all he may
   promote the welfare of others; this is the delight and the contentment
   here spoken of. Christ did not reckon of the charges, so he might gain
   sinners to God.

   The reasons of the point:--

   1. Because this was his work, his personal work; every person of the
   Godhead is refreshed in his work. God the Father, his personal work is
   creation,--the first mercy we received, and so proper to the first
   person. Now, it is said, Exod. xxxi. 17, In six days the Lord made
   heaven and earth, and on the seventh he rested and was refreshed;' not
   in point of weariness, but in point of delectation. It was a
   refreshment to God the Father, to see all the creatures disposed into
   their apt cells and places, as the fruit and effect of his goodness,
   wisdom, and power. He delighted himself in the survey of his work. So
   God the Spirit is grieved with the resistance and opposition he meeteth
   with in our hearts, Eph. iv. 30, but gratified and delighted with our
   obedience to his sanctifying work. And likewise the second person, when
   he seeth of the travail of his soul, what a numerous in crease ^his
   death will bring in, he is refreshed and satisfied. Christ hath his
   rest as God hath his rest: he took great complacency and delight in the
   salvation of poor sinners, as the fruit of all his labours.

   2. His love was the cause of all: his love to the Father, and his love
   to the saints.

   [1.] His love to the Father, to see him fully glorified. When Christ
   came into the world, it was sung by the angels: Luke ii. 14, Glory to
   God in the highest, on earth peace, good-will towards men;' John xiii.
   31, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.' Our
   comfort is not only concerned in the salvation of the elect, but God's
   glory. He would have been but half discovered to the world if we had
   only been created and not redeemed: we should have known but half his
   goodness, for that goodness which was manifested in creation was in
   order to some other thing. God did not create us merely that he might
   create us, but that he might communicate himself to us, and manifest
   more of his glory, and that we might see more of his wisdom, and
   goodness, and power. These were in part discovered in making the world,
   but much more in the gospel: there is much of his wisdom seen in making
   the creatures, but much more in the mystery of redemption, in bringing
   God and man together--justice and mercy together, which the angels
   desire to look into,' 1 Peter i. 12. We see his power in making us out
   of nothing, in dissolving the works of the devil, loosing the bands of
   death, raising the dead. His goodness is seen in giving the world, in
   giving Christ, in giving eternal life. Christ saith in love to his
   Father, I am satisfied; I see it will be a way wherein the glory of God
   will be much promoted.

   [2.] Love to poor lost sinners.

   (1.) They are dearly bought: they are his own; and having loved them so
   as to buy them, he will love them to the end. The saints are the
   purchase of his blood, and therefore they are called the purchased
   possession,' Eph. i. 14. Things dearly bought are much esteemed and
   valued. The church, which he hath purchased with his precious blood, he
   paid dear for it--expended his royal blood for it. The Lord Jesus
   forgets all his agonies and sorrows, because this was it he travailed
   for, and the end which he pursued.

   (2.) They are his own, his interest is concerned in them: John xvii. 6,
   I have manifested thy name unto the men thou gavest me out of the
   world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me.' He hath not only
   undertaken a charge concerning them, but received them as a reward at
   the hands of God: John xiii. 1, Having loved his own.' Propriety
   endeareth a thing. They are his, and therefore his heart is made glad
   when they thrive and do well--when his work doth prosper in their
   hands. He is the owner of the saints; and as a man is dissatisfied when
   his bargain turneth to no good account, so is Christ when you do not
   grow in grace and make a daily progress in your heavenly journey.

   Use 1. Let us consider our obligations to Christ. It was wonderful love
   that the Son of God should lay aside his glory and willingly come down
   from heaven, and undertake the business of our salvation. He needed us
   not; God was alone from all eternity, and yet happy from all eternity,
   when there was nothing besides his divine majesty. If he had any
   happiness by making the world, he might have made it sooner; he wanted
   not us, we are of no worth to him. What can we, that are less than the
   dust of the balance, contribute to the perfection of our Redeemer? yet
   that he should take pleasure in our welfare, and count himself
   satisfied, so we may be saved! Oh, the greatness of this love! How
   shall we answer it but by loving Christ again, by imitating him? Let us
   be satisfied in Christ; let it be enough to allay our cares, and fears,
   and worldly distractions, that we have an interest in him. Say with the
   psalmist: Ps. lxxiii. 25, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is
   none on earth that I desire besides thee.' Let this draw us from
   outward comforts and worldly satisfactions: if Christ did so much for
   you, that are not worth the having, oh, how should your souls be
   satisfied in him! The merchant sold all for the pearl; but what doth
   Christ get by us creatures, of us sinners? We can give a reason of our
   love to Christ, because of his excellency and our obligations to him:
   Cant. vi. 9, 10, My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the choice
   one of her that bare her: the daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea,
   the queens and the concubines, and they blessed her. Who is she that
   looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and
   terrible as an army with banners?' But Lord, what is man that thou
   regardest him? and the son of man that thou makest account of him?' Let
   all worldly contentments be as nothing to you, so you may win Christ,
   Phil. iii. 8. And when you have him, you should say, It is enough. He
   that hath God for his portion may say with the psalmist, Ps. xvi. 5, 6,
   The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
   maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen to me in pleasant places; I
   have a goodly heritage.'

   Use 2. It is a ground of comfort in the work of faith. We may plead
   with you not only from your own interest, but from Christ's
   contentment: he hath chidden many for not coming, but never any for
   corning to him. Nay, in point of gratitude, thou hast long grieved the
   Spirit of God with thy stubbornness and impenitency, taking liberty in
   fleshly delights, and running after vanity and folly. Oh, come now, and
   make glad the heart of thy Redeemer! When Isaac longed for savoury
   meat, a profane Esau would take his bow and arrows and go and kill. Go
   and try how thou canst mourn over an unbelieving heart, what thou canst
   do in compliance with Christ's desire. So, in point of hope, when he
   seeth you begging pardon, you speak to his very heart; he will join
   issue with you, and sue out the fruit of his labour. He rejoiceth in
   our justification and salvation. It will be accomplished by his desire
   and contentment.

   Use 3. It giveth ample encouragement to faith to come to Christ. It
   maketh his heart joyful when you come; the Lord Christ counteth it
   worth all his pains. People question Christ's willingness; would any be
   against their own joy and satisfaction? You have high thoughts of an
   interest in Christ, and Christ hath high thoughts of our interest in
   him; and therefore the saints plead it reciprocally: Ps. xlii. 5, Why
   art thou disquieted, O my soul? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet
   praise him for the help of his countenance.' They speak to their own
   hearts. Again, Ps. cxix., I am thine; save me.' It is your gain, and
   yet Christ counts it his joy. Why should we stand back, when Christ
   crieth earnestly to us? Mat. xi. 28, Come unto me, all ye that are
   weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Pray come; he chideth
   earnestly for not coming: John v. 40, Ye will not come unto me, that
   you may have life.' But he never chid you for coming. It is hard to
   distinguish whether Christ be more willing to take the soul, or the
   soul to take Christ. We cannot desire it more than Christ will delight
   in it. If you are afraid of seeking self in it, consider it would not
   be for your contentment but Christ's; when he seeth the travail of his
   soul he is satisfied. Your souls are enough to him. You are vile
   creatures. It is no matter; your Spouse thinketh it worthy of all his
   pains and entreaties to gain a daughter of light into his embraces;
   your comfort is his privilege.

   Use 4. It yieldeth fuel to increase the flame of love. There are three
   circumstances offered here as matter of this divine fire:--The
   impatiency of his desires; the painfulness of his endeavours; and the
   sweetness and fulness of his contentment, intended for the good of our
   souls.

   1. The impatiency of his desires. The whole life of Christ was but a
   thirst after our good, spent in the heat of love and desire. And when
   he died, he said, John xix. 28, I thirst.' No doubt, in such agonies,
   his natural moisture was turned into drought; but especially it was a
   thirst after the good of souls, the good of the creatures; it was a
   thirst that the prophecies might be fulfilled. Paul, that had the
   Spirit of Christ by measure, see what longings he expresseth: Gal. iv.
   19, My little children, of whom I travail in birth again till Christ be
   formed in you.' This was but a taste, a drop of what was in Christ.
   Phil. i. 8, For God is my record, how greatly I long for you in the
   bowels of Christ.' All Paul's longings were but a glimpse or specimen
   of those bowels in Christ. The impressions upon his spirit were more
   pure and powerful.

   2. The painfulness of his endeavours, such as could not be expressed by
   a lower term than the travail of his soul; and do but remember all the
   hardships of Christ's life, the woes of the garden, all the conflicts
   and assaults of hell upon his spirit; you shall see Christ's love did
   not dwindle in a wish, nor die away in a cold desire. The sparks of the
   creature's love may soon languish, but Christ's love did not leave him
   till it got him out of heaven into the womb, from the womb to the
   wilderness, to the garden, to the cross, to the grave. All these waters
   could not quench it. The apostle expresseth the common acts of the
   creature's love by labour: The labour of love.' Heb. vi. 10. But here
   was higher labour in the utmost degree, yea, travail: He shall see the
   travail of his soul.' Paul maketh it an endearing circumstance: 1 Thes.
   ii. 9, Ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail, labouring night
   and day.' But what was it for Paul to part with his allowance, when
   Christ parted with his glory? Well, then, consider it was no lazy love,
   no idle wish, but such as ended in restless endeavours for your good.
   There are pains on the cross, and pains in his spirit.

   3. The sweetness and fulness of contentment. Still the Lord went on
   till he took the last sour draught of vinegar; then he said, It is
   finished,' John xix. 30. Christ's spirit was restless, but then
   satisfied; it was enough if he could gain souls. O vile wretches that
   we are, that God should think our souls enough! Alas! what can we bring
   to him that Jesus Christ should set up his rest in the good of our
   souls? The merchant sold all for a pearl; but alas! we are but an ill
   purchase. What doth Christ get by us so as to be satisfied when he
   gaineth sinners?

   Use 5. It holdeth forth a high pattern for our imitation.

   1. To ministers. All the toil and travail of Christ's spirit was to
   gain souls, and he thought that a good purchase. He did not mind other
   things but for our good; heaven, that we might be glorified in his
   glory. He was head over all things, that he might be so to the church;
   otherwise he did not mind dignities and honours. Oh that our spirits
   did act thus purely, that we would not drive on a selfish design in
   such a weighty calling! God's work must be done to God's ends. Oh that
   the joy of our hearts might be the good of souls, and not a thriving in
   our own concernments: 3 John 4, I have no greater joy than to hear that
   thy children walk in the truth.' Oh, that should most affect our
   spirits! Many mind the gain, but not the soul, and rather oppose grace
   than further it; and as the dragon sought to devour the man-child, so
   they to nip the early blossoms of grace.

   2. To all. If Jesus Christ seek you, that are not worth the having, oh,
   what should you do to serve him, who is all desire, as the spouse
   calleth him, Cant. i. 16, enough to invite me and others!

   [1.] Desire him: Ps. lxxiii. 25, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and
   there is none on earth that I desire besides thee.' Christ, that had no
   need of you, thirsted after you; and who would not but pant for Christ?
   Disclaim, all other things, they are nothing to his gain. What is it,
   so I may win Christ? Phil. iii. 8, all is nothing, all is but dung and
   dross. Who would leave the pearl of price, to trade for dung?

   [2.] Pursue hard after him. The Lord Christ sought you with bruises in
   his body and travail in his soul; and will you begrudge him an hour in
   duty, a little time in prayer? When Augustus refused the petition of
   one of his soldiers, he told him, I did not serve you so at the battle
   of Actium: so may Christ say to us. Though you gain him by meditation,
   prayer, hearing, great endeavours against the unbelief of your souls;
   though you search for him about the city as the spouse doth, Cant. v.
   2, which is spoken in allusion to Jerusalem, where God was worshipped
   in his ordinances; though you go from duty to duty, yet still seek him;
   Christ will recompense all the endeavours that are laid out in the
   pursuit of him.

   [3.] Value him in the enjoyment. Alas! your travail is nothing to your
   gain: if Christ be satisfied, you should much more be satisfied. Say
   then, as Jacob, It is enough, I have seen Joseph;' so say, It is
   enough, I have Christ: Ps. xvi. 5, 6, The Lord is the portion of mine
   inheritance: the lines have fallen to me in a pleasant place; yea, I
   have a goodly heritage.' It is like the trade with the Indians, you
   have gold for a toy, a glass, or a bason. Therefore you may well be
   satisfied; this labour is well spent, these carnal desires well
   renounced: Oh, it is all made up abundantly above whatever I could part
   with for it. Therefore say as the psalmist, Ps. ciii. 2, Bless the
   Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,' as it is in the
   Hebrew. You may say, Here is a wonderful recompense indeed.

   By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many.

   We are now come to that clause wherein one particular glorious effect
   of God's covenant with Christ, and his obedience answerable thereunto,
   is mentioned; to wit, justification, which is here set out to us by
   most of its considerable causes. Here is the efficient cause; the
   instrumental cause on God's part, the doctrine of the gospel. On our
   part, the knowledge of God; for it may be taken either way, by his
   knowledge, or by the knowledge of him. The meritorious cause; and that
   is the satisfaction of Christ. The subject of it, many.

   The first thing that is offered to us in the order of the words is the
   instrumental cause of justification: bedaato, by his knowledge.' There
   is some little difference about the opening of this word. The
   Septuagint do plainly pervert the sense of it, while they reflect upon
   the person spoken of in this chapter, and render it thus: That God
   would show him light, and form his mind with knowledge, and justify his
   righteous servant that served many. But we need not stay upon that
   among Christians.

   1. Some take it actively, for the knowledge which he shall give out
   concerning himself, the doctrine of the gospel, which is the power of
   God to salvation, because it containeth the revelation of the
   righteousness of Christ: Rom. i. 16, I am not ashamed of the gospel of
   Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
   believeth.' And it is contradistinguished to the law, which holdeth out
   a discovery of sin: Rom. iii. 20, By the law is the knowledge of sin;'
   and so worketh wrath, as it is said, Rom. iv. 15; that is, all that we
   can get out of the law is guilt and wrath;. and that will show us that
   we are in a condition not to be justified, and the sadness and misery
   of that condition. But now the gospel, that discovereth a way of
   justification, even for the justification of sinners. By his
   knowledge;' that is, by his doctrine, by his gospel, he shall discover
   a way of justification.

   2. It is taken passively, for our apprehension of Christ; for so it may
   be rendered: By the knowledge of him shall; he justify them.' And this
   I conceive to be most proper to this place, though I cannot wholly
   exclude the other. The other without this is nothing; the gospel
   condemneth rather than justifieth, where it is not apprehended and
   embraced by faith. Christ saith, they had no sin if he had not spoken
   to them, John xv. 22;. that is, not so much sin. And it is said, John
   iii. 19, This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
   and men love darkness rather than light;' that is, the light of the
   gospel by accident proveth the cause of the greatest condemnation.
   Therefore you must take in this; and besides, the words will bear it.
   First, it must be so, for the prophet speaketh not only of a way of
   justification, but of actual justification. But then all the difficulty
   will be, why we are said to be justified by knowledge, since everywhere
   the scripture carries it for faith, and usually faith is made the
   instrument in our justification. We apprehend the righteousness of
   Christ for justification. There may be divers reasons given for the
   expression.

   [1.] Because the first radical act of faith is knowledge. There are
   three radical acts of faith--knowledge, assent, and affiance. The first
   is knowledge; by that God begetteth persuasion and confidence in the
   spirit. God dealeth in the new creation, and framing of the heart to
   his own use and service, as he dealt in the old creation and framing of
   the world. The first creature that he made was light; so in the new
   creation he shineth in upon the heart, and taketh away the natural
   blindness and folly of the spirit.

   [2.] Because it is the property of the Hebrews to count and apply all
   words of knowledge and of the understanding to such affections as are
   suitable and becoming such knowledge; so God's knowing and remembering
   of us implieth his pity and relieving, and our remembering of God our
   duty and observance of him; and in an ill sense imaginations are
   usually put for all those vicious affections following them. What the
   New Testament expresseth by lusts, the Old does by imaginations;
   because the understanding being the great wheel of the soul, the
   scripture expresseth the good or ill carnage of the soul by acts proper
   to the understanding. By knowledge is meant such an apprehension of
   Christ according as he hath revealed himself in the gospel, so as to
   close with him, embrace him, and rely upon him for salvation,
   acknowledging and relying upon Christ for justification. To all such as
   thus know him, Christ will procure a perfect absolution from all their
   sins. By one act are implied the other acts of faith, it being the
   manner of the Hebrews thus to express themselves. And therefore you
   must understand other suitable dispositions and goings out of the heart
   to Christ as will become such knowledge.

   [3.] Because it is no unusual thing in scripture to make knowledge to
   be the hand to receive the greatest conveyances of grace: 2 Peter i. 2,
   Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God,
   and Jesus Christ our Lord.' He maketh it to be multiplied, and shed
   into the heart through knowledge. So eternal life, which is the
   greatest of blessings: John xvii. 3, This is life eternal, that they
   might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast
   sent.' It is made to be a happy fruit of knowledge, even life eternal.
   The knowing of God in Christ entitleth us to it. Well, then, you see
   the reason of the expression why he saith by his knowledge.'

   I shall give you the points:--

   Doct. 1. That it is the privilege of the gospel to discover a way for
   the justification of sinners by his knowledge,' or by his doctrine; and
   you have that only in the gospel of Christ.

   Doct. 2. That faith is knowledge, or an apprehension of Christ; and
   therefore it is expressed by such a term here: the knowledge of him.'

   Doct. 3. That by faith we are justified. He saith by his knowledge, but
   he meaneth faith; such a knowledge as is affective, such apprehensions
   of Christ as cause answerable dispositions in the spirit.

   For the first of these, that it is the privilege of the gospel to
   discover a way for the justification of sinners.

   My work shall be to show you:--

   1. That by no other way, doctrine, or knowledge in the world, can this
   be done to make a sinner just before God; not by your vain pretences,
   that may serve to justify you before men, but not in the sight of God:
   Ps. cxliii. 2, Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy
   sight shall no man living be justified;' which is quoted by the
   apostle. The business is to get a righteousness that will endure the
   eye of God: Rom. ii. 13, For the hearers of the law are not justified
   before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.' That is the
   intent of that verse; that it is not appearances, but exact obedience,
   not any outward excellency and privilege, that could endear you to
   God's acceptance: Rom. ii. 11, For there is no respect of persons with
   God, bond or free, Jew or Gentile.' God is not charmed by any outward
   pomp and glory of the creatures; the wicked may be justified for a
   reward. Men are apt to prize anything that is pompous. The disciples
   showed Christ the buildings of the temple, Mat. xxiv. 1. God did not
   regard Saul for his personage, nor Jezebel for her painting, nor
   Absalom for his beauty, nor Sodom for her beauty. Not any device of the
   creatures; men and angels could not find out a way for the re-instating
   of sinners into the favour of God, and absolving them from their guilt.
   God himself seemeth to hint that he could find no other way: Isa. lix.
   16, And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no
   intercessor; therefore his arm brought salvation.' No endeavours or
   contrivance of the creature would serve the turn; our own prayers and
   endeavours, lashing and punishing others, will not serve the turn; nor
   the law, which is the chiefest thing that discovereth a way of
   justification, but not for the justification of sinners, for the making
   of a man righteous, but not for the making of a sinner righteous: if a
   man could walk up to the exactness of it, yet how should he do to
   redeem his soul from guilt, and to expiate sin? Papists fondly dream of
   a satisfaction in the creature's endeavours. Alas! all will not do: The
   law is weak through our flesh:' Rom. viii. 3; that is, we being weak
   creatures, it were impossible it should be done that way. The law in
   itself might have done it, were it not that we were sinners; and
   therefore mere doing will not serve. Doing indeed may make us less
   sinners, but it cannot make us righteous. But alas! we are weak through
   the flesh, and we cannot do anything: Rom. iv. 5, But believeth on him
   that justifieth the ungodly;' that is the circumstance that maketh it
   emphatically glorious.

   2. Here it is fully and amply done; the gospel holdeth out a clear way:
   and that it may appear to you, I shall show you what the way is, and
   prove that it must needs be a sure way.

   [1.] What the gospel doth.

   (1.) It discovereth perfect righteousness. The drift of the gospel is
   to discover this righteousness actively, for the fulfilling of the law
   passively, for the satisfying of the breaches of it. For therein is the
   righteousness of God revealed from faith.' The apostle proveth that it
   is the power of God to salvation,' for there is a righteousness to be
   found in it. For that is it which the creature wants, a righteousness
   to appear just before God: Rom. i. 21, But now the righteousness of God
   without the law is manifested.' We must be righteous, or we cannot be
   saved. Now the gospel discovereth this perfect righteousness in Jesus
   Christ; for it is by his righteousness that we are justified. And
   therefore it is everywhere called God's righteousness,' and
   distinguished from our own. Now this is done here; the wrath of God is
   pacified, and the law fulfilled by Jesus Christ,

   (2.) The gospel discovereth a way how this righteousness may be come
   ours: it is made ours by faith, and our union with Christ. When a man
   hath an interest in Christ, he is possessed of all that is in him; you
   have his righteousness, and therefore he is so often called
   Phenazidkem, [11] the Lord our righteousness,' Jer. xxxiii. 16; and
   Isa. lviii. 8, Thy righteousness shall go before thee.' You shall have
   an interest in what is his: Thy righteousness;' i.e., you have it in
   Jesus Christ.

   [2.] This must needs be a sure way, because God's ends are furthered by
   it.

   (1.) God is glorified. God would honour his justice; and whatever that
   required to be done or suffered was accomplished by Christ; God
   justifying sinners, and yet being just: Rom. iii. 26, To declare, I
   say, at this time his righteousness, that he might be just, and the
   justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.' That was the special
   attribute; mercy shineth forth from it. But the chiefest was that he
   might be just; and therefore here you have mercy and justice shining
   forth in their greatest strength and brightness.

   (2.) The creature is contented and satisfied. God, as he would glorify
   every one of his own attributes, so he would do that which was most
   satisfying and engaging to our spirits. Now this is so done that every
   doubt and scruple is answered. The creature is troubled because he
   cannot keep the law; it is kept for us: because it cannot satisfy for
   breaches, it is done for us. If our consciences be scorched with the
   wrath of God, there is the blood of Christ to quiet them; if troubled
   with fears, Christ was heard in what he feared, to allay ours.

   Use. Is by way of inference:--

   First, To exhort us to bless God for the gospel. Oh, what a mercy is it
   that such a way is found out for our returning to God! Acts xiii. 48,
   They were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord;' that is, spake
   wonderfully and affectionately of the gospel. What so good a word? If
   we had been to have satisfied the law, we had been miser able.
   Christians, we are not sensible of the mercy of being freed from the
   rigour of the law, of being justified by the knowledge of the doctrine
   of Christ. Do but consider what it would have been with us then, and
   how it is with us now.

   First, How it would have been with us then; the misery that we were in
   then by reason of the rigour of the law, which consisteth in two
   things:--

   1. The matter, what was required; such a burden as we nor our fathers
   were ever able to bear. See what kind of obedience it was that it
   requires.

   [1.] It must be full and entire, so as to take in the inward and
   outward man. The pharisees indeed did strive to lighten the law, and
   would have it only reach the outward part and external acts in worship,
   and obedience to the commanding part, and the grosser acts in the
   prohibition. But alas! our Saviour in Mat. v. showeth that it reacheth
   the least dissonancy that may be, as a glance of the eye, the roving of
   the thoughts, looking upon a woman to lust after her, and there all
   their peace is gone: Rom. vii. 14, The law is spiritual, but I am
   carnal, sold under sin.' Paul, when a pharisee, thought that the law
   was only conversant about externals, but he found it spiritual, and
   himself carnal. So Ps. xix. 7, The law of the Lord is perfect,
   converting the soul.' Man's law reacheth the body and the flesh, but
   God's law goeth to the very spirit and conscience. And alas! upon what
   miserable terms should we be with God, if this were the rule of our
   acceptance with him! A man hath some command of himself in these
   outward things, but who can guide his spirit in an even proportion to
   the law of God?

   [2.] Such as requireth the whole man, so as the soul must be exactly
   perfect in all the actings of it, or else it could not be accepted with
   God: Deut. vi. 5, Thou shalt love the Lord with all thy heart, and all
   thy soul, and all thy might.' A little failing in the intenseness of
   the spirit might make you to miscarry. The law knoweth not how to wink
   at failings; the least deadness and coldness of affection, the least
   restraint of spirit, would have been fatal to you. It doth not only
   reach the spirit, but the whole spirit, and bindeth over every faculty
   to obedience.

   [3.] It must be constant and universal, carried on without the least
   interruption to all the things of the commandments: Gal. iii. 10,
   Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written
   in the book of the law to do them.' The least deviation maketh us
   liable to the curse. So James ii. 10, Whosoever shall offend in one
   point, is guilty of all.' Though he keep the whole law, yet the breach
   of any one point maketh him guilty of the breach of all. And so all
   your endeavours would come to nothing, and be in vain; one sin would
   undo your hopes. Well, then, you that have observed the wanderings of
   your spirits, and are acquainted with your failings, oh, what cause
   have you to bless God that justification is not dispensed upon such
   rigorous terms! Otherwise you might cry out with the men of
   Bethshemesh, 1 Sam. vi. 20, Who is able to stand before this holy God?'
   when fifty thousand were smitten for the breach of a ceremony, for
   looking into the ark. Or you will be ready to say as David: Ps. cxxx.
   3, If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquity, O Lord, who should be able
   to stand?' There were no subsistence for the creature before the power
   of his wrath; and if God should deal with us upon these terms, we could
   not stand in our beings, much less be recti in curia, stand in our
   righteousness and innocency.

   2. Consider the manner how this must be done, viz., in our own persons:
   Mat. xix. 17, If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.'
   That is all we can get, the law taketh no notice of a mediator and
   common person. Adam, that had the knowledge of the whole law, had no
   knowledge of Christ. Though the law should a thousand times be
   fulfilled by another, that is nothing to us. The law requireth
   obedience in our own persons; cursed is every one. And the law is said
   to be our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. But that is the law
   ceremonial, which was but a dark gospel, and did hint Christ out of the
   elements of the ceremonies; a man might spell Christ out of them: Gal.
   iii. 12, But the man that doeth them shall live in them.' Well, then,
   out of all this you may conclude that the creature can fetch nothing
   from the law but aggravations of his misery; it is not to make us
   righteous before God, but to make us guilty: Rom. iii. 19, That every
   mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God;' Rom.
   v. 20, Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound.' You
   see then what cause you have to bless God. All that the rigour of the
   law could do, is but to make the offence more abounding in our
   apprehensions.

   Secondly, But you shall see more cause of rejoicing, O Gentiles! when
   you look upon the second thing, which is the privilege of the gospel.
   You have abundant cause to bless God that there is a way found out that
   sinners may draw nigh to God; that there is commerce between heaven and
   earth revived again: Luke v. 8, Peter said unto Christ, Depart from me,
   for I am a sinful man.' Alas! what should sinners do with a holy God,
   or stubble with everlasting burnings? When the law was pronounced,
   there were bounds about the mount, Exod. xix. 23. And when the people
   saw it, they removed and stood afar off, at the promulgation of the
   law, Exod. xx. 18. And our first parents hid themselves: Rev. vi. 16,
   They said to the rocks and mountains, Fall on us, and hide us from the
   face of him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the
   Lamb.' Therefore it is much that we may now come nigh to God.

   Secondly, We may come with confidence and joy. That which was their
   terror is our comfort, viz., nearness of converse with God: Eph. iii.
   12, In whom we have boldness, and access with confidence.' We do not
   come like malefactors to a tribunal of justice, but like favourites to
   a throne of grace. Our greatest confidence is with God: Heb. x. 22, Let
   us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith.' That we
   may be thankful, consider what is done that we may enjoy it.

   1. The gospel holdeth out a way how poor sinners may be accepted with
   God, a way wherein God will look after sinners: 2 Sam. xix. 28, as
   Mephibosheth said to David, For all of my father's house were but as
   dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among
   them that eat at thine own table.' All we were as dead men before God:
   Ezek. xvi. 6, I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea,
   I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Live.' The expression is
   doubled, because that is a notable circum stance, that God should seek
   to them twice, that he should look upon them when they were in their
   blood, that he should think of poor sinners, that could expect nothing
   but the sentence of condemnation.

   2. The gospel holdeth out a way how sinners may be made righteous. If
   we are vile in ourselves, yet we shall be glorious and comely in
   Christ: Ezek. xvi. 14, For it was perfect through my comeliness, which
   I have put upon thee;' Zech. iii. 4, I will cause thine iniquities to
   pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.' If
   thine own garments be filthy, Christ will give thee the royal robe of
   his righteousness: Luke xv. 22, Bring forth the best robe, and put it
   on him.' We have raiment out of Christ's own wardrobe.

   3. It showeth a way how God cometh to be delighted in the persons, and
   prayers, and services of poor sinners: Prov. xv. 8, The prayer of the
   upright is his delight;' Prov. xi. 20, But such as are upright in their
   way are his delight.' Alas! we do not deserve the meanest respect with
   God; as Abigail said to David, 1 Sam. xxv. 41, Let thine handmaid be a
   servant, to wash the feet of the servants of my lord;' Isa. lxii; 3,
   Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord.' Oh,
   therefore let us prize the gospel, and never leave till we have gotten
   a share in it. The corn in Egypt will not nourish us, unless we go and
   fetch it: Mark x. 49, Be of good comfort, rise, he calleth thee.'

   Doct. 2. That faith is a knowledge, or an apprehension of Jesus Christ.
   So it is called here.

   To clear and vindicate the point, and to recover it out of the hands of
   exception, observe--

   1. That the doctrine I have laid down is not convertible; for there is
   a knowledge, and there are apprehensions of Christ that are not faith;
   every faith hath knowledge, but every knowledge is not faith.

   2. The doctrine is not an adequate and absolute definition of faith;
   for there is more than knowledge in faith. There is a firm assent,
   consent, and affiance. So that the point is not exclusive of other acts
   of it, but only to show what is a most necessary and radical act of
   faith; and the sense of it will be this: In faith there is a knowledge,
   and that only because of the prophet's word here, and because knowledge
   is the most necessary and first act of faith; therefore did I put it in
   this form. So that I do not only make faith to be a knowledge, and an
   assent to the truths of the gospel, as some do, mistaking the nature of
   it; nor, with the papists, make this knowledge to be some general
   apprehension and avowing the articles of religion. But I shall show you
   by and by what kind of knowledge is here meant.

   But to determine the point, or to prove the acts of it; it appeareth
   that faith is knowledge by these hints from scripture.

   1. Because the effects and consequents of faith are given to knowledge:
   as knowledge is said to justify here, and life eternal is said to be
   through knowledge, John xvii. 3; and grace and peace' is said to be
   multiplied through knowledge,' 2 Peter i. 2. And so Luke i. 77, To give
   the knowledge of salvation to his people.' And the work of faith is
   called the knowledge of salvation.'

   2. Because the most considerable acts of faith are expressed by words
   that are proper to knowledge, and belong to the understanding; and yet
   that barely is not sufficient: Job xix. 25, I know that my Redeemer
   liveth,' for I believe.' And Mat. xiii. 23, He that heareth the word,
   and understandeth it;' that is, understandeth and believeth it. And
   Eph. i. 28, The eyes of your understandings being enlightened, that ye
   may know what is the hope of his calling.' But yet more expressly: John
   vi. 69, We believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of
   the living God.' We believe, and egno'kamen; we translate it, are sure
   that thou art the Son of the living God;' 2 Tim. i. 12, For I know in
   whom I have believed;' and that is made the ground of his committing
   his soul to him, his knowledge of God: 1 John v. 20, And we know that
   the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may
   know him.'

   3. Because there are some objects of faith that are inter
   cognoscibilia, among those things that are only to be known and
   apprehended by us according to the revelation of God. I say, all that
   faith hath to do about them, is to understand and apprehend the truth
   of them, according to the discoveries of the word; as the creation of
   the world; the making man out of nothing: and therefore the apostle
   saith, Heb. xi. 3, Through faith we understand that the worlds were
   framed by the word of God; so that the things which are seen were not
   made of things that do appear.' That was the great riddle to the
   philosophers, but by faith we understand it.

   4. Because faith is opposed to such things as imply a defect and want
   of knowledge, and therefore there is a knowledge in faith; as to
   ignorance, darkness, and folly. Therefore Paul maketh his ignorance and
   unbelief the joint causes of his rebellion against God: 1 Tim. i. 13,
   But I did it ignorantly in unbelief.' It must needs be so, if in
   unbelief. So Mat. iv. 16, unbelief is made to be a state of darkness;
   The people which sat in darkness saw great light.' Till men come to
   believe the gospel, they are under darkness. So Rom. xi. 25, the
   apostle saith, Blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the
   fulness of the Gentiles be come in.' Now the great sin of the Jews is
   unbelief, and rejecting the light of the gospel. So Eph. iv. 18, the
   state opposite to faith, or to the learning of Christ, is expressed by
   the vanity of the mind,' the darkness of the understanding,' and
   blindness of heart.' Which three expressions note vain principles,
   corrupt inferences, and want of spiritual wisdom to oversway the
   affections, and all the inclinations of the heart, into a subjection to
   the will of God.

   5. Because God's work, in reference to the begetting of faith, is
   plainly expressed to be a work upon the understanding; as by opening
   the eyes: Acts xxvi. 18, To open their eyes, and to turn them from
   darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God.' The first
   creature in the new creation is light opening the eyes, and many of
   Christ's cures were about the sight; as he dispossessed Satan, so he
   opened the eyes; for I plainly find they had a spiritual signification:
   John vi. 44, 45, No man can come unto me, except the Father, who hath
   sent me, draw him;' They shall all be taught of God.' There must be
   teaching as well as drawing; a work upon the understanding as well as
   the will. So Mat. xi. 25, there is mention made of revealing the things
   of God: a main cause of faith is this revelation. Thus it is proved.

   Secondly, To demonstrate the point, or to show why it must be so, and
   that for these reasons:--

   1. Because otherwise faith would not do its work: the work and business
   of faith is to show us things unseen to sense and reason. The apostle's
   word is ele'nchos, the force of which I shall show you by and by. It is
   to carry us within the veil, to reveal to us the things of God, such as
   Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, nor hath it entered into the
   heart of man to conceive,' 1 Cor. ii. 9; that is, such as cannot
   otherwise be discovered without this light. There is a knowledge for
   faith and in faith; a knowledge that followeth it, and a knowledge that
   maketh it up. It is ophtha'lmos tes psuches, the eye of the soul. Look,
   as sense is the light of beasts, and reason of a man, so is faith of a
   Christian. It is to guide and direct us to, and to ravish us with the
   beauties of Christ; to show us what is in our beloved more than in
   another beloved, Cant. v. 9. It is to provoke holy desires and fervent
   affections towards God. All this cannot be done without knowledge.

   2. Because there must be something done to sanctify the understanding,
   something to irradiate and enlighten the mind: grace must have
   influence upon every faculty, upon the understanding much more, for
   these reasons:--

   [1.] Because the understanding is the great wheel of the soul, and
   guide of the whole man. Usually there the business of the salvation
   sticketh: either we do not rightly apprehend Christ, or not rightly
   determine concerning Christ, and therefore we do not close with him.
   The rest of the faculties follow that same dictamen intellectus, the
   dictates and decisions of the understanding. It is with men according
   to their knowledge: the same grace which enlighteneth the mind worketh
   again to the subduing of the affections. We see men are as their minds
   are: God giveth men up first to vain minds, and then to vile
   affections, Rom. i. 28. This is the primum mobile, the great and first
   moving cause, and great wheel of the soul: Eph. ii. 3, Fulfilling the
   desires of the flesh and of the mind.' They are the wills of the mind,
   and therefore of the flesh, of the lower and more sensual soul. A
   corrupt judgment embaseth the spirit.

   [2.] Because all the great opposition against faith is from thence.

   (1.) There is great opposition against the working of faith in the
   soul. Mark a few places, and you will easily perceive it: 2 Cor. iv. 4,
   In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them who
   believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, which is
   the image of God, should shine upon them.' Satan casteth a veil of
   carnal prejudices upon the heart, so as natural men cannot see the
   beauty and glory of the gospel. There are blind minds, dark hearts,
   corrupt principles, and carnal prejudices and fleshly conceits; so that
   they scorn the truth, rather than receive it in the love of it: 1 Cor.
   ii. 14, The natural man receiveth not the things of God.' Full vessels
   can receive no more water: you cannot pour in the gospel to such
   vessels as are full of sin, and flesh, and folly; they scorn it, and
   dash it over. There are sly pretences and crafty excuses; these are in
   the understanding and the spirit, and therefore, Heb. iv. 12, the word
   is said to divide between soul and spirit;' that is, between vile
   affections and crafty pretences. There is the pretence of inability and
   unworthiness; we cannot come, and we are unfit to come. Now the light
   of the gospel showeth what is inability, and what is laziness; what is
   pride, and what unworthiness. The word discovereth all the collusions
   and jugglings of the spirit, so that we shall not easily excuse duty by
   affecting inventions to befriend affections, and so to beguile
   ourselves in these vain pleas and excuses. From all this are those
   secret persuasions and lying counsels concerning the goodness of our
   estate, the happiness of worldly comforts and pleasures, the hardships
   of the gospel, which hinder the soul from coming freely to Jesus
   Christ. Thus, you see, in the understanding is the great let to the
   begetting of faith.

   (2.) So likewise against the acting of faith, carnal counsels, false
   suggestions, corrupt reasonings in the spirit; and, therefore, the
   apostle speaketh, 2 Cor. x. 5, of casting down imaginations, and every
   high thought that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and
   bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.'
   These reasonings and thoughts are the things that are against the
   knowledge of God and the obedience of Jesus Christ. What is the reason
   men are upon such uncertainty, and terms of perplexity between Christ
   and themselves? It is through some false reasonings. We think Christ
   will not accept of us, or that we may do well enough without him. Now,
   this I take for a rule, that graces are seated in those faculties where
   there is most opposition against them; and there must be something in
   faith to sanctify the understanding, where it meeteth with such corrupt
   thoughts, carnal reasonings, dangerous persuasions, and crafty
   pretences.

   (3.) Because this is the main difference betwixt faith and presumption.
   Faith is a child of light, and presumption a child of darkness: the
   more ignorant, the more presuming. Deceits are best carried on in the
   dark: groundless conceits cannot endure the light; true faith always
   goeth upon sure grounds from the word, not upon every vain surmise:
   Rom. x. 14, How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?'
   Faith is according as we have heard out of the word. 1 Peter iii. 15,
   we are to give a reason of the hope that is in us.' Faith is rational,
   though we cannot always give a reason of the thing believed. Mysteries
   surpass reason, yet we must see a reason why we believe. Cant. v. 9,
   the spouse being asked, What is her beloved more than another beloved?'
   she gives an account of the special excellences in Christ that engaged
   her affections: My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten
   thousand.' Presumption only taketh up the name of Christ, and talketh
   of him by rote and hearsay; but there is not a distinct knowledge and
   apprehension of his excellences; they do not know any special grounds
   for their belief. Custom and common illumination furnish the tongue
   with good words. But they do not, 2 Cor. iii. 18, with open face behold
   the glory of the Lord;' that is, most nearly examine and consider the
   glorious beauties of the Lord Christ.

   (4.) To explicate the point a little more thoroughly, you will be ready
   to ask me what kind of knowledge this is? That is very necessary to be
   cleared. Of all things men will stand upon their knowledge; they will
   sooner own a fault in their morals, than a weakness in their
   intellectuals: John ix. 40, Are we blind also?' What! thinking men and
   speaking men, men of study and parts? If there be but any superficial
   apprehensions and flashy irradiations., then men are quiet; there is a
   notional light, and there is a spiritual light; and there are also
   common works and common knowledge; and there are ta echo'mena tes
   soteri'as, Things that do accompany salvation,' Heb. vi. 4, 5, compared
   with ver. 9. Every knowledge then is not the knowledge of faith; wild
   plants and garden plants have the same name and common nature, though
   they differ much in their virtues and operations. So it is here; there
   is a great deal of difference in the workings and influence of this
   knowledge. Let us a little reflect upon the differences and properties
   of true knowledge, which are these:--

   (1st.) It is considerate; it looketh to the grounds and to the nature
   of things. False apprehensions of Christ, they are hasty and
   surreptitious. Men have knowledge of the gospel, but they are loth to
   ponder and weigh the business of it in their thoughts. We may talk
   after one another like parrots, and yet never take it into our serious
   thoughts and considerations; as the apostle saith of some that taught
   the law, 1 Tim. i. 7, Neither understanding what they say, nor whereof
   they affirm.' Men talk of things by rote, after others, and out of
   books and sermons; reason of matters of which they have no spiritual
   understanding: many prophesied in the name of Christ that knew him not.
   Nicodemus, though a teacher, was ignorant of the doctrine of
   regeneration. As Aristotle observed of young men, that they attain to
   the height of mathematics, and there ponder the reason of every thing;
   but when it cometh to morals and matters that should do them good, ta
   men ou pisteuou'sin oi neoi` alla legou'si, they rather recite it by
   rote, than believe it. Men talk of the mysteries of Christ, that are
   only revealed to the saints, but they do not seriously consider with
   what disadvantages the doctrine of Christ is represented to carnal
   reason, and, on the other side, what may be the benefits of it.
   Contrary desires and carnal inclinations will not suffer us to pause on
   those things. When we begin to think on the gospel, there are
   jealousies, discontents, reluctations, and distractions: such things as
   exasperate the affections, the soul cannot easily get leave to pause
   upon. Felix had some apprehensions of the doctrines of temperance and
   judgment to come, but he could not easily bring his heart to think of
   them: Acts xxiv. 25, When I have a more convenient season, I will call
   for thee.' A man may hear the sound of music, but he is not affected
   with the melody till he hearkeneth to it. We suffer ourselves to be
   cumbered with other cares, carried aside with other desires, and
   therefore cannot stay upon these things that are most necessary, and so
   are not taken with them. It is the commendation of Mary, Luke ii. 19,
   But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.' Truths
   work with us usually when we take them into our serious thoughts. All
   false knowledge of Christ lies in trivial and slight apprehensions.
   Christ often calleth upon his disciples to let things sink into their
   hearts; then it is best.

   (2dly.) It is convincing; that is, it is such a knowledge as maketh us
   to subscribe to the truth and good of things, humbling us for former
   misapprehensions and misconceits, causing us to smite upon the thigh,
   as being thoroughly sensible of the vanity of them; and maketh the
   heart thoroughly to determine concerning them. Many men have some
   knowledge concerning the gospel, but they are not fully convinced of
   the truth of the gospel; it is mingled with much doubting, unbelief,
   error, and ignorance; they think it a vain fable, and a false or a
   fruit less doctrine, invented perhaps for a good end, to make men live
   an honest and orderly life: or at least, there is some fear that it may
   not prove true. They are not brought thoroughly to subscribe to the
   truth and worth of it: Heb. xi. 1, Faith is the substance of things
   hoped for, the evidence of things not seen;' not a knowledge, but an
   evidence, an evidencing knowledge, when the heart is made to yield to
   such discoveries, and the word is received and lodged in the heart with
   much assurance, as the apostle speaketh, 1 Thes. i. 5. They were
   convinced that it was the only good and true way. Others have only some
   conjectural persuasions, or some opinionative thoughts; they apprehend
   the gospel with a loose heart: John xvi. 9, The Spirit convinceth of
   sin, righteousness, and judgment,' ele'nxei. The Spirit dealeth by way
   of conviction, so as to overcome all gainsaying and contradiction of
   the spirit, of sin without excuses, and grace without suspicions and
   jealousies, of judgments without crafty pretences and evasions;
   conviction draweth the mind to a full consent. As Paul, when he was
   convinced, consented to the law that it was good, Rom. vii. 16; so they
   consent and yield to the goodness of the word: it is a true word, and
   the best word in the world; all former vain thoughts are gone, and the
   force of vain, carnal reasonings are broken, and the soul is brought to
   a full consent.

   (3dly.) It is a wise, a prudent, and a directive light. You shall see
   unbelief is opposed to folly, as well as to ignorance: Luke xxiv. 25, O
   ye fools, and slow of heart to believe!' Many have faith, but they have
   not wisdom. Faith is a spiritual wisdom; it is a grace that hath
   judgment in it; not only apprehension, but judgment. There is a foolish
   knowledge that puffeth up, loose apprehensions of the doctrine of the
   gospel that feed pride: 1 Cor. viii. 1, Knowledge puffeth up.'
   Knowledge goeth the wrong way when it gets up into the tongue and the
   head only. But this is a knowledge in which there is wisdom, which
   teacheth us to make the best choice for ourselves. Wisdom implieth
   something more than bare knowledge and empty speculations; it is a
   directive light, not only an idea or model of truth in our brains,
   which the apostle calleth mo'rphosin tes gnoseos, a form of knowledge,
   a platform of knowledge gathered into some compendiums or method for
   their own or others' good, able to branch out things, and talk well of
   them, a map and perfect system of all the enjoyments of the saints; for
   alas! such things may be easily learned from others' experience; but
   such a knowledge as is able to guide us in all the actings of our
   spirits, such a knowledge as aimeth at a right frame of affections. We
   shall easily discern knowledge by the ends and use of it. It is not
   merely that we may conceive distinctly of the Godhead, to better our
   art and skill, and to be able to discourse of Christ, but that we may
   glorify him, that we may honour him in our lives,--that is the end and
   the aim. Some desire to know God, as a painter desireth to know a man
   that he may take his image and likeness, and so draw his picture, and
   set it out in paint upon a table. Others know Christ as a child doth
   his father, that he may become the lively image and resemblance of him,
   that men may read their heavenly Father in their conversations: Mat. v.
   16, Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
   works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.' Not that we may
   paint out God and Christ in words, but that we may become a lively
   representation of him in our lives. Faith is wise, it doth not aim only
   at abstracted conceits of God, but to know him so as we may live by it.

   (4thly.) It is affective; that is, it is such a knowledge as, besides
   the representation of the object, leaveth an impression upon the
   affections, and stirreth up desires and delights: as Prov. ii. 10, When
   wisdom entereth upon thy heart.' The heart, in the scripture dialect,
   is the seat of the affections, of esteem, desire, and delight; it
   stirreth up affiance, and embracing of Christ and his righteousness to
   salvation, when there is heat as well as light, if it provoke
   affections and suit able inclinations, and there is a powerful sway
   upon the whole spirit. As the church saith, Lam. iii. 51, Mine eye
   affecteth my heart.' There are proportionable affections stirred to the
   apprehensions that we have of Christ; and the gospel as a light, by the
   further concurrence of the Spirit, breaketh the force of contrary
   inclinations, and causeth yearnings and languishings in the soul after
   Christ. This must be understood rightly, for the most abstract
   speculations do suppose some inclination in the soul; but it must be
   answerable. And besides, in the first work of the Spirit upon the
   heart, there is not only an enlightening, but some impressions of joy.
   The stony ground received the word with joy, Mat. xiii. There may be
   some flashes of joy in the apprehension of Christ, though it be but a
   conditional proffer, some slight apprehensions of happiness in having
   Christ, when we look upon it as a probable way for salvation, and yet
   have no interest in him. As the Jews mistook John for Christ, so many
   mistake these preparations for grace or a real work, Heb. vi. 5. This
   is called a tasting of the good word,' a causing of contentment in the
   joy the word holdeth forth. Therefore it is not to be understood by
   these flashy joys and transient glances, but by the settled and serious
   constitution of the spirit towards God, when the whole frame, stream,
   and bent of the soul goeth that way. As it is not a few thoughts and
   affections that make a man bad, but the frame and bent of his thoughts
   and affections, so here, it is not some glancing desires, or some
   slight wishes, but the general bent and delight of the spirit. Saving
   knowledge begets standing affections and gracious dispositions, that
   are as the chariots of Aminadab to carry out the soul towards Christ.

   (5thly.) It is practical, as it doth not stay in the brain, but goeth
   down to the affections; and it doth not stay there, but gets out into
   the conversation and into the actions. When men pretend to know much
   and practise little, it is a sign their knowledge is but slight and
   trivial; and it is so far from being a privilege, that it obligeth us
   to many stripes: Luke xii. 47, That servant which knew his lord's will,
   and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be
   beaten with many stripes.' There is a knowledge that doth not end in
   doing, but alas! that is but a fancied knowledge rather than true: 1
   John ii. 4, He that saith I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
   is a liar, and the truth is not in him.' Saving light and true
   apprehensions of Christ will end in practice: 3 John 11, He that doeth
   evil hath not seen God.' A true sight and apprehension of God is
   renewing and transforming; false apprehensions cannot work it:
   therefore the apostle saith: 2 Cor. iii. 18, But we all with open face,
   beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
   same image from glory to glory.' God's glory maketh us shine like
   Moses's face when he talked with God. The greater acquaintance with
   him, the more holy, and heavenly, and spiritual; the life will be
   according to the light, and the light of Christ will carry the glory of
   Christ into the heart, and make it shine out in the conversation. Like
   windows that shine in the day when the sun is risen, so we may arise
   and shine, for the glory of the Lord is risen upon us, and holiness of
   conversation is made to depend upon the clearness of the apprehension
   of Christ: Eph. iv. 2, But ye have not so learned Christ;' that is, to
   walk in such looseness as the Gentiles did. A true sight of him maketh
   us the same that Christ is.

   (6thly.) It is spiritual: I mean, such as is begotten by the power of
   the Spirit, not a taking up of reports of Jesus Christ, but a closing
   with him upon the revelation made of him; not upon the reports of men,
   but the Spirit's testimony: John iv. 42, Now we believe, not because of
   thy saying, for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is
   indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.' They would not take him
   upon the common report, but had heard his own voice; not only upon the
   belief of the church, but upon Christ's own voice, that maketh it sure
   to the soul: 1 John v. 6, And it is the Spirit that beareth witness,
   because the Spirit is truth.'

   Use 1. Serveth for information, to show us the misery of those that are
   without knowledge. Without knowledge, without faith; and without faith,
   without God, without a promise. It was a great reproach that Nahash
   would lay upon Israel, that he would put out their right eyes: 1 Sam.
   xi. 12. And the great design the god of this world hath upon the men of
   the world is to blind their eyes, that they may not come to the
   knowledge of the truth. Ignorance is one of God's sorest judgments;
   when he hath left off threatening of other things, then he threateneth
   a blind heart and a vain mind. Oh that we could be sensible of it!
   Ignorance is twofold: either--

   1, Necessary; or

   2. Negligent.

   1. Necessary ignorance, which is otherwise called the ignorance of pure
   negation, when men do not know God in Christ, because they have not
   heard of him. And it happeneth in two cases--either in the total want
   of means, or the want of due means. I shall a little examine the
   particulars, that you may not think they do not concern you, or that
   you may make this use of it, at least, to affect your hearts with pity
   and compassion towards them that want it. When Christ saw the blindness
   of the Jews, he wept over them, because the things which belong to
   their peace were hid from their eyes.' Luke xix. 41, 42. Oh, how may we
   weep over many corners of this kingdom, where Jesus Christ is not so
   much as named: Rom. xv. 2, Let every one of us please his neighbour for
   his good to edification.' And not only that, but that we may be
   sensible of our mercies, and bless God for our enjoyments. When Christ
   had told his disciples of the gross ignorance of others, he presently
   added, Mat. xiii. 16, Blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your
   ears, for they hear'! Oh, what a mercy is it that it is otherwise with
   you! So far you may reckon yourselves blessed, as you have more
   advantages of increasing your knowledge, and bettering your
   apprehensions of God in Christ. Therefore consider how ill it is with
   them that want means, or the due means. Faith cometh by hearing;' God
   dealeth with us in a way suitable to our intellectual nature, and
   beginneth with knowledge. How should they know? and yet their case is
   very sad.

   [1.] As to those that want the means. God leaveth no man without some
   witness of himself. Those that have not the word and Spirit, they have
   showers of rain and fruitful seasons; God is not wanting to them. If
   they have not those larger and clearer discoveries of God, yet their
   ignorance is deadly and fatal to them: Prov. xxix. 18, Where there is
   no vision, the people perish.' Oh, think of such unhappy times, when
   frequenting of ordinances was counted a crime, the want of which will
   be your undoing; for the apostle saith Christ cometh to render
   vengeance to them that know not God,' 2 Thes. i. 8. Men think if their
   lives be not vicious, and they have good meanings, it will be well with
   them; they are not troubled for their ignorance. I tell you, Christ
   will come in flames of fire to them that know not God, and obey not the
   gospel. A vain mind is as bad as vile affections. The blind and the
   lame, they were equally an abomination to God; and it is every way as
   dangerous to want knowledge as obedience. Oh, consider the sad state of
   such souls and places where there are no means! Our Saviour saith, He
   that knoweth not the will of God shall have few stripes;' he doth not
   say no stripes, Luke xii. 48. Ignorance will not excuse them. What a
   sorry privilege is it that they shall have a cooler hell?

   [2.] That want due means. This is as bad or worse than the former. Men
   rest in that which carrieth the face of an ordinance; and usually it is
   harder to teach them who know something in religion than those who know
   nothing at all; for a little knowledge does but prepossess the mind
   with carnal truth and prejudices, and the real truth is rejected with
   more stubbornness. Consider the sadness of such an estate. Men think to
   cause all the blame to reflect upon their teachers, they have been
   taught so; but what saith our Saviour: Mat. xv. 14, If the blind lead
   the blind, they shall both fall into the ditch.' Ignorant, misled
   people will perish with their blind guides: Isa. ix. 16, For the
   leaders of this people cause them to err, and they that are led of them
   are destroyed.' And indeed it is but just. Men make them their
   darlings, and humour them in the way of their lusts. Ill instruments
   would be cast out if cast out of the people's hearts: Jer. v. 31, The
   prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means;
   and my people love to have it so: and what will you do in the end
   thereof?' What will be the end of this? It is the property of this
   blindness to love those that do increase it. If naturally blind, we
   would have a good guide. Elymas, the sorcerer, sought for one to lead
   him by the hand, Acts xiii. 11. But oh, how sad is their case that dote
   upon their blind guides!--these are the people's idols every where.
   Thus for necessary ignorance; I mean, that which must needs be so.

   2. Ignorance that ariseth from negligence; that is, when men have means
   and do not improve them. This is sad, and increaseth the sin, when you
   have the gospel, and do not suffer it to shine in upon your souls: John
   xv. 22, If I had not spoken unto them, they had not had sin;' that is,
   not so much sin. The great aggravation of sin is from the advantages
   and opportunities you have to do better. All your privileges do but
   heighten your offence if you neglect to improve them. If you have but
   the witness of sense and reason, you are left without excuse; how much
   more when you have the word and Spirit. Christ often threateneth
   heavier judgments to those places that were privy and conscious to his
   mighty works, and more glorious discoveries, and the testimonies of his
   Godhead. Look, as it will be a great vexation to the men of the world
   at the last day, that the saints' Saviour will be their judge; so the
   gospel, the word of salvation, will become a killing word to them that
   have it preached, and yet do not benefit by it. There are divers
   degrees of this negligent ignorance, which I shall name.

   [1.] When men have not any proportionable measures of knowledge to
   their means,--men that have sat a long time under the word, and yet
   their foolish heart is darkened within them, and they know little of
   the mysteries of salvation, and scarce get rid of their natural
   thoughts and apprehensions of God; this is sad, and yet this may in
   some measure befall the people of God: John xiv. 9, Have I been so long
   time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?' Have you had so
   many conferences and sermons, and are yet to seek? Heb. v. 12, When for
   the time ye ought to be teachers of others, ye have need that one
   should teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of
   God.' After all the pains taken with them, men must still be kept to
   their milk and first rudiments, and still we must be forced to press
   you from things odious to mere nature. And when we should go up to
   spiritual evils, unbelief, resting in duties, want of making the most
   of Christ, want of communion and commerce with him; we find that we
   must deal with you about drunkenness, and surfeiting, and excess in
   sensual things, you being in the lowest form of godliness, scarce
   brought to a seemly pitch of morality, so that sublime discoveries do
   but amuse you or harden you, and are certainly lost upon you. When the
   apostle could not by all his endeavours bring them off from their
   ceremonies, he sadly complaineth, Gal. iv. 10, 11, Ye observe days, and
   months, and times, and years. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed
   upon you labour in vain.' All the choice discoveries of Christ were to
   no purpose. If they were at that pass, oh, what a sad thing it was that
   notwithstanding all the pains the apostle had taken with them, they
   would still stick at a ceremony, when there is so small a proficiency,
   that we can scarce bring them to the low things of Christianity.

   [2.] When men have some knowledge with the means, but it is flashy and
   superficial. Men do not know God as they ought to know him, as the
   apostle's word is. All their knowledge ends in speculation; their lives
   do not answer it: Titus i. 16, They profess that they know God, but in
   works they deny him.' Superficial and slender knowledge will not reach
   the heart, and go down as low as the conversation. Some are like toads,
   that have a jewel in their heads, when their whole bodies are poison;
   like the devil, that taketh Christ to the top of the pinnacle, that he
   might throw him down again. Some men have light in their
   understandings, when their conversations are foul and defiled. Oh,
   consider, mere knowledge will not profit when you know only to
   aggravate your wickedness. Quid prodest, &c. What will it profit to be
   dignified with learning and knowledge, and to perish at last? The name
   of the evil angels is daimonia, because of their knowledge; they are
   intellectual natures. The good angels know the will of God, and do it:
   Ps. ciii. 20, They do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his
   word.' Christ leadeth us to heaven for a pattern of duty: Thy will be
   done on earth as it is in heaven.' You shall find the saints of God
   drawing out their knowledge into practice, as David prayeth for it upon
   this ground: Ps. cxix. 34, Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy
   law.' That was his end, to know so as he might be guided in his way:
   Ps. cxix. 11, Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin
   against thee.' He had laid up some principles that he might argue from
   them, and draw them out to every case; and upon every temptation might
   bring out these truths, and enforce them upon his heart. It is true,
   sometimes the people of God may be too backward, and too often cherish
   an empty knowledge and naked apprehension, which the apostle calleth a
   being barren and unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ,' 2 Peter i. 8.
   They know his plenty, but do not make use of it; his comforts, but are
   not refreshed by them; his will, but do not do it. This is a being
   barren and unfruitful; but it should not be so. Therefore, bewail that
   your affections are not heated, your conversations bettered and amended
   by what you know.

   [3.] Those that have knowledge of Christ, but abuse their knowledge to
   countenance their lusts, and to defend their sins. Oh, this is sad! The
   Gnostics were so called from their knowledge, and yet were the impurest
   heretics. These are those who, as the apostle saith, Gal. v. 13, Use
   their liberty as an occasion to the flesh,' and make the knowledge of
   Christ the ground of looseness and laziness: Jude 4, Turning the grace
   of God into lasciviousness;' that is, the knowledge of the gospel.
   Carnal hearts are like the sea, that turneth everything into the nature
   of itself, even the sweet influences of heaven into salt waters. The
   learning of Christ, and the looking upon Christ, is made the great
   ground of holiness everywhere in the scripture; and they make it the
   ground of carnal liberty and a loose life: like the devil, the more
   cunning the more wicked; the more knowing, the more hurt they do to
   their own souls, and to the souls of others.

   [4.] When men grossly affect their ignorance. And this is seen in two
   things:--

   (1.) By the unteachableness of their hearts. They are not knowing or
   tractable; the plainest truths of God are riddles to them. A child of
   God may be ignorant, but a child of God cannot be unteachable. There is
   a suitableness and cognation between his spirit and divine truths;
   there is something in his heart that answereth to it, though he never
   heard it before. When God regenerates the heart, he introduceth a frame
   of truth, something that is of kin, and answer able to everything that
   is revealed. But now it is not so with wicked men; they are carried
   aside with contrary inclinations, that their spirits bear no proportion
   with truth. As the apostle saith of silly women laden with sin, and led
   away with divers lusts, 2 Tim. iii. 7, they are ever learning, and
   never able to come to the knowledge of the truth;' that is, they make
   not use of the advantages, occasions, and opportunities of learning;
   for otherwise it might be the description of a godly man; they never
   reach the uttermost truths of the spiritual life, though always
   learning. Oh, it is a sad thing this untractableness and
   unteachableness of heart! Men cannot tell what to make of divine
   things: Isa. xxviii. 9, Whom shall I teach knowledge, and whom shall I
   make to understand doctrine? Them that are weaned from the milk, and
   drawn from the breasts;' that is, he were as good go and prattle with
   poor infants as teach them. Men have unsavoury, injudicious minds that
   do not relish the things of God.

   (2.) By downright opposition, raging against the light. As the
   Ethiopians, that are said once a year solemnly to curse the sun; so
   their hearts rage against knowledge, because it reviveth guilt: Job
   xxi. 14, They say unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not the
   knowledge of thy ways.' They did not desire knowledge. This is the
   perverseness of man's nature, to love his own blindness, to refuse the
   means of helping and relieving his soul. We are not only blind, but
   mad; when we cannot keep out the light, we rage against it: Jer. xliv.
   16, 17, As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of
   the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly do what
   soever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth.' Who would not pity such
   mad persons as these? Here is the result of blindness and ignorance,
   desperate opposition against the word. They will have their old ways,
   their old principles, their old customs. Oh, the malignity that is in
   their hearts!

   Use 2. Is exhortation, to press you to get knowledge. If faith be
   knowledge, there lieth a great necessity upon you to get it. You can as
   well be without the sun in the world as without knowledge and light in
   the heart.

   1. To get knowledge. Shall I press it in the general,--the knowledge of
   divine things, and the knowledge of God in Christ?

   [1.] The knowledge of divine things in the general. And here
   consider:--

   (1.) You cannot be well without it: Prov. xix. 2, That the soul be
   without knowledge, it is not good.' Men will plead thus: We are
   ignorant, but we hope we have a good meaning: the spirit cannot be good
   without knowledge. This shows the goodness of your spirits.

   (2.) It is your excellency above the beasts: the more knowledge, the
   more manly; and the more ignorant, the more brutish: Ps. xlix. 12,
   Nevertheless man, being in honour, abideth not, but is like the beasts
   that perish.' In all communications of grace, God beginneth with the
   understanding. The perfection of man is his angelical nature: Job xxxv.
   11, Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us
   wiser than the fowls of heaven.' Common light is man's excellency, but
   to have a mind to know God distinguishes you from other men. Others may
   go beyond you in other things, but this will be your excellency, to
   know him: Jer. ix. 23, 24, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
   neither let the mighty man glory in his might; let not the rich man
   glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he
   understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord.' If you will glory,
   there is your glory. It is not who is most wealthy, or who most mighty,
   or who most wise; this is your excellency above other men, that excel
   in wisdom and knowledge. They may be able, with Berengarius, to dispute
   de omni scibili, from the cedar to the hyssop, from the highest star to
   the lowest mineral, yet yours is a better knowledge: 1 Cor. i. 20,
   Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this
   world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?' The great
   prejudice against divine knowledge is, because men do not know the
   excellency of it. The Gentiles refused the gospel, because they would
   fain be conversant about the nobler sciences, and because those would
   enrich their senses with wisdom, which they seemed to want in the
   gospel: 1 Cor. ii. 6, Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are
   perfect; yet not the wisdom of the world, nor of the princes of this
   world, that come to nought.' Oh, if you had eyes to see it, you would
   find this to be the greatest wisdom; here is your excellency.

   (3.) You cannot serve God without it. The papists say, ignorance is the
   mother of devotion, whereas it is the great hindrance of it: 1 Chron.
   xxviii. 9, And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father,
   and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind.' There is the
   method and order: first, know him, and then the heart and the will must
   follow. God doth not love blind obedience. Christ reproveth the
   Samaritans for worshipping they knew not what, John iv. 22. And Paul
   calleth it superstition in the Athenians to build an altar to the
   unknown God. Simple credulity may be very awful, and the light may work
   upon our fear, but rational service is performed most with love and
   delight.

   2. Above all things know God in Christ: John xvii. 3, And this is life
   eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus
   Christ, whom thou hast sent.' Not only to know the true God, but Jesus
   Christ, whom he hath sent. 2 Cor. iv. 6, it is said, God giveth the
   light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
   Christ.' He being the express image of the Father, there is the express
   representation of him. I am afraid Christians do not prize the
   knowledge of God in Christ so much as they should. Oh, consider, there
   you have the most comfortable representation of him: Ps. cxvi. 5, this
   is David's rejoicing, Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God
   is merciful.' Oh, that you could see both together, that is most
   beneficial. Remember it is said, by the knowledge of him,' or by his
   knowledge,' in the text. The knowledge of Christ carrieth the image of
   Christ into the soul: John i. 14, And we beheld his glory, the glory as
   of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.' And then
   in the 17th verse, Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.' All the good
   of your souls cometh this way. The more particular discoveries your
   hearts have of him, the better it is for you.

   Secondly, Grow up in the knowledge of Christ: 2 Peter iii. 18, But grow
   in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.'
   Search out more of the particularities of his love. When men think they
   have knowledge enough, they know nothing: 1 Cor. viii. 2, He that
   thinketh he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing as he ought to know.'
   You have not knowledge enough to see your ignorance: 1 Cor. xiv. 20, In
   understanding be ye men.' Do not think that you know all things that
   can be taught; you cannot so easily go through all the dimensions,
   height, breadth, depth and length.

   The means are these:--

   1. Be conversant with the word, in reading of it. Therefore it is said,
   Ps. xix. 8, The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart;
   the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.' St Austin
   calleth the scriptures his chief light.

   2. In hearing, wait upon God in it: Isa. ii. 3, Come ye, and let us go
   up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and
   he will teach us his ways.' Wait at the doors of wisdom, that God may
   cause your souls to lie under the power of truth.

   3. Pray instantly and earnestly: Jer. xxxi. 34, They shall all know me
   from the least of them to the greatest of them, saith the Lord.' It is
   his covenant promise to give understanding, therefore ask it of God.
   The blind man would not hold his peace, Luke xviii. 39-41, But cried so
   much the more, Lord, that I may receive my sight.'

   4. Meditate often upon the love of Christ, search out all the
   particularities of it. The Indian gymnosophists would all the day be
   gazing upon the beauty of the sun; oh! view the Sun of Righteousness in
   all his glorious beams and influences with more delight and pleasure.

   5. Lay aside your own prejudices and misapprehensions, for they will
   lead you aside, and you will gravel yourselves, and run into great
   uncertainties and contradictions: Job xxxii. 8, There is a spirit in
   man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.'

   By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall
   bear their iniquities.

   I shall now apply this first circumstance, the instrument, specified in
   that word by his knowledge, to the act in the other word, justify. For
   the word of the instrument, knowledge, we showed you it importeth
   faith--an effective knowledge--such as causeth the soul to embrace
   Christ, and receive him for our comfort. The other word is a little to
   be opened, and then we shall the better match these two together. To
   justify, in a scripture notion, is to absolve and acquit. It is a
   judicial and court word, and signifieth not so much to make righteous
   as to account so. The papists would have it that it signifies a
   righteousness infused, not a reckoning of the wicked as if they were
   not guilty. But the word is used otherwise, Isa. v. 23, Woe to them
   that justify the wicked for a reward, and take away the righteousness
   of the righteous from them;' Luke xviii. 14, This man went down to his
   house justified rather than the other.' To be justified, then, is to be
   acquitted before God of that condemnation and censure which we had
   deserved, and to be accepted as righteous in his sight. Well, then, the
   point from both these linked together is this:--

   That by faith we are justified; or, Jesus Christ justifieth poor
   sinners by their faith. The prophet meaneth faith, though the saith
   knowledge. For scriptures to prove the point, take these, that are full
   to the purpose:--Rom. iii. 28, Therefore we conclude that a man is
   justified by faith.' The apostle had been labouring throughout all the
   three chapters to bring the discourse to that issue; and at length
   there was the result of all, that we must be justified by faith. So
   Rom. v. 1, Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
   Lord Jesus Christ.' You see these scriptures are express enough without
   any improvement; therefore I go off to the reasons why faith, of all
   other graces, is deputed to this service.

   1. Because it is the most receptive grace, and so most fit for the
   needy condition of the creature. Other graces are more operative, but
   faith is most receptive. It is the right hand of the soul, to take in
   the fulness of Jesus Christ. Nature liveth upon alms, and the continued
   bounty and supplies of heaven, since the fall; and therefore those
   graces are most serviceable that are most receptive. Love giveth, but
   faith taketh. All God's stars shine with a borrowed light. We are
   beggars now, rather than workers. The blessing of life is not in
   ourselves, but in Christ. Faith standeth in a passive receptiveness to
   take the conveyances of grace: 1 John v. 12, He that hath the Son hath
   life; and he that hath not the Son hath not life.' It is all in having
   Christ. We must be beholden to another. God will trust us no more with
   the keeping of it, but hath placed our support in Jesus Christ. Our
   safety is like the ivy, or those weaker strings that are strengthened
   by cleaving about the oak. Now faith serveth for that, for relying on
   Christ to clothe us with his righteousness.

   2. Faith is most loyal and true to God. It giveth him all the glory, it
   looketh for all from him; therefore the apostle saith, Rom. iii. 26,
   27, The grand condition of the new covenant is faith, to exclude
   boasting. God would have everything carried in a way of grace, that if
   we glory in anything, we may glory in the Lord, 1 Cor. i. 31. Our
   boasting must be in the glorifying of grace. God honoureth those graces
   that honour him most. It is said, Rom. iv. 20, of Abraham, that he was
   strong in faith, giving glory to God;' so doth God to faith. And faith
   is most abasing; it casteth down all the excellence of the creature.
   Man had rather be doing than borrowing: we cannot endure to hear of
   going out of ourselves; therefore God ordained this grace.

   3. To make the way more sure: Rom. iv. 16, Therefore it is of faith,
   that it might be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all
   the seed.' Now things are not so floating and uncertain as when we were
   left to working graces. Now we have a sure Christ for the foundation:
   Isa. xxviii. 16, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a
   tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure foundation.' It is sure in
   Christ, and we have Christ too by a sure tenure and claim: 2 Sam.
   xxiii. 5, Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in
   all things, and sure.' We may be uneven and unconstant with God; and
   though we be so with him, yet we have a sure, unvariable promise to
   hold by. And now here is faith, that taketh a sure hold upon this
   promise: Heb. vi. 19, Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both
   sure and steadfast;' a sure faith, a sure promise, a sure Christ.
   Things are not left upon doubtful terms; God hath deputed all to faith,
   which hath a sure ground, a sure claim, and a sure hold.

   4. Because God would bring us back again in the same way that we went
   off and departed from him, that so the return might be the more
   satisfactory, that we might see the defects of nature repaired and made
   up in Christ. We went off by unbelief. Eve distrusted the truth of God,
   and therefore God will bring us about again by faith. To this day the
   heart is loosened from God by unbelief. Diffidence is the first step to
   apostasy: Heb. iii. 12, Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of
   you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.' And
   faith is a drawing near to God, even to such a degree of nearness as a
   union. We are not only made like to Christ, as by other graces, but one
   with Christ. Thus the point is proved.

   I shall now a little clear the point to you by dispatching these two
   questions:--

   First, What faith is that justifieth?

   Secondly, How it justifieth?

   First, What faith is? It is not every faith,--not a general assent 01
   loose acknowledgment of the articles of religion; but there is a faith
   which, to distinguish it from all others, is called justifying faith.
   It may be defined thus:--It is a grace wrought in our hearts by the
   Spirit, by which the soul doth rest and cast itself upon Christ,
   tendered to us in the offer of God, for pardon and acceptance. I will
   not stand examining every part of this definition, but shall endeavour
   to discover to you the nature of it by the several acts and effects of
   it, beginning with the lowest, whilst it is but a seed, as a grain of
   mustard-seed, in some small and weak beginnings, planted in the heart.
   St Mark saith, chap. iv. 31, The kingdom of God is likened to a grain
   of mustard-seed.' Very small and inconsiderable is the first work of
   grace; but we must not despise the day of small things, nor neglect the
   soft waters of Siloah. And therefore--

   First, To begin with the acts:--There are some implicit acts, and some
   explicit and formal acts. Since I am willing to give you the whole
   nature of faith, it will not be amiss to reflect upon these things.

   1. The implied acts of faith are two.

   [1.] A sight of ourselves, which faith supposeth, and the curse of God
   due to us. Man is a lazy creature, and will not apply himself to any
   religious care till he be spurred on by his need of Christ. Christ
   saith, The whole need not the physician.' Mat. ix. 12. The stung
   Israelites looked up to the brazen serpent; and those that were pricked
   in their hearts cried out, What shall we do?' Acts ii. 37. I sat alone
   because of thy hand, for thou hast filled me with indignation,' Jer.
   xv. 17. It maketh the soul sensible that it is no easy matter to
   deliver ourselves from the wrath of God. Men slight mercy till they
   need it, and are careless of the great salvation till God affect them
   with a sight of their sin and his own wrath. We are like Israel in
   Egypt, not easily weaned from the flesh-pots, till the burdens be
   doubled, and wrath presseth to anguish.

   [2.] A sense of our inability to help ourselves. Believing implieth
   that a man hath given up all his vain confidence. How should we lean
   upon Christ, whilst we fancy we have props and supports of our own to
   bear up the soul? The Corinthians did not care for Paul when they were
   full, and reigned as kings without him,' 1 Cor. iv. 8. No more do
   sinners for Christ that are full of self; they can be merry and happy,
   and keep their church, and do no harm, and all without Christ: Hosea
   xiv. 3, With thee the fatherless findeth mercy,' i.e., those that were
   destitute of all helps and supplies. Paul could not look upon Christ as
   gain till he saw the loss that was in his carnal endeavours, Phil. iii.
   8. His care to relieve his soul was a greater incumbrance to him.

   2. There are formal explicit acts of faith, and they are:--

   [1.] Knowledge of Christ, his goodness and excellency; how satisfying
   and how proportionable an object he is to the soul: John iv. 10, If
   thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that speaketh unto thee,'
   &c. The first act is an apprehension of Jesus Christ; but I have spoken
   of that largely.

   [2.] There is desire. The soul thirsteth after Christ with such a
   restless desire as will not be satisfied but with an enjoyment. It is
   compared to the panting of a chased hart: Ps. xlii. 1, As the hart
   panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.'
   In the Hebrew it is the chased she-hart, appetite in females being most
   impetuous and impatient. And it is expressed by hungering and
   thirsting: Mat. v. 6, Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after
   righteousness, for they shall be filled.' They are such voluminous and
   large desires that can in no wise endure check and restraint. Nothing
   in the world can give quiet and content to the mind possessed with
   them. The soul is sick of love for Christ, till it be stayed with his
   flagons, and comforted with his apples, Cant. ii. 5; the soul desireth
   him in the night season, Isa. xxvi. 9. And it is said, Ps. lxiii. 1, My
   soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty
   land, where no water is.' They would have him rather than all things in
   the world.

   [3.] There is a seeking of Christ, as the spouse sought her be loved,
   Cant. iii. 1-3. This is usually expressed by coining, which is one of
   the lowest degrees of faith, whilst the soul is in the way, and in the
   pursuit of Christ, but hath not fully closed with him: John vi. 35, He
   that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall
   never thirst.' He that is coming--qui se dat in viam, so Beza--shall
   never hunger nor thirst. It is like the poor prodigal returning to his
   father. Though Christ and the soul be not as yet brought to close
   together, yet the souls of believers will adventure upon Christ; yea,
   though they are not so comfortably persuaded of acceptance with him; as
   said the king of the Ninevites, Jonah iii. 9, Who can tell if God will
   turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger?' So Joel ii. 13,
   14, Turn unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow
   to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. Who
   knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him?'
   There is encouragement, a cable-rope cast out to save a sinking soul;
   though they cannot so comfortably apply Christ to their case, they are
   resolved to seek him.

   [4.] The soul resteth upon him; there is a receiving of Christ: John i.
   12, To as many as received him;' which noteth a higher degree than
   coming to him. It implieth an apprehension, and particular application
   of the promises for our use; as when the prodigal and the father were
   fallen upon each other's necks, and joined together in mutual embraces.
   It is the welcoming of Christ into the soul, the clasping him about
   with the arms of faith; as old Simeon took the child in his arms and
   said, Mine eyes have seen thy salvation.' And so the faith of the
   patriarchs is described: Heb. xi. 13, they embraced the promises.' The
   word is aspasa'menoi, they hugged and embraced promises. I conceive it
   hinteth the practice of the patriarchs, who upon every new hint of
   Christ went and worshipped; which was a testimony of the joy of their
   faith and their cleaving to Christ in the promise. And when faith is
   once come to this, it is no longer a seed hidden in the earth, but it
   springeth up in all the happy effects and fruits of it. Therefore the
   next thing I shall speak to is the effects of a justifying faith.

   Secondly, The effects of faith; there are many. I shall name those
   which I conceive to be most essential and proper; and they are of two
   sorts:--

   1. Such as concern faith itself.

   2. Other gracious constitutions of spirit.

   1. For those that concern faith itself, and they are two:--

   [1.] It is always renewing its own acts. God doth not delight in dead
   and useless habits. It is not faith that will profit us, but the
   exercise of it. God delighteth in the work of faith, that we should
   with joy draw water out of the wells of salvation.' Isa. xii. 3; that
   we should not only have faith, but act it that is, as we should make
   Christ ours, so we should possess ourselves of all that he hath, and
   that we should maintain our lives out of the supplies of his grace:
   Gal. ii. 20, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and
   gave himself for me,'--that we should not only have Christ, but live in
   him. The perfection of graces is in their acting: James ii. 22, By
   works was faith made perfect;' that is, strengthened and increased; as
   the right arm groweth stronger and full of spirits by frequent action.

   [2.] It aimeth at the increase of itself. Therefore a weak faith may
   grow into assurance. The first thing faith struggleth against is doubts
   and fears: Mark ix. 24, Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.' Graces
   are much tried by this opposition against the contrary inclinations of
   spirit. Graces in pretence do not exasperate opposite propensions; and
   therefore the soul enjoyeth a great deal of quiet and calmness under
   shows. False graces do not aim at growth, and so exclude care; and do
   not exasperate doubts, and so exclude fear. There is not such a
   struggling with the relics and remainders of unbelief. The children of
   God believe that they may believe: 1 John v. 13, These things have I
   written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye
   may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name
   of the Son of God.' They would grow up into greater measures. David
   checketh distrusts: Ps. xlii. 5, Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and
   why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God.'

   Gracious hearts are troubled at their evil imaginations. Others are
   drawing back, till God hath no pleasure in them, Heb. x. 38.

   2. The effects that concern other gracious constitutions: so justifying
   and saving faith hath four effects:--

   [1.] It humbleth and melteth for sin. The passover is to be eaten with
   sour herbs. A man cannot look upon Christ but with a bitter remembrance
   of his own guilt: Zech. xii. 10, They shall look upon him whom they
   have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only
   son.' Even our best actions to a believing soul cause grief. Like the
   ancient Israelites, who had seen the glory of the first house, when
   they saw how unlike the last was to the former, Ezra iii. 12, wept with
   a loud voice.' So these, when they have such a perfect model before
   them as Christ's love, and being like to make such weak returns, it
   humbleth their hearts. As the queen of Sheba, beholding the glory of
   Solomon, had no spirit left in her, 1 Kings x. 5, thinking her own
   glory nothing to his, so doth the soul at the contemplation of the
   excellences of Christ.

   [2.] It purgeth the heart from sin: Acts xv. 9, Purifying their hearts
   by faith.' The apostle speaketh of the Gentiles: if they had not the
   ceremonial purgings, they have that which is better--their hearts are
   purified by faith. The blood of Christ cleanses from sin. It doth not
   only allay the burning of the spirit when it is upon it, but also doth
   away the defilement. Faith and lusts are like a poison and a
   preservative, they cannot lodge quietly in one soul. Apprehensions of
   grace, even in the Gentiles, are the keenest arguments against sin. A
   man never learned how to deal with sin to purpose till the appearance
   of grace. Therefore the apostle saith, Titus ii. 11, 12, The grace of
   God, that bringeth salvation, appeareth to all men, teaching us that,
   denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
   righteously, and godly in the present world.'

   [3.] It sets a high price and value upon Christ, so as to part with all
   for his sake. Love is not to be measured with respect to the
   intenseness of the object, but the valuation of it: Mat. xiii. 46, He
   parted with all for the pearl of great price.' See whether you can part
   with worldly comforts, or with Christ. Let lusts go, and sin go. Our
   Father's house is the least thing that we can quit for him: Ps. xlv.
   10, Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house.' A small
   contentment. It was Abraham's commendation that he did not with hold
   his son, his only son, Gen. xxii. 12. God trieth us sometimes by things
   that are great in our esteem, to see whether we will hazard the
   comforts of Christ, or the loss of our own contentments. Alas! there
   should be no worldly respect but should be sacrificed upon this
   account. Many profess Christ, but they do not prize him; they are apt
   to be scandalised with the least suffering for his sake: Luke xvi. 26,
   If ye forsake not all, ye cannot be my disciples.'

   [4.] It worketh by love: Gal. v. 6, For in Jesus Christ neither
   circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith, which
   worketh by love.' It aboundeth in all holy duty out of love. Mercies
   are such an argument as leaveth a constraint upon the soul: 2 Cor. v.
   14, The love of Christ constraineth us.' Terrors and fears cannot urge
   the spirit so as love will. Carnal affections make us lazy, but faith
   begets in us love, and love maketh us labour. Those that love much,
   will do much. Now by this you may discern the nature of justifying
   faith.

   Secondly, My next work is to show you how it justifieth. There being
   mistakes in this matter, I shall endeavour to lay the truth before you.

   1. Faith does not justify as a mutual cause together with works, as if
   they did co-operate together; but we must distinguish. There is a first
   and second justification, the one ascribed to faith, the other to
   works. This opinion maketh as if we were beholden to grace only for
   some courtesies, where we cannot engage God of ourselves. It is true
   James saith, Not by faith, but by works;' but that is only to justify
   faith. It is a false faith that doth not end in works; but works have
   nothing to do in justification. God abhorreth such a profane medley; he
   would have it wholly of grace. The papists exact an imaginary faith,
   and so are put upon a necessity of eking it out with works.

   2. Not as an act and grace in us. Faith justifieth relativè, not
   effectivè et formaliter: not as if the act of believing were instead of
   perfect obedience to the law, and as if it were grace in us, and not an
   apprehending of Christ's righteousness. But it is in reference to the
   object that it is said to justify, only because of its necessary
   concurrence as an instrument. Christ's righteousness maketh us
   righteous, only because it cannot apprehend this righteousness but by
   faith, therefore it is said faith doth it. The hand may be said to feed
   and nourish the body, but the nutritive virtue is not in the hand, but
   the meat. There are divers reasons to sway you to believe this:--

   [1.] Because faith is always said to justify as complicated with its
   object, from whom it receiveth all its virtue.

   E2.] Because the righteousness of faith is always contradistinct
   opposed to that which is in ourselves: Rom. x. 3, For they, being
   ignorant of God's righteousness, they go about to establish their own
   righteousness.' Now how anything in us can be called God's
   righteousness, judge ye. So Phil. iii. 9, And be found in him, not
   having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is
   through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by
   faith,' Rom. i. 17, in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed
   from faith to faith;' Rom. iii. 22, Even the righteousness of God,
   which is by the faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all that
   believe.'

   [3.] Because the apostle speaketh of imputing righteousness for faith,
   as well as faith for righteousness: Rom. iv. 6, Unto whom God imputeth
   righteousness without works.'

   [4] Because we are never said to be justified propter fidem, but per
   fidem; not because of faith, but by faith. But I shall speak to the
   matter of imputation in the next point.

   3. Faith doth not justify, that is, merely receive the witness of our
   justification, as those that make it assurance; that is a thing that
   followeth faith. We are not justified before faith, for then actual
   unbelievers would be subject to no condemnation; whereas he that
   believeth not is condemned already,' John iii. 18.

   But to show affirmatively how faith justifieth, as an instrument which
   God hath deputed to the apprehension and application of Christ's
   righteousness, the whole order is thus:--

   [1.] By effectual calling God begetteth faith, and uniteth us to Jesus
   Christ. Faith is the grace of union, and we are said to live in him by
   faith,' Gal. ii. 20. And he is said to dwell in our hearts by faith.'
   Eph. iii. 17.

   [2.] And being united to Christ, we are possessed of all that is in
   Christ; so that whatsoever he hath suffered or done becometh ours: 2
   Cor. v. 21, For he was made sin for us, that knew no sin, that we might
   be made the righteousness of God in him.' As Christ had our sins, so we
   have his righteousness. So that we find imputation a real thing.

   [3.] Then God looketh upon us as righteous; and so--

   (1.) He absolveth us from all sin by a free and full pardon, and we are
   as if we were not sinners in the sight of God: Jer. l. 20, The
   iniquities of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and
   the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found;' Ps. ciii. 12, As far
   as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions
   from us.'

   (2.) He accepteth us as righteous to eternal life, so complete as we
   cannot be challenged: Rom. viii. 32, Who shall lay anything to the
   charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth;' Rom. v. 21, That as
   sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through
   righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.'

   Use 1. It showeth us the excellency of faith. God hath put a high
   honour upon it; all the conveyances of Christ come into the soul this
   way, but especially of justification; and what a mercy is it that God
   would require nothing of us but faith!

   2. It presseth us to get faith; it is the instrument of justification,
   the grace that maketh all sure to the people of God. The world liveth
   by guess or random; and alas! what a misery is it to have only our own
   contrivances and good meanings! Faith is designed to clothe us with the
   righteousness of Christ, and that is the best robe. Oh, labour only for
   that! Take heed it be a justifying faith. To this end take two
   cautions:--

   [1.] Get such a faith as will endure the sight of God. If you be
   justified it must be by faith, a righteousness that will endure that:
   Ps. cxliii. 2, For in thy sight shall no man living be justified.' And
   that is the reason why the deeds of the law are excluded. Nay, get such
   a faith as will endure the appearance of Jesus Christ, even his
   terrible appearance in judgment. Graces are true when they can endure
   that brunt: Luke xxi. 36, Watch and pray, that you may be able to stand
   before the Son of man at his coming,' 1 John iv. 17, That we may have
   boldness in the day of judgment;' that is a sensible proof of the truth
   of graces. 1 John ii. 28, And now, little children, abide in him, that
   when he shall appear, you may have confidence, and may not be ashamed
   at his coming.'

   [2.] Let it be such a faith as taketh Christ out of God's hand, such a
   faith as will stand with knowledge and more discoveries of Christ. The
   more ignorant any are, the more presumptuous. It must be such a faith
   as apprehends Christ in the use of all the means appointed. To talk of
   faith while we contemn or neglect the means, is but an idle fancy, an
   imaginary persuasion, not faith, and will easily discover our folly.

   By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall
   bear their iniquities.

   I am now come to the next circumstance in the order of the words, and
   that is the efficient cause in justification, which is Jesus Christ,
   expressed here by God's righteous servant;' for so he is to be
   considered in the business of justification, or else it were ill for
   the creatures. What this expression will amount to we shall see by and
   by. The point is:--

   Doct. That Jesus Christ justifieth as God's righteous servant. I
   shall--

   1. Explain the point.

   2. Prove it.

   3. Apply it.

   For the explaining the matter to you, consider these two things:--

   1. How Christ was God's servant.

   2. How Christ was God's righteous servant.

   First, Christ was said to be God's servant, partly as he subjected
   himself to the condition of man, and because he lived among men in a
   needy, servile, and abject state of life, not like a prince, but a
   servant, which is the lowest form of rational creatures. And it is
   expressed by taking the form of a servant; upon him, Phil, ii, 7.
   Angels are called sons, and man a servant; The sons of God shouted for
   joy,' Job xxxviii. 7. In the family of heaven they were to God as
   servants.

   And partly as he was a choice instrument for the executing of God's
   decrees. Those that are taken into any degree of subserviency to God's
   counsels have this badge of honour put upon them, to be God's servants,
   as Nebuchadnezzar is called God's servant, Jer. xxvii. 6. Now, because
   Christ submitted himself to the office of the mediatorship, and so to a
   subserviency to God's decrees, he is called a servant: Isa. xlii. 1,
   Behold my servant, whom I uphold;' Isa. xlix. 3, Thou art my servant.'
   And this being an instrument of God's decrees, is called service,
   because whosoever is employed in it is to sequester himself for the
   uses of God, and to divest himself of all self-respect, and like a
   servant to be at the command of another, and wholly to give up himself
   to the profit and benefit of his Master. So Christ, not aiming at
   himself, accomplished the work of God to God's glory and the salvation
   of man. And--

   Partly as he subjected himself to the law of God and the covenant of
   works, which was a covenant of servants. A servant expects his hire as
   the reward of his work, and therefore the state of the gospel is called
   a state of sonship: Gal. iv. 5, To redeem them that were under the law,
   that they might receive the adoption of sons.' So in the 1st verse of
   that chapter, The heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing
   from a servant;' that is, those that are under the covenant of grace
   did very little differ from those that are under the covenant of works,
   in the time of the church's infancy and ceremonial dispensation,
   because it was a ministry of condemnation. Everywhere the covenant of
   works is made as the covenant of an hireling, and implieth bondage and
   service. And therefore Christ, because he submitted himself to such a
   covenant, and seeing he was to be judged of God according to all
   extremity and rigour, things were carried between God and Christ in a
   way of justice, and our grace and glory were due to him. So that in all
   these respects Christ was God's servant.

   Use 1. Is to commend to us the service of God. It is a glory to a
   society when princes are of it: you count the order or company
   dignified when they will come into your fellowship. You have Jesus
   Christ in your fellowship. Oh, certainly the service of God can be no
   disgrace to you! God calleth him my servant. This was David's choice:
   Ps. lxxxiv. 10, I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God, than
   to dwell in the tents of wickedness.' The meanest employment in God's
   service is a greater honour than any sinful dignity. Christ did not
   honour kingship and lordship, and the dignities of the world in his
   person here upon earth, but only meanness and obedience. Think it no
   reproach to be engaged in such services with David as are most mean and
   low in the world's eye. Your fellow-servant is Christ.

   Use 2. To commend to us the love of Christ, that he should divest
   himself of all his glory, and appear in the form of a servant.

   1. It was love that he should submit himself to our nature. Do but
   consider what an infinite distance there was between the Godhead and
   us, and then you may guess somewhat what a strange condescension there
   was in his love. How many degrees it came down to meet the creatures
   for their good. There are divers things to aggravate it. That Christ
   should take our nature, when he left equal glory with the Father. It
   was a great abasement for Adam to fall from his excellency by sin to
   meanness; for us to stoop is no such matter, but it was most amazing in
   him that thought it no robbery to be equal with God,' Phil. ii. 6. Then
   that he took upon him the form of a servant,' not of angels, which is a
   higher degree of natures, and would have been a fitter form for a Son,
   but of a man, and that the form of a servant--he went to the lowest
   rank of rational creatures. Then how he took it, not of the highest
   order of men; he came not in the pomp, equipage and appearance of a
   king and prince. The Jews looked for a mighty monarch. Christ had right
   to all the world, but he would not hold by that tenure. It was the form
   of a servant, not only in respect of the angels, but in respect of men.
   He was found in the lowest rank of men, poor and destitute, therefore
   called chadall ishim: Isa, lii. 3, despised and rejected.' In the
   Hebrew it is the leavings off of men; man just left off there where
   Christ was found: if he had gone lower, he could not be man: Ps. xx. 6,
   I am a worm, and no man;' rather found among the rank of poor
   despicable worms, than of men. Then, what were the effects of it? Even
   upon this he was refused of those for whose good he came; they rejected
   him, nay slew him, because he came in this disguise of meanness for
   their sakes. He gained no honour by it, neither did the world know him
   the better: John i. 11, He came to his own, and his own received him
   not.' In short, this was the great cause why he was the object of the
   Jewish scorn and rejection. Nay, further, consider this was not only an
   accidental event, and a thing that was not aimed at, but the very end
   of Christ. He was found in the form of a servant, that he might be
   handled in a despiteful manner, and that the decrees of God might be
   accomplished upon his person. He could have shown himself in majesty,
   and have prevented his sufferings, as he saith, Mat. xxvi. 53, 54,
   Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray unto my Father, and he shall
   presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how, then,
   shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?' Well, then,
   you find a great deal of matter to be offered to your thoughts for the
   commendation of Christ's love.

   2. There is more in Christ's being a servant. He subjected himself to
   your covenant--the covenant of works--that lay upon all men naturally:
   Gal. iv. 4, Made under the law'--not only the moral law, which is not a
   slavery, but a freedom; whereas, on the contrary, the satisfying of our
   corrupt desires is the greatest slavery in the world: 2 Peter ii. 19,
   While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
   corruption.' But that he should put himself into such a condition as to
   make himself liable to his Father's wrath, to take our curse upon him,
   yea, to be made a curse for us.' Gal. iii. 13, that is a high instance
   of the love of Christ--that he, that was the beloved of his Father the
   apostle calleth him the Son of his love.' Col. i. 13; we translate it
   his dear Son'--that he, I say, should become the receptacle of his
   Father's wrath, and that all his anger should as it were be pitched
   upon him,--what a circumstance is this! Thus you see Christ is God's
   servant.

   Secondly, In the next place, you must look upon him as God's righteous
   servant; and thus he hath taken our work and burden upon him. There is
   a threefold righteousness of Christ:--

   1. Essential and divine, which is that infinite and surpassing
   perfection which is in him as he was God. That is not to be considered
   in this place, partly because he speaketh here of the righteousness of
   Christ as a servant; but this is the righteousness of Christ as a Lord.
   And besides, this is not communicable to the creatures. It was the
   dream of Osiander that the Lord should, in justification, communicate
   to us his essential righteousness. But hear what the prophet saith:
   Isa. xlii. 8, My glory will I not give to another.' God saith expressly
   he will part with none of his essential glory. His creatures are not
   vested with that.

   2. There is his absolute and personal righteousness, as he is Mediator
   and God-man, and is able to make others righteous. And so it is said,
   John iii. 34, God giveth not the Spirit by measure to him.' He had as a
   man the Spirit without measure, not sparingly, but poured out with a
   full hand and in abundance. And so it is said, Col. i. 19, It pleased
   the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;' and Col. ii. 9, For
   in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.' Christ's soul
   is filled by the union of the Godhead with all created and habitual
   graces. Though these things are for us, and God hath made Christ a
   storehouse of sufficiencies for the elect, yet they are not imputed to
   us. It is true, though we are full of sin, and Christ came into the
   world full of righteousness, and so it is a just remedy against the
   sinfulness of our natures, and it qualified the Lord Jesus to be a fit
   person to do us good; yet here we speak not of the righteousness of
   Christ as a servant, but of his service; and we have not this fulness
   imputed to us so as that we may become saviours to one another. Christ
   was by these things fitted to do us good, and to be a continual
   magazine of comforts and graces, to which the creatures might have
   recourse in all their troubles: Eph. iv. 7, But unto every one of us is
   grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.'

   3. There is a dispensative and relative righteousness, which is called
   justitia fidejussoria, the righteousness that Christ performed for us,
   and in our stead, as our surety, even the righteousness that he
   manifested in the work and service of our redemption. And so chiefly he
   is to be considered as God's righteous servant. He showed it in two
   things:--

   [1.] In exact obedience, even to the least tittle of the law, for our
   sakes. We could not possibly keep in with God, therefore Christ did:
   Rom. viii. 3, For what the law could not do, in that it was weak
   through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful
   flesh, for sin condemned sin in the flesh;' Mat. iii. 15, It becometh
   us to fulfil all righteousness.' He doth that for us which we could not
   do in ourselves. And therefore Christ is said to be the end of the law
   for righteousness to every one that believeth,' Rom. x. 4. The end of
   the law is perfection of obedience, and Christ is that to us by having
   fulfilled it in his own person. The scriptures do everywhere avow this
   righteousness of Christ and exactness of keeping the law: Isa. liii. 9,
   it is said, There was no deceit in his mouth.' It was not a pretended
   show. As to the holiness of his conversation: 2 Cor. v. 21, He knew no
   sin;' that is, he had no experimental knowledge of it in his own soul:
   1 Peter ii. 22, Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.'
   There could be nothing justly charged upon him as to his conversation.
   Farther, it is said, Heb. iv. 15, He was in all points tempted like us,
   yet without sin.' Men usually miscarry in their temptations. Jesus
   Christ was tempted, his soul was assaulted even to a consternation; but
   there was no sin in it; like a glass of pure water that is jogged, but
   it stirreth up no mud. Thus you see what a righteous servant Christ is.
   God ordained him to the suretyship of the creature, and he was faithful
   in it, and did all things well.

   [2.] His passive obedience. And it is that sacrifice and offering of
   himself that Christ made for the sins of the world, bearing our curse
   and punishment, and so satisfying for our transgression: 1 Tim. ii. 5,
   6, The man Christ Jesus gave himself a ransom for all.' He suffered so
   long till he had satisfied God's justice, and engaged the very
   righteousness of God to the good of the creature too, and would not
   expire his soul till all were finished and made sure. See John xix. 30,
   It is finished,' and then he gave up the ghost. The scriptures every
   where speak of this, and therefore I shall be more sparing in it. You
   see now how Christ was God's righteous servant.

   To apply it:--

   Use 1. It holdeth out a pattern for us to imitate God's righteous
   servant as well as we can, and to enjoin us to write after this copy.
   Several things are remarkable in the righteousness of Christ; I shall
   only instance in two:--

   1. The sincerity of his spirit.

   2. Innocency of his conversation.

   1. The sincerity of his spirit. There is no guile in Christ, and there
   should be none in those that have benefit by him: Ps. xxxii. 2, Blessed
   is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose
   spirit there is no guile.' Be not for appearances and shows. Corrupt
   aims and self-advantages, and desire of esteem amongst men, argue a
   false spirit, which is all for appearances. They do not care what God
   thinketh of them, for they are all for repute: 1 Cor. iv. 3, But with
   me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's
   judgment.' Gracious hearts count that nothing; their desire is to
   approve themselves to God.

   2. Innocency of conversation. It became our High Priest to be harmless
   and undefiled; so should we be: Phil. ii. 15, That ye may be blameless
   and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a
   crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the
   world.' Be righteous in your ways, be faithful to your work. Christ
   knew no sin; it is a holy simplicity to be simple in evil. Christ was
   tempted, yet without sin. Watch over your spirits in temptations, that
   they may not encroach upon you to the betraying of yourselves into any
   unbecoming or unworthy walking.

   Use 2. Is comfort to poor broken-hearted sinners. Christ was God's
   righteous servant, and so fitted to make a Saviour for sinners, and to
   plead with God for you. You say you are sinners, but Jesus Christ is
   righteous. You are all ill servants of God, compassed about with daily
   infirmities. Ay! but Jesus Christ was a righteous servant--he was
   righteous in our stead: 1 John ii. 1, I write unto you that you sin
   not; and if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ the righteous.' Sin not; that is, do not allow yourselves in
   sin; but if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father. Though
   God will not hear you, he will hear Christ; he never offended him. It
   is very observable that all comfort usually in scripture is made to
   flow from the righteousness of Christ: Zech. ix. 9, Behold thy king
   cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation.' He bringeth
   salvation with him, for he is righteous. So Dan. ix. 24; the Messiah
   was to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in an everlasting
   righteousness. You may be confident he is gracious with God, and he
   will make you gracious. There is righteousness to satisfy justice.
   Christ's righteousness is fit to satisfy, for there is no sin in it.
   And there is righteousness to make up your defects--to make you
   righteous in his righteousness. But that is the work of the next
   inquiry.

   And, therefore, I now come to show how Christ is said to justify as
   God's righteous servant. I shall open this matter to you:--

   1. Negatively. He justifieth as a servant, and therefore--

   [1.] He doth not exclude God the Father from being the first eternal
   moving cause of our justification. It hath its first rise at his mercy
   in ordaining Christ: Rom. iii. 24, Being justified freely by his grace,
   through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.' It was the pleasure of
   the Father. Grace is most sure and free when we look upon his
   contrivances for your good. He gave Christ, and predestinated you to
   enjoy the benefits; he elected you rather than another: Eph. i. 5,
   Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ,
   to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will. Therefore, it
   implieth that Christ was not the first moving cause of justification.
   He only is a righteous servant. There was some antecedent love and
   mercy that deputed him to that service.

   [2.] It doth not exclude the grant and sentence of the Father; and the
   sentence is passed by the Father, though it be procured by Christ as
   the servant of God's decrees in this matter. Rom. iii. 26, the Father
   is said to be the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.' We have an
   advocate with the Father,' 1 John ii. 1. Sin is committed against him;
   his will is the rule of justice; and by nature, right, and office, he
   is the supreme judge.

   2. Affirmatively. So Christ is said to justify two ways:--

   [1.] By meriting that righteousness which will serve for justification.
   His obeying and suffering have procured such a righteousness as will
   stand us in stead, for Christ's righteousness is ours. We have share in
   whatever he had, for he was our surety; as he saith, John xvii. 19, I
   sanctify myself, that they may be sanctified;' and Eph. i. 6, He hath
   accepted us in the beloved.' We are beloved in his love, sanctified in
   his sanctification, and so righteous in his righteousness. I shall
   prove it more by and by. And then it is the best way, in procuring such
   a righteousness by his life and death as should avail the creatures in
   their acceptance with God.

   [2.] By meriting the Spirit that constitutes and gives us an interest
   in this righteousness: 2 Cor. v. 20, We pray you in Christ's stead, be
   ye reconciled to God.' All the entreaties of the word are from Christ.
   He offereth grace in the word, and conferreth it by the Spirit. He
   justifieth them as a righteous servant, because it is his righteousness
   which is the matter of justification, and it is his Spirit that effects
   it in us, and interests us in it. His righteousness and his Spirit,
   though imputed and bestowed upon us by the Father, yet they are merited
   by Christ, and bestowed upon us by the Spirit of Christ.

   To apply this.

   Use 1. Is to check those that deny the imputation of Christ's
   righteousness. He justifieth as a righteous servant, as having procured
   righteousness for us by his own obedience and suffering. He causeth us
   to be absolved as righteous before God by his own righteousness; made
   ours by virtue of our union with him.

   1. Some deny the imputation of the righteousness of Christ, either
   active or passive, as the papists and Socinians, who both deny that we
   are justified by the imputation of Christ's righteousness. But what a
   strange thing is it that the papists, who in other doctrines establish
   the imputation of the righteousness of a man, of a monk, or a dead man,
   in their works of supererogation, should yet deny the righteousness of
   Christ! They say there is no such expression in scripture. But to both
   these I oppose these places:--The apostle speaketh of the imputation of
   righteousness, Rom. iv. 6, Even as David also describeth the
   blessedness of the man to whom God imputeth righteousness without
   works.' And the prophet calleth Christ the Lord our righteousness,'
   Jer. xxxiii. 16. And Christ is said to be made to us of the Father
   righteousness,' 1 Cor. i. 30. And we are said to be made the
   righteousness of God in him,' 2 Cor. v. 21, as he was made sin for us,
   and both by imputation. And he addeth this as an argument, that it
   would not stand with the justice of God--take it for the exact tenor of
   righteousness, which is essential to his nature, or his will revealed
   in his word--to constitute a wicked man righteous, unless there be some
   righteousness to make him so. Now, none will serve the turn but
   Christ's, for that is exact and regular. For the former, see Prov.
   xvii. 15, He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the
   just, even they both are an abomination to the Lord.' And God saith,
   Exod. xx., that he will not hold sinners guiltless. And you may add,
   that still the righteousness whereby we are justified is opposed to
   that which is inherent in us. Certainly we are made righteous by
   imputation; for by the same justice that Christ is made a sinner, we
   are made righteous.

   2. There are others that deal with the robes of Christ's righteousness
   as the king of Ammon did by the garments of David's messengers; they
   cut them off by the middle, they exclude the active obedience of
   Christ, but upon slender grounds. In opposition to these consider:--

   [1.] The need of both his active and passive obedience. By his passive
   obedience, by death, the punishment of sin is taken away; and by his
   active obedience the law is fulfilled for us: so that we have not only
   pardon but acceptance; so that there is not only a restraint of
   vengeance, but pardon obtained. The guilt and punishment of sin is done
   away by his death; the other benefit, favour and acceptance, is
   procured by his obedience. There must be something done by way of
   satisfaction to divine justice and to appease his wrath, and something
   by way of acquisition of favour: these are the two things procured by
   Christ. Absalom was pardoned, but he saw not the king's face. We are
   God's creatures, bound to his law, as well as his prisoners, liable to
   his wrath; and there must be the expiation of sin and the fulfilling of
   all righteousness. There are two blessings obtained by Christ--freedom
   from death, and the benefit of eternal life.

   [2.] We are expressly said in scripture to be made righteous by the
   obedience of Christ, which is exactly opposed to the disobedience of
   Adam: Rom. v. 19, For as by one man's disobedience many were made
   sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.' We
   are condemned by Adam's actual guilt, and made righteous by Christ's
   active obedience.

   [3.] In the very passive obedience of Christ, the active part is the
   chief; for the sufferings of Christ do not simply justify us. but as
   they are the sufferings of Christ, voluntarily yielding up himself in
   obedience to his Father's will. For Christ was to be considered as the
   sacrifice or the priest: as a sacrifice, so passive; as a priest, so
   active: Phil. ii. 8, He became obedient to death, even the death of the
   cross;' and Heb. x. 10, By the which will we are sanctified, through
   the offering of the body of Jesus Christ.' He willingly undertook to do
   for us what we were bound to do.

   Use 2. Is to press you to go to Christ, that you may be interested in
   his righteousness: it cometh by union.

   The rules are these:--

   1. See the insufficiency of your own righteousness. The creatures'
   fig-leaves will never cover a naked soul; there must be first a sight
   of your own vileness, and of your own inability to help yourselves out
   of it. It is observable in John xvi. 8, that the Spirit doth first
   convince of sin and then of righteousness. Christ doth not seek us till
   we be lost, and we cannot seek Christ till we are lost. The soul doth
   most truly seek Christ when loosened from all other things, from all
   false props and expectations, and seeth plainly that it shall perish if
   it have not an interest in Christ. As Simon Peter said, John vi. 68,
   Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.'
   Whither should we go? thou hast the only righteousness.

   2. Consider your own filthy rags, and then you will long, desire, and
   groan for change of raiment. Alas! your persons are covered with your
   own guilt, and your natures are full of sin; what will you do to appear
   before God? Alas! you can scarce keep up a fair show before a
   discerning man; what will you do before a God of pure eyes? Job xv. 15,
   The heavens are not clean in his sight.' The holy angels in comparison
   of God are nothing, yea, less than nothing. But do you think to help
   yourselves by your services, your duties, and good meanings? Alas! as
   long as you stick there, no good will be done: the saints blame
   themselves in the sense of their duties; their best performances are
   poor, worthless things: Isa. lxiv. 6, But we are all as an unclean
   thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.' They will not
   make your souls amiable: Phil. iii. 9, And be found in him, not having
   mine own righteousness.'

   3. Consider the willingness of God to clothe you with the righteousness
   of Jesus Christ; Christ was appointed to this very end: Rom. iii. 25,
   Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
   blood, to declare his righteousness.' God's design was to lay open his
   heart to the creatures, and to show how willing he was that you should
   come unto him in this way: 1 Cor. i. 30, Who of God is made unto us
   wisdom and righteousness.' If we had framed it, it had been more
   doubtful, but God appointed a righteousness of his own making; and
   therefore it is everywhere called in scripture the righteousness of
   God,' not only because it was the righteousness of God-man, Christ
   Jesus, but God's righteousness, that is, of his appointment.

   4. Consider the worth of this righteousness; it is better than if we
   had stood in our innocency, and had procured it in our own persons.
   Luke xv. 22, it is called the best robe;' better than we should have
   had if we had stayed in our father's house; far better than that we
   lost in Adam. Our repair is more excellent than our first make, and it
   contents God better; the creature is most humbled, and God most
   exalted: this is as it should be, when we have nothing in ourselves,
   and fetch all from God. It is as good as the best of the saints have;
   you are as righteous as David, and as righteous as Abraham and all the
   worthies of God: Rom. iii. 22, Even the righteousness of God, which is
   by the faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all that believe, for
   there is no difference.' In this case there is no difference indeed:
   Rev. xix. 8, And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
   linen, clean and white; for the fine linen is the righteousness of the
   saints.' The saints have one common righteousness; as it was with the
   Israelites in point of the manna, none had more than another, none had
   over or under; nay, higher, it is as good or better than the
   righteousness of angels, for they are confirmed in their own
   righteousness. Isa. vi. 2, the seraphims covered their faces as being
   abashed at the glorious holiness of God; and before him they are not
   clean, they cannot stand before the holiness of God. And in Job iv. 18,
   His angels he chargeth with folly;' that is, comparatively, and in
   respect of himself, they might be accused, rather than accounted
   righteous. But now we may have access with confidence and boldness, as
   the apostle saith, Eph. iii. 12, because we do not come in our own
   holiness, but Christ's. Nay, further, in some sort, it maketh us as
   righteous as Christ himself; therefore it is said, 1 John iii. 7, He
   that doth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous;' that
   is, he doth truly show forth that he is righteous in Christ's
   righteousness; nay, this is a righteousness that will endure God's
   sight. You must needs obtain the blessing in the garment of your elder
   brother.

   5. Seek it in Christ's way; then you are like to obtain it, at least
   you shall be sure not to deceive yourselves. Many conceit themselves to
   be in a good estate, and that Christ is theirs, and all his
   righteousness theirs, when they never sought it in his way; you must
   therefore look to this. This way of Christ respects two things:--

   [1.] The manner of obtaining.

   [2.] Our ends and aims in it.

   [1.] The manner of obtaining it must be by union; this righteousness is
   not gotten by an assent to the truth of any promise or proposition in
   the word, but by an union with Jesus Christ. We are not united to any
   promise, but to Christ. Many take a promise, and go away with it. But
   alas! you are to take Christ in the promise, for there is no promise
   that appertaineth to any till they are one with Christ. Therefore there
   must be union before you can take any comfort in him; for all the
   promises are his, and you have not right in them till you have a right
   in him: 2 Cor. i. 20, All the promises of God in him are yea, and in
   him amen.' So they will be true and certain to you. Many flatter
   themselves in this kind. They go away with the words of a promise, but
   do not care to carry out their faith to the person of Christ tendered
   in the promise. You cannot close with Christ without a promise, so not
   with a promise without him. Look, as it is in the spiritual life, many
   think to live upon a comfortable word or a promise of God, whereas they
   should live upon Christ in a promise; as men do not live upon their
   conveyances and leases, but their lands: so here, you do not come to a
   promise for righteousness, but to Christ in it.

   [2.] The ends and aims in it; both the subordinate and the ultimate
   ends must be right.

   (1.) The subordinate end, which concerneth ourselves and our own good.
   Be not contented without the king's face, the grace of God, and the
   light of his countenance. Many desire to allay the burnings of their
   consciences, and to cool the heat that is in their spirits through
   guilt, and would fain shun hell and horror, but do not care for
   communion with God, and to be in a state of favour and amity with the
   Lord. Alas! a pardon is nothing without acceptance; it were hell enough
   not to enjoy God. In justification there must be both done, an allaying
   of wrath and procuring of favour. Zech. iii. 4. The filthy garments
   must be taken away, and we must be clothed with change of raiment. I
   have caused thine iniquities to pass from thee;' but that is not
   enough: I will clothe thee.' There must be a charming of wrath and a
   being accepted in the beloved, Eph. i. 6. Hypocrites they are
   altogether for removal of punishment, but do not care how they stand in
   God's favour, so as they may receive the communications of grace. Oh,
   do not you rest in that, and only make it your care to get the
   punishment off.

   (2.) The ultimate end, which concerneth God's glory. God's end in the
   covenant of grace is to exalt mercy; and therefore it is said, Eph. i.
   6, He hath accepted us in the beloved;' that is God's end in the
   covenant of grace, to exalt the glory of grace: Isa. xlviii. 9, For my
   name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain
   for thee, that I cut thee not off.' There is God's end in all: and when
   our end and God's end are the same, then our desires are the most
   regular. Now what is your end in desiring the righteousness of
   Christ--God's glory, or your own good? The natural inclination and
   propension that is in us to our own good may work a desire to have sin
   for given, and to be saved from wrath, or that conscience may be
   pacified; but to desire that we may be accepted in the beloved, to the
   praise of the glory of his grace, that is a heavenly frame of spirit;
   not that you may be exalted, but grace in you. Seek the righteousness
   of Christ with the same mind that God offereth it in the covenant.

   Use 3. It serveth for instruction to us, to make Jesus Christ, as he is
   Mediator, God-man, the object of our faith.. We may do it, and we ought
   to do it. Whosoever justifieth me becomes the object of my faith. Now
   not only God the Father justifieth, but also Jesus Christ, God's
   righteous servant. And therefore, in; the work of our faith, we are not
   only to reflect upon God the Father, but Jesus Christ as Media tor. And
   indeed we ought to do so, for much of the comfort of believing
   dependeth upon our taking of him into our thoughts: John xiv. 1, Let
   not your hearts be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me.' It
   easeth us much of the trouble of our hearts when our souls have
   recourse to Christ, when we believe in him. who was God's righteous
   servant.

   I shall here handle two questions, and so despatch this use:--

   First, What it is to believe in Christ as God's righteous servant? It
   is not only to believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; not only to
   have distinct and explicit thoughts of the Trinity; but to believe in
   Christ as Mediator. You have a willing God, and you have an able
   Saviour. It is to reflect upon the whole carriage of Christ's
   mediatorship, as a sufficient help for poor creatures; there is enough
   in God's righteous servant to become a sufficient bottom and ground for
   our faith. Though faith is not to rest in Christ, it is to begin in
   him, that by him we may the more comfortably believe in God. And this
   is the reason why many times there is no other object of faith
   expressed but Jesus Christ: John i. 12, To as many as received him, to
   them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe
   on his name.'

   Second question, What special comfort and privilege doth there come to
   faith by it?

   1. By this you have a double claim. An interest in God by virtue of the
   covenant of grace made with your persons, and the covenant of works
   made with Jesus Christ. It is due to you as it is all of grace, but to
   Jesus Christ it was a due debt; he satisfied justice and merited mercy:
   Rom. iii. 24, Being justified freely by his grace, through the
   redemption that is in Jesus Christ;' that is Christ's claim, and your
   claim by virtue of your interest in him. So the 26th verse, That he
   might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.' When
   you reflect upon Jesus Christ, your claim is not disannulled, but
   strengthened by the justice of God. Christ hath satisfied justice and
   merited mercy; Christ hath satisfied the covenant of works by suffering
   what was due in point of transgression, and by discharging what was due
   in point of obedience. You see satisfaction as well as imputation.

   2. It ministereth matter of glory and triumph of faith, considering
   every scruple. You have not only a proof of the Father's love, but the
   Son's merit: Rom. viii. 34, Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ
   that died.' And therefore faith speaketh of glorying in the cross of
   Christ, Gal. vi. 14. There is matter of glorying in the cross of
   Christ, in his obedience and death, that there is so full satisfaction
   and such exact obedience. Oh, plead it to your souls; he fulfilled
   every tittle. Alas! we have but little cause to boast; we know but in
   part, and do but in part; but in Christ we may glory; nay, you may
   glory in God the Father: 1 Cor. i. 31, That according as it is written,
   He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.' Why? because Christ is
   made all to us by the Father--wisdom, righteousness, and
   sanctification, and redemption: an object fully satisfying, so that now
   you may make your boast of God all the day long.

   3. It ministereth joy, in that you see God in your own nature, and he
   is your kinsman. Affinity begets obedience and hopes of speeding. Your
   hearts would tremble and quiver at the sight of God's back parts in his
   own glorious nature; and therefore, because you cannot converse with
   God in his own nature, there is Christ to help to relieve you; in
   believing God in your own nature, that is an object of our faith. Hence
   it is said, Eph. iii. 12, We have access with boldness through the
   faith of him;' and Heb. x. 19, 20, Having therefore boldness to enter
   into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which
   he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his
   flesh.' The manhood of Christ is the means to bring God and us
   together; otherwise, there was a flaming sword against us every way,
   and we could not come near but we must die. The mere God head was
   incensed against us; and therefore, till God became man, there was no
   hope left unto us to see him; but when he became bone of our bone and
   flesh of our flesh, it was matter of great encouragement to the
   creature. There are other considerations, but these are enough to
   persuade you in believing, not only to look upon God, but to look upon
   Christ, to look upon God's righteous servant; not only upon the mercy
   or grace of God, but upon the mercy and grace engaged to you by the
   sufferings and obedience of Jesus Christ. Thus you see you have a
   double claim to God, and you have an excellent remedy against the
   doubts of your own hearts; you may see God in your own natures. The
   Lord grant you may have a right sight of these things, not that you may
   abuse them to looseness, and to the cherishing of presumption, and so
   turn Aaron's rod into a serpent, but that you may be helped in the
   great work of believing.

   I go on in the text to the next circumstance, and that is the object or
   subject of justification, that is many. He shall justify many.'

   1. It is put here exclusively, to shut out the universality of man
   kind; it is but many that he justifieth, it is not all.

   2. It is put inclusively, to take in the whole company of the faithful.
   Look upon those that are called of Christ in all ages, and they will
   come to such a number.

   I shall handle the first acceptation, as it excludeth the greater part
   of the world.

   Observe, then, that all are not justified by Christ. The privilege that
   God bestowed upon Christ was, that he should justify many.

   The reasons of the point are:--

   1. Because of his sovereign pleasure, to pass by some for their sins,
   and for the glory of his justice, and not to bestow upon them the grace
   of election; he may do with his own as it pleaseth him. And indeed,
   usually in this matter, the scriptures make God's pleasure to be all in
   all. There are some whose names are not written in the book of life of
   the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world. Some translations
   read it, Whose names are not written before the foundation of the world
   in the Lamb's book of life.' God never gave Christ a charge to save
   such men whose names are not in the Lamb's book. God dealeth out of
   absolute sovereignty: Prov. xvi. 4, God hath made all things for
   himself, and the wicked for the day of evil.' You would overlook that,
   but it is for the glorifying of his justice. It is observable, he doth
   not say he made the elect for the day of evil. There are many who grant
   that the wicked are for the day of evil, who do not grant eternal
   reprobation and preterition; these cavil at God's prerogative: Rom. ix.
   18, Whom he will he hardeneth;' i.e., with draws the influences of his
   grace from them. They are hardened as water is freezed by the absence
   of the sun. The preterition of God is not the cause of sin, but the
   antecedent: 2 Tim. ii. 20, In a great house there are not only vessels
   of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth; and some to honour, and
   some to dishonour.' And Jude 4, speaks of some who were of old ordained
   to this condemnation, before the world was.'

   2. Because all do not believe. It is a visible argument that all are
   not justified, because all do not apply themselves to Christ for
   justification. The righteousness of Christ will bear this limitation,
   none have a share in it but believers: Rom. iii. 22, Even the
   righteousness which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all
   that believe, for there is no difference.' All they, and none but they.
   Now, all are not believers: All have not faith,' 2 Thes. ii. 12, 13;
   Mat. xx. 16, Many are called, but few are chosen.' The preaching of the
   gospel doth not work upon all; they have the outward means, but not the
   inward grace. Scarce all have the outward means.

   Use 1. This checketh that wild charity that was in Origen, who thought
   that all should be saved at last, even the devils themselves. And this
   opinion was revived in Germany by a man of an obscure name, and by some
   in our days. Now, consider that the general drift of the scriptures
   saith, Depart from me, I know you not,' Mat. vii. 23. That there are
   goats as well as sheep; some to whom Christ will say, Go ye cursed.'
   Mat. xxv. 41. Some that are without: Rev. xxii. 15, Without are dogs,
   and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and
   whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.' The main places whereupon they
   build their conceit are these: Rom. v. 18, Wherefore as by the offence
   of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the
   righteousness of one, the free gift came unto all men to justification
   of life;' where Christ and Adam are compared together, and the one's
   sin and the other's sufferings are made equivalent: 1 Cor. xv. 22, As
   in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.' But in
   these places Christ and Adam are compared as two common roots, and the
   one should be as able to save, as the other to ruin those that belong
   to him. The other place is 1 Cor. xv. 28, That God may be all in all,'
   which they understand of God's presence and glory in all. But the
   apostle speaketh there only of those holy ones who shall have a
   glorious manifestation of the presence of God, so that God will be all
   in all to them. But I shall no longer rake in this dirt.

   Use 2. Is to teach you:--

   1. Not to be contented with those common privileges which all men may
   enjoy, for you may have all these and not be saved. All men are not
   justified, and therefore not saved. As in creation, because God
   bestowed a human form upon you, therefore you think he will save you;
   but God doth not save all those he hath made: Isa. xxvii. 11, It is a
   people of no understanding; and therefore he that made them will not
   have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no favour.'
   It is ill trusting to that. Men will say, I hope to be saved as well as
   others, and the like. The covenant of works was made with all men, as
   being in Adam's loins; but not that of grace, that is made to those
   that are given to Christ. Hath he given you a mind to know him? Heb.
   viii. 10, and a heart to receive him? John i. 12; then it is well. It
   is no privilege to be an intellectual creature, only to be wiser than
   the beasts to our own destruction. So for an estate; surely God loveth
   and favoureth me, because he blesseth me with worldly good things:
   Eccles. ix. 1, 2, No man knoweth love or hatred by all that is before
   them. All things come alike to all, and there is one event to the
   righteous, and to the wicked.' This all men may have, but you must have
   some privilege that is distinct. So for good meanings; they thank God
   they have a good heart towards him, and ever had, and that they know
   they have done their best; as the young man said, Mat. xix. 20, All
   these have I kept from my youth.' I tell you, whatever you have by
   nature, every man may have; and therefore, till you have faith and
   other graces, it is as nothing.

   2. It teacheth you not to flatter yourselves with the universality of
   grace and mercy. Many live and die, and rot in their sins, and think
   Christ will save them, and mercy will save them. You see Christ will
   not save all, and God gave him no commission to justify all: Deut.
   xxix. 19, 20, When he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless
   himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace though I walk in the
   imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: the Lord will
   not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall
   smoke against that man.' Mark, it is said, against that man. God hath a
   special quarrel at him that abuseth mercy: there will a time come when
   they shall see his justice; as the thief said on the cross, Luke xxiii.
   41, And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds.'

   Use 3. Is to the people of God, that have had any sense of their
   justification by Christ--any inclination to walk after the Spirit and
   not after the flesh: Rom. viii. 1, There is no condemnation to them.'
   Man is most taken with anything that is appropriate; it is a privilege
   that is mine,--it is not given to others. This exhorteth you to the
   greater sense of this privilege; it is not every one's mercy. The
   apostle showeth this is one of God's reasons in passing by the
   reprobate world: Rom. ix. 23, That he might make known the riches of
   his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto
   glory.' Your mercies are mightily aggravated by their want. Respects
   are not favours when they are bestowed promiscuously. Oh, consider this
   is the mercy of God's own people: Ps. cxix. 132, Look upon me, and be
   merciful unto me, as thou usest to do to those that love thy name.'
   Alas! what should engage God to you above others? Oh, consider and
   admire the goodness of God, that hath passed by millions, and yet
   manifested himself to thee, in whom there was no desert! This was an
   endearment to the Israelites: Ps. cxlvii. 19, 20, He hath showed his
   word to Jacob, his statutes and his judgments to Israel; he hath not
   dealt so with any nation;' Deut. vii. 7, 8, The Lord did not set his
   love upon you, nor choose you because ye were more in number than any
   people, but because the Lord loved you.'

THE TWELFTH VERSE.

   Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall
   divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul
   unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the
   sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

   IN this last verse, as in most of the former, you may observe a
   scandal, and a provision against it; for the prophet still continueth
   his method. As in the life of Christ, there was no passage or
   occurrence that did deject him to such a degree of abasement but that
   he showed forth some glimpse of his power and Godhead; as when they
   came to take him, he forced them to go backward and fall to the ground,
   John xviii. 6. So here, the prophet never giveth a single scandal, but
   addeth some glorious event and effect of it. Observe, then, two
   parts:--

   First, Christ's conflict.

   Secondly, Christ's conquest. The conflict is last in the order of the
   words, but first in order of nature and time.

   There observe that the scandal of Christ's conflict is reduced to four
   heads:--

   1. His death: he poured out Ms soul unto death.

   2. The ignominy of it: he was numbered with the transgressors.

   3. The cause of it, both of his death and ignominy: he bore the sins of
   many.

   4. The prayer, meekness, and patience of Christ, together with his
   desire of the application of this remedy: he made intercession for the
   transgressors.

   Secondly, For the conquest; there it is first hinted in the promise of
   the Father: I will divide him a portion with the great.

   2. The possession and enjoyment of the Son, what the Father would give,
   and what the Son shall enjoy: I will give him a portion with the great,
   and he shall divide the spoil with the strong. Or, if you will have it
   more particularly, you may consider it thus:--

   1. The ground of the conquest, implied in the causal particle,
   therefore.

   2. The donor or author of it, God the Father: I will divide.

   3. The reality of it, it was done; God the Son shall find this promise
   accomplished: he shall divide the spoil with the strong.

   4. The nature of the conquest; it is expressed by a portion with the
   great, and by dividing the spoil.

   5. From whom he shall take them: from the great and the strong.

   6. Others add the persons whom he shall admit into co-partnership in
   the conquest and spoils, as implied in that word, with the strong; how
   justly, we shall see by and by. Though you may now guess at the sense
   of the words by this explication of them into their parts, yet I shall
   give you some better satisfaction about the phrases before I let them
   pass.

   At this time, I shall insist upon the conquest, which, as I have
   observed, is last in nature and time, yet first in the order of the
   words. I shall pitch upon that now; and my first endeavour shall be to
   open it to you; for indeed, though most interpretations in their result
   and effect come to the same thing, yet I find they do not make it out
   one and the same way; so that the phrases need a vindication. Consider,
   then, that the intent of the prophet here is to set out the victory and
   triumph of the Messiah, which victory and triumph is here set out by
   terms proper to the triumphs of man. A general, when he hath scattered
   the enemies and driven them out of the field, securely seizeth upon the
   prey, and divideth it amongst his followers. The dividing of the spoils
   is a sign of conquest. Pharaoh, when he promised himself success, Exod.
   xv. 9, you know what he saith there: I will pursue, I will overtake, I
   will divide the spoil.' That is the custom of conquerors. So one of
   Sisera's mother's ladies: Have they not sped? have they not divided the
   prey?' As soon as they had borne down the enemies, and had any leisure,
   they were for distributing the booty. So the prophet Isaiah, speaking
   of the glad tidings of the gospel, saith to those that hear them, Isa.
   ix. 3, They joy before God according to the joy in harvest, and as men
   rejoice when they divide the spoil.' So Christ is here set forth as a
   conqueror, taking his portion, and dividing the spoil.

   I confess there is some difference in reading the words. Junius reads
   it, Partem ei dabo, ut cum robustis partiatur praedam--that he may
   divide the spoil with the strong.' Others, I will give him the part of
   many, and he shall divide the spoil of the strong.' Others, in, many,
   and over the strong, as a great man, or as a strong man useth to do
   after battle. I shall not intricate the discourse with these things,
   but by going over word by word make all plain; though for my part I
   conceive the phrases are put here as common and in general, and only
   implying a triumph. I will divide him a portion with the great, and
   divide the spoil with the strong;' that you shall see him as a great
   conqueror, and like the kings and potentates, and the great and strong
   ones of the earth, having a part in dividing the spoil.

   But it may be better to go over the text more particularly. I will
   divide him a portion with the great.' He is spoken of in the former
   verses, I will divide him a portion, or give him a part with the great,
   barabim, with many; so it may signify, and implieth the numerousness of
   those that Christ shall gain to himself among the nations; or the
   great, that is the powerful, whose power ruled the world. Not as if
   Christ and they should divide the world between them; that they should
   have a part and Christ should have a part: as some think, it implieth
   that Christ should have the elect, and Satan the rest. No, that is not
   the force of the word; but that Christ should come to parting; that is,
   to spoil Satan, for he is intended by the great and the strong,' though
   it also noteth and implieth all his instruments, who usually have the
   dignities and pomp of the world. Therefore, it is said, Col. ii. 14,
   15, that he spoiled principalities and powers;' Eph. iv. 8, He led
   captivity captive;' and Luke xi. 21, He disarmeth the strong man, and
   divideth the spoils.' I cannot conceal from you that some by this
   latter sentence, divide the spoil with the strong,' understand the
   godly, those that are called the violent, Mat. xi. 12, that with a
   great deal of fervour of spirit follow him, love him, confess him, and
   cleave to him, and will not give over for any dangers, lets, and
   difficulties. But, for method's sake, and reverence to those learned
   men that affect that sense, I shall take in that in the last place.

   The points, then, are:--

   1. From the causal particle, therefore. Observe--

   That the ground of Christ's triumph was his sufferings. Therefore--why?
   Because he laid down his soul an offering for sin, and hath borne our
   iniquities, as in the former verse; and it is again amplified in the
   latter end of this verse. And it is worth our observation, that always
   the sufferings and exaltation of Christ, when spoken of together, are
   expressed causally; as Ps. cx. 7, He shall drink of the brook in the
   way, therefore he shall lift up the head;' that is, drink up the lake
   of curses that divide between God and the elect. Mark the particle
   therefore. So John x. 17, Therefore doth my Father love me, because I
   lay down my life.' Therefore prevail: mark the inference, because.
   Phil. ii. 9, 10, He became obedient to death, even the death of the
   cross: wherefore God hath highly exalted him.' And John xii. 32, it is
   there expressed conditionally and federally: If I be lifted up from the
   earth, I will draw all men unto me;' that is, if I be lifted up upon
   the cross, then I shall have power to work the hearts of men to my
   obedience. So that you see Christ's exaltation did not only imply his
   humiliation, as in some places it only doth; as Eph. iv. 9, Now that he
   ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower
   parts of the earth?' It not only necessarily implieth and presupposeth
   it, but was caused by it, and merited by it. So Rev. v. 9, Thou art
   worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast
   slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.' To open the seals;
   that is, to open dark promises, and to do what was necessary for the
   illuminating of the church. Christ's humiliation and exaltation was not
   only an antecedent and a consequent, as some divines expound these
   places, and I myself formerly have done among you, but as a cause and
   effect, as merit and reward. Calvin indeed judgeth it a curious
   question whether Christ merited his conquest and trial; [12] and his
   reasons were, because there is no express scripture for it. But what
   shall we say then to those causal particles? But this he saith is a
   great derogation to the love of Christ, to make him eye himself in his
   sufferings; since it is said, The Messiah shall be cut off, but not for
   himself;' he eyed our good in it, and not his own.

   I answer, it maketh much for our comfort, that Christ had his
   conquests, and the privileges of his mediatorship in a way of justice
   and merit; that though all things are dispensed to us freely, yet to
   Christ justly. It is true, as it hath been handled by divers schoolmen,
   and as it is referred merely to the glorification of Christ's humanity,
   so it is a curious question; but as it importeth the carriage of all
   things appertaining to our comfort and salvation between God and Christ
   in a way of rigour and justice, so it maketh much for our comfort and
   consolation.

   Use 1. Here is a sealing of your comfort, it was merited by Christ: you
   can do nothing to merit it, but Christ did. What is free grace to you
   is due debt to Christ. Alas! what can you do to find so much grace with
   God as to prevail over Satan or your own spirit, to lift up the head in
   triumph, so as to be raised to glory? Though you cannot tell how, yet
   Christ did. God is bound in justice to Christ to do all these things
   for you. You have a double claim in God; you can lay hold of his
   mercies engaged by his promises to you, and of his justice engaged by
   the merits of Christ for you. Things are not now uncertain; Christ hath
   merited such a capacity as to bestow grace and glory and every good
   thing upon you. You cannot hope to prevail over Satan, but God hath
   indented with Christ; Therefore he shall divide a portion with the
   great, and divide the spoil with the strong.' You cannot hope for
   glorious privileges; alas! you are poor, vile, worthless creatures: but
   He drank of the brook in the way, therefore he shall lift up the head,'
   and your head too. You cannot look for the power of the Spirit to draw
   you to Christ; these are great comforts, but not for you: But if I be
   lifted up, I will draw all men after me.' Christ merited that privilege
   by his sufferings. You cannot open the book, neither can you find
   anything in yourselves to encourage you to hope for such a privilege;
   no more indeed you should not find any merit in yourselves, but seek it
   in another. Christ was worthy, for he was slain; and if you are
   Christ's, and Christ be yours, you are worthy, for you Lave his merit,
   though none of your own.

   2. If the ground of Christ's triumph were his death and sufferings,
   then here is great comfort to you in all your inward and outward
   abasements. Here is a double comfort, one to allay fear, and the other
   to encourage hope. To allay fear: be not dismayed, great abasements
   usually go before glory. And then to encourage hope; the greatest
   abasements will turn to the greatest glory. Christ's death and
   sufferings were not only the antecedent, but the cause of his conquest
   and exaltation. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great.'
   Consider with yourselves:--

   [1.] Great abasements often go before glory. This was the dispensation
   God used to Christ: Luke xxiv. 26, Ought not Christ to suffer these
   things, and then to enter into glory?' and will not you take it well at
   the hands of God to drink of Christ's cup, to be first crowned with
   thorns before you be crowned with glory, to be humbled before
   converted; to be slurred with the bishop's coal-dust before you be
   shining platters upon God's shelf, as that martyr said; to be full of
   wants before you be full of Christ? What is your abasement? If you look
   inward, you have a vile heart, a destitute, naked soul, no grace, but
   much corruption; therefore there are some hopes of crumbs when you find
   yourself a dog; as the woman of Canaan maketh it a motive, Mat. xv. 27.
   Oh, be not discouraged! Blessed be God, he that humbleth himself shall
   be exalted. There is no sentence repeated so often in the New Testament
   as that, Prov. xv. 33, Before honour is humility.' This is the Lord's
   course, to make us poor in spirit, and then rich in grace. But is the
   trouble outward? Are you low in the world, of base account and esteem?
   Oh, remember, Jesus Christ was first accounted a glutton, a
   wine-bibber, one that had a devil in the eye of the world, and then had
   a name above all names. Mordecai was first envied for sitting at the
   king's gate, and then honoured by his adversary with sitting upon the
   king's horse. Job was brought from a large estate to the very dust,
   because God would bless his latter end more than his beginning, Job
   xlii. 12. As Samuel saith to Saul, 1 Sam. xv. 17, When thou wast little
   in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of
   Israel?' It may be God hath more eminent providences for you after your
   great abasement.

   [2.] This should be so far from being a discouragement, that it is a
   ground of hope. Usually we get great advantage by our sufferings.
   Consider the conflict of Christ upon the cross, his cross was his
   triumph; like Sampson, he destroyed more enemies at his death than in
   all his life; his cross was his chariot of triumph: Col. ii. 15, And
   having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them
   openly, triumphing over them in it.' Therefore I will divide him a
   portion with the great,' because made so small: James i. 9, Let the
   brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted.' Your abasement is
   your preferment and exaltation: 2 Cor. i. 5, As the sufferings of
   Christ abound in us, so our consolation aboundeth in Christ.' The
   greatest grace meets with the greatest conflicts, because it is the
   greatest grace. This is so sure a truth, that even their spiritual
   abasements, their falls, their sins, do work for their good; the soul
   groweth the more humble, holy and watchful. Paul was the more fervent
   and frequent with God in prayer because of the messenger of Satan, 2
   Cor. xii. 10. David came to number the people, and by that means came
   to know where the temple should be built, which he so earnestly desired
   to know. Hezekiah was the more humble for his fall, 2 Chron. xxxii. 31;
   he knew all that was in his heart. But especially it holdeth good in
   outward abasements; they are cause of more good to their souls. The
   setting of the day-star maketh way for the sun-rising, and the loss of
   some petty comfort for their abundant consolation in Jesus Christ.

   I shall now come to the author and donor, God the Father: I will divide
   a portion with the great, and divide the spoil with the strong.'

   Doct. That the power and majesty whereby Jesus Christ overcame his
   enemies was by the gift and appointment of the Father: Ps. cx. 1, The
   Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I have made
   thine enemies thy footstool;' that is, God the Father said to Christ.
   And Ps. ii. 6, I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.' Christ
   was a king of God's making. So the Father hath committed all judgment
   to the Son, John v. 22. All the supremacy, power, and majesty that
   Christ had as Mediator was derived from the Father. So Mat. xxviii. 18,
   All power is given to me both in heaven and earth.' Christ's power was
   given to him, and it was meet it should be so.

   The condition on God the Father's part was to honour the Son for the
   elect's sake; and the Son had glorified the Father, John xvii. 4, by
   virtue of the compact and agreement between them. And besides, we could
   not take so much comfort in the advancement of Christ unless we had the
   consent of the Father. The love of every person was to appear to the
   creature, especially the love of the offended person; sin in its last
   result being against the Father: hence it is so often said that he hath
   given him a name above all names;' that he hath put all things in
   subjection.' And therefore it is a mighty pledge of God's love to the
   creature, and of what God will do for us, now our nature is advanced to
   such high and glorious privileges. Not only God the Son was willing,
   who assumed our nature in his own person, but God the Father was
   willing to do it.

   Use 1. To direct us to stick to God's choice and appointment. He hath
   honoured Jesus Christ to be the king of his church: Luke xxii. 29, I
   appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me a
   kingdom.' And therefore we should honour him, and acknowledge no other.
   God chose Adam a wife in paradise, and he chose a husband to the
   church, who is bone of our bone: and therefore we should honour him as
   the captain of our salvation. Now God hath honoured him, and put all
   things in subjection to him: Hosea i. 11, it is said, They shall
   appoint themselves one head;' Eph. i. 22, And gave him to be head over
   all things to the church.' Thus shall it be done to them whom the king
   delighteth to honour. Thus shall it be done to the person whom God will
   honour, that has such faith, dependence, reverence, and confidence.
   They appoint him whom God hath appointed. You do as it were anew honour
   Jesus Christ, when your dependence on him is according to the honour
   the Father hath put upon him. 2 Sam. xvi. 18, as Hushai said, Whom the
   Lord shall choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.' God the
   Father hath chosen him; look to him as your head, king, and husband, as
   the captain of your salvation, the author and finisher of your faith.
   God hath divided him a portion with the great.

   2. It teacheth us to glorify the Father in our thoughts, expressions,
   and affections, for the honour that he hath put upon Jesus Christ. The
   person that is most in our eye usually intercepts all the love and
   praise of the creature. Though you can never enough honour and magnify
   the person of Jesus Christ, yet do not exclude the person of the
   Father. The persons in the Trinity mutually glorify one another, and
   why should not we? In every glorious manifestation of the power of
   Christ, send up a thankful thought, some acknowledgment of love and
   praise to the Father. As Paul: Rom. vii. 24, 25, Who shall deliver me
   from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our
   Lord.' It is accomplished by the power God hath put upon Jesus Christ.
   Look upon what terms the scriptures do pitch all comfort and
   expectation upon the person of Christ: 2 Cor. i. 20, For all the
   promises of God in him are yea, and in him amen, unto the glory of God
   by us.' There is the end why all is in Christ. So Phil. ii. 11: And
   that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
   glory of God the Father.' Mark, the person of Christ can never be
   enough in our thoughts, nor mentioned in our mouths, for he is the
   Lord; but it is to the glory of the Father. As often as you remember
   the work of your redemption, remember the work of the Father, and then
   you will find your hearts raised in thankfulness and love to him.
   Christ himself, when he saw poor souls receive the gospel, though he
   saith there the power of dispensing was committed to him, Mat. xi. 25,
   compared with 27, yet he saith, Father, I thank thee that thou hast
   revealed it to them.' See if your hearts be raised and ravished within
   you with this eternal and free love of God to the glory of the Father.

   3. It is a great ground of trust and confidence, when you go to God in
   prayer to turn your captivity, for power against your spiritual
   adversaries, as sin, Satan, fears of death, and hell; or earthly ones,
   as unjust and tyrannous encroachments without. Urge it to God, did not
   he divide Christ a portion with the great? You desire but to exalt the
   king of his own making, a king upon his holy hill. Was it not thine own
   grant and donation? When we come and urge God's own acts upon him, and
   he urgeth it to God, you shall see he will own them. The apostle
   alludeth to that of the Psalms, in Heb. ii. 8, Thou didst set him over
   the work of thine hands; thou hast put all things in subjection under
   his feet.' And why not my sins and mine enemies? But alas! We see not
   yet all things put under him;' it is not yet made good to our sense and
   experience. Lusts are stirring and Satan busy. Lord, didst thou not
   say, that all things should be put under him? Go to God, and do but
   press him with his own appointment.

   I now come to the third particular, and that is the reality of this
   conquest. It was not only promised by God the Father, but God the Son
   was possessed of it: He shall divide the spoil with the strong.'

   Doct. That the Lord Jesus was a glorious conqueror.

   Dividing of the spoil is the effect of a sure and a great conquest. You
   may perceive that in all respects it maketh a victory glorious. You
   know the eminency of it lieth in these four things:--

   1. Either in the power of the adversaries. There is no triumph in
   prevailing over weak things: 1 Sam. xxvi. 20, For the king of Israel is
   come out to seek a flea, as one doth hunt a partridge in the
   mountains.' What honour could Saul get to seek a flea, or hunt a
   partridge in the mountains,--to chase hares or harts?

   2. By the unlikelihood of the means. A thousand men were slain by the
   jaw-bone of an ass by the hands of Sampson; and a numerous host
   discomfited by Gideon's pitchers and three hundred lamps. Such things
   as these make the success memorable.

   3. The manner or nature of the victory. Total defeats are most noted. A
   slight hurt, or some petty brush is nothing, as Amalek's falling upon
   the weak rear, and putting the hindermost stragglers to shame; what is
   that? The conquest is not complete till there be a dissipation and
   dissolution of the whole force that is against us.

   4. A conquest is glorious in the effects or result of it. If it be of
   great importance and consequence to the good of a people, when fears
   are removed, and privileges are granted and enlarged, spoilers taken, a
   kingdom subdued,--these things make for the glory of the victory. And,
   therefore, let us see if such things be not found in the conquest of
   Christ. There are strong adversaries and weak means, glorious
   achievements and great effects and fruits of this conquest, for the
   benefit of the faithful; and therefore he was a glorious conqueror.

   First, The adversaries; they are mighty. They are always expressed by
   such notions as do imply great strength and power: Col. ii. 15, it is
   said, He spoiled principalities and powers.' The evil angels, by reason
   of their power and prevalency in and with the world, are expressed by
   that name, principalities and powers.' So Eph. iv. 8, He led captivity
   captive;' that is, he captivated enemies such as are apt to bring us
   into bondage. It is as much as if it were said, he prevailed over
   victory,--he led captivity itself captive. And he is called the strong
   man, Luke xi. 21.

   But let us a little more particularly consider the enemies, and then we
   shall see how much they add to the glory and renown of the conquest.

   1. There is the devil, who is a powerful adversary. He causeth great
   disturbance to the people of God, either to the called or uncalled. He
   either accuseth us, or soliciteth us to evil. He accuseth the called
   and converted, and so filleth their souls with disquieting, doubtful
   thoughts. Ay! but the prince of this world is judged,' John xvi. 11.
   God hath condemned him for an accuser; God hath condemned him for
   condemning you: and when he cometh to resist you at the time you are
   about the work of God, judgment is passed upon the liar who would cause
   you to misjudge yourselves. Sometimes he soliciteth to evil; injects
   carnal and provoking thoughts. Ay! but Satan is rebuked: Zech. iii. 2,
   And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee.' There is grace to
   check and oppose him. But Satan chiefly worketh upon the uncalled
   people of God--men in their unregeneracy and sinful estate; he
   possesseth their hearts, and worketh in the children of disobedience,'
   Eph. ii. 3, detaining them in blindness, captivates and subjects them
   to the power of their lusts, and so by this means possesseth the most
   part of the world by ignorance and superstition, or else causeth them
   to hold the truth in unrighteousness; and erects strongholds, partly by
   ignorance, partly by error and superstition, and partly by lusts and
   violent temptations, which he darts forth that he may keep the world in
   his obedience. But now the prince of this world is cast out,' John xii.
   31. Satan is dispossessed, and his power vacated, his rule disannulled.
   Great Pan is dead, being like Dagon brought upon his face in the
   presence of the ark. And so, some stories say, the idols were
   overturned at the time of Christ's birth. Certain we are, spiritually
   it is true, if not fulfilled in a literal miracle. Thus Satan is an
   enemy.

   2. The law, that was an enemy, as it condemns us; the law of ordinances
   was against us. Now Christ hath abolished it, so far as it was contrary
   and prejudicial to our acceptance with God, as it made for our
   discomfort and condemnation, and bound us to wrath, and to such
   obedience as could not be fulfilled by us: Col. ii. 14, Blotting out
   the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary
   to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.' Christ
   contended with the law, and took us out of the hands of it, abrogated
   the curse and rigour of it. Alas! we were all a prey to the law, till
   Christ did arise and plead our cause, and removed the curse and the
   difficulties of obedience, and made the craggy hill to become a plain
   to us. He slew the enmity by his cross.' Eph. ii. 16. Now, as great an
   enemy as the law was to us, it was by God's appointment, and it may be
   thought much that God should abrogate his own law. Christ was not only
   to deal with rebels, but with his Father's appointments, that he might
   abolish them so far as there was any enmity and contrariety in them, to
   our good.

   3. Death and hell. I join them both together, because the scripture
   doth so often. Of all enemies, these are the most potent and severe,
   yet are overcome by Christ. Christ, conquering the law, must needs
   conquer death: The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is
   the law.' By Christ death is made a friend, as Haman served Mordecai.
   It doth but help us to honour and advancement: 1 Cor. xv. 54, Death is
   swallowed up in victory,'--destroyed and brought to nothing. We may
   outdare death, it cannot harm us, it doth but midwife us into glory.
   And then for hell, the mouth of it is shut up, so that it serveth only
   as an aggravation of our mercies: Rev. xx. 6, Blessed and holy is he
   that hath part in the first resurrection; over such the second death
   hath no power;' 2 Tim. i. 10, He hath abolished death,'--overthrew it.
   When the fears of death encroach upon our spirits, you may see a stone
   rolled upon the mouth of hell by Jesus Christ: Rev. i. 18, I am alive
   for evermore, and have the keys of death and hell;' and Rev. xx. 14,
   Death and hell are cast into the lake of fire.' What comfort is this
   for those that have an interest in Christ, that Christ hath the keys of
   death and hell!

   4. The flesh. Corruption is a bosom-enemy, that insinuates with us, and
   worketh upon us in our most pleasing desires: Rom. viii. 7, The carnal
   mind is enmity to God;' and Gal. v. 17, The flesh lusteth against the
   spirit.' It is a great trouble to a gracious heart. Though it be flesh,
   as dear to us as our own skin, yet it is a thorn in the flesh, a great
   cumber to a gracious heart. Nehemiah was very much troubled with his
   adversaries, because divers about him that abode with him held secret
   correspondence with his enemies, Neh. viii. 18. So we carry somewhat
   about us that complies with Satan. Rebellious lusts, and vicious
   affections, and proud thoughts swarm in our hearts, to the disdain of
   the yoke of Christ: 2 Cor. x. 5, Casting down imaginations, and every
   high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and
   bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.' But
   it is said, Rom. viii. 3, God sending his own Son in the likeness of
   sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh.' O beloved! sin
   in your flesh is rooted in your corrupt desires; but it is a condemned
   thing, and it will be executed. Mat. xii. 20, A bruised reed shall he
   not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he bring forth
   judgment unto victory.' He will make the cross triumphant.

   5. The world,--take it either for the baits and allurements, or the
   concernments and interests of it, anything that may be dangerous to us
   in the work of our salvation. But Christ hath overcome the malignity of
   it. Christ would put all out of doubt and danger: John xvi. 33, Be of
   good cheer, I have overcome the world.' Height shall not separate no
   more than depth, neither favour nor frowns. Christ hath taken away the
   noxiousness and harm of everything that may be propounded to us.

   6. All the adverse powers in the world. Stubborn enemies are sometimes
   armed with power: Rev. xvii. 14, These shall make war with the Lamb;'
   that is, the kings of the earth. This is a great terror, when a man
   seeth all the combined force of a nation, all the force, authority, and
   strength combined against Christ: Ps. cx. 6, He shall wound the heads
   over many countries, and strike through kings in the day of his wrath;'
   and Ps. ii. 10-12, Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed,
   ye judges of the earth: serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with
   trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
   when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put
   their trust in him.' A little wrath will destroy a great person.
   Sometimes our enemies are enraged with malice. Herod being vexed at the
   wise men's words, he vowed revenge; but, alas! he could not overcome
   Christ in his cradle. What will they do now he is in heaven, out of
   their reach? Ps. cxxiv. 3, They had swallowed us up quick, when their
   wrath was kindled against us;' that is, when their courage is
   heightened by wrath. Ps. lxxvi. 10, Surely the wrath of man shall
   praise thee;' i.e., shall keep an holyday. This wrath shall serve the
   design of Christ, for God will make every stiff knee to bow, Phil. ii.
   10. Alas! fear surpriseth us when a provoked enemy cometh with rage and
   fury, as if like a flood he would bear all before him. But this may
   occasion a day of praise to God. And then sometimes your enemies are
   advantaged with wit, wealth, and all outward sufficiencies and
   supplies: Luke xvi. 8, The children of this world are wiser in their
   generation than the children of light;' that is, more dexterous in the
   course of their affairs. And Mat. xi. 26, the things of Christianity
   are hidden from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes.' So Ps.
   lxiv. 6, They search out iniquity, they accomplish a diligent search;
   but the inward thought of every one of them and the heart is deep.'
   They may be men of great parts, pregnant invention, full of politic
   enterprises; ay! but all this is nothing: Job v. 13, He taketh the wise
   in their own craftiness.' Christ hath died to recover the truth, and to
   free the souls of his servants from such kinds of assaults as these.
   These are the enemies that are most stubborn, but they are forced to
   stoop, though they are advantaged with power, armed with malice, and
   stored with all outward sufficiencies.

   Thus you see the enemies whose opposition adds to the glory of the
   conquest: the devil, the law, death and hell, the flesh and the world,
   and all the adverse powers and dominations that are combined against
   Christ. Christ can have no spoil, no prey, no kingdom, no saints, till
   he had combated with these enemies; their opposition addeth to the
   renown of the conquest.

   Secondly, Let us look to the means. The weapons of this warfare are not
   carnal; that is, there is little pomp and appearance in them. Look upon
   them, and the matter will be the more wonderful.

   1. As to his death. His very conflict was his triumph. The Lamb
   overcometh, and Christ conquered Satan, and sin, and the law, when they
   seemed to have most power upon him; like angry bees that sting others
   and disarm themselves. When Satan had the greatest hand over Christ,
   Christ overcame him: Heb. ii. 14, That through death he might destroy
   him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.' Satan lost his
   life in his sting. It is observable, that the scripture twice or thrice
   mentioneth it as a remarkable circumstance that Christ triumphed in his
   cross: Col. ii. 15, Triumphing over them in it.' So Eph. ii. 16, Having
   slain enmity thereby;' that is, the cross spoken of before, when he was
   slain himself. His cross is in two places expressed by lifting up: John
   iii. 14, Even so the Son of man shall be lifted up;' and John xii. 32,
   And I, if I be lifted up from the earth.' Indeed it was his preferment
   and exaltation.

   2. By the word of the cross, called the foolishness of preaching: Ps.
   viii. 2, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast ordained
   strength.' Weak men, whose strength is in their Messiah, may bring men
   upon their faces by a sermon: 1 Cor. xiv. 25, And thus are the secrets
   of his heart made manifest; and falling down upon his face, he will
   worship God, and report, saying, God is in you of a truth.' And recover
   the world unto his obedience by these arts: Mat. iv. 23, Jesus went
   about preaching the gospel of the kingdom.' And his kingdom is gained
   by that, and it maketh much for the heightening of the conquest.

   3. By his Spirit: Zech. iv. 6, Not by might, nor by power, but by my
   Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.' A great force, but secret and
   undiscerned; mighty to humble, mighty to comfort, mighty to convert and
   save. The little finger of the Spirit is heavier than the loins of our
   reasoning, and debates with our souls. Jerusalem is purged by the
   Spirit: Jer. iv. 4, Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away
   the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah, and inhabitants of
   Jerusalem, lest my fury come forth like fire.'

   4. By his prayers and intercessions: Zech. iii. 2, And the Lord said
   unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath
   chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee.' Christ prayeth Satan into nothing. All
   the merit of Christ is made effectual by his prayers, and all the
   efficacy of Christ's death and satisfaction is applied and conveyed to
   us by the Spirit; and thereby we have the spiritual virtue of Christ's
   prayers: John xiv. 16, I will pray the Father, and he will send you
   another Comforter.' All the actual application is by the power of the
   Spirit, obtained by the intercession of Christ: Luke xvii. 20, 21, The
   kingdom of God cometh not with observation, neither shall they say, Lo
   here, lo there: behold the kingdom of God is within you.' Well, then,
   these are the arts and engines that Christ useth for the gaining of the
   world and spoiling of his adversaries; his death, his word, his Spirit
   obtained by his prayer. Some take in other things, sometimes God
   ruineth them by themselves,. Satan by his own instruments, by their
   subtilty, and sometimes other ways; but the cause and ground of all are
   the death, and prayers, and Spirit of Christ; there lieth his strength,
   and this is a strange and glorious conquest.

   Thirdly, The manner or nature of the conquest, how it is achieved and
   accomplished. See what a conquest it is.

   1. The enemies are overcome and terribly broken; there is a total
   dissipation of all the powers of darkness. It is expressed in scripture
   by bruising the head of Satan,. Gen. iii. 15, Christ received a slight
   hurt in the conflict; his heel was bruised, but the serpent's head is
   broken: 1 John iii. 8, The Son of man came to dissolve the works of the
   devil.' All the fabric of iniquity is analysed and dissolved,--all the
   webs and plots of wickedness are unravelled. The dragon is cast out,
   Rev. xii. 9, being combated by Michael and his angels. Sin is condemned
   in the flesh, Rom. viii. 3. Corruptions captivated, 2 Cor. x. 5. The
   world overcome, John xvi. 33. Wicked and adverse powers and dominations
   in the world broken to pieces and grounded to powder, or else gained
   and forced to yield to the uses and glory of Christ.

   2. Not barely overcome and dissipated, though that were much, but
   spoiled and rifled. Christ hath divided the prey: Col. ii. 15, And
   having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them
   openly, triumphing over them in it.' They are spoiled by disarming the
   strong man, and dividing his spoils, Luke xi. 22. God hath spoiled and
   dispossessed Satan of the souls that were taken captive by him at his
   pleasure; they are recovered into the glorious liberty of the sons of
   God. The nations are got from under his obedience, and subdued to the
   power of the gospel. So death and hell are under his power; they are,
   as it were, under lock and key, Satan had the power of them heretofore,
   and then men were always under bondage: Heb. ii. 14, 15, That through
   death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the
   devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life
   time subject to bondage.' They durst not think of judgment and hell,
   because Satan had them in his power as God's executioner; but now,
   saith Christ, I have the keys of death.' The world is despoiled of all
   its wit, wealth, glory, and power; these are made to serve the uses of
   Christ, being recovered out of the chains of wicked men: Micah iv. 13,
   And thou shalt beat in pieces many nations, and shalt consecrate their
   gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole
   earth;' Zech. xiv. 14, 20, The wealth of the nations shall be gathered
   together. . . . And upon the bells of the horses and the pots in
   Jerusalem there shall be written, holiness to the Lord.' All this is
   done so clearly to the eye of faith, that they do even see Christ
   triumphing: Isa. lxiii. 1, Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed
   garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling
   in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty
   to save.'

   3. Such a victory as endeth in a solemn triumph; as conquerors in
   public view carried their spoils and their enemies tied to their
   chariots, so Christ would expose them to open shame. Therefore, it is
   said, Eph. iv. 8, He led captivity captive,' as it were in triumph, as
   you do manacled prisoners. So Col ii. 15, He made a show of them
   openly;' he put them to open shame. How so?--before God and the eyes of
   believers. We may see the triumphant chariot of Christ, and Satan, hell
   and death, and the world haled after it. As soon as the soul is
   possessed of Christ, and beginneth to have some interest in him, it
   feels this benefit, and seeth how these things are captivated by the
   death, Spirit, and power of Christ. Christ doth, as it were, call upon
   your souls, Come, look! here is Satan disarmed, death unstinged, hell
   shut up, and I have the keys; sin is manacled, wrath satisfied, the
   law's curse and rigour taken out of the way, heady enemies despoiled
   and discouraged, the world subdued and brought to my obedience, or
   forced to serve my glory. So that you see the conquest is full and
   absolute.

   Object. But you will say, I feel none of these things; why are these
   enemies so busy and cumbersome about my soul, if totally dissipated by
   Christ?

   I answer briefly in these considerations:--

   1. It is true in faith, though not in sense and feeling, that these
   adversaries received their death's wound at the death of Christ. This
   was done in the merit of Christ, and in God's decree and ordination.
   Christ was possessed of this promise of having a portion with the
   great, and to divide the spoil with the strong; all things were put
   under his feet. The crown was put upon the head of Jesus Christ, though
   it be not effectually made out to sense. There is the objection from
   sense: Heb. ii. 8, But now we see not all things put under him.'

   2. Though it be so that these things are left for a while, it is partly
   to exercise our souls, and to draw forth the life of our graces.
   Opposition keeps the soul humble and wakeful. Paul had a thorn in the
   flesh, and a messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he should be
   exalted above measure, 2 Cor. xii. 7. It is partly to prove us, to see
   if we will enter into the battle, and powerfully maintain it, and
   combat against the enemies of Christ; and partly to make us the more
   thankful for our deliverance by Christ. Christ was tempted like us,
   that he might be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and that
   we might be touched with a feeling of Christ's sufferings, and the
   greatness of Christ's love to us. Experience maketh us the more
   sensible how it would have been with us, if we had not been freed by
   the Son of God. Oh, when we are a little scorched with wrath, when we
   tug with sin, we may begin to think what it is to dwell with
   everlasting burning. How would it have been if Christ had not died for
   us? So when there are difficulties abroad, what should we have done
   with these mountains, if it had not been for our Zerubbabel? Experience
   giveth us the best sense of things, therefore the Lord saw fit to
   continue these things for a season. As it is said of Daniel's beasts,
   Dan. vii. 12, that their dominion was taken away,' though their lives
   was prolonged for a season.' So their power to hurt or endamage our
   salvation is gone: 1 Peter iii. 13, And who is he that will harm you?'
   Nothing shall separate you from the love of God,' Rom. viii. 33.
   Neither death, nor hell, nor sin, shall prejudice the salvation of the
   elect; Satan can not ruin, death cannot disannul it; hell hath no
   right, and sin hath no reign; the world may kill us, but they cannot
   conquer us.

   3. Though continued, they cannot harm us, rather they may do us good.
   Even sin and Satan may give us cause to glory in infirmities, 2 Cor.
   xii. 10, to boast of our weakness: they may occasion such supplies and
   comforts from God; but certain we are they cannot hurt our souls nor
   hinder our salvation.

   4. The work will be thoroughly and completely done ere long; our
   comforts and hopes in Christ will prove sure: Rev. xii. 11, They over
   came by the blood of the Lamb.' We do not as yet see all things put
   under him.' Heb. ii. 8. Mark, that as yet implies it is at hand. We do
   not as yet see the god of this world fully cast out and falling as
   lightning from heaven; we do not as yet find sin fully mortified, Satan
   subdued, Christ exalted among all the nations; none of these things are
   as yet completely done. But here is the comfort of believers: Horn,
   xvi. 20, The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.'
   All this will be done, and will not you tarry a little while? As the
   church saith, Micah vii. 8, 9, Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy;
   when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a
   light unto me. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have
   sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for
   me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall be hold his
   righteousness.' Times will be better and hearts better.

   5. If we do find and feel no benefit by the conquest of Christ, it is
   through our-own corruptions. God hath not left us for the present with
   out some sense of it. You will have some rule over your hearts and
   spirits, more grace to resist Satan, more comfort against the fear of
   death, and less trouble about the difficulties of obedience: 1 John v.
   4, Whosoever is born of God overcometh the world.' Thus you see we have
   gone through the third part, that is, a complete victory, even to the
   spoiling and triumphing over Satan, who shall be totally subdued.

   Fourthly, The next and last thing proposed was the fruits and effects,
   or what special benefit we have by the conquest of Christ.

   I answer--It is hard to mention all the rich communications of grace
   that we enjoy by it. Those that are most proper are these:--

   1. The banishment of distracting fear: holy fear remaineth, but that
   natural fear which would distract and perplex the soul is gone. The
   apostle speaks, Heb. ii. 15, of some who, through fear of death, were
   all their lifetime subject to bondage.' There is a natural fear in us;
   though not always felt, yet it is easily awakened, so as we could not
   think of death, or hell, or judgment, but it filled us with a great
   deal of terror. But now a child of God hath a great deal of courage and
   boldness; he may remember it to increase his joy and praise; he can
   play upon the hole of the cockatrice; death and hell may aggravate his
   mercies, but cannot increase his fears; so that they are fitted for the
   worst condition and the greatest duty: Ps. xxiii. 4, Though I walk
   through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.' They
   are fitted for the sorest suffering and the greatest service. In the
   sorest affliction they may be comforted; hell-gates are shut, and
   Christ hath locked them up. So for the greatest service: Luke i. 74,
   75, That being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might
   serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all
   the days of our life.' It is a mighty weakening to the hands of the
   soul in duty, when we ponder upon the danger and difficulties, and the
   powerful opposition we shall meet with in the ways of grace. Ay! but
   now we may serve him without fear; Christ hath conquered death and
   hell, lusts and fears. We can the better bear afflictions now they are
   unstinged, and their venom taken away. We can the better go through
   duty; the joy of the Lord may be our strength; the enemies are fallen
   before us.

   2. It is an encouragement to the spiritual conflict. The difficulty of
   things amuseth [13] the heart, and causeth the spirit to faint and melt
   within us. Thus vigorous opposition within, without giants and the sons
   of Anak, Satan and wicked men, our own hearts and all are against us.
   Oh! but be not dismayed, you are sure to overcome; you fight against a
   manacled enemy, a naked enemy, a vanquished enemy. Mice may trample
   upon a dead lion, and the feeblest creatures insult a dead carcase.
   Will you fear Satan in chains? He is bound up; he was let loose upon
   Christ, and hath been bound up ever since. Be strong in the Lord, and
   in the power of his might.' Eph. vi. 10. God is at our right hand, and
   he will assist us in our endeavours against Satan; yon may go on with
   hope and resolution: Ps. cx. 5, The Lord at thy right hand shall strike
   through kings in the day of his wrath.' Hope of success is a strength
   and encouragement to an undertaking.

   3. Here is joy unspeakable and glorious. Christ's triumphs are our joy.
   Oh, what a triumph, even to exaltation, is it to see Satan despoiled
   and trampled upon, sin disarmed, and hell locked up! Luke i. 47, My
   spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.' Oh, you may triumph over the
   powers of darkness: Isa. li. 11, Therefore the redeemed of the Lord
   shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy
   shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and
   sorrow and mourning shall flee away.' Why? because the Lord hath smote
   Rahab, and wounded the dragon. Spiritual enemies being destroyed, we
   may make our boast of Christ all the day long.

   4. Hopes of glory: we shall conquer with him, and we shall reign with
   him. There is nothing that can be noxious and hurtful to our salvation.
   Christ will not leave till he hath settled us upon his own throne: Rev.
   iii. 21, To him that overcometh, will I grant to sit with me on my
   throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his
   throne.' We shall have fellowship with Christ in his glory, as Christ
   as Mediator had fellowship with the Father's glory; we shall have the
   throne of Christ, as Christ has that of his Father. He led captivity
   captive, and then ascended; so he will cause us to conquer and
   overcome: Eph. ii. 6, He hath raised us up together, and made us sit
   together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.' Conquerors enter after
   the spoil into the secure possession of their kingdoms; so did Jesus
   Christ, and so shall we.

   5. Great comfort accrueth and redoundeth to us by it; the very
   exaltation of Christ is a great comfort to us. We are happy in the
   success of our Prince, and we have interest in a great conqueror, in
   Michael, the great prince, Dan. xii. 1. As Joshua put his feet upon the
   necks of the kings, Josh. x. 24; so our Joshua, our Jesus, calleth to
   the captains and men of war with him, to come and set their feet upon
   the necks of their enemies. Nay, the apostle seemeth to express it, as
   if he did invest us in a surplusage of privileges: Rom. viii. 37, We
   are more than conquerors, through him that loved us;' and 2 Cor. ii.
   14, Now thanks be unto God, who always causeth us to triumph in
   Christ.' We have such a glorious Saviour as can help and stead his
   followers. Therefore, you maybe always boasting.

   6. There is this fruit and effect of Christ's conquest; it is a token,
   earnest, and pledge of our victory. Everything is first done in Christ,
   then in us; he died, rose, and conquered as our common person: John
   xvi. 33, Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.' What is that to
   us? Christ hath overcome, and that is a sign you shall overcome too: 1
   John v. 4, For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world; and this
   is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.' First
   Christ, and then your faith. There will something be done
   proportionably in your souls. God chose him, therefore he is called his
   Elect servant,' Isa. xlii. 1. And he hath chosen us, John xv. 16, But I
   have chosen you.' He calleth him. Christ took this honour when called,
   then we; Christ dieth, and we die; he was justified in the Spirit, then
   he riseth and ascendeth, so do we; he conquereth, so do we.

   7. What Christ did in this conquest, he did it for our sakes. He will
   have nothing but we shall share in it. If God give him a portion with
   the great, he will divide it with the strong: Luke xxii. 29, I appoint
   unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.' Mark, Christ
   would have you have the same privileges as he hath: John xii. 30, This
   voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.' Christ eyed us in
   his actions: John xvii. 22, And the glory which thou gavest me, I have
   given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.' Christ would
   have you come and ride with him in his triumphant chariot, and spoil
   principalities and powers.

   8. Another benefit is usefulness and serviceableness of all that
   befalls us. Christ doth so effect it that all things work together for
   good, Rom. viii. 28. The crooked sticks help to make the faggot the
   more decent. You do not only get a prey from Satan and your sins, but
   they yield you some good, and you may glory in infirmities, and desire
   to close with him, and cleave to him.

   Use. I did here and there interpose matter applicative, but now I shall
   come to it more formally. The uses concern the people of God, or the
   adversaries of Christ.

   1. To the people of Christ: Behave yourselves towards him as a
   conqueror.

   [L] Get an interest in him. Oh, who would not strive to get an interest
   in Christ, that he may have a share in his spoils? Who would not be one
   of the angels and followers of Michael, the great prince? He preserveth
   the souls of his people,' Ps. xcvii. 10. There is safety under the
   shadow of his wings. Therefore, apply your souls to this matter. You
   that think of Christ for a Lord, get your interest cleared. The soul is
   encumbered with fears for want of clearing up its right in Christ, and
   entertains these comforts with a loose heart for want of that. The soul
   is apt to say, Oh, if I were Christ's, then the matter were at end, and
   therefore, get it cleared up. How sweetly then can you reason and
   argue, This is my Christ, this is he that died for me: whilst others
   must be persuaded to seek Christ, and to cleave to him. We all desire
   to be of the strongest side: consider it, Jesus Christ is a glorious
   conqueror.

   [2.] Believe in him, and depend on him to possess your souls of these
   glorious privileges. Luther saith, carnal men hear these comforts quasi
   somniantes--like golden dreams, rare things, but presented to fancy
   rather than faith. Oh, stir up the large and sure apprehensions of
   faith. These things require a wakeful and believing soul, to see Christ
   conquering, triumphing, and spoiling the powers of darkness. Spiritual
   conquests must be discerned with a spiritual eye: Luke viii. 10, To you
   it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom.' Other men may hear
   them, but you know the mysteries. Oh, it is a great privilege
   vouchsafed, that when others only hear the voice, you see the glory;
   you see him leading captivity captive. It is in your eye that the
   powers of darkness are put to an open shame. You see the conqueror
   coming from Bozrah, the blood of his garments that cutteth off his
   enemies; all this is easily made out to your faith. Oh, therefore,
   depend upon him in all your assaults and straits; do not think to help
   and relieve yourselves by your own wit and parts; put forth endeavours,
   but do not rest in them; disclaim your own strength: Isa. xxx. 15, For
   thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest
   shall ye be saved, in quietness and in confidence shall be your
   strength.' The less the creature bustles, and the more it believeth,
   the more safe. Pray and wait in quietness and confidence that you are
   safe. The Philistines placed much confidence in their Goliah: oh! what
   hopes will you pitch upon Jesus Christ, the great conqueror!

   [3]. Check vain fears of death and hell, Satan, lusts, and the world.
   Alas! there is no more spirit left in these things; they are like the
   Canaanites which were stung by God's hornets before the Israelites
   conquered them: I will send my hornets before you.' Fear possessed
   them, and then they were easily vanquished. Christ hath not only stung
   them, but broke them in pieces. Will you fear shattered forces? Nay,
   Christ hath not only broken them, but disarmed them, and not only
   disarmed them, but bound them; and who would fear naked and chained
   enemies? Children are frightened at the sight of enemies, though bound.
   Oh, be not such children in grace! You shall find often in scripture
   that this is brought in as a just inference out of Christ's conquest:
   Fear not, I have overcome the world.' Some are careless, and fear
   nothing; others, that mind the danger of their souls, are very apt to
   be surprised with carnal trouble when they think of death, and hell,
   and wrath; and altogether it proveth a great consternation to their
   thoughts: but be not troubled, Ye believe in God, believe also in me,'
   John xiv. 1. When you think of God and Christ together, God satisfying,
   and Christ suffering, oh! what an amulet is there, what a cordial for
   fainting souls! Timorousness in a Christian is a disgrace to Christ.
   Understand what fears I mean; not a cautelous fear to avoid sin, to
   shun danger, to put us upon seasonable provisions against evil, but a
   perplexing fear, such as filleth the soul with amazement. Cautelous
   fear maketh the soul run to Christ, like chickens under the hen's
   wings; but the other fear undervalueth the conquest of Christ, as if
   there were no hope for us in our God, and no hope for us in our
   Saviour.

   [4.] It presseth us to praise, honour, and obey him. Conquerors merit
   of their country; usually some trophy and statue is erected to their
   memorial. Oh, what honour do you devise for Christ, now he hath
   conquered for you, now he hath recovered a church, and it may be your
   souls, out of the hands of death, and hell, and Satan, and defended you
   against all the malice of the world! When our knees bow to Christ, our
   mouths must confess him, Phil. ii. 10, 11. Fall down like the elders
   before the Lamb, with the harps of God in your hands, Rev. v. 9, and
   give him honour, and blessing, and praise. David, when he had rest from
   his enemies, he thinketh of building God a temple, 2 Sam. vii. 2. God
   hath given you rest, think of a trophy for God. Honour him in your
   expressions, affections, and conversations. Serve him now he hath set
   you free; you are his by right of conquest: pass over into his power
   and love as Christ's, Rom. vii. 14. The apostle speaketh of himself in
   his natural condition, I am carnal, sold under sin.' He alludeth to a
   custom among the Romans, who, when captives and prisoners were taken in
   war, they were wont to sell them to one another, as captives, under a
   spear. Oh, do not live as carnal, and for the uses and advantages of
   sin, as if you were the spoils of sin, but as the spoils of Jesus
   Christ. Oh, be not sold under sin; wholly pass over into his power and
   right, and live to his glory.

   [5.] Set against the enemies with the more courage and resolution. Oh,
   that the joy of the Lord may be your strength, that in all your
   endeavours against sin and Satan you may look up to the victory of
   Christ! It is said, Rom. vii. 24, 25, O wretched man that I am! who
   shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus
   Christ our Lord.' Oh, you are enclasped within the ribs of the body of
   death: how shall I get free? Through Jesus Christ there is hope of
   triumph. Therefore do not fear, but set upon it. You are mistaken, if
   you think the work was so done upon Christ's cross that there remaineth
   nothing for your care and endeavours: Rom. xvi. 20. God will bruise
   Satan,' but it is under your feet; implying there is something that we
   must do. And Ps. cx. 5, The Lord at thy right hand will smite through
   kings in the day of his wrath.' God will smite them through, but it
   will be at thy right hand, which doth imply our endeavours. Christ will
   divide the spoil with the strong, and the violent take heaven by force;
   therefore use all due means. Men cherish a lazy wish, a yawning, drowsy
   prayer; they may read a chapter, and go on in a dead way, perform a
   cold duty, or make a formal discourse, but they do not stir up
   themselves to lay hold upon God. They do not pray, with tears and
   strong cries and supplications, for a share in Christ's conquest. Where
   is the violence of your spirits, the earnestness of desires, the
   fervency of raised affections, vigorous and powerful endeavours? Prov.
   xiii. 4, The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing.' Oh,
   therefore, stir up yourselves. Who would not put forth endeavours when
   they are like to be successful? James iv. 7, Resist the devil, and he
   shall flee from you.' You shall not only repel him, but chase him. Oh,
   buckle to it to the purpose, put on the whole armour of God. Christ's
   death, and Spirit, and prayers aim at this, that he may do it in you;
   for it should never content you, unless it be done in your souls, that
   he may destroy death in you: Col. i. 29, Whereunto I also labour,
   striving according to the working which worketh in me mightily.' Not
   that he did put forth in his own person only.

   [6.] Pray to him that he would show himself Lord and King, that he
   might rule among his enemies. Christ hath taught us to say, Thy kingdom
   come: desire that he would powerfully and with his own arm work
   salvation. Christ's conquest is founded on his prayers and
   intercessions, therefore help on his kingdom. You know where and to
   whom to go, when you see the church small, worldly powers enraged,
   Satan busy. Oh, complain to him, the strong get all the spoils. Urge
   the promises, especially in the latter days, when the kingdoms of the
   world are to become the kingdoms of the Lord and his Christ.

   2. Here is terror to the adversaries of Christ. His reign is your ruin:
   Ps. xciii., The Lord reigneth;' that is as bad a word as David could
   speak to the enemies. Be wise, you that act contrary designs to the
   glory, reign, cause, and servants of Christ. The Red Sea. that yielded
   a passage to the Israelites, proved a grave to the Egyptians. Consider
   seriously whether it be not against Christ. When your ways are
   challenged as opposite to God, look more thoroughly into the nature of
   them.

   I come now to the second part of the text: Because he hath poured out
   his soul unto death: and was numbered with transgressors; and he bare
   the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.' Which is
   called the conflict of Christ explained, and is set out in four
   things:--

   1. His death.

   2. The ignominy of it.

   3. The cause of it.

   4. The noted circumstance in it: He made intercession for the
   transgressors.'

   I shall begin with the first of these: He hath poured out his soul unto
   death.' It doth not only imply the bare death of Christ, simply that he
   died; but he died willingly and freely, gave up his whole self to
   death. So David speaks in the person of Christ, Ps. xxii. 14, I am
   poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint.' There is
   nothing left in the vessel, neither sap nor savour; he freely and
   willingly poured out every drop of his soul, as if he made no account
   of it, so man might enjoy benefit by it. It noteth both the freeness
   and fulness of the sacrifice; it was unto death, and it was poured out.

   Observe, That the Lord Jesus did freely and willingly yield up himself
   to die for our sakes. I handled such a like point on verse the 7th,
   therefore shall be the more sparing and wary in this. For the proof, I
   shall rather evidence that it was so, than why he desired it: Luke xii.
   50, I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till
   it be accomplished!' He thought the time would never come; he hindered
   it not: he did not discontinue resorting to the garden, the place of
   his usual abode and retirement. Judas knew that he often resorted
   thither with his disciples: Mat. xxvi. 53, Thinkest thou that I cannot
   now pray to my Father, and he shall presently send me more than twelve
   legions of angels?' The violence of man did not take his life from him:
   John x. 17, 18, Therefore cloth my Father love me, because I lay down
   my life: no man taketh it from me, I lay it down of myself.' It was not
   an enforced obedience to the will of God, for God did not only give
   Christ, but he gave himself: Gal. i. 4, Who gave himself for our sins;'
   and Eph. v. 2, He loved us, and gave himself for us;' which appeared by
   the cheerful resignation of his soul into the hands of the Father in
   his agonies: Luke xxiii. 46, Father, into thy hands I commend my
   Spirit.' It is said, He cried with a loud voice,' which noteth his
   confidence and willingness.

   Use 1. It serveth to commend the love of Christ, in that he gave
   himself: He poured out his soul,' and that to the death.' There are
   three things to be noted:--

   1. The gift.

   2. The manner of giving.

   3. The intent.

   1. The gift. We read of great gifts in the scripture: Zaccheus, when
   salvation was come to his house, Luke xix. 8, says, Half my goods I
   give to the poor.' And Herod proffered half his kingdom to his niece
   when she pleased him, Mark vi. 23. God in the creation gave all the
   creatures to man; and the devil says to Christ, Mat. iv. 9, All these
   will I give thee.' Ay! but here Christ giveth himself, poureth out his
   own soul, and with himself everything that maketh for the delighting
   and contenting of the spirit. Oh, it is better than a thousand worlds!
   At our creation God gave us but the creatures, but here God giveth
   himself.

   2. The manner; He poured out his soul;' which noteth a copious and
   bounteous effusion of his blood for the creatures' good. Nihil in hoc
   Christo est nisi profusa liberalitas misericordiae, et remissionis
   peccatorum, said Luther--I see nothing in this Christ but a prodigality
   of love; if guilty of anything, it was of too much freeness: He poured
   out his soul.' Oh, when you are at the Lord's Supper, and see the wine
   poured out, remember the death of Christ set out by this notion, He
   poured out his soul unto death;' see how freely Christ emptied his
   veins. In the garden he did sweat drops of blood; every pore in his
   body became an eye, and it wept blood for your sakes.

   3. The end and intent, why he would pour out himself like water. It was
   to die for you: He poured out his soul to death.' Simeon suffered
   himself to be bound for his brethren, Gen. xlii. 24. Lot offered his
   daughter, and the man in Judges prostitutes his daughter; and the
   Levite, Judges xix. 23, 24, his concubine to the lusts of the men of
   Gibeah; but saith Christ, Greater love hath no man than this, that a
   man lay down his life for his friend.' That is man's heroic honour, and
   it may be we may find two or three rare instances in history. But Jesus
   Christ laid down his life for enemies, for dead dogs,' as David calleth
   himself. Such as we are he poured out his soul for, even to death. Oh,
   enlarge your thoughts on these particulars.

   Use 2. It yieldeth useful inferences and enforcements to duty.

   1. To humbled sinners. Take Christ as freely as he offereth himself to
   you: He poured out his soul, and you will not come to him, you will not
   receive him. Oh, come and pour out yourselves into the bosom of Christ;
   he hath poured out his soul to death for you. You that complain as the
   church, Lam. ii. 11, My liver is poured out,' there is much faintness
   and fears. The liver is the seat of blood; it is made there, and
   dispersed from thence into all the veins: your liver is only poured
   out, but Christ's soul is so. Consider, all the persons in the blessed
   Trinity are willing, and are not you? The Father, John iii. 16, He gave
   his only-begotten Son.' And Christ gave himself, Gal. i. 4. And the
   Spirit is willing, he is grieved at your refusal: I would have gathered
   you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not.'
   He wooeth and beseecheth you, and pleadeth for your entertainment of
   Jesus Christ. Oh, open to him, and be as willing to believe as Christ
   was to die: Ps. cxlii. 2, I poured out my complaint to him, I showed
   before him my trouble.' Pour out your souls in faith and prayer, as
   Christ poured out his soul on the cross.

   2. To stubborn sinners, to press them to come out of their sins upon
   this ground--Jesus Christ poured out his soul unto death. Christ parted
   with his heart's blood, and will not you part with your sinful
   delights? Shall we love our sins better than Christ loved his own soul?
   He laid down his life, and will not you lay down your lusts? Nay, what
   horrible unthankfulness is this? Christ poured out his soul to death,
   and we pour out our souls in the ways of death. In the 11th verse of
   Jude's epistle we read, that they ran greedily after the error of
   Balaam.' In the original it is, They poured out in the error of
   Balaam;' not as water out of a vessel, drop by drop; but as water out
   of a bucket, in abundance. Hearts set upon the world, set upon lusts
   and pleasures, are expressed by giving themselves to work wickedness.
   Oh, should not you give up yourselves to Jesus Christ, when he gave out
   himself for you? That is an ill requital, to let loose the reins to
   your vile affections, and to pour out yourselves in sins without
   restraint.

   3. To the people of God. Christ poured out his soul to death, freely
   and fully offered himself for your sakes: it presseth you to an
   imitation in your duties and respects towards God and men. Pour out
   your souls, discharge them fully and freely; they are both expressed by
   pouring out the soul. In your duty to God: So Hannah is said, 1 Sam. i.
   16, to pour out her soul before the Lord;' to come freely, and draw out
   her affections and desires before God. And so for duties to man: Isa.
   lviii. 10, If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
   afflicted soul, then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy
   darkness be as noonday.' Do both freely.

   [1.] Your duties and respect to God. Oh, come and pour out your whole
   souls; the willingness of your services is the commendation of them:
   Call the Sabbath a delight,' Isa. lviii. 13; and 1 Chron. xxviii. 9,
   Thou shalt serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind;' and make
   prayer your joy and pleasure, your comfort and your solace: Isa. ii. 3,
   Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of
   the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways.' Let the meditation of
   God be sweet to you: Ps. civ. 34, And I will be glad in the Lord.' See
   that the thoughts of God are pleasing to you. But now, on the contrary,
   when the Sabbath is a burden, prayer a task, and you cannot wait upon
   the Lord one hour in hearing or holy meditation; when the commandments
   are grievous, meditation irksome, holy company and conference a prison;
   oh! then, I say, consider the freeness of Jesus Christ in pouring out
   his blood for you, and you will find the advantage of pouring out your
   hearts before God.

   [2.] In your duties and respects to men. In all offices of love and
   service, do it willingly; for such was the love of the Lord Jesus to
   you: 1 Peter v. 2, Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the
   oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly;' especially if it
   be to instruct and teach them, and to take pains with them about the
   good of their souls: Phil. iii. 1, To write the same things to you, to
   me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.' He often speaks how
   little good was done, but it was not grievous to him to try again.
   Labour to put off the sluggishness of your spirits with this
   consideration--Jesus Christ died freely for souls to relieve them, and
   shall not I be at some pains to persuade them to accept of him? Forced
   kindness loseth its acceptance; God and man prize the willing mind
   best. The will honoureth God more than the deed; for it is not our act
   any further than it is done willingly: 2 Cor. viii. 12, If there be
   first a willing mind, it is accepted, according to that a man hath, and
   not according to what he hath not.' The widow's mite was noted; the
   unjust judge did his duty by constraint; and in so doing we do not only
   relieve others, but ourselves.

   Use 3. To press us to act proportionably to the act of Christ. He
   yielded up his whole self, and did it with his whole heart; so let your
   abounding be in believing, and your gratitude in yielding up yourselves
   with your whole heart.

   I come now to the second circumstance, the ignominy of Christ's death:
   He was numbered with transgressors.' It is to be understood of God or
   man. It is true before God, God looking upon him under our guilt; but
   it is most properly true in regard of men, who counted him a sinner and
   a transgressor, and so delivered him to the Gentiles: John xviii. 30,
   If he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him to thee.'
   But more especially this prophecy is said to be fulfilled in two places
   of scripture: as Mark xv. 27, 28, And with him they crucified two
   thieves, one on his right hand, and the other on his left. And the
   scripture was fulfilled, which saith. And he was numbered with the
   transgressors.' That is then eminently fulfilled; for it was also at
   other times, but then especially, being placed in the middle, not only
   as a companion of thieves, but as their prince and chieftain. So Luke
   xxii. 37, For I say unto you, that this that is written must be
   accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for
   the things concerning me have an end.' There he speaketh as if the
   intent of this prophecy was more general. I told you of all things
   necessary; for I and you must be accounted wicked persons; it must be
   so, for it is foretold. You see the sense; now for the points.

   Observe, that the Lord Jesus Christ was reckoned among transgressors,
   especially in his death and sufferings.

   For proof of the point, which is general, let me suggest to you that he
   was so reputed by men; by wicked men, godly men, and by God himself.

   1. By wicked men he was counted a glutton and a wine-bibber, Mat. xi.
   19; and John viii. 48, Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil.' Nay,
   they accounted him the prince of devils, but this was chiefly at his
   death. The high priest charged him with no less than blasphemy: Mat.
   xxvi. 65, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of
   witnesses?' False witnesses were suborned to accuse him of sedition
   against his country, as if he would destroy the temple, and as if he
   were a seducer and perverter of the people; of disloyalty to Caesar, as
   if he went about to make himself king, John xviii. 36. They preferred
   Barabbas, a murderer, before him. See these things in the Evangelists.

   2. By godly men: Luke xxiv. 21, We trusted that it had been he who
   should have redeemed Israel.' In their distrustful thoughts the
   disciples began to doubt of him, and so looked upon him as an imposter.

   3. By God himself. Christ having taken our sins upon him, was dealt
   with as a transgressor: 1 Peter iv. 1, For he that hath suffered in the
   flesh, hath ceased from sin;' and Heb. ix. 28, He shall appear the
   second time without sin unto salvation.' In his first coming he was not
   without sin by imputation.

   Well, but for the reason why God would suffer Christ thus to be
   numbered with transgressors. I shall not much trouble you with the
   allegories of the ancients, recorded by Aquinas, why Christ was
   crucified between two thieves, and so reckoned as one of them, as the
   chief of them, to typify that distinction that shall be made at the day
   of judgment, some being put on the right hand of Christ, and some on
   the left. The thief on the right hand was received into paradise, so
   Reo [14] and Austin. Christ's cross, made his tribunal in his
   sufferings, and a type of his second glorious coming, and he as a judge
   placed between two others, who are of less avail, implied, as Hilary
   would have it, that though all did not know the cross and sufferings of
   Christ, yet some should be placed on the right hand and some on the
   left. So Beza thought that the thief on the left side signified those
   that should endure strictness and hardships in Christianity for the
   praise of men; others for the praise of God, as the thief on the right
   side. But these are all but flashes of wit. The reasons of the point
   are:--

   1. That these might be sensible evidences of those sins of ours that
   Christ bore in his body, and had taken upon himself. This reason is in
   the text, He was numbered among transgressors, for he bare the sins of
   many.' God would give believers this evidence and testimony that he was
   a transgressor; that you may know all the load of the blasphemies and
   rebellions laid upon Christ, God gave a taste of it in these
   imputations--a devil, a blasphemer. God made special use of their
   malice to direct our thoughts to the guilt transacted on Christ.

   2. Because Christ was to make satisfaction by suffering all that we
   were to suffer. We are cursed, therefore Christ was made a curse, Gal.
   iii. 13. We were to endure the wrath of God, therefore he bore our
   griefs, Isa. liii. 4. We are to blame, and deserve shame, therefore he
   would undergo that, and suffer in his credit and honour, Our reproach
   is taken away, because Christ would take it upon himself: he was the
   reproach of men,' Ps. xxii. 6. We were sinners, and therefore Christ is
   called a murderer, a thief, a blasphemer, one that had a devil. This
   was a circumstance that commended the greatness of the satisfaction.
   What greater satisfaction could we expect or desire than that Christ,
   who is holiness itself, should not only suffer, but suffer under
   ignominies--that innocency itself should suffer as a malefactor? This
   made the sufferings of Christ exceeding great and valuable. Christ
   would lay aside all his glory, pleasure, and honour, and sacrifice
   everything for the good of the creature. You have the life of God, and
   the honour of God, and all. There is nothing that God prizeth so much
   as his honour, and Christ would suffer that God's honour might not be
   obscured by these imputations, but repaired.

   Use 1. Is information. It informeth us of the great love of Christ; he
   not only poured out his soul to death, but to an accursed death.
   Suppose it had been merely for the cause of salvation, would it then
   have yielded more comfort? No; but he suffered as a malefactor, a
   thief, worse than a murderer. An ingenious man valueth his good name
   above all enjoyments. It stood Christ in much stead to have his
   innocency cleared, that the world might know that he did not die for
   his own sins, but the just for the unjust. And yet, though it is true
   there were evident demonstrations of his innocency out of Pilate's
   mouth, yet Christ would suffer as a malefactor, so as to suffer every
   thing you were to suffer; he would make his sufferings every way
   valuable. Oh, what a mercy is here!

   2. It informeth us that glory and innocency itself may be beclouded.
   Christ was under aspersions. Do not believe every report of the godly.
   Wicked men would fain paint them out in ill colours; but we must drink
   of the same cup with Christ. What foul things were charged upon the
   primitive Christians, that they were obscene and turbulent in their
   practices! Always suspect those aspersions that are cast upon religious
   eminency.

   3. It informeth us how unlike Christ the men of the world are. Christ
   is innocent, but counted a transgressor; they are transgressors, yet
   would fain be accounted innocent. Honour me before the people,' saith
   Saul, 1 Sam. xv. 30. They are more careful of their credit than their
   conscience; they would not be accounted sinners, and yet do not fear to
   be so. They are all for man's judgment, though that is nothing to a
   gracious heart. Christ was innocent, however he might suffer under
   misrepresentations. You are most like him when you look to your
   conscience, and trust God for your credit.

   Use 2. Is consolation to you. Here is comfort, for the main: Christ was
   counted a sinner for your sakes; that must needs be a great
   satisfaction, seeing Christ has suffered his own glory to be obscured
   and eclipsed. You are a great sinner, but urge the sufficiency of his
   satisfaction. You have deserved great blame; consider God hath laid it
   upon Christ. Satan accuseth of foul miscarriages, and you must
   certainly cry out Guilty. He cannot commence a greater accusation
   against you than his instruments did against Jesus Christ. They accuse
   him of sedition, theft, heresy, blasphemy--crimes that run highest
   against God and men. Oh, what abundant consolation is there, that
   Christ hath borne the blame, and hath made a great satisfaction! As
   high accusations were commenced against Christ as can be against you.

   2. Here is comfort in this. When you are under undiscerned [15]
   reproaches, comfort yourselves thus: This was the lot of Christ. I do
   not mean merely under the same reproaches, but sufferings not deserved,
   for Christ's sake. God knew his Son in the midst of the two thieves,
   and the martyrs in the common goal, and Daniel in the lions' den, and
   the lily among thorns. The thieves were crucified with him, yet they
   justly; but if you do not suffer as an evil-doer, take comfort though
   you be crucified between thieves, yoked with ill companions; Christ was
   numbered among transgressors. It was an old trick to bring an odium
   upon the truth, to put it upon ill company. Though you be bound up in
   ill bundles, yet God will know his jewels.

   I come now to the third circumstance, that which is called the conflict
   of Christ, and that is the cause both of his death and the ignominy of
   it: He bare the sins of many.' This is a circumstance very often
   repeated in this prophecy, and often mentioned by the prophet in this
   chapter; so that I need dwell the less on it now. And it is so often
   mentioned, because this is the great argument that maketh the glory and
   innocency of Christ to be clear in our thoughts, notwithstanding the
   scandal of the greatness of his sufferings from the repetition. By the
   way observe:--

   That when we remember, consider, or make mention of the sufferings of
   Christ, we should also reflect upon the cause of it, viz., the bearing
   of our sins and iniquities. This is what the prophet doth frequently
   here, not only once or twice, but again and again, to show you that
   other reflections upon the sufferings of Christ were not proper and
   useful.

   The reasons are:--

   1. Because this is most for the glory and honour of Christ.

   2. For the good and benefit of the creature.

   1. For Christ's glory. We are apt to judge men mean under sufferings
   and disgrace. The prophet bringeth in the Jews' saying here, We did
   esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted,' Isa. liii. 4.
   Otherwise men would be apt to think something alien and unbecoming
   Christ, especially when there were such formal accusations commenced
   against him. But alas! consider they were not occasioned by any fault
   of his, either against God's or man's interest. Much was pretended, but
   nothing proved; nothing to make him obnoxious to God's justice or man's
   judgment. They talked of destroying the temple, of rising against
   Caesar; but these were but surmises and malicious jealousies. The
   person of Christ and the glory of Christ is most clear in your
   thoughts, when you perceive that on his part there was nothing to
   occasion his death and sufferings.

   2. For the good of the creature. It mindeth us of our comfort and duty.

   [1.] Our comfort. When we consider his sufferings under such a notion,
   we cannot but remember there is our expiation, there is a satisfaction
   for our sins. God hath found a ransom: He died, the just for the
   unjust,' 1 Peter iii. 18. It maketh you mindful of the price and
   ransom. The price was paid for you: Rom. v. 8, Herein God commended his
   love, that when we were sinners, Christ died for us.' Here is a just
   Christ, that died for poor sinners: remember it for your comfort,
   mention it for your comfort; here is your expiation and satisfaction.

   [2.] It mindeth us of our duty. When we consider these sufferings were
   for our sins, it mindeth us of our debt of obedience, wherein we stand
   engaged to his love and liberality; and it giveth us a sense of his
   love, and so in thankfulness engageth us to obedience. What sufferings
   are too hard, what duty too great, to go through with for one that hath
   done so much for us?

   Use. By this you may know what reflections upon the death and
   sufferings of Christ are good and proper; not such only as work a fond
   compassion, for we are naturally apt to pity those in misery; not
   foolish anger against the Jews, not a little vain delight--these are
   effects when you look upon it as a mere story; but the glorifying of
   Christ and humbling of ourselves, increase of faith, comfortable
   persuasions and excitations to duty and praise--these show you consider
   it rightly. I would but hint these things, because they are obvious.

   But to come to the sense of the phrase, And he bare the sins of many.'
   I shall content myself with the assertion of the text, and show you
   what it implieth. He bare the sin importeth two things:--

   1. The susception of our guilt: he bare it.

   2. The sustaining of our punishment. Both were upon Christ as a heavy
   burden, our guilt and our punishment He was made sin, and was under
   wrath. In one respect sin is made to be laid upon him by God in ver. 6,
   The Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all;' and in the other
   he is said to bear our sins in his body on the tree,' 1 Peter ii. 24,
   which noteth the enduring of the punishment of them. Both yield a great
   deal of comfort to those that have interest in Christ: he bare their
   guilt, and he bare their punishment. It is comfort in three cases:--

   [1.] When their hearts are ready to sink within them under the
   multitude and greatness of their provocations: Ps. xxxviii. 4, Mine
   iniquities are gone over my head, as an heavy burden they are too heavy
   for me.' Oh, it is heavy and sad with that soul that is compassed about
   with innumerable evils! This will cause heart-failing and quaking when
   our sins, our pride, and haughtiness, are set in order before us. Here
   conscience accuseth for sins of the highest aggravation, slighting of
   means, abuse of mercies, wantoning in all manner of provocations,
   serving divers lusts and pleasures, cursed worldliness, carelessness of
   the great salvation, neglect of our family duties, ill example, gross
   omissions, seldom praying, or, when it is done, in a drowsy, dead way,
   little discussion with your hearts and ways. When these things are
   mustered up against us, the soul is bowed down under its own fears, and
   cannot look up, nor scarce groan out a sigh for mercy. Oh, consider you
   are not to bear your sins, but Jesus Christ; see all this load
   transacted upon the back of Jesus Christ: Mat. xi. 28, Come unto me,
   all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' By
   putting the burden upon his own back, he bare our sins.

   But you will say, I have sinned, but God must have satisfaction; the
   guilt and punishment must be borne by somebody.

   Oh, consider it is borne by Jesus Christ. As Aaron was to bear the
   iniquity of the holy things of the children of Israel, Exod. xxviii.
   38, so Christ will bear the sins of your duties. His soul was heavy
   unto death, Mat. xxvi. 38. A little before the showers there is a
   gloominess and sad blackness; so there was upon Christ's spirit a
   little before the showers of wrath were poured out upon him. To lighten
   you, Christ's own soul is heavy and exceeding sorrowful; he bare your
   sins. Thus, in the burden of guilt, it is a lightening of the eyes and
   a relieving of your bondage.

   [2.] When you are oppressed with the burden of punishment, fears of
   death and hell. We are naturally subject to these things: Heb. ii. 15,
   Who all their lifetime were subject to bondage through fear of death.'
   Conscience, that convinceth of sin, assureth of judgment: Rom. i. 32,
   Who knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are
   worthy of death.' Our hearts and our own despairing thoughts are upon
   us; then we smell the brimstone and the stench of the pit that cometh
   up into our nostrils. Oh, what shall we do, for these everlasting
   burnings will consume us? Consider, the satisfaction will not be
   required of you; He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.'
   Christ, that took your sin, bare your punishment; even Jesus who hath
   delivered us from wrath to come,' 1 Thes. i. 10.

   [3.] In the case of afflictions. Providence is against us; and then
   afflictions without raise troubles and discontents within. We think God
   is against us, and all is ordered by way of satisfaction to divine
   vengeance; all is wormwood and gall, and the terrors of the Lord
   possess our spirits. Oh, but hold up the head, and consider nothing is
   done to a believer by way of punishment and satisfaction of divine
   vengeance: all that was required of Jesus Christ; he bore that in his
   body upon the tree. We are not to bear our own sins. Natural men do
   think that all their misery is formally penal, and ordered by way of
   punishment, the sting of death, and all afflictions. But yours are not
   punishments; that is the wormwood and gall of afflictions. The idol
   priests were to bear their own iniquities, Ezek. xliv. 10. But Christ
   hath taken the sins of his people upon himself. You may have the same
   afflictions with wicked men, or that you had before conversion; but
   their habit and use is changed to you. Either they are chastisements or
   corrections, whose use is to instruct or humble.

   To instruct them in their duty: Their ears are opened to discipline,'
   Job xxxvi. 10; and Christ learned obedience by the things he suffered.'
   Heb. v. 8.

   To show us the vanity of the creature: Ps. xxxix. 11, When thou with
   rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to
   consume away like a moth. Surely every man is vanity.' Then they see it
   to humble them, Job xxxvi. 8; and if they be bound in fetters, and
   holden in cords of affliction, it is to show them they have been proud.
   Now, it is a great mercy when we can look upon afflictions under this
   notion. It is a great mercy to have our afflictions sanctified: Ps.
   xciv. 12, Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest
   out of thy law.' Want maketh the prodigal child think of returning,
   Luke xv. And for prevention, they are an antidote to keep off poison.
   It would have been worse with me if it had not been so: Ps. cxix. 71,
   It is good for me that I have been afflicted.' It is a corrosive, like
   Paul's messenger of Satan, to cure his pride, 2 Cor. xii. 7; and to
   mind them of duty: Hosea v. 15, I will go and return to my place, till
   they acknowledge their offences and seek my face; in their afflictions
   they will seek me early.' And for the exercise of graces, and to
   conform them to their head, as patience, obedience, and faith; bruised
   spices are the more fragrant. So that in all these respects, and many
   other such like, we may take comfort in the saddest things that befall
   us: Ps. xxiii. 4, Thy rod and thy staff doth comfort me.' We do not
   fear our iniquities when we bear these things.

   It followeth in the text, He bare the sins of many;' that is, of the
   elect, not of all without exception. The same was in the former verse,
   For he shall bear their iniquities.' And so in other places: Rom. v.
   19, As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
   obedience of one shall many be made righteous.' So in the 15th verse,
   The gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded to
   many.'

   Observe, that the merit of Christ's death was not extended to all. He
   bare the sins of many.

   I shall propose these arguments:--

   1. Christ died for no more than are elected.

   2. The death of Christ is usually restrained in scripture to such a
   number and such a company that shall be saved.

   3. Christ must needs save all that he intended to save.

   4. All those to whom Christ intended the merit of his sufferings, they
   shall have it applied to them.

   5. Because Christ's special love was only to few.

   6. Because Christ doth not pray for all, and therefore he did not die
   for all.

   7. Christ's offices are of equal extent; those that have Christ have
   whole Christ.

   Use 1. If Christ did not intend the merit of his sufferings to all, and
   bore only the sins of many, it standeth us upon to see that we be of
   the number of those for whom Christ died. I shall use a motive or two
   to you.

   1. The misery of those that bear their own sins. In what a sad case are
   you if you should bear the heavy and insupportable load of your own
   sins! Consider and look about you for the Lord's sake, and see if you
   be some of Christ's royal priesthood, and a chosen generation. You may
   know it by the effects of Christ in the hearts of the faithful, in your
   own sense and experiences, in the communications of the word, and how
   it will be with you hereafter.

   [1.] By what Christ felt when he took our sins from us. Job saith, Job
   vi. 4, The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison thereof
   drinketh up my spirit; the terrors of God do set themselves in array
   against me.' Christ lost the comfortable apprehensions of God's favour.
   Wherever there is sin, there will be a separation. My God, my God, why
   hast thou forsaken me?' His soul was exceeding sorrowful, felt strange
   agonies and passions, which are the more remarkable because of the
   eminency of the person; had these things been found in us, it had not
   been so notable. Weak spirits are soon dismayed and terrified at
   anything that hath but a dreadful appearance. Glover, the martyr, was
   so affected with the sense of some backsliding, that for some years he
   lost the use and pleasure of his senses. But for Christ to be sad,
   Christ in agonies, Christ to sweat drops of blood, it maketh it the
   more noted.

   [2.] By what effects it hath upon the saints. When the little finger of
   God hath been upon them, oh! how have they roared through their own
   folly all the day long! Ps. xl. 12, Mine iniquities have taken hold
   upon me, therefore my heart faileth.' All life and spirit is gone when
   the soul laboureth under the guilt of one sin. All the racks in the
   world are nothing to the rack of conscience: Luke xxiii. 31, For if
   they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done to the dry?'

   [3.] Consider your sense and experience. When conscience hath been a
   little opened, oh! what horrors and disquiets have they felt, and how
   sore a bondage has there been upon men, good or bad! Sometimes God
   giveth his own people a taste what it is to bear their own sins,
   especially under some great judgment or fears of death. A man can
   divert other griefs: Prov. xviii. 14, The spirit of a man will sustain
   his infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can bear?' Oh, the
   intolerableness of a conscience wounded with sin! Do not your joints
   smite one another for fear when you see the handwriting against you? A
   man hath the best apprehension of such things in such a case. And then,
   oh! for thousands of rams and ten thousand rivers of oil, Micah vi. 7.
   Then ten thousand worlds would he give to set his soul free. What would
   Spira have done when under terrors? So Mr Democke, under what desertion
   was he for eating with too much delight and inconsiderate greediness,
   who, as Mr Bolton witnesseth, crieth out, Oh, the hell of my
   conscience! So for ungodly men. Cain crieth out, Gen. iv. 13, My
   punishment is greater than I can bear,' desperately murmuring against
   justice. And Judas hanged himself, thinking thereby to be rid of the
   terrors of his conscience. Even in the experiences of this life, God
   showeth what it is to bear sin.

   [4.] Consider the life to come, and the threatenings of the word
   concerning those that die in their sins and bear their own
   transgressions. Oh, how sad will it be to be haled by devils, and added
   to the rest of the spirits now in prison, and reserved in chains of
   darkness unto the judgment of the great day! When sins, that now are
   like sleepy lions, shall arise enraged and tear our souls, and there be
   none to deliver, as Ps. l. 22. Oh, this is the portion of them that
   bear their own burden and their own transgression!

   2. The happiness of those whose sins are borne by Christ. No guilt can
   be charged upon them, no punishment can be laid upon them, no sins, no
   guilt shall be laid upon them; the scapegoat hath carried them away
   into a land of darkness: Jer. l. 20, In those days, and in that time,
   saith the Lord, the iniquities of Israel shall be sought for, and there
   shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found.' So
   Ps. ciii. 12, As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he
   removed our transgressions from us.' They are quite out of sight; our
   iniquities are not where we are. No punishment is to be laid upon us;
   God will not exact the debt twice, of us and Christ too. Something
   corrective may be done to us, but nothing penal; justice is satisfied,
   anger appeased, the sting of afflictions is plucked out, and all
   serveth to make us the more meet for glory. It were but a poor pardon
   if God should retain the punishment. The rod comforteth.

   Let these things then persuade you to consider whether you are of the
   number of those whose sins Christ bare in his body.

   But you will say, How shall we know whether we be of that number?

   I answer in these propositions:--

   1. Your first care must not be to look to God's election. Hidden things
   belong to God; man must regard duty: Deut. xxix. 29, The secret things
   belong to the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong
   to us and to our children for ever.' We are overwise when we would pry
   into the secrets of heaven. God's secret will hath relation to his own
   actions, his revealed will to ours. We must not look to what he will
   do, but what he will have us do.

   2. Our duty is to believe till the matter be cleared to us. Beg faith,
   or act faith. There is a double act: To look upon Christ as bearing the
   sins of the world, and to see a full satisfaction in Christ, and so at
   least a possibility for our souls being saved: John i. 29, Behold the
   Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.' See him bearing
   sins upon the cross. Men bear their own sins when they cannot look up:
   Ps. xl. 12, Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not
   able to look up.' Oh, be not always poring upon sin; a wound always
   rubbed cannot be cured. See a satisfaction made by Christ, and so you
   may have comfort in Christ. Secondly, To present Christ to the Father
   in your own behalf; show him your surety, lay your hands upon the head
   of the sacrifice before the Lord: when the debt is satisfied, God
   looketh that you should come to him for an acquittance. Oh, desire it
   may be sealed up to your souls; say, Lord, was not thy justice
   satisfied in Christ? Do not make particular exceptions where God makes
   none. This is that God hath required of thee, to believe and fetch out
   your pardon. Oh, there hangeth a weight of guilt upon you, and he
   invited the heavy laden to come to him for ease and rest. Thus doing,
   you may haply come to know and to determine that you are of the number.

   3. This being done, God is many times pleased to clear it up fully to
   some of his people, that their names were some of those that were given
   to Christ, whose sins he was to bear and expiate; thy name is written
   upon the breast of thy High Priest, and thy sins upon his back. Those
   that lie in the bosom of Christ, they have the Spirit of Christ, that
   revealeth the secrets of heaven to them, the purposes and decrees of
   love; the sealed fountain is broke open, and joys flow in upon their
   spirits. And there are dispositions by which the soul concludeth her
   interest in Christ. I shall name two. They are--

   [1.] A humble and thankful acknowledgment in the sense] of so great a
   privilege; the soul admireth the mercy, and wondereth that he should
   look after such poor worms as we are, that he should give Christ a
   charge concerning us, and trust Christ with the care and good of their
   souls, the expiation of their sins. I say, the sense of all this maketh
   them humble and thankful: 1 Peter ii. 9, That ye should show forth the
   praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous
   light.'

   [2.] There will be answerable effects to such a privilege in heart and
   life: 1 Peter ii. 24, Who his own self bare our sins in his own body
   upon the tree, that we, being dead to sin, should live unto
   righteousness.' Corruptions are more mortified, and graces more
   quickened. If Christ bare our sins, we shall feel his Spirit; he will
   exchange with us. He felt the wrath of God, and we feel the joys of his
   Spirit. He took our sins, and he will not leave till he hath
   communicated to us his grace and glory.

   And he made intercession for the transgressors.

   These words are the fourth considerable particular in Christ's
   conflict, a noted circumstance either at or upon his death. Some make
   them to be of a more private and restrained sense; others, of a more
   public and general. I shall exclude neither, for they are one
   subordinate to the other. Those that look upon them as words of a
   private and particular concernment, make them to relate to that prayer
   of Christ on the cross, Luke xxiii. 34, Father, forgive them, for they
   know not what they do;' a circumstance that extremely commendeth the
   love and patience of Christ, when, in the midst of the extremity of his
   sufferings, he doth not think of revenge and retaliation, but of mercy,
   and doing his persecutors good. Others look upon them as if the prophet
   did aim at some greater matter, namely, as implying the whole mediation
   and intercession of Christ, which as a high priest he presenteth to the
   Father, and by virtue of it pleadeth to him in our behalf. I shall
   exclude neither of these senses; for the former is but a part and
   pledge of this, it is a discovery of those bowels that are in Christ to
   poor sinners.

   From the former observe, that Christ prayed for his persecutors. Our
   translation inclineth to this sense, as reading in the praeter tense:
   He made intercession for the transgressors;' whereas the original will
   bear, He shall make intercession for the transgressors,' as referring
   it to some particular men, not transgressors indefinitely. The point
   being historical, the prophecy of the text and the testimony of Luke is
   confirmation sufficient. I shall inquire under what notion and
   consideration he made this prayer, and so apply it.

   Christ in this and such like actions is to be considered in a double
   regard:--

   1. As a holy, godly man; so he was to fulfil all righteousness.

   2. As a mediator and public person, that was to be our High Priest, to
   satisfy and intercede.

   In the first sense the scripture proposeth Christ as an example; in the
   second, as an object of our faith. His actions are partly for
   satisfaction, so his mediatory actions; and partly for our imitation,
   as an exemplary pattern. Which distinction and several references not
   being weighed, we lose much comfort and instruction which otherwise we
   might find. You shall see these actions of Christ in scripture are
   joined both together in one place: 1 Peter ii. 21, Because Christ also
   suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
   steps.' In the former clause he is to be looked upon and considered as
   Mediator; in the other as an eminent, holy, and godly man, as a
   pattern. Both these two must be carefully distinguished, as in all
   other matters of this nature, so especially in the prayers of Christ;
   as in that prayer, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
   me,' Mat. xxvi. 39. That prayer was uttered by Christ as a private,
   godly man, for as Mediator he did not desire it. As a private godly
   man, he was to have such natural abhorrences of evil as we have, and to
   refer himself to the will of God. And this distinction is the rather to
   be marked, because Christ's prayers as a godly man, his private
   prayers, were only a testimony and instance of duty, and so might not
   be granted. But as to his mediatory prayers, he was heard always, John
   xi. 42; for these were of equal merit with his sufferings, whose fruit
   and intent could not be frustrated and disannulled.

   To apply this to the matter in hand: Was this prayer of Christ for the
   persecutors uttered as the private prayer of a godly man in obedience
   to the law, or as Mediator of the covenant?

   I answer--You must consider it both ways:--

   1. As of a private man, a man subject to the law, and that would fulfil
   all righteousness, and would exemplify his own doctrine: Mat. v. 44,
   But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
   good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you
   and persecute you.' Christ would teach us by his practice, as well as
   by his precept, to pray for enemies. For knowing what was in man,' John
   ii. 25, that is, the state of men's hearts, whether they would be saved
   or no, and knowing some of these would not be saved, he could not pray
   for them as Mediator, but as a private man; his prayers were
   conditional, that God would forgive them, in case they did repent and
   believe. As when we pray God to bless a wicked man, and give him
   eternal life, we imply by giving him faith and repentance; so did
   Christ as a testimony of duty and obedience, and so far as he prayed
   for them he was heard; and therefore to some of the persecutors they
   were but as the prayers of a private godly man, with a condition.

   2. The prayers of a mediator, and so Christ absolutely prayed that God
   would look upon them in mercy; and so he did, upon all those that did
   it in ignorance, for they enjoyed the fruit of these prayers. That
   intercession was the cause of the conversion of the three thou sand;
   for to those Peter speaketh, Acts ii. 23, Ye have taken, and by wicked
   hands have crucified and slain;' and from the 37th verse downward, you
   shall see their conversion described, ver. 41, There were three
   thousand souls added to the church;' they began to feel the effect of
   Christ's prayer. So Acts iii. 17, And now, brethren, I wot that through
   ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.' He goeth by that
   argument that Christ useth in his prayers: the Mediator prayed for the
   pardon of those that did it in their ignorance. So that you see
   Christ's prayers were partly as the prayers of a mediator, and partly
   as of a private person. In the one there is something propounded to our
   imitation; in the other, to our comfort and faith.

   First, For our imitation. Consider this act as the duty of a glorious
   saint who is gone before us. Christ is a rare and eminent instance of
   meekness, and patience, and love, nay, even love to his enemies. Oh
   that we could transcribe this copy, that such instances of obedience
   might be found in our hearts and ways! We are poor, passionate spirits,
   that are ready to lose our lives with our sting; like fine glasses,
   broken as soon as touched. We take up every discontent, and aggravate
   it, being ready to revenge the wrongs that are done to us, and cannot
   put up the least injuries and affronts without storming and
   indignation. Angry spirits will have satisfaction. We think provocation
   an excuse for passion. The son of an Israelitish woman and an
   Israelitish man strove in the camp, and the son blasphemed the name of
   the Lord, for which he was stoned to death, Lev. xxiv. 10-14. Christ
   was provoked, but he was not passionate, but prayed for his
   persecutors.

   We learn three things in this instance, which we cannot reflect upon
   without the shame of our own faces. This mirror will kill like the
   basilisk when we look on it.

   1. Not to retaliate, hate, curse, revile, and pursue injuries with in
   juries. We cannot come to this: 1 Peter ii. 23, Who when he was
   reviled, reviled not again.' It is otherwise with us; rather than take
   an example from Christ, we take it from our enemies, do as they do to
   us. Why should a man imitate that which he judgeth evil in others?
   Revenge and injury differ but in order; the one is first, the other
   second. Revenge is a sweet evil; nothing more pleasing to nature, and
   more contrary to grace. Nothing more pleasing to nature: Patience, in
   the eye of nature, is a kind of weakness and servility. Men will plead
   for this; but Solomon saith, Prov. xxiv. 29, Say not, I will do so to
   him as he hath done to me.' Aristotle saith, it is as reprovable to
   love an enemy as to hate a friend; and he saith, it argueth a servile,
   slow wit, and a disingenious spirit. In direct opposition to which
   Solomon saith, Prov. xix. 11, The discretion of a man deferreth his
   anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.' It is a man's
   honour; it is not a servile, but a Christian and free spirit. And it is
   the most contrary to grace; for giving is many times made the condition
   of the promises, and the measure of our expectations from God: Forgive
   as we forgive.' It is much, even a meritorious act in our thoughts, if
   we do but pass by an offence.

   2. We learn to do good, and seek the good of others, to feed and supply
   a hungry, thirsty enemy: Prov. xxv. 21, If thine enemy be hungry, give
   him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink.' David
   saith, Ps. xxxv. 12, They rewarded me evil for good, to the spoiling of
   my soul.' But in ver. 13, he saith, When they were sick, my clothing
   was sackcloth, I humbled my soul with fasting.' It is much that the
   scripture requireth obedience in the least and lowest offices, where
   one would think our care were excused: Exod. xxiii. 4, 5, If thou meet
   thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it
   back to him again. If thou seest the ass of him that hateth thee lying
   under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely
   help with him.' To reduce the straying ox or ass, and to ease the
   oppressed, these are offices of humanity that men express to their
   friends; but God requireth it to enemies: Do good to them that hate
   you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you,'
   Mat. v. 44. Nay, do not excuse yourselves by a colour and show of
   religion. Religion, that should be the judge, is a party, and the
   restraint is made the fuel to passion. The very persecutors are named.
   We are apt to allow ourselves in the exorbitancy of our passions, under
   the colourable pretences of religion and duty; nay, not only when it is
   your enemy, but God's: when a man is a persecutor, you are to do him
   good.

   3. To do the best good for them, not only to wish them all the good in
   the world, but seek the good of their souls. Christ prayed, Father,
   forgive them;' that God would convince them of their sin, and reform
   and pardon them. Thus John converted a man that came to rob him. Our
   duty is expressed, not only by doing good, but by blessing and praying
   for them, Mat. v. 44. You should mind their good; pity poor blind
   souls, which we too often neglect for our friends, and those to whom we
   are engaged. Oh, when have you done this to those that have wronged and
   injured you? Alas! they have no light, they have no better principles;
   go and mourn over their souls to God. What sweet comfort shall a man
   have in his spirit, when he doth so really mind their good. This is a
   hard lesson, how shall we make it easy?

   [1.] Consider you have God the Father's pattern for it, and the special
   precept of Christ for it: Do good to them that hate you, bless them
   that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and
   persecute you.' And you have the pattern of Christ for it, who prayed
   for the persecutors and transgressors. And the pattern of God the
   Father: Mat. v. 45, He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the
   good, and sendeth rain on the just and unjust.' They come not by chance
   and the ordinary course of nature. None can be so much an enemy to you
   as sinners are to God, yet they have his rain and his sun. It is at
   God's disposal to exclude their right; there are none of these things
   but God could keep from them, and that justly too. yet it is godlike to
   bestow them, and it is man's perfection. It is the glory of man to
   imitate the superior beings, God and angels. Children, you know, when
   they first come to have the use of their reason, their pride is to
   imitate the actions of grown men. Why should not we then imitate those
   of God? Nay, further, you have the pattern of the saints, as well as
   the pattern of the Most High, that you may not think it an inimitable
   pattern. Stephen cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to
   their charge,' Acts vii. 60. Note his vehemency, He cried with a loud
   voice;' his tender love and compassion, Lord, lay not this sin to their
   charge.' The sense of your privileges and prerogative should make you
   do more than others. It was an accusation, 1 Cor. iii. 3, Ye walk as
   men.' Should not Christians do more than publicans and heathens? Mat.
   v. 46, If ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? Do not even
   the publicans the same?' Christians must have something eximious and
   rare. Where is your differing excellency? Oh, go and shame your selves
   with these considerations.

   [2.] Consider the inducements; such as these:--

   (1.) The calmness of your spirit. If ever any were wise, they are wise
   that get and keep this frame of spirit. Men would find more pleasure in
   holy meekness and Christian endeavours for patience, than possibly they
   can in the pleasure of revenge. Vexations disturb the quiet of the
   heart; not only your affections, but your consciences. For can I do
   mine enemy a greater pleasure than to let him take away my contentment
   from me? It is a madness, when I am wronged by others, to wrong myself.
   David's heart smote him for cutting off the lap of Saul's garment, that
   was his enemy; but what a comfort is it when, like an oak, we can
   endure the angry blasts in an unmoveable posture.

   (2.) The likelihood of gaining upon them. Saul wept when he saw David's
   tenderness towards him: 1 Sam. xxiv. 19, If a man find his enemy, will
   he let him go well away?' This is not usual. It is expressed by heaping
   coals of fire upon his head,' Prov. xxv. 22. You may make him pliable
   to your purposes. They are men of distorted depraved natures, that will
   not be won by kindness.

   (3.) Your acceptance with God: Prov. xxv. 22, And the Lord shall reward
   thee.' You will say, it will be labour lost. The sincere endeavours of
   duty are not lost with God; the Lord shall reward thee. Christ did much
   for the unthankful Jews, but he comforts himself with this, My reward
   is with thee.' A pattern for ministers to deal with opposers in
   meekness; you get nothing but scorn and contempt with men, but your
   judgment is with the Lord. There is much comfort in the sincerity and
   faithfulness of your endeavours.

   Secondly, Look upon this intercession of Christ as a part of his
   mediation. Oh, what a glorious instance is this of Christ's love! what
   a pledge and token of those bounteous dispositions that are in his
   heart to poor sinners! Do but consider the circumstances that may
   commend it to you:--

   1. Who prayeth: Christ, one that could destroy them with his glory easy
   enough. We say we forgive men when we cannot harm them; power efferates
   the mind; many would be cruel enough if it were in their power. Christ
   could command twelve legions of angels if he would have prayed in
   another strain: Mat. xxvi. 53, Thinkest thou that I cannot pray to my
   Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of
   angels?' But he doth not say, Father, send me twelve legions of
   angels;' but, Father, forgive them.' Alas! one angel was enough, 2
   Kings xix. 35, to destroy a hundred fourscore and five thousand in
   Sennacherib's camp. But he prayeth for plenty of compassions, though in
   man's eye the other would have been a rare vindication of his glory.

   2. Consider when he prayed. In the very act of his sufferings he seeks
   mercy for the instruments of his sufferings; he is full of love when
   the world is full of spite: 1 Cor. xi. 23, The same night in which he
   was betrayed, he took bread.' When they were devising mischief, he was
   devising comfort. He taketh Paul, Acts ix., breathing out threatenings;
   and scorners have been brought upon their faces by an ordinance. We
   pardon when got rid of the misery, and perceive it is advantageous to
   us; but Christ pardons in the height of his sorrows. A man would have
   thought that the sharp sense of his sufferings should have embittered
   his spirit. Oh, the invincible love of Christ to poor sinners! It is
   much that he intercedeth in heaven; but that he should upon the cross
   say, Father, forgive them,' we cannot but admire and adore till there
   be no spirit left within us.

   3. For whom he prayed. For the transgressors, vile sinners, that
   offered him all the indignities in the world; them that had mocked,
   buffeted, spit upon him, and by their clamorous importunity got him to
   the cross, and gave him vinegar to drink, and placed him between two
   malefactors, and desired a murderer to be released before him. They
   cursed themselves, His blood be upon us;' they prayed backward, as we
   say, for themselves. He was placed between two thieves. Now, he made
   intercession for these transgressors. Go home now, and see if you can
   find any just exception, among all your sins, against the love of
   Christ. Come and urge it; he prayed for the transgressors, for scorners
   of love, men that did not pray for themselves, injurious, blasphemers;
   name anything of higher aggravations; for those that scorned him in the
   very service and labour of love. Holy David vowed he would cut off all
   in the house of Nabal, that scorned and slighted his love. He vowed,
   but Christ prayed for such.

   4. How he prayed. He pleadeth for them: Forgive them, for they know not
   what they do.' You see he pitcheth upon the most favour able
   construction that could be made of their fact; it is a bad fact, but
   they are poor ignorant people. Arguments in prayer imply earnestness;
   and Christ useth such an argument as might most lessen the offence, and
   be accepted with God. The usual plea is bare ignorance; and therefore
   Peter useth that: Acts iii. 17, I wot ye did it in ignorance.' So Acts
   xvii. 30, The times of ignorance God winked at.' So 1 Tim. i. 13, I did
   it ignorantly, and in unbelief.' If any excuse will serve, that doth.
   Oh, consider how willing Christ is to save poor lost sinners! Here is a
   great deal of comfort for poor, humble souls, who ever they be.

   [1.] Are they men that are sensible of their natural estate, oppressed
   with the sense of their sins, that think Christ will not regard them?
   He prayeth for the transgressors. Cannot you believe? See that place,
   John xvi. 10, He shall convince the world of righteousness, for I go to
   the Father.' Christ is gone to send the comforting Spirit, that shall
   give you clear gospel; he is gone to heaven to plead with the Father
   for you. You desire to believe, and Christ prayeth that you may. Do not
   think that Christ is only careful of the elect regenerate, he is also
   careful of the elect uncalled: John x. 16, And other sheep I have,
   which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear
   my voice.' He hath regard to those in that state you apprehend
   yourselves to be in. And he doth not only care for you, but pray for
   you: John xvii. 20, Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also
   who shall believe on me through their word.' As he wooeth you by his
   Spirit, so the Father for your sakes. Would you believe, then all were
   clear: Christ is praying you may believe. You are dealing with
   yourselves, with your own hearts, and Christ is dealing with the Father
   in heaven about the same matter. There is comfort in this word
   transgressors.

   [2.] Are they believers that groan under wants, or inward and outward
   distresses? Christ, that interceded for transgressors, certainly will
   intercede for you. Oh, if unbelievers have comfortable hopes--Christ
   prayed for them--what will he do for you? It is a mighty comfort that
   you have by Christ's intercession what you would have: Jer. xxx. 21,
   Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me, saith the
   Lord?' Christ hath engaged all his bowels and pities, that he will draw
   nigh to God, and plead with him for your sakes. Christ prayeth when you
   pray; the Spirit of Christ prays in you, and Christ himself prays for
   you. What is it that troubleth you? Do the cares of the world encroach
   upon your spirits and encumber them? Or else are you dejected by the
   fears and sorrows of it? In John xvii. 15, Christ prayed that you might
   be kept from the evil' of the world, either the one or the other way.
   Do you want the comforts of the Spirit, and do you sit in darkness, and
   see no light? John xiv. 16, 17, I will pray the Father, and he shall
   give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even
   the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth
   him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth with
   you, and shall be in you.' Is it opposition against your private
   endeavours in duty, or public endeavours for reformation? Zech. iii. 2,
   And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee.' Is it for unity
   among God's people? John xvii. 21, That they may be one, as thou,
   Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.' Or
   for success in duties? Rev. viii. 3, 4, Another angel came and stood at
   the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much
   incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon
   the golden altar which was before the throne: and the smoke of the
   incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before
   God out of the angel's hand.' Or is it for deliverance? Zech. i. 12,
   And the angel of the Lord answered and said, How long wilt thou not
   have mercy upon Jerusalem?' And he would not give over till God gave
   him some comfortable words, ver. 13.

   And he made intercession for the transgressors.

   The last observation from this last clause is this:--

   That Jesus Christ is, and is alone, the Intercessor for poor sinners.

   I shall be very brief on this point, because so many English authors
   have treated upon it, to whose judicious resolution I refer you.

   Now, that Jesus Christ is so, appeareth by many places, which show this
   is his work now in heaven: Rom. viii. 34, It is Christ that died, yea,
   rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
   also maketh intercession for us;' Heb. vii. 25, Who liveth for ever, to
   make intercession for us.' It is the business of his endless life. And
   that he alone is the Intercessor is also fully manifest from the
   scripture: Isa. lix. 16, And he saw, and there was no man, and wondered
   that there was no intercessor;' no man that would come between him and
   wrath, though the case of his people was sad and deplorable: Isa.
   lxiii. 5, I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that
   there was none to uphold.' The prophet speaketh there as if it were the
   inquiry of God's eternal thoughts to find out a meet person for
   intercessor, but none could be found. But why is Christ the alone
   Intercessor? The reasons of the point are:--

   1. To answer the high priest under the law, who was not only to slay
   the sacrifice, but to intercede; both were the duties of the priest
   hood. First, the beast was slain without the camp, and then blood was
   carried into the holy of holies, and then prayers were made. This the
   apostle proveth in the Epistle to the Hebrews, chap. xiii. 11, For the
   bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the
   high priest for sin, are burnt without the camp.' So Christ, after he
   had offered himself a sacrifice for sin, is set down at the right hand
   of the Majesty on high.' Heb. i. 3, and in many other places. We were
   to have a perfect high priest in all points.

   2. To carry salvation in a way of mercy as well as justice, and to have
   it by entreaty as well as satisfaction, Lev. xvi. 14, as the high
   priest was to bring the blood within the veil, and to sprinkle it on
   the mercy-seat, so our High Priest, having satisfied divine justice, by
   giving himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God, he hath
   carried blood within the veil, so that now we may take hold of God with
   both hands, we may present the satisfaction of Christ, and yet beg
   mercy. The sending of Christ did not only glorify justice, but grace;
   and, therefore, Christ's address must be to both: Rom. iii. 24, Being
   justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus
   Christ.' There was an act of free grace as well as justice. These two
   are sweetly coupled together: Ask of me, and I will give thee,' Ps. ii.
   8. Though it were his purchased inheritance, yet he would ask.

   But secondly, Why is it Christ alone?

   1. Because none else would undertake it; none of the creatures have
   such bounteous affections: John xv f 13, Greater love hath no man than
   this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' The two emphatical
   words are life and friends. Some creatures have gone far, as Abraham in
   offering his son. Lot his two daughters, and the father of the Levite's
   concubine in Judges.

   2. Because none could intercede and come between wrath and justice, as
   Christ did. Not man for man; one rebel cannot under take for another:
   Ps. xlix. 7, None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give
   to God a ransom for him.' One man cannot undertake for another. It
   became us to have a high priest, who was holy, harmless, and undefiled,
   separate from sinners.' Nor any angel, for he would have perished in
   the attempt; they needed an intercessor themselves to confirm them.

   But what is this intercession? I shall open the matter to you a little.
   The word signifieth coming between; one that undertaketh for us, that
   intercedeth for us; that was the duty of the high priest after slaying
   the sacrifice. This Christ did as a high priest, after offering himself
   upon the cross.

   For distinctness sake I shall give you the parts. This intercession is
   despatched:--

   1. Partly in heaven; and--

   2. Partly in the hearts of believers.

   1. Partly in heaven. There these acts are performed by Christ:--

   [1.] His presenting himself in our natures, and in our stead: Heb. ix.
   24, he is said to appear in the presence of God for us.' Christ is not
   entered into the holy place made with hands, but into heaven itself.'
   The high priest had the names of the twelve tribes written on his
   breast, and Christ the names of his redeemed ones on his heart. *He
   cometh there not only in our nature, but as our common person, as one
   that was to represent, and to do our business with the Father.

   [2.] He presents his own merits, that the Father may turn his eyes from
   us, and look upon that everlasting righteousness that he brought with
   him into heaven in our nature. He bringeth his blood within the veil.
   Though Christ were on earth, yet he could not despatch all his offices
   of priesthood on earth, as those that had to do with typical
   sacrifices: Heb. viii. 4, For if he were on earth he should not be a
   priest, seeing that there priests offer gifts according to the law.'
   And this blood of Christ is the blood of sprinkling, which speaketh
   better things than that of Abel,' Heb. xii. 24. We by our sins causing
   the Lord Christ to die, had deserved that his blood should speak
   against us, as Abel's did against Cain; no, but it speaketh to God to
   pacify wrath, and pardon our sins, and give peace to our consciences.
   These merits plead hard for us, which is what we call the mediation of
   Christ.

   3. He undertaketh for us, and promiseth obedience to God the Father in
   our behalf; therefore he is said to be our surety, Heb. vii. 22. He
   promiseth that we shall subscribe to the conditions of God, and pass
   over into the power of the covenant.

   4. He prayeth and intercedeth, and maketh his request for us, as being
   sensible of our infirmities, as the high priest was to bless the
   people, that is, to pray for them. Therefore it is said, 1 John ii. 2,
   We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.' There
   Christ is dealing with God for us. When he was here upon earth, he was
   a-praying whole nights, and there he is praying whole ages: Jer. xxx.
   21, Their governor shall proceed from the midst of them, and I will
   cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: who is this that
   engageth his heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord.' His heart is
   engaged, even all his bowels and pities, to draw near to God, and plead
   with him for your sakes. These are the acts of Christ's intercession in
   heaven.

   2. In the hearts of his people; and there the acts of Christ coming
   between us and wrath are these two:--

   [1.] He applieth his merit: the application is by virtue of his
   intercession. The scriptures everywhere put a great deal of weight upon
   this, Rom. v. 10. Therefore it is said, Much more being reconciled, we
   shall be saved by his life.' He beginneth to save us here by his
   Spirit, sanctifying all inward and outward means for the bringing of us
   to the full participation of all the benefits he hath purchased for us;
   but the actual application is afterwards.

   [2.] He prays in us. The Spirit's interceding in our hearts is but the
   answer and echo of Christ's intercession in heaven: Rom. viii. 26, The
   Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what to pray for
   as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with
   groanings which cannot be uttered.' The workings of Christ's Spirit in
   prayer show how Christ's heart is affected towards you in heaven.

   Use. Is comfort. Think of Christ as a Mediator and Intercessor, for
   whose sake we shall be accepted with God. To open this comfort,
   consider for whom he prayeth, not only for present believers, but for
   all them that shall believe hereafter. For what? All mercies, the
   public glorifying of God's name: John xii. 30, This voice came not
   because of me, but for your sakes.' Private acceptance in duties,
   efficacy of ordinances, doing away guilt in holy services. Exod.
   xxviii. 38, the high priest was to bear the iniquity of their holy
   things. Here is comfort in Christ's success in prayer: the Father
   always heareth him, John xi. 42. In the person praying, the Son of his
   love, a Son that hath made satisfaction; he can bring blood with him.
   It is a great privilege for us to pray to God, but it is a much greater
   to have God praying for us.
