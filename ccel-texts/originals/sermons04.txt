SERMON I.

  CHRIST'S LOVE TO US OUR LAW OF LIFE.

    2 COR. v. 14.

   "The love of Christ constraineth us."

   IN the sight of the world, that is, of its wise, refined, easy, and
   prudent men, the life of St. Paul was rashness and folly. His whole
   mind to them was strange and unintelligible. He and the world were
   contradictions. In all its ways, aims, and judgments, it was set
   against him, and he against it. He and the world had no common
   language, idea, or law of life.

   Once he had enjoyed all its good things,--a fair name, a great
   reputation, high authority, distinguished trusts, a character for
   learning, zeal, and strictness, the tide of popularity, and the peace
   of home.

   And of all this he had made a voluntary wreck. In one hour he had cast
   it from him. All that the world counts dearest he had thrown away; all
   that the world most shrinks from he had embraced. At all times and in
   all places he was suffering now as an apostate and a betrayer. His own
   people hated him; the Heathen scorned him. In Jerusalem, where he once
   was held in honour, men sought to kill him; in the luxury of Corinth
   and in the pride of Athens he was a madman and a babbler. Such was his
   outward life as the world saw it, and wondered. It knew not the
   interpretation of the mystery. What is its true solution? "Whether we
   be beside ourselves," he says, "it is to God: or whether we be sober,
   it is for your cause. For the love of Christ constraineth us."

   A power the world knew not of had fallen upon him; an attraction had
   fastened on his inmost will, and drew him to a world unseen. That which
   had drawn Peter, James, and John from their boats and from their
   kindred, Nathanael from his shade and solitude, Matthew from his custom
   and commerce, Mary Magdalene from her sins, had now, in turn, fastened
   upon him. As he journeyed to Damascus, breathing hatred to the name of
   Jesus, the love of Christ fell upon him. A light, above the brightness
   of the sun, encompassed him. A drop of light, a drop of the heavenly
   flame, fell into his soul, and set him all on fire. The love of Christ
   smote him to the ground. A revelation of the love divine, of which he
   was a special object; a consciousness of the eternal love withstanding
   him in his blind career; this expelled his old self, and awakened a new
   principle of life. He was lifted into a new sphere of consciousness,
   and his whole being now flowed in a new channel. He saw himself, for
   the first time, in his true deformity. All that he had believed to be
   light turned into darkness, and his fairest purposes, in his own sight,
   became unclean. He beheld himself guilty, and yet beloved. He saw the
   love of God in His Son to be so much the more miraculous as he thrilled
   with a piercing conviction that he was indeed the chief of sinners. [1]
   Therefore he counted all his worldly gains to be but loss for Christ:
   all that he had been, possessed, or hoped for, was gladly cast away.
   His eyes had opened upon the unseen world. The true Jerusalem, the city
   of the Son of David, the mother of Saints, the home of Patriarchs and
   Prophets, floated above his path. Jesus, whom he had persecuted, stood
   as a King at the right hand of God, as the only and true High Priest
   before the true and only altar. Therefore he lived and laboured for his
   heavenly Master in obedience and patience, in fasting and prayer, in
   preaching and suffering, by night and by day, in perils of the deep and
   in perils everywhere; "always bearing about in the body the dying of
   the Lord Jesus," the faint imitation of the cross by which he had been
   redeemed; counting life too short, and himself too worthless, as an
   offering to his Master's service. At the last, he laid down his life
   also for His name's sake. Of all this supernatural change he here gives
   us the true interpretation: "The love of Christ constraineth us;
   because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all
   dead,"--that is, all died with Him,--"and that He died for all, that
   they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto
   Him which died for them, and rose again." [2]

   What, then, is this love of Christ of which St. Paul is speaking?

   He does not here intend our love to Christ, but Christ's love to us.

   We love Him, indeed, because He first loved us. Our love is the
   reflection of the original light,--the heavenly ray bent back again
   towards its source; and where this love towards Him exists, it becomes
   a motive of perpetual service. But this is not St. Paul's intention: he
   is here speaking of the motive of that motive. What is it that awakens
   our love to Him, but His love first to us? Love is the principle of
   obedience, but the principle of love is love. And of this the Apostle
   speaks,--the love which descends from Him to us. Let us begin at this
   source of all.

   God is love, and love is the law of His kingdom. There is a hierarchy
   of love, having its beginning in the Eternal Three, descending from the
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to all orders of created spirits, angelic
   and ministering, and to all creatures in earth and heaven, binding all
   in one. Love is the stooping of the higher to the lower, the Creator to
   the creature, the parent to the child, the stronger to the weaker, the
   sinless to the sinful,--God stooping down to man. The penetrating,
   exalting consciousness that we are objects of the love of God, which
   has its fountains in eternity, has alone made apostles, martyrs,
   saints, and penitents. And this consciousness is awakened in us by a
   sense of the love of Christ. The love that constrains us is the love of
   God manifest in the flesh,--of the Eternal Word incarnate. What was it
   but His everlasting love as God that constrained Him to make Himself of
   no reputation, and take upon Him our manhood? What but His love,
   perfect both in His Godhead and in His manhood, constrained Him to give
   Himself, as God and man, to suffer a life of sorrow and a death of
   agony? This free, spontaneous, ineffable thirst for our salvation was
   the power which drew Him from His throne to the cross. The zeal which
   devoured Him was the fire of His eternal love to sinners; and this
   love, intimately realised, felt, and, if I may so speak, tasted by a
   consciousness of His sympathy and friendship towards us, one by one,
   was the motive which constrained St. Paul to a life of martyrdom.

   See next how this motive works in us: what is the effect of this love
   of Christ upon our life?

   It "constrains;" that is, it lays a force upon us, as a strong hand
   draws us withersoever it will. There are in creation powers of
   attraction which control whole orders of nature; as the loadstone,
   which draws its subjects to itself, and the sun, to which all nature
   answers. These are the constraining forces of the natural world--a
   parable of the attractions of the spirit. We know this by familiar
   experience in our lower life. What awakens love like love? What
   constrains us to the presence of another but a consciousness of his
   love to us? What draws us from among a multitude, and binds us to one
   among all others, but the wakened sense of his affection? We know how
   the eye has power to attract. Countenance and tone of voice are in
   themselves nothing, except as they are channels of this attractive
   force. So is it with the love of Christ. It is the most powerful
   constraint, drawing our whole spiritual nature to itself. We all know
   how a sense of the Divine Presence works upon us; it awes, chastens,
   and supports us: but the consciousness of the love of Christ is
   something more than a sense of His presence. It adds this further
   perception, that He is watching us in love; that He is inviting our
   love to Himself; that He is ordering all our outward state for our
   perfect sanctification, and all our inward life for the perception of
   His personal love. And the sense of His love is the mightiest of all
   constraining motives. It embraces our whole spiritual nature, touches
   it in all its springs, moves it in all its affections, stirs it in all
   its energies. It is the one only universal motive. Hope will make men
   strive, and fear will make men tremble; but love alone will waken love.
   The bliss of heaven will kindle our desire, the anguish of hell will
   make us thrill with alarm; but the love of Christ alone will soften,
   humble, and subdue. It has a response in the whole sphere of our
   spiritual life, in all its higher and lower affections. It kindles
   love, and love kindles all beside. And as it is universal in its
   effect, so it is uniform in its working. Other motives rise and fall in
   their power to constrain; they depend much on outward circumstances;
   they come and go; they are fainter or stronger, as if fitful and
   capricious. Who does not know the truth of this? Who does not know how
   hope and fear, shame and sorrow, joy and thankfulness, devotion and
   resolution, intentions and perseverance, vary with our actual state;
   sometimes, when specially awakened, making deep impression, sometimes
   almost vanishing away? But love never faileth.

   And still more, a consciousness of the love of Christ is, of all, the
   most uniform and changeless principle of life. As, in our lower
   friendships, the consciousness of being loved stays by us at all times,
   through long years, under all trials, even without sensible memorials
   or renewed expressions to assure us; it embraces, moulds, determines
   our whole heart, and constrains us to the person who loves us, making
   his will our will, his wish our law: so with the love of Christ. There
   are spiritual miracles which it alone can work. The soul in man was so
   created, that no other power could satisfy or sway it altogether; no
   other can touch its life to the very quick, and awaken all its
   affections. The love of Christ felt in the heart is the only principle
   of perfect conversion to God. It is very easy to be almost a Christian;
   to be religious in habits and forms, in sensations and emotions, in
   intellect and intention; to be half, or almost altogether converted.
   And it is still easier there to linger, deceiving our own hearts.

   When I speak of conversion, I mean, not only the change which comes in
   after-life upon the sinful and the careless, when they begin to turn
   with tardy steps towards God; but also the whole life-long penetrating
   change of heart which must pass on every regenerate soul. Every fallen
   spirit needs a conversion to God; for flesh and blood cannot inherit
   His kingdom. And whether that change or conversion be in after-life,
   begun too late, and with greater obstructions, or whether it begin with
   our earliest consciousness, as dawn lightens into noon, it is all one.
   Sudden or gradual are but properties of time 3 and time is nothing. The
   change of the soul from sin to God is an universal law; and every
   baptised soul needs a perfect conversion to God. Now, the only true
   motive of this change is a sense of the love of Christ.

   We see its power even from the very font. What is it that draws the
   hearts of children to the service of Christ? Not the great white
   throne; not the face before which heaven and earth shall flee away; but
   the love of Jesus Christ revealed in His words and deeds, and believed
   by them as the atmosphere in which they live. This is about them
   everywhere, drawing them with a calm, even, steadfast motion to
   Himself. From earliest childhood sin is hateful to them, because it is
   hateful to Him; holiness lovely, because Christ loves it. To do or to
   leave any thing undone, it is enough for them to know that so He wills.
   Above the love of brother, sister, or mother, is the love of Him of
   whom the Gospels speak, suffering and dying for love of them. There is
   not upon earth a purer or heavenlier sight than a child listening to
   the life and words, the passion and love of Jesus Christ. The life of
   such is a perpetual conversion, a daily, hourly turning of the whole
   heart to Him. The mind of the flesh dies down in them, as the mind of
   the spirit enlarges its power and fulness, and the darkened face of the
   soul is converted more and more towards Him, until it is filled with
   His brightness, as the moon at the full.

   And this we see also in after-life. What so binds to the cross the
   heart of those who are entering upon the perils of life as the
   consciousness of the love which from the cross descends upon them? The
   love of Christ is the purity and safety of youth. It is their shield in
   temptation, their strength in obedience, their spur in lingering, their
   measure in devotion and service. With what resolved and confiding
   hearts do such renew the vows of their baptism in confirmation; with
   how firm a will do they answer in the words "I do!" With what ardent
   and intent devotion do they come to their first communion; and with
   what ever-increasing desire do they await every return of the holy
   Sacrament.

   All these are true and perfect examples of conversion. Indeed, the
   life-long conversion of the regenerate is the best and most perfect
   form of this great spiritual law. Late conversions are imperfect
   imitations, as "the shooting up of the latter growth;" "the latter
   growth after the king's mowings;" [3] for the bloom and the freshness
   are His. Nature has its tardy and scantier compensations, its
   after-fruits, and gleanings when the harvest is done. Such are most
   conversions of which the world takes note, because contrasts are
   objects of sense, while changes are objects of faith alone.

   But let us take examples of such later and commoner conversions. What
   is it but the power of this constraining love which bends the will of
   those who, after baptism, fall, and yet repent? What is it that most
   deeply moves and changes the sinful, worldly, and wasted heart? What
   turned Saul from his career of blood, recalled Peter from his denials,
   drew sinners to wash His feet with tears? The tenderness, the look, the
   voice of love. The shame, sorrow, indignation, revenge of penitents
   spring from the too late awakened consciousness of the love against
   which they have been sinning, The greater the love, the greater their
   offending: the more deeply it is perceived, the more fervent their
   repentance.

   But there is another effect of this love when it is felt in the heart.
   It is the only source of unreserved devotion, and of perfect sacrifice
   of self. Many other motives draw us to partial obedience and to lesser
   self-denials. I need not speak of false and spurious motives, such as
   fanaticism, vain-glory, self-exaltation, which will lead men into great
   undertakings or perils under the plea of religion; much less need I
   speak of baser and earthlier motives. There is always a glare, a heat,
   and a noise about such characters, a restless, eager sharpness in their
   tone and way, which betrays the source of the fire from which they are
   kindled to be not in heaven but earth. We are now speaking of such
   motives as act upon sincere and religious hearts. In such persons we
   often see, with much of seriousness, goodness, and high aspiration,
   something which always keeps them down. They are at peace with the
   world, are esteemed by the majority, trusted by those who will not
   trust each other. They are esteemed prudent, discreet, and safe. Their
   life ruffles no one; is in keeping with the ways, hours, comfort, ease,
   enjoyment of society. And yet they are often charitable, earnest, and
   on the right side. But there is one visible defect. They want range,
   force, freedom, and a fearless spirit. In religious duties they take
   counsel of men less religious than themselves. They use the weights and
   measures of civilisation, of refinement, and of what the world calls
   possible. The one thing they lack is boldness to be "fools for Christ's
   sake." Such was not the spirit of those who in all ages have done or
   suffered great things for the kingdom of God. They knew no motive but
   the love of Christ. All other motives ran up into this, and were lost,
   as lesser forces are united in a greater. With what unreserved and
   generous affections did they give themselves to His service. It was not
   a cold conviction of truth, or a mere sentiment of its beauty, or a
   rule of conscience, or the encouragement of human esteem, or a passing
   fervour, or a fear of pains beyond the grave, or even a hope of eternal
   peace; none of these sufficed to set on fire those who have converted
   nations, planted churches, founded religious orders, kindled and
   moulded a spiritual lineage to tend the sick, instruct the ignorant,
   educate little children, reclaim sinners, redeem captives, pluck brands
   from the burning. For this there was needed a higher, deeper, mightier
   impulse, in which all hopes and fears are extinguished; a motive which
   breaks down the measures of self and of the world on every side, and
   can be meted only by a measure which is divine. The love of Christ
   constrained them. His love to them was the measure of their
   self-sacrifice for Him. Therefore they gladly forsook friends, home,
   and all things, that they might find Him enough alone. They had
   received the fire which falls from heaven, and, as it kindled, their
   hearts pleaded with them in secret and piercing words, "He wholly gave
   Himself for me; shall I give less to Him? I am altogether His in body,
   soul, and spirit. Shall I keep back what is His own? Shall I profess to
   serve Him with all I am, and keep back a part of the price, my heart
   being privy to it? My fearful, shrinking, delicate, ungenerous spirit
   makes me draw back from loneliness, danger, hardship, and peril of
   death. Yet I desire to live for Him, and to die for Him. If He would
   but give me the grace and the will to die to myself, and fear nothing;
   the love to kindle my whole soul for Him, as He was consumed by love
   for me; even I should dare to say, To me to live is Christ, and to die
   is gain.'" [4]

   But there is still one more effect of this divine motive. It is the
   only principle of an enduring perseverance. We know how any personal
   affection grows upon us, and becomes a part of our very life. All our
   consciousness is so pervaded by it, that we cannot distinguish it from
   a direct instinct of the soul. It grows stronger as it acts: by acting
   it is made perfect. Long trials of Christ's love in joy and sorrow, in
   storm and sunshine, reveal its divine tenderness and depth. And this
   quickens the activity of our own hearts with a living, thirsting desire
   to love Him with a greater love again. All the powers of our spiritual
   life are drawn to this point. They meet as in a focus, and kindle each
   other by uniting. Steadfast love is perseverance; it supports through
   all weariness and disappointment, all allurement and alarm. A true love
   to Christ moves in its path year by year, from strength to strength,
   without haste but without tarrying, calm, bright, and onward as the
   light of heaven. Take any example you will. Out of this one motive
   arise all motives. See what solace it has for every trial. Sometimes it
   brings persevering obedience, sometimes persevering patience. In a
   burdened life of worldly cares, what support it is to know, "This is
   His appointment; He gives it me because He loves me. Shall I not bear
   this for Him who bore all for me?" Or if it be weariness in the
   religious life, as of communicants who at the altar find no sweetness,
   only emptiness and reluctance, let them say, "How long did He love me
   much, and I loved Him little! How long did He wait for my love, and I
   would not! Now I must wait for Him; justly chastened by His love;
   slighted but not estranged." Take, again, those on whom the cloud of
   sorrow has fallen. Their happiness was stately and full, spreading
   abroad as the cedar. In one hour it withered away. Why? He loved you
   too well to lose you. In His love He smote you. He breathed upon your
   aspiring happiness, and it dried up from the very root. He cleared all
   away between Himself and you, that you might be conscious of His
   personal love, and choose it as your portion for ever.

   Or perhaps you have been reaching out for a happiness you have never
   attained: the hope of your heart was dashed upon the threshold. When it
   seemed all your own, a sudden change came, and it was not. And why?
   Because the love of Christ had some better thing in store for you. Can
   you not trust Him? Is He not wise as loving? Are not your treasures in
   His hand? Do you love them as He loves? Are they not safer with Him
   than with you?

   Or it may be that you have to bear long lingering sickness, with
   memories of sorrow and pain. The cross lay early upon you, and has
   never departed from your soul. Be sure that the love of Christ has in
   store for you some greater things hereafter. It may be the right hand
   or the left in His kingdom. God knoweth; but if so, the cup and the
   baptism must come first. And the cup which His love hath given you,
   shall you not drink it?

   And as in patience, so in hard and enduring service. What but the
   consciousness of this love could uphold a pastor's heart, wearied out
   by contradictions, wasted away with toiling for "souls that will not be
   redeemed?" It is His work, and that is enough. He will not disown it.
   Though men believe not, He abideth faithful. Let me labour alone and
   without fruit unto the last, so He love me still. Let me please Him and
   faint not; let me offend all the world, so I be accepted as His
   servant.

   Above all, what other spring, and what other stay of perseverance is
   there to His hardier and bolder servants, who, choosing for their
   portion the full burden of His cross, go out into far lands, without
   father, without mother, without home or kindred, alone with Him Who is
   their love, to gather souls into His kingdom? What is there to sustain
   the craving and weakness of humanity, in the weariness of solitude, and
   under the burden of their own isolated hearts? There is but the love of
   Christ beneath them and around. The outer hardships of sky and shore,
   rude natures and savage wills, are nothing to the lonely world within.
   But their Master's love is enough. They know by intuitions of the
   heart, and by perceptions of their whole inward life, that He loves
   them, and gave Himself for them. They have but faintly done the like:
   for love they have given themselves in behalf of His elect. He loves
   them, and they love Him again. Who shall unloose this knot? Who shall
   unravel the strength of this heavenly bond? Who shall separate them
   from the love of Christ? When memories of home, fond faces, beloved
   images, rise thick and crowd upon them; when what they have lost seems
   a paradise, and their present life a desolation; when the human heart,
   for a passing moment, is too strong, and love and sorrow turn towards
   earth again; when failures, miscalculations, hasty steps, hopeless
   efforts, unforeseen reverses, beginnings abandoned, and aims missed at
   the very stroke, come back upon them, then it may be they grow weak,
   and ask, "Have I not acted in a false excitement, and bound myself to
   one life-long mistake? When I was in my own land, was it not well with
   me? Might I not have served Him truly, as others before and now, in the
   midst of peace and home, doing good work among my own people and by my
   father's house? Why have I come hither, exiled and cut off, bound by an
   irrevocable word?"

   Because the love of Christ constrained them, therefore they are alone
   with Him in the wilderness. They have chosen well, and nobly followed
   out their choice. They shall never fail, nor be forsaken; never faint,
   nor weary. Though for a moment flesh and blood may make its pleading
   heard, yet the consciousness of their Master's love shall arise again
   to put all questioning down. It, shall bear them unto the end. As the
   ark went upon the face of the waters, so shall they be upheld by the
   everlasting love, sustaining and wafting them to the eternal shore.

   Such are the powers of this constraining love. It is the motive and
   solace of every faithful soul--the mightiest, purest, most inflexible
   law of a devout and persevering faith.

   Do we so find it working in us? If not, why not? Because, before it can
   thus work in us conversion, devotion, or perseverance, we must feel
   this love, and, if I may so say, taste it by the spiritual perception
   of our hearts.

   Perhaps we are conscious, as the chief fact of our spiritual life, that
   we have no such perception. We can, indeed, feel the love of kindred
   and of friends. This wakens and stirs us to live for them and in them.
   But His love falls coldly and without power upon us. We know it as a
   theory of faith, but we have no sense of it in our heart. Why is this?
   Why is it that some walk in the noonday sun, but are never kindled by
   its warmth? The coldness is in themselves: they carry it in their
   life-blood. So it is with the soul. There is some inward resistance,
   some palsying chill, some failure of vital power; something which
   deadens their sense and clouds their perception. Though the love of
   Christ has encompassed them from childhood, they have been unmoved and
   senseless.

   Now, there are two things which chiefly hinder our perception of the
   love of Christ. The one is sin, wilfully committed; the other is a
   spirit at variance with His, consciously indulged. If, then, you are
   conscious of insensibility, examine yourself for the cause.

   1. First ask yourself this question: Am I wilfully indulging in my
   conscience any sin which He hates? So long as we wilfully harbour any
   conscious evil, we must be cold and dead towards Him. I am speaking,
   not of the guilt of sin, but of its effect upon our inward state. Every
   grosser sin, as sensuality, excess in meat or drink, deadens the soul,
   and makes it as the body, drowsy and heavy. It becomes unfit for the
   perception of the love of Christ. So also all spiritual sins, such as
   anger, envy, pride, a double mind, and an evil tongue; or again, sloth,
   which is a sin both of the body and of the spirit, full of baseness and
   dishonour to our Lord and to ourselves. And besides these, there is one
   sin very common to Christians, and most provoking in His sight--the sin
   of inconstancy, the irresolute wavering between hot and cold, the
   lukewarm indifference which turns away from a religious life after a
   beginning has been made, as if all were known and despised as
   tasteless, sapless, and unpalatable.

   These sins deaden the heart, and raise grave doubts within, whether it
   be possible that He can love such as we are. And doubts bring on fears,
   and fears estrangements. We shrink with a consciousness that we are
   unworthy of His love; and that shrinking estranges us the more, and
   hinders the first emotions of love to Him. Can you detect any such in
   yourselves, be it only in thought, memory, imagination? for spiritual
   sins deaden spiritual perceptions. Our hearts must first be cleansed,
   and their senses made quick and apprehensive. How can love constrain
   us, so long as we do not feel it? and how can we feel it, so long as
   our hearts are dead? But perhaps you will say, I am not conscious of
   indulging any sin which He hates, even in thought.

   2. Then there is another question we must ask: Am I striving to be all
   that He loves? How long we are in learning that holiness is not a
   negative but a positive endowment. It does not consist only in not
   sinning, but in actual sanctity. We may be clear from gross sin, and
   yet have no love for Him. We may not be living for this world, and yet
   not be living for the next. Our mind may not be "earthly, sensual,
   devilish," and yet have no likeness to the mind of Christ. There is a
   worldliness which is pure, a hardness of heart which is refined, and a
   selfishness which is decent and dissembled. These never offend by gross
   or startling sins, but they are far from the fellowship of Christ and
   of God. How can hearts stunned by the world, or doating upon its
   material goods, perceive the love of Christ? Their faculties, their
   very organisation, are too gross and earthly. When, then, St. Paul
   speaks of holiness, "without which no man shall see the Lord," he means
   a positive endowment of the soul. Just as the intellect is developed
   and trained by the discipline of science, so as to awaken new
   faculties, powers, and perceptions, and to bring a new range of objects
   within its sphere of intelligence and of fruition, so is it with
   holiness, without which no man shall see God. Sanctity is a state and
   discipline of the soul, awakened, unfolded, and empowered by the Spirit
   of God, to know, love, and delight in Him. It implants spiritual
   faculties, senses, affections; it creates a spiritual consciousness,
   whereby we dwell in God, and God in us. This is the wedding-garment,
   for lack of which the guest at the marriage-supper was cast out; "the
   white raiment," clean and white, "the righteousness of Saints;" "the
   mind of Christ;" the heavenly endowment of which the Apostle speaks
   when he says, "Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ." It is a positive
   spiritual state, to be attained only by God's gift through prayer, and
   a will united to His will. Where this union exists, the grace of the
   Spirit of God and the perfections of the mind of Christ descend into
   the heart. From this source alone we receive gentleness, lowliness,
   purity, self-denial, self-forgetfulness, and all the heavenly
   beatitudes. And as we are made like to Him, we are drawn to Him, and by
   nearness perceive His love to us, and learn to delight in Him, dwelling
   in the consciousness of His love. Have you attained this state? Are you
   striving for it?

   But you will perhaps say, All this I have striven to do, and yet I feel
   cold and insensible. I have known the love of Christ from my childhood,
   but never felt it. It has been a conviction of my reason, but not a
   perception of my heart. Do what I will, I remain still unmoved and
   hard, as if there were no love descending with the fulness of God upon
   me.

   3. There remains, then, one thing still to do. Pray Him to make you
   feel His love. St. Paul felt nothing till it fell from heaven upon him.
   We cannot awaken this sense in ourselves, any more than we can open
   eyes that are blind. "Every good and every perfect gift is from above,
   and cometh down from the Father of lights." There is One alone who can
   make "the sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and send His rain
   upon the just and upon the unjust." Pray Him to lift up the light of
   His love upon you; to reveal to you the mystical cross, the book of His
   love which passeth knowledge, and to give you grace with all saints to
   read it in its length, breadth, depth, and height. It is by no
   mechanical work of ours that we can come to a perception of the Heart
   of Jesus Christ. He alone can open it to us, and open our heart to see
   its meaning.

   Let this, then, be your prayer, for prayer is the uniting of our
   consciousness with His Presence. Let it also be your meditation, for
   meditation is the gazing of the spiritual eye upon His love revealed in
   Himself. Let this be your desire in holy communion, for what is it but
   the union of His Spirit with our spirit, His heart with our heart, His
   love with our love? In the sacrament of His Body and Blood His divine
   love kindles our faint affections; and through the mystery of His
   incarnation and His crucifixion, by the wounds in His "hands and His
   side," He reveals His miraculous compassion. Let our prayer be, "Thou
   knowest that I love Thee;" yet not so that I dare say it of myself.
   Forgive my lack of love. I would love Thee, if I could, above kindred,
   friends, home, and life itself. I would fain love Thee so as to desire
   to depart and be with Thee; so as that life may be to me sweet only for
   Thee, and death without fear, because it shall bring me to Thee.

   Let this be your aspiration at the altar, year by year, day by day,
   again and again, always persevering, in every prayer, in every
   communion. Hold Him fast by your supplications, and let Him not go till
   He bless you with this consciousness of love.

   What drew Him down to us but love? what but love can lift us up to Him?
   What but the love of Christ dwelling in His elect is the life of His
   Church on earth; the rest of His Saints unseen? With St. Peter, they
   follow Him in faith; with the beloved disciple, they lie upon His bosom
   and are blest.

   What a gathering shall that be when He shall have fulfilled His
   promise, "And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me;" when,
   by the bands of love and the attractions of His pity and of His
   passion, He shall have drawn all His elect from all ages and from all
   lands, from all kindreds and from all homes, from all sins and from all
   crosses, from all toils and solitude, from all partings and exile, from
   tears and waiting, from doubts and fears, strivings and failings,
   strivings and masteries, to the foot of the Eternal Throne! What a
   meeting, when we shall see Him who hath so loved us eternally; when all
   Saints, from the first unto the last, from the least unto the
   greatest,--all whom He hath loved unto the end, shall stand before Him
   for Whose love's sake they have lived and died, each one in perfect
   personal identity, in perfect mutual recognition,--changed, and yet the
   same; the same in all that we have loved, but changed into more of love
   and bliss than we have ever desired or dreamed--there to serve Him for
   ever before the throne of God our Father!

SERMON II.

  THE SONS OF GOD.

    ROM. viii. 14.

   "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."

   ST. PAUL here shews us what is the end and law of our regeneration. The
   Son of God was made man, that we might be made the sons of God. The
   Holy Ghost came down to continue in us this work of our redemption. We
   were made sons of God by regeneration in the baptism of water and of
   the Holy Ghost. Our adoption was a free, unsought, undeserved, and
   sovereign act of God, for His only Son's sake. Creation was not more
   sovereign, nor was the dust of the ground more passive when the first
   man was made in God's likeness, than we, when, through baptism, we were
   born again as sons of God.

   But St. Paul is here speaking, not of our adoption as it is an act on
   God's part, but of our sonship as it is a spiritual reality and actual
   attainment on our part.

   We were made sons by baptism: we become sons by obedience. How can we
   become sons, if we were already made so? As we were made man by our
   natural birth, whereby we obtained the nature and capacities of
   manhood, we become men by natural growth, whereby what is in germ and
   virtue becomes actual and perfect.

   It is in this sense that St. John says, "As many as received Him, to
   them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe
   on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the
   flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." [5] Baptism is our
   adoption, as birth is our life. As life is natural birth produced, so
   sonship is the spirit of adoption produced. To be led by spiritual
   instincts, lights, and inspirations, is to become, and therefore in a
   very and eternal reality to be, sons of God.

   But St. Paul does not mean, that none but they who are led by the
   Spirit are sons. The very word led implies obedience to the Spirit of
   adoption. For many are regenerate who will not obey. All who are
   baptised are drawn; but they only are here said to be "led" who follow
   the leading of the Spirit. When St. Paul says, "All are not Israel who
   are of Israel," [6] he does not mean that faithless Israelites are not
   of the lineage of Israel. Nor, when our Lord called Nathanael "an
   Israelite indeed," [7] did He mean that they who were not true to their
   name were not indeed of God's chosen nation. So. in this place, as many
   as follow where the Spirit leads, they are sons of God indeed.

   This, then, is our calling, and this is the test of our adoption.

   How many simply deride it. In this day of light, when we are told that
   manhood is divine, and that, when conscious of his divinity, man is
   what the tempter promised, the grace of God in our adoption is looked
   down upon as a superstition of human childhood, a figment of the mind,
   or a remnant of mediaeval credulity. How many disbelieve it because
   they cannot find it in their own consciousness, therefore cannot
   realise it; and what they cannot realise they deny. How many profess to
   believe, and yet choose their own path, are their own leaders;
   consciously evading the leading of their baptism in all its higher and
   deeper paths, in all that cross their own inclinations. How many stifle
   and lower their spiritual life by empty, unworthy, frivolous trifling;
   by ease, luxury, sloth, softness, self-indulgence, and acquiescence in
   relaxed maxims of the world. How few truly realise the spirit of their
   adoption, and become sons of God in life, energy, and act. How few, I
   mean, realise the personality and presence of the Holy Spirit. How few
   live in the consciousness that they are within the sphere of a Divine
   person, loving, compassionate, long-suffering, who, from their
   childhood, has been guiding and bearing with them.

   Let us, then, try ourselves, and see how it is with us; whether or no
   we be sons of God in that one only sense which shall stand when all
   things shall be tried by fire. For in one sense sons of God we must be
   for ever. We can destroy ourselves, but we cannot efface our baptism;
   we may mar the image of God, but not our baptismal cross; we may
   forfeit the bliss of our adoption, but we cannot evade the doom of
   reprobate sons. This must be our chiefest bliss or our deepest anguish,
   and abide with us for ever. Let us, then, well try ourselves, lest we
   be deceived.

   There are three certain marks by which we may ascertain our true
   sonship.

   1. The first mark is a ready will. It may be asked, How does the Spirit
   of God lead us? In what way? Is it in any way distinguishable from the
   actings of our natural conscience; and if so, how may we distinguish
   it? How am I to know what is His leading? and what am I to do to follow
   it?

   The natural conscience is indeed the throne of the Holy Spirit within
   us. It is the power in us over which He presides, and by which He
   guides us. There is by nature a light which separates between right and
   wrong, between truths and falsehoods; and to this natural light the
   Spirit of God adds yet greater light. There is a light infused by
   baptism which strengthens and extends the light of nature. New
   faculties are awakened in the soul, and new powers implanted. Faith is
   a new sense; and to this sense the realities of the world unseen are
   lifted up. New objects and laws are revealed by the illumination of
   truth; new affections and perceptions are elicited by the inspirations
   of grace. This is the passive state of the soul born again of the
   Spirit. But here the trial begins. It is by our will that we are to be
   proved and judged. In the midst of all this growing, overwhelming
   light, the will may remain stubborn and rebellious. Faults in childhood
   growing into the sins of boyhood, hardening into the entanglements and
   obstinacy of manhood, establish a deliberate resistance in the will
   against the light of the Spirit.

   We often see the most promising forms of character slowly fading off.
   For a time there is a kind of negative declension. No marked and active
   faults appear; but nothing is advancing towards holiness and the mind
   of Christ. They seem for a while to stand still, as we see in an
   arrow's flight a momentary pause before it begins to descend. So they
   never go beyond a certain point; then for a while they hang in
   suspense--then slowly fall. Then some one sin appears, long nourished
   in secret, now at last revealed; some one parasite, which has clung
   about them, and slowly confirmed its grasp around the whole strength
   and stature of their character. And this one sin gives the fatal wound
   to their spiritual life. They deliberately choose this sin; and this
   choice in riper years overmasters the grace of their baptism. The
   responsible agent rejects God's free gift, received in unconsciousness
   at the font.

   So even with refined faults, which equally produce an intense variance
   of the will, and even a more subtil spirit of hostility against God.
   Such, I mean, as pride, ambition, selfishness, fastidious refinement,
   supercilious confidence in self. All these estrange the will from God;
   and the will is the centre and quick of our probation.

   For this estrangement of the will creates reluctance, struggling,
   opposition, and a slavish or rebellious heart. What more miserable
   state than to have our reason clearly convinced of the sovereignty of
   God's Spirit, and our will averted from Him? Such Christians are sons
   by God's grace; but slaves and rebels by their own deliberate choice.

   This, then, is the first mark--a ready will to follow where the light
   of the Spirit leads. When we come to some hard choice between pleasure
   and duty, between a desire to venture and a motion to forbear, we come
   to our place and hour of trial. The motions in our conscience are
   admonitions from God; they are given to be obeyed.

   It is dangerous to delay. When our Lord called one to follow Him, and
   he answered, "Suffer me first to go and bury my father," what answer
   did he receive? "Let the dead bury their dead." [8] So with us;
   hesitation brings reasons for delay; and delay gives time for
   temptation: one hour's delay brings unknown hindrance. The motions of
   God's Spirit are like the flowing of the tide, which, taken at the
   full, will lift us over every bar: tarry and lose them, and we may be
   stranded for ever.

   There is a golden chain, a thread frail and delicate, by which He leads
   us on.

   In some it is drawing them to conversion. Their past life rises up into
   its true shape and colour, and they are moved to flee from it. They see
   its sin, or hollowness, or presumption. Then they are drawn onward to
   holier aspirations and deeper purposes. They desire to turn with their
   whole heart to God, and to begin a life altogether new in aim,
   intention, and character. This is the leading of the Spirit, the crisis
   of their trial.

   In some, again, who have passed beyond this point, it is drawing them
   to the grace of deeper penitence. This keener self-reproach and clearer
   insight into their own sinful consciousness are given them to break up
   the insensible and easy confidence with which some absolve themselves.
   But it is a gift that must be followed.

   In some it is drawing them on from commandments to precepts, from
   precepts to counsels of perfection. The light which rises in the soul,
   if slighted, declines surely to its setting. If we will not go on to
   more devotion, self-denial, and love, we shall fall back into less. To
   some it is as much the crisis of their spiritual life to follow, one by
   one, into the narrower paths of toil, prayer, and the cross, as to
   others to leave the broad way that leadeth to destruction. "To him that
   hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he
   hath shall be taken away." If we hang back, the golden thread may snap
   asunder, and we fall back into any measure of declension.

   Let us beware, then, how we tarry and debate. Lingering is a
   provocation of God's patience. He would be loved and honoured by a free
   and filial service. All depends on a will ready and prompt to obey. Who
   knows what, by a single act of the will, you may gain or lose? You are,
   it may be, at the cross roads, where the ways part asunder,--the one to
   life eternal, the other to eternal death. What you do will leave its
   character in the book of God's remembrance. As we choose, so we shall
   be. What we will we are. Our will is our whole being summed into one
   intense, deliberate act. Resist the Spirit of God, and you may be cast
   out of our Father's sight; follow, and you shall be His sons, by grace,
   for ever.

   2. Another mark of a filial spirit is a loving heart.

   All men are ruled by either love or fear: there is no intermediate
   state. "Perfect love casteth out fear," and a ruling fear casteth out
   love. They may be mingled for a while; but one or the other must bear
   rule and sway at last. And this is a sure criterion. "For ye have not
   received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the
   Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.' [9] He would have
   from us the service of sons, loving, glad, and grateful, without stint
   or measure; not saying, How much must I do? but How much may I, how
   much can I do? How much time, substance, service, or thought can I give
   to Him?

   There are no weights and measures among the vessels of the sanctuary.
   "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
   his friends." He gave Himself wholly for us; what shall we not give to
   Him again? The service of our Father is perfect freedom; fearless, and
   yet fearing alway; fearing to offend; fearing to come short; fearing
   our own unworthiness; fearing to appear in His spotless Presence; but
   fearing nothing else. The true service of sons is pure love: not for
   safety, nor for reward; not to escape hell, nor to gain heaven; hut to
   serve, please, and glorify our Lord, who loved us purely and without
   cause, except His own eternal love.

   Now, what is your motive? Why do you live a Christian life? Why do you
   keep an outward habit of religion? Why do you pray? Why do you
   communicate? Is it from the conclusions of the intellect? because you
   are convinced of the duty, as with a mechanical certainty? Is it
   because such a life beseems the dignity of man, or the order of the
   world, or the well-being of families and the social state? Is it from
   passive and unquestioning dispositions,--a sort of dead bias, gained in
   childhood? Is it from the support of an outward system? the custom of
   others? the daily warnings of the bell? the altar inviting every week?
   Is it that good education has passed into the decorum of life and the
   channel of worldly happiness and worldly interest, and because, with no
   change of heart, your life has fallen into a vague and beaten track? Or
   is it from a conscious filial love to God and to our Lord Jesus Christ?

   If not, what are all these motives? How will they endure the piercing
   of those eyes which are as a flame of fire?

   What is God's kingdom but love? What but love is God's service? What
   are all things,--knowledge and spiritual science, prayers, fasts, alms,
   communions--without love in the heart? The soul that loves not is dead.

   3. And to take one more: a third mark of a filial spirit is a peaceful
   conscience.

   St. Paul says, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that
   we are the children of God." Now in this we may deceive ourselves. Many
   are in peace who have built upon no true foundation. And some who might
   be at peace will not suffer themselves to rest. A peaceful conscience
   must be a clean conscience. The peace of an unsifted conscience is
   either self-deceit or insensibility. None are more at peace in this
   sense than they who have no consciousness of sin, no perception of
   God's presence, no shrinking from His spotless purity.

   But this peace is not the witness of the Spirit with our spirit. It is
   the security of a torpid heart; the stupor of a silent conscience. Easy
   as it is for dark and impure hearts to deceive themselves in this deep
   scrutiny, to cleansed and single hearts all is plain and clear. Our own
   spirit, that is, our whole inward consciousness, bears witness by the
   instinct of its own sincerity, by the steadiness of its desires after
   God, and by its delight in loving and serving Him. Where these things
   are, there can be no self-deceit. Though conscious of manifold
   imperfections, of a multitude of temptations, of frequent faults, and
   of a sinfulness which still cleaves to the soul as mortality to the
   body, yet a sincere heart cannot long or greatly deceive itself. It is
   our ultimate rule, ordained by God Himself. "If our heart condemn us,
   God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our
   heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God." And where
   there is this testimony in our own hearts, there will always be the
   witness also of the Spirit; not by visions or the voice of words, nor
   by peculiar revelations or unusual tokens; but by the calm and steady
   shining of His presence. To every cleansed conscience God gives a
   special clearness of spiritual sight. The objects of faith unveil
   themselves, as the face of the earth when the morning mists ascend. The
   visible world has a limited horizon, near and circumscribed; but the
   world unseen has no boundaries to the gaze of faith. The saints of all
   times and dispensations, the companies of just men made perfect, the
   heavenly court, the throne of God, the purpose, mind, and will of the
   divine kingdom, the reality of all laws and mysteries of grace, stand
   out ever more and more clearly and vividly before the pure in heart.
   And with clearer sight comes greater strength; and with greater
   strength a greater ease in the whole life of faith.

   With this comes also a deeper sense of the presence of God; a sense
   which grows up into a consciousness finer than all thought, and
   independent of all reflection. It is as the consciousness of an eye
   ever upon us,--an eye of love, in which it is happiness to live; a
   countenance ever shining downwards; a light lifted up in token of
   goodwill; a reality out of ourselves and yet within us, or rather in
   which--as in the air or noonday light--we are enshrined, enfolded, and
   encompassed. This is the witness of the Spirit with our spirit;
   something too deep and intimate for words, too high and subtil for
   logical proof; but sure, real, and perceptible by faculties above
   reasoning or sense.

   Have you, then, these three marks of the sons of God: a ready will, a
   loving heart, a peaceful conscience? If so, happy are ye. If not, what
   are you doing, hoping, expecting?

   Take, then, some rules by which to seek this true spirit of a son.
   There are two ways to it:

   1. By learning obedience even in the least things.

   There is nothing small which God has commanded: His greatness makes all
   about Him to be great. Nothing is little by which He may be greatly
   pleased, or greatly offended. A thought is a little thing, and yet it
   may be a great provocation of the divine Majesty; for every sin has the
   whole virus and principle of sin. So every duty, even the least duty,
   involves the whole principle of obedience. And little duties make the
   will dutiful, that is, supple and prompt to obey. Little obediences
   lead into great: "He that is faithful in that which is least is
   faithful also in much."

   The daily round of duty is full of probation and of discipline: it
   trains the will, heart, and conscience. To be holy we need not to be
   prophets or apostles. The commonest life may be full of perfection. The
   duties of home are a discipline for the ministries of heaven. A
   faithful servant has the heart of a son of God. A dutiful child lives
   in the spirit of adoption. An obedient wife exercises the whole grace
   of submission. A faithful pastor may labour in the spirit of an
   apostle; and a soul in wrongs or sufferings may gain a martyr's crown.
   It is specially the common, unnoticed duties of life which are the
   safest and most searching tests. They have no ostentation or
   excitement, but are done from inward force, and a fruitful principle of
   duty.

   2. The other way to a filial spirit is by habitual communion in the
   holy sacrament.

   From the font we are invited to the altar. Once washed, we need to be
   perpetually fed with spiritual food. The life that was breathed into us
   from above cannot be sustained without the Bread of heaven.

   What, then, is the state of those who never communicate? Sinful
   Christians slay their souls by wounds or poison: every sin that a man
   commits violates the gift of life. Slothful Christians starve their
   souls by wasting and exhaustion. Inconstant and irregular communicants
   undermine their spiritual steadfastness. Seldom communions make cold
   communions. Frequent communion is the best preparation for the altar;
   the communion of last Sunday for the next, of yesterday for to-day.

   It is by habitual fellowship with the presence of our Lord that our
   will is united with His will, our heart with His heart, our conscience
   with His Spirit.

   It is by this union that we attain the will to choose His will, the
   will to cross our own. A will turned against itself is a token of the
   presence of God. As, if water should climb upward to its springs, or
   fire turn its points of flame downward to the earth, we should see and
   know that One greater than nature is here; so, when we choose pain and
   reject pleasure, when we will not what we will, but are willing for
   that against which our will is naturally bent, we may adore the
   presence of Him Whose Will gives law to all. Seek Him, then,
   continually in the even obedience of home, and in His presence at the
   altar, and He shall lead you by the path of the sons of God to the
   peace of His kingdom.

   Your way shall be sure; I do not say it shall be smooth. In bringing
   many sons to glory, He hath made the Leader of their salvation, the
   first who trod the path, "perfect through suffering." [10] He may
   ordain this also for you. We know not: God knoweth. But, smooth or
   rough, the way shall be sure; and He will lead you unto the end,
   through all changes of life, through all shadows of the world, through
   struggles and pain, hope and fear, sorrow and the cross, up the
   ascending path, by chastisements and warnings, by sudden visitations
   and lingering cares, by tokens in your home and at the altar, by
   persuasions more moving than words, by pledges more assuring than a
   miracle, until every son shall be conformed to the Son incarnate,
   eternal, "the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every
   creature," [11] in the kingdom of our Father.

SERMON III.

  THE NAME OF JESUS.

  ST. MATT. i. 21.

   "Thou shalt call His name Jesus."

   THESE words were spoken in vision by the angel of God to Joseph. They
   are a part of the divine message which revealed to him the mystery of
   the Incarnation. Strange things were in the thoughts of his heart, but
   stranger still were those made known from heaven. He was himself
   included in the great ministry of divine power and love. Second only to
   Mary, who was chosen to be the Mother of our Lord, is he who was
   elected to be her betrothed husband, and the foster-father of the Son
   of God. "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is
   conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost." What a charge was here
   committed to him--to watch over the Mother and the Son; to be the
   guardian of the Word made flesh. Unto which of the angels gave He at
   any time so great a trust? They ministered to Him; but Joseph was
   invested with a father's sway; he fostered Him in His childhood;
   wrought for Him, nurtured Him, bare Him as a protector and a guide.

   And when the angel had given this great commission, he revealed also
   the Name of the divine Child. "Thou shalt call His name Jesus." The
   Name had been chosen in heaven. It was already known in the heavenly
   court. Angels worshipped it when they adored the Eternal Son Incarnate
   from the foundation of the world.

   Why, it may be asked, was so great care taken to choose and to reveal a
   name? Because names are realities--what they express is no mere sound,
   but a living truth. The Father is the Father, not because He is called
   so, but He is called so because He is the Father. The Son is the Son,
   not because He is called the Son, but He is called so because He is the
   Son. Names stand for persons; and persons are living and true
   realities. This we know even in earthly names; they represent to us
   persons, with all their complex associations of character and feature.
   As persons kindle our affections, and waken our sympathies, so names
   take up the sympathies and affections which cling to persons. When
   present, persons are the objects of our hearts; when absent, names come
   into their place. And names call up the liveliest and fondest memories.
   When we hear them, we see before us forms and countenances, with their
   expression and character; we hear the tones and accents, the laugh and
   footstep of the past. Names are to us what persons are, dear or
   indifferent, moving or powerless, just as they for whom they stand. Who
   does not know what is the power of the name of father or mother, sister
   or brother? What visions they bring back upon us: what a stream of
   memories; of years long passed away, of careless childhood, bright
   mornings, lingering twilights, the early dawn, the evening star, and
   all the long-vanished world of happy, unanxious thoughts, with the
   loves, hopes, smiles, and tenderness of days gone by. Who does not know
   what visions of maturer life come and go with the sound of a name, of
   one familiar word--the symbol of a whole order now no more? The greater
   part of our consciousness is summed up in memory; the present is but a
   moment, ever flowing, past almost as soon as come. Our life is either
   behind us or before; the future in hope and expectation, the past in
   trial and remembrance. Our life to come is little realised as yet; we
   have some dim outlines of things unseen, forecastings of realities
   behind the veil, and objects of faith beyond the grave; but all this is
   too divine and high. We can hardly conceive it; at best faintly, often
   not at all. Our chief consciousness of life is in the past, which yet
   hangs about us as an atmosphere peopled with memories and forms. They
   live for us now in names, beloved and blessed.

   So is it with this Name chosen of God. "Thou shalt call His name
   Jesus." It stands to us as the witness of peace and bliss. What visions
   are called up by it! The Child at Nazareth, or sitting in the temple;
   the Healer of sorrows at the gate of Nain, or weeping by the grave in
   Bethany; the Cleanser of sin; the Lord of compassion, breaking bread in
   the wilderness; the good Shepherd; the Friend of Sinners; the Absolver
   of penitents; the Companion of the lonely, as they walk by the way of
   life and are sad; and now, in the heavenly kingdom, the Redeemer,
   pitiful, loving, compassionate; stooping over us, with a countenance of
   light, meek and patient, divine in tenderness, our Lord and our God.
   All this rises up at the sound of this sacred Name. Let us see why it
   reveals all this to our faith.

   1. First, because the name Jesus is the name Saviour. When Isaiah, in
   the spirit of prophecy, spake of Him, he gave His heavenly titles, His
   divine name. "His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The
   mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." [12] But the
   angel brought to us His earthly title, the human name which He should
   take as the Son of man. "Thou shalt call His name Jesus." And then he
   reveals the reason: "For He shall save His people from their sins."

   It expresses His office as our Saviour. He is our salvation. The whole
   mystery of His person and of His work is revealed in the name Jesus;
   for He first saved our nature by taking if upon Himself. He took to
   Himself our manhood of the substance of our fallen humanity, and made
   it sinless and deathless. In our nature, though without sin, He
   suffered death, that He might save us from sin and death. Therefore He
   is the Saviour both of our nature and of ourselves. And His name is a
   healing name, pledging to us the salvation He has made perfect in His
   own immortal flesh. We may draw from this word the whole baptismal
   faith. It brings before us the Godhead of the Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost; the divine image in which we were created; the abyss into which
   we fell and died. It reveals to us the mystery of the eternal Son made
   Man, suffering and dying for us, His life of contradiction, His death
   of agony. "He is our peace." [13] And His name reveals to us the
   reconciliation of God and man, of things in heaven and things in earth;
   the justification of the faithful, the absolution of sinners, the calm
   of the dying, the rest of saints. What a title is Saviour! dear to each
   one, as he knows the depth of his own fall. If we realise what sin is,
   and death: the eternal weight of guilt, the anguish of defiled hearts,
   the torment of temptation, the judgment to come, the undying worm, the
   everlasting flame, the loss of God; if we know, each one, what our life
   has been in childhood, youth, and manhood,--its sins and sorrows, its
   wounds and sicknesses, its inward darkness and deceit:--and unless we
   know these things, we do but take this Name in vain:--if, indeed, we
   know all this with a living and thrilling heart, then there is no "name
   under heaven given among men" so full of calm and healing. It will be
   to us exactly what we are in ourselves: to the impenitent an empty
   word, to the penitent life and pardon: to any measure of penitence,
   dear as the sorrow is deeper; dearest to those who are self-accused and
   convicted, guilty in their own eyes above all, sorrowing and alone, not
   for want of kind hearts around them, but because the kindest and
   nearest heart is all too far away to soothe the affliction of a
   contrite spirit. One alone can enter into the quick of our grief. One
   alone can heal a wounded heart. One only Name has power to save.

   2. But there is a deeper meaning still. The name Jesus is His name as
   our kinsman. It is His name as man--the name of His humiliation, given
   on the eighth day, when, for our sakes, He humbled Himself. He is very
   Man, in all the truth of our humanity. He took our true manhood--not of
   a like substance with us, but of the same; the one substance of
   mankind. By regeneration, we are "of His flesh and of His bone," who by
   incarnation is of ours. He entered into human relations. He shared our
   kindred, and placed Himself in the order of our consanguinity. The
   Spirit of prophecy, speaking in the person of the Church, cried of old,
   "Oh, that Thou wert as my brother." [14] And this desire He has
   granted. He is made our brother: "He is not ashamed to call us
   brethren." "Go to My brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto My
   Father and your Father." [15] He has, therefore, taken upon Him all the
   affections of kindred. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
   least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me." [16] As He is the
   faultless and perfect Son, so He is the loving and perfect Brother, As
   human nature has its perfection in His person, so human kindred has its
   perfection in His heart. His love, tenderness, and sympathy as a
   Brother, are as perfect as His patience, lowliness, and sanctity as
   Man. The name Jesus is the name of a brother in blood, who thereby
   binds Himself to us with the natural bonds which unite us to each
   other. It pledges to us His sympathy in all sorrows of body and of
   soul,--in poverty and straits, in weariness and fasting, in fear and
   anxiety, in temptation and desertion: all these He shares with us, by
   the perfect sympathy and perfect affection of a brother. Let us dwell
   upon this thought, as it is revealed to us in the mystery of the
   Incarnation.

   There are two spheres of being; the uncreated, where from everlasting
   the eternal Son dwelt with the Father and the Holy Ghost; and the
   created, into which, by His incarnation, He came down to dwell with us.
   In the higher sphere, He still received the adoration of the heavenly
   court as God, while, in the lower, angels ministered to Him as man. And
   now, exalted in our manhood to His Father's throne, the Lord Jesus,
   very Man as very God, receives the homage of all worlds, while, as our
   brother, He is united still with us. Here is the line at which the
   faith of many fails. They believe His Godhead, and profess to believe
   His manhood; but they shrink from the divine mysteries of our living
   incorporation with His perfect humanity, our very and true
   participation in His divine nature. Therefore, to them, sacraments are
   figures of an intellectual food; the Church and union springing from
   our individual will; the sympathy of Christ a fancy, or even an
   irreverent approach. And for the same cause they cannot understand the
   blessed reality of His human affections, of His heart as man. They
   shrink from it, as something presumptuous, or enthusiastic; or as
   lowering, and, as they say, humanising the spiritual and divine. What,
   then, would they have said of the Incarnation itself, if they had not
   unconsciously received it before they began to judge as a condition to
   believing? The mystery of the Incarnation is, indeed, a humanising of
   God, as it is also a deifying of man; for in Him the Godhead and the
   manhood are alike perfect and indivisible. The name Jesus speaks to us
   through His human heart, like ours in all things, sin only excepted.

   3. But there is, if possible, a still deeper and more precious meaning
   of this name. "There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother."
   [17] When He was on earth, He had, if I may speak after our common way,
   His particular friendships. Beside the kindred of blood which He
   contracted with all, there is a spiritual kindred, which is even nearer
   still. "Who is My mother, and who are My brethren? Whosoever shall do
   the will of My Father in heaven, the same is My brother, and sister,
   and mother." "He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is
   that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and
   I will love him." [18] He has told us on what this special love is
   founded. It rested on the zeal of Peter, the ardent love of John, the
   diligent service of Martha, the yearning devotion of Mary; and yet
   their love was but the reflection of the love He first bare to
   them--the faint return of that love wherewith He had loved them
   eternally. Nevertheless, we here may learn a great law of His kingdom,
   that He has particular friendships, and a special love for those who
   love and live for Him. To them this Name is a depth of sweetness, as
   the harmonies of a perfect strain. It is "sweeter than honey and the
   honeycomb." It sheds abroad in them a consciousness of heavenly love.
   It has been to them as a hymn of praise, a prayer of power, a litany of
   pleading, a meditation all the day long. "My meditation of Him shall be
   sweet." This has been the musing of saints. Their words and their
   writings, their acts and their prayers, their public labours and their
   solitary hours, their lives and their deaths, have been full of it.
   Preachers have taken it as their text. The name of Jesus, said one of
   old, "is honey in the mouth, melody in the ear, gladness in the heart,
   medicine to the soul. Is any of you sad, let Jesus come into his heart,
   and thence pass into his lips. No sooner is the light of this name
   arisen, than all clouds fly before it, and the calm sky returns." "When
   I speak the name Jesus,' I set before me a man meek and lowly of heart,
   benign and modest, pure and pitiful, bright with all goodness and
   holiness; and He is, moreover, God the Almighty, Who heals me by His
   example, and strengthens me by His help." [19] The Church has made
   hymns of this one sacred word. "Jesu, sweet in memory, Giver of joy to
   the heart; sweet above the honeycomb, sweeter than all, is Thy
   Presence. No song so soft, no tidings so glad, no thought so grateful,
   as Jesus the Son of God. Jesu, Hope of penitents, how gentle to those
   who plead with Thee! how good to those who seek! But what to those who
   find Thee?"

   What, if we dare to speak of it, was the name of such a Son to His
   blessed Mother; what a name of love ineffable, of adoring fond delight!
   What was the memory of that name, in after years, to her whom He had
   forgiven sevenfold; what in long years of loneliness to St. John; what
   to St. Peter in the sharpness of the cross? What has it been, what is
   it not, to all solitary and saintly hearts, for whom this world has no
   solace, this life nothing that they should any more desire it?

   And what is this name to us? When we hear it, what does it awaken? When
   we read it, what does it kindle in our hearts? Does it call up a vision
   of beauty and of majesty; a Presence awful with divine glory, radiant
   with a countenance of love? Does it make our hearts to burn with a
   memory of His meekness and tenderness, His afflictions and His passion?
   Does it thrill through them with a consciousness that for us He was all
   this, and He suffered all this, and that He is all this to us still?

   No other word can declare at once, what we have been to Him, and what
   He has been to us.

   We have been to Him all that sinners can: we dethroned Him from our
   hearts, and from the kingdom of His Father; we girded Him with our
   fallen manhood; we laid on Him the necessity of sorrow; we bound Him by
   the law of death; we pierced Him upon the cross; we have been to Him as
   the ungrateful lepers, cleansed and thankless; we have slighted and
   forgotten Him all the day long. "Out of sight, out of mind." We have
   lived as if He had never suffered and died; as if He had never been, as
   if He were a fabulous person, an abstraction, a name standing for a
   theory or an intellectual scheme.

   And what has He not been to us? From our childhood to this hour; in the
   days of our sinful blindness, and in the years of our more sinful
   contempt of light; in our sinning and repenting, our returning and
   relapsing; all the while He has been to us forgiving, patient, tender,
   full of pity, full of peace, our Saviour, kinsman, and friend. He loved
   us even in our falls, and accepts our love even after so great
   ingratitude. Let each one look into himself. What has He been to you in
   times of sickness, and what have you been to Him in your time of
   health? Has not His countenance shone upon you in the darkness of
   sorrow, bereavement, and solitude; and has not your face been turned
   away from Him when the light came back into your home again? Have you
   not learned by trial, and almost by sense, that all the visions and
   parables of mercy revealed in the earthly life of the Lord Jesus are
   perpetual miracles of grace, perpetual ministries of consolation? Does
   He not now as then--has He not always until now received sinners, bound
   up broken hearts, cleansed the contrite, consoled mourners, upheld the
   sinking, visited the path of the lonely, the hiding-place of sorrow,
   the pains of sickness, the pallet of the dying? Have you not so known
   Him nigh to you in your home and heart?

   Let us, then, desire and pray that we may love His person. Let us not
   think, or fancy, or dream about loving Him, but love Him "in deed and
   in truth." To love Him is not an act of the intellect, but an affection
   of the heart. It is to be attained, not by a vivid imagination, but by
   a fervent will. If we would love Him, we must ask of Him to make us
   feel His love. It is love that awakens love. In the measure in which we
   feel the glow and sunshine of His love resting upon us, we shall kindle
   and break forth into love to Him again. As we learn to know our guilt
   and sinfulness, our sloth and perversity, our churlish and ungrateful
   hearts; as we come to see the coldness, weariness, estrangement of our
   souls, even in our prayers before Him, nay, above all, at the very
   altar; and, feeling all this, as we taste His forgiveness and
   compassion, His tenderness and pity, then we shall know the sweetness
   of this sacred Name. It will be to us the pledge of all He is. "Thy
   name is as ointment poured forth;" all the day long we shall remember
   it: abroad and at home it will be with us, and "the whole house shall
   be filled with the odour of the ointment."

   For this let us strive always to realise His Presence. O slow of heart;
   we speak of Him as of one come and gone, as of a wayfarer who once
   tarried for a night, long ago past in the dimness of history; or we
   think of Him as of one whom we shall some day see, with whom we shall
   then begin to make account. How few live upon His promise, "Lo, I am
   with you alway;" and the blessedness of the relation, that He is our
   Master, and we His servants; He our Lord, and we His disciples. "They
   have taken away my Lord out of the sepulchre, and I know not where they
   have laid Him." What love and sorrow is in that one word, "my Lord!" Is
   He not so to each of us? May not each one of us say, "My Lord and my
   God?" What a strength and spring of life, what hope and trust, what
   glad, unresting energy, is in this one thought,--to serve Him who is
   "my Lord" ever near me, ever looking on; seeing my intentions before He
   beholds my failures; knowing my desires before He sees my faults;
   cheering me to endeavour greater things, and yet accepting the least;
   inviting my poor service, and yet, above all, content with my poorer
   love. Let us try to bear this in mind, whatsoever, wheresoever we be.
   The humblest and the simplest, the weakest and the most encumbered, may
   love Him not less than the busiest and strongest, the most gifted and
   laborious. If our heart be clear before Him; if He be to us our chief
   and sovereign choice, dear above all, and beyond all desired; then all
   else matters little. That which concerneth us He will perfect in
   stillness and in power, and His name will be our solace and strength,
   the beginning of every work, the end of every desire, our motive and
   our hope, our meditation and our confidence. The Name of Jesus will be
   our all: what it speaks, He is. It shall be perseverance in life, and
   peace in death; an absolving plea in the day of His coming, a song of
   joy in the kingdom of the Resurrection. It is even now the chant of
   saints, the hallelujah of angels; for God hath given Him "a name which
   is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
   of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
   and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
   glory of God the Father." [20]

SERMON IV.

  CHRIST PREACHED IN ANY WAY A CAUSE OF JOY.

    PHIL. i. 18.

   "What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in
   truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
   rejoice."

   THE great Head of the Church has two chief ways of spreading the
   knowledge of the faith--the preaching of His pastors, and the
   contradiction of the world. And this seems to be the plain meaning of
   St. Paul. Some preached Christ out of envy of the Apostles, and in
   strife against them; in "contention" and contradiction, or by pretended
   and rival commission from Christ Himself. These were gainsayers. Others
   preached "of good will" and in truth, as His true pastors and their
   brethren. Both were united in one work, that is, in making Christ's
   name rise more loudly above the din and turmoil of the world. The truth
   of the Gospel was heard in articulate and thrilling tones through all
   the noise and uproar of Home. The enemies of the Gospel helped to fill
   the forum, the circus, and the palace of the Caesars with the unwelcome
   "tidings of good." And in all this the Apostle rejoiced. In his bonds,
   and in the deep prison underneath the rock, his heart beat gladly at
   the thought that even enemies were preachers of Christ's name, and that
   gainsayers were evangelists.

   Such is the manifold wisdom of God. "Surely," when the enmity of man
   preaches the cross of Christ, "the wrath of man shall praise Thee." The
   wise and the incredulous, the scorner and the fearful, the envious and
   the contentious, were all one in persecuting the holy Name; but He that
   sitteth in heaven laughed them to scorn. He poured upon them, as it
   were, the spirit of prophecy, and made them publish abroad the Name
   they were striving to destroy.

   We see here a great law of Christ's providence over His Church. He
   furthers His own ends, not by affirmations only, but by negations; by
   faith and by unbelief, by truth and by heresy, by unity and by schism.
   It is a transcendent and intricate mystery, far beyond our
   intelligence. All things conspire to His purpose, and His will ruleth
   over all; not, it may be, to the purpose we imagine for Him, nor to our
   idea of His will, but to His own, not as yet revealed. These are
   thoughts very full of comfort in the present state of the Church on
   earth.

   Besides the contention and strife of which St. Paul speaks, we have now
   a trial of a more perplexing kind. I mean, the multiplication of
   Christian sects, shading off almost into agreement with the Catholic
   faith; and, more than all, division and opposition in the Church
   itself. What, then, may we believe, would St. Paul have said at the
   sight of Christendom as we see it now? Would he have said,
   "Notwithstanding, every way Christ is preached; and I therein do
   rejoice, yea, and will rejoice?" Certainly he would have rebuked us,
   "even weeping," for our heresies and schisms, for our bitter and
   irreconcilable tempers. He would have even desired to be anathema,
   "accursed from Christ," [21] that the East and the West might again be
   one, and the West united in itself. He would have been "ready to spend
   and be spent," that all sects which have issued from the Church might
   be brought home again to its altars, and only enemies of the cross of
   Christ cast out. He would have condemned all separations, sects, and
   schisms, with a keen and indignant sorrow. But the question comes back
   again, Would he still have rejoiced that, though perfect unity in truth
   and love were impossible, yet "every way Christ is preached?" Would the
   publication of truth even in contention, strife, rivalry, and pretence,
   have given him cause of joy? Would he have said, "Kather so, than not
   at all: let Christ's Name be gainsayed, rather than buried in silence?"
   I think he would.

   1. Because the name of Christ reveals the love of God. The mere
   knowledge that "God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life;" [22] the mere publication and proclaiming of this
   great fact, without Church or sacraments, without creeds or Scriptures,
   is a supernatural gift of truth revealing the love of God. And this is
   an inestimable advance beyond the state of man without this knowledge.

   How little do we lay to heart the love of God for the world which He
   has made! His love is the element in which it hangs and moves on its
   unerring path. The world itself, as His creation, the work of His
   hands, is an object of divine transcendent love. God hates sin, but
   nothing that He has made. To bear the print of His hand is to bear the
   impress of His love. All the effluence of His presence and power upon
   the world before sin came was love. And since the fall, all His
   government and working among mankind has been the expression of His
   love. Even His sorest visitations, and the strokes of His anger, have
   been in love for man. He would have no life perish, but live for ever.
   He willed not that the heathen should perish. When He gave them up, it
   was because they first had given Him up. [23] No soul that ever sought
   to Him, or held by Him, was ever cast away. Doubtless, among the
   darkest people of the earth, He had servants and witnesses, yea, seers
   and prophets. In the midst of an idolatrous people, Enoch walked with
   God. Noah preached a hundred and twenty years. Job was a seer among the
   Midianites, and his friends had the knowledge of God. Abraham was
   called out of a people who worshipped idols "on the other side the
   flood." [24] Melchisedech was priest of the Most High God in Salem.
   Visions were sent of God to Abimelech king of Gerar, [25] and to
   Pharaoh king of Egypt. [26] Jethro was priest of Midian, [27] and a
   counsellor of Moses. Balaam was a prophet in the far East. Jonah
   preached repentance in Nineveh. Visions and voices were revealed to the
   kings of Babylon. [28] The Gentile world was full of tokens of the
   Divine power and Godhead, love and goodness: proselytes came forth from
   it out of Ethiopia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and all regions of the earth,
   into the courts of Jerusalem; and at the coming of the Name of Christ,
   it was instinct with the first motions of a higher life. Everywhere the
   Apostles found souls "that were ordained," that is, disposed, "to
   eternal life." [29] What do all these revealed testimonies prove, but
   that God has an election in nature as well as in grace; that His tender
   love has been working by inscrutable ways from the beginning, "reaching
   mightily from end to end, and sweetly disposing all things;" that He
   has mercy for all the creatures of His hand? What more do we need to
   prove that "God would have all men to be saved, and to come to the
   knowledge of the truth;" [30] that Jesus Christ is "the Saviour of all
   men, specially of them that believe?" [31] These divine facts reveal
   the will and desire of God to be infinite mercy and universal love.

   If this be the condition of the heathen without the knowledge of
   revelation, either Law or Gospel, it is plain that every access of
   light is an approach to God. Simply to know that "God so loved the
   world as to give His Son" for it, is a revelation like the splendour of
   the rising sun. The mercy which the heathen desired and hoped, this
   declared and proved. And as it wrought an entire change in their
   knowledge and conceptions of God, it must also have wrought as great a
   change in the affections with which they regarded Him. God was to them
   no longer an object only of thrilling fear, or of pale dubious hope,
   but of trust, thankfulness, and love. Their whole inward life would
   undergo a mitigation, and be mellowed to a more filial temper; and in
   their measure, they would be raised above their former state to a
   relation of hope and obedience, of purity and worship.

   I have stated this at length, because it will help to set before us the
   condition of those Christians who, knowing little more than that Christ
   came to save the world, are indeed immeasurably below the blessed state
   of the regenerate in the Church of Christ, but immeasurably above the
   highest state vouchsafed to the heathen. If, then, the condition of
   these was an object of God's love and pity, and if the least rays of
   Christian light lifted them so high, what may we not hope for those
   poor souls, robbed of their birthright through* no fault of their own,
   to whom, through envy and strife, a mutilated faith, bearing little
   more than the name of Christ, is preached? Sad and impoverished, and
   yet not utterly robbed of all: they have the name of Christ, the
   revelation of God's love, the knowledge of a Father in heaven; and
   these great truths are great spiritual powers, which work mysterious
   and mighty changes in the soul; changes which draw them as unconscious
   proselytes to the courts of the unseen temple, and order the
   dispositions of their spiritual life according to the law of love.

   Surely in this the Apostle would have bid us rejoice in his joy.
   Imperfect and maimed, yet it is the living and life-giving truth. It
   both has life and gives life. Better to have this than to abide in the
   shadow of death. Any light is better than darkness, any food than
   famine: even crumbs of the "Bread which came down from heaven," than
   the husks of this fallen earth.

   Thus far we have taken it on the lowest ground, supposing that the
   least measure of truth is preached. Yet even in this least measure
   there is cause for joy; for thereby the love of God in Christ is
   declared. And at this we may rejoice, leaving to Him to measure and to
   gather in what fruit He will.

   If this be true of the least measure of Christian truth, how much must
   the force of the argument rise with every increase in that measure. As
   knowledge rises towards the perfect faith, every such advance is so
   much more of union between the spirit of man and the character and will
   of God. I am now speaking of knowledge only as a means of illumination
   and obedience, not as imposing the responsibility of attaining the
   perfect truth. It is enough, for the present, to consider truth as
   being in itself, and by the virtue of its own nature, a means of
   conversion to God. Every light which reveals God's love leads on
   towards conversion. How much more, then, will this appear as we advance
   into the fuller teaching of Christian doctrine among the less erroneous
   of sectarian bodies, or in the Nestorian and Eutychian Churches of the
   East. Among these are taught and believed the love and passion of our
   Lord, the presence and gifts of the Spirit, the mystery of the
   ever-blessed Trinity. Imperfect and darkened as all these doctrines
   must be when rent from the unity and charity of the Church, yet they do
   so far bring the spiritual nature of man under the dominion of truth
   and the powers of the world to come. Taken at the lowest, this must
   surely be joy to all who desire to see God enthroned in His own world.
   If only it be that pagan rites and philosophical schools have consumed
   away, or have been transformed into Christian sects and Christian
   philosophies--that is, even if there were no faith, but only reason; no
   spirit of sanctity, but only a higher moral law; even so it would be a
   blessed and joyful sight,--a bright softened twilight issuing from the
   illumination of the Church, and a ripening, it may be, of mankind for
   the reception of the full powers of faith. Let us not, like
   freethinkers, stumble at the mystery that the Church is not universal.
   All God's dealings are progressive; and all progressive dispensations
   have to our eyes an imperfect outline and discordant preludes, and a
   circumference or halo of indistinct and, as it were, of morning or
   evening light. Such is the Christianity which surrounds the Church.

   2. Let us take another reason for rejoicing. The preaching of Christ,
   even in the most imperfect form, is a witness against the sin of the
   world. And what are these two great truths, the love of God and the sin
   of the world, but the two poles on which all our salvation turns? The
   mere sound of the name of Saviour, Redeemer, Ransom, and Sacrifice, is
   a testimony against the natural conscience. And so we actually find.
   Perhaps there is nothing more prominent among certain Christian sects
   than exaggerated theories of sin. So far the most imperfect teaching,
   by encountering sin in the conscience, prepares the way for the true
   faith; consciousness of sin being a perception of the spiritual nature,
   and a condition to divine faith. In this sense, then, all promulgations
   of Christ are forerunners of the truth. They work round about the
   suburbs of the city of God, spreading indistinct rumours of revelations
   yet to come. And besides this, there is a direct inward work wrought in
   the hearts of individuals, convincing them deeply of their need of
   something divine. The knowledge of God's love and of Christ's passion
   works mightily in softening or breaking the hearts of men, be they who
   they may. Alas, it is too true that thousands in the visible Church
   shew less love and less compunction than many who are in separation
   from the unity of the body of Christ. The powers of truth are not
   bound. They, like the presence of God and the nature of man, are
   universal. Wheresoever they alight, as seeds wafted by the winds, or by
   the sweep of tides, or by the flight of birds, though not sown in
   order, nor by the ministry of man, they germinate. Truth is a living
   and energetic principle, "quick and powerful;" like the ministering
   spirits, it is as a flame of fire. Though its home and rest be the
   Church of Christ, yet wheresoever it goes abroad, it lightens and
   penetrates, kindles and quickens with life. And therefore we see among
   those who are separate from the Church multitudes deeply convinced of
   personal sinfulness, yearning for some shelter and refuge, finding none
   visible except the Church alone, of which, their eyes being holden by
   invincible error, they cannot discern the true character and office.
   They are therefore forced to conceive to themselves an invisible
   Church: a pleasing illusion, most accordant with their state, and
   consoling to their conscious perplexities. But be their intellectual
   theology what it may, there can be no doubt that among them are to be
   found true and fervent penitents, who shall rise up in judgment with
   the visible Church, and shall condemn thousands. Certainly, then, we
   must rejoice that for such fruits as these Christ is preached. If the
   truth cannot be preached in its unity, then let us hope that it will
   tell by its own sanctity and force, even in the midst of division. If
   they will not have all their birthright, let them not be deprived of
   any fragment they are willing to receive from the fulness of their
   heavenly inheritance.

   3. And to take one more reason. The preaching of Christ brings men
   under the law of responsibility. It reveals the four last
   things,--death, judgment, hell, and heaven; it testifies to the
   commandments of God, the law of charity, and the need of holiness. And
   all these things, addressed to the conscience in man, produce their own
   response of fear, hope, obedience. Considered only as a moral code, the
   Gospel is the most perfect rule that mankind has ever received. If it
   were only promulgated by a human legislature and enforced by a human
   executive, it would produce a state of social peace and personal purity
   higher than the science of politics had ever ventured to conceive. This
   is the basis of modern civilisation. Christianity has raised and
   ripened the whole theory and practice of government and jurisprudence;
   without making it religious, it has exalted it above the refinement of
   Athenian liberty and the sternness of Roman justice. A Christian nation
   means a people professing Christianity; but, as we see, there may be
   Christian nations partly, or even wholly, rent away from the unity of
   the Church of Christ. Still they retain their Christian
   character,--justice, temperance, order, benevolence, mercifulness, and
   the like. And yet all these are not the sanctity which is a note of the
   Church. They are the fruits of human responsibility, trained under a
   high moral discipline, and scrupulously directed in the fulfilment of
   the second table of the law,--the duty we owe to our neighbour. No one
   can look at such a people without a thankful sense of the goodness of
   God, in giving truth, not only as an object of faith, but as a rule of
   moral discipline; so that even where it is lightly regarded as the path
   to eternal life, it is still cherished as a law of order for this
   earthly state. What is the ripe civilisation, the fair peace and
   harmonious friendship of states and kingdoms, the alliances and
   relations of national systems, the temperate sway of princes, the
   liberty of subject people, the purity of domestic obedience, but a
   second crop of fruits shaken from the faith of Christ, as from a
   fig-tree in its later season? Even though nations still linger outside
   the vineyard, shall we not rejoice over such a fruitage as this? Though
   they refuse the whole truth, is it not a joy that even so much as this
   should be received, and with such returns? Surely every one who wishes
   well to mankind must rejoice. All that can be done to foster and ripen
   the elements of truth, to "strengthen the things that remain which are
   ready to die," is the duty and work of charity. To overthrow, on the
   plea of re-construction, is to do the office of one whose name is the
   Destroyer. God's temple is to be built up by a labour of construction
   which preserves with jealous and loving tenderness all that has life
   and truth. If only we would recognise this great law of the divine
   economy, full of wisdom and of love; if only we would strive to "edify
   one another," to add to and raise upward to perfection whatsoever of
   truth and faith exists in the most imperfect, we should win many a
   soul. Men are not won by contradictions, nor persuaded by refutations,
   but by the expansion, enlargement, and perfect exhibition of the truths
   they hold in germ. This is the divine rule of controversy, the only
   evangelical principle of conversion, the law of unity, truth, and love.
   Wheresoever, then, the germs of the perfect faith are sown, therein let
   us rejoice in hope.

   What has here been said manifestly lies open to a multitude of apparent
   objections, and some of the highest and gravest kind. It may be said
   that this is equivalent to denying the visibleness and the divine
   institution of the Church, the necessity and grace of the holy
   sacraments; that it substitutes personal sincerity for the true faith,
   and goes all length with the latitudinarian theory, which either makes
   truth indifferent, or God all mercy.

   I say, these are apparent objections; for not one of them, as we shall
   see, really has any force.

   All that has been said rests upon two undeniable truths.

   1. First, that all truth has life in it to those whose heart is right
   with God. This is an axiom so absolute and clear that we need not fear
   to affirm it without limitation. Perhaps it may be said, "What, then,
   is this but the latitudinarian fiction, so long ago familiar in rhyme,
   which says that bigots only care for points of faith; that God looks to
   our life alone; and that, where this is right, we cannot, for the world
   to come, be wrong?" This saying, false as it is in its rhetorical
   aspect, is, with one comment, strictly true in its logical force. If
   right and wrong are predicated of the faith or doctrine of an imperfect
   believer, it is a contradiction in terms. But if they be predicated of
   his own life and moral state before God, it is an axiomatic truth. No
   man's life can be wrong before God, if it is right before God. The
   saying, then, is a mere paradox, a rebuke not undeserved by rigorists,
   who, while they cannot stand too stiffly for truth, may easily be too
   blind to the fruits of God's good Spirit. Why should we have any fear
   at all of adopting the whole proverb? Let no Christian fight, but
   suffer for the faith: and let us rejoice that no man can be wrong in
   his obedience, who, so far as his light goes in that obedience, is
   right. Nay, we may carry this much more boldly onward, and with the
   whole Catholic Church affirm, that no ignorance of truth is a personal
   sin before God, except that ignorance which springs from personal sin.
   The measures of truth possessed by, or presented to, individuals are so
   extensively determined by external states and circumstances over which
   they have no control, that multitudes never are brought face to face
   with the full orb of faith. Birth, nation, religious community,
   education or the want of education, faithfulness or unfaithfulness in
   parents and pastors, changes and contingencies of life, and the whole
   world of intricate and inconceivable agencies which mould and dispose
   the lot of individuals,--all these determine with infinite variety the
   measures of truth proposed to each. And we know that, "if there be
   first a willing mind, a man is accepted according to that he hath, not
   according to that he hath not." [32] And how shall they believe in that
   of which they have not heard?

   Now this also opens a further and inner fold of this deep subject.
   Blameless ignorance does not arise only from the want of having truth
   actually proposed from without. The intellectual and spiritual
   perceptions within are so deeply formed and controlled by agencies
   under which we are passive, and for which we are, therefore, not
   responsible, that there may be an ignorance wholly without personal sin
   even in the presence of the full faith of Christ. Such is the state of
   unknown multitudes, who have been trained from childhood to regard
   certain errors with religious love, and certain truths with religious
   fear. These affections of the soul, matured in them by others, become
   almost instincts, and take their place beside the clearest dictates of
   conscience. Such persons have often no intellectual gifts to rise above
   their teachers, still less any powers and faculties to analyse and
   unravel the texture of their religious perceptions. As they have been
   taught, so they believe. Filial love, dutiful submission, habitual
   reverence, humble self-mistrust, fear of wandering in religion and of
   illusion in eternal realities, consciousness of past mercies and still
   more of present blessings,--all these make them hold with the full
   power of reverence, affection, trust, persuasion, and religious
   perseverance to the teaching of their home and childhood. This is what
   theologians call prejudice' in its pure etymological sense a judgment
   foregone, formed for us by others or by events; and this prejudice has
   always been held to excuse the error; and the ignorance founded upon it
   is to be counted invincible, and therefore no personal sin. Can we
   doubt that this great rule of compassion applies to the wide-spread and
   numerous branches of the Oriental Church, which for fourteen hundred
   years have lived and died in the Nestorian heresy? What but this has
   been the condition of children, women, poor and uninstructed souls, in
   the forty generations which have passed since that great schism? And
   does not the same principle apply to every Christian sect according to
   its measure, and to every individual born into it? And lastly, shall we
   not all, on all sides, have need to shelter ourselves under this law of
   tender and pitiful compassion at that great day when the members of
   Christ's Church, now miserably torn asunder, shall stand in the light
   where all truth is seen without a shadow?

   Truth is given for the probation of man; the probation of man is not
   ordained for the sake of truth. God can prove, and from the beginning
   has proved, His servants in every measure of light, from the noon of
   night to the noon of day. We have the warrant of holy writ, that the
   Gentiles, who had received no revealed law, did "by nature the things
   contained in the law," being "a law unto themselves;" [33] and that by
   their law they should be judged. When St. Peter said, "God is no
   respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth Him and doeth
   righteousness is accepted of Him;" [34] it is true that he spoke, with
   design, only of the admission of Gentiles to the grace given to the
   Jews; but he enunciated a much larger application of God's law of
   grace. He denied that national distinctions were a bar to mercy, but he
   affirmed also that fear and righteousness are universally accepted of
   God. He thereby enunciated the great axioms of the kingdom of mercy,
   that no obedient soul can perish, no penitent be cast away, no soul
   that loves God be lost. If the heart be right with God, He will weigh
   the rest in a balance of compassion. Now, we have already seen that
   even an imperfect preaching of the name of Christ tends to promulgate
   the great law of responsibility, the knowledge of sin, and the
   revelation of God's love; and imperfect though such preaching be, yet
   having this tendency, who will dare not to rejoice? "Would God that all
   the Lord's people were prophets; and that the Lord would put His spirit
   upon them;" [35] that there might be no envy or strife, no clash or
   contradiction, no rivalry or variance, no schism or heresy, but "one
   body and one spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
   Father." [36] This not being so, it being the permission of the Head of
   the Church that His passion should, as it were, be continued still on
   earth; that He should still hang upon the cross in a confused and
   contradicting world; let us be glad that His Name is preached, not only
   in His Church, but that even they who will not submit to its blessed
   law of unity, yet make our King and His kingdom known abroad.
   Wheresoever these truths fall, like the shadow of an apostle, they bear
   a healing witness of a world unseen, of a law of holiness, of a
   judgment to come. They bring the conscience and the will of men into
   relation with the Presence and will of God. Like sparks scattered from
   a light, each one contains the whole power of fire. Where it falls, it
   kindles; where it kindles, it burns on, hidden it may be and pent up,
   but, because pent up, intense. No eye but God's can read the mysteries
   which are received by implicit faith. We cannot tell what may be the
   clear spiritual perceptions of the darkest and most torpid intellect.
   Whatsoever, then, be the anxious fears with which we may look on--much
   more indeed for ourselves who have the fuller light than for those who
   have the less--to the great day when the Lord shall take a measured
   account of His servants, let us always rejoice that, where more perfect
   knowledge of Christ and of His kingdom cannot be had, "notwithstanding,
   every way Christ is preached," leaving the rest to Him.

   2. The other truth to which I referred is this: that though all truth
   has life in it, yet the duty of believing the whole and perfect truth
   is still absolutely binding on pain of sin to all who know it. This at
   once lays the axe to the root of latitudinarian theories. It guards the
   compassion of God upon the sincerely ignorant as with a sword of fire.
   It is with the faith as it is with the light of heaven. After that God
   had said, "Let there be light, and there was light," He gathered it
   into an orb of brightness with a full and visible disc, and set it in
   the heavens. The light of the sun pours down its floods upon all the
   earth,--here with its direct and fullest splendour, and there by
   reflection of its rays; in some places it is noon, in others twilight;
   even in the day there are lights and shadows, and yet there is light
   enough for the works of men and for the service of God. So with the
   faith which He has set in the firmament of the Church. Within the
   sphere of its direct illumination it is full and cloudless, but far and
   near its lights fall obliquely; shedding lingering gleams, or refracted
   rays; guides, even in shade, to searching eyes and willing hearts, if
   right with God according to the measure of their light. But the sun's
   full orb shines out broad and unveiled in the horizon of the new
   creation. The Catholic Church, one, holy, apostolic, and the one faith
   once delivered to the Saints, are, to all who know them as such, the
   absolute and universal conditions of salvation revealed by God in
   Christ. When it is said, then, that no obedient or penitent man can
   perish, and no soul that loves God can be lost, it is because
   obedience, repentance, and love, are the great spiritual realities, to
   create and perfect which the Church was ordained. These realities of
   the Spirit are eternal; prophecies and mysteries are of time. The union
   of the soul with God is the supernatural end to which all sacraments
   are transient means. The atonement is infinite in price; the visible
   Church a finite and earthly mystery. God has bound us to seek His grace
   through His Church; hut He has not bound Himself to give grace and
   salvation in no other way. His mercy is boundless, His Spirit infinite,
   His love as the great deep, His grace always overflowing. God be
   praised that the fountain of living waters, which makes glad the city
   of God, penetrates beneath the soil, and breaks up in secret springs,
   making pools in the wilderness. Is our eye evil because He is good? Did
   we not agree with Him? Shall we not take that which is ours because He
   may do what He wills with His own? What wantonness would this be.
   Whatsoever in His lovingkindness He may do out of His fold, "what is
   that to thee? follow thou Me." And if He raise up saints in Midian or
   Samaria, or send prophets to Horeb, or seers to Jezreel; where is our
   charity, that we would again tie the Hands that were pierced, by the
   bonds of our theology? God forbid; though His overflow of grace water
   the whole earth around the camp of the Saints, how can we but rejoice,
   even as they when they saw that "unto the Gentiles also" He had
   "granted repentance unto life?" Is it not enough for us to have the
   portion of the elder brother? "Son, thou art ever with me, and all that
   I have is thine."

   The force of truth working out of the Church, and the obligation of
   truth propounded by the Church, are two agencies and two principles,
   involving two obligations altogether distinct. Truth working out of the
   Church speaks by its own harmony to the reason; but propounded by the
   Church, it speaks also by the authority of God to the grace of divine
   faith. On us all revealed truth is binding. In one sense there is no
   greater or less among truths, for all are true, and all come from God.
   As with the law, so with the faith: he that shall keep the whole faith,
   and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all. One authority runs
   through all and is in all--the authority of God. All truths, indeed,
   are not in one sense alike; for instance, the articles of the Creed and
   the history of the Apostles; but all are true, and divine faith
   receives all. To reject any is to offend against the revelation of the
   Holy Spirit. And this includes the whole divine order of the Church.
   Our Lord, when He sent the Apostles to baptise and make disciples, bade
   them teach men to observe all things whatsoever He had commanded them.
   The apostolic mission, therefore, had in it not only doctrines but
   sacraments, rules, and institutions; that is, it was a faith, worship,
   ritual, polity, government,--a visible kingdom, having order, power,
   and unity. In all and through all, as one inseparable whole, the Divine
   authority dwells and rules. Truth, therefore, in the Church is one,
   perfect, absolute, and binding; admitting no diminution or addition,
   election or choice. It is all contained in the baptismal creed, as is
   all the law of sanctity in the ten commandments, not expressly, but by
   deep implication; and the authority on which we receive both is
   one,--the Church teaching in the name of Christ. Be it once clear that
   so Christ has spoken in His Church, as well in the least as in the
   greatest we are bound. If He had made the washing of each other's feet
   a perpetual sacrament of humility, as He made the holy eucharist a
   perpetual sacrament of love, we should have been bound.

   This, then, is the great antagonist of latitudinarian errors and proud
   indifference: not to weigh the value of truth in the balance of the
   individual reason, but to call upon the individual will to surrender
   itself to the sweet yoke of Christ. The name of Christ works, indeed,
   in might and in mercy among those who are separate from His fold; but
   they know little of the interior life of His Church who can see no
   tokens of difference even in kind. When has the Sermon on the Mount
   been seen living and full, even to its very letter, except in the unity
   of the Church? Where has the wonderful harmony of diverse and almost
   conflicting spirits of love and power, of softness and fire, of force
   and meekness, of lowliness and inflexibility, been ever seen but in the
   interior fellowship which adore Him present before the altar? There are
   two things which are never apart, perfect sanctity and perfect unity;
   and these are as the two witnesses of God which stand beside "the truth
   as it is in Jesus."

SERMON V.

  CHRIST'S GOING AWAY OUR GAIN.

    ST. JOHN xvi. 7.

   "It is expedient for you that I go away."

   THESE words were spoken in the upper chamber on the night of our Lord's
   betrayal He had celebrated the last Passover of the Old Testament, and
   had instituted the true Paschal Sacrifice of the New. Shadows had now
   passed into realities. The Incarnation of the Son of God had changed an
   earthly type into a heavenly substance. The true Lamb was now taken up
   for the sacrifice, and the true atonement was at hand. He therefore
   began to prepare them for His departure, knowing that His hour was
   come. In a little while they should see Him no more. Three days of
   sorrow, forty days of wondering joy, and then He should depart unto the
   Father.

   For this cause He began to speak to them of a Comforter. Why, they
   hardly knew. A shadow had fallen upon them; but whence they saw not.
   They felt that sorrow was near; but they did not as yet understand His
   words. He then, as knowing their weakness, before He revealed their
   approaching loss, led them to thoughts of consolation. He used the
   manner and the tone of one who had to break some heavy tidings. He was
   slow in His words; throwing out hints, suggesting thoughts of solace,
   before He unfolded the inevitable truth. "These things I said not unto
   you at the beginning, because I was with you;" as implying, Soon I
   shall be with you, as you see Me now, no more. "I go My way to Him that
   sent Me." By these words He intended to prepare them not only for His
   death and burial, and for the three short days of His resting in the
   grave, but for His ascension into heaven, when He should go up on high,
   and sit down, until the end, at the right hand of God. When they heard
   Him speak of going away, they were filled with sorrow. To lose their
   Lord was to lose their all. They had lived in daily and hourly converse
   with Him, till they had come to live by Him and in Him as their very
   life. They had hung upon His lips, and learned the mysteries of the
   kingdom of grace; they had waited upon His divine hands, and seen the
   miracles of His power. His person was the pledge of His kingdom,--the
   earnest of the twelve thrones on which they trusted that they should
   sit with Him in the regeneration. All hung upon Him, and with Him all
   would depart. To lose Him would turn their hopes into a vain show, and
   scatter all their expectations as a dream. They would be utterly
   forsaken,--outcast from home,--spoiled of their Master's
   presence,--losers on every side, both in this life and in that which
   was to come. The world, with its hard, cold reality, boded to them a
   rough and suffering future,--a heavy reprisal for their rashness in
   breaking with its favour, and venturing all upon His word.

   It was, therefore, to comfort and strengthen them beforehand that He
   said, "It is expedient for you that I go away. I go, but not for My own
   sake; it is for yours. Believe My word, that for your consolation I am
   departing. When I am gone, ye shall receive greater things than these.
   If I stay, they will not be given. If I go, I will send them. Ye shall
   have a Comforter, who shall abide with you for ever. To lose Me shall
   be your gain." Now this sounds strange and unlikely: as to them, so to
   us. They could ill understand how the loss of their Teacher, Lord, and
   Guide should be gain to them; nor can we perhaps, at least at all
   times, realise why it is better for us that He should have gone away.
   We often think, that to see Him would waken and support our faith,
   kindle our love, deepen our contrition, solve all our doubts, teach us
   all doctrines, and admit us into all mysteries. We long to put
   ourselves into the place of St. John or St. Thomas, and think that, by
   closer contact with His visible presence, we should be made penitent,
   faithful, and loving. We think, or at least feel and imagine, that the
   world is at a disadvantage, and that the Church has suffered a loss by
   the departure of our Lord; that if He were visibly among us now, the
   course and order of all things would be turned into a higher path, and
   would ascend steadily towards God. But in this we contradict His very
   words, and are blind to His manifest operations. It is expedient for
   us, no less than for them, that He should go away; that He should be no
   longer manifest on earth, but ascended into heaven. His departure was
   their gain, and it is ours. It is the gain of His whole Church on
   earth. Let us see how this can be.

   1. And first, because by His departure His local presence was changed
   into an universal presence.

   He had dwelt among them as Man, under the limitations of our humanity:
   in Galilee and Jerusalem, on the mountain and in the upper chamber,
   they had known Him according to the measures and laws of our nature. He
   had thereby revealed to them His very and true manhood. They had seen
   Him journeying, fasting, sorrowing, suffering; they had heard Him
   teaching by words of human and articulate speech; persuading by
   emotions of human and familiar sympathy. But this was only the prelude
   of their life of faith. They had yet greater things to learn. They had
   to learn His very and true Godhead; His divine and infinite Majesty.
   And this was to be revealed from an higher sphere and by a mightier
   revelation of Himself. God was manifest in the flesh: but their hearts
   were too earthly to conceive the fulness of this mystery. Sense bounded
   them about. As yet they knew not the perfection of His divine Person.
   While He was with them, they saw, heard, and handled: they knew "Christ
   after the flesh;" when He ascended, they "knew Him so no more." Their
   limited and sense-bound perceptions were enlarged and purified. They
   dreamed no more of an earthly kingdom, or of investiture with temporal
   honours. By His ascension He sat down on His Father's throne, and
   assumed His kingdom in heaven and earth. He made them to feel the
   mystery of His divine Nature: He dwelt with them after the manner of a
   divine Person. He had said, "I will not leave you comfortless; I will
   come to you." And again, "Lo, I am with you alway." And He kept His
   word: He came to them in the Comforter. The day of Pentecost was the
   enlargement of His Presence from a local and visible shape to an
   invisible and universal fulness. As the Father dwells in the Son, so
   the Son in the Holy Ghost. In the presence of God the Holy Ghost, God
   the Son is ever with us. The Eternal Word, Who from the beginning was
   in the world by His divine power and Godhead, and then dwelt among us
   in the substance of our flesh, is now with us not less, but still more
   intimately than before. As God, He dwells with us through the Holy
   Ghost, by His essence, presence, and power. But more than this: as Man
   He is also with us in all the truth of His incarnation. He is not with
   us in visible shape, nor in local dimension, nor in the configuration
   of His human form. In these finite and circumscribed properties of
   manhood He is at the right hand of God, visibly manifest and glorious
   in the midst of His heavenly court. Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus Christ
   dwells in His Church for ever. The Godhead and the Manhood in Him are
   so united as to be no more divided. The Divine Person of the Word made
   flesh, as it is indivisible, so it is every where and whole in every
   place. Wheresoever the Son is, there is the mind, spirit, heart,
   sympathy, and will of His divine humanity. By union with Godhead it has
   been exalted above the limits of our finite state. If I must speak in
   the words of our infirmity, I may say that His human soul, with its
   perfections, is above all conditions of place, and filleth all things.
   The character of the Lord Jesus Christ, His pity, gentleness, patience,
   long-suffering, love, tenderness, compassion, is shed abroad throughout
   all His Church. The kingdom of Christ is the kingdom of the Man Christ
   Jesus; and the reign of His will, human as well as divine, is His
   kingdom.

   And there are even deeper things than these. The mystery of the
   incarnation is not a mere isolated fact, terminating in the personality
   of the Word made Flesh, but the beginning and productive cause of a new
   creation of mankind. By the same Omnipotence which wrought the union of
   the Godhead and the manhood in the womb of the blessed Virgin, the
   humanity of the second Adam is the immediate and substantial instrument
   of our regeneration and renewal. It has, therefore, a supernatural
   presence throughout the whole mystical body of Christ. As the substance
   of the first man is the productive cause of the whole human race, so
   the Manhood of the second, in its reality and presence, is extended
   throughout the Church. It is the presence of God which upholds all the
   creation of nature: it is the presence of the incarnate Word which
   upholds all the creation of grace. It is the influx of the divine
   essence which supports the natural world: it is the influx of the
   divine incarnation which supports the world of the redeemed.

   And this supernatural creation began from the ascension of our Lord
   into heaven. "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far
   above all heavens, that He might fill all things." [37] "All things are
   put under His feet," and He is "the head over all things to the Church,
   which is His body; the fulness of Him that filleth all in all:" [38]
   that is, the production and overflow of His life and substance,--the
   fruit and fulfilment of His incarnation,--the complement and perfection
   of His mystical body. What is the Church but Christ's invisible
   presence openly manifested by a visible organisation? The Church is
   Christ mystical,--the presence of Christ, by the creative power of His
   incarnation, produced and prolonged on earth. Truly said He, "It is
   expedient for you that I go away."

   2. And further than this. His departure changed their imperfect
   knowledge into the full illumination of faith.

   While He was yet with them, He taught them by word of mouth. But the
   mysteries of His passion and resurrection were not as yet fulfilled,
   and their hearts were slow of understanding. "I have yet many things to
   say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now." "These things I said not
   unto you at the beginning, because I was with you." His visible
   presence made divine truths sound strange and paradoxical. To hear Him
   speak as God: "He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;" "I and My
   Father are one;" "All things are Mine, and Mine are Thine,"--these were
   hard sayings. What wonder if Philip should say, "Shew us the Father;"
   and Thomas, "We know not whither Thou goest, and how can we know the
   way?" [39] While He was yet with them, these truths were veiled by His
   visible presence. The Truth itself lay hid in Him. Their minds were
   earthly, and interpreted all things by the rules of earth and sense.
   But when the Comforter came, all things were brought back to their
   remembrance. Old truths and perplexing memories received their true
   solution. Words they had mused upon in doubt were interpreted; sayings
   they had thought already clear were seen to have profounder meanings; a
   fountain of light sprung up within them, an illumination cast from an
   unseen teacher unfolded to their consciousness the deep things of God
   and of His Christ. Their very faculties were enlarged: they were no
   longer pent up by narrow senses and by the succession of time, but were
   lifted into a light where all things are boundless and eternal. A new
   power of insight was implanted in their spiritual being, and a new
   world rose up before it; for the spirit of truth dwelt in them, and the
   world unseen was revealed.

   The coming of the Holy Ghost was in itself a revelation. The Father
   sent the Son to reveal Himself. The Son ascended up on high, and sent
   the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost came, revealing both the Father and the
   Son. The inward illumination of His own invisible presence united the
   consciousness of man with the Spirit of God. There is a language above
   all speech,--a teaching which needs neither voice nor vision, which
   passes neither eye nor ear. The inspirations of God come in manifold
   ways, yet are tied to no mechanical order. They transcend all
   organisations of sense; they come at times by insights and intuitions;
   by lights which fall inwardly upon the deep of our consciousness,
   shining by their own radiance, attesting their own advent from God.
   Such was the coming of the Holy Ghost. His inspirations were not by the
   tongues of fire, but by the lights of His own indwelling. This was the
   last and perfect act in the ascending scale of the divine
   dispensations: lifting man above sense and thought, space and time,
   into eternity, and the ever enlarging sphere of God's presence and
   kingdom. That which had been an object of sight became an object of
   faith. The Person once visible on earth had become the Head of a
   hierarchy of eternal truths. Mysteries, of which they had before seen
   only parts and fragments, now combined in unity and splendour to a full
   and perfect orb. The earthly history of the man Jesus Christ was taken
   up into the eternal mysteries of heaven. Then was fixed on high the
   heavenly stair by which God descends to man and man ascends to God.
   Then were revealed the mystery and glory of the ever-blessed Three; the
   depths of the Incarnation; the humiliation of the eternal Son; the
   exaltation of manhood above all orders of angels and spirits to the
   throne of God; the blessedness of the Virgin Mother; the passion of
   God; the descent of Life Eternal to the grave; the rising of
   Immortality from death; the opening of the heavenly court; the unity
   and communion of the Church in earth and heaven. All these divine
   realities stood forth in substance and in truth before the illuminated
   intuition of the Church. While He was with them, these things were
   hidden: when He departed, they shone forth "as the body of heaven in
   its clearness." [40] While He was with them, He was their living,
   perpetual, unerring guide; and they, visibly united with Him, were led
   with sure and advancing steps along the path of truth. When He
   departed, the Spirit of Truth took up all that He had revealed, and
   unfolded it with great accessions of divine illumination. He then
   opened a ministry of interior and perfect faith, which has guided His
   Church in all ages and in all lands unto this day. His own teaching was
   partial and local: the guidance of the Spirit is plenary and universal.
   And our Teacher departs not, but abides with us for ever: a guide ever
   present, though invisible; ever presiding, though in silence; unerring,
   though teaching through human reason and by human speech. The Spirit of
   Truth is Christ Himself by His Spirit guiding and teaching still; no
   more a slender company of slow and wondering hearts, but the whole
   Church of God throughout the world; sustaining in its spiritual
   consciousness, in the successive and continuous line of its spiritual
   and intellectual life, the whole mystery of God, the unfading image of
   the heavenly Truth. This is the divine gift of faith. And thus, again,
   He has fulfilled His word of promise, "It is expedient for you that I
   go away."

   3. And lastly, His departure changed the partial dispensations of grace
   into the fulness of the regeneration.

   From the beginning of the world, the Spirit of God had striven with the
   sin of man and sanctified His elect; but His visitations were secret
   and unknown.

   Under the Law, though more wide-spread and abundant, they were still
   uncertain and restrained. The fulness of time was not yet come, and the
   great promise of the Spirit was awaiting its predestined season.

   Between the Law and the Gospel, though given in larger measure, the
   gifts of the Holy Spirit were but an earnest of the day of Pentecost.

   The incarnation of the Son was a necessary prelude to the regeneration.
   It is a mystery peculiar to the person and kingdom of Christ. A new
   Head was needed for the restoration of mankind, and that Head must
   needs be man.

   The ascension of the Son was the condition of the descent of the Holy
   Ghost: "The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not
   yet glorified." [41] The coming of the Holy Ghost is the gift of the
   regeneration to us. He descended not as a power or principle, nor as an
   endowment or quality infused into the soul of man, but as a divine
   Person to dwell in us. And His indwelling is after a manner unlike any
   before. What, then, is the regeneration for which the world waited? It
   is the incarnation of the Son of God. Our nature, which He had made
   sinless, deathless, and divine, from the time of His ascension into
   heaven was glorified. The second Adam began to give of His own
   spiritual nature, to multiply the lineage of His elect, and to gather
   His mystical family into one universal body. The agent in this divine
   work is the Holy Ghost dwelling in us. "Whom He did foreknow, He also
   did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son;" and "whom He
   did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also
   justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified." [42] That
   is, upon them He bestowed the glory of the adoption, the gift of the
   Spirit, the right of sons to cry, Abba, Father; a share in the Sonship
   and inheritance of Christ, a participation of "the divine nature," [43]
   that is, of the divine manhood of Jesus Christ. It is bestowed upon us
   in its virtue and beginning now; it shall be made perfect according to
   the measure of our humanity in His kingdom. "Behold, what manner of
   love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the
   sons of God." "It doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know
   that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him
   as He is." [44]

   The incarnation raised mankind to a higher life, and laid a higher law
   upon us: the coming of the Holy Ghost endowed man with power to walk in
   that higher and more perfect path. We shall see this if we compare the
   saints of the Old Testament with the saints of the New; or the Apostles
   with themselves, before and after the day of Pentecost. The spiritual
   presence of our Lord Jesus Christ endowed them with an infallible
   certainty, an inflexible will, and a measure of His own sanctity. They
   had sprung up from childhood into manhood. And their maturity is the
   root on which the Church is grafted. It was of this that our Lord said,
   "Verily I say unto you, of them that are born of women, there hath not
   risen a greater than John the Baptist; notwithstanding, he that is
   least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he." What does our
   blessed Lord here intend, but that the state of the regeneration is so
   incomparably high, that the least within it is, not in personal
   attainment, but in spiritual gifts, higher than the greatest without
   it? And again He says, "Ye which have followed Me, in the regeneration
   when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall
   sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." [45]

   Clearly, in these words He is promising, first and absolutely, a final
   reward, when, at the resurrection at the last day, all His elect shall
   be born again from the dust of the earth, perfect both in body and
   soul, but also, and inclusively, He is promising a spiritual kingdom
   from the time of the regeneration, which began from His own
   resurrection, and is now fulfilling in the world. It signifies the
   kingdom of grace, by which He dwells in us and we in Him, now in this
   life. It also ordains the princedom of the Spirit, which the Apostles
   hold unto this day in the Israel of God. They in their successors are
   the ministers and distributors of His grace, of His spirit, and of His
   sacrifice, at the font and at the altar, binding and loosing, opening
   and shutting with the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

   This, then, is the regeneration, the last and crowning work of
   redeeming grace, for which God's elect were waiting. The saints of old,
   from Abel, had died in faith; "God having provided some better thing
   for us, that they without us should not be made perfect." What is that
   "better thing," but the redemption of our manhood from sin and death in
   the person of Jesus Christ, and the power of this redemption applied to
   each one by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost? They too are now made
   perfect: they have been united to the incarnate God; and every soul so
   united to Him is united also to His whole mystical body, to the
   universal company of all saints in earth and heaven, to the communion
   of life, love, energy, worship, intercession of all His servants, in
   warfare and in rest. This is the new creation, rising and unfolding
   itself "into the measure of the stature of Christ;" or rather it
   descends from heaven: it hangs from the hand of God, and is knit
   together by heavenly sacraments and ministries of spiritual power. Into
   this mystical orb of light He is ever gathering His elect; sanctifying
   them by His indwelling presence, and sealing them for Himself. As they
   are made perfect, they pass onward and upward to sit and reign with Him
   in heavenly places, partakers of His nature and of His kingdom.

   It is expedient, then, for us, that He is gone unto the Father. If He
   had tarried upon earth, all had stood still. It would have been as a
   perpetual promise of day, a lingering blossom and a retarded fruit, a
   lengthening childhood and a backward maturity. The work of God is ever
   unfolding and advancing. He must needs have come, died, and ascended.
   "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone;
   but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." [46] If He had tarried
   with us, He had abode alone; the Comforter had not come; His mystical
   body had not been knit together; His truth and spirit had not dwelt in
   us. While He was upon earth, all was local, exterior, and imperfect:
   now all is universal, inward, and divine. The corn of wheat is not
   alone. It hath borne much fruit, even an hundredfold; and its fruit is
   multiplied, in all ages and in all the earth, by a perpetual growth and
   a perpetual reproduction.

   The day of Pentecost is an ever present miracle. It stands in its
   fulness even until now, and we are partakers of its presence and its
   power Therefore the Church is one, because He is one; holy, because He
   is holy; catholic, because His presence is local no more; apostolic,
   because He still sends His own servants; indefectible, because He is
   the Life; unerring, because He is the Truth. And to perfect this
   mystery of grace, it was needful that He should go away. He departed,
   but only that He might come back in all the fulness of His presence.
   Our Lord Jesus Christ is with us still. He reigns and teaches in His
   Church. His presence is the life of the elect, the perpetuity of faith,
   the reality of sacraments. Baptism regenerates; the keys of the kingdom
   bind and loose; confirmation strengthens; ordination sends in His name;
   the holy eucharist is a sacrifice before His Father, and a sacrament of
   life to His disciples, because with deeper revelations, and a fuller
   bestowal of Himself, He has come to us again, that, believing, we may
   have life, and that we "may have it more abundantly."

SERMON VI.

  CHRIST VISIBLE TO LOVING HEARTS.

    ST. JOHN xvi. 16.

   "A little while, and ye shall not see Me: and again a little while, and
   ye shall see Me, because I go to the Father."

   THIS was a strange saying, and a stranger reason: "A little while, and
   ye shall not see Me; and again a little while, and ye shall see Me,"
   and that "because I go to the Father." How should His going away be the
   pledge of their seeing Him again? What wonder they said, "What is this
   that He saith?" "We cannot tell what He saith." And yet these words are
   plainly and divinely true.

   There have already been three manifestations of our blessed Lord, and
   there shall be yet a fourth. The three first ascending to the last,
   which shall be full, perfect, eternal.

   First, He has been seen by the eye, when He came in our manhood: "God
   was manifest in the flesh." [47] "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt
   among us, and we beheld His glory;" [48] "That which was from the
   beginning, . . . . which we have seen with our eyes, which we have
   looked upon; . . . for the Life was manifested, and we have seen it."
   [49] From His birth to His baptism, from His baptism to His cross, from
   His cross to His burial; by visible presence, by miracles of power in
   Galilee and in Jerusalem, in life and in death, He manifested Himself
   to the sight of men. And so again after He rose from the dead. He did
   indeed thus manifest Himself to those that loved Him,--to the company
   of women and to Peter, to the eleven in the upper chamber, to the five
   hundred in the mountain, to the disciples on the seashore, and to all
   His Apostles when, for the last time, He led them out to Bethany. They
   had kept His word, and loved Him; and He loved them, and shewed Himself
   to them. But this is not the manifestation promised here. That was but
   local, partial, and transitory; this of which He here speaks is
   something larger and more abiding.

   Again, He has also manifested Himself to the ear. He gave commandment
   to His Apostles that they should "Go teach all nations." And "have they
   not heard? Yes, verily their sound is gone out into all lands, and
   their words unto the ends of the world." "The earth is filled with the
   knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." He has manifested
   Himself these eighteen hundred years to all the kingdoms of the earth.
   The name, the person, the love, the sacrifice, the presence of Christ
   has been revealed to the ear of all people. Who has not heard of Him,
   young and old, high and low, wise and simple? But neither is this the
   promised manifestation; for this too is an exterior revelation, made to
   all alike, to the good and to the evil, to those that love Him and to
   those that love Him not.

   What He here promises is something special and interior, deeper and
   more intimate, the peculiar gift of those who "keep His commandments."
   It is a manifestation, not to the eye or to the ear, but to a sense
   above both hearing and sight; a spiritual sense, comprehending all
   powers of perception, to which all other senses are but avenues. "He
   that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me;
   and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him,
   and manifest Myself to him." [50] And that "because I go to the
   Father." When I am ascended, I will return with a presence, not local,
   but in and above all place; not transient, but abiding; not visible to
   the eye, but to the heart, by a power of spiritual intuition. In these
   words He promises an illumination of the heart: "Lo, I am with you
   alway, even to the end of the world." And this presence is no mere
   figure, but a reality; this manifestation no empty metaphor, but a
   shewing of Himself to our spiritual sense; a perception which should be
   equal to the perception of sight in all fulness, vividness, and truth.

   Let us therefore take an example. What does the sight of any one, as,
   for instance, of a friend, bestow upon us? What are its effects?

   1. The first effect it produces in us is a sense of his presence. We
   know what his coming and going awakens. It may be we were waiting for
   his arrival full of other thoughts, busy or weary, or musing, or all
   but forgetful. When he came, we were wakened up in every pulse. All our
   whole heart and mind, with all its affections and attention, fixed upon
   him. We are called, not only out of our former works and thoughts, but
   out of our very selves. Our hearts go forth to meet him. He is there
   before us. We see him, recognise him again; he sees us, and fixes our
   sight upon himself. Some such effect is wrought in faithful hearts by
   this promise of our Lord. As God, He is ever present with us. He is in
   all things by His essence, presence, and power. But beyond this, as
   Man, He is with us still by the indivisible unity of Godhead and
   manhood in His person, by the perpetual and intimate presence of His
   mind, heart, and sympathy. The forty days of His tarrying upon earth
   were a revelation of His abiding presence with the Church for ever.
   They were a season of training, to prepare His Apostles and all who
   should believe in Him through, their word, to live by faith in His
   unseen but personal nearness.

   We feel the same, though perhaps less vividly, towards friends with
   whom we habitually dwell. Daily sight keeps up the sense that they are
   with us. Even when for a while withdrawn, home is still full of them:
   it is their home; our haunts are their haunts; the memory of something
   said or done, intended or desired, hangs about all we see. Every thing
   has some link with them. We have a living sense that they are related
   to us, and we to them; that we are one with them, and that they are
   never far away. Absence is not so much to be far off as out of sight,
   and to be out of sight is to be even more in mind. The inner faculties
   become quicker and more intense in those whose natural sight is
   wanting. They possess a sense above sight, bestowing all the inward
   perceptions of sight in a deeper way. If it has less of colour and
   form, it has even more of reality and truth. So it is with the
   spiritual manifestation of our Lord to hearts that see by love. As in
   the forty days while He tarried yet upon the earth, before He went up
   on high, though not always with His disciples, He was always near;
   though not always visible, yet He was always seen; for the sustained
   consciousness of loving spirits saw Him at all times by the vision of
   faith. He was, as it were, always meeting them, and saying, "All hail;"
   always standing in the midst, breathing on them, and speaking peace;
   always making their hearts to burn, and their understandings to break
   forth with new lights of truth.

   So it is with those who love Him now. He shews Himself by a secret
   unveiling of His presence. Their whole life is full of a sense that He
   is near; and they know, by an inward faculty, that they are living with
   Him and for Him.

   2. Another effect wrought by the. sight of a friend, is a perception of
   his character. We learn what others are, not so much by hearsay as by
   intercourse. It is with character as it is with countenance. We may
   hear a person's look and figure minutely and vividly described; we may
   see also a perfect portrait, and know the outline and feature, the
   colouring and peculiarity of his appearance; but there is something
   which can never be described or drawn; something we call expression in
   the countenance,--a fineness of meaning in the lines, and change in the
   play of features; something which, like the tone of the voice, speaks,
   and alone can speak, for itself. What are all portraits to one sight of
   the very countenance? Much more is this true of character, which is a
   thing so complex, so fine, so mysterious, made up of so many parts, or
   rather of the balance of so many powers and gifts. We may as well try
   to describe motion or light. Read the fullest and most detailed
   biographies; imagine the most vivid picture of the subject; but what is
   all biography to one meeting? Then the moral life which is in the one
   speaks to the moral sense which is in the other by a language which has
   no written character. It is of a higher order of knowledge; of a sphere
   where all communion is direct, by intuition and mutual intelligence;
   where the alphabet is "Alpha and Omega,--the First and the Last." So is
   it in those who love the Lord Jesus. When He shews Himself by the
   illumination of the heart, then all we have read turns into reality.
   The holy Gospels rise up into a living person $ they live and breathe
   before us. Then we understand and perceive, by a spiritual
   appreciation, His sanctity and pureness, His lowliness and patience,
   His meekness and tenderness, His love and sympathy. We feel with whom
   we have to do: what He is in Himself. We perceive that His presence,
   which was visible once on earth, has dwelt steadfast until now; and
   that the character of divine compassion recorded by evangelists is a
   continuous reality. It is as near, as real, and as full of grace as at
   Nain and Bethany. And our spiritual perception has been wakened by His
   presence to feel,--if I dare so speak, and why should I not?--to taste
   His character. We "taste that the Lord is gracious." Now this is a
   spiritual perception which only spiritual communion can bestow. And by
   this communion, in a way transcending the senses of our earthly nature,
   He manifests His character to those who love Him. This spiritual
   perception of His character by love is the beginning of His likeness in
   us. Love likens us to each other, and above all to Him. It is the power
   of assimilation: and likeness of heart is also an instrument of
   perception. It is by loving that we see and understand the reality of
   His perfect character, and are conscious of His compassion, ever
   present and encompassing us about.

   3. We may take one more effect of sight. It gives us a consciousness of
   the love of a friend for us. There is something in his eye, look, and
   bearing, which is expressive above all words, and emphatic above all
   speech.

   When God was made Man, He put on human affections and human sympathies.
   The Divine love is boundless, all-embracing, infinite; human affections
   are particular, finite, and personal. He became our kinsman, brother,
   and friend; and He assumed all the affections of these human relations.
   He loved according to the love of kinsman and of friend. Particular
   affections, we know, are consistent with perfect love. The very name of
   "the beloved disciple" is witness enough. Out of His followers, He ever
   loves with especial love the children of the beatitudes. He loves, with
   a distinguishing love of friendship, those who are most like Himself.
   There are deeper things in this mystery of love than we can fathom. He
   says, "I will love him." But surely He does already love all His
   servants,--nay, all sinners, for whom He died--all creatures whom He
   hath made. But there is somewhat more in these words. There is a love
   with which, as God, He loved all mankind eternally; and another deeper
   love, with which He loved all whom He foreknew would love Him again. In
   His foreknowledge, all His elect people love Him and are loved. But
   there is a deeper mystery still. The Word was made flesh, and, as man,
   comes down into this world of time; He sees, one by one, those whom He
   foreknew made perfect in actual obedience. As, one by one, they love
   Him, He loves them, and shews Himself to them. When the disciple whom
   Jesus loved lay on His breast at supper, the foreknowledge of
   everlasting love had its fulfilment. So with every one who shall love
   Him unto the end of the world. "He that hath My commandments, and
   keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be
   loved of My Father, and I will love him;" that is, I will receive him,
   as the love of election is fulfilled in him, and I will make him know
   My love. "I will manifest Myself to him." I, who chose him before he
   yet was, died for him while he was yet a sinner, loved him when he
   loved Me not, will love him, with a manifold love, now that he loves Me
   again. "I will manifest Myself to him." He shall know Me, who, unknown,
   have done all this for him; unseen, have been ever with him; in
   childhood, and all ages of life; in sorrow and joy, sickness and
   health, in happiness and in solitude, in light and darkness, blessing
   and chastisement. He shall see Me, and feel My presence; know Me, and
   comprehend My love. He hath heard of Me "by the hearing of the ear, but
   now" his eye shall see Me.

   "A little while, and ye shall see Me." And this spiritual sight is the
   very life of faith. Without it, the manifest presence of the Word made
   flesh would profit nothing. The beholding of His person here visibly
   before us, as in the temple or in the synagogue of Nazareth, would
   avail nothing to those whose hearts lack love and sight. We should look
   upon Him as they did, and say, Is not this the carpenter? We should
   behold Him even upon His cross, and gaze upon His five sacred wounds,
   with a hard unmeaning eye. To cold hearts they have no mystery or
   meaning.

   We see, then, what is the promise, and who they are to whom it shall be
   given. It is the benediction of those who love Him. And this love is no
   dreamy emotion, no weak and fanciful sentiment, but a deep masculine
   reality, the life of an energetic character. "He that hath My
   commandments,"--that is, not in the intellect alone, but in the
   conscience, in the heart and in the will. "And keepeth them,"--makes
   them his law, and by that law guides his life. There is need of a
   deeper force than the imagination, of a stronger impulse than feelings
   and emotions, to form the spirit of those to whom this manifestation
   shall be granted. Let us, then, take two plain counsels for our
   guidance in seeking it.

   1. The one is, to keep our hearts clear from all conscious sin. Where
   sin is, there Christ is hidden. Though He be with us from our baptism,
   yet while we sin He is as the light which "shineth in darkness, and the
   darkness comprehendeth it not." Sin is the darkness of the soul. Though
   the whole firmament of grace and love shine above it, yet all is black
   and shrouded. Sinful Christians have Christ's commandments indeed, but
   do not keep them. Better not to have them at all, than, having them,
   not to keep them. But this is too plain to need more words. We have
   nearer dangers; for though we do not break His commandments, yet we may
   be most unlike His spirit. Our character may be the opposite of His,
   or, as we say, there may be an antipathy between His mind and ours, and
   then how shall He manifest Himself to us? What fellowship can there be
   between His humility and our pride, His purity and our soils, His
   meekness and our wrath, His patience and our fiery spirits, His
   self-denial and our self-indulgence? Do we not know that men of
   opposite characters are mutually unintelligible? What does the man who
   is all for this world understand of one who is living for the next; or
   the man who never prays, of one who is devout? As these are severed by
   a direct antipathy, so also are jealous, proud, selfish, vain-glorious
   Christians severed from their Redeemer. A veil hangs between them, and
   He is unseen. And hardly less is to be said of those who have
   unfeeling, apathetic hearts. Alas, are not they the great multitude of
   Christians, neither decisively holy or unholy, devout or indevout? How
   many there are who approve and commend, but have no delight in a life
   of faith. Meekness, lowliness, self-denial, devotion, are to them
   beautiful images, but tasteless realities. The love and the sorrow of
   our divine Lord have for them neither sweetness nor sharpness. To them
   He is not "precious." They are easy, calm, unexcited, unimpassioned.
   Often they commend themselves for their temperate, reasonable,
   judicious piety. In their own sight they may be blameless; but in His
   they are ungenerous, cold, illiberal, unloving. To such hearts He makes
   little manifestation of Himself. For them "He hath no form nor
   comeliness," no beauty that they should desire Him; and to them,
   therefore, He is veiled.

   Now such as some of these we shall find ourselves to be; and so long as
   there is upon us any conscious sin, we cannot receive this special
   gift.

   Let us, then, search our hearts day by day, and see what it is which
   hides Him from us. If we have never yet seen Him by His promised
   illumination, it is a sign that something in us must still be cleansed
   away. Morning and night let us seek it out; convicting our hearts by
   the perfection of His heart. There are two sure ways to keep the soul
   clear from conscious sin: the one is, uniform obedience; and the other,
   prompt confession. Let us suffer nothing to harbour and fester in our
   hearts, but at once cast it forth at His feet by a pure and penitent
   confession. Even sins of the lighter kind, of thought and temper, if
   they are allowed to linger, make up by duration what they want in
   magnitude. They taint and estrange the heart, and make us shrink from
   His presence, until we have confessed them. This is the remedy of our
   imperfect service and our many infirmities. We may cast them all out
   before Him as our sorrows and our burdens, and He will not impute them
   to us. It is specially to hearts cleansed by confession that He shews
   Himself by His inward coming. Mary at the tomb is the pledge of His
   appearing to sinners who are penitents. And who can fear or shrink from
   laying open their hearts to such miraculous love, or of speaking the
   worst of themselves at the feet of His absolving pity?

   2. The other counsel is, to ask, day by day, that He will shew Himself
   to you. For this manifestation of His presence, character, and love is
   not to be obtained by power of intellect, or by vividness of
   imagination, or by any effort of ours. We cannot reveal Him to
   ourselves. All that we can do is, to cleanse our hearts of their films
   and darkness, that He may shine into them. Nothing can we do more, but
   say, "Lord, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us." We
   cannot make the sun to rise upon the earth. But "God, who commanded the
   light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the
   light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus
   Christ." [51] We must ask of Him without fainting, that He will shew
   Himself. And there are three ways of seeking this great gift. One is by
   habitual prayer, another by quiet meditation, and a third, which is
   above all, by frequent communion. It is then that He specially fulfils
   His promise. As at Emmaus, so now, He is known in the breaking of
   bread. This is that commandment which we have of Him, "Do this in
   remembrance of Me." Happy are they who keep it well; to whom the altar
   is the centre of their worship, the object of their desire, the source
   of strength and peace. Blessed are they who say, "I will go to the
   altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy;" to our God manifest in the
   flesh, but veiled in that pure mystery. The holy sacrament of His love
   and passion is the fullest realisation of His presence unto the end of
   the world. "Lo, I am with you." Let us so live, as to be ever drawing
   near. For what is so like to the days when He went in and out among
   them that loved Him? What so fastens upon us a sense that He is here;
   that He is come to us, and that He calleth for us? They who so live
   know what it is to be awakened and quickened as by the presence of some
   one greatly loved; or if they complain, as many do, of distant and cold
   hearts, even at the altar, it is often because their consciousness of
   how loving and how near He is, acts by an opposite effect, revealing to
   them, not what they have, but what they need. The more we know what He
   is, and feel Him near, the more we shall accuse ourselves, and see our
   own unworthiness. For His presence at the altar is all that we can
   endure in this life of earth. To behold more would be heaven, for which
   we are not meet. He is teaching us, little by little, to see His face
   unveiled. "I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
   now." In heaven they shall be most blessed who have known Him most
   fully here. They here shall know Him best who see Him with greatest
   clearness. They see Him clearest now whose hearts are most like His
   own.

   At His appearing to the disciples in Galilee, on the mountain where He
   had appointed them, "when they saw Him, they worshipped Him; but some
   doubted." They doubted not that He was their Lord, nor that He had
   suffered agony and death upon the cross, nor that He had risen from the
   dead; but they doubted their own certainty of sight, like as they who
   believed not for joy, and wondered; or as when they saw Him at the sea,
   and none durst ask Him, "Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord."
   So it is now with you. It may be you are doubting, not of Him, but of
   yourselves; not whether He is with you, but whether your hearts have
   ever seen Him. Only believe for a little while: "a little while, and ye
   shall see Me." And there shall be no doubting then; when He shall be
   visibly revealed in the kingdom of the resurrection, and you shall be
   pure in heart to behold Him in the beatific vision.

   What is a little while? A little more sickness, sorrow, mourning, and
   solitude; a little more of striving and persevering. A little while is
   soon over; and then we shall be changed into a changeless joy. Then "we
   shall see Him as He is." What, then, is "a little while," if in a
   little while we may see Him for ever?

SERMON VII.

  COMPLAINING A HINDRANCE TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE.

    JOB xxix. 2, 3, 4.

   "Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved
   me; when His candle shined upon my head, and when by His light I walked
   through darkness; as I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of
   God was upon my tabernacle!"

   THESE are sad and bitter words, the complaining of a man who had once
   known days of peace and light, but was now in affliction. In years
   past, Job had lived in fellowship with God, encompassed with His
   mercies, full of His gifts. He had received blessings in the house and
   in the field, in the basket and in the store. He had his children round
   about him, and his people held him in honour. A change came over his
   life. God hid His face, and Job was troubled. The tempter received
   power to try his faith, and smote him with sore afflictions. Childless
   and spoiled, he sat upon the ground in his wounds and sickness,
   pleading with God and bemoaning his desolation. "Oh that I were as in
   months past!" This is a tone of mourning very common among men at all
   times, and in all trials of life: not only by the graves of past
   happiness, and in the loneliness of ordinary sorrow, but in spiritual
   sadness, in the heavy cloud which often comes down upon the soul even
   of God's true servants.

   It is very common to hear those who have long served God speak of times
   past as times of joy, and of the time present as a time of declension.
   We have all our golden age. The season of childhood, or the first
   fervour of conversion, the first burst of conscious faith, the first
   exulting spring out of the bonds of a worldly life, when life seems
   over, and heaven already won: blessed days and nights, when even in
   dreams God seems to speak with us--all these are times which, in
   retrospect, have a peculiar brightness. After a while, they seem past
   away, and we say, "Oh that I were . . . . as I was in the days of my
   youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle!"

   Sometimes, indeed, these complainings have no reality j but sometimes
   they are true. For instance, people who have been brought up in a home
   full of helps to the spiritual life, sometimes pass into others as full
   of hindrances. Some, after having been earnest with imperfect light, on
   gaining greater light, grow, not without cause, dissatisfied with their
   state. Others, again, from various causes, voluntary and involuntary,
   sometimes slacken their speed, or they fall into a scrupulous, fearful,
   and self-vexing mood, in which their very earnestness becomes a danger.
   If they had less fear, they would have less scruple, and more peace in
   God. Such people are very apt to use this complaint. They remember what
   they were; they feel what they are: it is as joy to heaviness, strength
   to weakness, the light of God's countenance to coldness and desolation.
   What, then, shall they do?

   1. First, it is most necessary that they should learn to look out of
   themselves.

   This sounds strange advice. How, then, they ask, can we examine our own
   hearts? And if we do not examine them, how shall we either correct our
   faults, or even know them? It is not to be denied that there is a
   difficulty in this. And yet we know that we may take a wise and
   sufficient care of our bodily health, without becoming fearful or
   fanciful, or, as we commonly say, valetudinarian. It all depends upon
   the manner and the tone of mind. We all know that fancies beget
   diseases, nay, are diseases in themselves. So it is with the spiritual
   health. Self-examination will be healthy or unhealthy just as we make
   it. One person will use it with a perfect habit of self-forgetfulness,
   and another will be haunted by a perpetual self-contemplation.

   There is no doubt that the habit of looking into ourselves, and
   dwelling upon ourselves, produces a train of spiritual evils, such as
   scruples, sadness, fearfulness, misgiving, doubting of God, shrinking,
   depression, despondency, weakness, religious egotism, and the like For
   in truth, many look into themselves when they ought to be looking to
   the Sacrifice upon the cross. Some do so from want of faith, some from
   self-trusting, some from self-love, some from mere natural
   feelings,--from the simple emotions of flesh and blood, chafing at
   themselves, and resenting their own faults, forgetting what they are,
   and why redeemed. There is no doubt that much of the sadness and
   depression people indulge, has its root in self-love. They are vexed to
   find themselves such poor creatures after all. They have been aiming
   high, and their pride ill brooks such falls. They have been passing
   themselves off, at least in their own eyes, for mature and advanced
   Christians, and their vanity is mortified to find sins and follies of
   which even worldly people might be ashamed. Then they grow saddened,
   sullen with themselves, disheartened, and sensitive to every vexation.

   But it is not always for such reasons. Sincere and humble minds often
   give way to fears at the clearer insight into their own sinfulness. It
   is a depth which we can hardly bear to look into. They who know the
   most of it know but little. Who can tell what he is in the sight of
   God, or even of holy angels? We cannot hold, all at once, in our
   consciousness even the acts of sin which we have committed in our past
   life; how much less our sins of word, thought, and imagination; least
   of all, the secret sins of our will. In God's presence, what a sight is
   a diseased soul, what soils, stains, and wounds; what distortions and
   running sores; what a mixture of darkness and fire are the passions and
   the intellect! What a miracle of sin is ingratitude, hardness,
   selfishness, sloth, lukewarmness, infidelity even at the foot of the
   cross! No one really knows himself as he is. God alone can measure and
   endure this revelation of our personal sinfulness. The most we see of
   it is but a little. There are two things which man cannot see and live,
   the Divine Majesty and his own sin. God in His tenderness veils us from
   ourselves, lest we should see ourselves, and die. Therefore it is not
   to be wondered at, if earnest and self-searching minds should, by
   poring into their sinfulness, at last prey upon themselves. They do it
   with a pure intention, and with a zealous hatred of sin. The more
   keenly they hate evil, the less they spare themselves. It is a zeal
   which eateth them up. And they continually mourn over some golden age
   which is past; some season when all was fair and bright; when they
   think they were less soiled and darkened, and God was more sensibly
   about them. But this, indeed, is not the truth. They were always what
   they are, only they knew not then what they know now. There has been no
   change, except in their consciousness of sin. What then slumbered is
   now awakened; all the change that has passed on them has been, not for
   the worse, but for the better: when they were unconscious of their sin,
   they were further from God; they are nearer now, because they see
   themselves to be exceeding sinful. It is He who is revealing it to
   them: it is His very nearness which awakens their consciousness. And
   they see not His light, but their own shadow, and this affrights them.

   Now, for such persons, it is most necessary that they should be drawn
   out of themselves. A sincere conscience will never fail to keep up a
   sufficient self-examination; it may be left in a kind of passive
   sovereignty, to act in defence and as a safeguard. But the active
   powers of their mind, the intellect and reason, need to be drawn
   outward. As in the wilderness the people of God were bid to gaze, not
   upon their burning wounds, but upon the serpent of brass which was
   lifted up to heal them, so these self-vexing spirits must look out upon
   the cross.

   2. And for this it is needful that they should realise more and more
   the objects of faith. While we look into ourselves, these become faint
   and dim. They must be fixedly and intently gazed upon to be habitually
   realised. When I say the objects of faith, I mean especially the
   presence and love of God, the sympathy and passion, the patience and
   tenderness, of our Blessed Lord, the presence and long-suffering of the
   Holy Ghost, the heavenly court, the communion of Saints, the love and
   ministry of angels; the whole world unseen and eternal. These are the
   changeless realities of faith, by which souls are drawn from this
   earthly and sensual life into harmony with the will and kingdom of God.
   They have a power to cleanse, sanctify, transfigure; to the sight of
   habitual faith, they become more near, visible, and real than the world
   we see. For all that we here behold are forms, shapes, and shifting
   outlines. This material world is not eternal, neither is it our home.
   It cannot endure for ever; we shall soon pass from it; itself shall
   soon pass away. Our home is in a supernatural order lifted above this
   world, to which even now we are related. It is only by going forth into
   this eternal sphere, living in it by faith, realising the truths and
   laws of the divine kingdom, the presence, personality, and love of our
   Redeemer, the mystery and majesty of the ever-blessed Three: it is only
   by this that the soul of man can be drawn away from its own evil.
   Except God be its centre, it will be a centre to itself. No creature
   will bear its weight; no created love can stay its yearning after rest.
   And if it find none, it will consume itself with chafing against its
   own miseries. It will never leave off to harass itself by brooding upon
   sin, until it has lost its morbid consciousness of self in the presence
   and love of God.

   All this is so plain, that it need hardly be said. The true question
   therefore is, How shall such self-vexing, self-depressing minds escape
   from themselves into these blessed and sustaining realities? If they
   could do this, it would be all well. It is because they cannot do this,
   that they are saddened and cast down.

   1. The first counsel to be given them is, to clear their mind of
   scruples. But this is their very disease. It is from this they desire
   to be set free. If they could clear their mind, then they would have no
   further trouble. They must begin, then, by searching out and clearly
   defining the cause of their scruples. If it be indulged faults, or
   favoured infirmities, or conscious omissions, or known unfairness with
   their conscience, or unresisted temptation, or willing indevotion, then
   let them confess it simply and clearly at the foot of the cross. Only
   let them guard against indulging in undefined and vague discomforts. We
   all know what it is to feel that something is vexing us, even while we
   cannot remember what it is; we feel ill at ease, and yet cannot tell
   why; it takes some moments' recollection to recall it; but the burden
   and sadness abide still upon us, though the causes are forgotten. It is
   just so in spiritual things; and needs to be much watched against.

   But if a person shall say, "I know what my trouble is, and what it
   springs from; and I have confessed it again and again, and yet I cannot
   find peace. I feel sure something is amiss. I cannot assure myself, and
   be at rest." Then theirs is exactly the case intended and described by
   the Church. "If any man cannot quiet his own conscience," let him come
   to some minister of God, and open his grief. The best course for such
   persons is, simply to follow the Church's counsel: to go to their
   pastor, confess their trouble in the presence of Christ and in the
   hearing of His servant, and receive the benefit of absolution. Then let
   it be a point of faith with them to trouble themselves no more. Let
   them simply "believe the word that Jesus hath spoken, and go their
   way." "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them."
   "Whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." Let
   them believe this with simple faith, as they believe the mystery of the
   Incarnation, and of our Lord's presence in His Church. And let them
   cast away all scruples; for scruples bring fears, and fears a shrinking
   dread; and these bring despondency, which is a sin against hope; and
   this brings estrangement, which is a sin against love. What is all this
   but to dishonour the miraculous compassion of our Lord, and to hinder
   the peaceful sanctification of their souls? There is hardly any
   spiritual disease more hurtful than scruples. They stunt and wither the
   spiritual life, and bring the soul into a bondage from which the Blood
   of Christ was shed to set them free.

   2. Another counsel is, to live in the habit of frequent communion.
   There is no means so powerful to draw us out of ourselves as the holy
   Sacrament of our Lord's presence. None so sets before us the realities
   of the spiritual world. In all other acts of the spiritual life, our
   minds depend chiefly m their own powers. In reading holy Scripture, we
   are sustained by our own intellectual acts; in prayer, we depend upon
   the strength and vividness of our interior affections: in both, our
   minds act upon themselves. But in the holy Communion we are in the very
   presence of our Lord. We see before us in a mystery the incarnation,
   the atoning sacrifice, the love and passion of our Redeemer, the love
   and mercy of the Father; "the flesh, which is meat indeed; the blood,
   which is drink indeed"--the fountain of cleansing, strength, solace,
   perseverance. We there go out of ourselves to Him. The very reason why
   we come is, because we are empty, fainting, and weak; we come that we
   may be filled out of His fulness. When we go to the altar, we go to the
   entrance of the world unseen; to the spot where the visible and
   invisible worlds unite. The oftener we draw near, the deeper will be
   our sense of these eternal realities. The oftener we communicate, the
   worthier we shall be for holy Communion; the deeper our humiliation,
   the ampler our self-accusing, the simpler our trust in the pardon and
   help of our Lord. And as there is no means so direct to deepen in us a
   sense of His love and nearness, so there is none so effectual to make
   us forget ourselves in habitual remembrance of Him.

   3. And, for a last counsel, it is good for such persons daily to
   exercise their minds upon these unseen realities. We spend time and
   care in cultivating the powers of the ear and of the voice, of the eye
   and of the intellect; all the faculties which are given to this world's
   service are carefully trained and exercised. But the spiritual powers
   of the soul we leave without discipline or culture. How can we hope to
   meditate without practice, any more than to reason or to calculate? We
   know how needful it is to apply our powers to the sciences of this
   visible world, and yet we live as if we thought the unseen world to
   have no mysteries, or our souls to need no discipline. Therefore it is
   that we have, at best, faint images, often none at all, of the only
   true and eternal reality. Towards the heavenly world, the minds of many
   are a mere blank. This world overspreads their heart with its ten
   thousand characters and reflections. Their faculties are quick and
   practised in all that bears upon this natural and earthly life; but of
   the spiritual world, and of its supernatural order of truths and laws,
   they have but dim and clouded impressions. What wonder if such minds
   turn inwardly upon themselves? They dwell upon their strongest ideas;
   and these are not the ideas of divine and heavenly realities, but of
   their own turbulent and depressing consciousness.

   This is the reason why their prayers are distracted, their communions
   cold, their sense of the Divine pity, love, and pardon, so faint and
   low. What they need is a vivid and habitual perception of the Divine
   Presence and of the mysteries of faith. For this end, it is good for
   them to meditate daily on the love of God, on the gift of His Son and
   of His Spirit; on the Passion of our blessed Lord, on the pledges of
   His miraculous pity, and of His yearning desire of our salvation. And
   such meditations ought not to pass away in mere processes of thought,
   in transient workings of the intellect; but must spread through the
   whole spiritual nature, and issue in acts of faith, hope, and love.
   When I say acts, I do not mean a mere recital of the objects and
   grounds of faith, hope, and love; but such an exercise of the heart and
   will as may awaken a consciousness of personal faith, hope, and love.
   For these are spiritual habits, needing to be trained and disciplined,
   as much as meekness, patience, humility. Nay, far more, inasmuch as
   they are the active powers, the moving energies of the whole spiritual
   life. It is by them God quickens us. They are the threefold working of
   His Spirit in us, uniting us to the Person of His Son, and through Him
   to the kingdom of the Resurrection, and to the Source of everlasting
   life.

SERMON VIII.

  SELF-ACCUSATION.

    ST. LUKE vii. 47.

   "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much."

   THIS passage of our Lord's life, when He sat at meat in the Pharisee's
   house, and the words He spake to Simon and to this penitent sinner, are
   too familiar to need recital. We may therefore turn at once to some of
   the instructions conveyed by this event.

   We see in it a type of His whole kingdom upon earth, of His ministry of
   forgiveness, and of the various spiritual states to be found among His
   servants.

   His words to Simon, though full of tenderness, had a tone of divine
   upbraiding. The Pharisee was no doubt a righteous man; but he had no
   loving and lowly affections. He called Jesus "Master," but he honoured
   Him with a cold, distant propriety. He gave his Master no kiss; he had
   neither ointment for His head, nor water for His feet; and yet the name
   of Simon was not known in the city as a sinner.

   But this poor sullied soul, a by-word among men, had no cold reserve,
   no false shame hiding her true shame; in the sight of all men she broke
   through to the presence of her Master. He had roused her to know her
   misery; He had brought her to repentance and to herself. Her whole
   heart was love, sorrow, and self-accusation. Therefore she received the
   divine words of absolution: "Thy sins be forgiven thee."

   The point to which we may specially direct our attention is this
   self-accusing spirit: its necessity and its blessedness.

   1. For, first of all, it may be said, that the kingdom of Christ is
   founded upon those who accuse themselves of their sins. It has both an
   exterior and an interior foundation; an outer and an inner court. On
   His part it is a perpetual ministry of absolution; on our part, a
   perpetual confession.

   He died that He might absolve all sinners. To dispense the absolution
   purchased in His own blood is His own sovereign prerogative. When on
   earth, He exercised it in person. His words gave perfect pardon both in
   earth and heaven. He said to the penitent, "Thy sins be forgiven thee,"
   and all was blotted out. This was the application of His own redemption
   to individual souls: the in-gathering of the fruit of His own cross and
   passion. And this ministry of forgiveness is of perpetual necessity.

   His absolution from sin is as necessary to all penitent and
   self-accusing sinners now as it was then, and ever will be to the end
   of the world. And He has not ceased to dispense it. His love and pity
   were not dried up when He ascended into heaven. Therefore He left still
   on earth the same power, against which Pharisees and unbelievers
   cavilled, bequeathing their very words to the inheritors of their
   unbelief: "Who can forgive sins but God alone?" He said to His
   Apostles, "As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you:"--that is,
   with the same mission of forgiveness: "All My communicable authority is
   in your trust for the life of the elect,"--"And when He had said this,
   He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
   whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them: and whosesoever
   sins ye retain, they are retained." [52] He thereby entrusted to them
   the prolonged exercise of this His own prerogative. The very same full
   and divine power of absolving all who accuse themselves is in His
   Church now, and shall be till He comes again. This is the great
   commission which includes all besides. He gave to His Apostles the keys
   of the kingdom of heaven; and with them all power to open and shut, to
   bind and loose. Baptism is an exercise of that sovereign power. The
   remission of original sin is a full and plenary application of the
   heavenly keys. Children born into this world of sin are thereby
   admitted into the kingdom of God. So also is the special absolution,
   which, like baptism, is given to individual souls, one by one, on
   distinct and penitent confession: and so too the remission which is
   given in the holy Eucharist, and in other acts of the Church, by which
   lesser sins of incursion and infirmity are forgiven: all these are
   exercises of the one great absolving power which springs from the
   person and the passion of our Lord, and is continued by His presence
   through the hands of His pastors, in every age, until this day. The
   ministry of reconciliation is always at work; the blood of the Good
   Shepherd is ever being applied to the souls for whom He died.

   But this continual absolution on His part demands a continual
   self-accusation on ours; the one is as necessary as the other. And
   therefore it may be truly said, that His kingdom is founded on those
   who accuse themselves. They are its true and enduring foundations. When
   all empty and false Christians shall pass away, they shall be found
   united to Him Who is eternal. The kingdom of Christ descends from
   heaven to earth, having three distinct companies united in one
   fellowship; those who are with Him on high, sinless and unfallen, that
   is, holy angels, who never sinned; another, fallen, but sinless now,
   the spirits of just men made perfect; the third, still on earth, fallen
   and sinful, but repenting and kneeling at the foot of the cross,
   accusing themselves before Him night and day. Such is His kingdom: part
   in heaven now, arrayed in white, and crowned; part waiting upon earth,
   in sackcloth and penance still. This is the Church visible on earth,
   the congregation of the faithful, that is, of the baptised. But baptism
   is an outward grace, which unites penitent and impenitent in one;
   repentance is an inward bond, which unites none but His true servants.
   And of repentance there is one unbending and absolute condition--a true
   self-accusation at the feet of Jesus Christ. There is no exemption from
   this law. Baptism without repentance avails nothing, and repentance
   without self-accusation is impossible. In the midst of the visible
   Church He numbers, by direct intuition, the fellowship of true
   penitents. In them He dwells, and to them He listens. He has no
   communion with those who do not know their need of His absolving pity.
   This law of repentance is laid on all, even on the greatest saints: it
   often seems to press more heavily on them than on others; for as they
   have more sanctity, they have more of love; and as they have more of
   love, they have more of sorrow. As the light rises upon them, they see
   more clearly their own deformities. It is the greatest light of
   sanctity that reveals the least motes of evil; as things imperceptible
   in the common light of day float visible in the sunbeam.

   And if this is true of those in whom our dull eyes see so little amiss,
   how true must it be of ourselves! What ought our whole life to be, but
   a life of self-accusing? Can we come into His presence without
   shrinking? Does not every thing accuse us of sin? God and His holy
   angels, our Lord Jesus Christ and all the company of heaven, our
   fellow-Christians and our fellow-sinners, the accuser of the brethren
   and our own conscience; and if these should hold their peace, the very
   stones would cry out. Our whole life, from childhood, rises up against
   us. Each several age is a distinct witness. Every season, and every
   year, by our whole inward consciousness bears some witness against us.
   Happy for us if we so feel and realise our true state before Him! It is
   a token Who has come to us. It is the absolver coming to convince, that
   He may pardon. When we repent, we are His by a twofold bond. We were
   already His by baptism; we are His now by penance. He has revealed
   Himself to us by faith; He is now revealing us to ourselves by an
   awakened consciousness of sin. He is drawing us within the inner circle
   of His kingdom, where He sits in the tribunal of self-accusation,
   arrayed in the white stole of His eternal priesthood, ever saying, "Thy
   sins be forgiven thee;" "Go, and sin no more."

   2. And this further teaches us that self-accusation is the test which
   separates between true and false repentance. Among the members of the
   visible Church, the faithful and unfaithful may be, for the most part,
   easily distinguished by their open and manifest lives; yet among the
   seemingly faithful, it is not always easy to discern the truly
   converted from those who have never in heart turned to God. Many seem
   to others, and to themselves, to be faithful Christians, who have
   little penitence; and many are believed, and believe themselves, to be
   penitents, who have never truly repented. The one only sure discerning
   test is the spirit of self-accusation.

   Under all the manifold appearances of religion and of repentance, there
   are at last two, and only two, states or postures of mind: the one is
   self-accusation, the other self-defence.

   This runs deep into the conscience and the heart.

   I am not speaking of hypocrites, who live grossly and profess fairly,
   nor of the more palpable forms of irreligion; but of persons outwardly
   blameless, and of strict observance in religion: such, in a word, as
   Simon the Pharisee. Their very freedom from grosser sins generates a
   spirit, which in the world would be called sensitive honour, in
   religion is self-righteousness. Their theory of the Christian life is,
   to be upright, faultless, without soil, without reproach; to have a
   consciousness of their own integrity, justice, and goodness. And such
   they often really are in their dealings towards men. In the outward
   keeping of the second table they seem beyond blame. And yet they fall
   far short in all things towards God,--in love, worship, devotion,
   humility, abasement, repentance, spiritual affections, realisation of
   the sympathy and passion of our Lord, and compunction under the sense
   of a fallen and sinful nature. Their perceptions of God's holiness, of
   the piercing spirituality of His law, and of the malignity of sin, are
   dim and languid. Therefore the consciousness of their own inward state
   is shallow and untrue. Their whole effort is to clear themselves of
   such sins as strike the world's eye; they have little shrinking from
   the eye of God. They believe its universality by an intellectual
   conviction; but they have little feeling of its purity, which is known
   only by a spiritual perception. Moreover, their own inward eye is short
   of sight. And in the consciousness of their hearts they find no
   startling sins. Sinfulness, as distinct from sins of act, is, for their
   conscience, an idea too fine and impalpable. They fall, therefore, into
   a spirit of security, which is a spirit of self-defence. Their
   confessions are close, vague, qualified, and apologetic. They feel no
   need to confess to any but God alone. They think that it is well,
   perhaps, for greater sinners to use special humiliations and special
   helps; but they conceive that they can well enough quiet their own
   conscience with God in secret. I do not say that this may not often be
   true; but no one can deny that it may as often--some will perhaps admit
   oftener--be false. It is strange how dry and unloving such hearts often
   are towards the person of our Lord. There is a cold, exact, judicious,
   and commendable propriety, an avoiding of extremes and emotions of
   enthusiasm and irregularity, which, if there were but life, depth, and
   fervour, would be exemplary. Without these things, they become
   heartless, frigid, and self-complacent.

   It is very difficult to convince such hearts of sin. The searching
   words of a pastor sound to them as reproofs; the lightest noting of
   omissions is taken for rebuke; the gentlest admonition is received as
   charges against their character. Their pastor seems to them as an
   accuser, and they must needs be their own defenders. Who that has had
   the oversight of souls has not known how much of this spirit of
   self-defence lives in the heart even of the good?

   And if it is so with such persons, how much more with the less
   religious, who, the faultier they are, have generally a more vivid
   spirit of self-defence! How sullen, estranged, and full of offence they
   grow, when faithfully admonished; and how dangerous and useless is such
   a spirit! How useless, because it is but a little while, and a deathbed
   or the day of judgment will force them to behold their very selves. How
   dangerous, because there is no greater slight and provocation of the
   majesty of God. Nothing so deafens the ear against both warnings and
   promises, nothing so hinders the influx of divine grace, and so
   estranges the heart from the pastors of Christ. Instead of friends,
   guides, physicians, comforters, they become censors and accusers. The
   whole heart and will is turned away from them. We become pursuers of
   the unwilling, not receivers of the willing and penitent. It is the
   habitual thought and care of these self-defenders to elude their
   pastor's eye, and to conceal their festering wounds. Self-defenders fly
   from his sight and voice, as self-accusers seek it. The whole tide of
   the soul is turned in the wrong direction. And the minister of
   reconciliation waits, in sadness and silence, till the heart, knowing
   at last its own plague, opens of its own accord. This is the sure
   discerning test which separates the penitent from the impenitent in the
   interior court of Christ's kingdom.

   3. And hence we see that the true source of this self-accusing spirit
   is love. A heart once touched by the love of Christ no longer strives
   to hide its sin, or to make it out to be but little. To excuse,
   palliate, or lighten the guilt even of a little sin grates upon the
   whole inward sense of sorrow and self-abasement. "Against Thee, Thee
   only," is the language of true penitents. The wrong done to God and the
   hardness towards our crucified Lord are their chief motives to
   repentance. They have no peace but in laying their sins to their own
   charge. The remembrance of sin makes them to feel ungenerous and
   heartless. They have nothing left but to turn accusers of themselves;
   to take part against themselves before the tribunal of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. They come with a forward and earnest will, to lay open their
   own grief, and to bear their own shame; for in their conscience there
   is a presence which opens them from within. He that entered when the
   doors were shut, passes within their heart; and the iron gate, so
   close, heavy, and impenetrable, opens of its own accord. Their sorrow
   is not turbulent, clouded, and unquiet, as the sorrow of self
   -justifying minds when they are detected and reproved, but gentle and
   soft, with a brightness even in its shadows. It is a sadness which
   humbles and sanctifies, making the will pliant, and even the words of
   self-accusing to be sweet. "While I held my tongue, my bones consumed
   away through my daily complaining; for Thy hand is heavy upon me day
   and night, and my moisture is like the drought in summer. I will
   acknowledge my sin unto Thee, and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
   I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord; and so Thou forgavest the
   wickedness of my sin." [53] So long as we defend ourselves, God accuses
   us, and we go heavily all the day long, our hearts glowing and
   smouldering within: so soon as we accuse ourselves at His feet, God and
   all the powers of His kingdom shelter and defend us. This is our true
   solace and relief.

   Now there are two signs by which we shall know whether our confessions
   are the self-accusations of penitent and loving hearts.

   The first is, that our confessions be humble. The Pharisee, in the
   parable, stood and prayed with himself, as separate from the common
   herd: Simon invited his Master, and sat at meat with Him. Many give
   thanks, not for what God has made them, but for what they are; and bid
   themselves to their Lord's presence, "feasting themselves without
   fear." They confess, pray, communicate, as a matter of right and
   undoubted freedom; never staying to ask, Am I meet to draw near? am I
   worthy that He should come under my roof? The words of Peter, "Depart
   from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord," perplex them; they think them
   contradictory and unmeaning: they desire His presence, and they think
   that enough. Not so he that "stood afar off, and smote upon his
   breast," accusing himself in the sight of God and man; not so she that
   had no care or consciousness of cavilling eyes, kneeling at her
   Redeemer's feet. This is one sure sign of a true penitent: a
   willingness to be humbled, to bear shame before man as well as before
   God; to go alone into the presence of men and angels, with no excuses
   or diminutions, no inculpations of others, or mitigating pleas. "Every
   man must bear his own burden," when the secrets of all hearts shall be
   revealed; and a humble confession strives to. anticipate that hour of
   isolated trial, and to fall down alone, as guilty above all, before the
   judgment-seat of Christ.

   The other sign is, that it be an honest self-accusing. And to this
   honesty it is essential that we should use a moral diligence, that is,
   a sincere, careful, and leisurely attention to remember and to recount
   the sins of our past life and of our present state.

   It is plain, indeed, that no man can recall the whole tissue and train
   of his past life; no human memory can store it up, no human
   consciousness can sustain it. Therefore it is enough that we confess
   all we can remember, according to these three rules.

   First, the kind of our sins: not in vague general terms, such as, "I am
   proud," or "I am angry," and the like; but specifically accusing
   ourselves of the instances in which we have so offended.

   Secondly, we must confess the number of our sins: not strictly every
   act, which is impossible, but morally; that is, whether they have been
   isolated events, or frequent and habitual.

   And lastly, the circumstances which may change the character, or
   aggravate the sinfulness of what we have done: as, for instance, the
   persons against whom we have offended; for an act of disrespect is far
   guiltier if committed against a parent than against an indifferent
   person: and the time; for sins derive a peculiar character from the
   season; as, if we sinned after great warnings, or in the midst of great
   blessings or chastisements. And again, the manner, that is, whether
   deliberately, and with mature intentions; for even lesser sins have
   greater guilt when they are committed with slighter outward temptation,
   and therefore with stronger inward sinfulness; or whether against
   motions to forbear; or persisted in after the moment of temptation, by
   the obstinacy of a perverse heart. These plain rules will be enough for
   a sincere conscience; for where the will is right, rules are but little
   needed.

   Humility and honesty, then, are the two sure signs of a sincere
   self-accuser: where these are, we may be strong in hope that the grace
   of a loving and penitent heart has been bestowed by the Spirit of God.

   How pitiful and tender is this great ministry of peace! All that the
   Absolver demands of us is, that we kneel down before Him and condemn
   ourselves. What miracles of Divine compassion are working day by day!
   Throughout His whole Church on earth the Blood of atonement is
   perpetually descending,--sins are perpetually blotted out for ever,
   hearts cleansed for eternity. There is a strange contrast between the
   outer and the inner courts of His temple. Some who seem nearest to the
   kingdom of God are farthest off; such as the unhumbled, unconvinced,
   who dissemble, and profess; pray, and live without a law upon their
   will; communicate, and have no shrinking when their unworthiness meets
   His searching presence: and such too as are impatient of a law or a
   truth above themselves; self-flatterers and fearless; the lordly
   spirits who walk erect, ruling, criticising, judging, and pronouncing
   judgments in His Church and at His altars, on His faith, sacraments,
   and servants. Verily, "many that are first shall be last."

   In like manner, there are those who seem afar off, but are nearest,
   even already within the threshold of His kingdom; for sinners with
   compunction are nearer to Him than the righteous without humility.
   "Publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before" Scribes and
   Pharisees. The world believes none of these things. It knows what
   penitents once were; for it is keen-eyed and retentive. It remembers
   their wanderings and scandals j but it has no spiritual discernment to
   read the conversion of a soul. The world rebukes self-accusers as
   shameless, unmanly, wanting in self-respect, and believes them still to
   be what they are now no longer. But there is One who knows all,--at
   whose feet they daily kneel. He has seen all by His divine intuition.
   He has heard all in His patient ear of mercy. Go, then, to Him
   continually; never suffering a sin to sink unconfessed into the
   heart,--for harboured sins soon fester, and one sin "will eat as doth a
   canker," infecting the whole soul. Fear Him not, for He is pity. Only
   lay open your grief to Him, and the blood of sprinkling shall come
   down. He will bind up your oldest and sorest wounds. Believe in your
   absolution as a point of faith. Draw near to Him, morning and night,
   especially as you approach the altar, and there, before Him, lift up
   your eyes to His heavenly throne. Whom do you behold surrounding Him on
   every side? A great company of saints now,--a little while ago a great
   company of penitents; humbled and self-accusing here on earth,--now
   spotless as Himself.

SERMON IX.

  THE ANALOGY OF NATURE.

    1 COR. xv. 35-38.

   "But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body
   do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened,
   except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body
   that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other
   grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to every
   seed his own body."

   THIS is St. Paul's answer to objections against the resurrection of the
   body. The objector took his stand upon supposed impossibilities. "How
   are the dead raised up?"--as if death were extinction; "and with what
   body do they come?"--as if corruption were annihilation. St. Paul's
   answer is drawn, not from faith, but from nature. "Death," he says, "is
   a condition of life. Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not
   quickened, except it die.' Death does not extinguish the seed; it must
   die before it can be quickened. And thou sowest not that body that
   shall be, but bare grain.' The change or corruption of the seed is not
   annihilation, but the germination of a new form, a more perfect
   structure, the blade, the stalk, and the ear. Nature refutes your
   fancied impossibility by her perpetual facts. The resurrection is
   before your eyes. You believe it already. Nature has her resurrection
   as well as grace; both are kingdoms of God, and His omnipotence is in
   both alike. There is a relation of virtue and power, as between seed
   and fruit, so between the body sown and the body that shall be raised
   from the dead."

   Such is St. Paul's argument. He does not prove by miracle; he does not
   cite revelations; he does not appeal to faith; and that for two
   reasons: first, he is only answering objections; and next, the very
   thing to be proved was the fact of a miraculous revelation itself. He
   therefore says with great energy, "Why object to the resurrection of
   the dead?--the very world rebukes you. O foolish, the seed of the field
   dies, that it may rise again."

   Now we will consider, not the particular subject of St. Paul's
   controversy, the resurrection of the body, but the form of his
   argument, which we are wont to call the analogy of nature. It is of
   great moment that we should well understand its use; for no argument is
   so strong within its sphere, and none more fatal if pressed too far.
   Within its legitimate range, it makes nature divine; when pushed
   beyond, it reduces faith to a natural religion.

   Let us see, then, how far it is good, and when it becomes bad. The
   argument from analogy is good and unanswerable:

   1. First, when it is used, as by St. Paul in this place, to refute
   objections. It is plainly absurd to argue against revelation, or any
   specific doctrines of revelation, on the ground of difficulties and
   supposed impossibilities, the like of which may be found already to
   exist in the acknowledged facts of nature. When we say the like, it is
   plain we mean the like in proportion and relation, not in individual
   properties or specific kind; for instance, a seed is not like a human
   body, nor a furrow like a grave; nor an ear of corn like our flesh
   glorified. But the terms are related in the two processes, and have a
   proportion each to each: they run in parallel. As the seed is to the
   ear, so is the corruptible body to the incorruptible; and as the furrow
   to the wheat, so is the grave to our flesh. Now it is undeniable, that
   this is an argument which puts unbelievers, if they persist, out of the
   pale of reason. They are outlawed from revelation and philosophy, from
   faith and fact. The same argument is good in defence of many other
   doctrines of the Gospel, such as future judgment, reward and
   punishment, moral probation, and the like. Whatever unbelievers may
   say, they are already, in the order of nature, subject to the very same
   laws. Do what they will, go where they may, they cannot escape; nature,
   as they call it, will deal with them and dispose of them according to
   the very same laws as revelation. These laws are facts in nature as
   well as doctrines of the Gospel. All this is solid reasoning, beyond
   the subtilty of objection to undo. It clears away at a sweep the
   supposed preliminary objections to this or that doctrine of the faith.

   But a still further use may be made of this argument. Hitherto it has
   been treated by way of refutation only, as by St. Paul in the text, to
   answer objections; but it may be used to some extent affirmatively
   also. The correspondence between the facts of nature and the doctrines
   of the faith forms a strong presumption that both come from one
   author,--the marks of the same hand are visible in both. We must bear
   in mind, that in this use of analogy we employ it no further than as
   raising a presumption. For, in arguing with unbelievers, the very point
   at issue is, whether the faith be a true revelation or not; that is,
   whether it come from God. Believers may invert the argument, and say,
   "He who believes the Scripture to have proceeded from Him who is the
   author of nature, may well expect to find the same sort of difficulties
   in it as are found in the constitution of nature." [54] But in arguing
   with unbelievers this is to beg the question. The point to be proved
   is, that the faith comes from God. If they admitted this, the analogy
   of nature would prepare them for mysteries which would be difficulties
   no longer, but facts in the faith, as these visible facts may be called
   doctrines of the natural world. But this is the point they do not
   admit. They meet us with a direct contradiction. We cannot, therefore,
   take it for granted. We must open our way to it; we must clear the path
   of approach. The hindrances which bar it up are these supposed
   impossibilities, to which nature offers an analogy, and therefore
   provides a reply. They are not impossible; for we see that they
   actually exist. And this point being gained, the tide of the argument
   turns the other way. What was simple refutation becomes a presumptive
   proof. We may now say, "You cannot deny these facts in nature: you
   acknowledge that nature is from God: the faith is so far a counterpart
   of nature, bears the same features, the tokens of one and the same
   hand: how can you deny that the faith too is from God?" This is not
   offered as a positive or constructive proof. It is a strong
   presumption, a high probability; but revelation awaits its own proper
   evidence. It does but reduce the assailant to his defence, and throws
   the burden upon the objector.

   We may go one step further still. The visible coincidence between the
   facts of nature and the doctrines of faith, so far as we can observe
   them, make it probable that the same coincidence may exist beyond our
   range of observation: just as the coincidence of any complex figures,
   seen in part, leads to a presumption that the correspondence may run
   throughout. And this, perhaps, was in the thoughts of the son of Sirach
   when he said, "All things are double one against another, and He hath
   made nothing imperfect." [55] But it is plain without a word, that such
   a hypothesis is no more than a presumption, formed beforehand, and
   without proof or evidence. Of this, however, we may better speak
   hereafter.

   Thus far, then, the argument from analogy is irresistible. It clears
   away supposed objections by fact; it raises a probability that
   revelation is, like nature, the work of God; and that the analogy we
   trace in part, may extend beyond our range of observation. Thus far it
   invests nature with a divine character, and makes it the basis of the
   faith. It consecrates the visible world as a type and sacrament of the
   unseen; and so throughout holy Scripture we find it regarded. St. Paul
   convicts the heathen of vincible ignorance; "because that which may be
   known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For
   the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly
   seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal
   power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse." [56] In like
   manner, again, he spoke at Lystra. [57] And the whole use of natural
   illustrations in the language of metaphor is founded upon the same
   implied presumption. But, after all, the sum of the case is this: the
   argument from analogy, in its refutative form, is absolute: in its
   constructive it is only a presumption; clearing the way for the
   positive and proper evidence of the point at issue.

   2. And this leads us to notice shortly in what form this analogical way
   of reasoning is bad and destructive.

   Every body will at once, and at first sight, acknowledge, that it would
   be mere infidelity to take the analogy of nature as the measure or
   limit of revelation. For this, in fact, has been the normal argument of
   free-thinkers. In the last century, the phrase Christianity as old as
   the creation' became an axiom and a watchword. And among rationalists
   it is a favourite idea, that so much of Christianity as they are
   pleased to believe resides implicitly in the human consciousness, and
   has been evolved from it. Now if this form of argument be examined, it
   will be found ultimately to rest on an abuse of the analogy of nature
   and revelation. A likeness of observed proportions being pressed beyond
   its range, leads to an assumed coincidence; as if nature were a
   counterpart of the faith--a sort of material and visible exhibition
   upon a lower scale, and with relation to temporal ends, of the same
   agencies and laws. These supposed counterparts soon run into a supposed
   identity, and the faith sinks into a mere natural religion; or, to use
   words which have become technical, supernaturalism merges in
   naturalism.

   We must take care therefore, lest, without intending it, we really lend
   our help in this direction.

   There is also another and a very common misuse of this great form of
   argument. People who would at once see the manifest falsehood of
   avowedly using the analogy of nature as the limit of revelation, are
   often not aware that they effectively do the same thing when they
   employ it to prescribe the manner and kind of the Divine procedure
   within the precincts of the revelation they receive. This will be
   better made clear by examples.

   For instance, it is observed that the nature of man is one, and common
   to the whole race: all partake in it, and all are therefore
   consubstantial; but this unity is consistent with an all but infinite
   multitude of persons. This seems to be a direct confirmation of the
   mystery of the Holy Trinity. It need not be said that this analogy, if
   pressed too far, would establish Tritheism.

   Suppose, to escape this, the analogy of the perfect unity of powers in
   the individual soul be assumed. It then issues in Sabellianism.

   The analogy of human paternity and human sonship directly proves the
   Arian doctrine.

   But this will be admitted at once. Let us take other examples.

   We find, then, that the race of mankind has no common language, no
   common polity, no unity of relations either of equality or of
   government; that families, as they multiply, perpetually subdivide, and
   nations expand till they cast off colonies and hostile empires; that,
   in fact, the whole analogy of nature and providence establishes the law
   of individual and national development--of a radical unity, with no one
   visible form or organic polity. Therefore the analogy of God's actual
   dealings is thought to be opposed to the theory of visible unity in a
   polity of Divine institution, or, in other words, to the visible unity
   of the Church.

   Again, the testimony of all mankind agrees as to the certainty of
   evidence based on personal experience, such as eye-witness, and the
   uncertainty of any thing which seems at variance with the evidence of
   sense; therefore the holy sacraments are sacred symbols, to be received
   reverently, but in themselves still continue, to the last, without any
   change, or supernatural element beyond the sphere of sense.

   Or, once more: We find that the inclination of mankind by nature has
   universally tended to corrupt the truth originally received, and that
   the clear sight of truth has been restored, from time to time, only by
   the intelligence of individuals; therefore the traditions of
   Christendom are human corruptions of a Divine element, and the
   corrective tests are the critical powers of the individual reason.

   And lastly, it may be said: We find that it has pleased God to ordain
   our probation on laws which often involve many doubtful questions and
   balanced probabilities as to duty and truth; and so we find also that
   Christianity is not universal; that its evidences are peculiar both in
   measure and kind; that they are not the strongest possible even to all
   those to whom it is actually revealed; that the quantity and quality of
   evidence are part of our probation, to some men perhaps especially;
   that, as certainty is found nowhere in nature, it is not to be demanded
   in revelation; that a measure of uncertainty, that is, of probability,
   is involved in the idea of moral trial, and that the facts of nature
   shew us on what laws revealed truth is to be sought and held; and that
   therefore the whole analogy of our condition is opposed to the
   supposition of an unerring witness preserving and propounding truth by
   Divine appointment in the Church.

   Now, with whatsoever force and seeming probability these propositions
   may be maintained, they are one and all examples of one and the same
   fallacy. They not only use the analogy of nature antecedently to the
   proper proof, so as to prescribe à priori the manner in which the
   Divine revelation has been put and left, but ultimately even against
   it. In fact, they are but the fine end of naturalism. The principle
   carried out is "Christianity as old as the creation." The revelation
   based upon it is only a heap of Christian facts, without unity,
   coherence, or procession from any supernatural idea.

   The force of analogy is here assumed to be positive and constructive,
   and that too in matters beyond its sphere. It is as if we should argue,
   that because the earth is a planet, describes an elliptical orbit round
   the sun, is spherical in form, and revolves on an axis, therefore the
   other planets, in which all these conditions are equally fulfilled, are
   in all other conditions like the earth; for instance, inhabited and by
   a fallen race, and endowed with no higher functions or conditions;
   that, in a word, they are as our earth is, and transcend it in nothing.
   Now it is scientifically true that this analogy raises a high amount of
   probability; and until the positive and proper evidence can be brought
   to shew that it has pleased God to endow other worlds more highly than
   our own, this analogy is master of the field. It has no antagonist:
   high probability is, in this case, our highest proof, and, as a
   presumption, no one can gainsay it. But here is exactly the point where
   false analogies fail. The planets can put in no proper evidence for
   themselves, but revelation can and does.

   In truth, as has been said by a great master of analogy, we can be no
   judges of the wisdom of God in the order we find established in the
   world; and nothing but the knowledge of another world, [58] to which we
   might compare it, would give us the criteria of such a judgment. We
   must take it as we find it a sole and ultimate fact in itself. So with
   revelation: the nearest analogy we have is that of nature; but nothing
   can give us either the grounds on which to measure, or the criteria by
   which to judge it, except another revelation, with which it may be
   compared. Nature follows by its side a little way, till revelation
   transcends its sphere: the world is natural; revelation, by its very
   term, a supernatural world. We must receive it in its own light and
   upon its own proper proofs. Let us, therefore, turn our thoughts for a
   while to those proofs, and then conclude.

   1. What, then, is this proper evidence on which revelation, or, as we
   shall better say henceforth, the Church and the Faith, repose? Plainly,
   upon no presumptions or probabilities deduced before the fact, that is,
   upon no à priori reasoning. We are not able to say before the fact
   whether any revelation shall be given or not; or, if given, to what
   extent, to what end, on what evidence, or how secured, and the like. In
   this, nature is silent as death. Analogies have no existence. All our
   proofs are after the event. The fact attests itself, and reveals its
   own outline, character, and conditions. In the beginning, God revealed
   Himself to the patriarchs by visions and tokens of His Divine presence.
   That was their revelation and its evidences. It needed no analogies,
   and would accept of none. Abraham at Mamre, Jacob at Bethel, Moses in
   Horeb, Israel in the wilderness, Aaron in the tabernacle, Joshua by
   Jericho, Gideon at the oak in Ophrah, all the hierarchy of Israel, the
   seers and the prophets, and the whole family of the chosen
   tribes,--what proofs, what evidences, what analogies had they, or
   needed they, to prove that God was with them as their Light and their
   Sanctifier?

   And just so has it been with the Church of Christ. The Word was made
   flesh; the elect saw Him in the temple; He was manifested at His
   baptism; He chose out, first twelve to be with Him, and then seventy;
   He wrought miracles, taught, suffered, rose again, went up into heaven,
   shed abroad the Holy Ghost, knit together His mystical Body, gave life
   to it by His own presence in the Holy Spirit. What analogies of nature
   cast so much as a shadow of these things? so much as a faint
   probability of the miraculous conception, the incarnation of the
   Eternal Son, the descent, presence, inspiration of the Holy Ghost?
   Plainly the whole argument from analogy is but as a sign "for them that
   believe not." It is for those that are without. It is not the
   children's bread, nor has it any place before the Shechinah. The
   supernatural inspiration of the Church is a perpetual illumination
   above the laws of nature. Its conditions, limits, and modes of
   operation are all its own. The fact of Christendom, the miracle of the
   visible Church, the supernatural traditions of the heavenly
   kingdom,--these are the proper evidences to those that are within the
   fold of Christ. These, and these only, reveal the laws and the manner
   of God's dealing with us through His incarnate Son. Within the sphere
   of a miracle as wide as the world, to be told of natural laws ought in
   itself to be warning enough--"Take these things hence." Is there any
   part of the new creation that is not supernatural? Is not even its
   earthly basis at once above nature by the gift of regeneration?

   Because our human personality divides the unity of substance, must,
   therefore, the divine? Because our individuality admits of no more than
   one personal subsistence, can there be no distinction of Persons in the
   Godhead? Because among men the father is before the son, cannot the
   everlasting Son be co-eternal with the Father? Because the old creation
   is fallen and divided, may not the new have an unity derived from
   heaven? Because sense rules in the world, may there not be sacraments
   in the Church? Because human traditions grow corrupt, may not divine
   traditions be kept pure? Because keen intellects rule among human
   reasoners, are they to be instructors of the Saints? Because natural
   truth is an uncertain light, may not the light of Christ be sustained
   by Himself infallible and clear? Surely all this is nothing less than
   to take nature without revelation as the measure and limit of Christ's
   presence and office in the Church. What is the Church of Christ in its
   first idea, but a supernatural economy, an order above nature; a
   creation which is in itself a miracle, in which the course of its
   proper nature is miraculous? By the very hypothesis, the analogies of
   this fallen world are excluded. And yet, when I say excluded, I do not
   say violated or transgressed. They are satisfied in full; they are
   satisfied to exhaustion, and beyond; as fully as the laws of our
   humanity were fulfilled in the person of our Lord, which was also
   divine, and in His unearthly perfection after He rose from the dead.
   While He fulfilled, He transcended all our conditions. "It is I Myself;
   handle Me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me
   have." He was all He had been, and more besides: all that He had put
   off was infirmity. So, in its measure, with the Church. It complies
   with all the true and divine analogies of nature; it exhausts, and goes
   beyond them all. Nature has laws of probation, reward, punishment,
   moral discipline, and the like; so had the law of Moses; but our Lord
   said, "I am come, not to destroy the law, but to fulfil." Nature was
   exalted into the elder covenant, and the law ascended into the Gospel:
   it went up "from strength to strength," "from glory to glory." We are
   under an economy above nature, miraculous and heavenly. The idea and
   principles, the laws, limits, and conditions of the kingdom of Christ
   in the revelation and perpetuity of truth, in the effusion and
   distribution of grace, are as far above the reach of natural analogies
   as heaven is above earth. In what do they begin, in what are they
   continued, but in a series of supernatural facts, in original
   revelations, in spiritual consciousness, in the words of inspired
   Scripture, in apostolical traditions, in the testimony of the Church,
   in the definitions of Councils, in the collective discernment of men
   sanctified by the Spirit of God? In every one of these there is an
   element of which nature has no counterpart or analogy. It is only after
   all these that we come to the region of this world; to the judgments of
   philosophers, the labours of critics, the deductions of reasoning, and
   the testimony of uninspired histories. Such, then, is the proper and
   positive evidence on which the faith is built.

   2. And lastly, let us consider, What is the proper faculty or
   instrument by which the truth is to be apprehended? The whole word of
   God answers at once, By faith. Let us only remember how the revelation
   of God was given. Was it discovered by investigation, or was it simply
   received from heaven? There is no third way to arrive at the original
   truth: it is either by discovery or by reception; either, that is, by
   reasoning or by faith. How, then, was it given? To the prophets, by the
   inspiration of God; to the Apostles, by the descent of the Holy Ghost,
   by the presence and guidance of Christ. And that gift which was
   received by faith has been, by the Spirit of Christ, perpetuated
   through faith. It was not first given, then left to be discovered;
   first consigned to faith, then to be proved by reason. It brought its
   own proof: the inspiration of Apostles became illumination in the
   Church. The illumination of the Holy Ghost is as perpetual as His
   presence. His office is, as His presence, "for ever;" that is, unto the
   end of the world. Did any Christian ever doubt that both "grace and
   truth," which came by Jesus Christ, are necessary for our salvation?
   And has any one ever imagined that the Holy Spirit has ceased to
   sanctify Christ's body? Did He sanctify the Apostles and first
   believers, and then leave the family of Christ, for all ages, to work
   out their salvation by moral habits and the force of nature? And if
   this be as impious as incredible, does He continue to sanctify, but not
   to illuminate? Does His presence sustain the stream of grace, and not
   sustain the stream of truth? If the Church is not thrown upon its mere
   moral powers for sanctity, is it thrown upon its mere intellectual
   powers for doctrine? Surely the traditions of grace and the traditions
   of truth are both sustained by the same perpetual and infallible
   presence. Is it possible to believe that the supernatural illumination
   of the Spirit was so given as to rest upon no higher base than reason,
   discovery, criticism, and analogies of nature? "Are ye so foolish?
   having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?" [59]
   What is moral evidence, of which so much is said? It is the highest
   probability which can be attained in matters where there is no manifest
   certainty in the object, and no higher light than the light of nature
   in the subject. Suppose the natural light of the individual mind to be
   aided in some general way by grace: even then, at the highest, moral
   evidence is only probable; that is, uncertain both in the subject and
   in the object. Is it possible to believe that this scheme of
   probabilities (that is, of uncertainty) in doctrine, and imperfection
   (that is, of doubt) in evidence, is a part of the probation of the
   regenerate within the revelation of the faith? Because to unbelievers
   the nature and quality of the proof is a trial of faith, as the mission
   of our Lord was to the Jews, are we to suppose that probable evidence
   was a part of the trial of the Apostles after the descent of the Holy
   Ghost? And if not of the Apostles, was it to those who heard them? For
   instance, is it a part of the trial of the Church to hold the doctrine
   of the Trinity, the Incarnation, the holy Sacraments, the Resurrection,
   upon probable evidence? Surely we are mistaking the very meaning of
   faith. Faith means trust in a divine authority. The trust we repose in
   human authority and reasoning may be called faith by an analogy which
   invests it with a dignity above its own: it is a human and earthly type
   of a divine gift: just as we speak of natural religion, or the
   revelations of nature. But faith is an infused grace of God, by which
   the soul casts its whole confidence upon the authority of God. The
   infallibility of God is the foundation of that trust. The infallibility
   of the Church is made up of these two elements; perfect certainty in
   the object revealed, and spiritual illumination in the subject which
   perceives it, that is, the Church itself. Shake this foundation, and
   faith becomes uncertainty; and what is uncertainty, as a rule of life
   or as a principle of action? the best, indeed, that nature can give in
   most things, but the least truth in the kingdom of God is greater than
   it. What gives to faith its confidence of trust, its enduring strength
   in action, its intense insight in contemplation? Certainty founded on
   revelation. And what is the very first idea of revelation but a clear
   and infallible knowledge of the truth given direct from God?

   Now it is no answer to this to ask, But how many attain to such a
   certainty? This is only the objection urged against the Gospel by
   free-thinkers from without the Church, namely, its want of
   universality. It is no objection against either the universality of
   redemption, or the infallibility of the Church. What has been said
   amounts to this: that the doctrines of the faith, fully and clearly
   revealed by inspiration in the beginning, were fully and clearly
   apprehended by the Church; that the original inspiration has descended
   in a perpetual illumination; that this divine gift, as it was, at the
   first, not discovered but received, so it has been, not critically
   proved, from age to age, by intellect, not gathered by inductions or by
   the instruments of moral reasoning, but preserved and handed on by
   faith; that the office of reason is, not to discover and attain, but to
   illustrate, demonstrate, and expound; that the perpetual preservation
   of truth is a part of the divine office of the Holy Ghost, ever present
   in the mystical body of Christ; and that the presence of an infallible
   Teacher is as necessary to the infirmities of the human reason, as the
   presence of an omnipotent Comforter is necessary to the infirmities of
   the human will; that both the will and the reason, without such a
   presence, omnipotent and infallible, would be in bondage to evil and to
   falsehood. This miraculous and supernatural gift was promised through
   the prophets. "As for Me, this is My covenant with them, saith the
   Lord; My spirit that is upon them, and My words which I have put in thy
   mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy
   seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from
   henceforth and for ever." [60]

   And this promise was renewed and fulfilled by the Word made flesh. "The
   Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My
   name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
   remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you." [61] "When He, the
   Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He
   shall not speak of Himself: but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He
   speak: and He will shew you things to come." [62] "Ye have an unction
   from the Holy One, and ye know all things." [63] "The anointing which
   ye have received of Him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man
   teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is
   truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in
   Him." [64] "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."
   [65]

   I have dwelt the longer upon this particular example, because it may be
   taken as the most exalted form in which the revelation of God
   transcends the presumptions and analogies of nature. Before it was
   revealed, how unimaginable was the incarnation of the Son of God, the
   descent and perpetual indwelling of the Holy Ghost! how exuberant of
   supernatural mysteries, how fruitful in Divine ministries of grace!
   Since the fall, there had been one heavy downward tide bearing mankind
   away from God: perpetuity, steadfastness, growth of sanctity, except in
   scattered saints, was nowhere seen. Even the elder Church was but a
   shadow of good things to come, though, through all its visible
   declensions, it preserved its elect, and the promise of Messiah. "As a
   teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast
   their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof." [66]
   And this prophecy, though the teil tree and the oak are types and
   illustrations, was fulfilled by a divine person and a divine production
   above the analogies of nature; by the mystical unity of Christ and the
   Church.

   Let us, then, while we trace the unity and harmony of all God's works,
   both in nature and in grace, beware how we limit the manifold fulness
   of the Divine procedure. All the creation of God reveals itself upon an
   ascending scale, a mystical ladder, the foot of which rests on this
   lower earth; but as we climb upward, new and more perfect ministries,
   laws of a heavenlier tenor, begin to move and reign; as subjects of the
   city of God, we pass under conditions of probation, guidance, light,
   grace, and sustenance, of which nature gives the prelude and the hope,
   but the realities are transcendent and eternal.

SERMON X.

  THE NEW CREATION.

    REV. iii. 14.

   "These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
   beginning of the creation of God."

   BY these divine titles our Lord made Himself known to the Church of
   Laodicea. They have each one of them a deep and ineffable meaning, far
   beyond the reach of our intelligence. He is the eternal,
   self-affirming, self-attesting Truth; the changeless revelation of the
   unchangeable wisdom; the fulness of the promises; "the beginning," and
   first producing cause, "of the creation of God."

   It is of this last title we have now to speak. Let us consider,
   therefore, why He is so called.

   And first, the Son of God is so called because He was Himself the
   creator of all worlds.

   In the book of Proverbs we read of the Word or Wisdom of the Father:
   "The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His way, before His works of
   old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
   earth was. When there were no depths I was brought forth; when there
   were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were
   settled, before the hills was I brought forth: while as yet He had not
   made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the
   world. When He prepared the heavens, I was there: when He set a compass
   upon the face of the depth: when He established the clouds above: when
   He strengthened the fountains of the deep: when He gave to the sea His
   decree, that the waters should not pass His commandment: when He
   appointed the foundations of the earth: then I was by Him, as one
   brought up with Him: and I was daily His delight, rejoicing always
   before Him." [67] Again, in the book of Psalms: "By the Word of the
   Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of
   His mouth." [68] The beloved disciple writes: "In the beginning was the
   Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. . . . . All
   things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that
   was made." [69] And St. Paul writes: "Who is the image of the invisible
   God, the first-born of every creature: for by Him were all things
   created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
   invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
   powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him: and He is before
   all things, and by Him all things consist." [70] And again: "His Son,
   whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the
   worlds." [71] And so the Church confesses in the Nicene creed, "God of
   God, Light of Light, very God of very God," "by whom all things were
   made."

   From these words we learn that the creator of the world is the
   everlasting Son of God. The Word of God is He by whom "He spake, and it
   was done: He commanded, and it stood fast." He said, "Let there be
   light: and there was light." That same almighty and eternal Word is not
   a mere effluence, or emanation, or radiance of the Father, but a divine
   Person, consubstantial, distinct, but undivided,--the Power of
   creation, as voice is the power of speech,--true, living, almighty.
   Thus He was the beginning, the first moving cause, making that to be
   which was not, shaping and moulding it after the forms of His own
   eternal wisdom; ordering, harmonising, uniting all things; filling,
   quickening, upholding all things. All creation was a visible revealing
   of the divine Word. He was in all things, clothing Himself with His
   creatures; imaging Himself forth in wisdom, goodness, and power. All
   orders of being, visible and invisible, had their life in Him who was
   "the Life," the sustaining bond of their life and unity. This is one,
   and the first, sense of this divine title.

   2. Again, He is the beginning of the creation of God, as the first
   cause or principle of its restoration. After the world had fallen from
   Him, and was at war with Him, the same power of endless life, out of
   which in the beginning they first arose into being, became a power of
   healing and restoration. There is a mysterious law which pervades the
   creatures of this fallen world, healing over and smoothing out even the
   scars of their wounds. So is He in the creation of God. He is the power
   of health and restoration, renewing all things. Before the fall of man,
   this mystery of restoration was conceived in heaven, though the voice
   was not heard for long ages upon earth: "Behold, I make all things
   new." The beginning of the new creation was even then at work. "Known
   unto God are all His works from the beginning." Time is not, with Him.
   Though His divine purposes are unfolded and fulfilled in time, with Him
   they are already perfect in order and fulness. In the first four
   thousand years of the world the Son of God was preparing all things to
   unfold the great mystery of the new creation. He spake with man by the
   ministry of angels, and intermingled with the earthly life of His
   chosen people. He spake with Abraham when the burning lamp passed
   between the sacrifices, and with Moses at the unconsuming bush in
   Horeb; He journeyed in the midst of Israel in the wilderness; He put
   His Spirit on prophets and seers, until the fulness of time came, that
   the Word should be made flesh and dwell among us, and that men should
   behold His glory. This was the first act of the new creation. By the
   mystery of the Incarnation it began to be, and the Word made flesh is
   "the Beginning."

   As the first Adam, who was by creation the son of God, was made of the
   virgin earth, so the second Adam, the only-begotten Son of the Father,
   was made man of a virgin mother. The first miraculous birth of the dust
   of the earth was a shadow of the second miraculous birth of the
   substance of the woman. Our manhood, which in the fall of the first man
   was marred and sullied, He took in all its sinless infirmities in will,
   conscience, and affections; and He bare it in all its measures and
   ages, of childhood, youth, and manhood. He hallowed it, and filled it
   with the Divine presence, and reconsecrated it to God. In it He died,
   and laid it in the rock, and bare it through the valley of the shadow
   of death; raised it from the dead; exalted it above the conditions of
   matter; of a natural body, made it to be a spiritual body; carried it
   upward to the holiest of all, and arrayed it in glory at the right hand
   of God. Such is the mystery of the Incarnation, as now perfected in the
   kingdom of heaven. It is the restoration of our manhood to God in the
   Person of Jesus Christ. But as the first creation was not a single and
   final, but a sustained and continuous act, so also is the second. As in
   the first was contained the multiplication and increase of all germs of
   nature and the perpetual preservation of the whole order of life, so in
   the new, which is the mystical body of the Son, He began a new family
   of man upon the earth.

   In the mystery of the Incarnation is contained, therefore, the mystery
   of our renewal, in body, soul, and spirit, to the image of God. Our
   Lord Jesus Christ is the principle and power, and, as it were, the root
   of the new creation. We are so united to His incarnate nature, as to be
   incorporated and summed up in Him: we are made one with Him, as by our
   natural lineage we are one with the first Adam, the father of all
   flesh. When He ascended up on high, the virtues of His glorified
   manhood were shed abroad upon His Church. Through His holy Sacraments
   began a new line of spiritual generation. We are new-born, or
   regenerated. We were made partakers of that manhood which is sinless,
   immortal; we are incorporated in that new creation, of which the second
   Adam is the head, the source, and the beginning. Therefore the Apostle
   calls the font of baptism "the laver of regeneration." We can be born
   into this fallen world but once; and into the new world, which is the
   Church, but once. As, then, there is no second birth in nature, so no
   second regeneration. There is but "one baptism for the remission of
   sins." And as our birth is an isolated event, shut up within the narrow
   boundaries of the moment in which we enter into this fallen world; and
   therefore our after existence is not still called birth, but life, or
   living;--so is our new birth perfected at the font; and therefore our
   after life of faith is not called regeneration, as if spiritual birth
   were a continuous fact, as if we could be always entering for the first
   time into the new creation of God, but our renewal. We are
   thenceforward under the continual transforming and restoring power of
   Him who in Himself hath made all things new. The work of our renewal,
   indeed, is not perfected in regeneration, but only begun. All our life
   long we must grow into the perfection and ripeness of the new manhood
   we have received from Christ. Our renewal shall never be perfect until
   we shall be made like Him, in that day when "we shall see Him as He
   is."

   We must pass to Him by the gate of death; for the death of the body is
   a witness of God's justice and of our sin. Our body of earth is a
   partaker of the new creation, but its time is not yet. It must die,
   turn into dust, be changed, and raised again. This is a great and
   wonderful mystery of God's love and of our humiliation. But death is no
   longer an enemy; it is a minister of the resurrection. As the mystery
   of the Incarnation was not complete till Christ rose from the grave,
   and the new man, the first-born of the dead, came forth into the world,
   having destroyed death for ever, so neither shall our renewal be
   fulfilled until the morning of the resurrection. Then the mystery of
   baptism shall be completed. What was begun in the soul shall be made
   perfect also in the body. The whole outline of the restoration shadowed
   forth in that holy sacrament shall be fulfilled. The whole family of
   God shall be renewed, every one in the perfect likeness of the Son of
   God; and the Word or Wisdom of the Father shall manifest Himself afresh
   through a new creation. "The Beginning" shall once more reveal Himself
   in the unity and the perfection of a world, not restored only, but
   raised to more than its original perfection: to sin and die no more,
   but blissful and eternal in Him who is the "Alpha and Omega, the
   beginning and the end." [72]

   If this divine title of our Lord had been more patiently and devoutly
   considered, many of the deepest and sorest wounds suffered by His body
   on earth, and at the hands of His own professed servants, would have
   been turned aside.

   1. We have here seen two great spiritual facts: the first, that the
   Word, who is by eternal generation of one substance with the Father, by
   the mystery of the Incarnation became of one substance with us. Unity
   of substance does not mean unity of persons, as the Socinians blindly
   say. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, are in
   substance one, but in person distinct. Their personal distinctions are
   incommunicable; so that the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the
   Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost is neither the Father nor the Son. The word
   substance' expresses their common nature, excluding all personal
   proprieties, as paternity, filiation, and procession, by which each
   Person is distinct. And the word consubstantial' guards the
   distinctness of personality, while it affirms the unity of Godhead. So,
   to pass from the infinite to the finite, Christ took of the substance
   of the blessed Virgin. He thereby united Himself to the line of which
   Adam is the first father. The very substance originally created of the
   dust, multiplied throughout mankind, and descending in the generations
   of four thousand years, was taken by the Son of God in the womb of His
   Blessed Mother. His union with us is a consubstantial union. His
   substance as Man, and our substance, are one and the same. Yet His
   Person is not our person: unity of substance does not in the finite,
   any more than in the infinite, carry with it unity of person. Our
   personal distinction and entity is incommunicable. Every living man is
   as personally distinct as every star of light. The unity of brightness
   does not confound the distinctness of their several existence. So far
   we may use this parallel, but no farther; for with us personality
   involves also distinction of will, power, and the like; but in God all
   these are one. Here, then, we see one great spiritual fact, one great
   law and mystery, that between God and man there is a person who is both
   Man and God; consubstantial with the Creator and the creature, the
   finite and the infinite; that by one consubstantial unity He is God, by
   the other, Man.

   There have been from the beginning teachers and sects who have
   endeavoured to destroy the faith of the Holy Trinity and of the
   Incarnation, as the Gnostics, Docetae, Arians, Nestorians, and, of
   later times, the Socinians. It is never to be forgotten, that all these
   sects have alike adopted one principle in the interpretation of holy
   Scripture. They have treated its language as metaphorical and
   figurative: they have explained it as a symbolical expression of
   relations and affinities. For instance, the unity of the Father and the
   Son is not, according to them, in substance, but in volition and in
   love: the Word and the Spirit were impersonal attributes, personated
   only in figure, and the like. Now, against this the Catholic Church has
   always held one uniform doctrine in one uniform language, namely, that
   all these divine mysteries are real, spiritual, and substantial; and
   that spirit is substance and reality.

   %. The other great fact issuing from the last is, that as by this
   substantial unity and personal distinctness the Son lives by the
   Father; so we, distinct in person, but partaking of His substance, live
   by the Son. He Himself hath said it. "As the Father hath life in
   Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself." [73] And
   again: "As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father; so
   he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me." [74] As the unity of the
   Father and the Son is not a figure or metaphor, an external relation or
   affinity, but a real, spiritual unity of substance; so our union with
   the Word made flesh is not figurative or metaphorical, by affinity and
   relation of will, or love only, but in substance, spirit, and reality.
   As the Son partakes of the Godhead of the Father, so we partake of the
   manhood of the Son: as He lives by the Father, we live by Him. Surely
   this great spiritual fact is doubted by no one who does not also deny
   the truth of the Incarnation, or the mystery of the ever-blessed
   Trinity. How can there be any living union which is not real? or real
   union which is not substantial? "God is a spirit." Branches do not
   derive their life by a figurative engrafting, neither is the union of
   the trunk and the root a metaphor. The Incarnation is a real and
   substantial partaking of our manhood; and our union with Christ is a
   real, substantial partaking of His. He partook of ours by the operation
   of the Holy Ghost, and we of His by the power of the same Spirit. The
   miraculous Agent in the Incarnation and in the holy Sacraments is the
   same third Person of the ever-blessed Three, uniting first the divine
   nature to ours in the person of the Son, and now our fallen nature to
   Him as "the beginning of the" new "creation of God."

   If this had been ever borne in mind, the Church would have been spared
   many a rent, and love and truth many a wound. For how, then, could true
   believers treat the holy Sacraments as metaphors and figures? How could
   any confound the nature of substance with the dimensions of a person;
   or misconceive the blessed truth of the real presence of Christ, as God
   and Man, in the holy Sacrament of His Body and Blood? How could notions
   of quantity, locality, circumscription, division, and the like, find a
   place in the contemplations, or even in the controversies, of
   Christians? Alas, we have but ill learned the mystery of the
   Incarnation, so to wander from the mysteries of the Spirit. We are
   united, indeed, to Him as to a Person, but our union with Him is by
   participation of His substance. "As I live by the Father, so he that
   eateth Me, even he shall live by Me." Let us, then, with veneration and
   veiled faces adore His presence. Let us believe His very words when He
   says, "I am the Resurrection and the Life." "I am the Bread of life."
   "This is My body." "This is My blood." My flesh is meat indeed, and My
   blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood
   dwelleth in Me and I in him." These are not metaphors nor figures. God
   forbid. Neither are they to be carnally understood. "It is the Spirit
   that quickeneth; the flesh" (that is, apart from the Spirit, not "My
   flesh, which is meat indeed") "profiteth nothing: the words that I
   speak unto you" are substance and reality; "they are spirit, and they
   are life." What is an unsubstantial spirit but no spirit? an
   unsubstantial life but no life at all? or an unsubstantial presence but
   an unreal presence--a very and true absence? What is an unsubstantial
   regeneration but a word, a figure, and an empty sound?--a worthy
   doctrine only for those who believe in an unsubstantial incarnation, a
   figurative resurrection, a metaphorical creation. O the dreaming
   shallowness of the reason of man! O the depth both of the power and of
   the spirit of God! Let us hold fast what we have, that no man take our
   crown. The law had "a shadow of things to come, but the body is of
   Christ." We have entered into the order of the spiritual world, where
   shadows are not; where all things are real and eternal. Let us trust in
   Him who is "the Amen," the very and true Life, the giver of life, the
   multiplier of all creatures, the Maker and the Healer of the substance
   of our manhood, first in Himself, and then in us who by faith are His.

SERMON XI.

  THE BODY OF CHRIST.

    HEB. x. 5.

   "Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not, but a body hast Thou
   prepared Me."

   THE parable of the True Vine sets before us the great spiritual mystery
   of which these words, spoken by the Messiah in prophecy, plant as it
   were the root. In that parable we see the perfect outline of the
   Incarnation, or Christ mystical in all fulness: the root, the stem, the
   branches, the stately perfection and the exuberant fruit of the elect
   vine. It describes by anticipation the life, growth, and fruitage of
   the Church, and reveals also the source and channels through which the
   quickening life passes into all its structure and farthest sprays.

   These words of the Psalmist, quoted by St. Paul, are therefore a
   prophecy of the Incarnation. In the fortieth Psalm, as it stands in the
   Hebrew, the words here quoted by St. Paul run, "But mine ear hast Thou
   opened;" that is, as the ear of a servant was pierced by his master, in
   token of perpetual service. But the Septuagint, which St. Paul here
   follows, reads, "A body hast Thou prepared me," or "fitted to me."
   These two readings are one in substance. The form of a servant which He
   took upon Him was our humanity; and the boring of the ear is a still
   more vivid prophecy of the Incarnation of the Word made flesh, who
   became "obedient unto death."

   This prophecy, then, plainly declares that the everlasting Son, who
   created the world, and ministered in divers appearances to the saints
   of God, would, in fulness of time, of His own free and loving will,
   humble Himself still more deeply, and take upon Him the body of our
   flesh. God had prepared for Him in His foreknowledge, in love and
   wisdom, by His election of grace, a body of the substance of a virgin,
   chosen to bear the Son of God; and this predestination has in it a
   wonderful depth of mystery, an abundant and eternal fruitfulness. May
   He who foretold His own humiliation for us, lead us by His Spirit, so
   far as is for our good, into the knowledge of this stupendous work of
   love and power. Let us, then, see what is this "body" which was
   prepared for Him of God.

   1. First, it plainly means the natural body, which He took of the
   substance of the Blessed Virgin His mother. This was a very and true
   body of flesh, even as our own. And here let us observe, that as, in
   speaking of men, the word of God uses to speak of our noblest part, and
   puts the soul for our whole nature; so in speaking of the humiliation
   of God, as if more openly to express His abasement, it describes His
   whole manhood by its lowest part: "A body hast Thou prepared Me." We
   must not, however, fall into the Apollinarian or Eutychian errors, and
   imagine that the Word took only a body of flesh and blood, as if the
   divine nature were the quickening mind and soul; or that the spiritual
   nature of man was absorbed in the divine. In the mystery of the divine
   Incarnation two whole and perfect natures were united in one person;
   the Godhead, with all attributes and perfections, infinite and
   eternal,--the manhood, with all its properties and powers of body,
   soul, and spirit. "As the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God
   and man is one Christ." All that makes up the natural perfection of man
   as a moral and reasonable intelligence, together with a passible and
   mortal body, He assumed into the unity of His person. It is only by
   bearing the whole truth in mind that holy Scripture can be rightly
   understood. This being the mystery of the Incarnation, we should be
   prepared to find two distinct currents of language, one relating to the
   divine and infinite, the other to the human and finite nature. And
   these, so far from being contradictions to be explained away, are
   confirmations of the mystery, which rigidly demands a twofold language.
   We read, for instance, of the Son, "All things were made by Him;" [75]
   and again, "He was crucified through weakness." [76] How can these be
   understood of the same person? How could the Creator be crucified, or
   one that was crucified create all things? At one time we read that He
   is in heaven, [77] one with the Father; [78] in the Father, and the
   Father in Him; [79] at another, that He increased in wisdom and
   stature, [80] was subject to His parents, [81] was weary, [82] and was
   less than the Father. [83] These things, which seem to cross each
   other, do indeed attest the union of two natures in one person. If we
   did not read them, heresy would have somewhat to say; because we do
   read them, it has only somewhat to pervert. But neither do the divine
   attributes absorb the human infirmities, nor do the human properties
   lessen the divine; forasmuch as both so unite in Him, that neither are
   the proper natures of God and man confounded, nor the unity of the
   person destroyed. [84] This, then, is the meaning of the prophecy:
   "Thou hast ordained for Me the perfect nature of manhood, in which to
   sanctify humanity, to fulfil Thy will, O God, and to die for the sin of
   the world: a body hast Thou prepared Me.'" In this nature He conversed
   for three and thirty years among us, eating the fruits of the earth,
   taking rest in sleep, subject to all the laws of our earthly state:
   only thrice in His mortal life, so far as we read, the properties of
   our nature were for a while suspended; once when He fasted forty days,
   again when He walked upon the water, and a third time when He was
   transfigured in the mountain. But His very and true natural body was,
   like ours, subject to all infirmities, visible, circumscribed, and
   local; and of this the unbelief of the people of Capernaum is witness.
   "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" [85] They saw with their
   eyes a body like their own, subject to all the same conditions; and,
   according to those conditions, visible and natural, they misunderstood
   His divine and supernatural promise. Wherefore He said, "What and if ye
   shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?" [86] As if He
   had said, "Can flesh and blood, then, ascend up into heaven? If ye see
   this, will ye believe that My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is
   drink indeed?' that there are with God powers and virtues, gifts and
   mysteries, of which ye know not? It is the Spirit that quickeneth.' The
   Spirit is not come, as yet: the flesh,' mortal, visible, and local, as
   ye see it, profiteth nothing.'" [87] And of this it would seem that He
   gave, while yet on earth, a type and shadow. After He had suffered in
   the flesh, and had given His mortal body to be broken upon the cross,
   He rose again from the dead; no more under the conditions of flesh and
   blood, though still flesh and blood. He appeared to them "in another
   form;" [88] He passed the closed doors; He vanished out of their sight,
   and at the last ascended into heaven; where now, in the local presence
   of His natural body, visible to heavenly hosts, He sits exalted at the
   right hand of God.

   2. There is yet another mystery contained by virtue and force in this
   same prophecy. As there was a natural, so there is a supernatural
   presence of the body of our Lord Jesus Christ. He said, "The bread that
   I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
   "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye
   have no life in you; . . . . for My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood
   is drink indeed. He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood,
   dwelleth in Me, and I in him." We have already seen how, when the
   people of Capernaum understood these words in a gross and fleshly
   sense, as if, in St. Augustine's words, "our Lord was about to divide
   and give to them a portion of His body" [89] as then visible before
   them, He, still affirming the reality of the mystery, raised their
   thoughts to a supernatural manner of fulfilment. And when at the last
   supper He gave this great Sacrament to His Apostles, He said openly,
   "This is My Body," "This is My Blood." [90] Upon these words of power
   St. Paul speaks with the plainness of our Lord Himself: "The cup of
   blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of
   Christ"? The bread which we break, is it not the communion"--that is,
   the partaking--"of the body of Christ?" [91] It is not for us to
   attempt to explain the secrets of this mystery. Who can tell how the
   light was created, or how the earth and the world were made; by what
   change flesh and blood were fashioned of the dust, and woman from the
   side of Adam? Who can expound the productive power of the first created
   root, bearing seed in itself; or trace the lineal descent of substance
   in the corn and the olive, or in the family of man? Who can reveal the
   manner of the resurrection of the body, or the mystery of the
   Incarnation? Then here let us stay our thoughts. In the sphere of sense
   all is unchanged, and sense is absolute; in the sphere of faith all
   objects are divine, and His word is sure. What He has said, that He
   will give, in spirit, substance, and reality. Only let us keep aloof
   from vain questions of false science and sensual logic. The mystery of
   the Real Presence is not within the order of nature, nor to be either
   explained or limited by natural conditions. Nature is fallen and dead.
   It fell and died in Adam, but is quickened from above in Christ. What
   place have the laws of nature in mysteries which issue from the
   miraculous conception of a virgin, from an Incarnation of God? Oh,
   foolish and faithless that we are! foolish in philosophy, and faithless
   as members of a divine Head. In our baptism we received "that which by
   nature we could not have;" we were taken up out of the conditions of
   nature into a supernatural order: and yet when, in full Christian
   maturity, we are admitted to the altar, we would fain fall back again
   into "the beggarly elements" of this sensual world. Is it not enough
   for us to know that He who took our manhood, and, in the personal
   attributes of our nature, is at the right hand of God, is present in
   the Sacrament of His Body and Blood? It is enough for us to know, that
   as truly as the life and substance of the first creation are sustained
   and perpetuated until now, so in the second, which is the mystical
   Vine, He is root and trunk, branch and fruit; wholly in us, and we in
   Him. [92] The mysteries of the faith are believed unto salvation, but
   are analysed with neither blessing nor reward.

   3. There is, moreover, yet another and a wider mystery springing up out
   of the last. The natural body of our Lord Jesus Christ is, as it were,
   the root out of which, by the power of the Holy Ghost, His mystical
   body is produced. And therefore He seems to take this title, "I am the
   root and the offspring of David;" [93] the offspring according to the
   descent of the first creation, the root as the beginning of the new.

   This great work of the regeneration He began to fulfil when, at His
   descent into hell, He gathered to Himself the saints who of old were
   sanctified through the hope of His coming. In what way His saints from
   the beginning were made partakers of the Divine nature, which to us is
   given through the Incarnation of His Son, God has not as yet revealed.
   In what way the power of a holy resurrection wrought in their mortal
   bodies unknown even to themselves, we know as little as they. But we
   know that they of old could say, "In my flesh I shall see God;" [94]
   and "my flesh also shall rest in hope." [95] In their souls they were
   made members of the mystical body by "the spirit of Christ which was in
   them." [96] At His descent into the grave they at last beheld their
   glorious Head revealed, and were united to Him by the presence of the
   Incarnation. They were engrafted into the stock of the Word made flesh.
   And though "they without us" could not, when on earth, "be made
   perfect," yet at His descent unto them, they "came behind in no gift,"
   but were made equal to the saints of the kingdom. Then began the growth
   and expansion of the mystical vine. Upon this unity of patriarchs,
   prophets, and saints of old, were engrafted apostles and evangelists,
   and all the family of the regeneration.

   When the natural body of our Lord had been veiled from the eyes of
   flesh, a new object arose before the sight of men. Then was manifested
   upon earth His mystical body, which is the Church. St. Paul writes to
   the Church in Corinth, "Ye are the body of Christ, and members in
   particular." "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all
   the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is
   Christ." He here even calls the whole mystical body by the personal
   name of its Head: He calls it "Christ." "For by one Spirit are we all
   baptised into one body." [97] God "gave Him to be the head over all
   things to the Church, which is His body, the fulness of Him that
   filleth all in all." [98] "From whom the whole body fitly joined
   together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according
   to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase
   of the body unto the edifying of itself in love." [99] Again, He is
   "the head, from which all the body by joints and bands having
   nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase
   of God." [100] The Church, then, is called His body, because He partook
   of our flesh and blood, and became Head of the Church; and the Church
   again, by the Holy Spirit through faith, is made partaker of Him.
   Therefore St. Paul says, we are "of His flesh and of His bones." [101]
   In one sense the Church is called the body of Christ, by metaphor and
   analogy to the members and unity of a natural body: in another sense
   mystically, because of its true and vital union with Him.

   The mystical body of Christ, then, is the whole fellowship of all who
   are united to Him by the Spirit, whether they be at rest in the world
   unseen, or here in warfare still on earth; differing only in this, that
   all His members who have been gathered out of this world are secure for
   ever; but in this world, they who are still in trial may yet be "taken
   away," and, as the fruitless and withered branch, "cast forth" [102]
   for the burning. It is remarkable how this figure, which expresses the
   intense inwardness and spirituality of the body of Christ, expresses
   equally its visible unity and organisation. It is as visible, sensible,
   and local as was the natural body of Christ Himself. In all the world
   it is visibly manifest as the presence of its unseen Head. It speaks,
   witnesses, acts, binds and looses in His name, and as Himself. And so
   in all lands, and through all ages, since He went up into heaven, His
   mystical body, inspired and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, has filled
   His place on earth. The mustard seed has become a great tree, the stone
   a great mountain; the vine has "sent out her boughs unto the sea, and
   her branches unto the river." [103] The Body which, in its natural and
   local condition, was enclosed in an upper chamber, or wound in
   grave-clothes, has multiplied its life and substance as the first Adam
   in the family of mankind, and spread itself throughout the generations
   of God's elect.

   Such is the mystical body of Christ.

   Are there, then, three bodies of Christ? God forbid: but one only; one
   in nature, truth, and glory. But there are three manners, three
   miracles of divine omnipotence, by which that one body has been and is
   present; the first, as mortal and natural; the second, supernatural,
   real, and substantial; the third, mystical by our incorporation. The
   presence is one, the manner threefold; the substance one in all three:
   all three one in Him; whether He be in the holy Sacrament of His Body
   and Blood, or in His mystical members, which together make His Church,
   it is He who, of the substance of the Blessed Virgin, took our nature,
   was born and crucified, rose and ascended into heaven. Other body than
   this was not prepared of His Father, and other than this we know of
   none.

   Surely these great realities ought to teach us many high and practical
   truths.

   1. As, for instance, with how much of loving reverence we ought to
   regard every baptised person. He is "a member of Christ;" what more can
   be spoken or conceived? He is united by the Spirit of Christ to the
   mystical body, of which the Word made flesh is the supernatural Head.
   He has in him a life and an element which is above this world; even
   "the powers of the world to come." [104] St. Peter, by the inspiration
   of God, declares that we are made "partakers of the divine nature."
   [105] What does this mean? It does not mean that we are made partakers
   of the incommunicable Godhead, but that we are made partakers of the
   manhood of the incarnate Word. It is our nature made divine. We partake
   of Him: of His very flesh, of His mind, of His will, and of His spirit.
   He dwells in us according as the capacity of man can receive the
   indwelling of the incarnate God. [106] This is salvation and the
   holiness of saints; the mind of Christ infused and reigning, kindling
   the will with all its affections, quickening the whole spiritual life
   with the fire of divine love, with the power of obedience and patience,
   of sanctity and the cross. In every regenerate soul this exists in germ
   and virtue. When it is unfolded, we see the imitation, the mystical
   presence of Christ. Who can describe the communion of saints, or even
   the mind of one saint? None but saints alone. It is a wonderful and
   incomprehensible depth of love and power. We can but humble ourselves
   in our own dust, and be silent.

   This is the divine reality which has restored to the world two great
   laws of love, the unity and the equality of man. All the members of
   Christ are one in Him, and equal because He is in all. The highest and
   most endowed is but as the poorest and the lowest. Christ's kingdom is
   full of heavenly paradoxes. All are rich, and all are poor: all are
   equal, and all are "subject one to another:" [107] the wise are
   foolish, and fools are wise; the rich are least, and the poor greatest;
   the last first, and the first last. What a mystery of peace and bliss!
   How does this harmonise all sharp worldly contrasts, all abrupt and
   unequal lots, with the soft light of a divine unity. Even the poor
   working man, with his hard palms, sits at the marriage-supper with "the
   king and princes;" it may be sits higher than his earthly lord. With
   what gentleness, reverence, humble and loving distance ought we to
   converse together. How sinful it is to scorn, or to ridicule, a member
   of Christ's body! In the least we despise the Word made flesh. How
   would this habitual memory refine, purify, and elevate all our
   intercourse, and shed a grace upon the humblest and homeliest life.
   There is a courtesy and a mutual observance which is the peculiar
   dignity and sweetness of a Christian; and the source of it is, that he
   sees the presence of his Lord in others, and reveres Him in himself.
   Only the true Christian can have real self-respect. From this springs
   purity of manners, language, conversation, and amusements in private
   and social life. How awfully St. Paul uses this great spiritual fact of
   our incorporation with Christ to enforce the sanctification of the
   body.

   Hence, also, arises the great law of charity and alms: our blessed Lord
   has founded it upon His own mystical presence in all His members,
   especially in the poor, the hungry, the sorrowing, the sick, and the
   dying. And what thought is so full of soothing and consolation? The
   union of Christ's members with Him gives us, not only a law of loving
   reverence for the living, but above all for the dead. When the soul has
   departed to a more intimate union with Christ in the unseen rest, the
   body also is still united to Him who is "the Resurrection and the
   Life." Though the soul is parted from the body, both are still one in
   Him; and that union is the pledge that they shall be reunited at His
   coming. It is this faith which has taught Christians a loving care for
   their dead. Though the sleeping body can no longer consciously receive
   the offices of love, yet it does not cease to be worthy of a sacred
   honour: it is a part of the mystical body of the Lord. Before the Word
   was made flesh, a dead body was an unclean thing; to touch it was
   pollution: but since His holy Incarnation, the bodies of the regenerate
   are holy,--honourable in the dishonour of corruption. Therefore we lay
   them out, and deck them with pure and spotless array, dressing them
   with flowers or with costlier beauty, and bear them forth in
   processions with chants of thanksgiving. A Christian burial, from the
   most royal pageant to the lowliest bier, is a work of loving reverence,
   an earthly type of baptism, a confession of the faith, a shadow from
   the altar, where is the true body of Him who died and rose again.

   2. And one more thought we may take from this blessed mystery; I mean,
   with what veneration and devotion we ought to behave ourselves towards
   the Presence of Christ in the Sacrament of His Body and Blood.

   The first truth which must force itself upon every one who has faith in
   this great gift of love is, the duty and blessedness of celebrating it
   with the greatest possible frequency. Nothing surely ought to restrain
   this frequency, except the awfulness of the blessed Sacrament, and the
   danger of unworthiness in the celebrant and the receivers. But this is
   a subject far too wide to enter upon by the way. Frequent communion
   does indeed demand a high tone of habitual devotion and of inward
   recollection in the pastors of the Church. And this is both their
   highest blessing and their strictest law of life. Happy, and full of
   all benediction to ourselves and to our flocks, if we could so live as
   to be always meet to draw near to Him. But it is not more certain that
   frequent communion demands high devotion, than that a belief in the
   Real Presence demands frequent celebration. How can we be said to
   believe what we do not act upon? "Shew me thy faith without thy works,
   and I will shew thee my faith by my works." [108] Surely, if there be
   any thing in which "faith without works is dead," it is in a profession
   of believing Christ's Presence in the holy Sacrament while we rarely
   celebrate it. They who do not believe in this divine gift are
   consistent in approaching it once a year: but should we be consistent,
   if, believing, we celebrate it but three or four times a year? A living
   faith in this spiritual reality would make infrequent communion
   impossible. Where the holy Eucharist is not, the ritual of the Church
   is as a day when the sun goes down at noon. We should feel as if the
   worship of God through Christ had lost its central light. All the whole
   life of the regenerate is related to this great fountain of grace; all
   issues from it, and returns into it again. When the altar stands cold
   and hare, they are bid to go empty away.

   But if this be the effect of such a faith upon the frequency, what must
   it also be upon the manner of celebrating this holy sacrament? What do
   mean and naked altars, often wormed and decaying; worn arid paltry
   furniture, worthless vessels, and, worse than all, rough and reckless
   handling, certainly reveal? Belief of His presence, or assurance of His
   absence? But alas, our own sins are enough--too many and too deep that
   we should look on others. With what a conscious feeling of direct and
   personal service done to our Master should we tend and dress that which
   is a shadow of His cross and of His grave; with what respect should we
   handle and care for even the least and poorest vessel, sacred by
   relation to His presence. Above all, with what a collected sense of His
   nearness ought we to fulfil our function in offering the memorial of
   His one only sacrifice, by taking, blessing, breaking the Bread of life
   to His people! If only we could apprehend by a living faith, and
   realise the very truth of what we do, we should feel that after His
   sacramental Presence, and our standing there to serve before Him,
   nothing remains but the homage of the blessed in the vision of His face
   in heaven.

SERMON XII.

  THE ONLY SACRIFICE.

    HEB. x. 12-14.

   "This Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat
   down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till His
   enemies be made His footstool. For by one offering He hath perfected
   for ever them that are sanctified."

   THERE is, and there can be, only one atonement for the sin of the
   world--the sacrifice of the death of Christ. This alone is in itself
   meritorious, propitiatory, and of infinite price and power.

   And this is, in fact, the whole argument of the Epistle to the Hebrews.
   St. Paul is shewing that the law of Moses was in itself of no power or
   price; that it could make no propitiation, no true atonement in the
   eternal world; that the vileness of the sacrifices was enough to shew
   their impotence: "It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of
   goats should take away sins." If the vileness of the sacrifices
   confessed their impotence, much more did their perpetual repetition:
   "For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the
   worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins."
   This very iteration, like the repeated use of medicines in sickness,
   proved that they were of no avail: for when medicines heal, they are no
   longer needed. Nay, those sacrifices did more, they directly declared
   the sin which they could not take away. "In those sacrifices there is a
   remembrance again made of sins every year." [109] They were a shadow
   and promise of a sacrifice yet to come, which in itself should be full,
   final, and absolute. "Sacrifice and offering and burnt-offerings and
   offering for sin Thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein;
   which are offered by the law; then said he, Lo, I come to do Thy will,
   O God. He taketh away the first, that He may establish the second. By
   the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of
   Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministering
   and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away
   sins: but this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins, for
   ever sat down on the right hand of God." [110] Such is the whole idea
   of this divine argument. These many priests, many sacrifices, daily
   offerings, were shadows of the one only true Priest, the one only and
   continual Sacrifice for sin, which is Jesus Christ.

   In this we see the true and full perfection of the sacrifice of the
   cross; and that perfection may be expressed in two words,--that it is
   one, and that it is continuous. Let us, by His help, dwell a while on
   this blessed mystery.

   1. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ, then, is one. There is no other like
   it, or second after it. It is not the highest of a kind, or the
   perfecting of any order of oblations; but like His person, a mystery
   sole and apart: "for such an high-priest became us, who is holy,
   harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners." And as with the
   priest, so with the sacrifice. In what does this unity consist? In the
   nature, the quality, and the passion of Him who offered up Himself. It
   is one and unapproachable, because He was a Divine Person, both God and
   man. In Him was not only the blood of the animal life, nor the blood of
   man made in the image of God, but the blood of a Man who is God: why
   shall we fear to say with St. Paul, the Blood of God? [111] Never was
   such oblation as this offered up before, since the world was made. Man
   had sinned against God, and God as man offered Himself up for man. The
   guilt was against an infinite love, and infinite was the atonement. The
   broken law was infinite in sanctity, the price which healed the breach
   was infinite in worth. A world's ransom must be divine, and God gave it
   when He gave Himself.

   In like manner the sacrifice is one, and above all, in the quality of
   the person who, as God, was holy, as man, was sinless. It was not the
   obedience only of man for man, but of man without sin; nor only of
   sinless man for sinners, but the obedience of God. The obedience unto
   death was both human and divine. He who was born of the Ever-Virgin
   Mother was God, He who hung upon the tree was God, spotless and holy,
   the fountain of holiness, the sanctifier of the world.

   And further, as the nature and the quality, so the passion of Christ
   gives to His sacrifice an unity of transcendent perfection. Being
   sinless as man, and being also God, He suffered all the sorrows of the
   fall, and died. All that was due to sin, the Sinless bare in Himself;
   all that was due to us, but as far as the breadth of eternal
   righteousness from Him, He willingly endured. Wonderful and stupendous
   mystery. God "made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might
   be made the righteousness of God in Him." [112] "His own self bare our
   sins in His own body on the tree." [113] Christ "hath once suffered for
   sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." [114]
   The very heart, will, soul, and sensitive nature of our manhood, both
   in the flesh and in the spirit, was in Him afflicted and crucified. All
   that sorrow, pain, and death could wreak upon Him He received into His
   open heart for us. Righteous, holy, pure, perfect in love both to God
   and man, He offered up Himself as a sacrifice of atonement between God
   and man. What other sacrifice has even the shadow of this unity of
   perfection? What self-sacrifice of man is sinless? What other sacrifice
   is divine?

   Therefore we adore this one great Oblation as one, alone,
   unapproachable, absolute, and transcending the order of creation: the
   only true "perfect and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction
   for the sins of the whole world." This, then, is its unity.

   2. But further, it is not only one, but continuous. As by its unity it
   abolished the multitude of oblations, so by its continuity it abolished
   the repetition of sacrifices. To add one more would be to deny its
   final atonement. That which is infinite cannot be numbered. It is one,
   not only because it has no second, but because infinity has no number.

   For the same reason, what is infinite must be, in time, continuous; for
   in itself it is eternal. The sacrifice of Christ is as everlasting as
   His person. All the new creation of God is built upon it. The cross is
   the foundation of "eternal redemption." [115] Even in foresight its
   atonement was perfect. The Lamb was "slain from the beginning of the
   world." All the generations of God's elect, from righteous Abel until
   the oblation upon Calvary, were redeemed by the continuous virtue of
   this one great sacrifice offered in the Divine foreknowledge. After He
   had, in time, once offered up Himself for ever, He sat down, the
   everlasting sacrifice, at the right hand of God. From the great day of
   atonement until now, all the elect of God have been made perfect
   through the continuous power of that one oblation, made once for all.
   He is now fulfilling the Priest's office of intercession over the blood
   of atonement "within the veil." [116] His intercession is the perpetual
   presenting of His own sacrifice, that is, of Himself, bearing the
   wounds of His passion. The memorial, the very and true reality of the
   cross, is always in heaven. He was pierced on Calvary, but His passion
   is still before the mercy-seat. He was pierced eighteen hundred years
   ago, but His blood was shed four thousand years before, and His wounds
   are fresh and atoning until now. His sacrifice is eternal. Though every
   light in the firmament of heaven were a world, and every world dead in
   sin; and though time should multiply the generations of sinners for
   ever; yet that one sacrifice for sin would infinitely redeem all
   worlds.

   Now this leads to two high and blessed truths, revealed to us for our
   endless consolation.

   1. The first is, that the holy Eucharist is a real and true sacrifice.
   Can it be necessary to say, that when the Sacrament upon the altar is
   called a sacrifice, it does not mean a sacrifice added to the sacrifice
   of the cross? That would be to contradict alike all revelation and all
   reason; to make not one only sacrifice, but many; to make them either
   nothing or infinite; either to add to what is already infinite, or to
   give an infinite value to a finite oblation; which is, in truth, to
   deny the need and reality of all sacrifices whatsoever. Let such a
   thought, then, be at once and for ever cast aside. Nothing can be added
   to that which is already perfect. Neither, again, is the Eucharist a
   sacrifice separate from the sacrifice of the cross; for what sacrifice
   but that alone can "take away sin?" No acts or offerings of men, any
   more than the blood of bulls and goats, can take away sin. Faith and
   adoration cannot; for they need an atonement to be themselves accepted
   at all. No creature, no universe of creatures, even deathless and
   sinless, could atone for one sin. Therefore, neither as added to, nor
   as separate from, the sacrifice of Christ is the holy Eucharist a
   sacrifice. In what sense, then, is it so called? Let us take the
   analogy and progress of the great evangelical revelation as our guide,
   and we shall be at no loss to understand.

   Before Christ offered up Himself upon the cross, God ordained the
   sacrifices of the Law, as types and shadows of a sacrifice yet to come.
   They were sacraments looking forward to the cross. Since Christ has
   offered His one oblation of Himself, the broken bread and the wine
   poured out upon the altar are memorials of a sacrifice already perfect.
   It is a sacrifice looking backward to the cross.

   Thus far is clear. It is representative and commemorative. The bread
   and the wine represent the mystery of the Incarnation; the breaking of
   the bread, and the pouring forth of the wine, the passion of the
   crucifixion; the offering them upon the altar before God, the mystery
   of His own sacrifice upon the cross. So far the analogy of God's
   earlier revelation gives an exact parallel. But this is not all. It
   also applies the one Sacrifice to us.

   The Law had "a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of
   the things." The Gospel is not the counterpart of the Law, but its
   fulfilment; or rather, it is the greater which contains the less.
   Whatever we find of grace in the Law, we shall find with much more, in
   "measure pressed down and running over," in the Gospel. The Law was a
   shadow, "the body is of Christ:" that is to say, first, the personal
   work and passion of Christ, His incarnation and atonement, all that He
   did and suffered in Himself, summed up in the one sacrifice upon the
   cross; and next--for this is not all--the application of this work,
   that is, of His one all-sufficient sacrifice, to the souls of His
   elect. The Law, then, is fulfilled in the body of Christ, that is, in
   the person of Christ, and in His Church. Shadows, by passing through
   His cross, have become sacraments; what before stood empty is now full
   of grace; symbols are now mysteries; the outward signs have received
   the fellowship of inward grace. They are wedded together, as the Church
   is to Christ, by the Holy Ghost, which, through His incarnation, has
   been shed abroad upon His mystical body. We are now in a dispensation
   of faith, and "faith is the substance of things hoped for." "By one
   oblation He hath perfected," that is, consecrated wholly to God, "for
   ever them that are sanctified." In and for Himself, therefore, in
   virtue, price, and power, He has redeemed all mankind. But for our
   salvation, that one perfect sacrifice must be directly and personally
   applied to every particular soul. The offering of the one sacrifice to
   the Father is the ministry of Christ by Himself; the application of
   that one sacrifice to us is the ministry of Christ by the Spirit.

   There are some, indeed, who say that we apply this sacrifice to
   ourselves--as the Pelagians, and their followers, whether they adopt
   their whole error, or only a part of it. All these agree in thinking
   that we can of our "own natural strength turn to God," "do good works,"
   or, at least, apply God's grace to ourselves. Many other and better
   Christians, who believe the sovereignty of God's grace as a doctrine,
   but are careless either in thought or language, use the same words.
   When their attention is called to such phrases as that "by faith we
   apply the sacrifice of Christ to ourselves," they at once correct
   themselves, and say, that "faith is the gift of God; and that they mean
   no more than that, through the gift of faith, we receive the
   application of the sacrifice of Christ at the hands of God." This is,
   indeed, the pure truth of the Gospel; for it is as much a work of
   Christ to apply His sacrifice to us, as to offer it to His Father. It
   is His sovereign and sacerdotal act as priest and king. By baptism He
   first applies to us the blood of His Passion for the remission of sins;
   through faith and love He continually unites us more and more unto
   Himself; by absolution He applies His atonement to every true penitent;
   by the holy Eucharist He applies His passion to the sanctification of
   all faithful souls. All these are, as it were, fruits of His one
   sacrifice--channels through which the grace of it flows to us, and
   pledges of its application to us, one by one. But it may be asked, Why,
   then, are not all these called sacrifices? In one sense all may be,
   that is, spiritual sacrifices, acts of faith, love, thanksgiving. But
   there is an eminent and peculiar sense in which the holy Eucharist
   bears this title, in which no other sacrament or office of the Church
   partakes.

   For, as we have already said, the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of
   Christ is a visible memorial and representation of His crucifixion and
   oblation. This baptism is not, and no other mystery of the Gospel is
   ordained to be. Our blessed Lord, in the very act of institution, made
   it a representation of the sacrifice of Himself. "With desire I have
   desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. . . . . And He
   took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying,
   This is My body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of Me.
   Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new
   testament in My blood, which is shed for you." [117] In this our
   blessed Lord did truly, in a symbolical act, offer and give Himself to
   die upon the cross. Through all His life no man could lay hands on Him,
   because His "hour was not yet come." But now, knowing that the time was
   come that He should "go unto the Father," and having "power over His
   life," so that no man could take it from Him; having "power to lay it
   down, and power to take it again;" He here, by a solemn act of
   self-oblation, gave Himself, as the true Paschal Lamb, to be offered
   and eaten by us. The act of that hour was related to the oblation upon
   the cross, as its shadow cast on before. He then, in will and purpose,
   offered Himself; and His own body, which He had there consecrated for
   our sakes unto His Father, He afterwards gave in full on Calvary. In
   its first institution, therefore, the Sacrament of His Body and His
   Blood was a true sacrifice of Himself, through the symbols of bread and
   wine.

   And thus, St. Paul expressly declares the tradition of the Church: "I
   have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That
   the Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread:
   and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is
   My body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me. After
   the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying, This
   cup is the new testament in My blood: this do ye," as oft as ye drink
   it, in remembrance of Me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink
   this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till He come." [118] "Ye do
   shew;" that is, shew forth and exhibit, as St. Paul said to the
   Galatians, "before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set
   forth, crucified among you." [119] And not only so; not only before
   men, but before God, exhibited in the sight of heaven. The Sacrament of
   His Body broken and Blood shed is spread forth upon the altar as before
   God, to whom He offered up Himself. All sacrifice, and all memorials of
   sacrifice, terminate in the Divine presence, before the mercy-seat.

   What the sacrifices of the Law then offered in type, we offer in
   fulfilment; what they promised, this applies to us. When our blessed
   Lord took bread, and said, "This is My body," and the cup, saying,
   "This is My blood," He did not speak in metaphor and figure. What He
   spake, they are; what they are, we offer. In that holy Sacrament He is
   really present; and by His real presence it is the one and continual
   offering of Himself.

   2. And this leads us to the other truth of which I spoke; I mean, that
   it is He who truly offers Himself for us perpetually, both in heaven
   and earth, through and with His mystical body, the Church. The Church
   is so united to Him as to be one with Him. It lives and acts in Him
   alone. Every member of it, and every act of it, out of Christ is dead.
   "If a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
   withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
   are burned." [120] This is the first foundation of the Church--its
   perfect unity of life and act with Christ its Head. As there is but one
   sacrifice, so there is but one priesthood. All that the Church offers
   is Christ, and all that the priesthood of the Church does in spirit and
   in truth is done by Christ. They are but His representatives and
   vicars: many, because finite; but all one in Him, their office one, and
   their acts one. He alone is king and priest, and in Him the whole
   Church is a "royal priesthood." [121] He has "made us unto our God
   kings and priests." [122] Every Christian is spiritually a king and a
   priest, because anointed in Christ. The Church has therefore a twofold
   priesthood, internal and external; the internal, which is hidden and
   universal in every member; the external, which is visible and
   particular, delegated to the sacerdotal order by Christ Himself. The
   external priesthood is the expression and embodying of the internal,
   which thereby fulfils its ministry of sacrifice and worship. It is as
   the ministry of the body to the powers and endowments of the soul; as
   speech is to thought, or power to will. But whether internal or
   external, it is all one priesthood still; the priesthood of Christ
   descending from the Head to the body, whereby He offers the body in
   Himself, and the body, in and for itself, offers Him unto the Father.
   [123]

   In this, then, we see what is the Christian sacrifice. It is Christ in
   heaven offering Himself in visible presence; and on earth, by His
   ministering priesthood, offering Himself in the Sacrament of His Body
   and Blood. Though manifold in operation, and various in kinds and
   accidents, it is still all one sacrifice, one priesthood, one
   continuous act of memorial and exhibition to the Father, of union and
   application to the Church. In one word, then, what is it that we offer
   unto God? It is the infinite merits of His Son; the infinite price
   which, by His incarnation and His death, He has paid for our
   redemption. These merits He has given to His Church. They are hers,
   because they are His. Having nothing of her own, no riches, no "upper
   or nether springs," no "raiment of needlework," no "form or
   comeliness," no dowry of her own, He has endowed her with Himself:
   Christ is the dowry of the Church. This is the sole and only foundation
   of our hope. Through Him, and in Him alone, we come unto the Father.
   Every prayer must pass through His merits. Every work of repentance,
   faith, and love, must ascend through His one sacrifice of Himself.
   Blessed poverty, to have nothing, that we may possess Christ! for then
   "all things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's."
   Verily, for our sakes He became poor, that we by His poverty might be
   made infinitely rich. Wonderful mystery of eternal love! As all the
   multitude of stars hide their borrowed light in the brightness of the
   morning sun, and all mountains, lands, and seas are fulfilled with the
   overflow of his one universal splendour; so all shadows and types of
   sacrifice, offered up through the long weary night of expectation,
   vanished before the one great oblation made upon the cross. And now
   from the highest heaven that infinite atonement sheds itself abroad in
   all the earth. Wheresoever there is an altar in the name of Christ,
   there is the memorial of His cross. "The people that walked in darkness
   have seen a great light; they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of
   death, upon them hath the light shined." [124] The sacrifices of one
   nation, impure, and with blood of beasts, have passed away, and the
   words of the prophet are fulfilled: "From the rising of the sun unto
   the going down of the same, My name shall be great among the Gentiles;
   and in every place incense shall be offered unto My name, and a pure
   offering." [125] Even so as Thy prophet hath spoken; in Thy holy Church
   throughout all the world Thy name is glorified; the incense of
   perpetual prayer goes up before Thee, and the pure oblation, the Lamb
   without blemish and without spot, is laid alway upon Thine altar.
   Blessed mystery, too little realised, even by those who trust in it.
   The world cannot receive it, "because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth
   Him." "The Light" even now "shineth in darkness, and the darkness
   comprehendeth it not." [126] Let us strive more clearly to discern this
   great object of faith, Christ evermore offering Himself for us.
   Evermore: not "that He should offer Himself often; for then must He
   often have suffered since the foundation of the world; but now once in
   the end of the world hath He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice
   of Himself;" [127] not often, but evermore: reconciling us continually,
   after all our sins of wilfulness, ignorance, infirmity; making
   steadfast the peace He has wrought between God and us upon the cross.
   Let this thought dwell in us continually, that all our hope may be in
   Him alone. Day by day let us draw near to Him, to wash our soiled robes
   and make them white in the blood of His only sacrifice. In that
   fountain we must wash ourselves, our souls and bodies, our sins and our
   good works, our prayers and our repentance. And when these are washed,
   what can remain unclean? Above all, let us ever adore Him more and more
   in His blessed Presence with us in the sacrament of His love. To that
   let us come as to the foot of His cross, in sorrowing faith and loving
   hope; praying that, as He suffered a poor penitent with unclean lips to
   kiss His feet at supper, and to stand all cleansed beside His cross on
   Calvary, so He may suffer us, all trembling with our conscious guilt,
   to touch Him through the sacrament of His atonement, lest we die. Let
   us come to Him, saying, "If I must die, Lord, rather will I die here at
   Thy feet, than afar off; if haply even the shadow of Thy sacrifice may
   fall upon me, and under it I be found at last, resting in hope at that
   day."

SERMON XIII.

  THE FEAST OF THE OLD CREATION AND THE NEW.

    ZECH. ix. 17.

   "How great is His goodness, [and how great is His beauty! Corn shall
   make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids."

   ZECHARIAH wrote this prophecy when he and his brethren of the captivity
   were in Babylon. All through the earlier part of the book he has been
   foretelling the return of God's people and the rebuilding of Jerusalem.
   This is the literal intention of his words: "Thus saith the Lord; I am
   returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and
   Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the Lord
   of hosts the holy mountain. Thus saith the Lord of hosts; There shall
   yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every
   man with his staff in his hand for very age. And the streets of the
   city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof."
   [128] "The seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and
   the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their
   dew." [129] "Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore
   with lovingkindness have I drawn thee. Again I will build thee, and
   thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned
   with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make
   merry. Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
   planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things." [130] "They
   shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to
   the goodness of the Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for
   the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a
   watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. Then shall
   the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I
   will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them
   rejoice from their sorrow. And I will satiate the soul of the priests
   with fatness, and My people shall be satisfied with My goodness, saith
   the Lord." [131] "Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord
   will do great things. Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the
   pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit,
   the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength. Be glad, then, ye
   children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for He hath given
   you the former rain moderately, and He will cause to come down for you
   the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. And
   the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with
   wine and oil." [132] "Your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and
   the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your
   bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. And I will give peace
   in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid."
   [133] "The ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of
   grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine,
   and all the hills shall melt. And I will bring again the captivity of
   My people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit
   them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they
   shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them." [134] In all these
   prophecies there is a blessed vision of peace--a time of joy after
   sorrow, of freedom after bondage: every man calling his neighbour
   "under the vine and under the fig-tree." [135] And the symbols by which
   the goodness of the Lord is exhibited are corn and wine. "It shall come
   to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the
   heavens, and they shall hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the
   corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel." [136]
   "Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil." [137] "Israel shall
   dwell in safety alone, and the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land
   of corn and wine." [138] "How great is His goodness, and how great is
   His beauty! Corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the
   maids."

   In all these passages there is a voice of joy, a grateful and festal
   gladness: the city "full of boys and girls playing in the streets
   thereof;" the waste cities inhabited; virgins rejoicing in the dance,
   "old men and young together." As corn and wine are chief symbols of the
   Divine goodness, so the feast of harvest is a chief symbol of a divine
   joy. It is spoken of as the special token of gladness; and its taking
   away, as the special token of affliction. "Therefore I will bewail with
   the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my
   tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh; for the shouting for thy summer fruits
   and for thy harvest is fallen. And gladness is taken away, and joy out
   of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing,
   neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine
   in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease." [139]
   And so, when God poured out blessings on His people, the prophet says,
   "They joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest." [140]

   Surely all this is not only history, but prophecy. All these visions of
   earthly blessing have their heavenly substance. They shew us the joy
   and the feast of the old creation; God's people rejoicing under His
   benign Fatherhood, eating the fruits of the earth with a holy gladness.
   But what are all these,--the joy of God's people in Jerusalem, the holy
   mountain, the cities of peace, the fair lands, the fruitful vineyards,
   the corn and the wine, the harvest and the vintage, the shouting and
   the feast of ingathering,--what are they all but one great prophecy, a
   symbol and a sacrament, the old creation in its earthly festival
   witnessing and waiting for the new?

   In this same chapter, the prophet, by one word, lights up the whole
   mystery. "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
   Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: He is just, and having
   salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of
   an ass." [141] This reveals all. It is "the Israel of God," [142] after
   long waiting and affliction, redeemed from death; the whole election,
   both the elder and the later, not of Israel alone, but of all nations,
   gathered into the city of God. "When the eyes of man," that is, of all
   mankind, "as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the Lord;"
   [143] "and all nations shall flow unto" Him. [144] "The Lord their God
   shall save them in that day as the flock of His people: for they shall
   be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon His land;"
   [145] that is, they shall be gathered to the Word made flesh; to the
   cross high and lifted up on Calvary; unto which, by His love and power,
   He draws all hearts. [146] What is this but the rejoicing of His
   mystical body, the Church, in all the world; the song of His saints:
   all kindreds and people coming up out of dark lands and the shadow of
   death, to the light of eternal life, worshipping "the brightness of His
   rising;" lifting up their oblations and their hands, with the voice of
   adoration: "How great is His goodness, and how great is His beauty!"

   It is a luminous prophecy of the Word made flesh, revealed first by
   personal manifestation upon earth, and then by His Spirit through the
   Church. What is this "goodness" and this "beauty," but the perfect
   mystery of His divine manhood? They are not so much two attributes as
   two aspects of His person. Goodness is inward beauty, beauty is outward
   goodness. They are inseparable; and express to us the perfection of Him
   who is God and Man: perfect alike in both; in majesty and meekness, in
   love and in humility, in His passion and in His power.

   And as it is a prophecy of the Incarnation, so it is also of the holy
   Eucharist, the feast of the new creation. For He is this "corn" and
   "wine" of gladness. "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and
   die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
   [147] "The bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth
   life unto the world. Then said they unto Him, Lord, evermore give us
   this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. . . . .
   The bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life
   of the world." [148]

   "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?
   this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of
   his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Wherefore
   art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth
   in the wine-fat? I have trodden the wine-press alone." [149] This is
   the true corn and wine of God's kingdom, the harvest and the vintage of
   the cross. He was bruised by a divine agony in the garden of
   oil-presses: He gave His body to be broken, and His blood to be poured
   out for us. "For this" the true "Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of
   the most high God, . . . King of righteousness, . . . King of peace,"
   [150] "brought forth bread and wine," [151] and "blessed it, and brake
   it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body.
   And He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,
   Drink ye all of it; for this is My blood of the new testament, which is
   shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not
   drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink
   it new with you in My Father's kingdom." [152]

   "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the
   feast." [153] We have the wine of Cana; the bread of the five thousand
   in the wilderness, the feast of joy and love, of goodness and beauty,
   as "the joy of harvest, and singing, when the vintage is done." This is
   the feast of the new creation, which the Church on earth keeps by a
   perpetual celebration, until, when our toil is over, we shall sit down
   with Him at the "marriage supper of the Lamb."

   Let us see now from what deep fountain the joy of this feast overflows.
   There is something sad and repulsive in the tone of command with which
   the blessedness of the holy communion is forced upon sated and
   reluctant minds. If there be a precept in the kingdom of God, this is
   indeed a commandment sanctioned by the most awful realities of love and
   fear. It is our Redeemer who said, "This do in remembrance of Me." It
   is the command He gave in His night of agony, when His "soul was
   sorrowful even unto death." If love and gratitude can awaken obedience,
   who then can disobey? or if gratitude and love cannot obtain it, will
   not even fear prevail? "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and
   drink His blood, ye have no life in you." [154] And yet, after all,
   there is something unloving and cold in alarming and upbraiding those
   that will not come. It may be necessary to alarm cold and unloving
   Christians; but it is a sad necessity, convicting us of being cold and
   loveless. If we see no goodness or beauty in His sacrament of love,
   words of chilling duty will never kindle our hearts, or open our eyes.
   What we lack is love: this would give us the prophet's sight to say, "O
   how great!" But perhaps we believe that we do already honour the holy
   sacrament, duly frequent, and worthily receive it; perhaps at times we
   have a perception of its sweetness, or at least we think so: and yet to
   how many communicants would He say, "Because thou sayest, I am rich,
   and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not
   that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
   I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be
   rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the
   shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with
   eye-salve, that thou mayest see." [155] This is the state of too many.
   They are as men that have no eye for beauty, no ear for harmonies. With
   too many of us "He hath no form nor comeliness," nor any "beauty that
   we should desire Him." [156] And what is this incapacity for the
   blessedness of His presence but the beginning of that state in which
   His face shall be no more seen?

   Let us, then, endeavour, by His help, to meditate, not on the
   worthiness required in us, but on the blessings which the Lord of the
   harvest pours out on those who come to this supper, where He is both
   the Master and the Feast.

   1. The first grace He gives is rest. "Man goeth forth unto his work and
   to his labour until the evening." [157] But the Master stands in the
   midst, ever saying to His servants, "Come unto Me, all ye that travail
   and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." This is the labourer's
   reward when the work is done: at eventide, when the toil is over, and
   the sun is down, when the burden and the heat of the day have been
   endured, then comes rest. But we serve a pitiful Master, and He, in His
   compassion, gives us rest, not only once for all, when this toilsome
   life is over, but oftentimes all through our life; all day long He
   breaks in upon our toil with times of resting. Month by month, week by
   week, day by day, if our hearts were ready and yearned for the food of
   life, He would restore our strength.

   Rest is manifold, and in the holy Sacrament He gives it in its fulness.
   First, He gives rest from the burden of sin, assuring us of
   forgiveness. If we come with true contrition, and with a pure and
   humble confession, He will unbind the burden, and take it from our
   shoulder. He will make us to feel that He is at peace with us; that
   between Him and us there is no veil of fear; that our sins past are put
   away; and that the long chain by which we have dragged a load of many
   iniquities, galling and wearying our soul, is broken asunder. This is
   the rest He gives to contrite hearts. And if we may kneel before Him
   loosed from our sins, what more can we desire? Is not sin the one thing
   that makes life unhappy, and death terrible? Why should we fear to die,
   but because "we are tied and bound with the chain of our sins;" because
   "the remembrance of them is grievous unto us, and the burden of them is
   intolerable?" The sting of guilt and the stain of sin, these are our
   chief unrest. To be free from these would be the beginning of bliss;
   and in the holy Sacrament of His death and passion, if only we would
   believe, He would perfect our absolution. The mortal sins which in
   times past we have committed, having been penitently confessed, He will
   make us to feel that it is in the power of His Church to loose. All
   through life this assurance grows deeper in the devout communicant. The
   past is not forgotten, it does not lose its blackness; nay, it is more
   keenly perceived; it is seen to be even darker than we saw before; and
   yet we seem to pass through the holy communion farther and farther from
   our former selves, into the depth of His presence. The consciousness of
   past guilt remains, but it is suspended in a consciousness of present
   rest. It abides for our humiliation, and as a mark of shame within; but
   it loses its angry and awful countenance. It condemns no more, but is
   itself condemned. We can hate it, and fear nothing; for our Redeemer
   loves us, and in Him we are "clean every whit." In like manner of the
   sins which we commit daily. Happy is the man who passes from one act of
   holy communion to another without laying up a score of sins needing to
   be forgiven. I do not mean deliberate and wilful, though these, alas,
   too often mingle with the throng of lesser offences; but sins of
   weakness or surprise, of strong and sudden temptations. These cleave to
   us; and though no number of them make one deadly sin, yet their effect
   upon the soul is dangerous, preparing it for greater evil. Often
   falling needs often cleansing; and this fountain stands ever open to
   us. Who that knows the world and sin, the tempter and himself, and will
   not rather need a fence, lest he come too easily, than a goad to force
   him to this sacrament of pardon?

   For, again, it is not only in the peace of forgiveness that the holy
   communion gives us rest. It also sets the heart and will free from the
   misery of inward faults. It is a remedy, all-healing, never failing,
   except through our fault, against anger, pride, luxury, sloth, envy,
   and the like. And what but these are our chief tormentors? What holds
   us in bondage but ourselves? We are our own scourges: we carry our
   miseries within. What makes us fretful, sensitive, wincing, sick at
   heart; what, as we say, galls and stings us, but our inward heart sins?
   While these live in us, we can have no rest. Though all the world go
   smooth and fair without, these would make our days bitter and our
   nights sleepless. Now it is from these also that the power of Christ's
   presence sets us free. He plucks up the very roots of this bitterness,
   and quenches the smouldering heats which sear the heart. But none can
   speak of this rest, except he that knows it by experience j and none
   know it but the sincere and watchful. It is a foretaste of that sinless
   calm which remaineth for the people of God.

   2. And when He gives rest, He gives also refreshment. He does not only
   say, "I will give you rest," but in words that mean, "I will refresh
   you," [158] He renews our strength for labours still to come. We are
   not yet at the great Harvest Home. The sun must go down again and again
   upon our reaping field before our work is over. We all know what is the
   exhaustion of bodily strength, the drying up of powers, and almost of
   life, by heavy toil; but how few are conscious of the perpetual decays
   of the spiritual life, that is, of humility, sincerity, patience,
   gentleness, devotion, which come upon us all day long! The soul wastes
   faster than the body. Every night gives back to the body what every day
   takes from it: but with the soul, not so. The pride, sloth, impatience
   of to-day fret and prey upon the grace which is in us, as a blight upon
   the promise of harvest. The spiritual decays of to-day run on into
   to-morrow, and to-morrow begins with an inclination to a lower tone;
   its own temptations swell the evil: one day heaps its sin upon another,
   and our spiritual decline gains in speed as it gains in time. In this
   there is one specially alarming thought. The degrees are so shadowy,
   and the transitions so imperceptible, that it is like a motion too slow
   to be measured by the eye, or so intense as to seem like rest. These
   decays are always advancing in every soul not supported by habitual
   communion with Christ. Even the most devout complain of them, and fear
   them more than others. And this is one cause why frequent communion is
   a special mark of a devout life. Such persons feeling in themselves a
   perpetual inclination to decay, seek in the blessed Sacrament a
   perpetual supply of restoring grace. It is this that keeps them from
   declension. "In the strength of that meat" they toil on "to Horeb, the
   mount of God:" by the sustaining corn and wine of His elect, they "go
   from strength to strength." If any one, then, has some peculiar
   temptation which habitually besets him, and often gains the mastery,
   that is a special reason for frequent communion. Let him not disquiet
   himself by alarms, as by remembering that he has lately fallen, and
   fearing to fall again; if only he be truly sorrowful and ashamed, out
   of a sincere love of Christ, and a sincere hatred of his sin, let him
   by all means return to the blessed Sacrament as a strength and remedy
   against relapse. If he refuse strength, fall he must. If he say, I will
   not come till I have got the upperhand of this temptation, when will he
   come? And how can he get the mastery? Can he overcome without the grace
   of Christ? Can he have it if he turn away from it? Now here is an
   unspeakable consolation for the tempted; for all who feel the lowering
   and blighting effect of the world, of dangerous companions to whom duty
   binds them, of trying positions from which they cannot escape, of fiery
   temptations searching their inmost thoughts. Let them be of good heart.
   Only stand firm against the assaults and crafts of Satan, only divide
   your sins from you by the barrier of fear and hatred, by the opposition
   of your will and prayers; the blessed Sacrament shall then be your
   strength, and the presence of Christ shall restore all your spiritual
   decays. What you have lost shall be made up to you; what you have still
   to encounter you shall be abundantly strengthened to endure. Be your
   path never so rough and sharp, "thy shoes shall be as iron and brass;
   and as thy days, so shall thy strength be." [159] Come and cast
   yourselves upon His full forgiveness for the past, and upon His
   omnipotence for the future. What more can you need? And this not once,
   not twice, nor for a third time only, but always, and for ever;
   continually bringing to Him your sorrows and your complaints: pleading
   against yourselves, then, go forth again refreshed, as if to begin
   anew, and as for the first time, another life of hope.

   3. Lastly, in this great feast of joy He gives us the conscious
   perception of His love. I say the perception, because we already have
   the knowledge, the tokens, and the pledges. He has said, "Greater love
   hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
   [160] We have His word, we have His holy passion, we have the
   benedictions and mercies of our whole life long. Is not this enough?
   Enough on His part, and to spare; but not enough on ours. We know it,
   confess it, believe it; but we do not feel it. Love alone, by its own
   kindred perception, feels love. And this crowning grace the Master
   gives to His servants, at this feast of rest. He "sheds abroad" His
   "love in our hearts by the Holy Ghost." His love falls as a light of
   fire, making hearts that long for Him to burn. Then all is revealed:
   His cross and our sin, His goodness and our evil, His beauty and our
   deformity of soul. Love is the light in which He is seen, and all
   things in His presence. "The love of the Lord passeth all things for
   illumination." [161] If we would see ourselves as we are, we must first
   "see Him as He is." And this gift of light He infuses into the lowliest
   penitent, howsoever slow of intellect, howsoever dull of understanding.
   If the heart be pure or broken, He will pour in oil and wine, His
   spirit and His blood, the gift of light and love. This is the source of
   all devotion. To feel His love shining down upon them draws them in
   love to Him again; binds them in love to all the creatures of His hand,
   to all for whom He died; kindles in them repentance and compunction,
   holy patience and holy obedience; cleanses and consumes away the sins
   of flesh and spirit, and makes their whole life a living sacrifice, in
   likeness of His own. O words easily spoken; too high and excellent for
   such as we; still, spoken they must be. May He not lay them to our
   charge, or judge us by them! Blessed life, to which they who know it
   say nothing of earth may be compared. They have seen His goodness and
   His beauty, His passion and His purity, the "Rose of Sharon and the
   Lily of the valleys;" [162] and the burden of their heart all day long
   is, "O how great!" Nothing in this world allures them, for they have
   seen fairer things than these; nothing dazzles their eyes, for they
   have looked upon a brighter glory; nothing draws them aside, for they
   have tasted of the eternal sweetness. The Beauty, ancient but always
   new, drowns all lights of earth. And not fair and bright things only,
   but crosses and sorrows, rods and afflictions; these have no terrors
   and no sharpness, They can see by whose hand these gifts are stretched
   forth to them, and in each they count the print of the nails, the
   pledges of His love and nearness. They have one great longing, in which
   all other desires are lost; not wealth, honour, power, learning, home,
   or happiness; nothing of time, or in time. Their whole soul is an
   hungered to "eat bread in the kingdom of God;" to drink of the fruit of
   the vine, "new with Him in His Father's kingdom." They are athirst for
   the great Harvest Home, where the feast shall be eternal. When the
   white cloud shall be seen in heaven, and the Son of Man shall sit upon
   it, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle;
   when He that was reaped, bruised, and garnered, and hath given Himself
   to us for our spiritual food in power and mystery, shall reap the
   earth; when the harvest of the elect is stored in heaven, and the
   eternal feast is spread in the new creation of God: O blessed and
   glorious fellowship! O holy feast! O banquet of desire! where care is
   not, nor cloying, but fulness with endless desire; when we shall for
   ever rest, and shall behold how sweet the Lord is, and how great the
   multitude of His sweetness. O blessed vision, to see God in Himself, to
   see Him in us, and ourselves in Him, with blissful joy and joyful
   bliss; to sit at that feast ineffable, "where Thou, with Thy Son, and
   the Holy Ghost, art unto Thy saints true light, perfect fulness,
   everlasting joy, gladness consummate, endless bliss!" "To whom be
   blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and
   power, and might for ever and ever. Amen."

SERMON XIV.

  THE PASSOVER GREATLY DESIRED.

    ST. LUKE xxii. 15.

   "And He said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover
   with you before I suffer."

   THESE words were spoken by our Lord in the night of His betrayal. When
   the hour was come, He sat down to the last supper with His disciples,
   and His "soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death." As they were
   eating, He said: "With desire have I desired to eat this Passover with
   you." It must indeed have been a desire "stronger than death," ardent
   and divine, which could rise above the anguish of such an hour. Sorrow
   and the shadow of death draw men's hearts into themselves, and quench
   the vividness of other thoughts, the desires of other days. But His
   thirst of love nothing could slake. It burned the more as the hour of
   His Passion drew near. We cannot enter into the divine intensity of
   this desire; but it would seem that the longing He had to eat this
   Passover with His disciples before He suffered, arose from the
   consciousness, that in that hour and in that act He would for ever put
   an end to shadows, and bring in the substance of our redemption. Year
   by year, until that night, the lamb of the Passover had prophesied the
   atonement in His blood. The whole Church had yearly celebrated a
   sacrament prefiguring His death; but the shadows were now passed away.
   The true Light was come; the true Lamb, the true Sacrifice, the only
   bloodshedding was at hand."

   And besides this, we may believe that He desired that hour with the
   ardent longing of our human infirmity, because it was the winding up of
   the long years in which He had waited for His bitter passion: "I have a
   baptism to be baptised with, and how am I straitened till it be
   accomplished!" The fear of death is a pure human affection, a natural
   and sinless shrinking from grappling with the powers of sin, and from
   the pangs which we must suffer in the struggle. He too foresaw the
   sharpness of death which He had undertaken to overcome; and this
   foresight "straitened" Him. It was now near to begin, and the end was
   not far off. The sooner begun, the sooner ended. We go forth even with
   impatience to meet sorrows which we cannot turn aside.

   But there was, perhaps, another reason. That last mournful Passover was
   a solace to the Son of man. It was sad, but sweet. It was to be the
   last time that He should so converse with the disciples and friends who
   had long loved and followed Him. We all know what the last day or the
   last night is before some great parting, before some happy time comes
   to an end; before some departure, some change which reaches to the
   foundations of home and heart: the last evening spent in some loved
   haunt, the last meeting with some fond friends, the last time of doing
   some familiar work, the last partaking in some act of common devotion.
   It is soothing, and yet so calm as almost to take away its power to
   soothe. We look on to it, and long for it, though its coming only
   brings the end the sooner. Yet in itself it is so blessed, that we shut
   our eyes, and will not look beyond, leaving the morrow to come, if it
   must. There are two great seasons of perfect sweetness and sadness,
   farewells and death-beds. They are times which draw out all tenderness
   and love: and some such thoughts and feelings were no doubt in the
   heart of our blessed Master when He looked on to this eventide, and
   said, "With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before
   I suffer."

   These thoughts give a peculiar depth, and, if I may so speak, a divine
   pathos to His words. Perhaps we have never heard them without feeling
   their intensity of meaning. How powerful and persuasive is every word
   and act of His in that hour of unutterable tenderness and sorrow. What
   a light it casts upon the blessed Sacrament which He then bequeathed to
   us, and on the law which binds us to it.

   1. For first, this shews us that the holy Sacrament is this last
   Passover continuing still. What was then begun is a perpetual
   celebration. "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, therefore let
   us keep the feast." The whole life of the Church is a paschal festival.
   Every year brings Easter back; but Easter is in every week. It ought to
   be in every day. This is the Passover He so ardently desired; the very
   substance which He then brought in and ordained for ever. When He sat
   with His Apostles, He took bread and wine, and offered up Himself both
   in figure and reality. The sign and the substance were then united in
   one act, and are inseparable. He now, for ever, offers up Himself in
   Heaven; and His Apostles, through their successors, offer up the same
   Passover on earth, and they will offer it alway, even unto the end of
   the world. In heaven and in earth, it is but one act still, one
   priesthood, and one sacrifice. The Church is the upper chamber spread
   abroad; a sphere above this visible world, hanging over all the earth.
   It is in all lands, under all skies, upon the floods and in the
   mountains, in the wilderness and on trackless shores, wherever two or
   three are gathered together, there is the upper chamber, and the
   paschal table, the disciples, and the Lord of the true Passover, the
   Sacrifice and the Priest. At every altar He takes bread and wine,
   blesses, and gives His body and His blood. This whole action and event
   is a continuous and ever-present reality. We do not repeat or imitate,
   but perpetuate and continue the act which He began that last night
   before He suffered. And, by continuing it, we unite ourselves to Him in
   it. We go up into the room furnished and prepared; and are present, not
   more now than then, not more here than there. The kingdom of our Lord
   is in spirit and in truth. Our Sacrament is the true paschal sacrifice,
   indivisible and one.

   2. And this may shew us further, that with desire He desires still to
   eat this sacrament of His love with us. How strangely this inverts our
   common ways of speaking. We look upon the holy communion as a
   commandment to be obeyed, or a blessing to be sought. Perhaps we may
   also regard it on our part as a source of strength and solace; but do
   we realise that it is He who is desiring to eat it with us? that the
   chief desire is on His side; that it is He who invites, calls,
   beseeches us; that He stands at the altar waiting and longing for our
   approach; and all this because of His divine love for sinners, because
   our sanctification is His joy? How full of all wonder is this
   tenderness and patience of love! That He should suffer such as we are
   to draw near; that He should endure to receive sinners, and to eat with
   them; that after our sins, backslidings, betrayals, our wilful
   infirmities and cold, heartless estrangements, He should at all accept
   of our advance, this is miraculous: but that He should desire to be
   touched by the hands of lepers and the lips of the unclean; that He
   should long for us while we stand aloof from Him; that when we draw
   near, His desire should be ardent and ours languid; that the joy and
   solace, if I dare so speak, should be more with Him than with us, and
   that the blessedness of that divine communion should be deeper in His
   heart than in ours,--all this is the mystery of love, the length and
   breadth and depth and height whereof pass all understanding. And yet
   there is somewhat we may comprehend, for His desire is like His love,
   divine. The infinite and unextinguishable love which brought Him from
   His Father's bosom to die upon the cross; the tenderness of the Good
   Shepherd, in whose eyes the lost are precious as His own blood; these
   make Him to yearn over us when our swerving, cold, slothful hearts draw
   near with a scanty and feeble desire. The greater desire is always with
   the more perfect; the greatest is with Him in whom no imperfection can
   be. And what is the source of this divine longing? Why does He desire
   us to eat this Passover with Him? It is because He desires our faith
   and love, our repentance and obedience, our presence at the paschal
   feast in the kingdom of God. His "delights are with the sons of men,"
   therefore He surrounds Himself with His friends, and so fulfils His
   promise: "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
   unto Me." The first moving cause of this divine desire is that He may
   pour forth His blessings of power and grace upon us. The law of the
   Divine love is to overflow upon the creation of God. The eternal
   fountain sheds abroad its fulness on all orders of His works. His love
   is "the first arid the last." It moved Him to create all worlds; to
   redeem us by the gift of Himself; to regenerate us by the inspiration
   of His Holy Spirit. The same love moved the Word to be made flesh, and
   to suffer for our sins. It was the source of this strong desire on His
   night of agony; it is now the spring from which life, healing,
   cleansing, illumination, solace, strength, and bliss flow down upon His
   Church. When we draw near to Him at the altar, He sees our wounds, our
   weakness, our infirmities; He sees our needs, and our strong desires,
   and it is His joy to heal, strengthen, and save.

   Let us now see in particular what are His intentions and acts of grace
   to all His faithful servants in this feast of redemption.

   1. First, He desires to apply to us the benefits of His passion. The
   sacrifice upon the cross, which is of infinite worth to redeem all
   mankind, is made salvation unto each of us, as it is applied to us one
   by one. It is no more in our power to apply it to ourselves than to
   redeem ourselves. The application of the blood of Christ is an act of
   His sovereign grace. It is applied to us first in the laver of baptism;
   but its cleansing needs to be perpetually renewed, that the sins of our
   frail and evil will may be perpetually washed away. We stand before God
   in virtue of that one sacrifice, and by that alone. Therefore in the
   eating of the true Lamb of atonement, our compassionate and loving High
   Priest applies the sacrifice of His death for our perfect pardon. He
   desires to absolve us by the power of His atoning oblation, and to
   present us in Himself without spot unto His Father. No sinner hopes to
   be forgiven so as He thirsts to forgive. To pardon is even more
   blissful than to create. To draw us to the foot of the cross, to
   sprinkle us with His own divine blood, to unite us to His own
   sacrifice, this is His desire. Who, then, when He calls will go away
   unforgiven? who can fear to come?

   2. And again, He desires to give Himself to be our spiritual food. It
   was His delight to give Himself in our stead; to leave His kingdom, His
   glory, His eternal joy, to make Himself poor, outcast, and ashamed. He
   humbled Himself to be a servant, to be made in the likeness of men, to
   obey and to die, and that upon the cross, and all for us. But as if
   this were not enough, He has humbled Himself to be for ever our
   spiritual sustenance; He comes to us, "that we may dwell in Him, and He
   in us." He has "compassion on the multitude," toiling onward to the
   heavenly country, and gives them to eat in the wilderness, lest "they
   faint by the way." It is His delight to work this divine miracle, not
   in the mountain or by the sea alone, but in all the world, and in all
   ages, upon every altar feeding every hungry soul with Himself. With
   desire He desires to see the thousands that follow throng about Him for
   the bread of life, and to satisfy them.

   3. And lastly, He desires to make us, even now in this life, behold His
   love. Love pent up withers away; but Divine love cannot be straitened:
   it is like the light of heaven, which pours down in floods upon the
   earth. He is God, and God is love; and the bliss of God is to shew His
   love to all His works. As He gathered round Him the twelve and the more
   favoured three; as He cherished the disciple beloved above all; as He
   delighted to shew His love to "Martha and her sister and Lazarus;" as
   the trembling, the brokenhearted, and the penitent, came to Him upon
   earth, and He made them conscious of His compassion; so He desires us
   to approach Him now in the Sacrament of His death, that He may give us
   the inward pledges and perceptions of His love. We know how among
   friends the interchange of mutual love is sweet, and how they who love
   most have most joy in making their love felt. What we call tenderness
   is the desire love has to cherish its object with endearment. Dare we
   ascend from things of earth to things of heaven? Was it not for this
   that the Son of God, who was in heaven, came down to earth? What is the
   mystery of the Incarnation, but God loving and cherishing man with a
   love not alone divine, but also human? Our Redeemer is not only very
   God, but very man in all the truth of our humanity. And His human
   affections follow the laws of our perfect manhood. With desire He
   invites us to Himself, that He may shew to our intimate consciousness
   the personal love which moved Him to give Himself, with full intention,
   for each several soul.

   And now, from all that has been said, let us learn one great and
   searching truth.

   Above all other motives for drawing near to the holy Sacrament of His
   body and blood, this is the first and chiefest: because He desires to
   eat this feast of love with us.

   O cold and constrained hearts, who draw near only because He has
   commanded. O close and calculating souls, who come because it is for
   their advantage. Hard and perishing are they who have cause to be
   afraid to come; unbelieving and ungrateful, who, without cause, turn
   their backs upon His desire. On earth, "He was despised and rejected of
   men." So is He now. "And we hide, as it were, our faces from Him." He
   stands upbraiding with tones of love: "O My people, what have I done
   unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against Me:" "All
   the day long have I stretched out My hands:" "How often would I . . . .
   but ye would not:" "Ye will not come to Me, that ye might have life."
   [163] If any dying friend, in the night of his last agony, should say,
   "Day by day kneel down at noon and remember me," love would constrain
   us to fulfil it. The known desire of one loved and departed is among
   the most powerful and persuasive motives. If we should forget it for a
   day, we should be cut to the heart; we should reproach our unstable
   affections. "Out of sight, out of mind," is the world's reproof to
   heartless friends. How, then, shall we escape rebuke, if we neglect so
   fervent a desire? Blessed thought, that He is drawing us to Himself;
   that all His will is towards us, and all His heart set upon us, even in
   the midst of our faults, follies, weakness, inconstancy, and sins. What
   we are He knows, and yet, such as we are, He desires our fellowship,
   that, by communion with Him, we may be cleansed and changed; that the
   altar here may be a preparation and a foretaste of the marriage-supper
   in heaven, where, with face unveiled, He will sit down, and all His
   saints and all His beloved ones with Him, at the eternal Feast which
   shall be eaten ever new in the kingdom of God.

SERMON XV.

  WORTHY COMMUNION.

  ST. MATT. ix. 21.

   "If I may but touch His garment, I shall be whole."

   THIS miracle sets before us many of the deepest realities of the life
   of faith. It shews us, as in a parable, the source and the manner of
   our spiritual healing.

   This poor woman had been afflicted with a long infirmity. For twelve
   years she had tried all human skill; she "had spent," St. Luke says,
   "all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any." [164]
   Or, as St. Mark says, she "had suffered many things of many physicians,
   and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather
   grew worse." [165] When she heard of Jesus, she thought that He had
   power to heal; that even "His garment," "the border of His garment," if
   she could but touch it, would make her whole. She came "in the press,"
   as if fearing her own unworthiness, and touched Him, "and was healed of
   that plague." And when Jesus knew that virtue had gone out of Him, she,
   finding that she could not be hid, came, "fearing and trembling,"
   falling down at His feet, and "told Him all the truth."

   Now we have here a remarkable example of faith bringing conscious
   unworthiness into the presence of our Lord. Even after she was healed,
   she was full of trembling fear. Before, she dared not to meet His eye,
   or to ask His pity; she ventured only to come "in the press behind,"
   and to touch "the border of His garment." We may see in this a temper
   not uncommon among devout and lowly minds, a mixture of longing and
   shrinking, of desire and fear. They dare not think that they may meet
   the presence of our Lord, and yet they fully believe that He alone can
   heal them. This applies to every act of faith and devotion; but, above
   all, to the Sacrament of His body and blood. What is more common than
   the desire to communicate, mixed with the fear of communicating
   unworthily? How many would fain come "in the press," and yet tremble
   and fear. How often do such Christians ask, with anxious hearts, What
   is the fitness required for the holy Sacrament? and how do I know that
   I am not coming unworthily? By what tests can I try and judge myself,
   that I be not "judged of the Lord" at that day? Let us see, then, what
   this miracle will teach us.

   We have here, as in a parable, this whole spiritual mystery, and the
   dispositions necessary to worthy communion.

   1. For in the holy Sacrament our blessed Lord is as truly and
   personally present as He was in the midst of that great throng. As God
   He is present always; therefore as man He can be never absent: for in
   His divine person the Godhead and manhood are so united as never more
   to be divided. The Eternal Word is with us in the person of Jesus
   Christ. It is not a partial and divided, but a whole and undivided
   presence. The manner and the manifestation is no longer visible and
   local, but invisible and transcendent. As in a place, and in the proper
   dimensions of His personal form, He is visibly manifest in heaven; but
   after a divine and invisible manner the Incarnate Word is present in
   the new creation of God. This is true of the whole Church; but it is
   true, in a way peculiar to itself, of the holy Sacrament. We are too
   apt to conceive low and earthly notions of this divine mystery, and to
   suppose the presence of His body and blood to be something partial and
   apart from the fulness of His perfect and living presence. His body and
   blood can no more be separated from His presence than His Godhead from
   His manhood. But in that holy Sacrament the object of our faith is the
   presence of Christ, God and man, in all the reality and substance of
   His Godhead and His manhood. He is personally with us, under the veils
   of the consecrated elements, as truly, though in another manner, as He
   was present in the garment, the hem of which wrought miracles of
   healing. The holy Sacrament is not the sign of an absent person, nor a
   mere figure or symbol, suggesting, picturing, commemorating. In the
   order of nature it is sign and shadow; but in the order of grace, which
   is supernatural, it is substance and life.

   2. And this shews us further, that when we come to the holy Sacrament,
   we verily and indeed touch Him. It is the form in which He offers
   Himself to us, thereby prolonging His presence and healing on earth.
   The mystery of His sacramental presence is the time appointed by
   Himself for our approach: it is the occasion when He suffers us to draw
   near, as He invited Thomas: "Reach hither thy finger." And let us not
   think that, for our salvation, there is any real difference whether we
   touch Him by the sensible touch of the hand or not. It was not the hand
   which drew forth the healing virtue that went out of Him, but faith, of
   which the hand was but the instrument. And we touch still by faith.
   Neither was it the garment which had power to work miracles, but He who
   bare it. Faith touched Him by the hand through the hem of His garment,
   as now faith touches Him under the veils of the holy Sacrament.

   Let us realise this great gift of Christ, by divine faith in the order
   of grace; let us truly conceive the dignity of this holy mystery, its
   heavenly truth and power.

   Is it not because we do not believe this divine work that we come so
   languidly and coldly to the holy Sacrament? I am not now speaking of
   those who come sinfully and in sacrilege; nor of those who are indeed
   unworthy to come; but of those who, though fearing, are yet worthy
   according to the measures of our sinful hearts. It may be said that
   they are least worthy to come who think themselves the most so; and
   that they are most unworthy who least feel their own unworthiness:
   such, for instance, as come not "in the press" and with fear, but with
   boldness and a confident approach, never doubting their own fitness: or
   such, again, as are high-minded, self-esteeming, fearless, slothful,
   easy, shallow, undisturbed in their self-persuading assurance. These
   communicants come to the altar with little or no perception of the
   divine reality they are approaching; their lives are lives of sense,
   and they judge of the holy Sacrament by sense and in the order of
   sense. They, indeed, ask no questions, having no fears; but awakened
   and humble hearts mistrust their own fitness, and desire some rule by
   which to judge themselves. If, then, to approach His sacramental
   presence now is all one with approaching His visible presence then; if
   to touch the hem of His garment was a prophetic type of the touch
   whereby we receive the virtue which goes out from Him in the mystery of
   holy communion; must we not believe that the dispositions of heart with
   which we should have ventured to approach Him then, are the same as
   those with which we should approach Him now?

   Let us therefore see what they are.

   1. The first disposition is a sense of our own infirmities. As a weary
   and lingering sickness drew this poor woman to Him on earth, so a sense
   of our life-long sinfulness draws us to Him now that He is in His
   heavenly kingdom. The first reason, therefore, why we must needs come
   is the reason some plead for staying away. They ask, How can I dare to
   come, who am so sinful? Ought they not rather to ask, How dare I, who
   am so sinful, stay away? what hope for me but in coming? When I say, a
   sense of sinfulness, I mean, not a consciousness of indulged or
   unrepented sins, but a consciousness of sins for which we continually
   sorrow. Be they what they may, heavy and numberless: though it be an
   indwelling sinfulness, which spreads through the whole spiritual life,
   in thoughts, tempers, imaginations; making us prone to fall, and weak
   to arise again; though at times we seem darkened, harassed, swayed, and
   almost turned aside from God; yet if we be truly grieved and humbled,
   even these are no bar to worthy communion. Nay, a fear and a danger of
   falling even into mortal sin, a sense of the strength of temptation,
   the treachery of our own hearts, the weakness of our will, need not
   keep us away. The consciousness of shallow repentance, imperfect
   sorrow, want of love, languid affections, cold devotion, wandering
   prayers, sluggishness in the spiritual life, restless activity of the
   animal and worldly nature,--all this burden of conscious un worthiness
   might well make us shrink from Him, if it were not the very reason why
   we must needs draw near. It is but a little trial of faith to believe
   that Christ loves us, until we have come truly to know our own
   sinfulness. So long as we do not feel this inward burden, it costs
   little to say we believe His love. We may believe it as an intellectual
   truth; but we do not trust in it by the faith of the heart. When a
   conscious unworthiness of being loved rises up and condemns us, when
   our inward soul seems to contradict the possibility of His love to us,
   then to believe that He loves us still is faith. And we often find that
   people who have been in the habit of coming without fear to the altar
   while their inward convictions of sin were slight and shallow, as soon
   as deeper thoughts begin to stir within them, and sharper convictions
   to pierce their conscience--that is, when indeed they are becoming more
   fit to communicate than before--begin from that very time to fear and
   to shrink back from the holy Sacrament. Now it is just at this very
   point that their faith is put on trial. The grace of the holy Sacrament
   and the nearness of the presence of Christ has revealed to them a
   fuller knowledge of themselves. If His light were not in them, they
   would not see themselves; they would be unconscious as before. It is by
   shewing them what they are, that He tries their trust in His love. The
   more they feel their lost and sinful state, the more they need to hold
   fast by Him; and He reveals it for this purpose, that they may draw
   closer and closer to His presence. Therefore, the first condition to
   worthy communion is a sense of un worthiness--a trembling,
   self-accusing consciousness of sin, which, while it makes us fear to
   draw near, makes us still more afraid to stay away. It is our sin which
   makes us unworthy, and yet our sin is the necessity which forces us to
   His feet.

   2. Another disposition is a conscience clear from sin. When I say, that
   our sinfulness ought to bring us to the altar, I do not mean wilful
   sin, even of the lightest kind. Indulged or unrepented sin, howsoever
   small, is a direct contradiction to the spirit of our Lord. We have
   been speaking of the indwelling sinfulness which was in our nature at
   the time when He first took us, by baptism, into His mystical body. He
   opened between Himself and us a living relation, a channel through
   which His sinlessness might sanctify our sinful hearts; arid, such as
   we are, He still holds us fast, maintaining, on His part, that relation
   of love unbroken. We know that as sinners we were all separated from
   God, and yet that by grace we have been united to Him again. We know
   also that some Christians by their sins separate themselves again from
   Him, for all sins tend to separation. "There is no man that liveth and
   sinneth not;" nevertheless there are some who still abide in union with
   God. Yet they too sin, but their sins do not separate them from Him;
   they are not free from sin, but their fellowship with Him still
   endures. And how is this to be understood? "All unrighteousness is
   sin," but "there is a sin not unto death." Some sins do, and some sins
   do not, separate the soul from God. All have the sinfulness of sin, but
   all are not alike. There was sin in Judas: St. James and St. John were
   not sinless; yet these were in perpetual communion with their Lord;
   while the traitor, even at the last supper, was already cut off from
   His fellowship. This shews us the distinction between venial and mortal
   sins; that is, between those sins which do, and those which do not,
   separate the soul from God. Such sins need deep repentance, yet they do
   not separate true but failing hearts from their Redeemer's grace and
   love.

   When I say, then, a conscience clear from sin, I mean, clear from the
   memory of sins unrepented, and from the presence of sins still
   indulged. An example, perhaps, may make this plainer. Suppose two
   friends, one gentle and forgiving, the other smouldering with anger.
   They may live together and converse, they may exchange outward tokens
   of affection, but they have no communion. There is in the one a spirit
   which suspends all fellowship of soul. Light and darkness, harmonies
   and discords, can as little blend as their sympathies and tempers. Or,
   to take an example in our own minds. We know how any irritation or evil
   thought clouds and casts out all holy love, aspiration, and desire. So
   long as it lasts, it possesses the whole soul, and all higher
   affections are banished. They are mutually destructive: they cannot
   co-exist. We are at variance with ourselves; between our better and our
   worse self there is a direct contradiction. So it is in the communion
   of Christ with us. A mind that is proud, selfish, or angry, directly
   repels the mind of our Lord. Would this trembling woman have dared to
   draw near and touch even the hem of His garment, harbouring in her
   heart a consciousness of wilful sin? Her very faith, which taught her
   that there was in Him a power mighty to heal, would have taught her
   that there was in Him also a power mighty to punish. Her faith was not
   more strong than pure. So when we draw near and touch Him in that holy
   Sacrament, we must take heed that there be not in us any thing at
   variance with His character and spirit; that His love, purity,
   gentleness, humility, truthfulness, may find in us no contradictions,
   no provocations, no antagonists; that is, no wilful cherishing of a
   spirit at variance with His own. There will be, alas, in all of us the
   remainders and the inclinations out of which these provocations spring;
   but if they are not indulged, if they are striven against and lamented,
   they are our sicknesses and our afflictions; our wounds which moved His
   pity to die for us, to unite us to His own life-giving body, and still
   to dwell among us by a perpetual presence, that we may touch Him and be
   healed.

   3, We will take one more disposition of worthy communion, and that is,
   a sincere desire of perpetual union with Him. If we may venture to use
   an earthly example, we may consider how the presence of any wise and
   holy friend subdues the worse and sustains the better part of our
   character. We know how variously we are tempted by various persons: how
   with some we have no restraint, with others we are ever on our guard;
   how some provoke our faults, and others seem to lay a spell upon them;
   their society raises us above ourselves, awakens better desires, higher
   aspirations, worthier motives; their tone of voice, their look, their
   bearing, allure and win us from ourselves. So long as we are with them,
   we seem better men, nearer to God's kingdom, freer from temptation,
   stronger to control ourselves. And this may in some faint way express
   the power of Christ's presence upon our hearts. So long as we hold by
   Him and He by us, our inward sinfulness dies down and disappears.
   Earthly desires, inclinations, and thoughts seem cast out as a
   possession. So long as the eye of our consciousness is fixed upon Him,
   His light pours in upon us. The whole of our mind seems to be cleared
   of every shadow, and to be filled with the brightness of His presence,
   with light, love, and a holy will. We feel that if He were ever with
   us, if we could be ever with Him, ever touching Him, we should draw
   into our souls perpetual virtues of sanctity and strength. It seems to
   us as if we could never sin again, never see sin in any other light
   than the light of His presence, never again care for the world, or
   hanker after life, or faint in loving Him. It seems at the time as if
   we were in very deed "bone of His bone, flesh of His flesh," spirit of
   His spirit, mind of His mind, heart of His heart, will of His will; as
   if He held us in our whole nature to Himself, uniting us to His divine
   person, "that our sinful bodies may be made clean by His body, and our
   souls washed through His most precious blood," that, by an ineffable
   union and intermingling of His very self with ours, "we dwell in Him,
   and He in us."

SERMON XVI.

  COMMUNION WITH CHRIST.

    ST. JOHN xiii. 23.

   "There was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus
   loved."

   WHAT name is more blessed than this title by which St. John conceals
   himself? Who was ever more favoured than he? It was a sweet memory in
   his old and solitary age, to remember that night of awe, in which he
   lay upon the bosom of his Lord. What was all that he had ever suffered,
   long years of toil and weariness, with contradiction and persecution,
   bondage, and a martyrdom of will, to the consciousness of his Master's
   love? And yet it was doubtless for some deeper reason that the
   evangelist wrote these words. It was not to publish abroad his own
   peculiar favours, nor to prefer himself to others in his Master's
   presence. He had long since unlearned to seek "the right hand" or "the
   left" in His kingdom. It was perhaps to give warrant to the certainty
   of his written testimony; but it was surely to reveal also the deep and
   divine mysteries of love which lie hid in the incarnation of the
   Eternal Word.

   This was indeed a great and wonderful sight. God taking man into His
   bosom--a man leaning upon the bosom of God. As the words of our Lord
   were miracles, and His miracles words of grace, revealing ministries of
   His spiritual power, so we may find in this, as in all His acts, a
   significant and symbolical character. Let us see what may be implied in
   it.

   1. First, we here see, as by a parable, the love of the Son of God in
   the mystery of His own incarnation. He, being God, took our nature upon
   Him; "not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the
   manhood into God." In His person, one and indivisible, the two natures
   are united. Our infirmity leans upon His might, our manhood upon His
   Godhead. In Him it is sinless and divine. And now in the bosom of the
   Father, "above all principalities and powers, and every name that is
   named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come," the
   man Christ Jesus is exalted. There is a man in the bosom of God. Our
   nature is in glory. As we say at the altar, in the end of our Christian
   sacrifice, "For Thou only art holy, Thou only art the Lord, Thou only,
   O Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God the
   Father."

   2. But, again, we may see here His love in the salvation of His elect.
   When He took our manhood into God, it was that He might take us also
   unto Himself. The glorious Body of the Word made flesh is the centre of
   His mystical body, and to it He joins us one by one. We who were by
   nature dead in trespasses and sin, outcasts, and without God in the
   world, He gathers together from all ages and all lands unto Himself.
   The Word made flesh, though in visible presence revealed always in
   heaven alone, is always present upon earth, and He has been
   perpetually, and by manifold ways, gathering His elect into His bosom.
   They who, from righteous Abel until the hour of His passion, had
   departed in His love, waited in the world beyond the grave until He
   should break up the unseen gates of hell, and go before them into the
   paradise of God. Those who have since that day believed on Him, through
   the words of apostles, the writings of evangelists, the witness of His
   Church, the inspirations of His grace, the sacraments of His love, He
   has gathered in from the world into His visible fold, and within the
   visible circuit of His presence, ever nearer and nearer to Himself.

   What mean His own words? "Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are
   heavy laden, and I will give you rest:" and again, "Him that cometh
   unto Me, I will in no wise cast out:" what are these but invitations to
   come and to share the rest and the portion of St. John?

   What, for instance, is the state of those blessed servants, who, from
   their regeneration, have been kept from falling into sins which
   separate the soul from His presence? Of such St. John is an especial
   type, in his love, pureness, and perseverance. They have a calm,
   undoubting, unfearing confidence in the love and care of Christ; a
   quiet content and still strength, which others seldom attain. Such
   people have few cravings, no eagerness, a satisfied desire, and a
   restful spirit. The world thinks them languid and slow of heart; but
   their stillness is the surface of a depth, and their slowness the calm
   of an intense perception of their Master's love. They have no need of
   stirs and excitements, of strong words and vehement impulses; there is
   within them a vivid consciousness of love kindled from the bosom of
   their Lord, and returning to Him again.

   And so too, though in another manner, with penitents. It is not without
   meaning that, after He rose from the dead, He shewed Himself first, not
   to the disciple who leaned upon His bosom, but to the sinner who had
   washed His feet with tears. And she who first would but anoint His
   feet, was afterwards made bolder by His compassion, even to anoint His
   head. It is a divine seal upon the Gospel, that the special parables of
   love are the penitent son and the lost sheep. It is for them He seems
   to lay up all His tenderness for the weak and the wounded, the famished
   and desolate , The father falls upon the neck of the returning
   wanderer: the shepherd carries the lost sheep upon his shoulder. What
   are all these to teach us, but the divine tenderness of our Lord to
   penitents? After years of wayward and wilful disobedience, of
   headstrong and guilty provocation, of sullen and stubborn rebellion,
   when at the last they turn, He will embrace them in perfect love. They,
   too, know the calm and rest of His intimate presence. Their past life
   seems to have hurried by them like the riot of a tempest, or to be
   dispelled as the anguish of a frightful dream. They know what they have
   been, its horror and its peril, its iron bondage and its stifling
   misery. It is still so near, real, and vivid, that it affrights them to
   gaze upon it; but they have a consciousness that they are safe. An
   almighty power hangs between them and the past; there is a fence about
   them which nothing can break through j they are in a presence within
   which no evil can force its way. There they have found peace at last, a
   consciousness of inexhaustible compassion, a taste of everlasting love.

   But there are others who may be truly said to share the portion of St.
   John; I mean, the afflicted, whose afflictions are sanctified. The
   solitary and the sorrowing find there an unearthly rest: they carry
   their griefs and lay them on the bosom of the Man of Sorrows. He bears
   both the mourner and his burden, and in the depths of His presence
   shews him the interpretation of his affliction. In the Heart of His
   divine sorrow all stands revealed. We laid on Him the necessity of
   sorrow, and He changed our penalty into our purification. He became the
   chief among the sons of affliction, that He might found an order of
   mourners, to be His own especial followers and friends. It is by sorrow
   that they are enrolled in the company of His truest servants, and in
   the nearest approaches to Himself. And the signs of this approach are,
   patience, rest, and consent in all our crosses, by a will conformed to
   His.

   To take one more example. What is communion with Him in the Sacrament
   of His body and blood, but a leaning on His bosom in especial nearness?
   All His mystical body, in heaven and in earth, all devout and holy
   souls who have been united to Him in habitual fellowship of spiritual
   and sacramental communion, they, too, are numbered with the disciple
   whom Jesus loved. None know but they what passes between them and their
   Lord in hours of prayer, in silent adoration, in secret oratories, in
   lonely chambers, in the sanctuary and before the altar. Some have
   seemed to speak with Him as if He were unveiled--as if He stood visibly
   before them, and they were lightened by His presence: their whole soul
   has seemed to be united with Him, as light is one with its centre; and
   their whole being to forsake this world, and cleave to Him alone. It is
   good for us to know these things, that we may be awakened to a sense of
   their reality, and ashamed to live on unconscious of them: but they are
   too great and excellent for most of us j far above, out of our reach:
   not by His will, but through our earthliness. Yet we must not leave
   them unheeded, lest they should be disbelieved, and therefore never
   sought; but we must speak of them with fear, lest we be presumptuous or
   unreal, knowing what we are.

   The nearest approach, then, to the grace vouchsafed at the Last Supper
   to the disciple whom Jesus loved, is to be sought in the holy Sacrament
   which He then ordained. Was it to give us also a visible type of the
   gift which He then bestowed upon us, that He shewed this signal token
   of His love? Did it not seem to say, "This sacrifice of Myself shall be
   with you for ever: this Sacrament of My love shall never fail until I
   come again; and whensoever ye shall do this for My love's sake, I will
   receive all lowly, loving souls to rest in Me?"

   All these may be said to lean on Him who is their only strength, hope,
   and solace. In the midst of all sorrows, trials, and temptations, they
   are at peace; in all the unrest of this tumultuous and weary world,
   they rest on Him. They who have walked steadfast with Him from
   childhood, and live on unconscious of this rough outer life which beats
   upon the penitent; penitents who, after long wanderings past, find the
   peace and bliss of an eternal absolution; mourners who feel no more the
   burden of the cross, while He bears up both it and them; and all who
   with ardent desire yearn for the coming of His kingdom, and are stayed
   with "white raiment" and a sense of His ever-present love. The one
   great gift that all alike enjoy, is a sense of repose, a placid calm of
   heart, a stay upon which they lean with all the weight of their whole
   spiritual life. "Thou shalt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
   stayed on Thee, because he trusteth in Thee."

   Let us, then, seek this, so far as we may dare to approach Him. But how
   may we hope to share it?

   1. By knowing our own un worthiness even to sit down with Him at His
   table. It is no good sign to talk, as some do, with a bold familiarity
   of fellowship with Him, or to be forward to cast ourselves where the
   beloved disciple lay. Let us not "seek high things" for ourselves, the
   right hand and the left hand in His presence; we know not what we ask,
   and, not knowing, we ask amiss. To be unconscious of our unworthiness
   is to be blind or proud; and pride loses all. The lowest place is too
   high for us; to sit at His feet, or to gather up the crumbs under His
   table, is too great a boon: we must begin by taking the lowest room,
   that He may say unto us, "Go up higher;" lest our boldness meet a
   check, and He bid us give place to humbler and worthier guests. They
   are often nearest who think themselves farthest off; who say, not "I am
   ready to go with Thee to prison or to death," but "I am not worthy that
   thou shouldest come under my roof:" or with a guarded appeal, "Thou
   knowest that I love Thee." It is not for us to choose our place, except
   at the foot of the cross. That place is ours, for He has given it to
   us. Thither let us carry our sins, day by day, and there we shall see
   them as they are. There we shall learn the true sinfulness of sin, and
   the true character of our own life and heart. There are no illusions in
   the light of the cross; all the colours and shadows, the false play and
   changeful hues, the gloss and the glitter which we put upon ourselves
   in the sight of the world, and even in the light of our own conscience,
   are there overwhelmed by the direct and all-revealing splendour of His
   presence. He will not take to His intimate communion those who seem to
   themselves the fairest, but those who humbly seek to know the worst of
   their own hearts. Too deeply conscious of our sinfulness we cannot be.
   People often misinterpret this humbling consciousness. They are tempted
   to think that, because they feel themselves to be more sinful than
   before, therefore they are so. But it is mostly the direct reverse.
   They are, at the worst, what they always were; but they now feel what
   they never felt before. The change is not in their state, but in their
   sense of it. And that change of consciousness is a proof that if they
   are not what they were, it is not for the worse, but for the better.
   What once they so little sorrowed for or hated, that they did not even
   perceive it to be evil, they now in hatred and sorrow perceive with the
   keenest sense. And who is with them teaching them this knowledge? Sin
   hides itself. God alone reveals it. It is the nearness of His presence
   which wakes to life this alarming consciousness. "Whatsoever maketh
   manifest is light." The more unworthy we feel ourselves to seek
   fellowship with Him, the nearer He is to us. This very fear is the
   pledge of His presence: let us not shrink from it, but seek it; let it
   not affright us, but draw us nearer to our help.

   2. Above all, we shall attain such place as He sees fit to give us, by
   trusting His miraculous love. Who was it that lay in His bosom? Not the
   disciple who loved Jesus, but "the disciple whom Jesus loved." It was
   not the love of the servant which obtained that place, but the love of
   the Master gave it. So must it ever be. His love is "first and last."
   It is boundless and incomprehensible; surpassing nature, as His divine
   manhood is above ours; exceeding all measure, as His Godhead is above
   His manhood. It is an object of faith, as the mystery of the
   Incarnation. To doubt of His love to us, all sinners as we are, is to
   slight Him. It is to say, "Thou art an austere man." It is as if a
   child should cower and shrink in his father's sight; as if he should
   shun him and stand aloof, mistrusting the free, generous,
   self-forgetting affections of parental love. And these doubts of our
   Divine Master's love only darken and chill our own hearts; they
   overcloud the clear perceptions of His perfect character, and turn our
   own affections into coldness. His pity is no matter for bare intellect
   or reasoning, but for faith. As Peter went down to Him upon the water,
   simply trusting in His power, so must we draw near to Him in our sins,
   simply trusting in His love. Let us go to Him as sinners, leaving the
   rest to Him. If we may, to stand behind Him weeping is enough. Let us
   leave all deeper, higher things for those whom He shall choose. In a
   little time, it may be, through His tender, forgiving love, we shall
   have a share in their blissful rest. In a few short years, after a few
   more sorrows, a few more seasons of buffeting and weariness, after a
   few more fasts and prayers, a few more weak strivings, a few more
   longing communions, we shall sleep in Him, with all those who lean--not
   now on Abraham's bosom, in the rest of God--but on Him, the Word made
   flesh, in whom patriarchs, prophets, and all saints find refreshment.
   They lean upon Him in paradise, waiting for the day when our frail
   humanity shall be raised excellent in strength, and we shall be united
   to Him in peace and rest, sinless and deathless, in the glory of His
   Father.

SERMON XVII.

  THE UNITY OF LOVE.

    ST. MATT. xxii. 37-40.

   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
   soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment.
   And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."

   BY these words our Lord teaches us the unity of the kingdom of God.

   All the commandments of the Law, written in ten divine precepts on two
   tables of stone, expounded by an inspired lawgiver, and recorded in
   sacred books; all the precepts and commands of God's prophets, the
   greater and the less, and of all whose names and words pass before us
   in the history of Israel;--all this manifold body of divine injunctions
   for the government of man and for the worship of God, run up at last
   into these two simple and divine precepts: to love God with all our
   heart, and our neighbour as ourselves.

   For these two commandments have the same end and scope as all the law
   of Moses and all the words of the prophets; they contain the whole
   motive of universal obedience.

   And these two commandments in turn run up into a higher unity. For love
   is one and indivisible, a principle and gift of God. In these two
   commandments it is parted, indeed, into two heads, as two rays of light
   issuing from a common fount: two only in direction and relation, one
   altogether by an absolute unity of origin and nature.

   Let us see, then, how this manifold scheme of divine commands and of
   universal obedience has, at last, but one principle and law.

   And first, because "God is love." There is a divine depth in these
   words. They not only mean that God is loving, as when we say that He is
   wise or merciful, but that Love is God. For all that is in God is God.
   The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are not three names, but three
   Persons. Paternity, Filiation, and Procession is God the Father, God
   the Son, God the Holy Ghost. The Intelligence of God is His very Being;
   so also His Love, for God is a pure and perfect energy of love and
   knowledge.

   He said of Himself, "I am that I am." And our blessed Lord says, "I am
   the Resurrection and the Life." He means not only, "I will quicken and
   raise mankind from the dead," but "I am the Resurrection, and all rise
   in Me: I am the Life,' and all live in Me." So the Eternal Love is the
   Eternal God.

   And further, God's love is God's law. From all eternity He dwelt in His
   everlasting rest; not solitary, though with no like or second; for
   there are not two uncreated, nor two eternals: not alone, though in
   perfect oneness; for in one Godhead dwelt the ever-blessed Three in
   mutual love and bliss; the Father in the Son, the Father and the Son in
   the Holy Ghost; the Holy Ghost proceeding from both, dwelling in the
   Father and the Son, being the love of the Father and of the Son, the
   bond of the eternal Three.

   So dwelt the Eternal in His everlasting rest, until the uncreated Love,
   unmoved of any,--for there was none other,--moved only by Himself,
   began to create, that is, to give life of His life, and to inscribe the
   law of love upon the creatures of His will. Therefore He created "the
   heavens . . . and all the host of them;" [166] that is, holy angels,
   spirits of love and spirits of knowledge, and all the companies of the
   heavenly kingdom; thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers; and
   surrounded Himself with an hierarchy of blessed intelligences. These
   dwell in the depths of the inaccessible light, in the folds of the
   eternal love, loving, adoring, and ministering; and the law of their
   Creator is the law of their existence. They love God with all their
   strength, with all the energy of angelic natures; they love each other
   as themselves, with a perfect equality of pure and heavenly love. They
   are filled with the light of God's countenance, and they cleave to Him
   with a perfect adherence of their whole being. They are united in a
   mutual joy, and their delight is in the depth of an universal bliss.
   Such is the unity of God's law in His eternal kingdom.

   And that same love moved Him further to create the earth, and mankind
   upon the face of it. Man was made to love his Maker and his kind. God,
   in like manner, impressed on him this same law as the law also of his
   being. When man sinned against God, love moved Him again to redeem the
   world. God gave the Son of His love to be made man: the Son gave
   Himself to die. He gave also His Spirit to dwell in His redeemed. The
   whole work of the Spirit upon earth is a work of love, "gathering
   together in one the children of God which are scattered abroad,"
   bringing them back once more to the unity of the heavenly kingdom.
   There is a throne in heaven, and above it is the glory of the
   ever-blessed Three; and in the midst of the throne is the Word made
   flesh; and round about the throne, saints for whom He died; and round
   about the saints, angels who never were redeemed. And all that heavenly
   fellowship is ruled by this same one law: all are united by love to the
   King of saints, all are united to each other. Their whole being cleaves
   to Him. Every one loves the other as himself; the outermost in that
   blessed company loves the innermost with a love more perfect as each is
   nearer to the uncreated Love, and more beloved by Him.

   And this law holds not in heaven alone, but also upon earth; for we
   "are come," now in this present life, "unto mount Sion, and unto the
   city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem." [167] What is this but
   the company of heavenly hosts, at unity in itself? All the faithful
   upon earth, all believing, hoping, loving, penitent hearts in all
   lands, are gathered by this one law into the unity of the mystical
   body, and "grow up into Him . . . which is the Head." [168] The laws of
   the city of God run down to us. The unity of the heavenly Jerusalem is
   the source of the unity of the visible Church. It is one on earth,
   because it is one in heaven. It is one in heaven and earth, because it
   is united in one law. [169] Love is one of the names of Christ, and of
   His Church. Its visible body is the earthly clothing, the mystical
   impersonation of the love of God, in which all, whether visible or
   invisible, are united to Him as the Father is in the Son. The unity of
   love is a type of the unity of nature. Our Divine Redeemer prayed "that
   they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that
   they also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast
   sent Me. And the glory which Thou hast given Me I have given
   them;"--what glory, but the glory of love and unity?--"that they may be
   one, even as We are one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be
   made perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent
   Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me." [170]

   1. Let us learn, then, from this great mystery of life, that a soul
   without love is dead: for a soul without love is a soul without God;
   and as God is love, so is He life. By nature we were born dead in sin,
   because without love to God; but in baptism God gave us a capacity to
   love Him, an infused and passive habit, making us capable of love.
   Fallen spirits have lost this capacity, angels possess it in
   perfection. The regenerate receive it again in a passive disposition by
   the gift of the Holy Ghost. But that which is passively received must
   be actively unfolded. A capacity is not an active habit. The spiritual
   capacities of our regenerate nature, such as faith, hope, and love, are
   powers subject to the will, and depending on the will for their
   development into energy and act. But the soul in which the regenerate
   life is quenched or stifled has no love, and for lack of love is dead.
   It is parted from God by all the severance of moral and spiritual
   contradiction. It is cast out of the kingdom of love. As Adam, when he
   was driven forth out of Eden, had no more any lot in paradise, so the
   unloving soul is parted from God and Christ, from holy angels and from
   all saints, both in heaven and earth. Though all the companies of
   heaven are about him, he is solitary; for a loveless soul has no
   fellow. He has no inheritance in the city of God, no sympathy in the
   fellowship of the redeemed. They are united by love, and in that unity
   the unloving cannot abide. By love the souls of the faithful hang upon
   God, as the Psalmist says, "It is good for me to hold me fast by God;"
   "my soul hangeth upon Thee." [171] The soul that does not love looses
   its hold, and falls from the Divine Presence. As it recedes from God,
   it loses the light of His countenance. It for ever falls lower and
   lower; becomes darker and darker; grows colder and colder. First it
   falls under the dominion of self, next under the power of Satan; then
   it is bound over into the throng and thraldom of fallen angels. Take
   any example we will, and we shall find it always true: for instance,
   pride, anger, sullen jealousy, or a stubborn will; these sins drive the
   Spirit of God away. So, again, love of the world most surely makes men
   fall from Him: for "if any man love the world, the love of the Father
   is not in him." Sloth also, and pampering of self, wastes away the
   soul; it brings on fearful departures, and great losses of God's gifts
   and presence. What are all the tokens and ministries of grace to
   slothful hearts? They read holy Scripture, but it is a bare letter;
   they see the surface of the page, but not the light which lies beneath.
   Though they are sometimes moved with its sublimity and beauty, its
   power and pathos, yet it is only in the sensitive will and by the
   animal emotions. Feeling is not love; and with all this seeming
   religion, the spiritual life of such souls towards God is cold and
   dark. The same is true of their prayers, which are estranged and
   formal; and still more of their communions. An unloving heart before
   the altar is a sight of fear. All is empty, without form and void; and
   darkness is upon the face of it; but the Spirit of God does not move
   upon the face of those waters. Plain truths of the Spirit to such cold
   hearts are parables; parables are incomprehensible; mysteries have no
   significance, sacraments no meaning. All is darkness or formality, a
   hollow, heartless custom. Such a soul is truly and deeply parted from
   Christ, and under the apostolic sentence: "If any man love not the Lord
   Jesus Christ, let him be anathema maranatha."

   And if such be the state of loveless Christians in this life, what
   shall it be in the life to come? Shall they be near God there, who are
   far from Him here? Shall they be united to Him in eternity, who have
   cut themselves off from Him now in time? The separation which now is,
   shall then bring the doom of eternal loss. From the coldness and
   darkness of a loveless life, they fall still further from God into "the
   outer darkness." As the sight of God to them that love Him is the
   blessedness of heaven, so the loss of the beatific vision is the
   nethermost hell. Even in this life it begins to veil itself from
   unloving souls, but there they must be cast out from before His face
   for ever. And why is the lack of love so heinous in guilt, and a sin so
   fearfully avenged? Because a soul without love rebels against the whole
   law of God. As "love is the fulfilling of the law," so not to love is
   to break all the commandments at a blow.

   2. And we may hence also learn, that the least beginning of love in the
   soul is the seed of eternal life. As the least spark has the whole
   nature of fire, its intense heat and its perfect brightness, so the
   least pulse of love has in it, by virtue and principle, the whole
   nature of perfect love. There is no measure of ardent charity to which
   it may not be kindled. The love of the highest saint in the kingdom of
   heaven, where love is the law of order and exaltation, was once a faint
   beat, a weak motion of the soul. The fervent and active devotion of
   prophets and apostles was once but an infused capacity of spiritual
   life. So it may be with you. As the greatest have once been among the
   least, so the least may one day be among the greatest. The germ of a
   perfect love which shall adhere to the beatific vision in perpetual
   adoration, is, by God's gift, in every regenerate soul. As we will, so
   we shall live; and as we live, so we shall love. It is our life, the
   activity and direction of our living powers, that unfolds and perfects
   this divine capacity. And as love is a principle indivisible in its
   nature, so it is in its working and expansion. This shews us what is
   the law of its growth and development. The love of God, which has its
   centre in His eternal Being, spreads itself abroad with an even,
   all-embracing, universal fulness. All created beings are encompassed
   within the circles of its expanse; every sphere is replenished by it;
   heaven and earth are enfolded in its circuits; all in its own measure
   and degree, without disturbance or inequality. So with the love which
   He implants in His elect. As a spark swells into flame, and as its
   spire of light ascends, expands into a body of fire, full, even, and
   continuous, enlarging its reach and presence, ever moving outwards on
   all sides, yet ever flowing together in one equable symmetry and
   outline, preserving always its perfect unity; so love, which begins in
   the soul, at once moves upward and outward, to God and to our
   neighbour; growing with an even, simultaneous expansion; encircling
   first our kindred in blood, then our kindred in the spirit,--first
   father and mother, brethren and sisters, then neighbours and friends,
   members and servants of Christ, strangers and enemies; always ascending
   towards God, drawing the soul upward to His presence; uniting it to the
   person of our Redeemer, and through Him to all His elect. Love has no
   law but God's love. As He loves, so must we. They are the chiefest
   objects of our love who are the chiefest objects of His. All the love
   of His heavenly court is the reflection and response of His own. In the
   heavenly country they love even now as He loves: every one in his own
   order, in the measure of service, nearness, likeness, kindred to the
   King of saints. And to us wayfarers still on earth, there is no other
   law than that which descends from the eternal kingdom. "As He is, so
   are we in this world."

   3. And from this we may learn one more truth, that the unity and
   expansion of love is the cause and the law of unity and communion to
   the visible Church. This unity had its beginning upon earth in Him who
   is Love incarnate; from Him it spread and embraced His disciples,
   binding them in one visible fellowship, to which He imparted His divine
   commission. When He ascended into heaven, love was shed abroad in
   fulness by the coming of the Holy Ghost. The Love of the Father and of
   the Son was thenceforward manifest, not in a natural, but in a mystical
   body, which, from age to age, perfects itself by the inward working of
   its own principle of life. Its unity and growth are properties of its
   very being, descending from "the Head, even Christ: from whom the whole
   body, fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint
   supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every
   part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
   [172] It is, therefore, by its very nature and law, one and
   indivisible, ever enlarging, all-embracing; gathering in all nations,
   fusing all races, harmonising all tongues, blending all thoughts,
   uniting all spirits: making the earth once more of "one lip," of one
   speech, of one heart, and of one will. All the order of the Church; the
   spiritual relations of fatherhood and sonship, of brotherhood and
   mutual service; the communion of all grace and gifts, of sacraments and
   sympathies--all this is either the effect or the bond of an indivisible
   life. "There is one body and one spirit, even as ye are called in one
   hope of your calling: one Lord, one faith, one baptism," [173] one
   altar, one holy sacrifice, one divine tradition of corporate identity
   and living consciousness, sustaining the illumination of truth, seen by
   love alone, and itself sustained by the Holy Ghost. Therefore are all
   the members of Christ united in one visible family under "one God and
   Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."
   [174]

   Hence comes the sinfulness of schism: it is a sin against the
   indivisible love of God. To separate from the Church is to forfeit
   love; for love cannot be divided. Schisms do not rend it, but are rent
   from it. [175] As the life retires into the living trunk when branches
   are cut away, so love still dwells undivided in the life of the Church
   when members fall from its communion.

   And this shews also the sinfulness of an unloving spirit within the
   visible fold of the Church. I am not speaking only of strife, malice,
   and contention, but of the likes and dislikes, the estrangements and
   differences, by which the equable and calm spirit of love is grieved
   within the communion of the Church. We could as easily divide the
   daylight, and give to it uncertain and capricious inclinations, as
   divide the love which God implants by partialities and unequal
   distributions. As the sight of the eye, though intently fixed on one
   object out of all, yet embraces the whole visible horizon; so divine
   love in the soul, though it be fixed with all its force on God alone,
   yet embraces all around. Its very nature is expansion. It cannot
   exclude: to exclude any, is to destroy itself. Where love is at all, it
   will act always and every where, towards all persons, and under all
   circumstances of advantage or disadvantage, help or hindrance, at home
   or abroad. It is the very life of the soul. We could as well live by
   fragments, as love by partialities. Love can no more vary and change,
   come and go, single out one and slight others, be fervent afar off and
   cold at home, than life can exist by freaks and caprices towards this
   person or that, in this or that place, at this or that season. As our
   life pervades our whole nature, in body, soul, and spirit, all our
   actions and movements, all our thoughts and words; so love is the one
   ever-present, ever-active, informing, sustaining, quickening life which
   orders our whole spiritual being. If we love God, we shall love our
   neighbour. "He that loveth Him that begat, loveth him also that is
   begotten of Him." If we love not our neighbour, we love not God: "If a
   man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that
   loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he
   hath not seen?" [176] If we think to love one and hate another, we
   deceive ourselves; for "whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer:" a
   heart that can hate even one soul, can love no one. If we love them
   that love us, "sinners also love those that love them." No man can
   truly love God who does not love his friends; no man can truly love his
   friends who loves not strangers; and no one can love distant or
   indifferent persons who does not love his enemies.

   And this will give us a test which enters into our every-day life, our
   inmost heart and home. The first step in the ascent of love rises in
   our own dwelling. From our very threshold it goes up to the eternal
   throne. There too is "the house of God," and there "the gate of
   heaven." A heart unloving among kindred has no love towards God's
   saints and angels. If we have a cold heart towards a servant, or a
   friend, why should we wonder if we have no fervour towards God? Let us
   not deceive ourselves. It is very sweet and flattering to self to
   imagine ourselves in great works of devotion and charity; living at the
   foot of the cross, content with scanty fare and raiment, and the love
   of Christ alone: but if we are cold in our private prayers, we should
   be earthly and dull in the most devout religious order; if we shrink
   from the sick-bed of a servant, we should have no charity to turn the
   pallet of Christ's poor; if we cannot bear the vexations of a
   companion, how should we bear the contradiction of sinners? if a little
   pain overcomes us, how could we endure a cross? if we have no tender,
   cheerful, affectionate love to those with whom our daily hours are
   spent, how should we feel the pulse and ardour of love to the unknown
   and the evil, the ungrateful and repulsive? In all this we should be
   simply deceiving our own souls. What we are in one place, we should be
   everywhere; as uncertain and fastidious, as sensitive and capricious,
   as full of likings and dislikings, which are the leprosy of the heart,
   fretting its life away.

   The law of love had its perfect and uniform fulfilment in our blessed
   Lord, who is both man and God. In His words and works, His tones and
   accents, His calmness and majesty, His gaze and countenance, His
   obedience and patience towards all who loved or hated, served or
   thwarted, blessed or reviled Him; in all things, great and small, in
   all seasons of peace or agony, His love neither failed nor fainted. It
   was never chilled nor clouded: no ear ever heard His voice sharpened,
   no eye ever saw His brow grow dark.

   And how shall we fulfil this great law of two precepts, but by likeness
   to His Heart of love? and how shall we be likened to it, but by union
   with Himself?

   He shews us the perfection of divine charity: "Greater love hath no man
   than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." The
   perfection of love is sacrifice; the beginning of sacrifice is
   self-denial. "He pleased not Himself." He loved us, and gave Himself
   for us. He loved us even more than Himself. Let us pray Him to unite us
   to His own spirit, that His love may flow down into our hearts, and
   make us as He is. It is by spiritual contact and communion with Him
   that love is kindled; and the oftener we come to this fountain of
   heavenly fire, the more we shall be inflamed, and "His love perfected
   in us," until that day when, from this jarring and conflicting world,
   the Eternal Love shall gather in His own to that unity where there is
   no variance, to that communion which shall be for ever visible and one.
   In that world of light and peace all shall be loving, all beloved, all
   blessed in themselves, and doubly blessed, each in the other's bliss,
   in the pure sphere of joy where Love uncreated dwells, of whose
   boundless overflow all created life shall be filled eternally.

SERMON XVIII.

  THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS.

    REV. xiv. 1.

   "And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with Him an
   hundred forty and four thousand, having His Father's name written in
   their foreheads."

   THREE times this great vision was revealed to St. John. "And I heard,"
   he writes, "the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed
   an hundred and forty and four thousand." [177] "After this I beheld,
   and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations,
   and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and
   before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;
   and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth
   upon the throne, and unto the Lamb." [178]

   Again St. John writes: "I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with
   fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his
   image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the
   sea of glass, having the harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses
   the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and
   marvellous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are Thy
   ways, Thou King of saints." [179]

   And in this place: "And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount
   Sion, and with Him an hundred and forty and four thousand, having His
   Father's name written in their foreheads." [180]

   This is a revelation of things which shall be hereafter; an
   anticipation of the perfect fulfilment of the secret mystery of grace
   now advancing in the world.

   This blessed company seen upon mount Sion is the whole Church as it
   shall be, "without spot or blemish," gathered and glorious: the Head
   and the Body, the whole mystical Person of the Second Adam, the
   beginning and the fulness of the new creation of God.

   The hundred and forty and four thousand is a number divinely chosen to
   express the multitude of God's elect, as they are foreknown in the Book
   of Life; a number which stands as a symbol for a number unrevealed, as
   the stars of the heavens for multitude: the fellowship of all saints,
   from all ages and generations, of all families, races, and tongues.

   It reveals also the perfect unity of the whole mystical body. They were
   arrayed all alike, bearing each the palm of victors and their harps of
   praise, symbols of the divine ineffable unity of all God's saints. They
   chanted before the throne a new song, which no man but they could
   learn; and their voice went up all one, as the mingled voice of many
   waters.

   We have here the multitude and the unity of the saints of God. Though
   beyond all number, they were but one; having one bliss, one crown, one
   eternal energy of love and worship. This reveals to us the great
   mystery we confess in the Catholic faith: "I believe the Communion of
   Saints." Let us look into it awhile.

   1 . First, then, the Communion of Saints is the restoration of
   fellowship between God and man.

   God and man were united in the first creation as the substance and the
   shadow, the type and the likeness, the very and true original with its
   image and reflection. There was an unity of love and will between the
   Lord as He walked in Paradise, and the man whom He had made from the
   dust to dress the garden of Eden.

   But there was no union of the divine and human substance: neither was
   God man, nor man God; but God and man were each several and apart. The
   finite and the infinite, the created and the uncreated, were joined in
   no personal unity. The communion of God with man was external and
   perishable, hanging on the frailty of an infirm, created will.

   Sin dissolved that fellowship, and the creature fell into corruption.
   The will of God and the will in man were turned in variance, with the
   energy of direct contradiction. The whole soul of man rose in rebellion
   against God, and the whole majesty of God stood in array against the
   sin of His creature. And in this original revolt the race of man fell
   off from God, and gathered itself against Him. The multiplication of
   mankind was the multiplication and perpetuity of the conflict between
   God and man. There was no fellowship between heaven and earth; for the
   divine foundation had been broken up, and no new foundation had been
   laid.

   God, therefore, sent His Son into the world; "God was manifest in the
   flesh." God and man were united in one inseparable mystery; two whole
   and perfect natures in one person--the divine and human, the created
   and the uncreated--never to be again divided, never to be dissolved for
   ever; as a foundation of eternal communion.

   There are in the will and work of God three perfect and eternal
   unities: the unity of three Persons in one nature; the unity of two
   natures in one Person; and the unity of the Incarnate Son with His
   elect,--the Head with the members of His Body mystical.

   This is the foundation of the communion of God and man. "A Lamb stood
   upon mount Sion, and with Him an hundred and forty and four thousand."

   2. And next, the Communion of Saints is the restoration of the
   fellowship of men with each other. It is the mutual and universal
   fellowship of those who have fellowship through Christ with God.

   Sin, which dissolved the communion of mankind with God, dissolved also
   the fellowship of man with man. The will once turned against its divine
   Lord is turned also against all its like. The will in man, by its
   selfish intensity, turns every way, with the vehemence of a tempest.

   And therefore, by nature, we are isolated and isolating. Sin begets
   self-love; self-love destroys sympathy. Cain is the very type of our
   fallen race: bound by kindred, but without affections; herding
   together, but without a common soul: "Am I my brother's keeper?" [181]
   By our first birth into this world we have a common heritage of flesh
   and blood; but no communion, because no spiritual life: we have a
   common portion of death and sin; but no fellowship, because no head or
   centre. By nature we may unite in bonds of kindred, and in a material
   life of social order; but we can have no communion of spirit with
   spirit and of soul with soul. No imperfect person could unite us, or be
   our head. Every individual will born into this world is several and
   selfish, and therefore in conflict and division.

   Such is the natural state of man on earth; such are fallen angels, for
   whom is no Redeemer; and such will be the misery of hell,--the
   perfection of conscious isolation, banishment from God, and
   estrangement from universal being, loneliness in a throng, multitude
   without unity, discord and strife, sin carried out to its perfection;
   individual wills absolute in solitude, hateful, and hating one another.
   This is the nethermost hell.

   Such, then, are we by nature, and such is the eternity to which the
   impenitent are doomed.

   But, by the power of God, through the Incarnation of His Son, we are
   redeemed from our natural isolation, and, by union with Him, united to
   each other.

   Our regeneration unites us to the Divine Person in whom God and man are
   one; and by union with Him we are reunited to all whom He has likewise
   united to Himself. All the regenerate are partakers of one nature, the
   divine manhood of the Son of God, who, as God, is consubstantial with
   the Father; as man, is consubstantial with us. We are one with Him, as
   He is with His Father. As He is united with the Father, not by mere
   unity of likeness, or love, or will, but by a true participation of His
   Father's nature, "God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God;" so
   are we united with Him, not by mere unity of likeness, love, or will,
   but by a true participation of His divine humanity. And as we are
   united with Him, so with each other; not by mere moral affinity or
   intellectual agreement, nor by mere likeness of character or harmony of
   disposition; not by an outward figurative union, which changes
   communion into a play of the imagination, or a metaphor of
   unsubstantial notions. The members of Christ's body, both in heaven and
   earth, are united in a kindred as real as the bonds of blood, but
   higher than all earthly brotherhood, by a participation of one common
   nature, of a restored humanity, sinless and deathless, in the Person of
   the Second Adam. As the head and the body are of one substance, so are
   Christ and His saints. As the vine has one nature in root and stem,
   branch and spray, fibre and fruit, so the mystical and true Vine in
   earth and heaven has one substance and one life, which is the basis of
   all fellowship in love and will, in sympathy and action, in mutual
   intercessions of prayer, and in united ministries of power.

   All, then, who have communion in His visible Church, the evil and the
   good, the saint and the hypocrite, outwardly partake in this sacrament
   of inward unity. And the visible Church on earth is the root out of
   which the mystical vine is rising. Within it all holy hearts have an
   interior fellowship. The mystical Body has its supernatural life, its
   heaven-born soul, breathed into it on the day of Pentecost, sustained
   by a perpetual influence of Christ's living presence. And in this
   living soul all who believe, love, repent, obey, have fellowship. This
   expanding life for eighteen hundred years has been filling the world
   unseen with souls elect and purified. The communion begun on earth
   passes upward into heaven. Death cannot suspend it; the gates of hell
   shall not prevail against it. The mystical body in heaven and earth is
   one. As all rays are united in the sun, so "all spirits and souls of
   the righteous," before or since the Incarnation, are knit and united in
   one common centre--the person of the King of saints. "Ye are no more
   strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of
   the household of God: and are built upon the foundation of the apostles
   and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone; in
   whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple
   in the Lord." [182] "Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of
   the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company
   of angels, to the general assembly and church of the first-born, which
   are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits
   of just men made perfect." [183]

   "And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which
   are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him,
   Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of
   great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in
   the blood of the Lamb." [184]

   What may we learn, then, from these mysteries of the kingdom of God?
   They are not parables, but visions; not shadows, but realities; seen,
   indeed, by anticipation in their fulness, but actually fulfilling now.
   The Communion of Saints is not only that which shall be, but that which
   now exists. There is in the world unseen an unnumbered company which
   has sympathy with us on earth, and we with them are even now partakers
   of their heavenly work and worship. The whole book of Revelation, as
   its beginning is past, and its end is still to come, so all between is
   the history of the career and warfare of the Church on earth, and of
   the sympathy and communion of the Church in heaven.

   1. Let us, then, learn, first of all, that we can never be lonely or
   forsaken in this life.

   Our Lord has promised: "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of
   the world." And in Him all His saints are with us too. Where He is,
   they are; for they reign with Him; they "follow the Lamb whithersoever
   He goeth;" the armies which are in heaven "follow Him." The sympathy of
   the Son of God is with us; and His sympathy, as it is human in its
   tenderness, so it is divine in its perfection. As the anointing upon
   the head of the high priest ran down to the skirts of his clothing, so
   all the perfections of the Head of the mystical body flow down upon His
   members. They share His sympathy with the Church militant on earth.
   Shall they forget us because they are "made perfect?" Shall they love
   us the less because they now have power to love us more? If we forget
   them not, shall they not remember us with God?

   No trial, then, can isolate us, no sorrow can cut us off from the
   Communion of Saints. There is but one thing in which the sympathy of
   Christ has no share, and that is, the guilt of wilful sin. If we live
   sinfully, we isolate ourselves. Both heaven and earth alike will cast
   us out. We have no home or fellowship, for there is neither fellowship
   nor home where God is not. What wonder, then, if sinners are miserable?
   What wonder if they go up and down in a crowded solitude, under the
   conscious burden of their own loneliness? What more outcast than a
   proud, angry, false, revengeful spirit? Or who is more alone than a
   close hypocrite, who wears white that he may pass among Christians in
   the worship of the Church, and perhaps at the very altar? Or, again,
   what share in the kingdom of God have the soft and selfish, the refined
   and luxurious?

   The Communion of Saints has no sympathy for them, as they have no
   tokens of their Lord. The sign of saints is the cross of Christ.
   Somewhere it must be found stamped upon them, either in their outward
   life or their inward spirit, upon some affection or desire, upon some
   infirmity or fault, upon something willingly foregone or gladly given
   to another. Some mark of the cross there must be; for where no cross
   is, there is no communion. In all hard strife with sin and with the
   world, in all stubborn temptations and ever-returning trials, in all
   the sorrows of repentance, and all the sharpness of affliction, though
   without visible friends, we cannot be forsaken. Above all, they who
   labour for Christ and for His kingdom can never be alone. They are
   "workers together with God," and He is on the field of their daily
   toil: "His eyes are upon them all the year long." Angels and men in a
   wonderful order labour with them: unseen ministries are about them, and
   the great cloud of witnesses is intent upon their strife. So long as we
   are within the truth, be we never so lonely, all the kingdom of Christ
   is with us. Truth unites us with eternity. Outside of the truth, though
   we be in a multitude, we must be ever alone. But the laws of the
   kingdom are universal, reaching beyond time and the world, and bringing
   us into communion with all the servants and saints of the Most High.
   Sects and schools, individual judgments, private opinions, and the
   like, are selfish and solitary. But the faith is the common
   consciousness and life of the elect; and they who stand for it,
   although they stand alone against all the world, are never alone, for
   all the companies of heaven and all the generations of the Church are
   at their side. Kneel down, and you are with them; lift up your eyes,
   and the heavenly world, high above all perturbation, hangs serenely
   over head. Only a thin veil, it may be, floats between. When the
   prophet stood with his servant all alone in Dothan compassed with
   enemies, the whole mountain was full of the chariots of God. So all His
   holy ones, prophets, apostles, martyrs, saints, all His pure and
   perfect servants, compass His Church on earth. All whom we loved, and
   all who loved us; whom we still love no less, while they love us yet
   more, are ever near, because ever in His presence in whom we live and
   dwell. Awaken this blessed consciousness. Keep ever open your living
   fellowship with the Lord Jesus, who is the pledge of all sympathy, the
   channel of all fellowship, and the head of all communion.

   2. And let us learn further, by the reality of this heavenly
   fellowship, to live less in this divided world. Christ died for the sin
   of the world; but the hundred and forty and four thousand, a few from
   among many, are gathered out of it, and "the world lieth in
   wickedness." Every one of that perfect number, in his day, renounced
   the world, and died to it. There is an eternal opposition between the
   world and God. "The friendship of the world is enmity against God;"
   because the world is the kingdom of the flesh, and "the carnal mind is
   enmity against God: for it is not subject unto the law of God, neither
   indeed can be." If it became subject, it would cease to exist: enmity
   is its very existence. It matters not in what forms this may be
   embodied; whether in sensual or refined sins, in the grosser or the
   more cultivated forms of atheism; only that the grosser are often less
   guilty, and the cultivated are often more intense: or in luxury,
   self-worship, vain-glory, jealousy, wrath, scorn, rivalry, effeminate
   hardness of heart, and the like: it is all one before God. "Love not
   the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love
   the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the
   world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride
   of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world." [185] If we live
   in fellowship with the world, we have no fellowship with Christ. If we
   love the world, the love of the Father is not in us; and if no love of
   the Father, then no communion with His kingdom.

   Between these two we must make our choice. We are between two
   cities--the one visible, the other invisible--the one an object of
   sense, the other of faith--the one garish, splendid, and tumultuous,
   the other calm, glorious, and serene. On the one side, the world, and
   this earthly life, with its fair show, luring gifts, bright promises,
   gilded ambition; on the other, the city of God, the fellowship of
   saints, the sympathy of Christ, the love of the Father, the Beatific
   Vision.

   1

   Choose one you must. Either you must have a life--not sinful, or gross,
   or reckless, or profane--of these we are not speaking--but in this
   world, and of this world, loved by it, courted, followed, endowed,
   gifted, smooth, and fair, without sharpness or cross, without
   contradiction or shame, without devotion or self-denial, without
   saintliness or repentance; or you must have a life of striving and
   suffering, of temptation and weariness, of faith and faintness, of hope
   and fear, of longing and waiting, of anxious desires and slow tarrying
   answers; bearing the weight of a conscious immortality, with sins
   remembered in the conscience, and intentions pent up in the heart. One
   of these two you must choose to be your own. Either in this world "to
   have your reward," or to have your "life hid with Christ in God." For
   He has said, "I came not to send peace upon earth, but a sword;" and
   with that sharp two-edged weapon He is severing His own from this
   perishing world. He has been cutting all round you to set you free by
   His ministries of truth and grace, by warnings and chastisements, by
   blessings and visitations, by His words piercing the outward ear, and
   His presence moving your inward heart.

   Look back upon your past life. Retrospect will interpret it as a whole,
   and marshal all its parts in order. Through all your earthly trial He
   has had one steadfast intention, to bring you to Himself.

   3. And lastly, let us learn from this Communion of Saints to live in
   hope.

   They who are now at rest were once like ourselves. They were once
   fallen, weak, faulty, sinful; they had their burdens and hindrances,
   their slumbering and weariness, their failures and their falls. But now
   they have overcome.

   Their life was once homely and commonplace. While on earth they were
   not arrayed in white raiment, but in apparel like other men, unmarked
   and plain, worn and stained by time and trial. Their day ran out as
   ours. Morning and noon and night came and went to them as to us. Their
   life, too, was as lonely and sad as yours. Little fretful circumstances
   and frequent disturbing changes wasted away their hours as yours. Many
   a time their "feet were almost gone," their "treadings had well nigh
   slipped." They had their professions and business, their works and
   trades, their cares and burdens; they were fathers, mothers, masters,
   servants; rich or poor, learned or unlettered, even as you; their life
   was in a sheltered home, or in the glare of the noonday world; they
   lived either free from hard cares and toils, or worn down with labours
   and anxiety. There is nothing in your life that was not in theirs;
   there was nothing in theirs but may be also in your own.

   Only one thing there is in which we are unlike them: they were common
   in all things except the uncommon measure of their inward sanctity. In
   all besides we are as they; only it is now our turn to strive for the
   crown of life. And now, because our turn is come, we think some trial
   new and strange is come upon us; that God has changed His way, or sent
   us fewer graces and greater temptations.

   Let each one search, then, and see what is his especial sin, danger,
   and trial. And let him remember, that already, long ago, many a like
   sinner or sufferer has been gathered into the rest of saints. They have
   overcome, each one, and one by one; each in his turn, when the day
   came, and God called him to the trial. And so shall you likewise.

   Live, then, in this blessed fellowship. Ponder their examples and their
   lives: their infirmities, for your encouragement; their masteries, for
   your humiliation. And now, how peaceful are they, and secure; how full
   of rest and God. Make sure your lot in their inheritance in light. All
   around you, God is gathering out His own, making up the number of His
   elect. All around, the world is ripening to the rankness of corruption.
   The world is falling, because it is divided from God, and against
   itself; the Communion of Saints is rising heavenward, because it is
   united in conscious unity with itself and with its Head.

   Before long, we too shall be without sin. The longest life, how short.
   The fairest earthly bliss, how poor. A few short years, and all will be
   over. Then there shall be no more sin and jar, no more infirmity and
   imperfections: then we shall have the power to taste of bliss, and to
   endure the taste.

   Then cometh the end. O what a day, when the earth and the heavens shall
   give token of His coming. When you shall lift up your heads and say,
   "Is this the end of all? Is it come at last?" O what an hour, when He
   shall come, and all His holy angels, and all the children of the
   kingdom: all who have loved, served, waited, suffered for Him: the
   first and the last, all in perfect sameness, recognition, bliss, and
   splendour; their raiment white and glistering, and their countenance as
   the sun shineth in his strength. O vision of majesty and beauty, when
   the holy city shall come down from God out of heaven, and a great voice
   shall say, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will
   dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be
   with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from
   their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
   crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are
   passed away." [186]

SERMON XIX.

  THE SEALING OF THE ELECT.

    REV. vii. 2, 3.

   "And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of
   the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to
   whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the
   earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants
   of our God in their foreheads."

   SIX of the seven seals had been already opened before the prophetic
   vision of St. John, and both heaven and earth were filled with the
   tokens of God's last judgment upon the world. "There was a great
   earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon
   became as blood;" and voices went up from the earth in terror and great
   fear, saying "to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from
   the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the
   Lamb: for the great day of His wrath is come j and who shall be able to
   stand? And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four
   corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the
   wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree:"
   that is, in vision, where time and space are not, St. John saw the
   whole face of the earth as it lies expanded before the eyes of God. He
   saw the scourges of God gathered to the full, ready to burst upon
   mankind; and four angels, the ministers of the justice of God, holding
   back the powers of divine retribution for a time appointed. And
   afterwards he saw "another angel ascending from the east," the minister
   of God's grace and mercy--the harbinger of the day-spring, the bright
   and morning star--"having the seal of the living God," that is, the
   power and commission to mark off, with a signet of salvation, the
   number of God's elect. "And he cried with a loud voice," laying a
   divine command upon the destroying angels, that they should stay their
   work till the elect should receive the seal of the living God. There
   was a suspense in heaven and earth until the work of grace should be
   accomplished. "And I heard," writes St. John, "the number of them which
   were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four
   thousand."

   In this majestic vision we have clearly revealed to us, not only some
   special action of the kingdom of God in judgment and in mercy, but also
   a revelation of the continuous exercise of His sovereignty of grace.

   This awful transaction is not an event of time past, though, as in a
   type and prelude, it may have had already a fulfilment; neither is it
   an action simply in time to come, as if it were not yet in operation,
   though, doubtless, it will be once for all accomplished when, under the
   suspended judgments of the last day, the angels shall go abroad to
   gather His elect from the four winds of heaven. There is here revealed
   to us a divine idea, and a divine law of action, which is now advancing
   with perpetual energy, past, present, and to come.

   It reveals to us the state of the world, doomed by God's righteous
   sentence, but spared for a while till the work of God is done. It shews
   us:

   1. First, that God has a foreknown number whom He will gather out unto
   Himself.

   In the foreknowledge of God all is eternally perfect and complete.
   There is no succession in the eternal mind. All His works stand perfect
   in their first and final type; each one a whole and perfect idea,
   eternally conceived, willed, accomplished. Even now, in the Divine
   foreknowledge, the mystery of redemption is beheld in its fulness. To
   Him who "calleth those things which be not as though they were," it now
   is as to us it shall be. The whole of the new creation sprung from, and
   surrounding, the second Adam in the kingdom of life eternal; the
   mystical Person of Christ, both the Head and the Body, all perfect "by
   that which every joint supplieth;" the true and eternal Vine, complete
   in all its symmetry from root to spray; the heavenly court, compassed
   about with ranks of angelic hosts: the order of patriarchs, and the
   multitude of saints, ascending to the Mother of God and to the
   Incarnate Son: all this divine and glorious mystery of miraculous love
   and power stands in the foreknowledge and gaze of the Eternal, full,
   perfect, and accomplished. Time is not with God, save as He works in
   time. Time is subject to the Divine intent. Time waits upon His will,
   and serves it; and then, as the Divine purpose is fulfilled, ceases to
   exist. What is with us gradual and successive, with God is absolute and
   complete. The series and unfolding of creation and redemption to us are
   progressive, to Him are one symmetrical and perfect whole, on which the
   Divine will and gaze is fixed.

   Before creation, God dwelt in His eternal rest, blissful in Himself, in
   His own goodness, power, and love; and into the same rest He will
   return again when all the works of creation and of redemption shall be
   exhausted, and the fruit of them gathered in. Until then, all power in
   heaven and in earth is given unto the Son. But when all is accomplished
   in time, then shall the Son also Himself, with all His elect, the
   hundred and forty and four thousand in perfection and in unity, "be
   subject unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may be all in
   all." When that predestined hour is come, all orders and ranks of
   sinless creatures, angels, archangels, virtues and dominions, thrones,
   principalities, powers, cherubim, seraphim, and the mystical body of
   the Word made flesh, shall dwell together in the eternal rest before
   the face of God. This is the end for which all is ordained, to which
   all conspires, for which all things are waiting.

   2. We see further, that the course of this world will run on until this
   foreknown number shall be gathered in. All things are for the elect's
   sake. For their sake the world standeth; for their sake the last
   judgments are held back; "for their sake these days shall be
   shortened." "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men
   count slackness; but is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any
   should perish, but that all should come to repentance." [187] But
   though God's work in creation was simultaneous, His dominion in
   providence is progressive. He has ordained the generations of mankind
   in a successive order; and from each succession, as it comes up, He
   gathers out those whom He hath foreknown. Meanwhile the world runs on
   its course. The power of sin, which entered in the beginning, casts
   itself into a thousand forms, lifts itself in enmity against God,
   moulds the fallen creatures of God into endless shapes of provocation,
   and wages a perpetual rebellion. Mankind had hardly multiplied upon the
   earth, when the world was ripe for destruction; wrath was long
   threatened, and yet long held back. It is withheld still for the sake
   of the elect. What is the history of the world, but a history of man's
   warfare against God? of our provocation, and of His patience? What are
   the religions, philosophies, kingdoms of the old world, but idolatry,
   atheism, rebellion? What are they now? What is philosophy without
   faith, civilisation without Christianity, education without moral laws,
   empires owning no omnipotence but their own, wars without justice,
   wealth desecrated, refinement without the cross? And what are the
   traditions, characters, and moral life of the nations, people, and
   masses of our Christian world? What is the state of the whole world at
   this hour? Two -thirds heathen or infidel; and of what remains of the
   old wreck of Christendom, what judgment is recorded in heaven? What
   hatred and enmity, what mockery and provocation, what schisms and
   heresies, what spiritual revolts and national apostacies, what
   challenge and defiance of the long-suffering of God and of His Christ!

   Why, then, "tarry the wheels of His chariots?" They "are twenty
   thousand," "more than twelve legions of angels." Why do not the armies
   of heaven ride forth on white horses to avenge the name of their Lord
   upon a hardened and hopeless world? Why are the four mighty whirlwinds
   yet stayed? What holds them from blowing upon the earth? They are hound
   by the hands of the Divine patience, only till the servants of God are
   sealed in their foreheads.

   3. And this shews us, once more, that even now, while judgment is
   stayed, the Church in the midst of us is sealing God's elect.

   The angel ascending from the east is a type of the ministry of angels
   and men knit together in one order of grace, to gather out the heirs of
   salvation. Ever since the world began, this invisible work of mercy has
   been carrying on. "One has been taken, and another left." Abel was
   sealed, and Cain cast out; Enoch "was not, for God took him:" and they
   are types of the ingathering of God's secret ones from the ruin of the
   elder world. So afterwards, Noah and Abraham, Melchisedech and Job, the
   saints of Israel, every tribe in its own order, from generation to
   generation, yielding up its remnant to be sealed with the seal of God.
   In the darkest times of God's Church of old there were found seven
   thousand men who had not fallen away: even at the last, when the holy
   city had become an harlot, and sects and factions in the Church of God
   crucified the Lord of glory, there were still saints hidden from the
   world, "waiting for the consolation." Their feet wore the threshold of
   the temple; and they knelt, day by day, unknown before the altar.

   So, too, in every age till now. In times of persecution, heresy,
   apostacy, or in earthly peace, splendour, and dominion, the Church has
   been gathering out God's chosen servants from all nations and from all
   lands, from all families and households, here one and there another,
   one by one, sealing each individual soul, as if there were no other in
   the presence of God.

   The visible polity of the Church, its stately ritual and public
   solemnities, its fasts and feasts, its chants and litanies, its
   missions and preachings, all the public order and movement which meets
   the eye and the ear,--all this is as the "not let down into the sea,
   which taketh of every kind, both good and bad." But this is not the
   sealing of the elect. It is an inner work of grace, a choosing from
   among the chosen, a preparation for that day, when, upon the eternal
   shore, the angels "shall gather the good into vessels, and cast the bad
   away." There are, therefore, two special truths to be noted in this
   matter, lest we deceive ourselves.

   The first is, that the ultimate and true election of God is not
   collective but several, not of bodies but of persons. The national
   election of Israel was a type of the Catholic election of the Church;
   the Jewish election was the personal election of Abraham enlarged, and
   the Catholic election is the visible ministry of grace for gathering in
   the heirs of Abraham's faith. The visible Church is elect for the
   elect's sake. It was this great mystery of grace of which St. John
   Baptist spoke, when he said, "Think not to say within yourselves, We
   have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of
   these stones to raise up children unto Abraham." [188] Their national
   or traditional election would not save them; nothing but the personal
   and individual election of grace. So with the visible Church of Christ.
   "Many are called, but few are chosen." The world-wide tradition of
   baptism gathered into the visible election of the Church, first
   individuals, one by one, then households, then families, races,
   nations, all alike gathered into the way of life, and within the sphere
   and powers of the world to come, sealed all alike with the outward seal
   of confessions and sacraments. But what do we see all around? what does
   every age of the Church attest, every land in Christendom, every
   portion of the Church? The baptised are many, holy hearts are few; many
   called to be Christ's, few chosen; many regenerate, few sons of God;
   much sowing, little reaping; much planting, but a scanty vintage. Let
   this teach us to look deeper than our baptism and our creed: both are
   of God, and both necessary to eternal life; but neither, nor both,
   suffice alone. Let us search below the passive Christianity of our
   childhood, and the visible election we share with the inconsistent and
   unconverted. Nations do not inherit the kingdom of God as nations, nor
   do households as households enter into life; but each several soul, as
   it is born into this world alone, is ever lonely before God: even in
   the throng of multitudes, when we fall down before God in worship
   before the altar, when we adore Him in united chants, and in fullest
   communion, with a voice as of many waters; yet even then each soul is
   several and alone, standing or falling by itself, bearing the weight of
   its own immortality, with the burden of its sins and graces, its gifts
   and responsibilities, its time past, present, and to come. Born alone,
   alone we must live; alone repent, pray, fast, watch, persevere, and
   die; each one for himself "work out his own salvation," and make his
   "calling and election sure."

   And the other truth is, that this mystery of election, as it is
   personal, so it is strictly consistent with our personal probation.
   Strange that they who believe the eternity of God should entangle
   themselves in questions about predestination. Once believe an Eternal
   Mind, and we have ascended into a sphere of faith where all things are
   transcendent. We can no longer reason by terms of logic or by
   definitions in words. If God be omniscient, must He not foreknow all
   things? and if He be omnipotent, why can He not create free agents. Who
   are we to set His perfections in contradiction? But it is plainly
   declared, not more by words of holy Scripture than by the whole
   revealed character of God, and the universal consciousness of man, that
   every several soul is a free moral being, responsible for the powers
   and will with which he is divinely endowed, and for the acts and words
   which issue from them.

   On whom did St. John see the angel impress the seal of the elect? On
   the servants of God; that is, on those who were found faithful, each
   one in his place fulfilling his Master's work. The parable of the
   talents is a key to the name servant.' It is the title of those who,
   having received the grace of their Lord to lay out in His service, use
   what is entrusted to them with care and diligence: it describes the
   state of the regenerate, and the law of their probation.

   After years well spent in faithful service, when the will and heart are
   ripened by trial into steadfast faith and love, then, in His mercy, God
   bestows a crowning gift upon His servants--the grace of perseverance.

   There is an interior ministry of the Spirit, ever working, sealing by
   an inward and divine seal the proved servants of Christ: not by a
   capricious or mechanical predestination, but by an election founded on
   the moral attributes of God and on the moral nature of man. God made
   man free, and elects him to and in the exercise of freedom, will, and
   power. And what is this seal of the living God, but the image of God
   renewed in the soul by the power of the Holy Ghost; the likeness and
   the mind of Christ stamped upon us by a perfect regeneration; the
   inward reality of a saintly spirit wrought in us, either by a life of
   steadfast obedience or by a true repentance, by a persevering grace or
   by a perfect conversion?

   This work of grace is now, by the ministry of the Church, fulfilling
   all around, and will work on unseen unto the end. Then, when the
   mystical number is accomplished, and every soul foreknown has received
   the seal of God, the seventh and last seal of the Book shall be opened,
   and the scourges of God, long pent up, come down upon the earth.

   Ask yourselves, therefore, whether or no you are of this secret number?
   whether or no you have received this seal of God?

   What else is worth living for? Though you should have all, and not this
   alone, what shall it profit in the day of judgment? Though you have
   nothing else but this alone, what shall you then desire?

   But how shall we try ourselves? By what tokens shall we discern the
   hope of our election? Not by any external signs, nor by any
   supernatural intimations, nor by resting upon absolute decrees and the
   like; but by the deep inward marks of the work of God in us, by the
   correspondence of our spirit with the will and working of the Spirit of
   God. Let us, then, try ourselves by some plain questions of
   self-examination.

   1. The first question to ask ourselves is, What is our character? This
   very word, which we so habitually use, signifies a stamp impressed upon
   our spiritual nature. It is the counterpart of sealing. And we use it
   to signify the whole outline of our moral being. Character is to the
   heart what countenance is to the features: it is the form and shape
   into which the affections, powers, and actions of the will have been
   cast and moulded. And this inward shaping is always at work. We are
   from childhood between two strong powers--this world and the world to
   come; and both exert a strange and searching influence, according as we
   turn our hearts towards them. To the one or to the other we are being
   surely likened. Therefore St. Paul says, "Be not conformed to this
   world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind." [189]
   Either we are perpetually changing into a worldlier, earthlier soul, or
   we are being changed by union with Christ "into the same image from
   glory to glory." [190] When we speak, then, of character, we mean the
   clear, conscious, and definite shape and direction which has been given
   to our whole spiritual nature.

   How many people never ask themselves what shape their mind and spirit
   have assumed. How many live on unconscious that they are being either
   sealed or branded; that they are daily fixing their eternal state. Yet
   surely it is no hard thing to find out whether we are living in any
   known sin or not; whether we are striving against temptations or not;
   whether we have mastery over our faults or our faults over us; whether
   we desire the love of God or not; whether sin is to us a sorrow, and
   the very thought of holiness a delight; whether we are living for this
   world or for the next. Surely it can be no hard thing to answer these
   questions, nor to find whether we are taking as our example the
   character of the world or the character of Christ; the tone of society
   or the sermon on the mount; the maxims of worldly wisdom or the eight
   beatitudes; whether we follow the majority of Christians or the company
   of saints, the plausible and pleasant religion of social life or the
   severe and lonely spirit of the cross.

   Perhaps we are forced to confess that this higher character is so
   faintly traced upon us, that we hardly dare to claim it; then let us
   ask ourselves another and a more lenient question.

   2. If we have not this character, what are our tendencies? To what do
   our desires, aspirations, thoughts, incline? To what does our will
   tend? If we dare not say that we are penitent or devout, dead to self
   and to the world, can we say that such is our tendency? that we are
   moving, be it ever so slowly, in that direction? If we look back on a
   number of years, do we seem to have moved at all in that direction? Has
   sin been losing hold, and the spirit of sanctity gaining power over us?
   Are our temptations weaker, and we stronger; our faults fewer, and our
   repentance deeper? Or, to take any one besetting sin, do we less often
   fall into it, more quickly rise from it, hate it more keenly, and
   humble ourselves more sorrowfully? Or, to take any one work of charity
   or devotion, do we give ourselves to it with a fuller, freer, and more
   generous heart? Are our prayers less wandering and irksome? Is crossing
   our own will easier? The service of the sick, the care of the poor, the
   instruction of the ignorant is it more soothing and pleasant? Do we
   exercise ourselves in meditation on the person, presence, and love of
   our Lord, on the purity and bliss of His kingdom, with greater desire
   and joy? By some such questions we shall see whither we are tending,
   and to what we are being conformed.

   But it may be that we may be forced to give sorrowful answers to these
   questions, and to say that we feel neither holier nor humbler, more
   devout or penitent, than we did. And yet it is probably true that we
   are moving steadily onwards in the path of life; for the changes of our
   spiritual nature are like the changes of our stature, so slow as to be
   insensible: it is only after some years of growth that its advance can
   be perceived and measured; nevertheless the tendency is steady and
   unceasing. So with sincere hearts; the outline of the mind of Christ is
   ever shaping and deepening within them. It often happens that the more
   it advances, the less they perceive it, that the increase of inward
   sanctity conceals itself, and shews only by an intenser light the
   sinfulness of their sinful hearts: so that the less sinful they grow,
   the more sinful they see themselves to be; that is, the more truly they
   see both what they have been and what they are. And by this they are
   often cast down, not daring to believe that the increased sense of sin
   is an increase of sanctification: but this is a sure token which way
   their whole spiritual nature is tending.

   3. The last question we may ask is, What is our habitual intention?
   What, at your best seasons of recollection, is your deliberate aim? In
   times of sadness, sickness, anxiety, or in moments of prayer and
   devotion, what do you choose before all as the object of your supreme
   desire? At such seasons you feel the emptiness of time and the
   substance of eternity; you would give the whole world to save your
   soul; you would rather die sevenfold than sin once mortally; you would
   choose the love of God rather than all His gifts; to be numbered among
   His elect here in this world, albeit with repentance, hardness,
   solitude, temptation, and the cross, rather than to taste all
   sweetness, and possess all gifts of life, with a doubtful perseverance.
   At such times, it may be, your one great desire is to be sealed with
   the seal of the living God. And yet at other times you are conscious of
   sinking into a life so easy and forgetful, so unconscious of your one
   great aim, and so in harmony with this earthly state, that the higher
   tone seems to be artificial, and the lower to be your true tendency and
   character.

   Now to this it may be said, Take courage. The true self of sincere
   minds is that which speaks and aspires in their better moments. The
   lower level on which they move at other times is the way of their
   infirmity. As the resistance of the atmosphere stays the keenest
   arrow's flight, and bends it to the earth again, so the purest and
   directest intention is slackened by the gross thick airs of our daily
   life. Not to sink into a slower, earthlier motion is the portion of
   those who are lifted into a higher and heavenlier sphere, where the
   actings of the soul have nothing to resist them. In heaven "they rest
   not day nor night;" but on earth the most unresting intention is
   overcome by weakness and weariness at last. It cannot always be
   conscious and actual; but that does not take away its true and habitual
   reality.

   Let this, then, be your continual endeavour, to uphold and to prolong
   these higher intentions. He who inspired them will sustain them. These
   heavenward aspirations are not the emotions of nature, but the
   stirrings of grace, which, as it descended from heaven, so always
   strives to ascend to heaven again. Quicken and strengthen these desires
   by a life of prayer, by meditation, by habitual communion, by
   self-examination, by confession; by exercises of the heart, and by acts
   of faith, hope, and love. A soul united to God is endowed with the gift
   of perseverance; a will restored to its true freedom, hating sin, and
   delighting in the presence of Christ, shall be steadfast eternally; a
   heart kindled by the Holy Spirit is "sealed unto the day of
   redemption."

   Every day this work is advancing, and the impression of the saving sign
   sinks deeper and deeper in those who serve Him. It matters not where or
   what we are, so we be His servants. They are happy who have a wide
   field and great strength to fulfil His missions of compassion; and they
   too are blessed who, in sheltered homes and narrow ways of duty, wait
   upon Him in lowly services of love. Wise or simple, gifted or slender
   in knowledge, in the world's gaze or in hidden paths, high or low,
   encompassed by affections and joys of home or lonely and content in God
   alone, what matters, so that they bear the seal of the living God?
   Blessed company, unknown to each other, unknowing even themselves; not
   daring to believe what they would die to gain; hoping against hope;
   hopeless in themselves; hopeful ever, because their Lord is patience,
   pity, and love. Blessed and numberless fellowship, from Abel until now;
   some in the world unseen, already sealed and sure; some yet scattered
   in all lands, of every tribe and tongue, most diverse and manifold in
   state, lot, and trial, yet all of one character, one stamp, one
   seal,--the image of the Son of God. In a little while, a few short
   years, it may be, and all will be over. We shall then know what now we
   hardly dare to hope. Our election will be revealed, the mystery of
   God's elect accomplished, the world tried out in patience and
   long-suffering, in love and justice. Then cometh the end, when the
   angel of grace shall no longer stay the judgment of the earth. In that
   hour, before the face of the Lamb, who shall be able to stand? Be we
   among the quick or dead, may we "find mercy of the Lord in that day."

SERMON XX.

  THE RESURRECTION.

    ST. JOHN xi. 25.

   "I am the Resurrection."

   ALL the titles of our Lord are names of power. They express His nature,
   perfection, or prerogatives; what they declare, He is. They are shadows
   of a divine substance. He who is Very Life raised Himself from the
   dead: "I am the Resurrection." So He had declared before: "I give My
   life for the sheep. . . . No man taketh it from Me. . . . . I have
   power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again." [191] After
   His week of passion, He lay down to rest, having taken both sin and
   death in their own snare. Sin crucified Him, and death received Him
   into the grave. By His death He destroyed sin; by His rising again He
   abolished death; breaking up the snares in which He had given Himself
   to be entangled. His resurrection reveals the mystery of His Godhead
   and of His Incarnation. From the hour of the Annunciation, Godhead and
   manhood were in Him eternally united. When He gave up the ghost upon
   the cross, His human soul and His human body were parted asunder, as in
   the common death of man; but both soul and body were still united with
   His Godhead. His human soul went down into the abode of departed
   spirits. All who, from righteous Abel until that day, had waited for
   the revelation of the Redeemer--patriarchs, who had the promise of His
   coming, and prophets who foretold it--then at last beheld Him. Abraham,
   who afar off saw His day, and was glad, then saw His very presence. All
   His saints of old, with the penitent absolved upon the cross, beheld
   the divine seed of the woman, and entered with Him into the paradise of
   God. Meanwhile His sacred body, lying in the grave, pure and
   incorruptible, united still with His Godhead, waited the appointed
   hour. On the first day of the week His glorious soul returned to His
   pure flesh, and His manhood, whole and perfect, through the power of
   His Godhead, arose of His own will. He woke up as from rest in sleep;
   He came back the very same, and yet the same no more. The dishonour of
   His holy passion had passed away, but its tokens still were there.
   Though His sacred flesh was no more torn and stained by thorns and
   scourges, yet the signs of His cross were there. The five hallowed
   Wounds are still imprinted on His glorious and immortal manhood. They
   are "the wells of salvation" to His elect, the fountains of light and
   love to the world of the redeemed.

   And as in body, so in soul. He was no more the Man of sorrows, no more
   sorrowing unto death, no more in anguish, no more in agony of spirit,
   but calm, blissful, majestic. Death had no more dominion over Him; yet
   He was full of sympathy, learned by dying. All the depths of His human
   experience were in Him still. His past life of humiliation; the sorrows
   which, as God, He could never taste; the knowledge of our inheritance
   of pain, learned at Nain and Bethany, in the upper chamber and in
   Gethsemane; all this still lived in His divine consciousness. "He
   learned obedience by the things which He suffered;" and the ineffable
   mystery of His three and thirty years of sorrow rose with Him from the
   grave.

   Wherefore this divine name, as it reveals the power of His own
   resurrection, so it is the pledge of ours. As He raised up Himself, so
   He will raise us likewise. He is our resurrection: "Because I live, ye
   shall live also." "In Him is life, and the life is the light of men."
   "As the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He given to the Son to
   have life in Himself." "As the Father raiseth up the dead, and
   quickeneth them; so the Son quickeneth whom He will." [192] For like as
   the seed contains the harvest, and the power of a multiplying life ever
   rising from itself; and as the sun draws up after it the lights of the
   morning and the splendours of the day, so, because He is risen, we
   shall rise. As His Godhead and manhood are united in one divine person,
   so we and the Lord of the resurrection are united in one mystical body.
   A living head must needs have living members; and a Head that is risen
   must raise His members in due season: at that day when "He shall come
   to be glorified in His saints" in the fulness of His kingdom. Our union
   with Him, therefore, is no figure or metaphor, but is truth and spirit,
   reality and life. He is our resurrection.

   This divine Name, then, is a pledge to us of many joys; but chiefly of
   three divine gifts.

   1. The first is a perfect newness of body and soul. This is a thought
   of wonder almost beyond conception or belief. Death and the forerunners
   of death have so fast a hold upon the body; sin and the soils of sin
   pierce so deep into the soul, that the thought to be one day deathless
   and sinless seems to be a dream. Who has ever felt in THE RESURRECTION.
   [SERM.

   himself the working of sickness, or watched over it in others--who has
   ever seen it withering, wasting, crippling, deforming, dissolving the
   fairest and the strongest--baffling all skill of man, and all power of
   healing,--and not felt as if the body were a spoil given up for ever to
   the grave? People believe, indeed, that we shall rise again, not
   disembodied, but clothed in a bodily form; but do they realise that
   they shall rise again with their own bodies, in their very flesh,
   healed and immortal? Do they, as they hang over the clouded and
   darkened form of those whom they have loved, say, "I believe the
   resurrection of the body, of this very frame, made new in the kingdom
   of God?" And yet this is pledged to us. This very body shall be
   deathless and glorious as the body of His glory when He arose from the
   dead.

   And so, too, of the soul. It shall be still more glorious than the
   body, even as the spirit is above the flesh. The more we know of
   ourselves, the more incredible, if I may so speak, for very
   blessedness, this promise seems. To be without sin, what else is
   heaven? And can it ever be that we, who brought sin with our life-blood
   into the world,--who have fallen and soiled ourselves through and
   through with wilful evil,--that we shall be one day clear as the light,
   and white as the driven snow? Yet this is His pledge to us. To believe
   it is even harder than to believe the mysteries of the Incarnation. For
   these are objects of the intellect, a faculty comparatively pure; but
   here it is the heart which must believe of itself that it shall be one
   day sinless. Our consciousness seems to rise up and say, "It is
   impossible." What must we feel, as penitents remembering sins
   unnumbered and coldly repented; or as tempted and fearfully inclined
   towards our own destruction; or burdened and conscious of the inward
   taint and susceptibility of all spiritual disorder,--what must we feel
   at the thought that one day in all our conscience there shall not be a
   blot, in all our affections there shall not be a blemish, in all our
   will there shall neither be a shadow of variance with the will of our
   Lord, nor a moment's relaxation of our love and worship?

   To be ourselves the subject of this miracle of love and power; to be
   personally and inwardly restored to a sinless perfection, and raised to
   the glory of an endless life, as if death and sin had never entered, or
   we had never fallen,--is among those things which we almost "believe
   not for joy." This is the first divine gift pledged to us by the
   resurrection of our Lord.

   2. Another gift also pledged to us is the perfect restoration of all
   His brethren in His kingdom. "Father, I will that they also, whom Thou
   hast given Me, be with Me where I am; that they may behold My glory."
   [193] "I go to prepare a place for you. . . . . I will come again, and
   receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also." [194]
   From His eternal throne "He shall see of the travail of His soul, and
   shall be satisfied." "He shall see His seed," [195] and they "shall
   serve Him," [196] "and His name shall be in their foreheads." [197] He
   and all His servants from the beginning of the world shall be there
   united; all His patriarchs and prophets, all His martyrs and apostles,
   all His saints and penitents, all the companies and orders of life, all
   the hosts and armies of heaven, each one perfect as Himself, shall be
   gathered in His presence. We shall be "with Him." We shall behold Him
   as He is; He will behold us as we are: He in the perfect sameness of
   His person; we in ours. What, then, means this unbelieving Christian
   world, when it asks, Shall we then recognise each other? Will not they
   all know Him as He them, and all know each other as He knows each? Will
   He know Daniel and Isaiah, and shall they not know each other? Or shall
   the Apostles, who knew Moses and Elias upon Tabor, know them no more,
   when all are transfigured on Mount Sion? And they who knew Him after He
   rose from the dead, and knew each other as they sat in amazement before
   Him in the morning at the sea of Tiberias, shall they not know each
   other in the light of His heavenly kingdom? O dull hearts, and slow to
   believe what He has Himself spoken: "God is not the God of the
   dead,"--of nameless, obscured, obliterated spirits, of impersonal
   natures, beings robbed of their identity, spoiled of their
   consciousness--of blinded eyes, or marred aspects. The law of perfect
   recognition is inseparable from the law of perfect identity. Our
   individual consciousness must be eternal. We should not be what we are
   to ourselves, if we were not so to others. They would lose their
   identity, if they were not the same to us. The whole of God's kingdom,
   from His own incommunicable glory to the least among His elect, is
   founded upon the truth and identity of personal being. The whole
   mystery of our probation, and of the atonement, of our sanctification
   and reward, all alike rests upon the perpetuity of individual
   character. And the kingdom of God in glory is the perfection of His
   kingdom in grace, in which every several soul here tried, chastened,
   and purified, shall be there blessed, crowned, and sainted--the same in
   person, changed only to perfection.

   And more than this. The perfect restitution which shall be in the
   kingdom of the resurrection will bring back, not only perfect mutual
   recognition, but the restoration of all pure and consecrated bonds.
   Shall we be told that in the kingdom of God Jacob will no more be the
   son of Isaac, nor Isaac the son of Abraham? that Ruth shall not be to
   Naomi in bliss what she was in widowhood? Shall James and John be
   brothers no more, nor Martha and Mary sisters? or shall not St. Joseph
   be the espoused husband of the ever-virgin Mother, and the Lord her
   Divine Son? These bonds and relations are imperishable as the persons
   whom they unite. They stamp eternity and bliss upon the name of brother
   and friend, daughter and sister, husband and wife, son and mother. All
   bonds of God's first creation shall be transcribed into the new. They
   are of His creation; therefore are they pure and steadfast, and shall
   be blissful and eternal. Surely, if this divine law were not written in
   nature, it is in grace. The mystery of the Incarnation has revealed to
   us a Mother and a Son, whose bond of ineffable love is eternal. This
   alone would be enough to shew that all bonds of love, all orders and
   relations of God's institution, shall be likewise glorified. For in the
   new heaven and new earth the course of nature shall not pass away, but
   ascend upward into a supernatural perfection. As in the holy city there
   shall be neither sun nor moon, but the uncreated light, so shall all
   nature purified abide in God, and be filled with brightness; "for the
   glory of God" shall lighten it, "and the Lamb is the light thereof."
   [198]

   3. And lastly, this title pledges to us an immortal kingdom. In the
   beginning God made man, and placed him in the garden, to dress it and
   to live of its fruits. Eden was to be his own, until translated to the
   Paradise of God. When he sinned he lost his inheritance and died: earth
   and heaven turned against him. The heaven lowered with perpetual
   changes, the earth gave scanty and reluctant fruits; storms and
   scourges, toil and thorns were his portion. "In the sweat of thy face
   shalt thou eat bread," was his earthly chastisement: and with sin death
   spread on every side. All his fairest joys became transient; the most
   perfect could only endure for a time, and then pass away; eternity had
   departed with God from the soul of man. What are our sorrows and
   griefs, toils and weariness, but this, that all our life and state has
   become transient and changeful? What are poverty, hunger, sickness,
   early deaths, the breaking up of the most lasting homes, the cutting
   off of houses and lineage, the failure of hopes, the bitter
   lamentations of baffled labours, the sickening disappointment even of
   success,--what are all these but the penalty which fell upon the world
   when man sinned, wasting away his earthly happiness with a perpetual
   blight? Though he had all his heart's desire, it could not endure for
   ever; though it endured for ever, it could not satisfy his soul. But
   the resurrection has restored to us a changeless and eternal home. It
   has given back to us our inheritance in the Paradise of God, where
   there shall be a new heaven and a new earth, of which the first
   creation, even in its perfection, was only an imperfect shadow. In that
   true paradise there shall be no seasons nor vicissitudes, no sweat of
   the face nor hard toil for bread. An everlasting noontide shall be
   there; an endless spring in the newness of unfading joy, a perpetual
   autumn in the ripeness of its gifts. There shall be "the tree of life,
   bearing twelve manner of fruits;" [199] all joy and all delight for
   every capacity of man; reward for every toil, and health for every
   wound, after the manifold trial of every soul, in the Israel of God.

   O home of the weary and over-laboured, of the toiling and careworn, of
   the struggling and heavy-laden, blessed be thou! In thee shall be no
   more blasts and conflicts of the world, no more pining and want, no
   more straining and galling of hands and sinews, of heart and intellect.
   "There shall be no more curse." [200] But all shall be full, and all
   shall be at rest for ever. When all things here shall pass from us and
   we from them, this yet awaits us. "There remaineth . . . a rest for the
   people of God." When the happiness of this life burns down, who can
   rekindle it? The joy of to-day sinks with the sun, and is remembered
   with sadness to-morrow. The happiness of this world is in the past; at
   best it lingers in the present, and, even while we are speaking, is
   gone for ever. All things are fleeting and transient; to see them, we
   must look behind us. Old friends, old homes, old haunts, old faces,
   bright days, and sweet memories, all are gone. Such is the best the old
   creation has for man. But the kingdom of the resurrection is before us,
   all new, all enduring, all divine; its bliss has no future, no clouds
   upon the horizon, no fading, no instability. All that we are, by the
   power of God, we shall be, without cloying, or change, or weariness,
   for ever.

   It has been asked, "Do they keep Easter in heaven?" Not, it may be, by
   revolution of seasons, or by successions of a changeful calendar; but
   surely in a perpetual solemnity, in one ceaseless and pure act of
   heavenly joy, they keep all feasts in one. The feast of the
   Incarnation, the feast of the Resurrection, the feast of the Ascension,
   the feast of the Holy Ghost, the feast of the ever-blessed Three in the
   Beatific Vision,--these they keep always, in the fulness of adoration,
   and it may be more than this. If there be "joy in heaven over one
   sinner that repenteth;" if the angels of God's little ones do always
   behold the face of their Father; if there be perpetual sympathy and
   perpetual intercession between the Church in warfare and the Church in
   rest; if at the altar they adore with us before the eternal throne, and
   in the light of God's countenance behold all that He wills for their
   beatitude,--we may surely believe that the festivals of the Church on
   earth are no less noted than its repentance; that as they look down
   upon our sorrows, they keep harmony with our praise; that the
   fellowship of heavenly hosts, which is ever about the altar, shares
   with us in the celebration of our Easter sacrifice. Be this as it may,
   it is but a little time, and we shall all keep Easter in heaven: yet a
   little while,--and what matters a little while of sorrow or care, toil
   or weariness, hardness and solitude, repentance and striving,
   temptation and patience? After the fret and fever of a few short years
   will come the river of the water of life, "the times of refreshing,"
   and the rest of God. Let us remember that He who is the Resurrection is
   always with us; and if we be in Him, all things are ours; all shall be
   restored to us, all made new, all sinless and deathless, all our own
   again for ever.

   O eternal Life, O everlasting Peace, O Beauty uncreated, O changeless
   Love, Thou didst say, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and
   die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
   Thou hast fallen into the earth and died; Thou art "the first-fruits of
   them that slept;" and from Thee, the divine seed of the new creation,
   shall spring up the harvest of God upon the everlasting hills. Quicken
   us by Thyself, that Thou mayest now be our Life; and that at Thy coming
   we may rise in Thee.

SERMON XXI.

  LIFE EVERLASTING.

    ST. JOHN xi. 25.

   "I am the Resurrection and the Life."

   AFTER the resurrection comes life everlasting. "I am the Life." "As the
   Father hath life in Himself; so hath He given to the Son to have life
   in Himself." The Eternal Son is the Life of the world, the fountain
   from which all created life descends. Therefore He says, "He that
   believeth in Me,' that is, he who, being joined to Me by My Spirit,
   holds to Me by his heart and soul, partaking thereby of My divine life,
   as members derive life from a living head,--though he were dead, yet
   shall he live;' though soul and body were already parted--the soul
   unclothed, the body in the dust--yet shall he live.' I hold both body
   and soul unto Myself, and will knit them together again by the power of
   a life divine. He shall rise again, and live eternally. And he that
   liveth and believeth in Me shall never die;' that is, shall not die for
   ever, or shall live for ever. Death shall not be death to him. Death
   shall be changed to sleep, full of life and rest, gentle and soft, the
   body in the quiet earth, the soul in the Paradise of God. And that
   short slumber of the weary dust shall have its waking; at the
   resurrection he shall awake up into eternal life." Such is the promise.
   What does it further teach us?

   1. First, we learn that this life and the life to come are not two, but
   one and the same. Death is not the ending of one, and resurrection the
   beginning of another, but through all there runs one imperishable life.
   A river which plunges into the earth, is buried for awhile, and then
   bursts forth more mightily and in a fuller tide, is not two, but one
   continuous stream. The light of to-day and the light of to-morrow are
   not two, but one living splendour. The light of to-day is not quenched
   at sunset, and rekindled at to-morrow's sunrise; but is ever one,
   always burning broad and luminous in the sight of God and of holy
   angels. Night is but a veil between the light and us. So with life and
   death. The life of the soul is immortal, an image of God's own
   eternity. It lives on in sleep; it lives on through death; it lives
   even more abundantly, and with fuller and mightier energy. "We that are
   in this body do groan, being burdened." The flesh that is upon us is a
   clothing of mortality; and death weighs heaviest upon us while we live.
   Our true life is vast in expanse, capacity, and power; but in the body
   it is pent up, narrowed, and enthralled. A sinless body, as in the
   beginning, was a worthy instrument of its perfection; and the glorious
   body of the resurrection will be a diviner raiment: but the body of sin
   is a thraldom and a shroud upon our immortal being. When we put off our
   sinful flesh, we are delivered "from the body of this death." [201] We
   begin to live indeed. The one endless life of the soul comes forth from
   its restraint, and passes onward to a wider and more kindred world.

   2. Another great law here revealed is, that as we die, so we shall
   rise; as there is no new beginning of our life, so there is no new
   beginning of our character. The stream which buries itself cloudy and
   turbid shall rise clouded and foul. The waters that pass clear and
   bright into the earth shall issue from it bright and clear again. As we
   fall into eternity, so shall we be eternally: "He that is unjust, let
   him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still:
   and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is
   holy, let him he holy still." [202] What are these but the words of Him
   who is "the resurrection and the life," sealing every soul at death by
   a particular judgment of its existing character? We brought nothing
   into this world, and of all outward things "it is certain we can carry
   nothing out;" but there is an inward reality here acquired, which we
   shall each one carry into the eternal world. We shall all carry with us
   the very self which we have here stamped and moulded, or distorted and
   branded,--the renewed image of God, or the image of the evil one. Our
   life, from first to last, teaches us this lesson; it is one continuous
   whole, gathering up itself through all its course, and perpetuating its
   earliest features in its latest self: the child is in the boy, the boy
   is in the man; the man is himself for ever. For good or for evil, we
   see this constant law prevail. So with the resurrection of the dead.
   They who die rebellious will rise in rebellion against God; they who
   die impenitent will rise impenitent; they who die without God in the
   world will rise without God in eternity. And they too who die in
   obedience shall rise in obedience; they who die absolved shall rise
   absolved; they who die united with God in devotion and prayer shall
   rise united in love and adoration. As we die, so shall we be: our
   character running on into eternity; the bent, disposition, inclination
   of the soul, with all its powers and affections, shall endure and abide
   with us for ever; with this only change, that we shall either be better
   or worse, for good or for evil, absolute and changeless. For we may
   learn, further:

   3. That the resurrection will make each one perfect in his own several
   character. Nay, even at death it shall be unfolded into a new measure
   and fulness. Our character is our will; for what we will we are. Our
   will contains our whole intention; it sums up our spiritual nature; it
   contains what we call the tendency of our character: for the will gives
   the bias to the right or to the left; as we will, so we incline. Now
   this tendency, both for good and evil, is here imperfect; but it will
   be there fulfilled. Here it is hindered; the wicked are restrained by
   truth and grace, by laws and punishments, by fear and shame, by
   interest and the world; the good are hindered by sin and by temptation,
   by their own infirmities and faults. But there all restraints shall be
   taken away, and all aids shall be supplied. It is both an awful and
   consoling thought. The sinful soul, which has here been curbed by
   outward checks, will there break forth into an intensity stretched to
   the utmost by despair. As lights, when they pass into an atmosphere
   akin to fire, burst forth into a volume of flame, so the soul, charged
   with sin, issuing into the abode of anguish, will break forth into the
   full measure of its spiritual wickedness. The proud, angry, vindictive,
   and envious, shall each become absolute in their several kind;
   tormented, but stamped for ever by a conscious rebellion against the
   Spirit of God, and eternally rejected from His kingdom. What sinners
   are now in measure, they shall then be in its fulness. So likewise with
   the faithful: what they have striven to be, they shall be made. God's
   grace shall perfect what they had here desired. He sees what is
   contained in the intensity of a death-bed repentance. The virtues of
   the will are above the successions of time. To fulfil in a series of
   acts all the humiliation, devotion, love, self-sacrifice of a contrite
   will needs time and duration; but to conceive the perfect purpose of "a
   life hid with Christ in God" may be the act of a moment. And God reads
   the thought and the resolve of the steadfast will. So in all the life
   of the regenerate. He sees what is in the intention of each. He
   measures the sincerity of the heart, the repentance of the soul, the
   self-rebukes of the conscience, the struggles of the tempted, the
   perseverance of the weary, the toils of the heavy-laden. He knows what
   they are striving to become; what they are suffering rather than
   consent to sin; what they are giving up, that they may be His, and His
   alone. All their heart's desire, all the full meaning of their
   intention, He knows, interprets, and accepts; and when they pass out
   from the burdens and straits of this mortal life, He will fulfil their
   desire, and make them what they have striven and prayed to be. Blessed
   change to the tempted and buffeted soul, to pass into a sphere where
   sin can harass and tempt no more; where all that burdens the will and
   heart shall fall off as bands of flax in the fire, and the whole soul
   put forth its energies of love, intense and pure, by union and
   contemplation of God, in foretaste of the hour when our perfect
   consummation and bliss shall come. Let this, then, teach us two great
   truths of practice.

   1. First, how dangerous is the least sin we do. Every act confirms some
   old tendency, or develops a new one. This we may see in childhood. A
   child's whole character is sometimes turned altogether aside by one
   single act awakening an unknown tendency to sin; and every further act
   gives force and speed, and, as we say, multiplies the intensity of the
   will. This life is the childhood of eternity. We are all day long
   unfolding and fixing the character which shall be eternal. Every act of
   sin strengthens the inclination which produced it, and reacts upon us,
   inflaming and aggravating the evil disposition of the soul. Acts are
   the most consummate forms of evil; they express the whole force of the
   sin which rules us, and of our spiritual nature, which conceives and
   perfects them. Acts are to the soul what fruits are to a tree,--the
   full and complete effort of its nature, the production of its entire
   life and kind. They concentrate our intention, will, thought, desire,
   and strength; and therefore return with the heaviest recoil upon
   ourselves, making us more prone to the same sins again, and less
   willing to resist.

   Only less than acts are words of sin; for they also express our whole
   inward being. And often it is no want of sinful inclination, but only
   of common courage, which makes men speak what they dare not do. In this
   case it is hard to say whether sinful words be not in one way even more
   corrupting than sinful acts; for acts sometimes bring sharp
   chastisements, while words escape with an impunity of shame. By the
   tongue men may blacken their whole inmost soul; for verily it "setteth
   on fire the course of nature; and itself is set on fire of hell." [203]

   In like manner, sins of thought fix the whole character and dye of the
   heart, whether they be thoughts of gross or spiritual wickedness; for
   not only the baser, but the more refined sins are fatally corrupting.
   Of the seven sins commonly called deadly, the greater number are
   spiritual sins, and, as such, peculiarly Satanic. Thoughts of pride,
   envy, scorn, jealousy, and the like, steep and discolour, wither and
   scorch the soul; and such as it becomes by its inward actings, such,
   except by the grace of God converted, it must die, and such it must
   rise again, and be made perfect in evil for ever.

   2. The other truth is, how precious is every means of grace. The
   patriarch saw in vision a ladder reaching from earth to heaven, and at
   the head of it the Presence of the Lord. This mystical ascent of many
   steps is, as it were, a parable of the way which leads to a holy
   resurrection. Every means of grace is a step in that heavenly stair.

   Our baptism is a sacrament of the resurrection. In it we died unto sin,
   were buried with Christ, and with Him rose again. "Buried with Him,"
   St. Paul says, "by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised
   from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk
   in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the
   likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His
   resurrection." [204] By the gift of our regeneration we were united to
   the mystical body of Christ; we were made members of a Head already
   risen from the dead; we were joined to Him who is "the Resurrection and
   the Life." This is the first step in the way; and every act and grace
   in our regenerate life is a further step towards perfect newness of
   soul and body. Our Lord Himself, speaking of the resurrection, calls it
   "the regeneration;" so that baptism is the resurrection begun in us,
   and the resurrection is baptism made perfect. The whole life of the
   Church is a continuous regeneration, or a perpetual resurrection: dead
   souls ever rising, earthly bodies ever changing from mortality to our
   kindred earth, to be raised again in the perfect glory of everlasting
   life.

   What a depth and worth does this put into all the means and acts of a
   life of faith; into our prayers, self-examination, and confessions;
   into all our works of repentance, love, and mercy; but above all, into
   the blessed sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ. He has declared
   to us, "This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may
   eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread, which came down from
   heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the
   bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of
   the world. . . . . Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the
   flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.
   Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I
   will raise him up at the last day." [205] "As the living Father hath
   sent Me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth Me, even he shall
   live by Me. This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
   fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall
   live for ever." [206] Therefore this blessed sacrament has been
   honoured from the beginning, as the medicine which expels the power of
   death, and the food of immortality.

   Let this, then, be our first aim in life, that we may attain unto the
   resurrection of the holy dead. Let us learn to count all things "but
   loss, that we may win Christ," and at that day "be found in Him;" "that
   we may know Him, and the power of His resurrection;" working in us with
   a new and vivid life, awakening our whole soul, to live by Him, to Him,
   and in Him, "if by any means we may attain unto the resurrection of the
   dead."

   "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; on
   him the second death hath no power." Whatsoever be this mystery of a
   first fruits from among the dead at Christ's coming, there is a first
   resurrection which must now pass on all who would partake of it
   hereafter; a rising now from the death of sin to a life in God's spirit
   and presence. Let this be our great work from the present hour until
   the resurrection of the dead. For what else will suffice, what else
   endure, when all things below God shall pass away? What, then, is life
   for a while, even the saddest, loneliest, sharpest? what are the cares
   and forebodings, the sorrows and tears, the pains and sicknesses, the
   tears and sighs of repentance, the fears and shrinkings as death comes
   near? Where shall all these be when "the trumpet shall sound, and the
   dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed?" O where
   then will be the care-worn and mourners, the sick and the penitent,
   when all shall be full of heavenly joy, and clothed in heavenly array;
   when loved faces shall be no more clouded or death-struck, but blissful
   and radiant with eternal beauty? Believest thou this? and yet weepest
   thou? There shall be no wounds then in flesh or spirit, no pining and
   wasting of body, but eternal health; no griefs of penitent souls, but
   the peace of a perfect absolution. Believest thou this? O day of
   miracles! O miracle of power and love divine! we shall rise again in
   all personal perfection, as if sin had never entered, nor death ever
   set foot upon the earth; we shall be gathered unto Him who is our life,
   with all our loved ones in perfect mutual knowledge, and all bonds made
   new. We shall be a new creation, and yet still the old; new in all the
   perfectness of bliss, old in all the truth of our being. He hath
   renewed, not another creation, but our own; He hath created again, not
   another race in our likeness, but our very selves. He partook of our
   very substance, that He might raise us up each one in the newness of
   His Divine humanity.

   And there shall we see Him face to face; we shall fall down and worship
   with the full flow of love made perfect, with the direct energy of a
   heart made like His own. We shall not only behold Him, but have power
   both to love and to adore; our whole spiritual being spotless as the
   angels of God; all our intelligence filled with uncreated light; all
   our affections kindled with eternal love; all our will steadfast in a
   changeless and blissful union with His own. To behold Him unveiled, and
   to have power to love Him; to be with Him in manifest presence, and to
   be like Him in the soul of our inmost life,--this shall be our
   eternity; this is everlasting Life.

SERMON XXII.

  THE INTUITION OF FAITH.

    2 COR. iii. 18.

   "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
   are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the
   Spirit of the Lord."

   ST. PAUL here contrasts the revelation given by God through Moses, with
   the revelation given by the Word made flesh. The first was given to one
   alone; Moses alone saw the skirts of the divine glory, and spoke with
   God in the mount: we all behold His glory, and have access through the
   Son to the Father. Moses, after speaking with God, had need to put a
   veil upon his face, for the people could not bear even the reflected
   brightness of God's Presence: St. Paul says, "We all with open face"
   behold it. The Word made flesh has both revealed to us the glory of the
   Lord, and has given to us the power to look upon it: "God was manifest
   in the flesh." He is "the brightness of His glory, and the express
   image of His Person;" [207] "the image of the invisible God:" [208] He
   "dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory." [209] But this revelation
   upon earth was transient; it had passed away when St. Paul wrote these
   words. Yet though past, it was not withdrawn: though hidden, it was yet
   revealed. "The glory of the Lord," in Christ, is an eternal revelation,
   open still to us: "We all with open face" behold it now.

   By faith we stand before the throne, out of which go forth "lightnings
   and thunderings and voices;" by faith we dwell continually in the
   presence of the Divine Majesty. The Son hath returned unto the Father,
   and His visible presence is no more seen. But "God, who commanded the
   light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the
   light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
   Christ." [210]

   Let us first see what is this great sight, "the glory of the Lord." It
   is fourfold. First, there is the glory of His Godhead--eternal,
   infinite, invisible, all-wise, all-mighty, love, wisdom, and power; the
   glory of the Divine Personality, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; "the
   Father made of none, neither created nor begotten; the Son of the
   Father alone, not made, nor created, but begotten; the Holy Ghost of
   the Father and of the Son, neither made nor created, nor begotten, but
   proceeding." This is the essential glory of God, inhabiting eternity,
   "the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
   who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can
   approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour
   and power everlasting. Amen." [211]

   And in this glory, descending from the uncreated to the manifestation
   of Himself, is the glory of the Word made flesh. "God of the substance
   of the Father, begotten before the world, and man of the substance of
   His Mother, born in the world; perfect God, and perfect man:" two
   natures in one Person, never to be divided; who having "by Himself
   purged our sins," hath sat down, with the stigmas of His passion, upon,
   the throne of glory, of whose "kingdom there shall be no end." [212]

   This is the glory of God, before which the spirits of love and the
   spirits of knowledge cry "Holy" evermore, which angels worship, and the
   whole heavenly court adores; the mystery of the eternal Three, one God,
   blessed for ever, revealed in the Incarnate Son.

   But around this beatific vision, and from this Incarnate Presence
   descending, is the glory of the kingdom of God, the throne and
   government of the Incarnate Son, to whom, when He laid "the government
   upon His shoulder," [213] the Father said, "Thy throne, O God, is for
   ever and ever." [214] "Behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat
   on the throne. And He that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a
   sardine stone: . . . and round about the throne were four and twenty
   seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed
   in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. . . . .
   And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are
   the seven Spirits of God. And all the angels stood round about the
   throne, and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb,
   having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which
   are the prayers of the saints." [215] "And I saw under the altar the
   souls of them that were slain for the testimony which they held: and
   they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true,
   dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell in the
   earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was
   said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season." "And
   another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and
   there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the
   prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the
   throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of
   the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand." [216]

   What is this vision which was unfolded to the sight of St. John in
   Patmos, but the glory of the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ? To the
   prophet it was an object of vision; to us an object of faith. He beheld
   it as it is revealed to the orders of saints and angels in heaven; and
   he saw the angelic ministries of power and grace, by which the elect of
   God are sealed and gathered into His unseen rest. What is this but the
   kingdom in which apostles, prophets, martyrs, and all saints, reign
   with Christ--the invisible head and source of the spiritual kingdom,
   both in heaven and earth, ever multiplying and expanding its fulness,
   as from age to age it gathers in the generations of the faithful from
   our lower world?

   And what is the visible Church militant on earth but the outskirts and
   lower sphere of this ever-enlarging mystery of grace, here in its faint
   beginnings, sinful and mortal, there sinless and redeemed from death?
   This, too, is the glory of the Lord.

   He that sitteth upon the throne "holdeth the seven stars in His right
   hand, and walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks." [217]
   He who filleth all in all, visible in heaven, as touching His manhood,
   is present, though unseen on earth, in the undivided fulness of His
   incarnate personality. The Lord Jesus Christ reigns by the direct
   exercise of His divine government throughout heaven and earth. He has
   knit together "the services of angels and men in a wonderful order,"
   and out of earthly elements created sacraments of grace. The Church in
   heaven and earth is one: the twofold manifestation of His glory on
   either side the veil. The invisible and blessed part of the Church
   which has gone before us with the sign of faith, and rests in the sleep
   of peace, is an object of faith, because wholly withdrawn from sight;
   but the Church on earth is as yet partly an object of sense. We see it
   and converse with it, behold its worship, kneel at its altars, touch
   its sacraments, handle its mysteries. And yet it is not an object of
   sense only, but also of faith. For what is its visible order but the
   manifestation of the presence of the Holy Ghost? What are the gifts of
   regeneration, the invisible operation of visible sacraments, the
   spiritual illumination and guidance of the Church, the power of prayer,
   the communion of saints, the mutual love and intercession of all
   members of Christ's body, the pledges of the resurrection,--what are
   all these but realities issuing from the incarnation of the Son, laws
   of His mediatorial kingdom, descending from on high into "all places of
   His dominion," manifold miracles issuing from the one great miracle of
   His perpetual presence, against which the gates of hell shall not
   prevail?

   And, lastly, what are all these degrees of glory but revelations of the
   moral glory of the Lord; that is, of the love of God and of His Son
   Jesus Christ? This is the central light, of which all other glory is
   the brightness and the radiance. This is the image of God as seen of
   angels, revealed in the face of Jesus Christ; into the likeness of
   which every faithful soul is changed by the Spirit of the Lord. The
   divine character of God, and the human character of the incarnate Son;
   the love and sanctity, the humility and meekness of the Son of Mary,
   God and Man in one person, our Redeemer and our example. He created us
   by His power, and now, through faith, changes us by His Spirit, making
   us like unto Himself, and will "change also even the body of our
   humiliation, that it may be like unto the body of His glory, by the
   mighty working whereby He is able to subdue all things unto Himself."

   This, then, is the glory of the eternal God, the blessed Three, the
   holy One, the glory of the Son of Man, the glory of His kingdom and His
   character, both in heaven and earth. And all these together make up but
   one divine and spiritual reality, which through our baptismal creed is
   as truly proposed to our faith as the world we see is presented to our
   sight.

   Now St. Paul says that we, as members of Christ, behold all this
   manifold glory "as in a glass," as if it were a direct object of
   vision, and that by beholding it we are changed. It has an assimilating
   power; and that which makes us capable of its transforming influence is
   our beholding it "with open face." What, then, is this power of vision,
   this spiritual sight, by which the unseen is visible; in one word, what
   is faith? It is the power which the Son of God has given us to behold
   the glory of the Lord.

   But we are asked, What is this power, this faith, which is given to us?

   The controversies of these later ages have committed two evils: they
   have dethroned the object of faith, and have degraded faith itself.
   Faith is something more divine than disputants believe. Some will have
   it to be a speculative assent to truths revealed; and some, to correct
   them, will have it to be a principle of moral action; and others, to
   set both sides right, join together these two definitions in one, and
   tell us that faith is a principle of moral action springing out of a
   speculative assent to truths revealed. As if faith were something
   partial and fragmentary, the action of half our being; an effect
   without a cause, or with a cause simply human, and within the natural
   endowments of the human intelligence. Surely all these alike, if not
   all equally, come short of truth. We might as well say that sight is a
   belief of things seen, or that sight is action arising out of a belief
   in what we see. What are these but the effects of sight demanding and
   pointing to a cause? They are the consequences of sight, not sight
   itself. So action and assent spring from faith; but what is that cause
   or power which is before both the assent and action of faith? What but
   faith itself? And what is it? Faith is a spiritual consciousness of the
   world unseen, infused into us, in our regeneration, by the supernatural
   gift of God. "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
   God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
   because they are spiritually discerned." [218] He needs a divine power
   of intuition implanted in the soul and terminating on the world unseen,
   as sight is a natural faculty of perception terminating on the world we
   see. And faith is that power of spiritual perception analogous to
   sense, that is, to sight, hearing, and feeling; and also to affection,
   that is, to love, fear, and desire. It is as wide as the whole soul of
   man, uniting it in one continuous act. As our waking sense checks our
   irregular thoughts, and subjects us to the conditions of the world we
   see; so faith brings the whole spiritual nature of man under the
   dominion and laws of the unseen kingdom of God. This supernatural gift
   was infused into us as a habit by the Spirit of God; but in its acting
   it depends upon our will.

   Now to make this somewhat clearer, let us take it in order.

   We have by nature two powers by which we attain to knowledge, and two
   objects upon which these powers terminate. Revelation and regeneration
   have superadded a third object and power, which embrace and perfect the
   other two.

   By nature we apprehend this sensible creation by sense. Sensations are
   the beginning of knowledge, as to this visible world. And sensations
   are bounded by the limits of sense. They cannot reach beyond the
   horizon of sight, hearing, feeling, taste, and the like.

   But we have a higher power directed to a higher object. We have
   intellect, which terminates upon the intellectual world. And by
   intellect we interpret our sensations; we perceive such objects as
   cause, relation, proportion, substance, and the like. Intellect is a
   higher power than sense, and corrects its errors. Phenomena are the
   objects of sense; ideas are the objects of the intellect. The ideal
   world is a reality which informs the world of sense. To the phenomena
   of creation intellect adds at once the idea of God, not so much by
   inference as by consciousness, that is, by a concurrent perception.

   But revelation has proposed to us another and higher object--a world of
   spiritual realities; and regeneration has infused into us a power to
   apprehend it. Sense gives us the perception of the visible world;
   intellect its interpretation, namely, the power and perfection of God;
   faith, the mystery of the Godhead. Intellect corrects and exalts sense;
   faith corrects and exalts both. To take an example. Sense beheld in
   Jesus of Nazareth a man; intellect, a man endowed with supernatural
   powers; faith, the Word made flesh. The judgments of sense and of the
   intellect were true, but inadequate: faith included and corrected both,
   exalting them to a spiritual intuition. Take another example. The
   blessed Sacrament to sense is bread and wine; to intellect a symbol; to
   faith the Body and Blood of Christ. Or, once more, to sense the visible
   Church is a society of men; to intellect an organised and historical
   kingdom; to faith it is the heavenly court on earth, the beginning of
   the new creation of God.

   The consciousness of spiritual life unites itself with the presence of
   God, and in Him is united to the proper objects of faith, that is, to
   things unseen. And therefore faith has been defined as the perfection
   of the will and of the intellect--of the will as it sanctifies, of the
   intellect as it illuminates, of both at once as it issues in its
   congenial fruits. It is one all-penetrating, manifold, wakeful,
   energetic power, like the principle of life itself, universal,
   quickening, and prolific. Acting towards God, it issues in trust, love,
   prayer, contemplation, worship; towards man, in charity, gentleness,
   self-denial; upon ourselves, in abasement, discipline, and penance.

   When it draws motives of action from the unseen, it is "the victory
   which overcometh the world;" when it dwells with fixed and confiding
   desire upon the kingdom of God, it is "the substance of things hoped
   for, the evidence of things not seen;" when it conforms our will to the
   will of God, it is the transforming intuition which changes us "into
   the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord." It
   works in all the workings of our nature, taking up all our natural
   powers, restoring to each its original perfection, uniting them in
   conscious harmony with God.

   But this infused gift of faith, like all gifts of God, is subject to
   the will in man. It is the matter of our highest probation. It may he
   used or abused, matured or neglected, made perfect or perverted. It may
   be quenched, until it dies down into a mere consciousness of spiritual
   agony; or it may be sustained by its proper acts and energies upon the
   objects of faith, upon God, and the mysteries of His kingdom, the Word
   made flesh, the heavenly court, the real presence of Christ on earth,
   the perpetual mystery of Pentecost, the grace of sacraments, and the
   effusion of the Spirit of God.

   If, then, our salvation depends upon beholding this glory of the Lord,
   and if the power to behold it be a gift entrusted to us by God,
   depending for its exercise and for its very existence on our will, then
   how may it be unfolded and matured?

   First, by purifying the conscience. The gift of this spiritual
   consciousness is implanted in us by baptism; but the sin which still
   dwells in us perpetually sends up exhalations of its sensuality. As
   these prevail, men live by sense, and "walk after the flesh;" and in
   that proportion the regenerate consciousness is obstructed and
   stupified. It becomes deadened and inactive. This is what we call
   unbelief. Not that Christians do not believe in God and Christ and
   judgment to come; but that they are insensible: what they believe has
   no power to alarm or to persuade them.

   They so develop the consciousness of self and sin, of the flesh and of
   the world, that they become habitually unconscious and insensible
   towards the world unseen. I do not mean absolutely unconscious, for
   none except the imbruted actually lose consciousness of God and
   judgment. The sinful retain a consciousness which is their scourge and
   torment; the remembrance of a world beyond the grave, in which every
   holy power is arrayed against them, is their anguish. They cannot shake
   it off. Day and night it haunts and clings to them. It holds them with
   a frightful tenacity; for St. James says, "The devils believe, and
   tremble." [219] A regenerate soul, in rebellion against the spiritual
   light within, has a power of wickedness greater than that of mere
   humanity. This accounts for the intense malignity of regenerate
   sinners. They have a twofold capacity of evil, both of the flesh and of
   the spirit. And they have a twofold measure of remorse. The spiritual
   consciousness is keen and vivid in its sense of fear and pain; it is
   the gnawing of "the worm that dieth not." It wraps them about as the
   flame which never shall be quenched.

   We can see at once the effect of gross sins in destroying this gift of
   sanctifying and enlightening consciousness. But we often fail to purify
   our conscience from the infections of more refined evils; and yet these
   are almost equally destructive to the intuition of faith. We may see
   this in what we call worldly men. The action of the world deadens the
   keenness of their spiritual perceptions; the habit of fixing attention
   on objects of sense and of intellect has a tendency to draw the mind
   from the objects of spiritual contemplation. The external eye is busier
   than the internal, and draws all thoughts after it. We all know that
   familiarity with the outward world makes men unimaginative, dry, and
   matter-of-fact; they become bounded by sense, and by the round of daily
   experience and events; they live in habitual forgetfulness of the
   unseen.

   We see this in ambitious men. Forecasting and keen-sighted as they are
   for the doubles and changes of political life, they seem wanting in the
   very faculty of realising the kingdom of God. This world dazzles and
   intoxicates them; they become excited in their career, and concentrated
   in their aim. Every thing bends to it; all is lost in it; all beyond it
   is nothing to them. The least event, chance, or probability, will
   summon up all their power, and launch them in long and obstinate
   struggles. But the Word of God, which smites as a hammer, and the
   certainty of judgment soon to come, fail to move them. The same is true
   of all intense application of mind, as in professions, science,
   literature, or business; the over-wrought and weary mind loses its
   inwardness, and becomes passive and external. It forfeits also its
   sensitiveness, and comes at last to perceive nothing but that which
   powerfully excites it. This is specially true of the love of money;
   both in getting and hoarding, its rust passes into the soul. The same
   is true also of a life of pleasure; nothing more deadens and relaxes
   the fibre of the mind, and wears out its perceptions. The languid and
   exhausted soul grows too heavy to dwell on the invisible. The noise,
   hurry, and perpetual excitement of self-indulgence wastes away the
   deeper and finer senses; then a refined selfishness turns all the
   powers of the mind to minister to itself. It becomes absorbed in the
   one thought of self-pleasing and self-worship. Every thing high and
   true is too severe and real for its softened and shrinking touch. No
   unbelief is nearer to practical atheism than the unconsciousness of a
   frivolous and worldly heart.

   It is not only unlawful things, but also lawful things in unlawful
   measures, which dull the consciousness of things eternal. A life of
   God's best earthly gifts may so overgrow the soul as to make it dim and
   insensible. Friends, possessions, happiness, fill up the heart,
   anticipate every wish, clog every desire, and bind the soul by fond and
   tenacious affections to home, its gifts and joys. There is no craving
   for another state, when this is so full of pleasures. Such men have no
   desire to wind up this daily happiness and to depart. Life has too many
   pledges; eternity is too severe. These things, too, cloud the inward
   vision, and draw a veil over the objects of faith.

   This must be purged away, if we would waken up our spiritual
   consciousness of God and the kingdom of His grace.

   A single cloud, even a film of conscious sin, dulls the spiritual
   sense. It closes its sight for fear, and shrinks from the realities
   which condemn it as it beholds them. Then darkness thickens over the
   soul, and hangs as a veil between it and the presence of God: "If thine
   eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness." [220]

   A clear intention is the very life of the consciousness of God and of
   His kingdom. And this clear intention of the heart is to be attained
   only by habitual self-examination and penitent confession, made under
   the eyes in which the heavens are unclean.

   This is the first and absolute condition to beholding "the glory of the
   Lord."

   2. The next is, a habitual use of spiritual exercises, such as
   meditation and prayer, whether mental or in words, and the like. By
   spiritual exercise is meant specially, an exercise of the will
   awakening the consciousness of our spiritual life. Reading and thought
   are almost passive states, so far as concerns the will. Emotions and
   desires we cannot control; but the wall is our very self summed up in a
   continual energy or act. Prayer is chiefly an act of the will. Both
   desires and thoughts often flag and wander, while the will is steadfast
   in prayer. It is by such an exercise of the will that the intuitions of
   faith, and the actings of faith, are awakened and matured; for faith,
   as we have seen, is a moral habit, having its root in the will. If we
   will, we can realise spiritual things; or, if we will not, all is
   impalpable and dark. Truth is truth to us only when we perceive it. The
   unseen world is a reality to us only when we are conscious of it. The
   whole Catholic faith, the worship of the Church, the discipline of
   spiritual life through devotions and sacraments, has no existence for
   us, until we have united our spiritual consciousness with them by acts
   of faith and of the will. Catholic tradition can only propose these
   things from without; pastors can only provoke or stir us to personal
   acts of faith.

   There is one severe and absolute condition to our knowledge of eternal
   realities; we must know them by our own experience and intuition: "God
   is a spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and
   in truth." [221] Therefore so few worship Him indeed. There are many
   kinds of religious character, but only one has the true faith which
   beholds "with open face." Some Christians are conscientiously formal;
   some faultless in their intellectual views of truth; some full of
   devout emotions and sensations: but all these may alike fall short of
   the calm, severe, penetrating, and spiritual insight of faith.

   It is not difficult to find the reason of this. Religion has touched
   this or that part of their nature,--the conscience, the intellect, the
   emotions,--but has passed lightly over the will. They have exercised
   the conscience, intellect, and emotions, but have left the will
   undisciplined and immature. Therefore they complain of weariness,
   coldness, and weakness. The objects of faith are faint, and wield
   little power over them, because the inward consciousness is languid and
   dim. This is the reason why their prayers are so broken and lukewarm.
   They are the occasional conditions of their heart, not the occasional
   utterances of an habitual intention.

   Without mental prayer and the exercise of the will, all devotions fall
   into a mechanical recitation. The mere intellectual habit of dwelling
   on unseen realities seems altogether wanting in many minds. They find
   it no hard task to listen, or to read, or to pass ideas in rapid
   succession across the eye of their mind; but to dwell steadfastly on
   any one thought, such as sin, judgment, the love of God, the passion of
   our Lord, and to hold it fast by repeated meditation and sustained
   reflection till it has awakened a response in their personal
   consciousness, seems to many people intellectually impossible. Their
   mind appears unable to poise itself so long upon a solitary thought. As
   soon as it begins, it wavers and falls into distraction. They are
   variable and restless, passing and repassing from truth to truth
   without realising any; and what we do not realise is as powerless as a
   shadow.

   But if the unseen world have no transforming influence over us, this
   world will surely and deeply conform us to itself. All things around
   play upon us: all the day long its incessant and importunate activity
   warps us into its own mould and inclination. We become sensual, or
   intellectual, or formal; familiar with truth, but without feeling; full
   of sensations and emotions without stability, of aspirations without
   attainment, of intentions without perseverance. And why? Because the
   object of faith finds no intuition or response in our consciousness or
   in our will.

   Let us, then, make it part of our daily life to exercise ourselves in
   acts of faith, hope, and love; that is, to dwell on these, and on the
   motives from which they spring, till our spiritual life has taken their
   form and direction. Every day we should endeavour to renew the decaying
   perceptions of our hearts, by recalling the realities of our baptismal
   creed, and making them a part of our inward life by deliberate acts of
   will. And all the day long our endeavour, and at least our habitual
   intention, ought to be to realise the presence of God, and of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, in the midst of His heavenly court, until we live before
   Him with a sustained consciousness of His nearness, that He is our
   Life, and that we dwell in Him and He in us, ever changing us "into the
   same image from glory to glory" by the power of His Spirit.

   3. And the last and highest means of perfecting the gift of grace is,
   to exercise it habitually upon the real presence of our blessed Lord in
   the Sacrament of His Body and of His Blood. For this very end it was
   ordained, that when He should withdraw His visible presence, He might
   still abide with us unseen; that when He ceased to be an object of
   sight, He might become an object of faith; and that the spiritual
   consciousness of our hearts should there for ever meet with the reality
   of His presence. The holy Eucharist is the point of union between what
   is subjective and what is objective in our life of faith. It is in
   itself an object both of sight and of faith. In the sphere of sense it
   is unchanged; and of all matters subject to its cognisance, sense is an
   ultimate and absolute judge. But the realities of the unseen world are
   not subject to sense; they are objects of faith alone. And that holy
   mystery is what it is made by the consecration of the Son of God. It
   represents to us His Incarnation, Sacrifice, and Death. It presents to
   us the realities of His Body and Blood. It applies them to us by His
   Divine power, and incorporates us with Himself. As an object of faith,
   it is made what it is called by consecration; to us it is what it
   becomes, whether unto life or death, by our faith: we can neither make
   nor unmake its objective reality. We have power only over our manner of
   receiving it. It stands as the visible witness of the world unseen: a
   supernatural object in the midst of this natural order; "the glory of
   the Lord" "as in a glass," yet beheld "with open face."

   In this divine mystery the order of the new creation of God is visibly
   set forth. What the Church does on earth, our only and true High Priest
   does in Heaven. The blessed Eucharist is the earthly counterpart of the
   altar, seen in the apocalyptic vision. We offer the Lamb of God in a
   mystery. It lies slain upon mount Sion. The great oblation of the cross
   is a perpetual propitiation, ever fresh and all-prevailing before God.
   In the holy Sacrament it is exhibited and applied. The whole work of
   redemption is there visibly proposed to our faith. The incarnation of
   the Eternal Word: the love of the Son of God: His quickening death: His
   body wounded, His blood shed for the life of the world: our
   incorporation in His mystical body: His true and substantial union with
   us: our participation of His divine nature: our perpetual sustenance by
   His presence, who is the Resurrection and the Life,--all these compass
   us about; we are in their presence and in contact with them. This is
   the closest access to which we are now admitted with the Presence of
   Christ. Since our regeneration, no other mystery so intimately grafts
   our life upon the eternal world. It is the food of the new creation;
   the bread of angels; the power of the world to come. To those who
   believe in no series of supernatural facts linking the mystery of our
   Lord's incarnation with the resurrection of the saints, holy sacraments
   are mere solemnities, expressive rites, or, as some in secret feel,
   tedious and unmeaning ceremonies. No wonder that natural men lift the
   heel against the visible sign of an invisible presence, and deride the
   mystery of a divine incarnation. It is a pride akin to that by which it
   is believed that angels fell, They would not adore the divine manhood:
   the faithless will not believe it. To such high hearts our altars must
   be an empty ritual. To us the blessed Sacrament is substance and life.
   It reveals to us the glory of redeeming love: "Herein is love; not that
   we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the
   propitiation for our sins." Herein is pity, that the Son gave Himself
   to be born and die; that He came down to us in our flesh; that He comes
   down to us in His compassion, veiled in a mystery. All His tenderness,
   patience, pardon, are there. The fulness of His divine love and of His
   human sympathy draw us to His feet.

   Be often, then, before the altar. Let holy communion be, if it may,
   your daily bread--the holy Sacrament your daily meditation. Look
   through the transparent forms which for a while hide Him from your
   sight. Muse upon His presence, His nearness, His indwelling. Exercise
   your faith, and awaken the conscious affections of your heart towards
   Him, humbling Himself to you within the sphere of your infirmity, that
   He may exalt you to the kingdom of His glory. Yet a little while, and
   all veils which hang between heaven and earth shall be taken away, and
   you shall behold the King in His beauty, not as now "in a glass
   darkly," but "then face to face," when all desires are fulfilled, and
   all "the pure in heart shall see God."

Index of Latin Words and Phrases

     * à priori: [320]1 [321]2
     * Erat ibi tunica, dicit Evangelista, desuper texta. Ergo de coelo,
       ergo a Patre, ergo a Spiritu Sancto. Quae est ista tunica, nisi
       caritas, quam nemo potest dividere? Quae est ista tunica, nisi
       unitas? In ipsam sors mittitur, nemo illam dividit. Sacramenta sibi
       haeretici dividere potuerunt, caritatem non diviserunt. Et quia
       dividere non potuerunt, recesserunt: illa autem manet integra.:
       [322]1
     * Non enim Christus in capite et non in corpore, sed Christus totus
       in capite et in corpore.: [323]1
     * Non solo sacramento sed re ipsa manducaverunt corpus Christi, in
       ipso ejus corpore: [324]1
     * Quae est civitas Dei, nisi sancta Ecclesia? Homines enim amantes se
       invicem, et amantes Deum suum, qui in illis habitat, faciunt
       civitatem Deo. Quia lege quadam civitas continetur, lex ipsa eorum,
       caritas est, et ipsa caritas, Deus est.: [325]1
