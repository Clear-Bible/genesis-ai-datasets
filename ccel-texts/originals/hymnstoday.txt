FOREWORD

   These verses are simple expressions of common Christian feelings and
   desires in this present time,--hymns of today that may be sung together
   by people who know the thought of the age, and are not afraid that any
   truth of science will destroy religion, or any revolution on earth
   overthrow the kingdom of heaven. Therefore these are hymns of trust and
   joy and hope.

   In the writing, each of them has followed a familiar air, heard in the
   mind; and the names of these tunes are given. But if some one with the
   gift of melody should compose new and better music for the hymns, the
   author would be glad and grateful. As they stand, they are at the
   service of all who ask and receive the permission of the publishers to
   use them.

   Henry Van Dyke.

I
VOYAGERS

   "The sea is his, and he made it."--Ps. XCV:5.

   8.6.8.6.4.4.4.4

   [1]Meiringen.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   O Maker of the Mighty Deep

   Whereon our vessels fare,

   Above our life's adventure keep

   Thy faithful watch and care.

   In Thee we trust, whate'er befall;

   Thy sea is great, our boats are small.


   We know not where the secret tides

   Will help us or delay,

   Nor where the lurking tempest hides,

   Nor where the fogs are gray.

   We trust in Thee, whate'er befall;

   Thy sea is great, our boats are small.


   When outward bound we boldly sail

   And leave the friendly shore,

   Let not our heart of courage fail

   Until the voyage is o'er.

   We trust in Thee, whate'er befall;

   Thy sea is great, our boats are small.


   When homeward bound we gladly turn,

   O bring us safely there,

   Where harbor-lights of friendship burn

   And peace is in the air.

   We trust in Thee, whate'er befall;

   Thy sea is great, our boats are small.


   Beyond the circle of the sea,

   When voyaging is past,

   We seek our final port in Thee;

   O bring us home at last.

   In Thee we trust, whate'er befall;

   Thy sea is great, our boats are small.

II
THE BURNING BUSH

   "I will now turn aside and see this great sight."--Exod. III:3.

   L. M.

   [2]Canonbury.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   Thy wisdom and Thy might appear,

   Eternal God, through every year;

   From day to day, from hour to hour,

   Thy works reveal self-ordered power.


   We worship Thee whose will hath laid

   Thy sovereign rule on all things made;

   The faithful stars, the fruitful earth,

   Obey Thy laws that gave them birth.


   Yet Thou canst make a marvel shine

   Amid these mighty laws of Thine.

   As when Thy servant Moses came

   And saw the bush with Thee aflame.


   We turn aside and tread the ways

   That lead through wonder up to praise;

   Wherever Thou by man art found

   The homely earth is holy ground.


   If Thou hast formed us out of dust

   Through ages long,--in Thee we trust;

   O grant us in our souls to see

   The living flame that comes from Thee.

III
CHILDREN IN THE MARKET-PLACE

   "They are like children in the market-place."--Luke VII:32.

   C. M. D.

   [3]St. Leonard.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   Like children in the market-place

   Who weary of their play,

   We turn from folly's idle race

   And come to Thee today.

   O Jesus, teller of the tale

   That never will grow old,

   Thy words of living truth prevail

   Our listening hearts to hold.


   Tell us of Father-love that speaks

   Peace to the wandering child;

   Of valiant Shepherd-love that seeks

   The lost sheep in the wild;

   Of deep Redeemer-love that knows

   What sins we need forgiven,

   And on the Magdalen bestows

   The purest joy of Heaven.


   Tell us of faith that's like a sword,

   And hope that's like a star;

   How great the patient soul's reward,

   How blest the loyal are.

   Tell us of courage like a wall

   No storm can batter down;

   Tell us of men who venture all

   For Thee, and win a crown.


   Tell us that life is not a game,

   But real and brave and true;

   A journey with a glorious aim,

   A quest to carry through.

   Tell us that though our wills are weak

   And though we children be,

   The everlasting good we seek

   We can attain through Thee.

IV
JESUS RETURN

   "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."--St. John
   XIV:18.

   8.6.8.8.6

   [4]Elton.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   Return, dear Lord, to those who look

   With eager eyes that yearn

   For Thee among the garden flowers;

   After the dark and lonely hours,

   As morning light return.


   Return to those who wander far,

   With lamps that dimly burn,

   Along the troubled road of thought,

   Where doubt and conflict come unsought,--

   With inward joy return.


   Return to those on whom the yoke

   Of life is hard and stern;

   Renew the hope within their breast,

   Draw them to Thee and give them rest;

   O Friend of Man, return.


   Return to this war-weary world,

   And help us all to learn

   Thy secret of victorious life,

   The love that triumphs over strife,--

   O prince of Peace, return.


   Jesus, we ask not now that day

   When all men shall discern

   Thy coming with the angelic host;

   Today, to all who need Thee most,

   In silent ways, return!
     __________________________________________________________________

V
ONE IN CHRIST

   "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold."--St. John X:16.

   7.6.8.6.D.

   [5]Alford.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   No form of human framing,

   No bond of outward might,

   Can bind Thy Church together, Lord,

   And all her flocks unite;

   But, Jesus, Thou hast told us

   How unity must be:

   Thou art with God the Father one,

   And we are one in Thee.


   The mind that is in Jesus

   Will guide us into truth,

   The humble, open, joyful mind

   Of ever-learning youth;

   The heart that is in Jesus

   Will lead us out of strife,

   The giving and forgiving heart

   That follows love in life.


   Wherever men adore Thee,

   Our souls with them would kneel;

   Wherever men implore Thy help,

   Their trouble we would feel;

   And where men do Thy service,

   Though knowing not Thy sign,

   Our hand is with them in good work,

   For they are also Thine.


   Forgive us, Lord, the folly

   That quarrels with Thy friends,

   And draw us nearer to Thy heart

   Where every discord ends;

   Thou art the crown of manhood,

   And Thou of God the Son;

   O Master of our many lives,

   In Thee our life is one.

VI
FOUNDATIONS

   "Those things which cannot be shaken"--Heb. XII:28.

   8.7.8.7.4.4.7.

   [6]Regent Square.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   Now again the world is shaken,

   Tempests break on sea and shore;

   Earth with ruin overtaken,

   Trembles while the storm-winds roar.

   He abideth who confideth,

   God is God forevermore.


   Thrones are falling, heathen raging,

   Peoples dreaming as of yore

   Vain imaginations, waging

   Man with man, unmeaning war.

   He abideth who confideth,

   Christ is King forevermore.


   Human wisdom in confusion,

   Casts away the forms it wore;

   Ancient error, new illusion,

   Lose the phantom fruit they bore,

   He abideth who confideth,

   Truth is truth forevermore.


   Right eternal, Love immortal,

   Built the House where we adore;

   Mercy is its golden portal,

   Virtue its unshaken floor.

   He abideth who confideth,

   God is God forevermore.

VICTORIA

   "Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."--St. John XVI:33.

   C. M.

   [7]St. Anne.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   Thy victory is in the heart,

   Thy kingdom is within;

   When outward pride and pomp depart,

   Thy glory doth begin.


   Thine army, ever in the field,

   Is led by love and light;

   Thy followers fall but never yield,

   Triumphant in the right.


   O King most meek and wonderful,

   Grant us among Thy host,

   To follow Thee, to fight for Thee,

   Knights of the Holy Ghost.

THREE EARLIER HYMNS


   Hymn of Joy

   Peace Hymn of the Republic


   --From "Poems of Henry van Dyke"

   Copyright 1911-1920 by

   Charles Scribner's Sons.

HYMN OF LABOR

   8.7.8.7.D

   [8]Beecher.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   Jesus, Thou divine Companion,

   By Thy lowly human birth

   Thou hast come to join the workers,

   Burden-bearers of the earth.

   Thou, the Carpenter of Naz'reth,

   Toiling for Thy daily food,

   By Thy patience and Thy courage,

   Thou hast taught us toil is good.


   They who tread the path of labor

   Follow where Thy feet have trod;

   They who work without complaining

   Do the holy will of God.

   Thou, the peace that passeth knowledge,

   Dwellest in the daily strife;

   Thou, the Bread of heaven, art broken

   In the sacrament of life.


   Every task, however simple,

   Sets the soul that does it free;

   Every deed of love and kindness

   Done to man is done to Thee.

   Jesus, Thou divine Companion,

   Help us all to work our best;

   Bless us in our daily labor,

   Lead us to our Sabbath rest.
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN OF JOY

   8.7.8.7.D

   [9]Music from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,

   God of glory, Lord of love;

   Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee,

   Praising Thee their sun above.

   Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;

   Drive the dark of doubt away;

   Giver of immortal gladness,

   Fill us with the light of day!


   All Thy works with joy surround Thee,

   Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays,

   Stars and angels sing around Thee,

   Centre of unbroken praise:

   Field and forest, vale and mountain,

   Blooming meadow, billowing sea,

   Chanting bird and flowing fountain,

   Call us to rejoice in Thee.


   Thou art giving and forgiving,

   Ever blessing, ever blest,

   Well-spring of the joy of living,

   Ocean-depth of happy rest.

   Thou our Father, Christ our Brother,--

   All who live in love are Thine:

   Teach us how to love each other,

   Lift us to the Joy Divine.


   Mortals join the mighty chorus,

   Which the morning stars began;

   Father-love is reigning o'er us,

   Brother-love binds man to man.

   Ever singing march we onward,

   Victors in the midst of strife;

   Joyful music lifts us sunward

   In the triumph song of life.

PEACE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC

   C.M.D.

   [10]Materna.

   Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933)


   O Lord, our God, Thy mighty hand

   Hath made our country free;

   From all her broad and happy land

   May praise arise to Thee.

   Fulfil the promise of her youth,

   Her liberty defend;

   By law and order, love and truth,

   America befriend!


   The strength of every state increase

   In Union's golden chain;

   Her thousand cities fill with peace,

   Her million fields with grain.

   The virtues of her mingled blood

   In one new people blend;

   By unity and brotherhood

   America befriend!


   O suffer not her feet to stray;

   But guide her untaught might,

   That she may walk in peaceful day,

   And lead the world in light.

   Bring down the proud, lift up the poor,

   Unequal ways amend;

   By justice, nation-wide and sure,

   America befriend!


   Through all the waiting land proclaim

   Thy gospel of good-will;

   And may the music of Thy name

   In every bosom thrill.

   O'er hill and vale, from sea to sea,

   Thy holy reign extend;

   By faith and hope and charity,

   America befriend!
