Introduction

   The work unto which the servant of Christ is called is many-sided. Not
   only is he to preach the Gospel to the unsaved, to feed God's people
   with knowledge and understanding (Jer 3:15), and to take up the
   stumbling stone out of their way (Isa. 57:14), but he is also charged
   to "cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My
   people their transgression" (Isa 58:1 and cf. 1 Tim 4:2). While another
   important part of his commission is stated in, "Comfort ye, My people,
   said your God" (Isa 40:1). What an honourable title, "My people!" What
   an assuring relationship: "your God!" What a pleasant task: "comfort ye
   My people!" A threefold reason may be suggested for the duplicating of
   the charge. First, because sometimes the souls of believers refuse to
   be comforted (Psa 77:2), and the consolation needs to be repeated.
   Second, to press this duty the more emphatically upon the preacher's
   heart, that he need not be sparing in administering cheer. Third, to
   assure us how heartily desirous God himself is that His people should
   be of good cheer (Phil 4:4). God has a "people," the objects of His
   special favour: a company whom He has taken into such intimate
   relationship unto Himself that He calls them "My people." Often they
   are disconsolate: because of their natural corruptions, the temptations
   of Satan, the cruel treatment of the world, the low state of Christ's
   cause upon earth. The "God of all comfort" (2 Cor 1:3) is very tender
   of them, and it is His revealed will that His servants should bind up
   the broken-hearted and pour the balm of Gilead into their wounds. What
   cause have we to exclaim "Who is a God like unto Thee!" (Micah 7:18),
   who has provided for the comfort of those who were rebels against His
   government and transgressors of His Law.

   The contents of this little volume have appeared from time to time in
   our monthly magazine during the last thirty years. They were,
   previously, sermons which we preached long ago in the U.S.A. and
   Australia. Here and there is an expression (especially where Prophecy
   is touched upon) that we would not use today; but since the Lord was
   pleased to bless them in their original form to not a few of His
   distressed people, we have not revised them. May it please Him to speak
   peace by them to afflicted souls today, and the glory shall be His
   alone.

CHAPTER 1

  No Condemnation

   "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
   Jesus" (Romans 8:1)

   "(There is) therefore now no condemnation." The eighth chapter of the
   epistle to the Romans concludes the first section of that wonderful
   epistle. Its opening word "Therefore" ("There is" is in italics,
   because supplied by the translators) may be viewed in a twofold way.
   First, it connects with all that has been said from 3:21. An inference
   is now deduced from the whole of the preceding discussion, an inference
   which was, in fact, the grand conclusion toward which the apostle had
   been aiming throughout the entire argument. Because Christ has been set
   forth "a propitiation through faith in His blood" (3:25); because He
   was "delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification"
   (4:25); because by the obedience of the One the many (believers of all
   ages) are "made righteous," constituted so, legally, (5:19); because
   believers have "died (judicially) to sin" (6:2); because they have
   "died" to the condemning power of the law (7:4), there is "therefore
   now NO CONDEMNATION."

   But not only is the "therefore" to be viewed as a conclusion drawn from
   the whole of the previous discussion, it is also to be considered as
   having a close relation to what immediately precedes. In the second
   half of Romans 7 the apostle had described the painful and ceaseless
   conflict which is waged between the antagonistic natures in the one who
   has been born again, illustrating this by a reference to his own
   personal experiences as a Christian. Having portrayed with a master
   pen-himself sitting for the picture-the spiritual struggles of the
   child of God, the apostle now proceeds to direct attention to the
   Divine consolation for a condition so distressing and humiliating. The
   transition from the despondent tone of the seventh chapter to the
   triumphant language of the eighth appears startling and abrupt, yet is
   quite logical and natural. If it is true that to the saints of God
   belongs the conflict of sin and death, under whose effect they mourn,
   equally true is it that their deliverance from the curse and the
   corresponding condemnation is a victory in which they rejoice. A very
   striking contrast is thus pointed.

   In the second half of Romans 7 the apostle treats the power of sin,
   which operates in believers as long as they are in the world; in the
   opening verses of chapter eight, he speaks of the guilt of sin from
   which they are completely delivered the moment they are united to the
   Saviour by faith. Hence in 7:24 the apostle asks "Who shall deliver me"
   from the power of sin, but in 8:2 he says, "hath made me free," i.e.
   hath delivered me, from the guilt of sin. "(There is) therefore now no
   condemnation." It is not here a question of our heart condemning us (as
   in 1 John 3:21), nor of us finding nothing within which is worthy of
   condemnation; instead, it is the far more blessed fact that God
   condemns not the one who has trusted in Christ to the saving of his
   soul. We need to distinguish sharply between subjective and objective
   truth; between that which is judicial and that which is experimental;
   otherwise, we shall fail to draw from such Scriptures as the one now
   before us the comfort and peace they are designed to convey. There is
   no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus. "In Christ" is the
   believer's position before God, not his condition in the flesh. "In
   Adam" I was condemned (Rom 5:12); but "in Christ" is to be forever
   freed from all condemnation. "(There is) therefore now no
   condemnation." The qualifying "now" implies there was a time when
   Christians, before they believed, were under condemnation. This was
   before they died with Christ, died judicially (Gal 2:20) to the penalty
   of God's righteous law. This "now," then, distinguishes between two
   states or conditions. By nature we were "under the (sentence of) law,"
   but now believers are "under grace" (Rom 6:14). By nature we were
   "children of wrath" (Eph. 2:2), but now we are "accepted in the
   Beloved" (Eph. 1:6). Under the first covenant we were "in Adam" (1 Cor
   15:22), but now we are "in Christ" (Rom 8:1). As believers in Christ we
   have everlasting life, and because of this we "shall not come into
   condemnation."

   Condemnation is a word of tremendous import, and the better we
   understand it the more shall we appreciate the wondrous grace that has
   delivered us from its power. In the halls of a human court this is a
   term which falls with fearful knell upon the ear of the convicted
   criminal and fills the spectators with sadness and horror. But in the
   court of Divine Justice it is vested with a meaning and content
   infinitely more solemn and awe-inspiring. To that Court every member of
   Adam's fallen race is cited. "Conceived in sin, shapen in iniquity"
   each one enters this world under arrest - an indicted criminal, a rebel
   manacled. How, then, is it possible for such a one to escape the
   execution of the dread sentence? There was only one way, and that was
   by the removal from us of that which called forth the sentence, namely
   sin. Let guilt be removed and there can be "no condemnation." Has guilt
   been removed, removed, we mean, from the sinner who believes? Let the
   Scriptures answer: "As far as the east is from the west so far hath he
   removed our transgressions from us" (Psa 103:12). "I, even I, am he
   that blotteth out thy transgressions" (Isa 43:25). "Thou hast cast all
   my sins behind thy back" (Isa 38:17). "Their sins and iniquities will I
   remember no more" (Heb. 10:17).

   But how could guilt be removed? Only by it being transferred. Divine
   holiness could not ignore it; but Divine grace could and did transfer
   it. The sins of believers were transferred to Christ: "The Lord hath
   laid on him the iniquity of us all" (Isa 53:6). "For he hath made him
   to be sin for us" (2 Cor 5:21). "(There is) therefore no condemnation."
   The "no" is emphatic. It signifies there is no condemnation whatsoever.
   No condemnation from the law, or on account of inward corruption, or
   because Satan can substantiate a charge against me; there is none from
   any source or for any cause at all. "No condemnation" means that none
   at all is possible; that none ever will be. There is no condemnation
   because there is no accusation (see 8:33), and there can be no
   accusation because there is no imputation of sin (see 4:8). "(There is)
   therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus."

   When treating of the conflict between the two natures in the believer
   the apostle had, in the previous chapter, spoken of himself in his own
   person, in order to show that the highest attainments in grace do no
   exempt from the internal warfare which he there describes. But here in
   8:1 the apostle changes the number. He does not say, There is no
   condemnation to me, but "to them which are in Christ Jesus." This was
   most gracious of the Holy Spirit. Had the apostle spoken here in the
   singular number, we should have reasoned that such a blessed exemption
   was well suited to this honored servant of God who enjoyed such
   wondrous privileges; but could not apply to us. The Spirit of God,
   therefore, moved the apostle to employ the plural number here, to show
   that "no condemnation" is true of all in Christ Jesus. "(There is)
   therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." To be
   in Christ Jesus is to be perfectly identified with Him in the judicial
   reckoning and dealings of God: and it is also to be one with Him as
   vitally united by faith. Immunity from condemnation does not depend in
   any-wise upon our "walk," but solely on our being "in Christ." "The
   believer is in Christ as Noah was enclosed within the ark, with the
   heavens darkening above him, and the waters heaving beneath him, yet
   not a drop of the flood penetrating his vessel, not a blast of the
   storm disturbing the serenity of his spirit. The believer is in Christ
   as Jacob was in the garment of the elder brother when Isaac kissed and
   blessed him. He is in Christ as the poor homicide was within the city
   of refuge when pursued by the avenger of blood, but who could not
   overtake and slay him" (Dr. Winslow, 1857). And because he is "in
   Christ" there is, therefore, no condemnation for him. Hallelujah!

CHAPTER 2

  The Christian's Assurance

   "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love
   God to them who are the called according to His purpose." (Romans
   8:28).

   How many of God's children have, through the centuries, drawn strength
   and comfort from this blessed verse. In the midst of trials,
   perplexities, and persecutions, this has been a rock beneath their
   feet. Though to outward sight things seemed to work against their good,
   though to carnal reason things appeared to be working for their ill,
   nevertheless, faith knew it was for otherwise. And how great the loss
   to those who failed to rest upon this inspired declaration: what
   unnecessary fears and doubtings were the consequence.

   "All things work together." The first thought occurring to us is this:
   What a glorious Being our God be, who is able to make all things so
   work! What a frightful amount of evil there is in constant activity.
   What an almost infinite number of creatures there are in the world.
   What an incalculable quantity of opposing self-interests at work. What
   a vast army of rebels fighting against God. What hosts of super-human
   creatures over opposing the Lord. And yet, high above all, is GOD, in
   undisturbed calm, complete master of the situation. There, from the
   throne of His exalted majesty, He worketh all things after the counsel
   of His own will (Eph. 1:11). Stand in awe, then, before this One in
   whose sight "all nations are as nothing; and they are counted as less
   than nothing, and vanity " (Isa. 40:17). Bow in adoration before this
   "high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity" (Isa. 57:15). Lift high
   your praise unto Him who from the direct evil can educe the greatest
   good. "All things work." In nature there is no such thing as a vacuum,
   neither is there a creature of God that fails to serve its designed
   purpose. Nothing is idle. Everything is energized by God so as to
   fulfill its intended mission. All things are laboring toward the grand
   end of their Creator's pleasure: all are moved at His imperative
   bidding.

   "All things work together." They not only operate, they co-operate;
   they all act in perfect concert, though none but the anointed ear can
   catch the strains of their harmony. All things work together, not
   simply but conjointly, as adjunct causes and mutual helps. That is why
   afflictions seldom come solitary and alone. Cloud rises upon cloud:
   storm upon storm. As with Job, one messenger of woe was quickly
   succeeded by another, burdened with tidings of yet heavier sorrow.
   Nevertheless, even here faith may trace both the wisdom and love of
   God. It is the compounding of the ingredients in the recipe that
   constitutes its beneficent value. So with God: His dispensations not
   only "work," but they "work together." So recognized the sweet singer
   of Israel - "He drew me out of many waters" (Psa. 18:16). "All things
   work together for good to," etc. These words teach believers that no
   matter what may be the number nor how overwhelming the character of
   adverse circumstances, they are all contributing to conduct them into
   the possession of the inheritance provided for them in heaven.

   How wonderful is the providence of God in over-ruling things most
   disorderly, and in turning to our good things which in themselves are
   most pernicious! We marvel at His mighty power which holds the heavenly
   bodies in their orbits; we wonder at the continually recurring seasons
   and the renewal of the earth; but this is not nearly so marvellous as
   His bringing good out of evil in all the complicated occurrences of
   human life, and making even the power and malice of Satan, with the
   naturally destructive tendency of his works, to minister good for His
   children. "All things work together for good." This must be so for
   three reasons. First, because all things are under the absolute control
   of the Governor of the universe. Second, because God desires our good,
   and nothing but our good. Third, because even Satan himself cannot
   touch a hair of our heads without God's permission, and then only for
   our further good. Not all things are good in themselves, nor in their
   tendencies; but God makes all things work for our good. Nothing enters
   our life by blind chance: nor are there any accidents. Everything is
   being moved by God, with this end in view, our good. Everything being
   subservient to God's eternal purpose, works blessing to those marked
   out for conformity to the image of the Firstborn. All suffering,
   sorrow, loss, are used by our Father to minister to the benefit of the
   elect.

   "To them that love God." This is the grand distinguishing feature of
   every true Christian. The reverse marks all the unregenerate. But the
   saints are those who love God. Their creeds may differ in minor
   details; their ecclesiastical relations may vary in outward form; their
   gifts and graces may be very unequal; yet, in this particular there is
   an essential unity. They all believe in Christ, they all love God. They
   love Him for the gift of the Saviour: they love Him as a Father in whom
   they may confide: they love Him for His personal excellencies - His
   holiness, wisdom, faithfulness. They love Him for His conduct: for what
   He withholds and for what He grants: for what He rebukes and for what
   He approves. They love Him even for the rod that disciplines, knowing
   that He doth all things well. There is nothing in God, and there is
   nothing from God, for which the saints do not love Him. And of this
   they are all assured, "We love Him because He first loved us."

   "To them that love God." But, alas, how little I love God! I so
   frequently mourn my lack of love, and chide myself for the coldness of
   my heart. Yes, there is so much love of self and love of the world,
   that sometimes I seriously question if I have any real love for God at
   all. But is not my very desire to love God a good symptom? Is not my
   very grief that I love Him so little a sure evidence that I do not hate
   Him? The presence of a hard and ungrateful heart has been mourned over
   by the saints of all ages. "Love to God is a heavenly aspiration, that
   is ever kept in check by the drag and restraint of an earthly nature;
   and from which we shall not be unbound till the soul has made its
   escape from the vile body, and cleared its unfettered way to the realm
   of light and liberty" (Dr. Chalmers).

   "Who are called." The word "called" is never, in the New Testament
   Epistles, applied to those who are the recipients of a mere external
   invitation of the Gospel. The term always signifies an inward and
   effectual call. It was a call over which we had no control, either in
   originating or frustrating it. So in Rom. 1:6,7 and many other
   passages: "Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: to all
   that be in Rome, beloved of God, called saints."

   Has this call reached you, my reader? Ministers have called you: the
   Gospel has called you, conscience has called you: but has the Holy
   Spirit called you with an inward and irresistible call? Have you been
   spiritually called from darkness to light, from death to life, from the
   world to Christ, from self to God? It is a matter of the greatest
   moment that you should know whether you have been truly called of God.
   Has, then, the thrilling, life-giving music of that call sounded and
   reverberated through all the chambers of your soul? But how may I be
   sure that I have received such a call? There is one thing right here in
   our text which should enable you to ascertain. They who have been
   efficaciously called, love God. Instead of hating Him, they now esteem
   Him; instead of fleeing from Him in terror, they now seek Him; instead
   of caring not whether their conduct honored Him; their deepest desire
   now is to please and glorify Him.

   "According to His purpose." The call is not according to the merits of
   men, but according to the Divine purpose: "Who hath saved us, and
   called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but
   according to this own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ
   Jesus before the world began" (2 Tim. 1:9). The design of the Holy
   Spirit in bringing in this last clause is to show that the reason some
   men love God and others do not is to be attributed solely to the mere
   sovereignty of God: it is not for anything in themselves, but due alone
   to His distinguishing grace. There is also a practical value in this
   last clause. The doctrines of grace are intended for a further purpose
   than that of making up a creed. One main design of them is to move the
   affections; and more especially to reawaken that affection to which the
   heart oppressed with fears, or weighed down with cares, is wholly
   insufficient - even the love of God. That this love may flow
   perennially from our hearts, there must be a constant recurring to that
   which inspired it and which is calculated to increase it; just as to
   re-kindle your admiration of a beautiful scene or picture, you would
   return again to gaze upon it. It is on this principle that so much
   stress is laid in Scripture on keeping the truths which we believe in
   memory: "By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I
   preached unto you" (1 Cor. 15:2). "I stir up your pure minds by way of
   remembrance," said the apostle (2 Pet. 3:1). "Do this in remembrance of
   me" said the Saviour. It is, then, by going back in memory to that hour
   when, despite our wretchedness and utter unworthiness, God called us,
   that our affection will be kept fresh. It is by recalling the wondrous
   grace that then reached out to a hell-deserving sinner and snatched you
   as a brand from the burning, that your heart will be drawn out in
   adoring gratitude. And it is by discovering this was due alone to the
   sovereign and eternal "purpose" of God that you were called when so
   many others are passed by, that your love for Him will be deepened.
   Returning to the opening words of our text, we find the apostle (as
   voicing the normal experience of the saints) declares, "We know that
   all things work together for good."

   It is something more than a speculative belief. That all things work
   together for good is even more than a fervent desire. It is not that we
   merely hope that all things will so work, but that we are fully assured
   all things do so work. The knowledge here spoken of is spiritual, not
   intellectual. It is a knowledge rooted in our hearts, which produces
   confidence in the truth of it. It is the knowledge of faith, which
   receives everything from the benevolent hand of Infinite Wisdom. It is
   true that we do not derive much comfort from this knowledge when out of
   fellowship with God. Nor will it sustain us when faith is not in
   operation. But when we are in communion with the Lord, when in our
   weakness we do lean hard upon Him, then is this blessed assurance ours:
   "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee:
   because he trusteth in Thee" (Isa. 26:3). A striking exemplification of
   our text is supplied by the history of Jacob - one whom in several
   respects each of us closely resembles. Heavy and dark was the cloud
   which settled upon him. Severe was the test, and fearful the trembling
   of his faith. His feet were almost gone. Hear his mournful plaint: "And
   Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children:
   Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all
   these things are against me" (Gen. 42:36). And yet those circumstances,
   which to the dim eye of his faith wore a hue so somber, were at that
   very moment developing and perfecting the events which were to shed
   around the evening of his life the halo of a glorious and cloudless
   sunset. All things were working together for his good! And so, troubled
   soul, the "much tribulation" will soon be over, and as you enter the
   "kingdom of God" you shall then see, no longer "through a glass darkly"
   but in the unshadowed sunlight of the Divine presence, that "all
   things" did "work together" for your personal and eternal good.

CHAPTER 3

  Sufferings Compensated

   "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy
   to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us" (Romans
   8:18).

   Ah, says someone, that must have been written by a man who was a
   stranger to suffering, or by one acquainted with nothing more trying
   than the milder irritations of life. Not so. These words were penned
   under the direction of the Holy Spirit, and by one who drank deeply of
   sorrow's cup, yea, by one who suffered afflictions in their acutest
   forms. Hear his own testimony: "Of the Jews five times received I forty
   stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned,
   thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
   in journeyings often, in perils of robbers, in perils of mine own
   countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils
   in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false
   brethren; in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger
   and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness" (2 Cor.
   11:24-27). "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are
   not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in
   us."

   This, then was the settled conviction not of one of "fortune's
   favourites," not of one who found life's journey a carpeted pathway,
   bordered with roses, but, instead, of one who was hated by his kinsmen,
   who was oft-times beaten black and blue, who knew what it was to be
   deprived not only of the comforts but the bare necessities of life.
   How, then shall we account for his cheery optimism? What was the secret
   of his elevation over his troubles and trials?

   The first thing with which the sorely-tried apostle comforted himself
   was that the sufferings of the Christian are but of brief duration -
   they are limited to "this present time." This is in sharp and solemn
   contrast from the sufferings of the Christ-rejector. His sufferings
   will be eternal: forever tormented in the Lake of Fire. But far
   different is it for the believer. His sufferings are restricted to this
   life on earth, which is compared to a flower that cometh forth and is
   cut down, to a shadow that fleeth and continueth not. A few short years
   at most, and we shall pass from this vale of tears into that blissful
   country where groans and sighs are never heard.

   Second, the apostle looked forward with the eye of faith to "the
   glory." To Paul "the glory" was something more than a beautiful dream.
   It was a practical reality, exerting a powerful influence upon him,
   consoling him in the warmest and most trying hours of adversity. This
   is one of the real tests of faith. The Christian has a solid support in
   the time of affliction, when the unbeliever has not. The child of God
   knows that in his Father's presence there is "fullness of joy," and
   that at His right hand there are "pleasures forever more." And faith
   lays hold of them, appropriates them, and lives in the comforting cheer
   of them even now. Just as Israel in the wilderness were encouraged by a
   sight of what awaited them in the promised land (Num. 13:23,26), so,
   the one who today walks by faith, and not by sight, contemplates that
   which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, but which God by His Holy
   Spirit hath revealed unto us (1 Cor. 2:9,10).

   Third, the apostle rejoiced in "the glory which should be revealed in
   us." All that this means we are not yet capable of understanding. But
   more than a hint has been vouchsafed us. There will be: (a) The "glory"
   of a perfect body. In that day this corruption shall have put on
   incorruption, and this mortal, immortality. That which was sown in
   dishonour shall be raised in glory, and that which was sown in weakness
   shall be raised in power. As we have borne the image of the earthly, we
   shall also bear the image of the heavenly (1 Cor. 15:49). The content
   of these expressions is summarized and amplified in Phil. 3:20,21: "For
   our conservation is in heaven: from whence also we look for the
   Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall change our vile body, that it
   may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the working
   whereby He is able even to subdue all things unto Himself." (b) There
   will be the glory of a transformed mind. "For now we see through a
   glass darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall
   I know even as also I am known" (1 Cor. 13:12). Oh, what an orb of
   intellectual light will be each glorified mind! What range of light
   will it encompass! What capability of understanding will it enjoy! Then
   will all mysteries be unraveled, all problems solved, all discrepancies
   reconciled. Then shall each truth of God's revelation, each event of
   His providence, each decision of His government, stand yet more
   transparently clear and resplendent than the sun itself. Do you, in
   your present quest for spiritual knowledge, mourn the darkness of your
   mind, the weakness of your memory, the limitations of your intellectual
   faculties? Then rejoice in hope of the glory that is to be revealed in
   you - when all your intellectual powers shall be renewed, developed,
   perfected, so that you shall know even as you are known. (c) Best of
   all, there will be the glory of perfect holiness. God's work of grace
   in us will then be completed. He has promised to "perfect that which
   concerneth us" (Psa. 138:8). Then will be the consummation of purity.
   We have been predestinated to be "conformed to the image of His Son"
   (Rom. 8:29), and when we shall see Him, "we shall be like him" (1 John
   3:2). Then our minds will be no more defiled by evil imaginations, our
   consciences no more sullied by a sense of guilt, our affections no more
   ensnared by unworthy objects. What a marvelous prospect is this! A
   "glory" to be revealed in me who now can scarcely reflect a solitary
   ray of light! In me - so wayward, so unworthy, so sinful; living so
   little in communion with Him who is the Father of lights! Can it be
   that in me this glory shall be revealed? So affirms the infallible Word
   of God. If I am a child of light-through being "in Him" who is the
   effulgence of the Father's glory-even though now dwelling amid the
   world's dark shades, one day I shall outshine the brightness of the
   firmament. And when the Lord Jesus returns to this earth. he shall "be
   admired in all them that believe" (II Thess. 1:10).

   Finally, the apostle here weighed the "sufferings" of this present time
   over against the "glory" which shall be revealed in us, and as he did
   so he declared that the one is "not worthy to be compared" with the
   other. The one is transient, the other eternal. As, then, there is no
   proportion between the finite and the infinite, so there is no
   comparison between the sufferings of earth and the glory of heaven. One
   second of glory will outweigh a lifetime of suffering. What were the
   years of toil, of sickness, of battling with poverty, of sorrow in any
   or every form, when compared with the glory of Immanuel's land! One
   draught of the river of pleasure at God's right hand, one breath of
   Paradise, one hour amid the blood-washed around the throne, shall more
   than compensate for all the tears and groans of earth. "For I reckon
   that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared
   with the glory which shall be revealed in us." May the Holy Spirit
   enable both writer and reader to lay hold of this with appropriating
   faith and live in the present possession and enjoyment of it to the
   praise of the glory of Divine grace.

CHAPTER 4

  The Great Giver

   "He that spared not His own Son but delivered Him up for us all how
   shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" (Romans 8:32).

   The above verse supplies us with an instance of Divine logic. It
   contains a conclusion drawn from a premise; the premise is that God
   delivered up Christ for all His people, therefore everything else that
   is needed by them is sure to be given. There are many examples in Holy
   Writ of such Divine logic. "If God so clothe the grass of the field,
   which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
   more clothe you?" (Matt. 6:30). "If when we were enemies we were
   reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled,
   we shall be saved by his life" (Rom. 5:10). "If ye then being evil,
   know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall
   your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?"
   (Matt. 7:11). So here in our text the reasoning is irresistible and
   goes straight to the understanding and heart. Our text tells of the
   gracious character of our loving God as interpreted by the gift of His
   Son. And this, not merely for the instruction of our minds, but for the
   comfort and assurance of our hearts. The gift of His own Son is God's
   guarantee to His people of all needed blessings. The greater includes
   the less; His unspeakable spiritual gift is the pledge of all needed
   temporal mercies. Note in our text four things:

   1. The Father's Costly Sacrifice. This brings before us a side of the
   truth upon which I fear we rarely meditate. We delight to think of the
   wondrous love of Christ, whose love was stronger than death, and who
   deemed no suffering too great for His people. But what must it have
   meant to the heart of the Father when His Beloved left His Heavenly
   Home! God is love, and nothing is so sensitive as love. I do not
   believe that Deity is emotionless, the Stoic as represented by the
   Schoolmen of the Middle Ages. I believe the sending forth of the Son
   was something which the heart of the Father felt, that it was a real
   sacrifice on His part. Weigh well then the solemn fact which premises
   the sure promise that follows: God "spared not His own Son"!
   Expressive, profound, melting words! Knowing full well, as He only
   could, all that redemption involved-the Law rigid and unbending,
   insisting upon perfect obedience and demanding death for its
   transgressors. Justice, stern and inexorable, requiring full
   satisfaction, refusing to "clear the guilty." Yet God withheld not the
   only Sacrifice which could meet the case. God "spared not His own Son,"
   though knowing full well the humiliation and ignominy of Bethlehem's
   manger, the ingratitude of men, the not having where to lay His head,
   the hatred and opposition of the ungodly, the enmity and bruising of
   Satan-yet He did not hesitate. God did not relax ought of the holy
   requirements of His throne, nor abate one whit of the awful curse. No,
   He "spared not His own Son." The utmost farthing was exacted; the last
   dregs in the cup of wrath must be drained. Even when His Beloved cried
   from the Garden, "if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me," God
   "spared" Him not. Even when vile hands had nailed Him to the tree, God
   cried "Awake, Oh sword, against My Shepherd, and against the man that
   is My Fellow, saith the Lord of Hosts; smite the Shepherd" (Zech.
   13:7).

   2. The Father's Gracious Design. "But delivered him up for us all."
   Here we are told why the Father made such a costly sacrifice; He spared
   not Christ, that He might spare us! It was not want of love to the
   Saviour, but wondrous, matchless, fathomless love for us! Oh marvel at
   the wondrous design of the Most High. "God so loved the world that he
   gave his only begotten Son." Verily, such love passeth knowledge.
   Moreover, He made this costly sacrifice not grudgingly or reluctantly,
   but freely- out of love. Once God had said to rebellious Israel, "How
   shall I give thee up, Ephraim?" (Hosea 11:8). Infinitely more cause had
   He to say this of the Holy One, His well-beloved, the One in whom His
   soul daily delighted. Yet, He "delivered Him up"-to shame and spitting,
   to hatred and persecution, to suffering and death itself. And He
   delivered Him up for us-descendants of rebellious Adam, depraved and
   defiled, corrupt and sinful, vile and worthless! For us who had gone
   into the "far country" of alienation from Him, and there spent our
   substance in riotous living. Yes, "for us" who had gone astray like
   sheep, each one turning to "his own way." For us "who were by nature
   the children of wrath, even as others," in whom there dwelt no good
   thing. For us who had rebelled against our Creator, hated His holiness,
   despised His Word, broken His commandments, resisted His Spirit. For us
   who richly deserved to be cast into the everlasting burnings and
   receive those wages which our sins so fully earned. Yes, for thee
   fellow Christian, who art sometimes tempted to interpret your
   afflictions as tokens of God's hardness; who regard your poverty as a
   mark of His neglect, and your seasons of darkness as evidences of His
   desertion. O, confess to Him now the wickedness of such dishonouring
   doubtings, and never again question the love of Him who spared not His
   own Son, but delivered Him up for us all. Faithfulness demands that I
   should point out the qualifying pronoun in our text. It is not God
   "delivered him up for all," but "for us all." 'This is definitely
   defined in the verses which immediately precede. In v. 31 the question
   is asked, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" In v. 30 this "us"
   is defined as those whom God did predestinate and has "called" and
   "justified." The "us" are the high favorites of heaven, the objects of
   sovereign grace. God's elect. And yet in themselves they are, by nature
   and practice, deserving of nothing but wrath. But yet, thank God, it is
   "us all" -the worst as well as the best, the five-hundred-pounds-debtor
   equally as much as the fifty-pence-debtor.

   3. The Spirit's Blessed Inference. Ponder well the glorious
   "conclusion" which the Spirit of God here draws from the wondrous fact
   stated in the first part of our text, "He that spared not his own Son,
   but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely
   give us all things." How conclusive and how comforting is the inspired
   reasoning of the apostle. Arguing from the greater to the less, He
   proceeds to assure the believer of God's readiness to also freely
   bestow all needed blessings. The gift of His own Son, so ungrudgingly
   and unreservedly bestowed, is the pledge of every other needed mercy.
   Here is the unfailing guaranty and talisman of perpetual reassurance to
   the drooping spirit of the tried believer. If God has done the greater,
   will He leave the less undone? Infinite love can never change. The love
   that spared not Christ cannot fail its objects nor begrudge any needed
   blessings. The sad thing is that our hearts dwell upon what we have
   not, instead of upon what we do have. Therefore the Spirit of God would
   here still our restless self-communings and quiet the repinings of
   ignorance with a soul-satisfying knowledge of the truth, by reminding
   us not only of the reality of our interest in the love of God, but also
   of the extent of that blessing which flows therefrom. Weigh well what
   is involved in the logic of this verse. First, the great Gift was given
   unasked; will He not bestow others for the asking? None of us
   supplicated God to send forth His Beloved; yet He sent Him! Now, we may
   come to the throne of grace and there present our requests in the
   virtuous and all-efficacious name of Christ. Second, the one great Gift
   cost Him much; will He not then bestow the lesser gifts which cost Him
   nothing save the delight of giving! If a friend were to give me a
   valuable picture, would he begrudge the necessary paper and string to
   wrap it in? Or if a loved one made me a present of a precious jewel,
   would he refuse a little15 box to carry it in? How much less will He
   who spared not His own Son, withhold any good thing from them that walk
   uprightly. Third, the one Gift was bestowed when we were enemies; will
   not then God be gracious to us now that we have been reconciled and are
   His friends? If He had designs of mercy for us while we were yet in our
   sins, how much more will He regard us favourably now that we have been
   cleansed from all sin by the precious blood of His Son!

   4. The Comforting Promise. Observe the tense that is used here. It is
   not "how has he not with him also freely given us all things," though
   this is also true, for even now are we "heirs of God" (Rom. 8:17). But
   our text goes further than this: "How shall he not with Him also freely
   give us all things?" The second half of this wondrous verse contains
   something more than a record of the past; it supplies reassuring
   confidence both for the present and for the future. No time-limits are
   to be set upon this "shall." Both now in the present and forever and
   ever in the future God shall manifest Himself as the great Giver.
   Nothing for His glory and for our good will He withhold. The same God
   who delivered up Christ for us all is "without variableness or shadow
   of turning." Mark the manner in which God gives: "How shall he not with
   him also freely give us all things?" God does not have to be coaxed;
   there is no reluctance in Him for us to overcome. He is ever more
   willing to give than we are to receive. Again; He is under no
   obligations to any; if He were, He would bestow of necessity, instead
   of giving "freely." Ever remember that He has a perfect right to do
   with His own as He pleases. He is free to give to whom He wills. The
   word "freely" not only signifies that God is under no constraint, but
   also means that He makes no charge for His gifts, He places no price on
   His blessings. God is no retailer of mercies or barterer of good
   things; if He were, justice would require Him to charge exactly what
   each blessing was worth, and then who among the children of Adam could
   find the wherewithal? No, blessed be His name, God's gifts are "without
   money and without price"- unmerited and unearned. Finally, rejoice over
   the comprehensiveness of this promise: "How shall he not with him also
   freely give us all things?" The Holy Spirit would here regale us with
   the extent of God's wondrous grant. What is it you need, fellow
   Christian? Is it pardon? Then has He not said, "If we confess our sins,
   he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from
   all unrighteousness" (I John 1:9)? Is it grace? Then has He not said,
   "God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always
   having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work" (2
   Cor. 9:8)? Is it a "thorn in the flesh"? this too will be given "there
   was given to me a thorn in the flesh" (2 Cor. 12:7). Is it rest? Then
   heed the Saviour's invitation, "Come unto Me . . . and I will give you
   rest (Matt. 11:28). Is it comfort? Is He not the God of all comfort (2
   Cor. 1:3)? "How shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
   Is it temporal mercies that the reader is in need of? Are your
   circumstances adverse so that you are filled with dismal forebodings?
   Does your cruse of oil and barrel of meal look as though they will soon
   be quite empty? Then spread your need before God, and do it in simple
   childlike faith. Think you that He will bestow the greater blessings of
   grace and deny the lesser ones of Providence? No, "My God shall supply
   all your need" (Phil. 4:19). True, He has not promised to give all you
   ask, for we often ask "amiss." Mark the qualifying clause: "How shall
   he not with him also freely give us all things?" We often desire things
   which would come in between us and Christ if they were granted,
   therefore does God in His faithfulness withhold them.

   Here then are four things which should bring comfort to every renewed
   heart. The Father's costly sacrifice. Our God is a giving God and no
   good thing does He withhold from them that walk uprightly. The Father's
   gracious design. It was for us that Christ was delivered up; it was our
   highest and eternal interests that He had at heart. The Spirit's
   infallible inference. The greater includes the less; the unspeakable
   Gift guarantees the bestowment of all other needed favours. The
   comforting promise. Its sure foundation, its present and future scope,
   its blessed extent, are for the assuring of our hearts and the peace of
   our minds. May the Lord add His blessing to this little meditation.

CHAPTER 5

  The Divine Rememberer

   "Who remembered us in our low estate: for His mercy endureth forever"
   (Psa. 136:23).

   "Who remembered us." This is in striking and blessed contrast from our
   forgettings of Him. Like every other faculty of our beings, the memory
   has been affected by the Fall and bears on it the marks of depravity.
   This is seen from its power to retain what is worthless and the
   difficulty encountered to hold fast that which is good. A foolish
   nursery-rhyme or song heard in youth, is carried with us to the grave;
   a helpful sermon is forgotten within twenty-four hours! But most tragic
   and solemn of all is the ease with which we forget God and His
   countless mercies. But, blessed be His name, God never forgets us. He
   is the faithful Rememberer. We were very much impressed when, on
   consulting the concordance, we found that the first five times the word
   "remember" is used in Scripture, in each case it is connected with God.

   "And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle
   that was with him in the ark" (Gen. 8:1). "And the bow shall be in the
   cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting
   covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is
   upon the earth" (Gen. 9:16). "And it came to pass, when God destroyed
   the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out
   of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in the
   which Lot dwelt" (Gen. 19:29), etc. The first time it is used of man we
   read, "Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him"
   (Gen. 40:23)! The historical reference here is to the children of
   Israel, when they were toiling amid the brick-kilns of Egypt. Truly
   they were in a "low estate": a nation of slaves, groaning beneath the
   lash of merciless task-masters, oppressed by a godless and heartless
   king. But when there was none other eye to pity, Jehovah looked upon
   them and heard their cries of distress. He "remembered" them in their
   low estate. And why? Exodus 2:24,25 tells us: "And God heard their
   groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and
   with Jacob. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had
   respect unto it." And history is to repeat itself. Israel's lowest
   estate has not yet been reached. Fearful as have been their experiences
   during the last nineteen centuries, the blackest hour of their dark
   night is yet before them. After the present Dispensation of Grace is
   ended, yet eighteen sorer judgments will descend on the Jews than those
   which their fathers suffered in the house of bondage. The "great
   tribulation" will be the time when their acutest sufferings will be
   experienced. But even then God will "remember" them. As it is written,
   "Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the
   time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it" (Jer. 30:7).
   He will "remember" His covenant with their ancestors (Lev. 24:42, 44,
   etc.).

   But our text is not to be limited to the literal seed of Abraham: it
   has reference to the whole "Israel of God" (Gal. 6:16). The saints of
   this present Day of salvation also unite in saying, "Who remembered us
   in our low estate." How "low" was our "estate" by nature! As fallen
   creatures we lay in our misery and wretchedness, unable to deliver or
   help ourselves. But, in wondrous grace, God took pity on us. His strong
   arm reached down and rescued us. He came to where we lay, saw us, and
   had compassion on us (Luke 10:33). Therefore can each Christian say,
   "He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
   and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings" (Psa. 40:2).
   And why did He "remember" us? The very word "remember" tells of
   previous thoughts of love and mercy towards us. As it was with the
   children of Israel in Egypt, so it was with us in our ruined condition
   by nature. He "remembered" His covenant, that covenant into which He
   had entered with our Surety from everlasting. As we read in Titus 1:2
   of eternal life "which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world
   was. Promised to Christ, that He would give that eternal life to those
   for whom our covenant Head should transact. Yes, God "remembered" that
   He had "chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world" (Eph.
   1:4), therefore did He, in due time, bring us from death unto life. Yet
   this blessed word goes beyond our initial experience of God's saving
   grace.

   Historically, our text refers not only to God remembering His people
   while they were in Egypt, but also, as the context shows, while they
   were in the Wilderness, on their way to the Promised Land. Israel's
   experiences in the desert but foreshadow the saints' walk through this
   hostile world. And Jehovah's "remembrance" of them, manifested in the
   daily supply of their every need, adumbrated the rich provisions of His
   grace for us while we journey to our Home on High. Our present estate,
   here on earth, is but a lowly one, for we do not now reign as kings.
   Yet, is our God ever mindful of us, and hourly does He minister to us.
   "Who remembered us in our low estate." Not always are we permitted to
   dwell upon the mount. As in the natural world, so in our experiences.
   Bright and sunny days give place to dark and cloudy ones: summer is
   followed by winter. Disappointments, losses, afflictions, bereavements
   came our way, and we were brought low. And ofttimes just when we seemed
   to most need the comfort of friends, they failed us. Those we counted
   on to help, forgot us. But, even then, there was One "who remembered
   us" and showed Himself to be "the same yesterday and today and
   forever," and then did we prove afresh that "His mercy endureth
   forever." "Who remembered us in our low estate." There are some who may
   read these lines that will think of another application of these words:
   namely, the time when you left your first love, when your heart grew
   cold, and your life became worldly. When you were in a sadly
   back-slidden state. Then, indeed, was your estate a low one; yet even
   then did our faithful God "remember" thee. Yes, each of us has cause to
   say with the Psalmist "He restoreth my soul; He leadeth me in the paths
   of righteousness for His name's sake" (23:3). "Who remembered us in our
   low estate."

   Still another application of these words may be made, namely, to the
   last great crisis of the saint, as he passes out of this world. As the
   vital spark of the body grows dim and nature fails, then too is our
   "estate" low. But then also the Lord remembereth us, for "His mercy
   endureth for ever. Man's extremity is but God's opportunity. His
   strength is made perfect in our weakness. It is then that he
   "remembers" us by making good His comforting promises, "Fear thou not,
   for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God; I will
   strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with
   the right hand of My righteousness" (Isa. 41:10). "Who remembered us in
   our low estate." Surely this text will furnish us with suitable words
   to express our thanksgiving when we are at Home, present with the Lord.
   How we shall then praise Him for His covenant faithfulness, His
   matchless grace, and His loving kindness, for having "remembered us in
   our low estate! Then shall we know, even as we are known. Our very
   memories will be renewed, perfected, and we shall remember all the way
   the Lord our God hath led us" (Deut. 8:2), recalling with gratitude and
   joy His faithful remembrances, acknowledging with adoration that "His
   mercy endureth for ever." 20
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 6

  Tried by Fire

   "But he knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tried me I shall come
   forth as gold" (Job 23:10).

   Job here corrects himself. In the beginning of the chapter we find him
   saying: "Even today is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than
   my groaning" (vv. 1 & 2). Poor Job felt that his lot was unbearable.
   But he recovers himself. He checks his hasty outburst and revises his
   impetuous decision. How often we all have to correct ourselves! Only
   One has ever walked this earth who never had occasion to do so.

   Job here comforts himself. He could not fathom the mysteries of
   Providence but God knew the way he took. Job had diligently sought the
   calming presence of God, but, for a time, in vain. Behold I go forward,
   but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him. On the
   left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him" (vv. 8 & 9).
   But he consoled himself with this blessed fact-though I cannot see God,
   what is a thousand times better, He can see me-"He knoweth." One above
   is neither unmindful nor indifferent to our lot. If He notices the fall
   of a sparrow, if He counts the hairs of our heads, of course "He knows"
   the way that I take. Job here enunciates a noble view of life. How
   splendidly optimistic he was! He did not allow his afflictions to turn
   him into a skeptic. He did not permit the sore trials and troubles
   through which he was passing to overwhelm him. He looked at the bright
   side of the dark cloud-God's side, hidden from sense and reason. He
   took a long view of life. He looked beyond the immediate 'fiery trials"
   and said that the outcome would be gold refined. "But he knoweth the
   way that I take: when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold."
   Three great truths are expressed here: let us briefly consider each
   separately.

   1.The Divine Knowledge of My Life. "He knoweth the way that I take."
   The omniscience of God is one of the wondrous attributes of Deity. "For
   his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings" (Job
   34:21). "The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil
   and the good (Prov. 15:3). Spurgeon said, "One of the greatest tests of
   experimental religion is, What is my relationship to God's
   omniscience?" What is your relationship to it, dear reader? How does it
   affect you? Does it distress or comfort you? Do you shrink from the
   thought of God knowing all about your way? perhaps, a lying, selfish,
   hypocritical way! To the sinner this is a terrible thought. He denies
   it, or if not, he seeks to forget it. But to the Christian, here is
   real comfort. How cheering to remember that my Father knows all about
   my trials, my difficulties, my sorrows, my efforts to glorify Him.
   Precious truth for those in Christ, harrowing thought for all out of
   Christ, that the way I am taking is fully known to and observed by God.
   "He knoweth the way that I take." Men did not know the way that Job
   took. He was grievously misunderstood, and for one with a sensitive
   temperament to be misunderstood, is a sore trial. His very friends
   thought he was a hypocrite. They believed he was a great sinner and
   being punished by God. Job knew that he was an unworthy saint, but not
   a hypocrite. He appealed against their censorious verdict. "He knoweth
   the way that I take: when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold."

   Here is instruction for us when like circumstanced. Fellow-believer,
   your fellow-men, yes, and your fellow-Christians, may misunderstand
   you, and misinterpret God's dealings with you: but console yourself
   with the blessed fact that the omniscient One knoweth. "He knoweth the
   way that I take." In the fullest sense of the word Job himself did not
   know the way that he took, nor do any of us. Life is profoundly
   mysterious, and the passing of the years offer no solution. Nor does
   philosophizing help us. Human volition is a strange enigma.
   Consciousness bears witness that we are more than automatons. The power
   of choice is exercised by us in every move we make. And yet it is plain
   that our freedom is not absolute. There are forces brought to bear upon
   us, both good and evil, which are beyond our power to resist. Both
   heredity and environment exercise powerful influences upon us. Our
   surroundings and circumstances are factors which cannot be ignored. And
   what of providence which "shapes our destinies"? Ah, how little do we
   know the way which we "take." Said the prophet, "O Lord I know that the
   way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct
   his steps (Jer. 10:23). Here we enter the realm of mystery, and it is
   idle to deny it. Better far to acknowledge with the wise man, "Man's
   goings are of the Lord; how can a man then understand his own way?"
   (Prov. 20:24). In the narrower sense of the term Job did know the way
   which he took. What that "way" was he tells us in the next two verses.
   "My foot hath held his steps. his way have I kept, and not declined.
   Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have
   esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food" (Job
   23:11, 12).

   The way Job chose was the best way, the scriptural way, God's way-"His
   way." What do you think of that way, dear reader? Was it not a grand
   selection? Ah, not only "patient," but wise Job! Have you made a
   similar choice? Can you say, My foot hath held his steps. his way have
   I kept, and not declined?" (v. 11). If you can, praise Him for His
   enabling grace. If you cannot, confess with shame your failure to
   appropriate His all-sufficient grace. Get down on your knees at once,
   and unbosom yourself to God. Hide and keep back nothing. Remember it is
   written "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
   our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (I John 1:9).
   Does not v. 12 explain your failure, my failure, dear reader? Is it not
   because we have not trembled before God's commandments, and because we
   have so lightly esteemed His Word, that we have "declined" from His
   way! Then let us, even now, and daily, seek grace from on high to heed
   His commandments and hide His Word in our hearts. "He knoweth the way
   that I take." Which way are you taking?- the Narrow Way which leadeth
   unto life, or 'the Broad Road that leadeth to destruction? Make certain
   on this point, dear friend. Scripture declares, "So every one of us
   shall give account of himself to God" (Rom. 14:12). But you need not be
   deceived or uncertain. The Lord declared, "I am The Way" (John 14:6).

   2. Divine Testing "When he hath tried me." "The fining pot is for
   silver, and the furnace for gold: but the Lord trieth the hearts"
   (Prov. 17:3). This was God's way with Israel of old, and it is His way
   with Christians now. Just before Israel entered Canaan, as Moses
   reviewed their history since leaving Egypt, he said, "And thou shalt
   remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years
   in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, and to know what
   as in thine heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments, or no"
   (Deut. 8:2). In the same way God tries, tests, proves, humbles us.
   "When he hath tried me." If we realized this more, we should bear up
   better in the hour of affliction and be more patient under suffering.
   The daily irritations of life, the things which annoy so much-what is
   their meaning? why are they permitted? Here is the answer: God is
   "trying" you! That is the explanation (in part, at least) of that
   disappointment, that crushing of your earthly hopes, that great
   loss,-God was, is, testing you. God is trying your temper, your
   courage, your faith, your patience, your love, your fidelity. "When he
   hath tried me." How frequently God's saints see only Satan as the cause
   of their troubles. They regard the great enemy as responsible for much
   of their sufferings. But there is no comfort for the heart in this. We
   do not deny that the Devil does bring about much that harasses us. But
   above Satan is the Lord Almighty! The Devil cannot touch a hair of our
   heads without God's permission, and when he is allowed to disturb and
   distract us, even then it is only God using him to "try" us. Let us
   learn then, to look beyond all secondary causes and instruments to that
   One who worketh all things after the counsel of His own will (Eph.
   1:11). This is what Job did. In the opening chapter of the book which
   bears his name we find Satan obtaining permission to afflict God's
   servant. He used the Sabeans to destroy Job 's herds (v. 15): he sent
   the Chaldeans to slay his servants (v. 17): he caused a great wind to
   kill his children (v. 19). And what was Job's response? This: he
   exclaimed "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
   name of the Lord" (1:21).

   Job looked beyond the human agents, beyond Satan who employed them, to
   the Lord who controlleth all. He realized that it was the Lord trying
   him. We get the same thing in the New Testament. To the suffering
   saints at Smyrna John wrote, "Fear none of those things which thou
   shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison,
   that ye may be tried" (Rev. 2:10). Their being cast into prison was
   simply God trying them. How much we lose by forgetting this! What a
   stay for the trouble-tossed heart to know that no matter what form the
   testing may take, no matter what the agent which annoys, it is God who
   is "trying" His children. What a perfect example the Saviour sets us.
   When He was approached in the garden and Peter drew his sword and cut
   off the ear of Malchus, the Saviour said, "The cup which My Father hath
   given Me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11). Men were about to vent
   their awful rage upon Him, the Serpent would bruise His heel, but He
   looks above and beyond them. Dear reader, no matter how bitter its
   contents, (infinitely less than that which the Saviour drained) let us
   accept the cup as from the Father's hand.

   In some moods we are apt to question the wisdom and right of God to try
   us. So often we murmur at His dispensations. Why should God lay such an
   intolerable burden upon me? Why should others be spared their loved
   ones, and mine taken? Why should health and strength, perhaps the gift
   of sight, be denied me? The first answer to all such questions is, "O
   man, who art thou that repliest against God?"! It is wicked
   insubordination for any creature to call into question the dealings of
   the great Creator. "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it,
   Why hast Thou made me thus?" (Rom. 9:20). How earnestly each of us need
   to cry unto God, that His grace may silence our rebellious lips and
   still the tempest within our desperately wicked hearts! But to the
   humble soul which bows in submission before the sovereign dispensations
   of the all-wise God, Scripture affords some light on the problem. This
   light may not satisfy reason, but it will bring comfort and strength
   when received in child-like faith and simplicity. In I Pet. 1:6 we
   read; "Wherein (God's salvation) ye greatly rejoice, though now for a
   season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations
   (or trials): That the trial of your faith, being much more precious
   than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
   found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus
   Christ."

   Note three things here. First, there is a needs-be for the trial of
   faith. Since God says it, let us accept it. Second, this trying of
   faith is precious, far more so than of gold. It is precious to God (cf.
   Psa. 116:15) and will yet be so to us. Third, the present trial has in
   view the future. Where the trial has been meekly endured and bravely
   borne, there will be a grand reward at the appearing of our Redeemer.
   Again, in I Pet. 4:12, 13 we are told: "Beloved, think it not strange
   concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange
   thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of
   Christ's sufferings: that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
   glad also with exceeding joy." The same thoughts are expressed here as
   in the previous passage. There is a needs-be for our "trials" and
   therefore we are to think them not strange-we should expect them. And,
   too, there is again the blessed outlook of being richly recompensed at
   Christ's return. Then there is the added word that not only should we
   meet these trials with faith's fortitude, but we should rejoice in
   them, inasmuch as we are permitted to have fellowship in "the
   sufferings of Christ." He, too, suffered: sufficient then, for the
   disciple to be as his Master. "When he hath tried me." Dear Christian
   reader, there are no exceptions. God had only one Son without sin, but
   never one without sorrow. Sooner or later, in one form or another,
   trial-sore and heavy-will be our lot. "And sent Timotheus our brother .
   . . to establish you, and comfort you concerning your faith: That no
   man should be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that we
   are appointed thereunto" (I Thess. 3:2, 3). And again it is written,
   "We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts
   14:22). It has been so in every age. Abram was "tried," tried severely.
   So, too, were Joseph, Jacob. Moses, David, Daniel, the Apostles, etc.

   3. The Ultimate Issue. "I shall come forth as gold." Observe the tense
   here. Job did not imagine that he was pure gold already. "I shall come
   forth as gold," he declared. He knew full well that there was yet much
   dross in him. He did not boast that he was already perfect. Far from
   it. In the final chapter of his book we find him saying, "I abhor
   myself" (42:6). And well he might: and well may we. As we discover that
   in our flesh there dwelleth "no good thing," as we examine ourselves
   and our ways in the light of God's Word and behold our innumerable
   failures, as we think of our countless sins, both of omission and
   commission, good reason have we for abhorring ourselves. Ah, Christian
   reader, there is much dross about us. But it will not ever be thus. "I
   shall come forth as gold." Job did not say, "When he hath tried me I
   may come forth as gold," or "I hope to come forth as gold," but with
   full confidence and positive assurance he declared, "I shall come forth
   as gold." But how did he know this? How can we be sure of the happy
   issue? Because the Divine purpose cannot fail. He which hath begun a
   good work in us "will finish it" (Phil. 1:6). How can we be sure of the
   happy issue? Because the Divine promise is sure: "The Lord will perfect
   that which concerneth me" (Psa. 138:8). Then be of good cheer, tried
   and troubled one. The process may be unpleasant and painful, but the
   issue is charming and sure. "I shall come forth as gold." This was said
   by one who knew affliction and sorrow as few among the sons of men have
   known them. Yet despite his fiery trials he was optimistic. Let then
   this triumphant language be ours. "I shall come forth as gold" is not
   the language of carnal boasting, but the confidence of one whose mind
   was stayed upon God. There will be no credit to our account--the glory
   will all belong to the Divine Refiner. James 1:12.

   For the present there remain two things: first, Love is the Divine
   thermometer while we are in the crucible of testing-"And he shall sit
   (the patience of Divine grace) as a Refiner and Purifier of silver,"
   etc. (Mal. 3:3). Second, the Lord Himself is with us in the fiery
   furnace, as He was with the three young Hebrews (Dan. 3:25). For the
   future this is sure: the most wonderful thing in heaven will not be the
   golden street or the golden harps, but golden souls on which is stamped
   the image of God-"predestinated to be conformed to the image of his
   Son!" Praise God for such a glorious prospect, such a victorious issue,
   such a marvelous goal.

CHAPTER 7

  Divine Chastisement

   "Despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are
   rebuked of him"(Hebrews 12:5).

   It is of first importance that we learn to draw a sharp distinction
   between Divine punishment and Divine chastisement - important for
   maintaining the honour and glory of God, and for the peace of mind of
   the Christian. The distinction is very simple, yet is it often lost
   sight of. God's people can never by any possibility be punished for
   their sins, for God has already punished them at the Cross. The Lord
   Jesus, our Blessed Substitute, suffered the full penalty of all our
   guilt, hence it is written "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth
   us from all sin." Neither the justice nor the love of God will permit
   Him to again exact payment of what Christ discharged to the full. The
   difference between punishment and chastisement lies not in the nature
   of the sufferings of the afflicted: it is most important to bear this
   in mind. There is a threefold distinction between the two.

   First, the character in which God acts. In the former God acts as
   Judge, in the latter as Father. Sentence of punishment is the act of a
   judge, a penal sentence passed on those charged with guilt. Punishment
   can never fall upon the child of God in this judicial sense because his
   guilt was all transferred to Christ: "Who his own self bear our sins in
   his own body on the tree." But while the believer's sins cannot be
   punished, while the Christian cannot be condemned (Rom. 8:3), yet he
   may be chastised. The Christian occupies an entirely different position
   from the non-Christian: he is a member of the Family of God. The
   relationship which now exists between him and God is that of parent and
   child; and as a son he must be disciplined for wrongdoing. Folly is
   bound up in the hearts of all God's children, and the rod is necessary
   to rebuke, to subdue, to humble.

   The second distinction between Divine punishment and Divine
   chastisement lies in the recipients of each. The objects of the former
   are His enemies. The subjects of the latter are His children. As the
   Judge of all the earth, God will yet take vengeance on all His foes. As
   the Father of His family, God maintains discipline over all His
   children. The one is judicial, the other parental.

   A third distinction is seen in The design of each: the one is
   retributive, the other remedial. The one flows from His anger, the
   other from His love. Divine punishment is never sent for the good of
   sinners, but for the honouring of God's law and the vindicating of His
   government. But Divine chastisement is sent for the well-being of His
   children: "We have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we
   gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the
   Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened
   us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be
   partakers of his holiness" (Heb. 12:9-10).

   The above distinction should at once rebuke the thoughts which are so
   generally entertained among Christians. When the believer is smarting
   under the rod let him not say, God is now punishing me for my sins.
   That can never be. That is most dishonouring to the blood of Christ.
   God is correcting thee in love, not smiting in wrath. Nor should the
   Christian regard the chastening of the Lord as a sort of necessary evil
   to which he must bow as submissively as possible. No, it proceeds from
   God's goodness and faithfulness, and is one of the greatest blessings
   for which we have to thank Him. Chastisement evidences our Divine
   son-ship: the father of a family does not concern himself with those on
   the outside: but those within he guides and disciplines to make them
   conform to his will. Chastisement is designed for our good, to promote
   our highest interests. Look beyond the rod to the All-wise hand that
   wields it!

   The Hebrew Christians to whom this Epistle was first addressed were
   passing through a great fight of afflictions, and miserably were they
   conducting themselves. They were the little remnant out of the Jewish
   nation who had believed on their Messiah during the days of His public
   ministry, plus those Jews who had been converted under the preaching of
   the apostles. It is highly probable that they had expected the
   Messianic Kingdom would at once be set up on earth and that they would
   be allotted the chief places of honour in it. But the Millennium had
   not begun, and their own lot became increasingly bitter. They were not
   only hated by the Gentiles, but ostracized by their unbelieving
   brethren, and it became a hard matter for them to make even a bare
   living. Providence held a frowning face. Many who had made a profession
   of Christianity had gone back to Judaism and were prospering
   temporally. As the afflictions of the believing Jews increased, they
   too were sorely tempted to turn their back upon the new Faith. Had they
   been wrong in embracing Christianity? Was high Heaven displeased
   because they had identified themselves with Jesus of Nazareth? Did not
   their suffering go to show that God no longer regarded them with
   favour?

   Now it is most instructive and blessed to see how the Apostle met the
   unbelieving reasoning of their hearts. He appealed to their own
   Scriptures! He reminded them of an exhortation found in Proverbs
   3:11-12, and applied it to their case. Notice, first, the words we
   place in italics: "Ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
   unto you." This shows that the exhortations of the Old Testament were
   not restricted to those who lived under the old covenant: they apply
   with equal force and directness to those of us living under the new
   covenant. Let us not forget that "all Scripture is given by inspiration
   of God and is profitable" (2 Tim. 3:16) The Old Testament equally as
   much as the New Testament was written for our learning and admonition.
   Second, mark the tense of the verb in our opening text: "Ye have
   forgotten the exhortation which speaketh." The Apostle quoted a
   sentence of the Word written one thousand years previously, yet he does
   not say "which hath spoken," but "which speaketh." The same principle
   is illustrated in that sevenfold "He that hath an ear, let him hear
   what the Spirit saith (not "said") unto the churches" of Rev. 2 and 3.
   The Holy Scriptures are a living Word in which God is speaking today!
   Consider now the words "Ye have forgotten." It was not that these
   Hebrew Christians were unacquainted with Prov. 3:11 and 12, but they
   had let them slip. They had forgotten the Fatherhood of God and their
   relation of Him as His dear children. In consequence they
   misinterpreted both the manner and design of God's present dealings
   with them, they viewed His dispensation not in the light of His Love,
   but regarded them as signs of His displeasure or as proofs of His
   forgetfulness. Consequently, instead of cheerful submission, there was
   despondency and despair.

   Here is a most important lesson for us: we must interpret the
   mysterious providences of God not by reason or observation, but by the
   Word. How often we "forget" the exhortation which speaketh unto us as
   unto children- "My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,
   nor faint when thou art rebuked of him." Unhappily there is no word in
   the English language which is capable of doing justice to the Greek
   term here. "Paideia" which is rendered "chastening" is only another
   form of "paidion" which signifies "young children," being the tender
   word that was employed by the Saviour in John 21:5 and Hebrews 2:13.
   One can see at a glance the direct connection which exists between the
   words "disciple" and "discipline": equally close in the Greek is the
   relation between "children" and "chastening." Son-training would be
   better. It has reference to God's education, nurture and discipline of
   His children. It is the Father's wise and loving correction which is in
   view. It is true that much chastisement is the rod in the hand of the
   Father correcting His erring child. But it is a serious mistake to
   confine our thoughts to this one aspect of the subject. Chastisement is
   by no means always the scourging of His refractive sons. Some of the
   saintliest of God's people, some of the most obedient of His children,
   have been and are the greatest sufferers. Oftentimes God's chastenings
   instead of being retributive are corrective. They are sent to empty us
   of self-sufficiency and self-righteousness: they are given to discover
   to us hidden transgressions, and to teach us the plague of our own
   hearts. Or again, chastisements are sent to strengthen our faith, to
   raise us to higher levels of experience, to bring us into a condition
   of usefulness. Still again, Divine chastisement is sent as a
   preventative, to keep under pride, to save us from being unduly elated
   over success in God's service. Let us consider, briefly, four entirely
   different examples.

   DAVID. In his case the rod was laid upon him for grievous sins, for
   open wickedness. His fall was occasioned by self-confidence and
   self-righteousness. If the reader will diligently compare the two Songs
   of David recorded in 2 Samuel 22 and 23, the one written near the
   beginning of his life, the other near the end, he will be struck by the
   great difference of spirit manifested by the writer in each. Read 2
   Samuel 22:22-25 and you will not be surprised that God suffered him to
   have such a fall. Then turn to chapter 23, and mark the blessed change.
   At the beginning of v. 5 there is a heart-broken confession of failure.
   In vv. 10-12 there is a God-glorifying confession, attributing victory
   unto the Lord. The severe scourging of David was not in vain.

   JOB. Probably he tasted of every kind of suffering which falls to man's
   lot: family bereavements, loss of property, grievous bodily afflictions
   came fast, one on top of another. But God's end in it all was that Job
   should benefit therefrom and be a greater partaker of His holiness.
   There was not a little of self-satisfaction and self-righteousness in
   Job at the beginning. But at the end, when He was brought face to face
   with the thrice Holy One, he "abhorred himself" (42:6). In David's case
   the chastisement was retributive, in Job's corrective.

   ABRAHAM. In him we see an illustration of an entirely different aspect
   of chastening. Most of the trials to which he was subjected were
   neither because of open sins nor for the correction of inward faults.
   Rather were they sent for the development of spiritual graces. Abraham
   was sorely tried in various ways, but it was in order that faith might
   be strengthened and that patience might have its perfect work in him.
   Abraham was weaned from the things of this world, that he might enjoy
   closer fellowship with Jehovah and become the "friend" of God.

   PAUL. "And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance
   of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
   messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure
   (2 Cor. 12:7). This "thorn" was sent not because of failure and sin,
   but as a preventative against pride. Note the "lest" both at the
   beginning and end of the verse. The result of this "thorn" was that the
   beloved apostle was made more conscious of his weakness. Thus,
   chastisement has for one of its main objects the breaking down of
   self-sufficiency, the bringing us to the end of our selves. Now in view
   of these widely different aspects chastenings which are retributive,
   corrective, educative, and preventative, how incompetent are we to
   diagnose, and how great is the folly of pronouncing a judgment
   concerning others! Let us not conclude when we see a fellow-Christian
   under the rod of God that he is necessarily being taken to task for his
   sins. In our next meditation we shall, D.V., consider the spirit in
   which Divine chastisements are to be received.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 8

  Divine Chastisement

   "My Son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou
   art rebuked of Him" (Hebrews 12:5).

   Not all chastisement is sanctified to the recipients of it. Some are
   hardened thereby; others are crushed beneath it. Much depends on the
   spirit in which afflictions are received. There is no virtue in trials
   and troubles in themselves: it is only as they are blest by God that
   the Christian is profited thereby. As Heb. 12:11 informs us, it is
   those who are "exercised" under God's rod that bring forth "the
   peaceable fruit of righteousness." A sensitive conscience and a tender
   heart are the needed adjuncts. In our text the Christian is warned
   against two entirely different dangers: despise not, despair not. These
   are two extremes against which it is ever necessary to keep a sharp
   look-out. Just as every truth of Scripture has its balancing
   counterpart, so has every evil its opposite. On the one hand there is a
   haughty spirit which laughs at the rod, a stubborn will which refuses
   to be humbled thereby. On the other hand, there is a fainting which
   utterly sinks beneath it and gives way to despair. Spurgeon said, "The
   way of righteousness is a difficult pass between two mountains of
   error, and the great secret of the Christian's life is to wind his way
   along the narrow valley."

   I.Despising the Rod. There are a number of ways in which Christians may
   "despise" God's chastenings. We mention four of them:

   1.By callousness. To be stoical is the policy of carnal wisdom- make
   the best of a bad job. The man of the world knows no better plan than
   to grit his teeth and brave things out. Having no Divine Comforter,
   Counsellor or Physician, he has to fall back on his own poor resources.
   It is inexpressibly sad when we see a child of God conducting himself
   as does a child of the Devil. For a Christian to defy adversities is to
   "despise" chastisement. Instead of hardening himself to endure
   stoically, there should be a melting of the heart.

   2. By complaining. This is what the Hebrews did in the wilderness; and
   there are still many mumurers in Israel's camp. A little sickness, and
   we become so cross that our friends are afraid to come near us. A few
   days in bed, and we fret and fume like a bullock unaccustomed to the
   yoke. We peevishly ask, Why this affliction? What have I done to
   deserve it? We look around with envious eyes, and are discontented
   because others are carrying a lighter load. Beware, my reader: it goes
   hard with murmurers. God always chastises twice if we are not humbled
   by the first. Remind yourself of how much dross there yet is among the
   gold. View the corruptions of your own heart, and marvel that God has
   not smitten you twice as severely. "My Son, despise not thou the
   chastening of the Lord."

   3. By criticisms. How often we question the usefulness of chastisement.
   As Christians we seem to have little more spiritual good sense than we
   had natural wisdom as children. As boys we thought that the rod was the
   least necessary thing in the home. It is so with the children of God.
   When things go as we like them, when some unexpected temporal blessing
   is bestowed, we have no difficulty in ascribing all to a kind
   Providence. But when our plans are thwarted, when losses are ours, it
   is very different. Yet, is it not written, "I form the light and create
   darkness. I make; peace and create evil: I the Lord do all these
   things" (Isa. 45:7)? How often is the thing formed ready to complain,
   "Why hast thou made me thus?" We say, I cannot see how this can
   possibly profit my soul. If I had better health I could attend the
   house of prayer more frequently! If I had been spared those losses in
   business I would have more money for the Lord's work! What good can
   possibly come of this calamity? Like Jacob, we exclaim: "All these
   things are against me. What is this but to "despise" the rod? Shall thy
   ignorance challenge God's wisdom? Shall thy shortsightedness arraign
   omniscience?

   4. By carelessness. So many fail to mend their ways. The exhortation of
   our text is much needed by all of us. There are many who have
   "despised" the rod, and in consequence they have not profited thereby.
   Many a Christian has been corrected by God, but in vain. Sickness,
   reverses, bereavements have come, but they have not been sanctified by
   prayerful self-examination. Oh brethren and sisters, take heed. If God
   be chastening thee "consider your ways (Hag. 1:5), "ponder the path of
   thy feet" (Prov. 4:26). Be assured that there is some reason for the
   chastening. Many a Christian would not have been chastised half so
   severely had he diligently inquired the cause of it.

   II . Fainting Under It. Having been warned against "despising" the rod,
   now we are admonished not to give way to despair under it. There are at
   least three ways in which the Christian may "faint" beneath the Lord's
   rebukes:

   1. When he gives up all exertion. This is done when we sink down in
   despondency. The smitten one concludes that it is more than he can
   possibly endure. His heart fails him; darkness swallows him up; the sun
   of hope is eclipsed, and the voice of thanksgiving is silent. To
   "faint" means rendering ourselves unfit for the discharge of our
   duties. When a person faints, he is rendered motionless. How many
   Christians are ready to completely give up the fight when adversity
   enters their life. How many are rendered quite inert when trouble comes
   their way. How many, by their attitude, say, God's hand is heavy upon
   me: I can do nothing. Ah, beloved, "sorrow not, even as others which
   have no hope" ((I Thess. 4:13). "Faint not when thou are rebuked of
   Him." Go to the Lord about it: recognize His hand in it. Remember thine
   afflictions are among the "all things" which work together for good.

   2.When he questions his sonship. There are not a few Christians who,
   when the rod descends upon them, conclude that they are not sons of God
   after all. They forget that it is written "Many are the afflictions of
   the righteous (Psa. 34:19), and that "we must through much tribulation
   enter the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22). One says, "But if I were His
   child I should not be in this poverty, misery, pain." Listen to verse
   8: "But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then
   are ye bastards, and not sons." Learn, then, to look upon trials as
   proofs of God's love purging, pruning, purifying thee. The father of a
   family does not concern himself much about those on the outside of his
   household: it is they who are within whom he guards and guides,
   nurtures and conforms to his will. So it is with God.

   3.When he despairs. Some indulge the fancy that they will never get out
   of their trouble. One says, I have prayed and prayed, but the clouds
   have not lifted. Then comfort yourself with this reflection: It is
   always the darkest hour that precedes the dawn. Therefore, "faint not"
   when thou art rebuked of Him. But, says another, I have pleaded His
   promise, and things are no better. I thought He delivered those who
   called upon Him; I have called, and He has not answered, and I fear He
   never will. What, child of God, speak of thy Father thus! You say He
   will never leave off smiting because He has smitten so long. Rather say
   He has now smitten so long I must soon be delivered. Despise not: faint
   not. May Divine grace preserve both writer and reader from either
   sinful extreme.

CHAPTER 9

  God's Inheritance

   "For the Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
   inheritance" (Deuteronomy 32:9)

   This verse brings before us a most blessed and wonderful line of truth,
   so wonderful that no human mind could possibly have invented it. It
   speaks of the mighty God having an "inheritance," and it tells us that
   this inheritance is in His own people! God refused to take this world
   for His inheritance-it will yet be burnt up. Nor did heaven, peopled
   with angels, satisfy His heart. In eternity past Jehovah said, by way
   of anticipation, "My delights were with the sons of men" (Prov. 8:31).

   This is by no means the only scripture which teaches that God's
   inheritance is in His saints. In Psalm l35:4 we read, "For the Lord
   hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for His peculiar treasure."
   In Mal. 3:17 the Lord speaks of His people as His "special treasure"
   (see margin)-so "special" that the highest manifestations of His love
   are made to them, the richest gifts of His hand are bestowed on them,
   the mansions on High are prepared and reserved for them! The same
   wondrous truth is taught in the New Testament. In Ephesians 1 we behold
   the apostle Paul praying that God would give unto His people the spirit
   of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him: the eyes of their
   understanding being enlightened that they might know "what is the hope
   of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in
   the saints" (v. 18). This is a truly amazing expression; not only do
   the saints obtain an inheritance in God, but He also secures an
   inheritance in them! How overwhelming the thought that the great God
   should deem Himself the richer because of our faith, our love and
   worship! Surely this is one of the most marvellous truths revealed in
   Holy Writ-that God should pick up poor sinners and make them His
   "inheritance"! Yet so it is.

   But what need has God of us? How can we possibly enrich Him? Does He
   not have everything-wisdom, power, grace and glory? All true, yet there
   is something that He needs, yes, needs, namely, vessels. Just as the
   sun needs the earth to shine upon, so God needs vessels to fill,
   vessels through which His glory may be reflected, vessels on which the
   riches of His grace may be lavished. Mark that God's people are not
   only called His "portion," His "special treasure, but also His
   "inheritance. ' This suggests three things. First, an "inheritance is
   obtained through death: so God's inheritance is secured to Him through
   the death of His beloved Son. Second, an "inheritance" denotes
   perpetuity-"to a man and his heirs forever" are the terms often used.
   Third, an "inheritance" is for possession, it is something which is
   entered into, lived upon, enjoyed. Let us now consider five things
   about God's inheritance:

   1.God purposed to have such an inheritance: "Blessed is the nation
   whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own
   inheritance" (Psa. 33:12). The "nation" here is identical with the holy
   nation," the "chosen generation, royal priesthood, peculiar people" of
   I Peter 2:9. This favoured people was chosen by God to be His
   inheritance: it was not an afterthought with Him, but decreed by Him in
   eternity past. Ere the foundation of the world God fixed His heart upon
   having them for Himself.

   2.God has purchased His people for an inheritance. In Ephesians 1:14 we
   are told that the Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance until
   the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His
   glory." So again in Acts 20:28 we read of "the Church of God which He
   hath purchased with His own blood." God has not only redeemed His
   people from bondage and death but for Himself.

   3.God comes and dwells in the midst of His inheritance: "For the Lord
   will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance"
   (Psa. 94:14) -a clear proof that these scriptures are not referring to
   the nation of Israel after the flesh. Just as Jehovah tabernacled in
   the midst of the redeemed Hebrews, so He now indwells His church, both
   collectively and individually. "Know ye not that ye (plural) are the
   temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" (I Cor.
   3:16). "Know ye not that your body (singular) is the temple of the Holy
   Spirit?" (I Cor. 6:19).

   4.God beautifies His inheritance: Just as a man who has inherited a
   house or an estate takes possession of it and then makes improvements,
   so God is now fitting His people for Himself. He who has begun a good
   work within His own is now performing it until the day of Jesus Christ
   (Phil. 1:6). He is now conforming us to the image of His Son: each
   Christian can say with the Psalmist, "the Lord will perfect that which
   concerneth me" (Psa. 138:8). Nor will God be satisfied until we have
   been glorified. The Lord Jesus Christ "shall change our vile body, that
   it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the
   working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself"
   (Phil. 3:21). "When he shall appear, we shall be like him" (I John
   3:2).

   5. And what of the future? God will yet possess, live upon, enjoy His
   inheritance. In the unending ages yet to be, God will make known the
   "riches of his glory" on the vessels of His mercy (Rom. 9:23). The
   glory which God shall ever live upon-as upon an inheritance-shall rise
   out of His people. What a marvellous statement is that which is found
   at the close of Ephesians 2, where the saints are likened unto a
   building "fitly framed together (which) 36 groweth unto an holy temple
   in the Lord," of whom it is said, "in whom ye also are builded together
   for an habitation of God through the Spirit." Wonderful and glorious is
   the picture presented before us in Rev. 21: "And I saw a new heaven and
   a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away;
   and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, the new
   Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
   adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven
   saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will rest in
   his love, he will joy over thee with singing; and God himself shall be
   with them, and be their God" (vv. 1-3).

   What a marvellous statement is that in Zephaniah 3:17: "The Lord thy
   God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over
   thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with
   singing." The great God will yet say, "I am satisfied: here will I
   rest. This is Mine inheritance that I will live upon forever, even the
   glory which I have bestowed on redeemed sinners." Surely we have to say
   with the Psalmist, "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high,
   I cannot attain unto it" (139:6). May Divine grace enable us to walk
   worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called.

CHAPTER 10

  God Securing His Inheritance

   "He found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness; he
   led him about. He instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye"
   (Deuteronomy 32:10).

   In the previous verse we have the amazing statement that the Lord's
   "portion" is His people, and that there may be no misunderstanding, the
   same truth is expressed in another form: "Jacob is the lot of his
   inheritance." Here in our text we learn something of the pains which
   God takes to secure His heritage. There are four things to be noted and
   feasted upon.

   1.Jehovah Finding His people. "He found him in a desert land." It needs
   hardly to be said that the word "found" necessarily implies a "search."
   Here then we have presented to our view the amazing spectacle of a
   seeking God! Sin came in between the creature and the Creator, causing
   alienation and separation. Not only so, but, as the result of the Fall,
   every human being enters this world with a mind that is "enmity against
   God." Consequently, there is none that seeketh after God. Therefore,
   God, in His marvellous condescension and grace, becomes the Seeker. The
   word "found" not only implies a search but, when we consider the sinful
   character and unworthiness of the objects of His search, it also tells
   of the love of the Seeker. The great God becomes the Seeker because He
   set His heart upon those whom He marked out to be the recipients of His
   sovereign favours. God had set His heart upon Abraham, and therefore
   did He seek and find him amid the heathen idolators in Ur of Chaldea.
   God set His heart upon Jacob, and therefore did He seek out and find
   him as a fugitive from his brother's vengeance, when he lay asleep on
   the bare earth. So too it was because He had loved Moses with an
   everlasting love that the Lord sought out and found him in Midian, at
   "the backside of the desert." Equally true is this with every real
   Christian living in the world today: "I was found of them that sought
   me not; I was manifest unto them that asked not after me (Rom. 10:20).
   Has God "found" you? To help you answer this question, ponder the
   remainder of the first clause of our text: "He found him in a desert
   land, and in the waste howling wilderness." Is that how this world
   appears unto you? Do you find everything under the sun only "vanity and
   vexation of spirit"? Are you made to groan daily at what you witness on
   every hand? Do you find that the world furnishes nothing to satisfy the
   heart, yea nothing to even minister to it? Is the world, really, a
   "waste howling wilderness" to you? Let a second test be applied: when
   God truly "finds" one of His own He reveals Himself. He imparts to the
   soul a realization of His sovereign majesty, His awe-some power, His
   ineffable holiness, His wondrous mercy. Has He thus made Himself known
   unto you? Has He given you, in any measure, a vision of His Divine
   glory, His sovereign grace, His wondrous love? Has He? "This is life
   eternal, that they might know Thee, the One true God, and Jesus Christ,
   whom Thou hast sent" (John 17:3). Here is a third test: If God has
   revealed Himself, He has given you a sight of yourself, for in His
   light we "see light." A most humbling, painful, and
   never-to-be-forgotten experience this is. When God was revealed to
   Abraham, he said, "I am but dust and ashes" (Gen. 18:27). When He was
   revealed to Isaiah, the prophet said, "Woe is me for I am undone,
   because I am a man of unclean lips" (Isa. 6:5). When God revealed
   Him-self to Job, he said, "I abhor myself, and repent in dust and
   ashes" (Job 42:6)-note, not merely I abhor my wicked ways, but my vile
   self. Is this your experience, my reader? Have you discovered your
   depravity and lost condition? Have you found there is not a single good
   thing in you? Have you seen yourself to be fit for and deserving only
   of hell? Have you, truly? Then that is good evidence, yea, it is proof
   positive that the Lord God has "found" you.

   2. Jehovah Leading His People. "He led him about." The "finding" is not
   the end, but only the beginning of God's dealings with His own. Having
   found him, He remains never more to leave him. Now that He has found
   His wandering child He teaches him to walk in the Narrow Way. There is
   a beautiful word on God "leading" in Hosea 11:3: "I taught Ephraim also
   to go, taking them by their arms. Just as a fond mother takes her
   little one, whose feet are yet too weak and untrained to walk alone, so
   the Lord takes His people by their arms and leads them in the paths of
   righteousness for His name's sake. Such is His promise: "He will keep
   the feet of His saints" (1 Sam. 2:9). There is a threefold "leading" of
   the Lord: Evangelical.-The Lord Jesus declared, "I am the way, the
   truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by Me" (John
   14:6). But again He said, 'No man can come to Me, except the Father
   which hath sent Me draw him" John 6:44). Here then is how God leads: He
   leads the poor sinner to Christ. Have you, my reader, been brought to
   the Saviour? Is Christ your only hope? Are you trusting in the
   sufficiency of His precious blood? If so, what cause have you to praise
   God for having led you to His blessed Son! Doctrinal.-The Lord Jesus
   declared, "When He the Spirit of truth is come, He will guide you into
   all the truth" John 16:13). We are not capable of discovering or
   entering into the Truth of ourselves, therefore do we have to be guided
   into it. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
   God." (Rom. 8:14). It is He who makes us to lie down in the "green
   pastures of Scripture and who leads us beside the "still waters" of His
   promises. How thankful we ought to be for every ray of light which has
   been granted us from the lamp of God's Word. Providential.-"Thou in thy
   manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of
   the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way;
   neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way
   wherein they should go" (Neh. 9:19). Just as Jehovah led Israel of old,
   so today He leads us step by step through this wilderness-world. What a
   mercy this is. "The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he
   delighteth in his way" (Psa. 37:23). Yes, every detail of our lives is
   regulated by the Most High.

   All my times are in Thy hand, All events at Thy command, All must come
   and last and end, As doth please our Heavenly Friend.

   3. God Instructing His People. "He instructed him." So He does us. It
   was to instruct us that God, in His great mercy, gave us the
   Scriptures. He has not left us to grope our way in darkness, but has
   provided us with a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path. Nor
   are we left to our own unaided powers in the study of the Word. We are
   supplied with an infallible Instructor. The Holy Spirit is our teacher,
   "Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things . . . the
   anointing ye have received of Him abideth in you, and ye need not that
   any man teach you" (I John 2:20, 27). Right views of God's truth are
   not an intellectual attainment, but a blessing bestowed upon us by God.
   It is written, "a man can receive nothing, except it be given him from
   heaven" (John 3:27). No matter how legibly a letter may be written, if
   the recipient be blind he cannot read it. So we are told, "the natural
   man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
   foolishness unto him: neither can he know them because they are
   spiritually discerned" (I Cor. 2:14). And spiritual discernment is
   imparted only by the Holy Spirit. "He instructed him." How patiently
   God bears with our dullness! How graciously He repeats "line upon line
   and precept upon precept"! Yet slow as we are, He perseveres with us,
   for He has promised to perfect that which concerns us (Psa. 138:8). Has
   He "instructed" you, my reader? Has He taught you the total depravity
   of man and the utter inability of the sinner to deliver himself? Has He
   taught you the humbling truth "Ye must be born again," and that
   regeneration is the sole work of God-man having no part or hand in it
   (John 1:13). Has He revealed to you the infinite value and sufficiency
   of the atoning sacrifice of Christ, that His blood cleanses "from all
   sin"? Then what cause you have to be thankful for such Divine
   instruction.

   4. God Preserving His People. "He kept him as the apple of his eye." A
   religion of conditions, contingencies, and uncertainties is not
   Christianity-its technical name is Arminianism, and Arminianism is a
   daughter of Rome. It is that God dishonouring, Scripture-repudiating,
   soul-destroying system of Popery-whose father is the Devil-which prates
   about human merit, creature-ability, works of supererogation and a lot
   more blasphemous rubbish, and leaves its blinded dupes in the fogs and
   bogs of uncertainty. Christianity deals with certainties which
   originated in the purpose and love of an unchanging God, who when He
   begins a good work always completes it. "For the Lord loveth judgment,
   and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved forever (Psa. 37:28).
   How blessed is this! Did Jehovah "forsake" Noah when he got drunk? No,
   indeed. Did He "forsake" Abraham when he lied to Abimelech? No, indeed.
   Did He "forsake" Moses for smiting the rock in anger? No, indeed, as
   His appearance on the Mount of Transfiguration abundantly proves. Did
   He "forsake" David when he committed those sins which ever since have
   given occasion for the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme? No, indeed. He
   led him to repentance, caused him to confess his awful wickedness, and
   then sent one of His servants to say, "The Lord hath put away thy sin."
   "The Lord is thy Keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The
   sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall
   preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall
   preserve thy going out and thy coming in from 'this time forth and even
   for evermore" (Psa. 121:5-8). Here are the covenant verities of our
   faithful God: here are the infallible "shall's" of the triune Jehovah:
   here are the sure promises of Him who cannot lie. Note there were no
   "if's" or preadventure's, but the unconditional and unqualified
   declarations of the Most High. No circumstances can ever place the
   believer beyond the reach of Divine preservation. No change can alter
   or affect this Divine certainty. Wealth may ensnare, poverty may strip,
   Satan may tempt, inward corruptions may annoy, but nothing can ever
   destroy or lead to the destruction of a single sheep of Christ; nay,
   all these things only serve to display more manifestly and more
   gloriously the preserving hand of our God. We "are kept by the power of
   God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time"
   (1 Peter 1:5). The rage of heathen monarchs, with their den of lions
   and fiery furnace, may be employed to try the faith of God's elect, but
   destroy them, harm them, they cannot. Oh brethren in Christ, what cause
   we have to praise the finding, instructing, and preserving, Triune
   Jehovah!
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 11

  Mourning

   "Blessed are they that mourn" (Matthew 5:4).

   Mourning is hateful and irksome to poor human nature. From suffering
   and sadness our spirits instinctively shrink. By nature we seek the
   society of the cheerful and joyous. Our text presents an anomaly to the
   unregenerate, yet is it sweet music to the ears of God's elect. If
   "blessed" why do they "mourn"? If they "mourn" how can they be
   "blessed"? Only the child of God has the key to this paradox. The more
   we ponder our text the more we are constrained to exclaim, never man
   spake like this Man!" "Blessed (happy) are they that mourn" is at
   complete variance with the world's logic. Men have in all places and in
   all ages, deemed the prosperous and the gay the happy ones, but Christ
   pronounces happy those who are poor in spirit and who mourn. Now it is
   obvious that it is not every species of mourning that is here referred
   to. There is a "sorrow of the world which worketh death." The mourning
   to which Christ promises comfort must be restricted to that which is
   spiritual. The mourning which is blessed is the result of a realization
   of God's holiness and goodness which issues in a sense of our own
   wickedness-the depravity of our natures, the enormity and guilt of our
   conduct and the sorrowing over our sins with a godly sorrow. We
   intimated in our last that the eight Beatitudes are arranged in four
   pairs; proof of this will be furnished as we proceed. The first of the
   series is the blessing which Christ pronounced upon those who are poor
   in spirit, which we took to mean, they who have been awakened to a
   sense of their own nothingness and emptiness. Now the transition from
   such poverty to mourning is easy to follow, in fact, it follows so
   closely that it is rather its companion.

   The mourning which is here referred to is manifestly more than that of
   bereavement, affliction or loss. It is mourning for sin. 'It is
   mourning over the felt destitution of our spiritual state, and over the
   iniquities that have separated between us and God; mourning over the
   very morality in which we have boasted, and the self-righteousness in
   which we have trusted; sorrow for rebellion against God, and hostility
   to His will; and such mourning always goes side by side with conscious
   poverty of spirit" (Dr. Person).

   A striking illustration and exemplification of the spirit upon which
   the Saviour here pronounced His benediction is to be found in Luke 18.
   There a vivid contrast is presented to our view. First, we are shown a
   self-righteous Pharisee looking up toward God and saying, "God, I thank
   Thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
   or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of
   all that I possess." This may have been all true as he looked at it,
   yet this man went down to his house in a state of condemnation. His
   fine garments were rags, his white robes were filthy, though he knew it
   not. Then we are shown the publican, standing afar off, who, in the
   language of the Psalmist was so troubled by his iniquities that he was
   not able to look up (Psa. 40:12). He dared not so much as lift up his
   eyes to Heaven, but smote upon his breast, conscious of the fountain of
   corruption within, and cried, "God be merciful to me a sinner," and
   that man went down to his house justified, because he was poor in
   spirit and mourned for sin.

   Here then are the first birth-marks of the children of God, and he who
   has never come to be poor in spirit, and has never known what it is to
   really mourn for sin, though he belong to a church and be an
   office-bearer in it, has neither entered nor seen the kingdom of God.
   How thankful the Christian reader ought to be that the great God
   condescends to dwell in the humble and contrite heart! Where can we
   find anything in all the Old Testament more precious than that?-that
   He, in whose sight the heavens are not clean, who cannot find in any
   temple that man ever builded for Him, however magnificent, a proper
   dwelling place, has said Isa. 66:2 and Isa. 57:15! "Blessed are they
   that mourn. Though the primary reference be to that initial mourning,
   usually termed 'conviction of sin,'' it is by no means to be limited to
   this.

   Mourning is ever a characteristic of the normal Christian state. There
   is much that the believer has to mourn over-the plague of his own heart
   makes him cry, Oh wretched man that I am"; the unbelief which "doth so
   easily beset us" and the sins which we commit that are more in number
   than the hairs of our head, are a continual grief; the barrenness and
   unprofitableness of our lives make us sigh and cry; our propensity to
   wander from Christ, our lack of communion with Him, the shallowness of
   our love for Him, cause us to hang our harps upon the willows.


   But this is not all. The hypocritical religion prevailing on every
   hand, having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof; the
   awful dishonour done to the truth of God by the false doctrines taught
   in countless pulpits; the divisions among the Lord's people, the strife
   between brethren, occasion continual sorrow of heart. The awful
   wickedness in the world, men despising Christ, the untold sufferings
   around, make us groan within ourselves. The closer the Christian lives
   to God, the more will he mourn over all that dishonours Him. With the
   Psalmist he will say: 119:53; with Jeremiah, 13:17; 14:17; with
   Ezekiel, 9:4.

   "They shall be comforted." This refers first of all to the removal of
   the conscious guilt which burdens the conscience. It finds its
   fulfillment in the Spirit's application of the Gospel of God's grace to
   the one whom He has convicted of his dire need of a Saviour. It issues
   in a sense of free and full forgiveness through the merits of the
   atoning blood of Christ. This Divine comfort is the peace of God which
   passeth all understanding filling the heart of the one who is now
   assured that he is "accepted in the Beloved." God wounds before
   healing, abases before He exalts. First there is a revelation of His
   justice and holiness, then the making known of His mercy and grace.

   "They shall be comforted" also receives a constant fulfillment in the
   experience of the Christian. Though he mourns his excuseless failures
   and confesses them to God, yet he is comforted by the assurance that
   the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses him from all sin. Though he
   groans over the dishonour done to God on every side, yet is he
   comforted by the knowledge that the day is rapidly approaching when
   Satan shall be removed from these scenes and when the Lord Jesus shall
   sit upon the throne of His glory and rule in righteousness and peace.
   Though the chastening hand of the Lord is often laid upon him and
   though "no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
   grievous," nevertheless, he is consoled by the realization that this is
   all working out for him "a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
   glory." Like the Apostle, the believer who is in communion with his
   Lord can say, "As sorrowful yet always rejoicing." He may often be
   called upon to drink of the bitter waters of Marah, but God has planted
   nearby a tree to sweeten them. Yes "mourning" Christians are comforted
   even now by the Divine Comforter, by the ministrations of His servants,
   by encouraging words from fellow Christians, and when these are not to
   hand, by the precious promises of the Word being brought home in power
   to his memory and heart.

   "They shall be comforted." The best wine is reserved for the last.
   Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. During
   the long night of His absence, the saints of God have been called to
   fellowship with Him who was the Man of Sorrows. But, blessed be God, it
   is written, "If we suffer with Him we shall also be glorified
   together." What comfort and joy will be ours when shall dawn the
   morning without clouds! Then shall "sorrow and sighing flee away" (Isa.
   35:10). Then shall be fulfilled the saying-Rev. 21:3- 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 12

  Hungering

   "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for
   they shall be filled"(Matthew 5:6).

   In the first three Beatitudes we are called upon to witness the heart
   exercises of one who has been awakened by the Spirit of God. First,
   there is a sense of need, a realization of my nothingness and
   emptiness. Second, there is a judging of self, a consciousness of my
   guilt and sorrowing over my lost condition. Third, there is an end of
   seeking to justify myself before God, an abandonment of all pretences
   to personal merit, a taking of my place in the dust before God. Here,
   in the fourth, the eye of the soul is turned away from self to Another:
   there is a longing after that which I know I have not got and which I
   am conscious I urgently need. There has been much needless quibbling as
   to the precise import of the word "righteousness" in our present text.
   The best way to ascertain its significance is to go back to the Old
   Testament scriptures where this term is used, and then turn on these
   the fuller light furnished by the New Testament Epistles. "Drop down,
   ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let
   the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let
   righteousness spring up together; I, the Lord have created it" (Isa.
   45:8). The first half of this verse refers, in figurative language, to
   the advent of Christ to this earth; the second half to His
   resurrection, when He was "raised again for our justification." Hearken
   unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness: I bring near
   my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not
   tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory" (Isa.
   46:12-14). "My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and
   mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on
   mine arms shall they trust" (Isa. 51:5). "Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye
   judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my
   righteousness to be revealed" (Isa. 56:1). "I will greatly rejoice in
   the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me
   with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of
   righteousness" (Isa. 61:10). These passages make it clear that God's
   "righteousness" is synonymous with God's "salvation." The above
   scriptures are unfolded in the Epistle to the Romans where the "Gospel"
   receives its fullest exposition, see 1:1. In 1:16, 17, we are told "I
   am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto
   salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to
   the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith
   to faith." In 3:22, 24 we read, "Even the righteousness of God which is
   by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe, for
   there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the
   glory of God; Being justified freely by His grace through the
   redemption that is in Christ Jesus." In 5:19 the blessed declaration is
   made, "for as by one man's disobedience many were made (legally
   constituted) sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made
   (legally constituted) righteous." While in 10:4 we learn, "Christ is
   the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." The
   sinner is destitute of righteousness, for "there is none righteous, no
   not one." God has therefore provided in Christ a perfect righteousness
   for each and all of His people. This righteousness, this satisfying of
   all the demands of God's holy law against us, was wrought out by our
   Substitute and Surety. This righteousness is now imputed-legally placed
   to the account of the believing sinner. Just as the sins of God's
   people were all transferred to Christ, so His righteousness is placed
   upon them, see 2 Cor. 5:21. Such is a brief summary of the teaching of
   Scripture on this vital and blessed subject of "Righteousness."
   "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness."
   Hungering and thirsting express vehement desire, of which the soul is
   acutely conscious. First, the Holy Spirit brings before the heart the
   holy requirements of God. He reveals to us His perfect standard, which
   He can never lower. He reminds us that "Except your righteousness
   exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no
   case enter the kingdom of heaven." Second, the trembling soul,
   conscious of its own abject poverty, realizing his utter inability to
   measure up to God's requirements, sees no help in self. This is a
   painful discovery, which causes him to mourn and groan. Have you done
   so? Third, the Holy Spirit now creates in the heart a deep "hunger and
   thirst," which causes the convicted sinner to look for relief and seek
   a supply outside of himself. The eye is now directed to Christ, "The
   Lord our Righteousness" (Jer. 23:6). Like the previous ones, this
   attitude begins in the unconverted, but is perpetuated in the saved
   sinner. There is a repeated exercise of this grace, felt at varying
   intervals. The one who longed to be saved by Christ now yearns to be
   made like Him. Looked at in its widest aspect, this hungering and
   thirsting refers to that panting of the renewed heart after God (Psa.
   42:1), that yearning for a closer walk with Him, that longing for more
   perfect conformity to the image of His Son. It tells of those
   Inspirations of the new nature for Divine blessing which alone can
   strengthen, sustain and satisfy. Our text presents such a paradox that
   it is evident no carnal mind ever invented it. Can one who has been
   brought into vital union with Him who is the Bread of Life, and in whom
   all fullness dwells, be found still hungering and thirsting? Yes, such
   is the experience of the renewed heart. Mark carefully the tense of the
   verb: it is not "Blessed are they which have," but "Blessed are they
   which do hunger and thirst." Do you, dear reader? Or are you content
   with your attainments and satisfied with your condition? Hungering and
   thirsting after righteousness has ever been the experience of God's
   saints: see Psalm 82:4; Phil. 3:8, 14, etc. "They shall be filled."
   Like the first part of our text, this also has a double fulfillment-an
   initial and a continuous. When God creates a hunger and a thirst in the
   soul it is that He may satisfy them. When the poor sinner is made to
   feel his need of Christ, it is that he may be drawn to and led to
   embrace Him. Like the prodigal, who came to the Father as a penitent,
   the believing sinner now feeds on the One figured by the "fatted calf."
   He is made to exclaim "surely in the Lord have I righteousness." "They
   shall be filled." Not with wine wherein is excess, but "filled with the
   Spirit." "Filled" with "the peace of God that passeth all
   understanding." "Filled" with Divine blessing to which no sorrow is
   added. "Filled" with praise and thanksgiving unto Him who has wrought
   all our works in us. "Filled" with that which this poor world can
   neither give nor take away. "Filled" by the goodness and mercy of God,
   till their cup runneth over. And yet, all that is enjoyed now is but a
   little foretaste of what God has prepared for them that love Him. In
   the Day to come we shall be "filled" with Divine holiness, for we shall
   be "like him" (I John 3:2). Then shall we be done with sin forever;
   then shall we "hunger no more, neither thirst anymore" (Rev. 7:16).

CHAPTER 13

  Heart Purity

   "Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8).

   This is another of the Beatitudes which has been grossly perverted by
   the enemies of the Lord; enemies who have, like their predecessors the
   Pharisees, posed as the champions of the truth and boasted of a
   superior sanctity to that confessed by the true people of God. All
   through this Christian era there have been poor deluded souls who have
   claimed an entire purification of the old man, or who have insisted
   that God has so completely renewed them that the carnal nature has been
   eradicated, and in consequence that they not only commit no sins but
   have no sinful desires or thoughts. But God tells us: "If we say we
   have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (I John
   1 18). Of course such people appeal to the Scriptures in support of
   their vain delusion, applying to experience verses which describe the
   legal benefits of the Atonement. "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son
   cleanseth us from all sin" does not mean that our hearts have been
   washed from the corrupting defilements of evil, but that the sacrifice
   of Christ has availed for the judicial blotting out of sins. "Old
   things are passed away; behold, all things are become new" (2 Cor.
   5:17) refers not to our state in this world, but to the Christian's
   standing before God. That purity of heart does not mean sinlessness of
   life is clear from the inspired record of the history of all of God's
   saints. Noah got drunk; Abraham equivocated; Moses disobeyed God; Job
   cursed the day of his birth; Elijah fled in terror from Jezebel; Peter
   denied Christ. Yes, perhaps someone will exclaim, But all these were
   before Christianity was established. True, but it has also been the
   same since then. Where shall we go to find a Christian of superior
   attainment to those of the apostle Paul? And what was his experience?
   Read Romans 7 and see. When he would do good, evil was present with him
   (v. 21); there was a law in his members warring against the law of his
   mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin (v. 23). He
   did, with the mind, serve the law of God; nevertheless, with the flesh
   he served the law of sin (v. 25). Ah, Christian reader, the truth is
   that one of the most conclusive evidences that we do possess a pure
   heart is the discovery and consciousness of the impurity of the old
   heart dwelling side by side within. But let us come closer to our text.
   "Blessed are the pure in heart." In seeking an interpretation to any
   part of this Sermon on the Mount the first thing to bear in mind is
   that those whom our Lord was addressing had been reared in Judaism. As
   said one who was deeply taught of the Spirit: "I cannot help thinking
   that our Lord, in using the terms before us, had a tacit reference to
   that character of external sanctity or purity which belonged to the
   Jewish people, and to that privilege of intercourse with God which was
   connected with that character. They were a people separated from the
   nations polluted with idolatry; set apart as holy to Jehovah; and, as a
   holy people, they were permitted to draw near to their God, the only
   living and true God, in the ordinances of His worship". On the
   possession of this character, and on the enjoyment of this privilege,
   the Jewish people plumed themselves. "A higher character, however, and
   a higher privilege, belonged to those who should be the subjects of the
   Messiah's reign. They should not only be externally holy, but, 'pure in
   heart'; and they should not merely be allowed to approach towards the
   holy place, where God's honour dwelt, but they should 'see God,' be
   introduced into the most intimate intercourse with Him. Thus viewed, as
   a description of the spiritual character and privileges of the subjects
   of the Messiah, in contrast with the external character and privileges
   of the Jewish people, the passage before us is full of the most
   important and interesting truth." (Dr. John Brown). "Blessed are the
   pure in heart." Opinion is divided as to whether these words of Christ
   are to be understood literally or figuratively; whether the reference
   be to the new heart itself received at regeneration, or to the moral
   transformation of character which results from a Divine work of grace
   being wrought in the soul. Probably both aspects of the truth are
   combined here. In view of the late place which this Beatitude occupies
   in the series, it would appear that the purity of heart upon which our
   Saviour pronounced His blessing, is that internal cleansing which
   accompanies and follows the new birth. Yet, inasmuch as no heart purity
   exists in the natural man, what is here affirmed by Christ must be
   traced back to regeneration itself. The Psalmist said, "Behold Thou
   desirest truth in the inward parts; and in the hidden part Thou shalt
   make me to know wisdom" (Psa. 51:6). How far this goes beneath the
   outward renovation and reformation which comprises such a large part of
   the efforts now being put forth in Christendom! Much that we see around
   us is a hand religion-seeking salvation by works-or a head religion,
   which rests satisfied with an orthodox creed. But God looketh on the
   heart-an expression which appears to include the understanding, the
   affections and the will. It is because God looketh within that He gives
   a "new heart" (Ezek. 36:26) to His own people, and "blessed" indeed are
   they who have received such, for it is a "pure heart." As intimated
   above, we believe this sixth Beatitude contemplates both the new heart
   received at regeneration and the transformation of character which
   follows God's work of grace in the soul. First, there is a "washing of
   regeneration" (Titus 3:5) by which we understand a cleansing of the
   affections, which are now set upon things above, instead of things
   below; this is parallel with "purifying their hearts by faith" (Acts
   15:9). Accompanying this is the cleansing of the conscious-"having our
   hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience" (Heb. 10:22), which refers to
   the removal of the burden of conscious guilt, the inward realization
   that being justified by faith we "have peace with God." But the purity
   of heart commended here by Christ goes further than this. What is
   purity? Freedom from defilement, undivided affections, sincerity and
   genuineness. As a quality of Christian character, we would define it as
   godly simplicity. It is the opposite of subtlety and duplicity. Genuine
   Christianity lays aside not only malice, but guile and hypocrisy. It is
   not enough to be pure in words and in outward deportment; purity of
   desires, motives, intents, are what should, and do in the main,
   characterize the child of God. Here then is a most important test for
   every professing Christian to apply to himself: Are my affections set
   upon things above? Are my motives pure? Why do I assemble with the
   Lord's people?-to be seen of men, or to meet with the Lord and enjoy
   sweet communion with Him? "For they shall see God." Once more we would
   point out how that the promises attached to these Beatitudes have both
   a present and a future fulfillment. The pure in heart possess spiritual
   discernment and with the eyes of their understanding they obtain clear
   views of the Divine character and perceive the excellency of His
   attributes. When the eye is single the whole body is full of light. In
   the truth, the faith of which purifies the heart, they 'see God'; for
   what is that truth but a manifestation of the glory of God in the face
   of Jesus Christ-an illustrious display of the combined radiance of
   Divine holiness and Divine benignity! And he not only obtains clear and
   satisfactory views of the Divine character, but he enjoys intimate and
   delightful communion with God. He is brought very near God; God's mind
   becomes his mind; God's will becomes his will; and his fellowship is
   truly with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. "They who are pure
   in heart 'see God' in this way, even in the present world; and in the
   future state their knowledge of God will become far more extensive and
   their fellowship with Him far more intimate; for though, when compared
   with the privileges of a former dispensation, even now 'as with open
   face we behold the glory of the Lord,' yet, in reference to the
   privileges of a higher economy, we yet see but 'through a glass
   darkly'-we 'know but in part'-we understand but in part, we enjoy but
   in part. But 'that which is in the part shall be done away,' and 'that
   which is perfect shall come.' We shall yet see face to face and know
   even as we are known (I Cor. 13:9-12); or to borrow the words of the
   Psalmist, we 'shall behold his face in righteousness, and shall be
   satisfied when we awake in his likeness' (Psa. 17:15). Then, and not
   till then, will the full meaning of these words be understood 'the pure
   in heart shall see God.'" (Dr. John Brown).

CHAPTER 14

  The Beatitudes and Christ

   Our meditations upon the Beatitudes would not be complete unless they
   turned our thoughts to the person of our blessed Lord. As we have
   endeavored to show, they describe the character and conduct of a
   Christian, and as Christian character is nothing more or less than
   being experimentally conformed to the image of God's Son we must turn
   to Him for the perfect pattern. In the Lord Jesus Christ we find the
   brightest manifestations of the highest exemplifications of the
   different spiritual graces which are found, dimly reflected, in His
   followers. Not one or two but all of these perfections were displayed
   by Him, for Me is not only "lovely," but "altogether lovely." May the
   Holy Spirit who is here to glorify Him take now of the things of Christ
   and show them unto us. First, "Blessed are the poor in spirit." Most
   blessed is it to see how the Scriptures speak of Him who was rich
   becoming poor for our sakes, that we through His poverty might be rich.
   Great indeed was the poverty into which He entered. Born of parents who
   were poor in this world's goods, He commenced His earthly life in a
   manger. During His youth and early manhood He toiled at the carpenter's
   bench. After His public ministry had begun He declared that though the
   foxes had their holes and the birds of the air their nests, the Son of
   Man had not where to lay His head. If we trace out the Messianic
   utterances recorded in the Psalms by the Spirit of prophecy, we shall
   find that again and again He confessed to God His poverty of spirit: "I
   am poor and sorrowful" (Psa. 69:29); and, "Bow down thine ear, Oh
   Jehovah, for I am poor and needy" (Psa. 86:1); and again, "For I am
   poor and needy, and My heart is wounded within me" (Psa. 109:22).
   "Blessed are they that mourn. Christ was indeed the chief Mourner. Old
   Testament prophecy contemplated Him as "the Man of Sorrows and
   acquainted with grief." See Him "grieved for the hardness of their
   hearts" (Mark 3:5) Behold Him "sighing" ere He healed the deaf and dumb
   man (Mark 7:34). Mark Him weeping by the graveside of Lazarus. Hear His
   lamentation over the beloved city, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem . . . how
   often would I have gathered thy children together" (Matt. 23:37). Draw
   near and reverently behold Him in the gloom of Gethsemane, pouring out
   His petitions to the Father "with strong crying and tears" (Heb. 5:7).
   Bow in worshipful wonderment as you hear Him crying from the cross, 'My
   God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" Hearken to His plaintive plea,
   "Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be
   any sorrow like unto My sorrow" (Lam. 1:12). Third, "Blessed are the
   meek." A score of examples might be drawn from the Gospels illustrating
   the lovely lowliness of the incarnate Lord of glory. Mark it in the men
   selected by Him to be His ambassadors: He chose not the wise, the
   learned, the great, the noble, but poor fishermen for the most part.
   Witness it in the company which He kept: He sought not the rich and
   renowned, but was "the Friend of publicans and sinners." See it in the
   miracles which He wrought: again and again He enjoined the healed to go
   and tell no man what had been done for them. Behold it in the
   unobtrusiveness of His service: unlike the hypocrites who sounded a
   trumpet before them, He sought not the lime-light, shunned advertising,
   and disdained popularity. When the crowds would make Him their Idol, He
   avoided them (Mark 1:45; 7:17). When they would come and "Take Him by
   force to make Him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself
   alone" (John 6:15). When His brethren urged, "Show Thyself to the
   world," He declined, and went up to the feast in secret (John 7) . When
   He, in fulfillment of prophecy, presented Himself to Israel, as their
   King, He entered Jerusalem "lowly, and riding upon an ass" (Zech. 9:9).
   Fourth, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
   righteousness.'' What a summary is this of the inner life of the Man
   Christ Jesus! Before the Incarnation, the Holy Spirit announced,
   "Righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins" (Isa. 4:5). When He
   entered this world, He said, "Lo, I come to do Thy will, Oh God" (Heb.
   10:17). As a Boy of twelve He asked, "Wist ye not that I must be about
   My Father's business?" (Luke 2:41). At the beginning of His public
   ministry He declared, "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or
   the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill" (Matt. 5:17).
   To His disciples He declared, "My meat is to do the will of him that
   sent me (John 4:34). Of Him the Holy Spirit has said, "Thou lovest
   righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, Thy God, hath
   anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows" (Psa. 45:7).
   Well may He be called "The Lord our righteousness." Fifth, "Blessed are
   the merciful." In Christ we see mercy personified. It was mercy to poor
   lost sinners which caused the Son of God to exchange the glory of
   Heaven for the shame of earth. It was mercy, wondrous and matchless,
   which took Him to the Cross, there to be made a curse for His people.
   So it is "not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
   according to his mercy he saved us" (Titus 3:5). He still exercises
   mercy to us as our "merciful and faithful High Priest" (Heb. 2:17). So
   also we are to be "looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto
   eternal life" (Jude 21), because He will show us mercy in "that Day" (2
   Tim. 1:18). Sixth, "Blessed are the pure in heart." This too was
   perfectly exemplified in Christ. He was the Lamb "without spot and
   without blemish. In becoming Man, He was uncontaminated, contracting
   none of the defilement's of sin. His humanity was "holy" (Luke 1:35).
   He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners" (Heb. 7:26).
   "In him was no sin" (I John 3:5), therefore He "did no sin" (I Peter
   2:22) and "knew no sin" (2 Cor. 5:21). "He is pure" (I John 3:3).
   Because He was absolutely pure in nature, His motives and actions were
   always pure. "I seek not Mine own glory" (John 8:50) sums up the whole
   of His earthly career. Seventh, "Blessed are the peacemakers."
   Supremely true is this of our blessed Saviour. He is the One who "made
   peace through the blood of his cross" (Col. 1:20). He was appointed to
   be "a propitiation" (Rom. 3:25), that is, the One who should pacify
   God's wrath, satisfy every demand of His broken law, glorify His
   justice and holiness. So, too, has He made peace between the alienated
   Jew and Gentile: see Eph. 2:14-15. In a coming day He will yet make
   peace on this sin-cursed and war-stricken earth. When He shall sit upon
   the throne of His father, David, then shall be fulfilled that word, "Of
   the increase of his government and peace, there shall be no end" (Isa.
   9:7). Well may He be called "The Prince of Peace." Eighth, "Blessed are
   they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake." None was ever
   persecuted as was the Righteous One. What a word is that in Rev. 12:4!
   By the spirit of prophecy He declared, "I am afflicted and ready to die
   from my youth up" (Psa. 88:15). On His first public appearance we are
   told they "rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto
   the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast
   him down headlong" (Luke 4:29). In the temple precincts they "took up
   stones to cast at him" (John 9:59). All through His ministry His steps
   were dogged by enemies. The religious leaders charged Him with having a
   demon (John 8:38). Those who sat in the gate spake against Him, and He
   was the song of the drunkards (Psa. 69:12). At His trial they plucked
   off His hair (Isa. 50:6) , spat in His face, buffeted Him, and smote
   Him with the palms of their hands (Matt. 26:67). After He was scourged
   by the soldiers and crowned with thorns, carrying His own cross, He was
   led to Calvary, where they crucified Him. Even in His dying hours He
   was not left in peace, but was persecuted by revilings and scoffings.
   How unutterably mild in comparison is the persecution we are called on
   to endure for His sake! In like manner, each of the promises attached
   to the Beatitudes find their accomplishment in Christ. Poor in spirit
   He was, but His supremely is the kingdom. Mourn He did, yet will He be
   comforted as He sees of the travail of His soul. Meekness personified,
   yet shall He Sit on a throne of glory. He hungered and thirsted after
   righteousness, yet now is He filled with satisfaction as He beholds the
   righteousness He wrought imputed to His people. Pure in heart, He sees
   God as none other does (Matt. 11:27). As the Peacemaker, He is owned
   the Son of God by all the blood-bought children. As the persecuted One,
   great is His reward, having been given the Name above all others. May
   the Spirit of God occupy us more and more with Him who is fairer than
   the children of men.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 15

  Affliction and Glory

   "For our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a
   far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory"(2 Corinthians 4:17).

   These words supply us with a reason why we should not faint under
   trials nor be overwhelmed by misfortunes. They teach us to look at the
   trials of time in the light of eternity. They affirm that the present
   buffetings of the Christian exercise a beneficent effect on the inner
   man. If these truths were firmly grasped by faith they would mitigate
   much of the bitterness of our sorrows. "For our light affliction, which
   is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
   weight of glory." This verse sets forth a striking and glorious
   antithesis, as it contrasts our future state with our present. Here
   there is "affliction," there "glory." Here there is a "light
   affliction," there a "might of glory." In our affliction there is both
   levity and brevity; it is a light affliction, and it is but for a
   moment; in our future glory there is solidity and eternity! To discover
   the preciousness of this contrast let us consider, separately, each
   member, but in the inverse order of mention. 1. "A far more exceeding
   and eternal weight of glory." It is a significant thing that the Hebrew
   word for "glory"-kabod-also means "weight." When weight is added to the
   value of gold or precious stones this increases their worth. Heaven's
   happiness cannot be told out in the words of earth; figurative
   expressions are best calculated to convey some imperfect views to us.
   Here in our text one term is piled up on top of another. That which
   awaits the believer is "glory," and when we say that a thing is
   glorious we have reached the limits of human language to express that
   which is excellent and perfect. But the "glory" awaiting us is
   weighted, yea it is "far more exceeding" weighty than anything
   terrestrial and temporal; its value defies computation; its
   transcendent excellency is beyond verbal description. Moreover, this
   wondrous glory awaiting us is not evanescent and temporal, but Divine
   and eternal; for "eternal" it could not be unless it were Divine. The
   great and blessed God is going to give us that which is worthy of
   Himself, yea that which is like Himself-infinite and everlasting. 2.
   "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment." (1) "Affliction" is
   the common lot of human existence; "Man is born unto trouble as the
   sparks fly upward" (Job 5:7). This is part of the entail of sin. It is
   not meet that a fallen creature should be perfectly happy in his sins.
   Nor are the children of God exempted; "Through much tribulation we must
   enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22). By a hard and rugged road
   does God lead us to glory and immortality. (2) Our affliction is
   "light." Afflictions are not light in themselves for ofttimes they are
   heavy and grievous; but they are light comparatively! They are light
   when compared with what we really deserve. They are light when compared
   with the sufferings of the Lord Jesus. But perhaps their real lightness
   is best seen by comparing them with the weight of glory which is
   awaiting us. As said the same apostle in another place, "For I reckon
   that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared
   with the glory which shall be revealed in us" (Rom. 8:18). (3) "Which
   is but for a moment. Should our afflictions continue throughout a whole
   lifetime, and that life be equal in duration to Methuselah's, yet is it
   momentary if compared with the eternity which is before us. At most our
   affliction is but for this present life, which is as a vapor that
   appears for a little while and then vanishes away. Oh that God would
   enable us to examine our trials in their true perspective. 3. Note now
   the connection between the two. Our light affliction, which is but for
   a moment, "worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
   glory." The present is influencing the future. It is not for us to
   reason and philosophize about this, but to take God at His Word and
   believe it. Experience, feelings, observation of others, may seem to
   deny this fact. Ofttimes afflictions appear only to sour us and make us
   more rebellious and discontented. But let it be remembered that
   afflictions are not sent by God for the purpose of purifying the flesh:
   they are designed for the benefit of the "new man." Moreover,
   afflictions help to prepare us for the glory hereafter. Affliction
   draws away our heart from the love of the world; it makes us long more
   for the time when we shall be translated from this scene of sin and
   sorrow; it will enable us to appreciate (by way of contrast) the things
   which God had prepared for them that love Him. Here then is what faith
   is invited to do: to place in one scale the present affliction, in the
   other, the eternal glory. Are they worthy to be compared? No, indeed.
   One second of glory will more than counterbalance a whole lifetime of
   suffering. What are years of toil, of sickness, of battling against
   poverty, of persecution, yea, of a martyr's death, when weighed over
   against the pleasures at God's right hand, which are for evermore! One
   breath of Paradise will extinguish all the adverse winds of earth. One
   day in the Father's House will more than counterbalance the years we
   have spent in this dreary wilderness. May God grant unto us that faith
   which will enable us to anticipatively lay hold of the future and live
   in the present enjoyment of it.

CHAPTER 16

  Contentment

   "I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content"
   (Philippians 24:11).

   Discontent! Was there ever a time when there was so much restlessness
   in the world as there is today? We very much doubt it. Despite our
   boasted progress, the vast increase of wealth, the time and money
   expended daily in pleasure, discontent is everywhere. No class is
   exempt. Everything is in a state of flux, and almost everybody is
   dissatisfied. Many even among God's own people are affected with the
   evil spirit of this age. Contentment! Is such a thing realizable, or is
   it nothing more than a beautiful ideal, a mere dream of the poet? Is it
   attainable on earth or is it restricted to the inhabitants of heaven?
   If practicable here and now, may it be retained, or are a few brief
   moments or hours of contentment the most that we may expect in this
   life? Such questions as these find answer, an answer at least, in the
   words of the apostle Paul: "Not that I speak in respect of want: for I
   have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content" (Phil.
   4:11). The force of the apostle's statement will be better appreciated
   if his condition and circumstances at the time he made it be kept in
   mind. When the apostle wrote (or most probably dictated) the words, he
   was not luxuriating in a special suite in the Emperor's palace, nor was
   he being entertained in some exceptional Christian household, the
   members of which were marked by unusual piety. Instead, he was "in
   bonds" (cf. Phil. 1:13, 14); "a prisoner" (Eph. 4:1), as he says in
   another Epistle. And yet, notwithstanding, he declared he was content!
   Now, there is a vast difference between precept and practice, between
   the ideal and the realization. But in the case of the apostle Paul
   contentment was an actual experience, and one that must have been
   continuous, for he says, "in whatsoever state I am." How then did Paul
   enter into this experience, and of what did the experience consist? The
   reply to the first question is to be found in the word, "I have learned
   . . . to be content." The apostle did not say, "I have received the
   baptism of the Spirit, and therefore contentment is mine." Nor did he
   attribute this blessing to his perfect "consecration." Equally plain is
   it that it was not the outcome of natural disposition or temperament.
   It is something he had learned in the school of Christian experience.
   It should be noted, too, that this statement is found in an Epistle
   which the apostle wrote near the close of his earthly career! From what
   has been pointed out it should be apparent that the contentment which
   Paul enjoyed was not the result of congenial and comfortable
   surroundings. And this at once dissipates a vulgar conception. Most
   people suppose that contentment is impossible unless one can have
   gratified the desires of the carnal heart. A prison is the last place
   to which they would go if they were seeking a contented man. This much,
   then, is clear: contentment comes from within not without; it must be
   sought from God, not in creature comforts. But let us endeavor to go a
   little deeper. What is "contentment"? It is the being satisfied with
   the sovereign dispensations of God's providence. It is the opposite of
   murmuring, which is the spirit of rebellion-the clay saying to the
   Potter, "Why hast Thou made me thus?" Instead of complaining at his
   lot, a contented man is thankful that his condition and circumstances
   are no worse than they are. Instead of greedily desiring something more
   than the supply of his present need, he rejoices that God still cares
   for him. Such an one is "content" with such as he has (Heb. 13:5). One
   of the fatal hindrances to contentment is covetousness, which is a
   canker eating into and destroying present satisfaction. It was not,
   therefore, without good reason, that our Lord gave the solemn
   commandment to His followers-Take heed, and beware of covetousness"
   (Luke 12:15). Few things are more insidious. Often it poses under the
   fair name of thrift, or the wise safeguarding of the future-present
   economy so as to lay up for a "rainy day." The Scripture says,
   covetousness which is idolatry" (Col. 3:5)-the affection of the heart
   being set upon material things rather than upon God. The language of a
   covetous heart is that of the horseleach's daughter, Give! Give! The
   covetous man is always desirous of more, whether he has little or much.
   How vastly different the words of the apostle-"And having food and
   raiment let us be therewith content" (I Tim. 6:8). A much needed word
   is that of Luke 3:14: "Be content with your wages"! "Godliness with
   contentment is great gain" (I Tim. 6:6). Negatively, it delivers from
   worry and fretfulness, from avarice and selfishness. Positively, it
   leaves us free to enjoy what God has given us. What a contrast is found
   in the word which follows-"But they that will be (desire to be) rich
   fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful
   lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of
   money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they
   have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many
   sorrows" (I Tim. 6:9,10). May the Lord in His grace deliver us from the
   spirit of this world, and make us to be "content with such things as we
   have." Contentment, then, is the product of a heart resting in God. It
   is the soul's enjoyment of that peace which passeth all understanding.
   It is the outcome of my will being brought into subjection to the
   Divine will. It is the blessed assurance that God doeth all things
   well, and is, even now, making all things work together for my ultimate
   good. This experience has to be "learned" by "proving what is that
   good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God" (Rom. 12:2).
   Contentment is possible only as we cultivate and maintain that attitude
   of accepting everything which enters our lives as coming from the Hand
   of Him who is too wise to err, and too loving to cause one of His
   children a needless tear. Let our final word be this: real contentment
   is only possible by being much in the presence of the Lord Jesus. This
   comes out clearly in the verses which follow our opening text; "I know
   both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all
   things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound
   and suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which strengthens
   me" (Phil. 4:12, 13). It is only by cultivating intimacy with that One
   who was never discontent that we shall be delivered from the sin of
   complaining. It is only by daily fellowship with Him Who ever delighted
   in the Father's will that we shall learn the secret of contentment. May
   both writer and reader so behold in the mirror of the Word the glory of
   the Lord that we shall be "changed into the same image from glory to
   glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord" (2 Cor. 3:18).

CHAPTER 17

  Precious Death

   "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints" (Psalm
   116:15).

   This is one of the many comforting and blessed statements in Holy
   Scripture concerning that great event from which the flesh so much
   shrinks. If the Lord's people would more frequently make a prayerful
   and believing study of what the Word says upon their departure out of
   this world, death would lose much, if not all, of its terrors for them.
   But alas, instead of doing so, they let their imagination run riot,
   they give way to carnal fears, they walk by sight instead of by faith.
   Looking to the Holy Spirit for guidance, let us endeavor to dispel, by
   the light of Divine revelation, some of the gloom which unbelief casts
   around even the death of a Christian. "Precious in the sight of the
   Lord is the death of his saints." These words intimate that a dying
   saint is an object of special notice unto the Lord, for mark the words
   "in the sight of." It is true that the eyes of the Lord are ever upon
   us, for He never slumbers nor sleeps. It is true that we may say at all
   times "Thou God seest me." But it appears from Scripture that there are
   occasions when He notices and cares for us in a special manner. "God is
   our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble" (Psalm 46:1).
   "When thou passeth through the waters, I will be with thee" (Isaiah
   43:2). "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints."
   This brings before us an aspect of death which is rarely considered by
   believers. It gives us what may be termed the Godward side of the
   subject. Only too often, we contemplate death, like most other things,
   from our side. The text tells us that from the viewpoint of Heaven the
   death of a saint is neither hideous nor horrible, tragic or terrible,
   but "precious." This raises the question, Why is the death of His
   people precious in the sight of the Lord? What is there in the last
   great crisis which is so dear unto Him? Without attempting an
   exhaustive reply, let us suggest one or two possible answers:

   1. Their persons are precious to the Lord. They ever were and always
   will be dear to Him. His saints! They were the ones on whom His love
   was set before the earth was formed or the heavens made. These are they
   for whose sakes He left His Home on high and whom He bought with His
   precious blood, cheerfully laying down His life for them. These are
   they whose names are borne on our great High Priest's breast and
   engraven on the palms of His hands. They are His Father's love-gift to
   Him, His children, members of His body; therefore, everything that
   concerns them is precious in His sight. The Lord loves His people so
   intensely that the very hairs of their heads are numbered: the angels
   are sent forth to minister unto them; and because their persons are
   precious unto the Lord so also are their deaths.

   2. Because death terminates the saint's sorrows and sufferings. There
   is a needs-be for our sufferings, for through much tribulation we must
   enter into the kingdom of God (Acts 14:22). Nevertheless, the Lord does
   not "afflict willingly" (Lamentations 3:33). God is neither unmindful
   of nor indifferent to our trials and troubles. Concerning His people of
   old it is written, "In all their affliction he was afflicted" (Isaiah
   63:9). "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
   that fear him" (Psalm 103:13). So also are we told that our great High
   Priest is "touched with the feeling of our infirmities" (Heb. 4:15).
   Here, then, may be another reason why the death of a saint is precious
   in the sight of the Lord-because it marks the termination of his
   sorrows and sufferings.

   3. Because death affords the Lord an opportunity to display His
   sufficiency. Love is never so happy as when ministering to the needs of
   its cherished object, and never is the Christian so needy and so
   helpless as in the hour of death. But man's extremity is God's
   opportunity. It is then that the Father says to His trembling child,
   "Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed, for I am thy God:
   I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee
   with the right hand of my righteousness" (Isaiah 41:10). It is because
   of this that the believer may confidently reply, "Yea, though I walk
   through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
   Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me." Our very
   weakness appeals to His strength, our emergency to His sufficiency.
   Most blessedly is this principle illustrated in the well-known words
   "He shall gather the lambs (the helpless ones) with his arm, and carry
   them in his bosom" (Isaiah 40:11). Yes, His strength is made perfect in
   our weakness. Therefore is the death of the saints "precious" in His
   sight because it affords the Lord a blessed occasion for His love,
   grace and power to minister unto and undertake for His helpless people.

   4.Because at death the saint goes direct to the Lord. The Lord delights
   in having His people with Himself. Blessedly was this evidenced all
   through His earthly ministry. Wherever He went, the Lord took His
   disciples along with Him. Whether it was to the marriage at Cana, to
   the holy feasts in Jerusalem, to the house of Jairus when his daughter
   lay dead, or to the Mount of Transfiguration, they ever accompanied
   Him. How blessed is that word in Mark 3:14, "He ordained twelve, that
   they should be with him." And He is "the same yesterday and today and
   for ever." Therefore has He assured us, "If I go and prepare a place
   for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself, that where I
   am, there ye may be also" (John 14:3). Precious then is the death of
   the saints in His sight, because absent from the body we are "present
   with the Lord" (II Cor. 5:8). While we are sorrowing over the removal
   of a saint, Christ is rejoicing. His prayer was "Father, I will that
   they also, whom Thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they
   may behold my glory" (John 17:24), and in the entrance into Heaven of
   each one of His own people, He sees an answer to that prayer and is
   glad. He beholds in each one that is freed from "this body of death"
   another portion of the reward for His travail of soul, and He is
   satisfied with it. Therefore the death of His saints is precious to the
   Lord, for it occasions Him ground for rejoicing. It is most interesting
   and instructive to trace out the fullness of the Hebrew word here
   translated "precious." it is also rendered "excellent." "How excellent
   is Thy loving kindness, Oh God!" (Psa. 36:7). "A man of understanding
   is of an excellent spirit" (Prov. 17:27). However worthily or
   unworthily he may live, the death of a saint is excellent in the sight
   of the Lord. The same Hebrew word is also rendered "honourable."
   "Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women" (Psa. 45:9). So
   Ahasuerus asked of Haman, "What shall be done unto the man whom the
   king delighteth to honour?" (Esther 6:6). Yes, the exchange of heaven
   for earth is truly honourable, and "This honour have all his saints.
   Praise ye the Lord." This Hebrew word is also rendered "brightness."
   "If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness"
   (Job 31:26). Dark and gloomy though death may be unto those whom the
   Christian leaves behind, it is brightness "in the sight of the Lord":
   "at evening time it shall be light" (Zech. 14:7). Precious, excellent,
   honourable, brightness in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
   saints. May the Lord make this little meditation precious unto His
   saints.

   THE END OF COMFORT FOR CHRISTIANS
